This memorandum reports the results of two net file} :
Assistant Directors Wannall and Mintz and Section Chief Cregar
had with Attorney General (AG) Levi on 10/6/75.

As a result of telephonic instructions received
from AG Levi on the evening of 10/4/75, approximately 30
employees of the Intelligence and Files and Communications
Divisions worked all day Sunday, 10/5/75, in an effort to
develop a list of all electronic surveillances conducted by
the FBI from 1/1/70 through 6/30/75, as well as recovering \ / 3;
all supportive documents underlying requests for these wT
electronic surveillances. The list and supportive documents
were to be delivered to the AG's office at 9:00 a.m., on
10/6/75.

.At approximately 9:00 a.m., 10/6/75, Messrs, Wannall,

Mintz and Cregar met with the AG and provided him with the

list he requested, as well as approximately 30 percent of the
supportive documents we were able to uncover during a 10-hour
period, on Sunday, 10/5/75, The AG indicated that he had a
meeting at the White House for 10:00 a.m., that morning and
planned to take the list provided to him by the FBI with him,

He did indicate that it was not his intention at this time

to give the White House or Congressman Pike, Chairman of the
House Select Committee (HSC). who was to be, % 4 Be ep

meeting, a copy of theghigit- REC-26 Go aly ee Wi

Following the AG's return to his office, whemrequested
Messrs, Wannall, Mintz and Cregar meet with him, along with

Re: Hemstudy 75
62-32:6395

bipey

The AG confirmed that he had not given either the
White House or Congressman Pike copies of the list prepared
by the Bureau. He did say, however, that as a result of the
White House meeting he desired the Bureau to do the following:

1. Arrange for a briefing of selected members of
the HSC on electronic surveillances and break-ins.

We have already briefed the Church Committee

on this same subject and are prepared to provide
such a briefing to the HSC as soon as d date
can be set.

2. Prepare a chart reflecting the number of
electronic surveillances conducted by the Bureau during the
period 1/1/70 through 6/30/75. broken down into various
categories previously established by the AG.

This project is already underway and we
anticipate the chart will be ready for
delivery to the AG by 10/9/75.

3. The Intelligence Division continue to recover
all. supportive documents underlying the request for electronic
surveillances and excise them in order that they can be
delivered to the House Select Committee.

This is an extremely time-consuming job.

On Sunday, 10/5/75, we had 10 Agents searching,
reviewing and Xeroxing the supportive documents
that the AG had requested. We have completed
approximately 30 percent of that project. We
are currently in the process of locating and
Xeroxing all remaining supportive documents,

LMOYoe

The Attorney General stated he arranged for the

briefing mentioned in item 1 above to try to satisfy insistent
demands made by Congressman Pike for information immediately
and that he felt it was necessary to follow up the briefing
with material as soon as possible and,if necessary, on a piece-
meal basis.

In view of the instructions of the Attorney General,
we are proceeding as rapidly as possible to comply with the
foregoing. It should be noted, however, that in complying
we will be furnishing to the HSC more information and/or
material than has been furnished to the Senate Select Committee (SSC)
with respect to these specific areas.

ACTION:

(1) It is recommended that in the day-to-day liaison
between our Office of Legal Counsel and Mr. Shaheen of the
Department efforts be continued to establish working rules
for the HSC similar to those established for the SSC.

will be submitted for the Director's approval and the excised
supportive documents will be forwarded to the HSC in accordance
with previously approved procedures.

we received four requests from the House Committee alone. ~
Many of the requests involve complex research and review of :

Bureau materials, etc. We have recently experienced cecal a i

Shaheen subsequently advised SA Daly that he had
brought this matter to the attention of the Senate Select
Committee orally in a conversation with Mark Gitenstein on
9/4/75 including the problems being encountered with in-
dividual Staff Members declaring that their particular
request had a higher priority than any other particular

‘xequest. Gitenstein told Shaheen that he would attempt to

correct this problem.

In a subsequent conversation with Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein, Gitenstein stated he had been informed by the
Department of the problem the Bureau is encountering in
responding within the deadlines set for various Committee
requests. He indicated that he would take steps to make
sure individual Staff Members. do not on their own initiative
attempt to place their request ahead of any other particular
request without coordinating it with him. Additionally, he
stated it was. his intention to bring this to the attention of
John Elliff, Task Force Director of the Domestic Task Force of
the Senate Select Committee, and suggest a meeting be held with
Bureau representatives on Monday , 9/8/75, in an effort to solve
this particular problem. If a meeting is held on that date, it
is expected that a representative of the Intelligence Division,
Legal Counsel Division and the Department will be in attendance.

Attached is a White House memorandum! to the Attorney
General dated September 29, 1975, enclosing a memorandum fur-
nished the White House by Aaron Donner, Counsel for the House
Select Committee , captioned "Yoncompliance with Written Re-
quests.'

The attached document was the subject of a discussion
on the evening of 9/29/75 between the Attorney General; John
Marsh, who is a Counsel for the President; Michael E. Shaheen,
Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the De-
partment; and his Deputy, Steven Blackhurst. The Attorney
General, according to information furnished SA Paul V. Daly
of this Division the evening of 9/29/75, desired to know the
accuracy of the. House Select Committee document alleging non-
compliance with written requests. Blackhurst and Shaheen_ f
informed the Attorney General and Marsh that the Bureau was, es
in compliance with requests with the exception that at the ye
instructions of the Department classified material was being
withheld from the Committee. Blackhurst requested on 9/29/75
that the Bureau review the attached House Select Committee
document and determine whether in fact the Bureau is in re-
ceipt of any requests that are outstanding pertaining to
these six numbered items listed on that document.

In conjunction with the Intelligence Division, a
review was made of the six items listed on the House Select
Committee document entitled "Noncompliance with Written Re-~
quests" and it was determi: fhat with respect to questions
#1 and #3 pertaining to thé Gon Plan and electronic sur-
veillance of Martin Luther King, Jr., respectively, the Com-

RE: HOUSTUDY

q Granting the Committee access, but not delivery is
in accordance with Departmental instructions. The Départment,
as is set forth in my memorandum of 8/22/75, instrueted that

the Committee was not to be given delivery of material relating
to Martin Luther King, Jr., or the 1964 Democratic National Con-
. vention nor were they to be given delivery of documents which
were delivered to the Senate Select Committee after July 22,
1975, The Department indicated that the July 22nd letter of

the Committee requesting delivery of all documents which have
. been furnished the Senate Select Committee to be interpreted

so as to not make available those documents furnished the

Senate Select Committee after the date of their letter. With
respect to the Huston Plan documents, these documents were not
delivered to the Senate Select Committee until 8/5/75 and thus
were after the July 22nd date and, therefore, have not been fur-
nished the House Select Committee.

With respect ‘to the remaining four items. listed in the
House Select Committee document, we can find no record of the
House Select Committee having made such a request nor can the De-
partment in their records. By way of explanation, all requests
for material from the House Select Committee are delivered to
the Department and then forwarded to the Bureau.

Blackhurst was advised of the aforementioned information
concerning the Bureau's review of House Select Committee requests.
He stated that Marsh advised the Attorney General that the Depart-
ment and Bureau could ‘anticipate receiving a subpoena in the near
future from the House Select Committee pertaining to noncompliance
with requests and it was his intention to insure the Attorney Gen-
eral was aware of the inaccuracies in the. House Select Committee

Reference is made to Legal Gounsel memorandum
dated 9/15/75, wherein it was stated that Steven Blackhurst,
Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the
Department, telephonically advised on 9/15/75, that the Depart,
ment had been instructed by James Wilderotter, Associate
Counsel to the President, not to furnish any classified ~
material to the House Select Committee on Intelligence (HSCY-

On 10/3/75, Mr. Blackhurst advised SAs Elmer W. -
Larson, Jr., and Andrew J. Duffin that The White House has
subsequently advised the Department that the instructions
given on 9/15/75 are no longer valid and the HSC is now to
receive classifie ial. He noted that certain material
that the Departmet Ss withholding from the HSC which had a
previously been furnished by the Bureau, has now been passed
to the HSC.

In addition, on 10/3/75, Mr. Blackhurst conferred
with SAs Larson and Duffin concerning the lack of ground
rules existing with the HSC, as are in effect with the SSC.

Due to the absence of basic ground rules with the
HSC, it was'agreed upon that any materials prepared by the
Bureau for either access or delivery to the HSC should have
all sources excised therefrom inepuding the identities of any
persons where implied confidentiatY» might exist. Should ‘
the HSC request the identity of a sp#cific individual subsequent

to reviewing or receiving any material, the Glos ig proc
will be followed: tA 7, ya hashed exe
1) If th dividual nec fid a L
the individual is a confident oC icular
sensitive source, either current or former, Tee CAE Es

would require concealment, the HSC will be adyjised sbhrough..,
the Department that the identity cannot be revealed.

2) Should the person be an individual who has
previously requested confidentiality or where there is an
implied confidential arrangement, this individual will be
contacted and advised that the HSC has requested his specific
identity. Subsequent to this, if the individual has indicated
he desires to remain confidential, the HSC will be advised
through Department that his identity cannot be revealed. On
the other hand, if the individual advised that his identity
may be furnished to the HSC, same will be done.

It is noted that this is the position previously
taken by the Attorney General and agreed to by Director Kelley
in connection with a prior confrontation in this area involving
the Senate Select Committee.

Mr. Blackhurst advised that he does not anticipate
the HSC requesting the identities of many excised sources,

por
DETAILS : ~f

Ip

By Letter dated 8/19/75, HSC requested a list of “ser
all proprietaries maintained by the FBI, as well as infor-
mation concerning their operation. By letter to the Attorney
General dated 9/10/75, with enclosed letter to Congressman
Pike, HSC Chairman, the Director pointed out the sensitive
nature of such operations and offered ENE with Congressman

Pike and discuss with him the operation o: proprietaries
(two deak with national security and four in the organized
crime field) currently being operated by this Bureau.* 7?
. PER C2 fir. PR
At the request of the reper eA he was a

arranged for the morning of 10/8/75 by the Legal Counsel

Division to further discuss the manner in which the HSC's

inquiry concerning proprietaries will be satisfied. Present

at the meeting were Peter Hughes, HSC Staff Member, Steven
Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordi-
nation, Department of Justice, and Bureau Specit#=Agents ===
John E, McHale, Special Investigative Division, and Thomas J.

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

Congressman Pike because of the restriction imposed about

that time concerning the furnishing of classified information
to the HSC, Upon removal of this restriction, the letter

was not’ forwarded by the Department in view of Congressman
Pike's expressed opposition to being the sole recipient of
information furnished by the intelligence community in response
to HSC inquiries. The purpose of this meeting, therefore,

was to arrive at some arrangement by which the HSC inquiry
into this sensitive field could be satisfied while at the same
time protecting this Bureau's interests.

At the meeting, Mr. Hughes proposed that he be
briefed in general terms concerning this Bureau's operation
lof proprietaries. He stated at this time the HSC is not
interested in specifics but is interested in ascertaining
the field of this Bureau's operations maintaining proprietaries,
Concerning each proprietary, he would like to learn the
general area of the country in which it is located, its
purpose, how it is operated with regard to personnel and
organizational set up, initial cost factor, handling of
profits resulting therefrom and reporting of financial aspects
of such operations to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

In response to questions from.Bureau representatives,
\Mr. Hughes advised that, upon receiving such information, he
would, in turn, similarly brief House Committee Members,
This information would also be made available to HSC Staff
Members having a need to know. He also advised that the HSC
reserves the right anytime after the briefing to make specific
inquiries concerning any of these operations should it be
decided by the HSC that such a need exists. Mr, Hughes was
advised by Bureau representatives that approval would be sought
to furnish him with the requested briefing but the Bureau views
the operation of proprietaries in the same light as it views

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

the identity of informants and it is felt that this Bureau
would resist the furnishing of any specific information which
could in any way prejudice these sensitive operations,

Mr. Blackhurst advised that he saw no objection to the
briefing under guidelines set forth above, and should additional
specific inquiries be forthcoming, that problem could be
addressed at that time. Mr. Hughes concluded by stating he
would appreciate ascertaining by 10/9/75 whether or not he
would be afforded the briefing as requested and, if affirma-
tive, that the briefing be arranged for early in the week of
10/13/75.

" OBSERVATIONS :

From the comments made by Mr, Hughes, it is apparent
that the primary HSC interest in proprietaries is the financial
aspects principally as it pertains to funds received from the
disposal of goods or services offered and the manner in which
reports are being made, if any, to . .. IRS concerning such
operations. It can be fully expected after the briefing
that additional specific inquiries will be forthcoming
concerning at least some of these proprietaries so that HSC
can verify the information provided, It is felt that the
Bureau at this timé should comply with the HSC request for a
briefing in general terms (using a code or acronym to identify
each proprietary) to display to the HSC a.cooperative attitude
as long as current Bureau operations are not adversely affected.
Should additional requests be forthcoming for specific infor-
mation which would tend to identify or prejudice any of these
operations, it is felt that the Director should assume the
same posture as he did concerning his refusal to disclose
the identity of current sources and the matter then be referred
to the Attorney General for adjudication.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. That the Intelligence Division on 10/9/75
advise Mr, Blackhurst of the Department that Bureau repre-
sentatives will afford Mr, Hughes a general briefing as
requested concerning this Bureau's operation of proprietaries.

yea expeditiously prepare material for a general briefing concerning
proprietaries along the lines of the requests of Mr. Hughes
set forth above. When such material is available, these
representatives should advise Mr. Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel
Division, no later than 10/14/75 so that arrangements can be
effected with Mr. Hughes.

‘yore:

A survey of Section Chiefs by SA James .W. Johnson,
Intelligence Division indicated two proprietaries (businesses)
are maintained; code name cases Korsaj and Toolup are maintained
in conjunction with the Orkid case. Orkid is code name for
our program to technically penetrate the new Soviet Embassy
complex at Mount Alito, Wisconsin Avenue, Northwest, Washington,

j De C. Korsaj is code name for our purchase and subsequent

management, through a cutout, of the apartment building,

Highview Towers, 2700 Wisconsin Avenue, Northwest, Washington,

D. C. Toolup is code name for the rented test facilities for
equipment and techniques being developed under the Orkid program.
The facilities are located at 2301 and 2361 South Jefferson Davis
Highway, Arlington, Virginia. :

Senstudy Representative SA J. William Hines, General
Investigative Division advised no proprietaries are currently
being maintained, 7

A survey by Senstudy Representative John E. McHale
indicates the Special Investigative Division is currently
conducting four proprietary operations in the fieid of organized
erime, which, to date, have cost a total of $44,000 in building
and equipment rental, utility and freight employees, the pw chase
of office supplies, property inventory, etc. (some of which will
be recoverable at the conclusion of the investigations).

"These are active ongoing cases, the disclosure of such
information could result in physical harm to individuals involved.
A briefing in general terminology on these operations is being
prepared. The FBI has also assisted a number of state and local
agencies utilizing their own funds and/or grants from the Law
ania nAMisfinnEi Assistance Administration {LEAA)

The only such proprietary currently in operation has
heen called to the attention of the Department in the cover letter.
This operation is primarily funded by LEAA.

Appropriate briefing material will be prepared by
representatives of intexested Divisions, upon notification this
procedure is acceptable to HSC.

D. "WHY COMPILE CRIME STATISTICS?" ~ SUGGESTED RESPOASES
1. This is a cooperative project of the police themselves. The FBI acts
merely as the clearing house and it is glad to serve law enforcement in
this way.
2. The IACP says that law enforcement agencies should have adequate records;
that it is good business, The statistical reports are just by-products,

a UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING ®@

The presentation of basic crime data to the public helps get the very
necessary public support needed for successful law enforcement work.

‘A comparison of crime increases with population increases may be of yalue
in supporting requests for increased appropriations.

Similarly, if the police strength is bélow the average, this can be shown
in requesting more personnel, Such averages are available only through
the cooperation of law enforcement ageucies in the uniform crime reporging
program,

The sheriff and the chief of police in facing re~election or reappoint—
ment each needs facts to show that his administration has been efficient
Contributing crime data to a national bienhaniirate aaibiad is a’mark of an up—
to-date Brogressive organization.

If the chief or sheriff says that he has no crime or few crimes to. report,
he'should be proud,to have such a record on file.-

If there is no one on duty at headquarters to record complaints or no
office is maintained, encourage members of the agency to make notes and
to later record their notes in an office record, such as "Register of
Offenses Known," In the absence of other data the Bureau needs the number
of offenses (column 4 of Return A) and a very minimum procedure would be
for notes to be kept on a tally sheet during the month. Under such
circumstances, the agency’ will not average one offense daily.

It is customary for most okfenses of the types on Return A to be prosecuted
An the courts of the county aid so persons arrested by police are often
turned over'to the sheriff, Also, in sm2ll towns or cities the sheriff
or state police may assist in or handle entirely the investigation of
eertain orimes and the police may limit their activities almost to traffic
matters, In either situation, we need a report from the police. The

. police will or oan know about a crime in their town even though they “don't

| ww_sa960 _Doeid: 32989725 Page 116

handle it." The reports of sheriffs or state police are limited to crimes
in rural areas outside of urban places (incorporated places with 2,500 or
more inhabitants). So, we need a’ report from-the urban police or their
community will not be represented in our coverage.

1. Obstruction of justice and criminal investigations.

Fall details of complaints must be furnished the Bureau expeditiously to—
gether with action being taken or recommended, Although USA ordinarily
advised of all complaints, if, in sound judgement of SAC, circumstances of
complaint or facts developed through investigation make it inadvisable to
consult USA or to follow course desired by him, advise Bureau and
take no further action pending Bureau instructions,

a. SAC may authorize investigation on request of USA or Federal judge in
following situations:
(1) If obstruction arose from case investigated by FBI, Aad Obstruc—
ope of Justice to character of case and do not open separate : as
Le. q
(2) If obstruction arose from criminal case within jurisdiction of z
any Federal agency other than Secret Service, Internal Revenue
Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, [U. S. Customs 3
Service, |Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, 1
. Tobaeco and Firearms, and U. S. Postal Service. i
(3}) If obstruction involves either actual, bodily harm or threat t
thereof to a Federal judge or Federal juror, regardless of case
out of which allegation arose,
i (4) If obstruction arose from civil case in Federal court in which
neither U, S, Government nor any agency thereof is involved,

b. Prior Bureau authority is required where offense arose from:

(1) @rial in which original investigation conducted by one of above
mentioned agencies,

2 Proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees,

3) Labor controversy or other matter affecting national security.

If obstruction arose from case within jurisdiction of seven agencies men-
tioned above, it is position of Bureau and Department of Justice that
obstruction investigation should be conducted by the other agency although
coverage of leads in a distant area to assist the other agency may be
-authorized by Bureau upon full justification.

Before instituting authorized investigation related to trial in progress
or about to begin, the USA must assure that the judge has been informed
and is agreeable to investigation. Authority of USA and judge is necessary
-for interviews with witnesses or jurors in a pending trial. If an inter-
view with a juror in a pending trial is requested, attention of the judge
and USA should be directed to Supreme Court decisions in Remmer v. U, S,
347 U. S. 227, 350 U. S. 3773 and Gold v. U. S., 352 U. S. 985 (1957).
Tactfully inform them that in light of the Supreme Court's opinion in .
above cases, USA may desire to discuss the matter with the Criminal Divi-
sion of the Department for clearance of investigation.

2. Obstruction of court orders
Obstruction of court order complaints or requests for investigation
should be referred to the Bureau by telephone, teletype, airtel, or MSD
letter, depending upon the urgency of the particular situation.

Department has instructed USAs not to request FBI investigation or initiate
prosecution of obstruction of court orders without departmental authority.
Immediately advise the Bureau of any request for investigation with your
recommendation as to whether investigation should be conducted. Conduct
no investigation without Bureau authority.

Q@eox 76. OBSTRUCTION OF suserc@ - 76D
OBSTRUCTION OF COURT ORDERS ~
OBSTRUCTION OF CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATIONS

D. - INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE

Statutes treated in this chapter are designed to protect the dignity of
courts and prevent corruption and obstruction in the administration of
justice, Prosecutions in such cases generally result in widespread public
notice and editorial comment. Investigation and testimony of Agents
must be of such caliber that credit will be reflected on the Bureau,
Status of an individual as a person covered by the statutes may be
established through introduction by competent witnesses of letters

of appointment, official records of the court, subpoenas, summonses,
jury panels, and similar documents, Such records can generally be
located in the offices of Government agencies, clerks of court, U. 8.
Magistrates, land U. Ss Marshals. The exact time when a person received
appointment or was served with a subpoena or summons should be reported.

If investigations involving witnesses or jurors indicate possible
perjury, necessary elements of perjury and subornation of perjury
violations should be fully developed.

Question victims closely for complete details. Threats or use of
force may have been preceded by other acts by subject, such as
conversations, gratuities, and advice extended to victim in a disguised
effort to curry his favor, Obtain signed statements where possible
from victim and witnesses, and USA should be advised of any reluctance
to testify.

Bureau has no statutory authority to afford "protection" to persons

“affected by these statutes, When such persons request protection,

they should be referred to USA. These persons frequently appear at
Bureau offices to gain "moral support” and should be treated with
consideration, When victim fears physical harm, appropriate looal
law enforcement agency should be informed unless facts of case
indicate this action undesirable,

Trace threatening letters or other communications to the accused by
examinations of handwriting, typewriting, checks of hotel records, and
such other means as are available. In event the communication is
directed to or received by a person other than the intended victim,
the relationship of the recipient to the victim should be shown,

since under statute a violation may exist even if victim is not direct
recipient of communication. Determine exact language of communication
and all attending circumstances as it may be necessary to introduce
evidence that a communication, although veiled, actually implies a
threat. Follow instructions relative to transmittal. of extortion
letters to FBI Laboratory in the transmittal of letters constituting
possible violations of obstruction of justice statutes.

Determine the particular interest of subject in the outcome of a trial
or other proceeding. Subject's relationship by blood or marriage to
parties to a suit, his membership in an interested organization, or
monetary considerations may explain his actions, Determination of
identities of persons who stand to gain from the particular outcome of
@ proceeding may serve to identify an unknown subject.

It must be shown that the threat, show of force, or communication was
for one of the purposes enumerated in the statutes, The act itself
may clearly indicate the purpose but corroborative evidence may be
required, In event of injury to the person or property of a witness,

subject committed the act to influence the performance of duty, or
because of such performance, rather than because of some extraneous

By National Security Action Memorandum 161 dated 6-9-62, the Attorney
General was ‘given primary responsibility for taking the initiative

in the Government in ensuring the development of plans, programs, and
action proposals to protect the internal security of the U. S. At

were to continue unchanged, except that their reports or recommendations
were to be directed to him rather than the National Security Council.
Division of internal security field

The field of internal security is now divided between TIC and ICIS.

Any information which concerns action in the field covered by the ICIS
should be promptly furnished to the Bureau by letter in order that the
information may be referred to ICIS, Samples of this type of activity
would be plans concerning physical protection of Government buildings or
key industrial plants, entry into and exit from the U, S., civilian
defense, and other internal security matters not specifically covered by
“the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference, Essentially, the ICis

is an action committee as contrasted to the information gathering character
of the IIC.

United States Intelligence Board (USIB)

The USIB, formerly known as the Intelligence Advisory Committee, was
established by National Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID)
#1, approved by the President on 9-15-58, The USIB maintains the
relationships essential to coordination between the Central Intelligence
Agency and the other intelligence organizations. It is a group with.
which the Director of CIA consults and which examines and passes on
national intelligence estimates before release to the National Security
Council and the President. The USIB deals almost exclusively with
foreign intelligence matters, The FBI is represented in order that
foreign intelligence may be coordinated with domestic intelligence.

[In accordance with NSCID #1, the membership of USIB is as follows:

The Director of Central Intelligence, Chairman; The Deputy Director
of Central Intelligence, Vice Chairman; the Director of Intelligence
and Research, Department of State; The Director, Defense Intelligence
Agency; The Director, National Security Agency; a representative of

dent's Memorandum of June 26, 1939, as augmented by his Directive of
September 6, 1939, the Delimitations Agreement of February 9, 1942, and
the Presidential Directive of October 30, 1947, In addition, cognizance

| the specific application of that Act is set forth in Section II hereof,
All other provisions of this Agreement are apart from and have no relation
| to the stated requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. In view of the
above, it is now agreed that responsibility for the investigation of all
activities coming under the categories of espionage, counterespionage,
| subversion and sabotage (hereinafter referred to as ‘these categories!

by one organization in 2 given field carries with it the obligation to
| exchange freely and directly with the other subscribing organizations
all information of mutual interest, When the organization with primary
| operating responsibility is unable for any reason to produce material
in that field desired by the subscribing agencies, such special arrange~
| ments as may be legal or desirable will be worked out through negotia~
| tion at the national level prior to activity by one agency in another
agency's field. It is recognized by the subscribers hereto that the
Headquarters Department of the Army has decentralized such functions
to its major subordinate commanders. When the major subordinate com—
manders of the Department of the Army cannot effect satisfactory
special arrangements, the matter will be referred to the Director of
Intelligence of the Army for further negotiations at the national level.
Close cooperation and coordination between the four subscribing organiza—
tions is a mutually recognized necessity.

"APPENDIX B

PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT MILITARY’
INTERESTS, NOT INVOLVING MARTIAL LAW

"I, In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as potential
theaters of operation. ‘When an armed forces commander of such a potential
theater is designated, he definitely has interest in, though not control of,
the civilian life within the area. in order that the armed forces commander
may prepare himself for the discharge of the possible responsibility which
may affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:

"l. Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army; and the OST, IG, U.S. Air
Force will continue to function in accordance with the provisions of Sections
II, III, Iv, and vy.

"2. In addition thereto, the, armed forces commander may teke steps
to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the manner in which com"
plete coverage will be obtained if martial law is declared. Adequate liaison

with the other subscribing agencies will insure that the armed forces commander

will have the benefit of the experience, judgment and beets of the repre-
sentatives of the other agencies.

"3, The armed forces commander is authorized to request and receive
such information from the other three agencies as he may desire and they. may
be able to furnish. 5

"II. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the coverage

. furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any additional coverage each
“subscribing agency can undertake. ‘When the commander feels that more complete

coverage is required, it is recognized that he is authorized to augment the
coverage with such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his

, jurisdiction. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally coming under
-, the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies, the armed forces commander

should obtain the necessary authority from the Secretary of Defense.

Placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces commander, whenever
any of the other services feel that such a survey to determine adequacy of
coverage should be undertaken, it should be so recommended,"

Divisional Offices, Military Intelligence Officers of the pertinent
Armies, District Officers of the Office of Special Investigations,

; Inspector General, U. S. Air Force, and Naval District Intelligence
Officers will maintain close personal liaison between those offices
and their representatives, including a meeting of representatives of
the four agencies, preferably the officers in charge, at least twice
per month, for the purpose of discussing pending and contemplated
investigative activities, and any other subject necessary to insure
that there is proper coordination of their investigative work,

"(b) The close personal liaison to be maintained between represent—

atives of the four agencies at all times should insure that there is

no duplication of effort in any field, and that a proper coverage of

the whole investigative field is maintained. Partioular attention

should be paid to avoiding any duplication in connection with the use
. of informers,

"(c) A distinction should be recognized between the investigative
interest of individual agencies and the coverage interest, It is
believed that all four’ agencies should study, from time to time, the
coverage of the investigative field in order to insure that all
channels of interest and avenues of information are adequately
covered by at least one of the participating agencies.

"(a) Where there is doubt as to whether or not one of the other
agencies is interested in information collected, it should be trans—
mitted to the other agency.

"(e) Consideration should be given to the fact that certain classes
of information are of general interest to the Military, Naval, and,

This supplement recommends meetings at least twice monthly of
the interested agencies, Where desirable or necessary, these
meetings may be held more often than twice per month and in
certain areas, because of the travel distances involved or other
factors, meetings are being held once per month by special
agreement. It is not necessary that the Bureau be advised of
the business discussed at these meetings, unless there is a
particular matter of which the Bureau should be cognizant. The
Bureau should be promptly informed of any change in the schedul—
ing of these meetings or of any agreement to commence or dis-
continue meetings in a field office area,

C. INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF MILITARY PERSONNEL

(1.

Agreement betweea the Departments of Justice and Defense]

The following agreement was approved and entered into by the Departments
of Justice and Defense relative to the investigation and prosecution of
orimes committed by individuals subject to the Uniform Code of Military
Justice: ‘

"MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUSTICE AND
DEFENSE RELATING TO THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF CRIMES OVER
WHICH THE TWO DEPARTMENTS HAVE CONCURRENT JURISDICTION

whereas , certain crimes committed by individuals subject to the Uniform
Code of Military Justice may be prosecuted by military tribunals under
that Code or by civilian authorities in the Federal Courts; and

“Whereas, it is recognized that although the administration and discipline
of the armed services require that certain types of crimes committed by
their personnel be investigated by those services and prosecuted before
military tribunals, other types of crimes committed by military personnel
should be investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted before civil

‘i tribunals; and

"Whereas, it is recognized that it is not feasible to impose inflexible
rules to determine the respeotive responsibility of the civilian and
military authorities as to each crime over which they may have concurrent
jurisdiction and that informal arrangements and agreements may be necessary
with respect to specific crimes or investigations; and

“Whereas, agreement between the Department of Justice and the Department

. Of Defense as to the general areas in which they will investigate and

prosecute crimes to which both civil and military jurisdiction attach will,
nevertheless, tend to make the investigation and prosecution of crimes

_more expeditious and efficient and give appropriate effect to the policies

of civil government and the requirements of the armed forces:

"It is hereby agreed and understood between the Department of Justice and
the Department of Defense as follows:

"1, Crimes committed on military installations, Except as hereinafter
indicated, all crimes committed on a military installation by individuals
subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice shall be investigated
and prosecuted by the military department concerned if such department
makes a determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that only

“individuals subject to the Uniform Code, of Military Justice are involved

in such crime as principals or accessories, and, except in extraordinary
cases, that there is no victim other than persons who are subject to the
Uniform Code of Military Justice or who are bona fide dependents or members
of a household of military or civilian personnel residing on the installa—
tion. Unless such a determination is made, the military department con-
cerned shall promptly advise the Federal Bureau of Investigation of any
crime committed on a military installation if such crime is within the
investigative authority of the FBI. The FBI shall investigate any serious
erime of which it has been so advised for the purpose of prosecution in

the civil courts unless the Department of Justice determines that investiga—
tion and prosecution may be conducted more efficiently and expeditiously

by the military department concerned. Even if the determination provided
for in the first sentence of this paragraph is made by the military depart—
ment concerned, it shall promptly advise the FBI of any orime committed on
a military installation in which there is a victim who is not subject to

the Uniform Code of Military Justice or a bona fide dependent or member

of the household of military or civilian personnel residing on the installa-
tion and that such department is investigating the crime because it has
been determined to be extraordinary. The military department concerned

"shall promptly advise the Federal Bureau of Investigation whenever the
crime, except in minor offenses, involves fraud against the government,
misappropriation, robbery, or theft of government property or funds, or
is of a similar nature, All such crimes shall be investigated by the
military department concerned unless it receives prompt advice that the
Department of Justice has determined that the crime should be investigated
by the FBI and that the FBI will undertake the investigation for the pur-
pose of prosecution in the civil courts,

"2, Crimes committed outside of military installations, Except as
hereinafter indicated, all crimes committed outside of military installa~
tions, which fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the PBI and

in which there is involved as a suspect an individual subject to the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, shall be investigated by the FBI for the
purpose of prosecution in civil courts, unless the Department of Justice
determines that investigation and prosecution may be conducted more

come first to the attention of military authorities shall be referred
promptly by them to the FBI, unless relieved of this requirement by the
FBI as to particular types or classes of crimes, However, whenever mili-
tary personnel are engaged in scheduled military activities outside of
military installations such as organized maneuvers or organized movement,
the provisions of paragraph 1 above shall apply, unless persons not sub—

accessories or victims, cs

"If, however, there is involved as a suspect or as an accused in any

crime committed outside of a military installation and falling within the
investigative authority of the FBI an individual who is subject to the
Uniform,Code of Military Justice and if.the military authorities believe

discipline of the armed forces which would justify investigation by them
for the purpose of prosecution before a military tribunal, they shall
promptly advise the FBI of the crime and indicate their views on the matter,
Investigation of such a crime may be undertaken by the military authorities
if the Department of Justice agrees.

"3, Transfer of investigative authority, An investigative body which has
initiated an investigation pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof shall
have.exclusive investigative authority and may proceed therewith to prosecu-

Agreement between the Departments of Justice and Transportation

The following agreement was approved and entered into between the Depart~

‘ments of Justice and Transportation relative to the investigation and

prosecution of crimes committed by members of the U. S. Coast Guard

subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice:

“MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUSTICE AND
TRANSPORTATION (COAST GUARD) RELATING TO THE INVESTIGATION AND
PROSECUTION OF CRIMES OVER WHICH THE TWO DEPARTMENTS HAVE CONCURRENT
JURISDICTION iu

‘Whereas, certain crimes committed by Coast Guard personnel subject to
the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be prosecuted by Coast Guard
tribunals under that Code or by civilian authorities in the Federal
Courts; and .
"Whereas, it is recognized that although the administration and discipline
of the Coast Guard requires that certain types of crimes committed by its
personnel be investigated by that service and prosecuted before Coast Uuaréd
military tribunals other types of crimes committed by such military per-—
sonnel should be investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted before
civil tribunals; and

"Whereas, it is recognized that it is not féasible to impose inflexible
rules to determine the respective responsibility of the civilian and Coast
Guard military authorities as to each crime over which they may have con-
current jurisdiction and that informal arrangements and agreements may be
necessary with respect to specific crimes or investigations; and

"Whereas, agreement between the Department of Justice and the Department

of Transportation (Coast Guaré ) as to the general areas in which they will
investigate and prosecute crimes to which both civil and military jurisdic-—
tion attach will, nevertheless, tend to make the investigation and prosecu-
tion of crimes more expeditious and efficient and give appropriate effect
to the policies of civil government and the requirements of the United
States Coast Guard;

or accessories, and, except in extraordinary cases, that there is no
victim other than persons who are subject to the Uniform Code of Mili-~

such a determination is made, the Coast Guard shall promptly advise the
Federal Bureau of Investigation of any crime committed on a military
installation if such crime is within the investigative authority of

conducted more efficiently and expeditiously by the Coast Guard. Bven
if the determination provided for in the first sentence of this para~

Bureau of Investigation of any crime committed on a military installa—
tion in which there is a victim who is not subject to the Uniform Code
of Military Justice or a bona fide dependent or member of the house—

and that the Coast Guard is investigating the crime because it has
been determined to be extraordinary, The Coast Guard shall promptly
advise the Federal Bureau of Investigation whenever the crime, except
in minor offenses, involves fraud against the government, misappropria—
tion, robbery, or theft of government property or funds, or is of a
similar nature, All such crimes shall be investigated by. the Coast
Guard unless it receives prompt advice that the Department of Justice

LIAISON WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

To insure adequate and effective liaison arrangements, each SAC should
specifically designate an Agent (or Agents) to be responsible for
developing and maintaining liaison with other Federal agencies. This
liaison should take into consideration FBI~agency community of interests,
location of agency headquarters, and the responsiveness of agency

representatives. In each instance, liaison contacts should be developed to

include a close friendly relationship, mutual understanding of FBI and

agency jurisdictions, and an indicated willingness by the agency representative
to coordinate activities and to discuss problems of mutual interest, Each
field office should determine those Federal agencies which are represented
locally and with which liaison should be conducted.

The various local military intelligence agencies,throughout the country
issue and disseminate domestic intelligence summaries on a regular periodic
basis which contain a review of security matters within the military area
where prepared, These summaries are compiled from research and analysis of
domestic intelligence information received from various sources including
data which was disseminated to these agencies by our various offices
located in the region covered by these military groups. In order to insure
that our information is being used properly and to make certain that any
data set forth in these summaries which could cause potential embarrassment
to the Bureau is called to the Bureau's attention, it is essential that
these summaries be promptly reviewed by the appropriate offices upon publication.
In making the review, particular attention should be paid to information
involving matters of nationwide newspaper controversy and that which is of
such a highly important nature that it is possible its improper use could
prove embarrassing to the Bureau. Any such information noted should be
promptly called to the Bureau's attention under the caption of the subject
matter .involved, together with observations and recommendations as to what
steps have been or should be taken to correct the situation.

C 1. Guidelines for investigative jurisdiction for FBI and Internal Revenue )
t Service (IRS)

if -In order to eliminate, where possible, a duplication of investigative

t effort and to insure a greater exchange of information between the

[ FBI and IRS, the Department has drawn up a set of guidelines regarding

t investigative jurisdiction of Federal gambling violations; namely,

iy the interstate transmission of wagering information, interstate transpor— ro
t tation in aid of racketeering, and interstate trans portation of wagering
C paraphernalia statutes. In the majority of cases that we investigate

[ under these statutes, IRS, from the nature of the wagering tax laws, will
if have an interest also. The following guidelines are to be utilized by ce
C both agencies in such instances. Each USA has been furnished a copy of
t these guidelines by the Department. :

"Guidelines Regarding Investigative Jurisdiction
of
Federal Gambling Violations

"In order to minimize any duplication in investigative effort between :
IRS and FBI field offices investigating potential violations of the ‘
wagering tax laws and the new anti-gambling legislation, the following :
guidelines appear appropriate. :

"(1) The FBI and the IRS will continue to exchange current information 7
regarding gambling operations which have come to the attention of each ?
agency.

"(2) Upon the receipt of sufficient basic facts to indicate a potential i
violation of the anti-gambling statutes or wagering tax laws, the FBI and i
the IRS will notify each other prior to commencing an investigation
involving such statutes within their respective jurisdictions, When the ina i
anvestigations involve a taxpayer who is a subject of interest to the , \
Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division, the i
responsible Department of Justice attorney will also be notified. —
i
j

"(3) If such notification reveals an apparent duplication of investigative
effort, appropriate representatives of the FBI and the IRS in the field
‘will meet to assign responsibility for the investigation involved to the
agency whose investigation has the best potential for prosecution, depending
upon the Federal statutes apparently involved and all the relevant inves-
tigative circumstances, Where it is deemed mutually desirable by the
agencies, preliminary investigation might be appropriately conducted prior
to any assignment of responsibility for the investigation to a single
agency.

"(4) In the event that the agency representatives cannot agree as to the
assignment of responsibility for a particular investigation, the matter
should be resolved after discussion with the responsible United States
Attorney or Department of Justice attorney.

"(5) Where statutory violations within the jurisdiction of the other

agency become apparent in the middle or later stages of an investigation

being conducted by either the IRS or the FBI, the agency conducting the rs
investigation will immediately ndétify the other agency of the relevant

facts. Responsibility for further investigation of the individual

violations of law will be determined after discussion between repre-
sentatives of the two agencies. If the agencies are unable to agree as

to the assignment of responsibility for further investigation, the matter
should be resolved after discussion with the responsible United States
Attorney or Department attorney. Depending on the circumstances, it~

may be preferable for such further investigation of all statutory vio-—

lations to be conducted by a single agency. In such event it is expected:

that the other agency would cooperate and render such assistance as is dD

‘The Bureau will continue to make available to IRS current information
of interest to that agency which is developed in the course of our
investigations.

With regard to item two of the guidelines as it pertains to notifying
IRS when there is indication of a potential violation of wagering
tax laws, such notification should be made after sufficient facts are
developed to determine the logical procedures to follow and at a time
when same would be more meaningful. With reference to investigations
involving a taxpayer, referred to in the same item, this pertains to
individuals whose names are included on a list of active gamblers
maintained by the Department's Criminal Division, Inasmuch as copies
of all reports involving the three statutes named above are furnished
the Department by the Bureau, such should tend to serve notice to the
Department that we are investigating an individual on that list. It
is anticipated that when the Department receives our reports and
checks its files it will thus be on notice that one of these individuals
is currently being investigated.

, Items three and four of the guidelines are self-explanatory in that
the USA should be consulted where there appears to be a duplication
of investigative effort and such cannot be resolved by field represent—
atives of both agencies. In connection with item five, regarding
the assignment of investigation to a single agency, responsibility for
an investigation should be definitely fixed in one agency insofar as
an individual violation is concerned. In this way each agency would
retain its own jurisdiction and the one whose case had the best
potential for prosecution would continue its investigation. Furthermore,
with.regard to one agency proceeding with an investigation and the
other rendering such assistance as is deemed within its competence
and capacity, the agency proceeding with its investigation should be
furnished with all pertinent information of assistance by the other
agency. This will preclude the necessity for any joint investigation
and result in each agency handling its own violation completely.

Each office should make every effort to avoid overlapping of jurisdiction
which these guidelines are intended to minimize. It is recognized

that at least preliminary investigation is necessary before any of

these mattérs can be logically discussed by both agencies. It is the

Bureau's feeling that the matter of jurisdiction in the majority of
instances can be resolved on a field level by the two agencies and
that the necessity for contacting the USA or Department attorney
would be rare.

The Bureau should be kept advised in advance of any matters in this
regard that are discussed with the USA, and also you should advise the

Bureau of any investigative action withheld through agreement with
IRS or on recommendation of the USA.]

SECTION 102. COORDINATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES
SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

"AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES
SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

["1. Purpose of Agreement

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) originates, and receives from
other sources, large numbers of reports on individuals and organizations.
One purpose of this agreement is to define that portion of the information
on file with, or received or originated by, the FBI, which the United States
Secret Service (USSS) desires to receive in connection with its protective
responsibilities.

"The USSS has statutory authority to protect, or to engage in certain
activities to protect, the President and certain other persons. (Certain
other persons, as used in this agreement, refers to those persons protected
by the Secret Service under Title 18, Us S. Code, Section 3056.) The
authority of the USSS to protect the President or certain other persons is
construed to authorize it to investigate organizations or individuals and to
interview individuals who might constitute a threat to the President or cer-
tain other persons. The FBI has statutory authority to investigate assault,
killing or kidnaping and attempts or conspiracies to kill or kidnap the
President and other designated individuals.

"The FBI will make available to the USSS information it may request or infor-
mation which by its nature reveals a definite or possible threat to the
safety of the President and certain other persons.

"A second purpose of this agreement is to insure the most effective pro-
tection for the President and certain other persons by establishing a clear
division of responsibility between the FBI and the USSS. Such division
will also avoid compromising investigations or sources and needless duplica-
tion of effort.

[ "Iz. General Responsibilities
| : "The USSS is charged by Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056, with the

esponsibility of protecting the person of the President of the United

States, the members of his immediate family, the President-elect, the Vice
President or other officer in the order of succession to the office of
President, and the Vice President-elect; protecting the person of a former
President and his wife during his lifetime and the person of a widow of a
former President until her death or remarriage, and minor children of a former
President until they reach 16 years of age, unless such protection is declined;
Protecting persons who are determined from time to time by the Secretary

of the Treasury, after consultation with the Advisory Committee, as being
major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who should receive such
protection (unless the candidate has declined such protection); protecting

the person of a visiting head of a foreign state or foreign government

and, at the direction of the President, other distinguished foreign visitors
to the United States and official representatives of the United States
performing special missions abroad (unless such persons decline protection).

SECTION 102. COORDINATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT acen@s 102G

"The Executive Protective Service, under the control of the Director,
USSS, is charged by Title 3, U. S. Code, Section 202, with protection of
the Executive Mansion and grounds in the District of Columbia; any building
in which Presidential offices are located; foreign diplomatic missions
located in the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia; and foreign
diplomatic missions located in such other areas in the United States, its
territories and possessions, as the President, on a case-by~case basis,
may direct.

"The FBI is charged under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751, with investiga~
tive jurisdiction over the assault, killing or kidnaping, and attempts or
conspiracies to assault, kill or kidnap the President of the United States
and other designated individuals.

“The FBI has responsibility for Federal investigations of all violations
of Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 112, 970, 1116-1117 and 1201, relating
to the 'Act for the Protection of Foreign Officials and Official Guests
in the United States.!

"The FBI has investigative jurisdiction over violations of a wide range of
the criminal statutes of the United States including primary jurisdiction
over matters affecting the internal security of the United States.

"III. Exchange of Information and Coordination of Responsibilities

"The USSS undertakes to identify individuals or groups who because of their
propensities or characteristics, may be dangerous to the President of the
United States and certain other persons. To assist the USSS in identifying
such individuals and groups the FBI agrees to furnish to the USSS, information
(other than public source information or information originating with other
U. S. agencies) from its files or which may come to its attention which by
its nature reveals a danger or possible danger to the President or certain
other persons, or which can be construed as falling within the categories of
information desired by the USSS as set forth in Section EV of this agreement.

"The FBI will inform the USSS of the identity of individuals or organizations
who come to the attention of the FBI as knowingly and willfully advocating,
abetting, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, or propriety of over-
throwing or destroying the Government of the United States, or the Govern-
ment of any state, territory, or possession, or political subdivision

therein, by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of

any such government. The FBI will furnish the USSS with reports on such
individuals or organizations as requested. During investigation by the FBI
of such individuals or organizations, the FBI will be alert and promptly
notify the USSS of any information indicating a possible plot against the
person of the President and certain other persons.

"The USSS agrees that it will conduct no investigation of individuals or
groups identified or suspected of being threats to the internal security of
the United States without notifying the FBI. However, when time for

consultation is not available, and an indication of immediate danger

exists, the USSS may take such action as is necessary with respect to carry-
ing out its protective responsibilities. Any information obtained by the
USSS during such action will be.furnished to the FBI as expeditiously as

possible.
"The FBI will not conduct investigation of individuals or groups solely

t for the purpose of establishing whether they constituté a threat to the
safety of the President and certain other persons unless there is an indica-
tion of a violation of Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751, or other

{ statute over which the FBI has jurisdiction.

{ "it will be the responsibility of the FBI to advise the USSS when investiga-

tion is being initiated under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751 and there~
after to furnish the USSS with copies of the FBI investigative reports as
} they are prepared. It will be the responsibility of the USSS to furnish

the FBI any information in its possession or which may come to its attention
which reasonably indicates that a violation of Title 18, U. S. Code,
Section 1751, has been or is being committed.

"The USSS also agrees to furnish the FBI any information in its possession
or which may come to its attention indicating a violation of any other
statutes over which the FBI has investigative jurisdiction.

"The FBI, under its responsibility for investigation of violations of

Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 112, 970, 1116-1117, 1201 and 1751 will take
cognizance of the protective responsibilities of the Treasury Department
under Title 3, U. S. Code, Section 202 and Title 18, U- S. Code, Section 3056
and thus does not limit or interfere with the authority of the Secretary of
the Treasury in the discharge of his statutory protective responsibilities.
This is not to be construed as vesting concurrent investigative jurisdiction
with the Treasury Department with respect to investigations of individuals
or organizations engaged in activities affecting the national security includ-
ing terrorism, treason, sabotage, espionage, counter-espionage, rebellion or
insurrection, sedition, seditious conspiracy, neutrality matters, Foreign
Agents Registration Act, or any other Statute or Executive Order relating to
national security. Any investigations of such groups or individuals for

any reasons other than in connection with protective responsibilities

must be closely coordinated with and have the concurrence of the FBI in

order to minimize interference with national security responsibilities of

the FBI.

Prosab is a coined word. for protection of Strategic Air Command bases and
intercontinental ballistic missile beses of U. S. Air Force.

A. DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMANTS

1.

After selection of a potential prosab informant and before contact, check
office indices, ascertain information concerning birth, background,

arrest record, loyalty, and reputation, When derogatory information
found, remaining file reviews should not be made and prospective in-
formant should be removed from list of potential informants.

No individual who has been convicted of a felony may be used as @ prosab
informant.

When a possible informant indicates his willingness to cooperate, explain
to him Bureau's jurisdiction over sabotage, espionage, and subversive
activities, including communist infiltration of labor unions. Make clear
to him that Bureau has no interest in relations between management and
employees or in union matters. Advise him specifically that he is not

a representative of Bureau; that his relationship with Bureau is strictly
confidential and should not be divulged to anyone.

Obtain prior Bureau authority before contacting any employee, professor,
or student of a university with a view to developing him as an informant,
Furnish Bureau person's name and position, as well as a statement concerning
his reliability and discretion.

Contacts with these individuals who are located on the actual campuses of
colleges and universities should be held to an absolute minimum, consistent
with Bureau's responsibility under Delimitations Agreement.

Where feasible and when considered to be to Bureau's advantage, prosab
informants should be advised of Bureau's exact interest and responsibility
in covering activities considered racial in nature. They should be made
thoroughly aware of Bureau's desire so as to avoid any possible misunder-
standing of our position and goal in racial field.

Be. POLICY

2.

lo.
ll.

Furnish no information to prosab informants concerning any of Bureau's
work, methods, or techniques.

Prior to developing any prosab informant as a security informant, obtain
Bureau approval.

When an informant has been developed, place a memorandum in file recording
background information concerning informant and specific instructions
which were issued to him. Informant's name should be indexed.

“An adequate number of informants must be developed to insure that Bureau's
“pesponsibilities with respect to espionage, sabotage, and subversive

activities are fulfilled.

No informants may be developed among civilian personnel of Air Force who
reside on air base or missile base. nes

Informants may be developed among civilian employees of Air Force who do
not reside on air base or missile base but who are employed on such bases.
With respect to missile bases, informants are to be developed only at those
bases and their auxiliary launching sites which are designated to fire

the ICBM.

Pursuant to an agreement with Air Force, informants should not be developed
among military personnel.

Bureau will furnish information received from Air Force from time to time
that Strategic Air Command and ICBM bases are to become operational at

some future date and that information will be furnished to interested field
offices. It is thereafter responsibility of each SAC to determine when
Strategic Air Command is actually operating a particular air base or an
ICBM base has become operational. Informants should then be promptly
developed.

Any possible payment to prosab informants will be governed by existing
regulations concerning payment of confidential informants,

Number of prosab informants developed in a particular base may be disclosed
to representatives of OSI; however, identities of these informants should
not be revealed.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissent-
nation outside your Conmittec. Its use ts limited to official proceedings by
your Committee and the content nay nut be disclosed to unauthorized person-
nel without the express approval of the FBI .

A file must be opened on each Strategic Air Command base and/or ICBM base
and maintained in a pending status. If there are any changes, a new file
should be opened as each new air base comes under control of Strategic
Air Command and when each new ICBM base becomes operational,

If an air base is removed from control of Strategic Air Command or missile
base is no longer considered operational or is not designated to fire the
ICBM, file may be closed after Bureau has been notified,

Memoranda recording contacts with air base and missile base commanders,
liaison officers, sources of information, and other prosab informants,

including both civilian employees and informants off the base, are to be
filed in file.

» PROSAB INFORMANT INDEX

A separate prosab informant index must be set up by each office having
air bases and missile bases handled under this program. Liaison officers
and sources of information may be included as prosab informants.

Record on informant cards changes in address or employment and post

6. chas

NW 54960

A semiannual letter must be submitted by each office having a Strategic

Air Command base and missile base in its territory.. This letter is to

be submitted on first of January and July of each year. This letter must

show following information for each Strategic Air Command base and missile

base:

a.» Name and address of each Strategic Air Command and missile base

b. Number of military personnel on base

©. Number of civilian personnel on base

a. Number of informants off base

e. Number of other prosab informants

£. Some ICBM bases may be located on Strategic Air Command bases and

: informants at air base may also be informants for missile base. In
such cases semiannual letter should advise whether informants are
listed separately for air base and missile base or whether informants
developed apply to both. :

g-' Data concerning a missile base to show information regarding number
and location of auxiliary launching sites associated with main control
station of missile base, Above information concerning number of
employees and informants should then be broken down for each auxiliary
launching site. If it is impractical to develop informants at missile
base or any of auxiliary launching sites, sufficient information to
justify not developing informants, together with identifying data
concerning specific missile base or auxiliary launching site, should
be submitted with semiannual letter.

Letter must specifically show that a11 informants have been recontacted

within preceding six months.

ad na for information concerning FBI projects
which included mail intercepts from 1958 to date

person cooperating with a hostile foreign power. Although
considerable volumes of envelopes were surveyed, the vast

majority of this mail was not further processed because it
aid not contain indicators which would make it relevant to
the survey.

(3 Of these surveys, one was ostablished in New York
ag a result of tho experience gained in the investigation
of a Soviet illegal. This illegal cooperated with the FBI;
and we learned that in directing mail to his Moscow center,
he addressed it in a specific fashion and also directed it
to mail drops in Europe. :

Ss ) From this experience, we were able to develop a
set of indicators which allowed us to select mail which we
felt was illegal agent mail, This, coupled with our knowledge
of known Soviet mail dyops on this side of the Iron Curtain,
permitted effective sercening of the mail and selection of
letters on a knowledgeable basis.

Gs) This method was proved successful when wo uncovered
three such illegals and successfully neutralized their
activities, This survey was conducted between 1959 and 1966.

bs A second survey was based on the use of these sane
indicators in examining incoming mail directed to certain areds
of New York City and other celtics in an effort to detect mail
being directed to illegal agents in the United States. This
survey was conducted between 1961 and 1962.

ts) A third survey was baséd on our knowledge that
illegal’ agents in the United States dirocted communications
to Soviet-bloc intelligence officers employed at the United
Nations in New York City. Again, this survey was based on
solid information that this meats of communication was
utilized by tho hostile intelligence service, This survey
was conducted between 1963 and 1966.

ts) A fourth survey was conducted in the Mianit, Florida,
area. It also utilised the known indicators and the known
nail drop addresses on mail being sent from tho United States
to Cuba. As an oxample, during the period of time this prorran
existed in Niami, from January 2, 1963, until July 21, 1966,
60 letters were determined to contain secret ink messages
either on the letter or on the envelope.

being sent to the United States from the People's Republic of
China and Hong Kong, as well as mail directed from the
United States to China, The coverage of mail fvom the

RE: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS RUREAU'S OPERATION
OF INFORMANTS

As indieated in this Bureau's sesponse ta Tten
Humber 1 above, Bureau informants ean generally be classified
into three categories: security, criminal ‘and oxtromist, In
an attempt to be responsive to Item Number 6, appropriate
supervisery poxsennel at FBI Headquarters, knowledgeable
concerning informant matters, were contacted in this recard,

Fersonnel handling security- and oxtromist-type
informants advise that they can recall instances in vhich FBI
informants operating in the seeurity and extremist fields
were arrested and/or convicted on the basis of eximinal
activity in no vay related to their informant status with
this Bureau, These personnel, however, have no vacollection
of this Bureau ever interceding for a security or extremist
informant in judicial proceedings, These personnel also
advise that it is established Bureau procedure that when a
Eureau security or extremist informant becomes involvad in
prosecutive matters as a result of eriminal activity, his
services as an informant are discontinued,

FBI Headquarters personnel handling e¢iminal
informants advise that this Bureau is currently operating
more than 18,000 informants in the criminal field. The
ovexvhelminy preponderance of these informants had been
arrested and/or convicted in local and/or Federal court at
one time or another on a wide variety of charges. This
Eureou has made known to a judge that a defendant convieted
in his couct has béen cooperative with the Government in
the past~-which may or may not be taken into account vhen
the judge passes sentence, This Burcau, hovover, makes a
point of notifying all informants at the time they ara
activated that this Bureau will not overlook criminal violations
on theie part or protect them in the event they become
subjects of criminal proceedings.

By letter 9/9/75 (copy attached), the House Select
Committee (HSC) requested that John J. McDermott, Assistant
Director, Files and Communications Division, afford members
of the HSC a briefing concerning "the files and classification
systems of the FBI."

by Department cover letter (copy attached), dated 9/15/75,
with the request that appropriate arrangements for this briefing
be effected,

Above communication was forwarded to this Bureau }

By phone call to HSC offices 9/16/75, SA Paul V.
Daly was able to ascertain that HSC Staff Member, Ellen Miller,
made the request and would be among those receiving the
briefing. Miller stated she expected the briefing to deal
. generally with the procedural aspects of mail processing,
indexing and filing.

OBSERVATIONS :
RUVINNTIESESIEATI REC: 102 G2-/leye
Since this request refers to a eee re! 4-98
the files and classification systems of this Bureau, it does
not appear that a release from Mr. McDermott's employment
agreement is necessary in this instance, Briefing such as
that described above would not involve classified pefofmation.

‘peebrmenparion: ‘ comers

ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE
MISCONDUCT’ BY FBI AGENTS
HOUSTON, TEXAS

By memorandum dated 1/7/75, Laurence H. Silberman,
Deputy Attorney General, advised that during the past year
FBI Agents in Houston, Texas, have engaged in an investigation
of alleged illegal electronic surveillance activity by the
‘Houston Police Department (HOPD). As an outgrowth of that
investigation, the Department has recently received informa~
tion alleging (1) that Bureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous
investigation of this matter; (2) that some Bureay Agents have
in the past, been aware of specific instances of illegal electronic
surveillances by the HOPD and have been receptive to information
derived therefrom; and (3) that the Houston Field Office may
itself have engaged in illegal surveillances.

Attached to Mr. Silberman's letter were copies of
transcripts of tape recorded telephone conversations between
Chief of Police Carol M, Lynn, ‘HOPD, and current and former
members of HOPD; a letter from Chief Lynn to U. S. Attorney
AUSA) J. P. Farris dated 12/13/74, and a memorandum to Chief
Lynn from B. G. Bond, Captain, Narcotics Division, dated 12/13/74.
Realizing that we might not have all of the material in the
Department's possession, Mr. Adams contacted Acting Assistant
Attorney General John Keeney on 1/16/75, at which time Keeney
made available copies of additional transcripts; a copy of a
letter dated 12/17/74, from USA Farris to Attorney General Saxbe;
copy of excerpts from. the transcript in U. S. v. Dudley clifford
Bell, Jr.; copy of a letter dated 11/20/73, from Carol Ss.

Vance, District Attorney, Harris County, Texas, to USA Farris;
and copies of five letters from AUSA Ronald J, Waska te SAC,
Houston, covering the period 4/3919/31/74. All of the ahove
Gocuments are attached.

Mr. Silkerman requested a memorandum detailing what
information the Bureau has on this matter. Attached for approval
is a proposed memorandum to Silberman setting forth the re
of our inquiry into this matter.

Memorandum,to Mr. Callahan
Re: ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE
MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

At the instructions of Mr. Callahan, Inspector
Willie C. Law and Inspector's Aide Ernest J. Landreville
proceeded to the Houston Office on 1/12/75. Immediately upon .
arrival at the Houston Office, SAC Robert Russ Franck was
telephonically contacted and thereafter appeared at the office
at which time he was advised as to the nature of our inquiry.

Houston files pertaining to one of the cases in . 5
question captioned "Jerry L. Slaughter; et al.; IOC" Houston
file 139-189, DBufile 139-4467, were thoroughly reviewed.
Following review of these files, personnel who might possess
knowledge of the allegations contained in Silberman's memorandum
and the attachments thereto, were interviewed. Each person
interviewed was furnished a memorandum prepared by the Inspector
which set forth the allegations and where pertinent, the
employee interviewed furnished a sworn, signed statement.

Following is a summary of the interviews conducted

- and the results of file reviews concerning each of the allega~

tions which could be construed as pertaining to the FBI as

contained in Mr. Silberman's memorandum and the attachments

thereto.

That Bureau Agents Have Eschewed A Vigorous Investigation Of This
‘Hatter

All personnel interviewed stated that Bureau Agents
have not eschewed a vigorous investigation in this matter. The
case Agent, Harlan Q. Coffman and Supervisor William J. Schmidt
feel that a vigorous and exhaustive investigation has been con-
ducted, The files pertaining to this case indicate that it was
opened on 12/7/73, based on a complaint that the voice of an
individual had been recorded on tape allegedly made from an
illegal wiretap by the Narcotics Division, HOPD. Investigation
was conducted and on 2/28/74, the case was closed because AUSA
Ronald J. Waska stated no evidence was available to support the
allegation.

The case was reopened on 3/8/74, based on a news
release hy UPI which was furnished -to the Houston Office by
the Bureau indicating that nine Mouston police officers had been
indicted by a Federal grand jury (FGJ) for various crimes,
including filing false tax returns and conspiracy to place
illegal wiretaps. AUSA Waska was contacted 3/11/74, and Y&ivised

no charges involving Interception of Communications had been made due
to Jack of proof, and evidence maintained in the USA's Cifice was found
solely in an affidavit of & whom Waska described as an
undercover informant. In April and October, 1974, Waska indicated there
was no need to interview CIUSI. On 3/11/74, Waska said he planned to
make the ([@M@patfidavit available to the case Agent within two weeks.
When this aifidavit was not forthcoming, the-case was closed on 4/1/74,
The affidavit was {finally made ayailable on 5/1/74 (approximately seven
weeks Jater) and indicates LEDS} was awaiting sentencing for making false
declarations to the FGJ.’ The case was reopened on 6/1/74. On the same
date, four reels of magnetic tape were received from Waska and in his
letter dated 4/29/74 he indicated that he had received two of these reels

” of {apa on ae and two reels of tave m 11/26/73 from the brother

ai He had previously indicated that the taves were
approxima aly t ten)years old and of no use in building a prosecutable
ease. 14 POR MART

The {= affidavit, which is dated 1/29/74 sets forth six
instances of allege wiretapoing by the ECED, Of these, the
Statute of Limitations had run ca all but two instances. GLB also
included in his affidavit that all logs and transcripts were destroyed and
the tapes were erased; thuS there was no physical evidence available.

There was no investigative activity in the case from 5/1 -
5/14/74, except one contact with AUSA Waska, Of the ten work days
during this period, the case Agent was on sick leave three days and
three “hours. Javestigation was conducted on various dates between
* 5/17 aud 6/7/74, and on the Istter date, AUSA Waska was aporised of
the investigation conducted up to that time. SA Coffman contacted vaska
on 6/27/74, at which time waska requested a list of employees of the
Communications Division of LKOPD. The Mst was obtained on 7/3/74
and is included in a five submitted by Sa Coffman on 7/69/74. Prior
SA Coifman contacted Waeka on
sation conducted to dste at which
tima a Wvaeas requested a report prior to rendering a prosecutive opinion.

There is no indication in the files of any outside investicative
activity between 7/26 and 9/26/74; however, in his report dated 10/22/74,
SA Coffman indicates a contact with Wasa on 0/23/74, at which time
Waska stated he had not had sufficient time to review Coffman's resort

tigation between 7/80 and 9/23/74, Waska, in a letter to the Houston
Office dated 10/31/74, stated he had never requested that this investiga-
tlon be delayed, but had requested an exhaustive and diligent investigation
since the inception of the.case, the only exception being that the FBI
should not interview Houston police officers under indictment. However,
during Coffman's contact with Waska on 9/23/74, the only investigation
requested by \aska was that Assistant District Attorney Robert C. Bennett
be interviewed. Bennett was interviewed on 10/8/74. During this inter-
view, Eennett advised that he and two cther attorneys from his cifice had
met with former SAC Thomas Jordan in Jordan's Cffice on 7/3/73,
regarding allegations of wiretapping by the HOPD but that he could furnish
no specifics at that time. : +,

On 10/23/74, SA Coffman contacted AUSA Waska regarding
any further investigation desired and Waska informed him that he desired
to review Coffman's 10/22/74 report first.

A substantial amount of investigation was conducted during
October and Noversber, 1974, and the latest report was submitted on

denied that he had advised Officer Bell that “UMMB was a thief.
He said he did inform Bell during the interview that he was aware
of detailed information concerning the Garza case; that he under-

Chief of Police C. M. Lynn's Letter to USA Parris Containing
Allegations or Inadequate Investigation By FBI to Determine If
Chief Lynn's Telephones and Those of His Staff Were Papped

Inquiry into this matter determined that a thorough
and comprehensive check of all telephone lines at all substaticns
was made. This check included tracing the conduit which con-
tained the lines and each appearance at various switching centers.
These checks were made by SAs Richard W. Suter and Donald C.
Steinmeyer with the assistance of televhone security personnel
and a telephone employee at each substation as they were checked,
A check of the lines commenced the same day the telephone numbers
were furnished — was concluded approximately ten days later,
with Chief Lynn's lines being the last to be checked. ‘There was
no indication of tampering or any illegal attachments on any of
the lines checked.

Sworn, signed statements concerning the above were
obtained from SAs Suter and Steinmeyer. SA Suter stated he was
particularly painstaking in these checks since he suspected that
equipment might be “planted” on the lines by J. L. Patterson, who
had advised Chief Lynn that his telephone line was "bugged."

During conference with USA Edward B, McDonough, Jr.,
and members of his staff on 1/17/75, he advised he was not
interested in discussing in detail allegations of misconduct by
Houston FBI Agents as contained in the transeripts and documents
furnished to the Department by former USA Farris. He considered
this an internal matter within the FBI which he felt would be
handled properly. His chief concern lay with the problem of
publicity because he had information that copies of the tapes

from which the transcripts were made were now in the hands of the local
news media; that he has been instructed by the Department to proceed via
the FGd route in this case; that some of the witnesses may be granted
immunity and that if indictments ave returned against veteran police
officers, their defense attorneys will use any means to obscure the real
issues, including publicizing the contents of the tapes. Hie foresees the
pasibility of FBI agents being subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.
He indicated that any allegation can be refuted, but the damage is already
done.

He said the way the 10C case eae to alleged illegal
electronic surveillance activity by the HOPD was handied was not
representative of the caliber of work he expected of the FBI. He felt
that the case should have received an imaginative rather than a routine
approach; for example, the Chief of Police was alerted and some time
later interviews were conducted with his personnel, thus allowing the
police to gt together and agree on what should be said when interviewed.
He also said he was not interested in obtaining a volume‘of FI’-302s
reflecting negative interviews. He was reminded that when knowledgeable

- individuals are interviewed regarding matters which could be selt-
incriminating quite often the results will be negative. Also, he did not
feel it was proper, as alleged, for an Agent to advise possible subjects
that the Statute of Limitations had run on many of the aliegations that
were the basis for the investigation. SA Coifman advised.that when
sitting in Captain Bond's Office, an officer asked what case the ailegations
davolved, and Coffman mentioned the Fanda and. Wimpy Week's case.

This officer asked what the Federal Statute of Limitations was and he was
told five years, This officer and other cificers said the case identified
was over five years old and the officers appeared to be happy about this.

McDonough stated at the present time all investigation has
been completed, but he expects the case to become very active aiter
testimony is taken before the FGJ (Convened 1/20/75). If this occurs,
he will require FIs] assistance so long as we are prepared to refute any
allegations should they arise either in court or in the press. Le was of
the opinion that the case should be assimed to personnel who have no
close contacts or personal association with members of LOD. Insnector

Division, to the effectthat an FBI Agent, "Swede Johnson" and another
Agent participated in and were receptive to information obtained from an

SA William ©, Johnson, Bank Robbery Coordinator of the

that to the best of his recollection, he has handled only one case wherein
. doe Singleton, a former office of HCPD, was involved and that this case
occurred several years ago. The case in question is captioned "William
Neil Lee - Fugitive; et al.; Colonial Savings Association, 10421 South

Re: ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE
MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

On 2/17/66 SA Johnson advised our Chicago Office and FBIHQ
via teletype that an HOPD surveillance had been established on the residence
of Lee's girl friend and that Lee had been in telephonic contact with her
twice and vas believed to be planning to meet her on 2/18/66, The Houston
Office copy of this teletype had the word “technical" typed in preceding
the word surveillance. The teletype was sent at 10:18 p.m., on 2/17/66.
SA Johnson stated that he personally typed the office copy of the teletype
and made certain corrections in ink. He also initialed the office copy for
forraer SAC Frank V. Hitt with his own initials underneath. It was noted
that the word “technicai’ had been lined through with a pencil and Johnson
has no idea who did this. He said it was SAC Hitt's policy to read or have
read to him all teletyres prior to their being sent; therefore, he assames
that either he or the night clerix read the teletype to Hitt dua to the time
the teletype was sent and the word “technical” was Hned through on Hitt's
orders. He said the lining through of the word "technical" would have
been logical since he had no first-hand knowledge that the information
came from a technical surveillance, but could have come from a police
informant. Ke stated as best he ean recall, he was furnished information
about the telephone calls orally by Captain Colley. During interview,

SA Johnson stated he typed the word “technical” on the teletype as it was
apparent to him that the information furnished pertained to telephone
conversations. On 2/18/66, after police showed Lee's photograph to an
apartment manager who advised Lee was residing in the building, Houston
police officers, one of whom was Lieutenant Joe Singleton, apprehended
Lee at 11:55 A.M. No FBI Agents participated in the arrest. Johnson
believes he was telephonically advised of the arrest and thereafter he and
Patty proceeded to the Police Department where Lee, who was in police
custody, was interviewed.

: Both Johnson and Patty denied ever being present at any location
at any time where an electronic surveillance was being conducted by per-
sonnel of the HGPD. SA Jolmson stated he sent the teletype on 2/17/66, not
lmowing whether the information furnished to hira by Captain Colley had come
from a police informant or a police technical surveillance. He included
information in his report dated 3/10/66, which stated that Captain Colley
had advised him on 2/18/66, that Lee was located and arrested through
surveillance and other investigation conducted by the EOPD.

Re: ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE
MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

SA Johnson was asked if he was aware that-a technical surveillance
by the HOPD could be a violation of the Federal Unlawful Publication or Use
of Communications Statute in force at that time, He replied that he was not
aware it was a violation inasmuch as he had no personal imowledge that the
information furnished to him by Captain Coiley had come from a technical
surveillance. There was no information developed during our inauiry that
any FBI personnel had any association with or personal knowledge of illegal
electronic surveillances. :

On 1/7/58 former Director Hoover issued instructions that there
was to be no investigation of any alleged violation of wiretapping laws until
the. FBI was directed to do so by the Criminal Division of the Department.
All SACs were advised on 1/8/58 to institute no investigation of any violation
of this type without prior Bureau approval. Similar instructions, in conjunction
with those of the FBI, were issued to all USAs by the Department. These
instructions were in force at the time of the alleged HOPD wiretap.

Inasmuch as SA Johnson received no complaint of illegal wiretapping,
and had no personal knowledge of such, his handling of the information in his
possession was appropriate.

That the Houston Field Office May Itself Have Engaged in Illegal Electronic
Surveillance

All personnel who would be in a position to have knowledge of such
activity denied that the Houston Field Office had engaged in illegal electronic
surveillance. The files of the Houston Office indicate that from 1964 to date,
two national security technical surveillances, one Title Ill surveillance, and
one Pen Register surveillance have been conducted, The national security ©
surveillances were authorized by the Bureau. The Pen Register and Title 1
surveillances were approved by Court Order. Another national security
surveillance was authorized by the Bureau and equipment was installed but
never activated because the subject was identified as an 88 fugitive.

In conference with USA McDonough, he was asied if-the basis for
the allegation in USA Farris' letter that the FBI was involved in illegal electronic
surveillance had emanated from a statement made in open Federal Court on
11/13/73, in the case entitled "Dudley Clifford Bell, Jr.; et al.; IOC" by
defense attorney Dick DeGuerin that "Larry Shaefer, who likewise is a witness

in this case, has sold electronic eavesdropping equipment to Don Steinmeyer,
an EBI Agent, who is also a witness in this case." McDonough said he
assumed this was what Farris was alluding to. McDonough had.said earlier
"how can we proceed with prosecution in the event indictments are returned
when the FBI may momentarily be accused or publicized as being or having
heen engaged in illegal wiretaps. *

McDonough was advised that DeGuerin's statement was completely
false; that former AUSA Joe Doucette, who was representing the Government,
knew it was false, but failed to refute it; and that AUSA Doucette was aware
that Larry Schaefer as a cooperating witness, had furnished items of evidence
to SA Steinmeyer relating to the manufacture and sale of electronic surveillance
equipment to Dudley Bell, Thia material was to be used as evicente at the
trial. It had been submitted to the FBI Laboratory for comparison with other
evidence in the case and reports setting ferth the resultg of the FEL Laboratory
examination had been furnished to the USA's Gffice. in addition, DeGuerin
and Dudley Bell had viewed this evidence in the Houston FBI Cffice prior to
the trial. All witnesses were excluded irom the courtroom except during the
time of their own testimony; therefore,. DeGuerin's statement stayed in the
record unchallenged. SA Stelnmeyer testified at the trial but the matter never
came up during his testimony. it was several months after the trial when 3A
Steinmeyer had hie firet opportunity to read the unrefuted statement made by
DeGuerin,

The above information was also available to former USA Farris
because copies of the reports and the transcript were available to him. When
asked on 1/17/75, why former AUSA Doucette did net refute the statement
of DeGuerin, USA MeDonough's only response was that some Federal judges
do not give Federal prosecutors the opportunity.

Additional information concerning this matter is contained in
administrative write-ups which were prepared as a reguilt of the inquiry
conducted both. at FIKQ and the Zouston Gifice. Recommendations relative
to any administrative action concerning epeescaee involved will be handled
separately.

QESERVATIONS: During this inquiry there were indications of a “vendetta’
between the UiA's Cffice and the RGPD. This may have had its roots when,
during the early days of the USA's inquiry into the alleged illegal wiretap si;
by the hCOPD, former AUSA James F. Faruer was forced to resign and stand

trial on charges of possession of narcotics. Parker is currently carried

.ag the victim of a pending Civil Rights investigation, Houston file 44-4504,

NW 54960

The basis of this investigation is that a convicted narcotics violator planted
marijuana and LSD in Parker's apartment in November, 1971, at the
direction of the Narcotics Squad, HOBD, in order to "make a “case” on
Parker.

Two other AUSAs, one ‘of whom was AUSA Waska, were accused
by narcotics officers of the HOPD of smoking marijuana at "pot" parties.
Administrative Inquiries into these accusations were conducted at the request
of the Department. AUSA Wassa vehemently denied ever using any narecctics.
Former AUSA Theo W. Pinson, Til, declined to discuss his personal life,

At about the same time these events were transpiring, former USA Farris
expressed concern that his and three of his assistants’ telephones had been
tapped by the Narcotics Bureau, HOPD.

results of our inquiry be approved and forwarded to Deputy Attorney General

possession of the FBI relative to the ailegations. Asa result, inquiries
have been conducted both at FBI Headquarters and our Houston Cifice to
resolve each allegation. It should be noted, that due to numerous gaps in
the transcripts furnished by former United States Attorney Farris, Southern

Edward B. McDonough, Jr., Southern District of Texas, who advised
that although he had in his possesion a complete transcript, the Depart-
ment had furnished the FBi only those portions he deemed to be significant.

The first allegation is that Bureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous

: - investigation of the alleced illegal electronic surveillance activity by the

Houston Police Department. In this connection, a thorough review has been
conducted of the case captioned, “Jerry L. Slaughter, also known as, et al, .
Yntercertion of Communications." Explanations and sworn statements have
been obtained from appropriate FBI personnel.

“This inquiry has failed to reveal anything which could be considered
substantial delay or iack of willingness on the part of FBI personnel to :

“pursue all logical investigative avenues available. United States Attorney

McDonough advised at the time of interview on January 17, 1975, that no -

the part of Eouston, Texas, FBI personnel. One of these alleges that some

'+ Yeceptive to information derived therefrom.

Cur inguiry. in Rouston disclosed that through the press the public

has been deluged with publicity concerning "bugging" activities by the Houston

* Police Department. Television stations are said to be in possession of tape
Fecordings made by Chief Lynn, as ke inquired into illegal wiretaps which
allegedly took piace under the aegis of his predecessor. The recorded
conversations were with present and former members of the Houston Folice
Department. Allegations of illegal wiretapping and other abuses of police powers
have been leveled chiefly at the Narecties and Criminal Intelligence Divisions
of the Houston Folice Department. Charges of information concerning personal
misconduct by Houston public officials has fanned the flames of publie curiosity
concerning police wiretapping. Inthe midst of the furor, a Federal Grand Jury
has been convened to gather information by the granting of immunity to witnesses,
relative to any illegal wiretapping conducted by the houston Police Department.

* Among ¢ the transericts of Chiat Lynn's conversations furnished tothe
FBI, are statements by Joe Singleton, former head of the Criminal intelligence
Division, Houston votice Lesartment, to the effect that an FDI Agent, "swede
Johnson," and another Agent participated in and were receptive to information
: cbtained from an illegal wiretap. :

Special Acent William O. Jchnson, Bank Robbery Coordinator of the
Houston, Toxas, FBI Cifice, was interviewed at lenath during our inquiry. He
_- stated that to the best of his recollection he had handled only on? case a number
of years ago that aiso involved Joe Singletea, a former officer of the Houston .
Police Department. ‘he case in question is captioned, "Wiliam Neil Lee - #ucitive,
Et Al. Colonial Savings Association, i0s2i South Post Oak Road, Houston, Texas,
Bank Robbery; itsMVv."

A review of the files revealed that Lee was identified on February 14,

- 1986, as ono of the individuals who robbed the above establishment on February 9,
' 1968. The FBI, Chicago, advised FBI, Houston, oa February i4, 1908, thata
Houston bank bag and 2 telegram acdressed to Lee at a Houston residence had
been recovered irom a stolen car found in Chicago. Lee's piotograph was
identified-by employees of two recently robsed bee banks as one of ths

bank robbers.

Speciel Agent Johnson was assigned the cases and was assisted by
Special Agent Joe P. Patty (new retired). The Houston Police Department
was also seexine Lee who was wanted for a number of local ronveries, Their
investigations were diracted by Captain L. C. Colley.

: On February 17, 19668, Srecial Acent Johnson advised FRI, Chicaso,
and FBI Headquarters via teletype that a Houston Police Department surveillance
had been established on the residence of Lee's girl friend and that Lee had been
in telephonic contact with ier and wag believed to be planning to meet her on
February 18, 1986. The Houston yBI Cifice copy of this teletype had the word
"technical" typed in preceding the word surveillance. “The teletype was senk
at 10:18 p.m., on february 17, 1956. Ssecial Agent Johnson siated that he
personally typed the office copy of the teletype and made cert2in corrections in

been lined throuch with a pencil and Johnson has no idea who did this. Ee said
it was Hilt's nolicy to read or have read to him ali seletypes prior to their being

came irom a technical surveiliance, but could bave come from a police intorm~-

cant, He stated as best he can recall, he was furnished information about the

telephone calls orally by Captain Colley. During interview Special Agent Johnson
stated he typed the word “technical on the teletyre as it was apparent to him that
the informa tion furnished pertained to telephone conversations, On February 18,
1988, after police showed Lee's photograph to an apartment manager who advised Lee

the teletype on Febeuary 17, 1966, not knowing whether the information furnished
to him by Captain Colisy had come from a police informant or a police technical
surveillance, He included information in his report dated March 10, 1985, which
stated that Captain Colley had advised him on February 18, 1966, that Lee was
located and arreated through surveillance aad other investigation conducted by the
Houston bolice epartment. : a

Special Agent dohuson was asked if he was aware that 2 technical
surveillance by the Houston Police Department could be a violatica of the Federal
Unlawful Publication or Use of Communivations Statute in force at that time. He
replied that he was not aware it was a violation inasmuch ag he had ne personal
tmowledge that the information furnished to him by Captain Colicy had come froma
technical surveillance. There was no information developed during our inquiry that
any FBI personnel hed any association with or persoaal mnowleage of ci
electronic surveiliances,

On January 7, 1958, former FBI Director J. Ldgar Hoover issued
instructions that there was to.be no investigation of aay alleged violation of
wiretapping laws until the FSI was directed to do se by the Criminal Divid on
of the iepartment. AL Special Agenis in Charge were advised on January 5
1958, te insiiinte no investigation of any violation of this type without prior
Bureau approval. Similar instructions in conjunction with those of the Bi
were issued to all United States Attorneys by the Department. Those inst ruc-
vie were in force at the time of the alleged Houston Police Department

Inasmuch as Special Agent Johason received no complaints of illegal
wiretapping and had no personal knowledge of such, his handling of the infor~-
mation in his possession was appropriate.

The final allegation mentioned in your commumication has to do with

- the possibility that the Houston FEI Office may itself have engaged in egal
electronic surveillance. From a review of the information furnished, dise
cussions with United States Attorney McC onoagh, and interviews of ¢Bi per-
sonnel, the only basis for such an allegation would appear to be containad in
statements made in open Federal court by Defense Attorney Dick DeGueria
:@2 November 13, 1973, in the casa castioned "Dudley Clifford Bell, dr.;
Lanny Goodman, Jr. ~ Victim; Et Al; Interceation of Communicatians.*
DeGuerin stated that “Larry Schaefer, who lixewisa is a witness for the Govern~

_ ment in this case, has sold electronic eavesdronping equipment te Don

Bleinmeyer, an FBI Agent, whe is also a witness in this case."

. This statement by DeGuerin is completely false. Former Assistant
United States Attorney Joe Deucaite, who was representing the Government
knew the statement was iaise but failed to reiute it. He was aware that Larry
Shaefer, ag 2 cooperating witness, had furnished items of evidence reizting to
. the manufactura and saie of electronic surveillance equipment to Dudiey Bell.
’ This material was to be evidence in the trial; It had been submitted to the
FBI Laboratory for comparisonmrposes. Laboratory reporis concerning if
hed been furnished to the United tates Attorney, to be introciuced in the trial,
and DeGuerin and Dudley Beli hed viewed this evidence prior to the trial, in
the Houston FBI Gilice. All witnesses were excluded from the trial except
during their own testimony and DeGuorin never breached the subject during
Special Agent Steinmeyer's testimony. it was several months after the trial
when Steinmeyer had his iirst opporiunity to read the transcript ccataining
the falacious unreiuied statement by teGuerin. Ali of the above information
was available to former United States Attorney Farris since copies of the
reports and court transcripis had beea iurnished to bim. Uniied States
Attorney McDonough was anorised of this in cur conierence on January i7,
1075, and was asked why L oucette did not refute DeGuerin's allezation.
MeDonough's only expianation was that some federal judges do not give
Federal prosecuiors the opporiunity.

An cther allegations of possible misconduct contained in the material
furnished by the Department, which could be construed as referring to the
FBI, have been thoroughly explored and no basis was found as io their validity.

The Deputy Attorney General : on

The FEI will continue every effort to assure that all investigation requested
by United States Attorney McDonough is handled expeditiously and in a thorough
manner.

On January 24, 1975, FBI Deputy Associate Director L B. Adams
was contacted by Jobn Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney Gereral of the Criminal
Division of the Department, who advised he had been in contact with United States
Aftterney McDonough who was under the impression that the Department was going to =
insist that FBI Agents from outside the Houston Division be utilized in conducting
the investigation concerning allegations of illegal wiretapping on the part of the
Houston Police Department. Mr. Keeney advised McDonough that such was not ia
the agreement and that the FBI was going to remain on the investigation utilizing
personnel of the FBI's choice. At that time Mr. Keeney was advised that we were
reassigning the case to an Agent who has no extensive contacts with the Houston
Police Department, the same practice we follow in Civil Rights investigations :
which would insure that we would be free from allegations cf bias in favor of the
police department. Mr. Keeney was assured that in the event additional’ i
personnel were needed in the Houston Field Division in order to aggressively
investigate these allegations the Bureau would send personnel from other FBI
Field Divisions but at that point we had not received any such request from the
Special Agent m Charge of the Houston Office. Mr. Reeney asked Mr. Adams
to contact the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Cffice to insure that he
was aware of the fact that if he needed additional personnel to investigate this
matter the Bureau would give him full support.

Shortly thereafter Mr. Adams contacted the Special Agent in Charge
of the Houston Cfifice who stated he had advised United States Attorney McDonough
that a Resident Agent in Galveston, Texas, was proceeding to Housten to assume
investigative responsibility for this case. Also, if necessary, he will bring
in additional Agents from Resident Agencies to assist ia the investigation.

On January 31, 1975, Mr. Xeeney contacted Mr. Adams stating that
United States Attorney McDonough still desires that FEI Agents from cutside the
Houston Division be assigned to investigate this case. Mr. Keeney informed
Mr. Adams that he did net concur with United States Attorney McDonough that
the FBI was alert to the problem in this case and in the event additional FBI personrl
were needed to investigate this matter, they would be made available. As previousiy
indicated the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Cfifice was directed to
personally supervise this case. On February 4, ade he advised that this
case is being personally supervised by him.

FBI Agents in Houston, Texas, have engaged in‘an investigation
of alleged illegal electronic surveillance activity by the
‘Houston Police Department (HOPD). As an owtgrowth of that
investigation, the Department has recently received informa~
tion alleging (1) that Bureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous
investigation of this matter; (2) that some Bureau Agents have
in the past, been aware of specific instances of illegal electronic
surveillances by the HOPD and have been receptive to information
derived therefrom; and (3) that the Houston Field office may

i At the instructions of Mr. Callahan, Inspector

| Willie C. Law and Inspector's Aide Ernest J. Landreville
proceeded to the Houston Office on 1/12/75. Immediately upon
i arrival at.the Houston Office, SAC Robert Russ Franck was
telephonically contacted and thereafter appeared at the office
at which time he was advised as to the nature of our inquiry.

Houston files pertaining to one of the cases in .
question captioned "Jerry L. Slaughter; et al.; Toc" Houston
file 139-189, Bufile 139-4467, were thoroughly reviewed.
Following review of these files, personnel who might possess
. knowledge of the allegations contained in Silberman's memorandum
| and the attachments thereto, were interviewed. Rach person
interviewed was furnished a memorandum prepared by the Inspector
which set forth the allegations and where pertinent, the
employee interviewed furnished a sworn, signed statement.

Following is a summary of the interviews conducted
and the results of file reviews concerning each of the allega~
tions which could be construed as pertaining to the FBI as
contained in Mr. Silberman's memorandum and the attachments
thereto.

That Bureau Agents Have Eschewed A Vigorous Investigation Of This
Matter

All personnel interviewed stated that Bureau Agents
have not eschewed a vigorous investigation in this matter. The
case Agent, Harlan Q. Coffman and Supervisor William J. Schmidt
feel that a vigorous and exhaustive investigation has been con-
ducted, The files pertaining to this case indicate that it was
opened on 12/7/73, based on a complaint that the voice of an
individual had been recorded on tape allegedly made from an
illegal wiretap by the Narcotics Division, HOPD. Investigation
was conducted and on 2/28/74, the case was closed because AUSA
Ronald J. Waska stated no evidence was available to support the
allegation.

The casa was reopened on 3/8/74, based on a news
release by UPI which was furnished to the Houston Office by
the Bureau indicating that nine Nouston police officers had been
indicted by a Federal grand jury (FGI) for various crimes,
including filing false tax returns and conspiracy to place
illegal wiretaps. AUSA Waska was contacted 3/11/74, and}&évised

no charges involving Interception of Communications had been made due
to lack of proof, and evidence maintained in the USA's Office was found
solely in an affidavit of MMMM whom Waska described as an
undercover informant. In April and October, 1974, Waska indicated there
was no need to interview(Chavez.| On 3/11/74, Waska said he planned to
make the Chavezjaffidavit available to the case Agent within two weeks.
When this affidavit was not forthcoming, the case was closed. on 4/1/74.
The affidavit was finally made available on 5/1/74 (@pproximately seven
weeks later) and indicates[Chavez|was awaiting sentencing for making false
declarations to the FGJ. ‘The case was reopened on 5/1/74. On the same
date, four reels of magnetic tape were received from Waska and in his
letter dated 4/29/74 he indicated that he had received two of these reels

of taps on 11/21/73 and two reels of tape m 11/26/73 from the brother
ot(@fichael Chavez) He had previously indicated that the tapes were
approximately ten years old and of no use in building a prosecutable

ease.

The (Chavegjatfidavit, which is dated 1/29/74 seta forth six
instances of alleged illegal wiretapping by the HOPD. Of these, the
Statute of Limitations had run on all but two instances. TaaieAalso
included in his affidavit that ali logs and transcripts were destroyed and
the tapes were erased; thus there was no physical evidence available.

There was no investigative activity in the case from 5/1 -

5/14/74, except one contact with AUSA Waska. Of the ten work days
during this pericd, the case Agent was on sick leave three days and
three hours. Investigation was conducted on various dates between
5/17 and 6/7/74, and on the latter date, AUSA Waska-was apprised of

. the investigation conducted up to that time. SA Coffman contacted Waska
on 6/27/74, at which time Wacka requested a list of employees of the
Coramunications Division of KOPD. The list was obtained on 7/3/74
and is included in a report submitted by Sa Coffman on 7/39/74. Prior
to the submission of this report, SA Coffman contacted Waska on
7/26/74 advising him of all investigation conducted to date at which
time vasa requested a report prior to rendering a prosecutive opinion.

Re: ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE
MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

There isn no indication in the files of any outside investigative
activity between 7/26 and 9/26/74; however, in his report dated 10/22/74,
SA Coffman indicates a contact with Waska on 9/23/74, at which time
Waska stated he had not had sufficient time to review Coffman's report
of 7/30/74, due to his burdened work load, and had not desired any inves-
tigation between 7/30 and 9/23/74, Waska, ina letter to the Houston
Office dated 10/31/74, stated he had never requested that this investiga~
tion be delayed, but had requested an exhaustive and diligent investigation:
since the inception of the case, the only exception being that the FBI
should not interview Houston police officers under indictment. However,
during Coffman's contact with Waska on 9/23/74, the only investigation
requested by Waska was that Assistant District Attorney Robert C. Bennett
be interviewed. Bennett was interviewed on 10/8/74. During this inter-
view, Bennett advised that he and two other attorneys from. his office had
met with former SAC Thomas Jordan in Jordan's Cfiice on 7/3/73,
regarding allegations of wiretapping by the HOPD but that he could furnish
no specifics at that time.

On 10/23/74, SA Coffman contacted AUSA Waska regarding
any further investigation desired and Waska informed him that he desired
te review Coffman's 10/22/74 report first.

A substantial amount of investigation was conducted during
October and November, 1974, and the latest report was submitted on
11/12/74. Since that time, the Houston Office has been serving subpoenas
on various individuals who are to appear before the FGJ, at the request
of the USA's Office.

Captain B. G. Bond's letter ¢ 12/12/74, to Chief Lynn eon

tains allegations that SA Coffman advised Cfficer T. A, Pall tha§hiix
(Chavez)was a thief, that SA Coffman told him he had quite a bit of infor

Chief of Police C. M. Lynn's Letter to USA Farris Containing
Allegations of Inadequate Investigation By FBI to Detexmine If
Chief fynn's Telephones and Those of His Staff Were Tapped

Inquiry into this matter determined that a thorough
and comprehensive check of all telephone lines at all substations
was made. This check. included tracing the conduit which con-
tained the lines and each appearance at various switching centers.
These checks were made by SAS Richard W. Suter and Donald C.

_ Steinmeyer with the assistance of telephone security personnel
and a telephone employee at each substation as they were checked,
A check of the lines cormenced the same day the telephone numbers
were furnished and was concluded approximately ten days later,
with Chief Lynn's lines being the last to be checked, There was
no indication of tampering or any illegal attachments on any of
the lines checked.

Sworn, signed statements concerning the above were
obtained from SAs Suter and Steinmeyer. SA Suter stated he was
particularly painstaking in these checks since he suspected that
equipment might be "planted" on the lines by J, L. Patterson, who
had advised Chief Lynn that his telephone line was “bugged.”

During conference with USA Edward B. McDonough, Jr.,
and members of his staff on 1/17/75, he advised he was not
interested in discussing in detail allegations of misconduct by
Houston FBI Agents as contained in the transcripts and documents
furnished to the Department by former USA Farris. He considered
this an internal matter within the FSI which he felt would be
handled properly. His chief concern lay with the problem of
publicity because he had information that copies of the tapes

from which the transcripts were made were now in the hands of the local
news media; that he has been instructed by the Department to proceed via
the FGJ route in this case; that some of the witnesses may be granted
immunity and that if indictments are returned against veteran police
officers, their defense attorneys will use any means to obscure the real
igsues, including publicizing the contents of the tapes. He foresees the
possibility of FBI agents being subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.
He indicated that any allegation can be refuted, but the damage is already
done. :

He said the way the IOC case pertaining to alleged illegal
electronic surveillance activity by the HOPD was handled was not
representative of the caliber of work he expecied of the FBI. He felt
that the case should have received an imaginative rather than a routine
approach; for example, the Chiei of Police was alerted and some time
later interviews were conducted with his personnel, thus allowing the
police to pt together and agree on what should be said when interviewed.
He also said he was not interested in obtaining a volume of FD-302s
reflecting negative interviews. He was reminded that when knowledgeable
individuals are interviewed regarding matters which could be seli-
incriminating quite often the results will be negative. Aiso, he did not
feel it was proper, as alleged, for an Agent to advise possible subjects
that the Statute of Limitations had run on many of the allegations that
were the basis for the investigation. SA Coffman advised that when
sitting in Captain Bond's Office, an officer asked what case the allegations
involved, and Coffman mentioned the Panda and Wimpy Week's case.

This officer asked what the Federal Statute of Limitations was and he was
told five years. This officer and other officers said the case identified
‘was over five years old and the officers appeared to be happy about this.

McDonough stated at the present time all investigation has
been completed, but he expects the case to become very active after
testimony is taken before the FQJ (Convened 1/20/75). If this occurs,
he will require FiI assistance so long as we are prepared to refute any
allegations should they arise either in court or in the press. le was of
the opinion that the case should be assimed to personnel who have no
close contacts or personal association with members of LGLD. Insuoctor
instructed LAC, Houston, to porsonally supervise this cise and to reassimn
it to a mature and thoroughly experienced Agent in keeping with the above;

and made certain corrections in ink. He also initialed the office copy for
former SAC Frank V. Hitt with his own initials underneath. It was noted
that the word "technical" had been lined through with a pencil and Johnson
has no idea who did this, Ue said it was SAC Hitt's policy to read or have
read to hira all teletypes prior to their being sent; therefore, he assumes
that either he or the night clerk read the teletype to Hitt due to the time
the teletype was sent and the word "technical" was lined through on Hitt's
orders. He said the lining through of the word "technical" would have
been logical since he had no first-hand knowledge that the information
came from a technical surveillance, but could have come from a police
informant. He stated as best he can recall, he was furnished information
about the telephone calis orally by Captain Colley. During interview,

_8A Johnson stated he typed the word "technical" on the teletype as it was
apparent to him that the information furnished pertained to telephone
conversations. On 2/18/06, after police showed Lee's photograph to an
apartment manager who advised Lee was residing in the building, Houston
police officers, one of whom was Lieutenant Joe Singleton, apprehended
Lee at 11:55 A.M, No FBI Agents participated in the arrest. Johnson
believes he was telephonically advised of the arrest and thereafter he and
Patty proceeded to the Police Gepartment where Lee, who was in police

. custody, was interviewed.

Both Johnson and Patty denied ever being present at any location
at any time where an electronic surveillance was being conducted by per-
sonnel of the HOPD. SA Johnson stated he sent the teletype on 2/17/66, not
kmowing whether the information furnished to him by Captain Colley had come
from a police informant or a police technical surveillance. He incluced
information in his report dated $/10/€6, which stated that Cantain Colley
had advised him on 2/18/66, that Lee was located and arrested through
surveillance and other investigation conducted by the EOPD,

Re; ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE
MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

SA Johnson was asked if he was aware that a technical surveillance
by the HOPD could be a violation of the Federal Unlawful Publication or Use
of Communications Statute in force at that time. He replied that he was not
aware it was a violation inasmuch as he had no personal knowledge that the
information furnished to him by Captain Colley had come from a technical
surveillance. There was no information developed during our inquiry that
any FBI personnel had any association with or personal knowledge of illegal
electronic surveillances.

On 1/7/58 former Director Hoover issued instructions that there ~
was to be no investigation of any alleged violation of wiretapping laws until
the FBI was directed to do so by the Criminal Division of the Department.
All SACs were advised on 1/8/58 to institute no investigation of any violation
of this type without prior Bureau approval. Similar instructions, in conjunction
with those of the FBI, were issued to all USAs by the Department. These
instructions were in force at the time of the alleged HOPD wiretap.

Inasmuch as SA Johnson received no complaint of illegal wiretapping,
and had no personal knowledge of such, his handling of the information i in his
possession was appropriate.

‘That the Houston Field Office May Itself Have Engaged in Illegal Electronic
Surveillance

All personnel who would be in a an to have knowledge of such
activity denied that the Houston Field Office had engaged in illegal electronic
surveillance. . The files of the Houston Cffice indicate that from 1964 to date,
two national security technical surveillances, one Title III surveillance, and
one Pen Register surveillance have been conducted. The national security
surveillances were authorized by the Bureau, The Pen Register and Title MT
surveillances were approved by Court Order. Another national security
surveillance was authorized by the Bureau and equipment was installed but
never activated because the subject was identified as an 88 fugitive.

In conference with USA McDonough, he was asked if the basis for
the allegation in USA Farris' letter that the FBI was invoived in illegal electronic
surveillance had emanated from a statement made in open Federal Court on
11/13/73, in the case entitled "Dudley Clifford Bell, Jr.; et al.; IOC" by
defense attorney Dick DeGuerin that "Larry Shaefer, who likewise is a witness

in this case, has sold electronic eavesdropping equipment to Don Steinmeyer,
an EBI Agent, who is also a witness in this ease.’ McDonough said he
asgumed this was what Farris was alludingte. MeDonough had said earlier
“how can we proceed with prosecution in the event indictments are returned
when the FBI nay momentarily be accused or publicized ag being or having
been engaged in illegal wiretaps. "-

feDonough was advised that DeGuerin's statement was compietely
false; that former AUSA Joe Doucette, who was representing the Government,
knew it was faise, but failed to refute it; and that AUSA Doucette was aware
that Larry Schaefer as a cooperating witness, had furnished items of evidence
to SA Steinmeyer relating to the manufacture and sale of electronic surveillance
equipment to Dudley Eell, This material was to be used as evidence at the
trial. It had been submitted to the FBI Laboratory for comparison with cther
evidence in the case and reports setting forth the results of the FEI-Laboratory
examination had been furnished to the USA's Office. in addition, DeGuerin
and Dudley Bell had viewed this evidence in the Houston FBI Cifice prior to
the trial. All witnesses were excluded from the courtroom except during the
time of their own testimony; therefore, DeGuerin's statement stayed in the
record unchallenged. SA Steinmeyer testified at the trial but the matter never
came up during his testimony. it was several months after the trial when SA
Steinmeyer had his first opportunity to read the unrefuted statement made by
DeGuerin,

The above information was also available to former USA Farris
because copies of the reports and the transcript were available to him. When
asked on 1/17/75, why former AUSA Doucette did not refute the statement
of DeGuerin, USA MeDonough's only response was that some Federal judges
do not give Federal prosecutors the opportunity. i

Additional information concerning this matter is contained in
administrative write-vps which were prepared as a result of the inquiry
conducted both at FBE.Q and the Eouston Office. Recommendations relative
to any administrative action concerning personnel involved will be handled
separately.

During this inquiry there were indications of a “vendel!

trial on charges of possession of narcotics. Parker is currently carried
as the victim of a pending Civil Rights investigation, Houston file 44-4504,
The basis of this investigation is that a convicted narcotics violator planted
marijuana and LSD in Parker's apartraent in November, 1971, at the
direction of the Narcotics Squad, HOPD, in order to "make a “case” on
Parker.

Two other AUSAs, one of whom was AUSA Waska, were accused
by narcotics officers of the HOPD of smoking marijuana at "pot" parties.
Administrative Inquiries into these accusations were conducted at the request
of the Department. AUSA Wasa vehemently. denied ever using any narcctics.
Former AUSA Theo W. Pinson, Il, declined to discuss his personal fife.

At about the same time these events were transpiring, former USA Farris
expressed concern that his and three of his assistants' telephones had been
tapped by the Narcotics Bureau, HOPD.

RECOMMENDATION: That the proposed memorandum setting forth the

results of our inquiry be approved and forwarded to Deputy Attorney General

This is in response to your memorandum dated January 7, -1975,
captioned as above, with attachments, requesting information in the

"have been conducted both at FBI Headquarters and our Houston Cffice to
resolve each allegation. It should be noted, that cue to numerous gaps in
the transcripts furnished by former United States Attorney Farris, Southern

Edward B. RicDonough, Jr., Southern District of Texas, who advised
that although he had in his possesion a compiste transcript, the Depart-
taem had furnished the FBI oniy those portions he deemed to be significant.

: The first allegation is that Bureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous
- investigation of the allesed illesal electronic surveillance activity by the
Houston Folice Department. inthis connection, a thorough review has been
conducted of the case captioned, "Jerry L. Slaughter, also known as, et al, .

This case was , opened in the Houston Office on December 7, 1973, by
former Svecial Agent in Charge Thorsas J. Jordan and assigned to Special Agent
Richard W. Suter based on a coniplaint made December 3, 1573, to Special
Agent Suter and Billy D. Hubbard, Security Supervisor, Southwestern Lell
Telephone Company, to the effect that Attorney Philip Greene had a tape recording
of Jack Storz's yoice allegedly made from an illegal wiretap by the Narcotics
Division of the Houston Police Department. On December 18, 1£73, the case was
Teassigned to Special Agent Harlan @. Coffman by Supervisor William J. Schmit

“and the case has been under Supervisor Schmidt's supervision and assigned to

Special Agent Coffman since that time. The case was reassigned from Special
Agent Suter who had annual leave scheduled in December, 1973, followed by a
commitment to attend a training school at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia,
early in January. This sheeriecaae was made to ae an; delay in
favestigation. Pee

Investigation was conducted regarding the original allegation and on
February 28, 1974, the case was closed after Assistant United States Attorney
Ronald J. Waska, Southern District of Texas, rendered an opinion that no
evidence was available to support the allegationg. >

The case was reopened by Supervisor Schmidt on March 8, 1974, and
assigned to Special Agent Coffman based on a United Press International news
release on February 28, 1274, furnished to the Houston Cifice byF5I Headquarters
which indicatea that nine ouston Police Department officers had been inuicted
by a Federal Grand Jury for various crimes including ccnspiracy to place iilegal

. wiretaps, stealing money and heroin from prisoners and narcotics traffickers,

selling stolen heroin and iiiing faise tax returns.

The case was discussed with Assistant United States Attorney Waska

aby Special Agent Cofiman on Mareh 11, 1874. Waska advised that-no charges

involving Interception of Conmiunications had been made due to lack of proof,
however, wiretapping was includea in charges against the defendants and the
evidence of this was in the possession of the United Siates Attorney's citice,
Southern District of Texas. This evidence consisted solely of an affidavit of
one(Michael Chavez, whom Wasa described as an undercover informant who
desired that his name not be made public. Waska said he planned to furnish

‘Chavez's piiidavit to the Houston FBI Cflice within two weess. -

This affidavit was taxen by Jaca C, Hollenshead, dr., Special Agent, Internal
Revenue Service, and witnessed by two other Internal Revenue Service «agents.

Dve to Waska'e delay in submitting the (Chavez\affidavit, the case was
placed in a closed status on April 1, 1974. It was reopened on May i, 1874,
and again assigned to Special Agent Coffman. in Wasxa's letter of April 23, 1974,
he stated that in the event investigation was not in progress he desired that a
comprehensive investigation commence immediately. 7

The (Chavez )affidavit on which the investigation was to be based, wags obtains:
at the Harris County|Jail where he was awaiting sentencing for making false state-
ments before a Federal Grand Jury. He had plead guilty to one count of a three
‘count indictment and furnished in his affidavit, a "portion" of his mowledge of

illegal wiretavs conducted by officers of the Narcotics Division, Houston Police
Department against alleged narcotics traificxers.

Along with the (Chavez iidavtt, Waska enclosed with his letter of
‘April 25, 1974, four reela of magnetic recording tane, two of which had been

. inhis custody since November 21, 173, and two since November 26, 1973. He
advised Special Agent Coffman that the tapes were approximately ten years old

and of no prosecutive value. ke requested that mane be maintained in the FBI
Oifice. :

Of the six different Houston Police Department cases mentioned by
having been made" with illegal wiretaps, the Federal Statute of
Limitations had run on four at the time Wasxa furnished the affidavit to the

erased according to the[Chavez)aifidavit.

: On May 14, 1974, Waska advised the original indictments had been
dismissed and new ones were being Sougnt.

With regard to this case, a situation prevailed in which: (1) the only
evidence was an ailidavit of[2 convicted purjurcrawaiting sentencing; (2) the
FBI was precluded from interviewing (cuaverfend any individuals unuer indictment;
and (3) other knowledgeable parties are or were veteran police officers who
could incriminate themselves by furnishing information,

Caral S. vance, District Attorasy, Harris County, Texas, in a letter
to United States Attorney Farris ca November 20, 1973, indicates that Carlos
Avila and Tony Zavala, two former Houston police officers under indictment
for conspiracy to seil marijuana, alleged through their attorneys that the
Narcotics Division, Houston Police Department, had engaged in ilezal electronic

’ surveillance. This letter states that Bob Bemneii, Oifice of the District Aitorney,
Harris County, Texas, brought these allegaticas to the attention ef former
Special Agent in Charse Tom Jordan. It is true that Eenneit and two of his
assistants did meet with Jordan and our inquiry indicates that Jordan asked
that specific facts be furnished and that he would have a secretary come in

“and record them. At that time Bennett ended the conversation and leit. Upon
interview with Phil Greene, one of the attorneys representing Avila and Zavala
he could furnish no speciiics of illegal wiretapping by the Housten Police Depart-
‘ment. He cifered to provide 2 witness ii the Federal Government would grant
the witess immunity. The resuits of this interview were furnished to tha -

United States Attorney's Office, Southern District of Texas, in a report dated
February 28, 1974.

Bennett was also interviewed at which time he cougenae he had discussed
ategations made by the attorneys for Avila and Zavala with Jordan. He said he
had no specifics at that time and was “taxing everything with a grain of salt”
due to his past relationships with these attorneys.

‘Ainong the transcripts of Chief Lynn's conversations furnished tothe
. FBI, are statements by Joe Singleton, former head of the Criminai Intelligence
Division, Houston votice Lesartment, to the efiect that an FBI Agent, "swede
Johnson,” and another Agent participated in and were receptive to informatien
” gbtained from an illegal wiretap. :

Special Acent William O. Johnson, Danis Robbery Coordinator of the
Houston, Toxas, FBI Cifice, was interviewed at length during cur inquiry. He
stated that to the best of his recollection he had handled only one casa a aumber
of years ago that aiso inyoived Joe Singleton, a former officer of the Houston
Police Repariment. The case in question is captioned, "Wiliam Neil Lee + rusitive,
Et Al. Colonial Savings Asseciation, 10424 South Pest Oak Road, Houston, Texas,
Bank Robbery; ilsMv."

: A review of the files revealed that Lee was identified on February 14,
1886, as one of the individuals who robbed the above establishment on February 9,
1986. The FBI, Chicago, advised FBI, Houstem, oa February 14, 1535, thata
Houston bank bag and a telegram addressed to Lee at a Houston residence nad
been recovered from a stolen car foumd in Chicago. Lea's pactograph was
identified-by employees of two recently robbed Houston banks as one of the
bank robbers.

Special Agent Johnson was assigned the casea and was assisted by
Special Agent Joe P. Patty (now retired). The Houston Police Department
was also seexing Lee who was wanted for a number of local ropveries. Their
investigations were directed by Captain L. C. Colley.

On February 17, 1986, Srocial Acent Johnson advised FBI, Chicaro,
and FBI Headquarters via teletype that a Houston Police Department surveillance
hed been established on the residence of Lee's irl friend and that Lea had been
in telephonic contact with Ler and was believed to be planning to meet her oa
February 18, 1985. The Houston #BI1 Office cooy of this teletyoe had the word
“technical” typed in preceding the word surveillance. ‘Tha teletype was sent
af 10:18 p.m., on February 17, 1985. Ssecial Agent Johnson stated that he
personally typed the office copy of the teletype and made certain corrections in
ink. He also initialed the cifice copy for former Special Agent in Charze Frank V.
Hitt with his own initials underneath. It was noted that the word “technical'' had
been lined through with a pencil and Johnson has no idea who did this. Le said
it was Hitt's nolicy to read or have read to him ali teletyges prior to their being
sent; therefore, he assumes that either hs or the aigat clerk read the teletype
to Hitt due to the time the teletype was sent and the word "technical" was lined
through on Hilt's orders. He said the ning through of the word "technicai” wouid

came from a technical surveillance, but could have come [rom a police inform~
‘ant, He stated as best he can recall, he was furnished information about the ~
telephone calls oraliy by Captain Colley. During interview Special Agent Johnson
stated he typed the word “technicai" on the teletype as it was apparent to him that
the informa tion furnished pertained ta telephone conversations. On February 18,
1996, after police showed Lee's protograph to an apartment manager who advised Lee
was residing in the pullcing, Boustoa police officers, one of whom was Lioutenant
doe Singleton, apprehended Les at 1:55 A.hi. No FBI Agents participated in the
arrest, Johnson believes he was telephonically advieed of the arrest and thereafter
he and Paity preceeded ts the Police Department where Lee, who was in police
: custody, was interviewed,

Both Johnson and Patty denied ever listening to, » Farticinpating in or being
present at any location at any ime where an electronic surveillance was being
conducted by the Houston Police Department. Special Agent Johnson stated he sent
the teletype on February 17, 1968, not knowing-whether the information furnished
to hire by Captain Colley had come from a police informant or a police technical
surveillance, He included information in his report dated March 10, 1966, which

- stated that Capiain Colley had advised him on February 18, 1066, that Lee was
located and arrested through surveillance and other investigation conducted by the
Houston Police Lepartment, 7

Special Agent Johuson was asked if he was aware that a technical
surveillance by the Houston Police Department could be a violation of the Federal
Unlawful Publication or Use of Communications statute in force at that time. He
replied that he was not aware it was a violation inasmuch as be bad no personal
knowledge that the information furnished to him by Captain Colley had come from a
technical surveillance. here was no information developed during our inquiry that
any FBI personnel had any association with or personal knowledge of illegal
electronic surveillances,

: Sa January 7, 1958, former FBI Director J. Ldgar Hoover issued tt
instructions that there was to be no investigation of any alleged violation of z
wiretapping iaws until the FSI was directed to do so by the Critainal Divid on

’ of the Lepartment. All Special Agents in Charge were advised on January 8,
1958, to institute ao investigation of any violation of this type without prior
Bureau approval. Similar instructions in conjunction with those of the rBI
were issued to all United States Attorneys by the Department. These lustruc-
seca were in force at the time of the alleged Houston Police sea cite
wiretap,

the Deputy Attorney General

Inasmuch as Special Agent Johason received no complaints of illegal
wiretapping and had no personal knowledge.of such, his handling of the infor-.
mation in his possession was appropriate.

The final allegation mentioned In your communication has to do with

. the possibility that the Houston ¥B1 Cifice may itself have engaged in illegal
electronic surveillance, From a review of the information furnished, dis-
cussions with United States Attorney McConcugh, and interviews of #61 per-
sonnel, the only basis for such an allegation would appear to be contained in
statements made in open Federal court by Defense Attorney Dick LeGuerin
:0a November 13, 1973, in the case cantioned "Dudley Clifford Bell, dr.;
Lanny Goodman, dr. « Victim; Et Als Intercestion of Communications."
DeGuerin stated that “Larry Shaefer, who lixewisa is a witness for the Gevern-

ment in this case, has sold electronic eavesdropping equipment to Dea‘
Steinmeyer, an FBI Agent, who ig also a witness in this case.”

: This statement by DeGuerin is completely false. Former Assistant

United States Attorney Joa Doucette, who was representing the Government
knew the statement was false but failed to refute it. He was aware that Larry
Shaefer, as 2 cooperating witness, had fernished items of evidence reiating to

_ the manufactura and saie of electronic surveillance equipment io Dudley Bell.

” This material was io be evidence in the trial, It had been submitted to tha
FEI Laboratory for comparisenmrposes. Laboratory reports concerning it
hed been furnished to the United States Attorney, to be introcuced in the trial,
and DeGuerin and Dudley Beli had viewed this evidence prior to the trial, in
the Houston FB1 Gifice. AL wimesses were excluded from the trial except
during their own testimony and DeGuerin never broached the subject during
Special Agent Steinmeyer's testimeny. it was several months after the trial
when Steinmeyer had his iirst opportunity to read the traascript containing
the falacious unreiuted statement by LeGuerin. Ali of the above information
was available to former Uniied States Attorney Farris since copies of the
reports and court transcripts had beéa furnished to him. United States
Attorney hicDonough was aporised of this in our conierence on January 17,
1975, and was asxed why LC ouceite did not refute LeGuerin's allenation.
MeDoncagh'a only expianation was that some Federal judges do not sails

. Federal prosecutors the opporiunity.

All other allegations of possible misconduct contained in the Peal

furnished by the Department, which could be construed as referring to the
FBI, have been thoroughly explored and no basis was aes as to their validity.

‘The Deputy Attorney General ; saeesanauaee

The FBI will continue every effort to assure that all investigation requested = -
by United States Attorney McDonough is handled expeditiously and in a thorough
manner, ans :

On January 24, 1975, FBI Deputy Associate Director J. B. Adams
was contacted by John Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal
Division of the Department, who advised he had been in contact with United States F
Attorney McDonough who was under the impression that the Department was going to .:
insist that FBI Agents from outside the Houston Division be utilized in conducting
the investigation concerning allegations of illegal wiretapping on the part of the
Houston Police Department. Mr. Keeney advised McDonough that such wag not q
the agreement and that the FBI was going to remain on the investigation utilizing
personnel of the FEI's choice. At that time Mr.- Keeney was advised that we were
reassigning the case to an Agent who has no extensive contacts with the Rouston
Police Department, the same practice we follow in Civil Rights investigations
which would insure that we would be irce from allegations of bias in favor of the
police department. Mr. Keeney was assured that in the event additional
personnel were needed in the Houston Field Division in order to aggressively
investigate these allegations the Bureau would send personnel from other FEI
Field Divisions but at that point we had not received any such request from the
Special Agent n Charge of the Houston Office. Mr. Keeney asked Mr. Adams
to contact the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Cffice to insure that he
was aware of the fact that if he needed additional personnel to investigate this
matter the Bureau would give him full support.

Shortly thereafter Mr. Adams contacted the Special Agent in Charge
of the Houston Cffice who stated he had advised United States Attorney McDonough
that a Resident Agent in Galveston, Texas, was proceeding to Houston to assume
investigative responsibility for this case. Also, if necessary, he will bring
in additional Agents from Resident Agencies to assist in the investigation.

On January 31, 1975, Mr. Keeney contacted Mr. Adams stating that

United States Attorney McDonough still desires that FEI Agents from outside the

Houston Division be assigned to investigate this case. Mr. Neeney informed

Mr. Adams that he did net concur with United States Attorney McDonough that

the FBI was alert to the problem in this case and in the event additional FBI personrel
| Were needed to investigate this matter, they would be nade available. As previously
| indicated the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Cffice was directed to

personally supervise this case. On February 4, 1975, he advised that this

case is being personally supervised hy him. ~-

SUBJECT: House Select Committee Letter dated September 25

With reference to the request of the House Select
Committee for the name of the person whose name was ex-
cised from COINTELPRO documents 100-448006-171,255, the
HSC has advised that it has no objection to the FBI con-
tacting the person to determine whether the person ob-
jects to his name being provided to the HSC. If the:
person has no objection, the name will be provided. You
will recall that this is the same proposal as was ear- é _
lier offered to the SSC. The HSC has agreed to this 7
approach on a trial basis in an attempt to avoid a con~
frontation with the Department on this issue.

appear for an interview at 10:00 a.m. on September 26, 1975, the
* subject of which was not specified.

Mr. Tait was advised that should the subject of the interview
concern FBI purchases of equipment from his company relating to Bureau }

needs pursuant to Title I, we would have no objection to him discussing f, ‘s
such matters with Committee representatives. However, should the inquiry
concern other matters, it would be appropriate for him to suggest to the 7“
Committeé representatives that their inquiry should be addressed to the. “
Bureau. I furnished him my name and telephone number as a point of

contact in the event he desired to raise any questions during the course

of the interview.

U. 5, HOUSE SELECT COMMITING ON INTELLIGHUCE ACTIVITIES (asc)

RE: REQUEST FOR ENFORMATION CONCERNING IDENTITY AND PAYLENTS
TO FBI INFORMANTS AS WELL AS TAX RECORDS FILED REGARDING
SUCH PAYMENTS

and as pertinent information pertaining to all such deductions
became available, this Bureau vould submit to Internal, Revenue
Service (IRS) a coded list of informants with tax deductions
withheld for each, along with a bank check made out te IRS

for the total amount withheld. At no tima did this Bureau
€fle any individual tax returns for informants, .

Tt should be noted that because IRS records are
nov? computerized, making it impossible for IRS to provide
proper security for continuance of the abeve procedure, and
to effect, for this Bureau, a considerable monetary savings
in clerical and Agent salaries required to maintain extensive
records in this regard, this Bureau, effective August 19, 1975,
discontinued the practice of withholding tax deductions made
from informant payments,

In response to request Number 2 above, there are
enclosed tax reports filed by this Burequ vith the IRS
reflecting tax deductions made from informant payments
covering the calendar years 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973, A
similar report for the tax year 1974 is cerrently being
prepared at FBI Headquarters and upon completion will be
similarly submitted to the IRS,

By letter dated 8/27/75, we received x request for
the interviews of four Agents by the House Select Committee.
Some of the Agents who were requested to be made available for
testimony are defendants in a civil proceeding arising out of
a Bureau investigation. Simultaneous with this request, by
letter dated 8/27/75 from the House Select Committee, we also
received a request for material pertaining to the investigation
out of which the aforementioned civil action arose. . Upon re-
ceipt of this request, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division ex-
pressed his concern to Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel
for Intelligence Coordination in the Department, and his Deputy,
Steven Blackhurst, pointing out that ‘the avenue of inquiry by Ceaee
the House Select Committee could have an adverse impact on the °. 7)
pending civil litigation and that’ careful consideration should
be given as to the Department's and Bureau's response to these
requests. He was also advised that the Agents themselves were
being sued in both an individual and official capacity; and,
of. course, an adverse judicial finding could financially affect
the Agents. involved.

At the Department's request on 9/9/75, SA Daly attended
a meeting in the Department with Sally Whittaker of the Civil
Division, Jim Reynolds of the Criminal Division, Michael E.
Shaheen, Jr., and Steven Blackhurst to. discuss the House Select
Committee requests concerning the aforementioned matter. Both
Whittaker who was handling the civil litigation involving Bureau
personnel in the. Bureau and Reynolds who is in the process of
presenting to a Federal Grand Jury a criminal violation con-
nected to the law suit stated they felt that the Committee's
requests would not have an adverse impact on either of these
matters. Reynolds did request that certain material be with-
held from the Committee which he had intended to use as re-
buttal material in the event the criminal matter went to trial.

RE: . HOUSTUDY

SA Daly expressed concern at the request for interview by the
House Select Committee and stated it would appear in the in-
terests of the Department and the Government that if such
interviews were allowed, the Department furnish the Agents
legal representation. The Department agreed that they would
provide legal representation to the Agents if they were in-
terviewed by the House Select Committee.

Subsequently, a meeting was held on the same date
with Richard Vermeire and Tim Oliphant, House Select Committee
Staff Members, and they agreed orally to special procedures
concerning this particular matter_relating to the production
and handling of documents. They indicated that they would
have to secure approval from their superiors and would con-
firm their approval in writing. As of 9/10/75, the Committee
has not furnished the Department a written agreement pertaining
to their requests.
