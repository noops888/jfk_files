a. & Mago” ROBRENO,) According to(ROBRENO'S) father_p¢
who ig presently living Ii exile in New York City” G1 MAGOP
is presently living in Madrid at Gension HISPANA, Ave. pj
Jose Antonio 44, Plaza del.Callaajj telephone No, not known.
4/1 will go Madrid to s EL MAGOJon MIIAPRON rams, and then
take him to Paris for a“eW days, if he is willing. (EL
MAGQ)should be useful for gleaning information from the
Embassy types while in Paris.)

b. Jewelry Deal. According to ANWHIP/1, there have
not been any transactions since the initial ones of 300,000
and 10,500 in June 64, He had expected to receive a packet
of jewelry per month worth ca. 9 00 dollars. A/1 also
wrote some time ago (June 64) t&(QUySNAFU/19, but has not re- .
ceived an answer to date. , It is not known at this time
whether the lack of further jewelry packets is just poor
administrative procedures oa the part of the Cubans, or
whether perhaps 4/1 is suspect for some reason by the Cubans,
This should be resolved when next A/1 meets sienbifis.

c. FAL Equipment 6 A/l stated that he felt one of the
first things (EL 1 WAGOfwould ask him was about the FAL equip-
ment which AMLASH/1 Was requested, A/I was told that the
silencer for the FAL did not exist and that it probably was
not feasible to attempt to adapt a make-shift one, according
to weapon authorities, The matter of a telescopic sight was

zwlPd

not discussed, A/1 was told that spegial equipment for a
rifle such as the, FAL was difficult td procure as the
weapon ¥as designed primarily as a general-purpose combat
weapon, not for special tasks. ‘A/1 then asked about the
lity oF purchasing a special weapon in Europe and
xico fake it back with fim, He was told that such
es Corobapiy for hunting big game) were un~
doubtedly available in Europe, but that this did not solve
the biggest preblem of how to get it into AMLASH/1.
was told that such a gun or any_part of it would undoubted-
ly be highly suspect if (aa MAGO) tgted to bring any such
items into Cuba, It is @ppare' Qohowever, that this topic
will continue to be one of concern to all persons connected
Xith the AMLASH/1 operation until it is resolved, Perhaps
the best bet would be to level with AMLASH/1 at the next
meeting and tell him that such equipsent will not be forth~
coming from KUBARK or ODYOKE sources, together ‘with the

reasons why not.

a. “requisition of Cuban Pesos. A/1 stated that he had
called (Ricardo syson in ‘adelphia several times
(confirmed by telecons earlier between undersigned and A/L
{conga York) but that in each case, the son had stated that
he had received no packages from his father from Mexico
during the latter's last time in that city. A/1 thought
one indeed strange. The undersigned opined that perhaps
feas difficult to obtain pesos today due to the stringent
gurrency controls now in force in Cuba, Ke su gested to
SiwHip/i that he not pursue this problem with RDOJfurther,
as any over-zealous efforts on his part to obtain the%
ae rrency might come, to the attention of the Cubap authorities.
Of course, if(BORDO}does produce the pesos at # later date
(with no addi fiona} prompting from A/1), they will be readily
accepted. 06

time Congie Vindentina Antypa wasthe mistress for many

£. Raymundo TORRES . TORRES called
A/1 from Wexico With a message from ANLASH/1 for

y

A/1 (see below), At that time, TORRES out from Cuba on

a trip, was staying at the Hotel Guardiola, Ave, Madero

and San Juan de Letran, phone 218580, Later he aoved to -

Hornes 74, Apt 304, Mexico, D.F. A/1 stated that TORRES

all right and apparently was trusted enough by AMLASH/1

seaneeed ; to deliver an inocuous message and letter, the latter being
not so’harmless. A/1 stated that TORRES was given to
drinking and tock dope upon oceasion, (No identifiable
traces on TORRES).

g. ANLASH/1, LASH sent A/1 the accompanying letter.
mailed by TORRES from Mexico, The text is self-explanatory.
: Tt has been decided that there would be too much room for
Pee suspicion if KUBARK tried to have LASH invited to the cited
Setional assembly of Surgeons, A/1 has an acquaintance
with one Manuel RODRIGUEZ, who was in 1959 a medical student
Mad President of the Noxican F.E,U. He suggested that if
hevcould locate RODRIGUEZ, he might be able to have him
formally invite ANLASH to the Assembly, as the latter desires.
A/1 has not seen RODRIGUEZ (on whom there are no identi-
fiable traces) for about three years: but believes that
there is no risk in attenipting to locate him and asking this
favor, It is perhaps worth the effort, although admittedly
itis a long shot, It should be noted that RODRIGUEZ 's
father 4s believed to be a communist, but that, according
to A/1, RODRIGUEZ is not. (This would adually not be a
problem, providing RODRIGUEZ believed that he was just doing
Ptavor for A/1 who desires to see hig, old friend Lasy.)

came to the attention of the undersigned. A/1 will be contacted
