not discussed.

All was told that special equipment for a

rifle

such as

the FAL was difficult to procure as the

weapon was designed primarily

as a general-purpose combat

weapon, not for special tasks.

A/l then asked about the

possibility of purchasing a

special weapon in Europe and

He was told that such

special rifles (probably for hunting big game) were un-

doubtedly available in Europe, but that this did not solve

the biggest problem of how to get it into AMLASH/1.

called (Ricardo BONDO'S) son in Philladelphia several times

(confirmed by telecons earlier between undersigned and A/

in New York) but that in each case, the son had stated that

he had received no packages from bis father from lexico

during the latter's last time in that city.

A/1 thought

this indeed strange.

The undersigned opined that perhaps

it was difficult to

obtain pesos today due to the stringent

currency controls now in force in Cuba.

We suggested to

A/l has not seen RODRIGUEZ (on whom there are no identi

there is no risk in attempting to locate him and asking this

favor.

It is perhaps

worth the effort, although admittedly

it is a long shot.

It should be noted
