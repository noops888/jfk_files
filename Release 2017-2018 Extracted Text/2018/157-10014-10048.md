Senator Schweiker, In dealing with the Cuban Intelligence
Service, weren't some of these people bound to be included in
some of these Cuban exile groups?

Mr. Swenson. Let me put it this way. I did not monitor
yroups as such.

Senator Schweiker, Right.

Mr. Swenson. 1 did monitor individuals so that if a
name which had any relationship with the perations of Cuban
intelligence surfaced, I would look into that very closely

counterintelligence standpoint, I usually would interview him
myself. I would interview him at great length. some of these
were, let's say, people who were singletons. ‘They were not

The only group I can think of offhand was the AMCANOE

Senator Schweiker. What was that?

Mr. Swenson. AMCANOE. It was a eryptonym. I don't know
it by any other name.

Senator Schweiker. Well, it would seem to me, and maybe
it is a matter of functional definition, that your Cuban
exiles group would be a fertile field for any intelligence
activity. This is where both the pro- and anti~Castro agents
were operating, where all of your activities would primarily

Senator Schweiker. In other words, on Cuban intelligence

agents, per se, is that what you're telling me?

Mr. Swenson, Yes. If they were Cuban intelligence
agents, that was my jurisdiction.

Senator Schweiker, But what i'm getting ar is wouldnt:
a number of these be working undercover in the anti-~Castro
exile groups? That would certainly be the logical cover tha:

Mr. Swenson, Senator, ; was very alert to this. Thas
was part of my job, so this was why 4 would have all of tho

plug leaks where I suspected them.

Senator Schweiker. Did we have substantial leaks or
leaks, or how would you describe the kind of information fiow:

Mr, Swenson. Lt is very hard to say how substantial the

leaks were.

killed on landing. This was of great concern to me.

My role in this was simply the protective measure, to try
te determine who might be involved, and insofar as people in th
United States were concerned who were Suspected of being
Cuban intelligence agents, I woula discuss that with sam Papich
because I felt that the Bureau had a jurisdiction within the
continental United States,

Senator Schweiker. As part of your role, would you ever

infiltrate an american agent to act as a double agent to find

prepared a rather elaborate system of identification of people

so that people who had clearances were welcome to look at that

at that. They need not have talked to me.

preferred not to discuss it anymore with me.

Senator Schweiker. What was the basis of your disapproval?
I mean, why did you disagree?

Mc. Swenson. Well, I didn't think it was a sensible
operation, Senator. “I felt first that we were dealing with
people whose kona fides were subject to question, whose

professionalism was subject to question, and I felt that if they

had succeeded in killing Castro, that he might have been succeed.
by his brother, for example, who would be worse. So I thought
it was a pointless operation. I thought it was a iot of
nonsense.

Mr. Johnston. Was that true?
Mr. Swenson. I dont know whether it was true or not
I would say that the number of operations that were being

conducted in Spain again were not secure from a counterintelli-

gence standpoint. I thought that they were rather sloppy, and
1 indicated that.

Mr. Johnston. One of your memoranda that you wrate after

the Espinoza meeting states -- and all I have are my notes fre
it -- the AMLASH circle is wide, and each new friend of whom
we earn seems to have knowledge of the plan. I believe the
problem is a more serious and basic one. Fidel reportedly k
in 1962 that the group was plotting against him and enlisted
its support. Hence we cannot rule out the possibility of
provocation.

Do you recall that memorandum?

Mr. Swenson. This is tree, and this is what 2 testif

have said repeatedly, and in my debriefings of people, the

simply continued to oppose such ventures. I thought they were

Meant provocation more than just reciprocating with propagande,

Mr. Swenson. Well, I would have considered any type of
retaliatory measure by Castro, and this was the purpose of the
dissemination of such material to other government agencies
which had jurisdiction, such as the FBI and the Secret Service

Mr. Johnston. iet me ask you, isa't it obvious that
CIA was plotting to assassinate Castro and he became aware o:
it, that he might retaliate, especially when he had warned ais

for the AMLASH operation?

Mr. Swenson. Weil, ‘your using the term investigation is
what is puzzling me here. What I did is a constant function,
was to look for any activities on the part of opposition
services which would threaten the United States or people in thd
United States, United States security. This was a continuing
function, There was no particular investigation except as
part of what I did all the time. The AMLASH group was of
concer: to me because I thought they were sloppy, but [ never
did find out from all of the many interviews I conducted, and
the research I did, and that of everybody on my staff, that
there was ever any attempt on the part of the Cubans to

assassinate the President.

A, the fact that he granted an interview; and B, the fact that

Mr. Swenson. Mr. Castro is a very bold, imaginative
person who is capable of doing anything. Does it have some
special significance relating to the Kennedy assassination?

i don't see any.

Mr. Epstein. Tne suggestion has been made that he chose

the Brazilian consulate because that was his method of g

a message, if the operation had been compromised, that he i

learned of the meeting that nad happened in Brazil in Sep.
of 1963. ‘The suggestion has been made that that is the way
he was yetting the message to the United states.

Mr. Epstein. In retrospect, now, is that an issue that is

considerable by counterintelligence people, and does it

trigger any kind of thoughts in your own head when you hear

it now? :

Mr, Swenson. Wah, ‘you see theré are so.many ‘things that
were going on all over Latin-America with regard to Cuban
activities in the different countries, ‘I would go to
Brazil, for example, or, for example, of seeing people who
had been connected with Cuban intelligence, and. debriefing them
and so on, and I would not read that Castro's visit to the
Brazilian installation had anything to do with the Kennedy --
had anything to do with a whole host of things.

Mr. Epstein, No. The issue is whether his visit to the
Brazilian consulate would have had anything to do with --

Mx. Epstein. Getting our attention, and indeed, the
veracity of his assertion, thar he had learned of plots --

Mr. Swenson, Well, we received a great deal of information,

sympathetic to Cuba. I was not interested in a positive
operation, by funetion, unless there was a Cuban intelligence
connection, unless there was a way that I could use that to

of a vacuum cleaner approach. My approach was stricthy --

service, or protection of our own resources.

people, who tried to persuade me to stay, and I said i was
not interested in staying.

There were no specifics that were raised in those discus-
