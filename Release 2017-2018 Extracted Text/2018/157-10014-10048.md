and I continued with the task force, which later became known

as SAS, up to 1965, within the United States as Chief of

Counterintelligence. My first job was Assistant to the

Director of the Task Force for the crisis in Cuba, the missile

crisis. I then became Chief of Counterintelligence.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall exactly when you became Chief

of Counterintelligence?

MI. Swenson. I really can't.

Mr. Johnston, Can you recall the month that you left?

MI. Swenson. Well, let me say that when I was assigned

abroad I continued to have a relationship with

that staft. M

was during a period of

assignment in Ecrope, so I really

continued in a way to have a relationship with the Staff unti!

an investigation into the Assassination?

MI. Swenson. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall who was in charge of that

investigation?

Mr. Swenson. No, I do not.

I assume it would have been the CI Staff.

Mr. Johnston.

Speaking

of the C1 Stuff, wao was in

Mr. Swenson. Jin Angleton.

Mr. Johnston. And what was your

responsibility to Mr.

Mr. Swenson. Well, there was a common interest in

counterintelligence matters, and if southing came up which

required consultation, I would consult with that staff.

Me. Johnston. What was the size of the Counterintelligence

Staff within SAS?

Mr. Swenson. I suppose I had perhaps 30 people.

Mr. Johnston. At headguarters, is that correct?

Mr. Swenson. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Going back now to the assassination of

President Kennedy, were you aware of the fact that a special

investigation was initiated shortly after the assassination sha

was not located in Mr Angleton's bailiwick?

No. Swenson. I knew that there was a special investiga.

but I had nothing to do with it.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know Mr. Jack Whitten, or

Mr. Swenson. Yes, I knew him.

hard for me to place before and after, his name appeared as

having paid a visit to a Cuban or Soviet embassy in Mexico

City, and that's about the only knowledge that I had.

Mr. Johnston. And you have a recollection of knowing that

before the assassination?

MI. Swenson. Now, I cannot remember that it was before.

This is what I am unsure about.

Mr. Johnston. All right.

Mr. Swenson. Normally a great deal of information went

past the desk. I delegated screening

of voluminous materials

which came in to various people who worked for me, and they

would call to my attention thinys which appeared significant

and then I would look into those. But really, as far

as the

assassination of President Kennody is concerned, I an afraid

I don't have anything to contribute. I don't know anything

which didn't appear in the press, really.

Senator Schweiker. You were

never

asked to concuct any

investigation separately or specially or apart from that --

Mr. Swenson. No, Senator. The only request which was

levied on me with reguid to the assassination, as 1 can recail.

was to find whether the FBi hud given to my staff any informa:

which was relevant, and i caused a scaren of our

records to li

the full extent of it.

Mr. Johnston. Had that information been passed on to the

CI Staff prior to the assassination?

Mr. Swenson.

Yes.

Mr. Johnston, The routing on it, which I assume we are

talking about the same thing, was the report of FBI agent

Kaak on Oswald's activities in New Orleans.

Mr. Swenson. That was probably it, yes. As I say, I have

a very vague recollection of it.

Mr. Johnston. And that routing sheet on that meno indicams

it went to the CI Staff on November 22nd.

Is it your recollection that it went there before the

assassination?

Mx. Swenson. I really can't recall. I am sorry. All i

know is that McCone wanted to know had anything come in, I

caused a search to be made. Normally Sam Papich, who was the

Bureau liaison officer who came to my office every working

day, would

see one of the people working for me, now deceased,

Austin Horn, and we would vass to the burcau any information

which appeared pertinent to the Bureau purposes, and we woul

receive from the

Bureau anything which they considered appro

priate for us.

so that che menorandum, as I recall, which came in, i ta

on in due course.

MI. Swenson. Directly, none.

Mr. Johnston. Did you advise either Mr. Whitten or MI.

Angleton about Cuban angles to it?

Mr. Swenson. Well, we … you know, I was very conscious

of all of the activities of Cuban intelligence.

Probably

I was better informed than any other one individual about

Cuban intelligence activities, and I knew and know of nothing

which made a contribution as far as the assassination was

concerned.

MI. Johnston. Were you consulted, though, by Mr. Anglecon

or Mr. Whitten?

Mr. Swenson.

No, I can't recall that I ever was, bur

I would have discussed anything probably with Des Fitzgerald.

As I say, I can't recall any specific discussion because I

had nothing to offer.

Senator Schweiker. Did you ever pass on any informia.

relating to plots to assassinate Castro?

Mr. Swenson. Absolutely not, no.

Senator Schweiker. Or anyone else?

Mr. Swenson. By no one.

Mr. Johnston. What discussions did you have with Mr.

Fitzgerald about the Kennedy assassination, and especially abort

your expertise on Cuban matters?

Mr. Swenson, To the best of my knowledge, there was

never any discussion with bes about Cuba, participation in a

plot against President Kennedy's life because it never appeared

pertinent.

MI. Johnston. Let me ask you why you don't feel

it was

pertinent, and let us just take as a basis for that question

tact that Oswald was associated with the FPCO, and

I might add that I did talk to many people, Cubans, who

embassy in Cuba, it was known at the time through the intelligence

agencies that he was with Kostikov, who was also known to be

Cuban Intelligence Service. I did not deal with the Cuban

groups. That fell within other jurisdictions.

Senator Schweiker. In dealing with the Cuban Intelligence

Service, weren't some of these people bound to be included in

some of these Cuban exile groups?

Mr. Swenson. Let me put it this way. I did not monitor

groups as such.

Senator Schweiker.

Right.

Mr. Swenson, I did monitor individuals so that if a

nane which had any relationship with the perations of Cuban

intelligence surfaced, I would look into that very closely.

I cannot recall a single name that surfaced which related to

the Kennedy assassination or

I felt that there was some reason to be concerned from a

counterintelligence standpoint, I usually would interview him

myself. I would interview him at great length. Some of these:

were, let's say, people who were singletons. They were not

associated with any group.

The only group I can think of offhand was the AMCANOE

group which I was concerned about, the penetration --

Senator Schweiker. What was that?

Mr. Swenson. AMCANOE. It was a cryptonym. I don't kno:

it by any other name.

Senator Schweiker. Well,

it would seem to me, and mayhe

it is a matter of functional definition, that your Cuban

exiles group would be a fertile field for any intelligence

activity. This is where both the pro- and anti-Castro agents

were operating, where all of your activities would primarily

be, wouldn't they?

Mi. Swenson. Hot mine, no, Senator.

Senator Schweiker. In dealing with counterintelligence.

wouldn't you have to be dealing with peosle who would have a

other measures.

Senator Schweiket. During your tenure as Chief of CI, were

you ever alarmed or concerned about leaks from our side to

theirs and was part of your job to plug these leaks?

Mr. Swenson. Yes, I was concerned and took measures to

plug leaks where I suspected them.

Schweiker. Did we have substantial leaks or normal

leaks, or how would you describe the kind of information fist:

back to Castro?

Mo. Swenson, It is very hara to say how substantial the

leaks were.

My role in this was simply the protective measure, to try

to determine who might be involved, and ingofar as people in the

United States were concerned who were suspected of being

Cuban intelligence agents, I would discuss that with Sam Papich

because I felt that the Bureau had a jurisdiction within the

Mr. Swenson. However, let me go a step further. I

prepared a rather elaborate system of identification of people

connected with Cuban intelligence service. This was computerized

so that people who had clearances were welcome to look at that

list for any connections. So this group, like Jack Whitten's

at that. They need not have talked to me.

Mr. Johnston. Let me ask you whether in November of

Mr. Swenson. Yes, I remember that.

Mr. Johnston. Was that true?

MI. Swenson. I dontt know whether it was true or not.

I would say that the number of operations that were being

conducted in Spain again were not secure from a counterintelli-

gence standpoint. I thought that they were rather sloppy, ani

I indicated that.

Mr. Johnston. One of your memoranda that you wrote after

the Espinoza meeting states . and all I have are my notes fron

it -- the AMLASH

circle is wide, and each new friend of whol

we learn seems to have knowledge of the plan.

I believe the

problem is a more serious and basic one. Fidel reportedly kaveri

in 1962. that the groun was plotting against him and enlisted

its support. Hence

we cannot rule out the possibility of

provocation.

to turn their knowledge ofnwhat we were doing to their purposes,

if only for propaganda purposes.

I. felt.from the outset the whole thing was nonsense, as I

have said repeatedly, and in my debriefings of people, the

more I learned, the more insecure it appeared to me, so I

simply continued to oppose such ventures. I thought they were

silly.

Senator Schweiker. Knowing Fidel Castro's personality and

temperament, and on the assumption that you were right, that he

had some knowledge of these ouerations which you feared, ouvio: s

ly, from the record of what you said, wouldn't you possibly have

meant provocation more than just reciprocating with propagande,

knowing his personality?

MI. Swenson, Well, I would have considered any type of

retaliatory measure by Castro, and this was the purpose of the

dissemination of such material to other government agencies

which had jurisdiction, such as the FBl and the Secret Service.

Nr. Johnston. Let

determine whether the Cuban government had retaliated specifically

for the AMLASA operation?

what is puzzling me here. What I did is a constant function,

was to look for any activities on the part of opposition

services which would threaten the United States or people in tha

United States, United States security. This was a continuing

function.

as

Mr. Johnston. I'm not asking you at this point -

Mr. Swanson. I don't remember:

Mr. Johnston. I'm not asking. you at this point whether you

explored it. I'm just asking you whether you drew a possibility

of a connection in your mind?

Mr. Swenson.

I probably would have. I don't have any

specific recollection of it.

Mr. Johnston. Do you now draw the possibility of a

connection?

Mr. Swenson. As a possibility, yes, but all of my

eiforts over a long period of time which were say exhaustive

and extensive, both,

failed to produce any connection.

I wouls

be mindful at all times of such possibilities in everythiny

that I did, and I interrogated many people, I interviewed many

people. I read reports from many sources.

I never found ever:

a thread of a connection.

Mr, Johnston, Well, let me ask you as

specific fact

whether you knew

that on November 22nd an aircraft flight

in Mexico City, a Cubana aircraft flight from Mexico City su

Havana was detained from about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon

uncil 10:00 o'clock in

the evening awaiting a passenger who

arrived in a twin-enyined

aircraft, who bypassed Custons an

who rode in the pilot's cabin on the flight to Havana?

Mi. Swenson. They do not, Senator.

Mr. Wallach. I am sorry I had

asked. just let me know.

It is my understanding that you were aware generally

of the AMLASH operation and the purpose of the operation in 1963.

Mr. Swenson. Generally and specifically both, I would so!

Mx. Wallach. You were aware that there was

a meeting

set up with AMLASH in Brazil in September of 1963 or thereabouts?

Mr. Swenson.

I cannot recall. I would have known

probably that there was such a meeting to be held. I was

on record as considering tiat this was a dangerous

and

stupid operation.

Mr. Wallach. The meetiny in Brazii with AMLASH was --

can you give me that?

Mr. Johnston. Septenber Sth, or early Septenber.

Mr. Swenson, I cannot remomber the exact dates. It was

the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Fidel Castro goes down to the

Brazilian consulate in Havana and makes a speech or grants an

Interview to Dandel Harker, the AP reporter, and specifically

uses the worda "eliminate" 1

Mr. Swenson, I believe this has already been covered.

Mr. Wallach, I know Jim did raise that but what I'm

asking you is whether or not in your counterintelligence

background and your knowledge of Castro whether or not Castro's

A, the fact that he granted

an interview; and B, the fact that

he apparently went to the Brazilian consulate, which I

understand that he did not frequent very often, has any

significance?

I an asking this to you as an expert.

Mx. Swenson. Mr. Castro is a very bold, imaginative

person who is capable of doing anything. Does it have some

special significance relating to the Kennedy assassination?

I don't see any.

Mr. Epstein. The suggescion has been made that he chose

the Brazilian consulate because that was his method of gebtar:

message, if the operation had been compromised, that he hud

learned of the meeting that had happened

in Brazil in Septe..u:

of

The suygestion has been

made that that is the war

Mr. Epstein. In retrospect, now, is that an issue that is

considerable by counterintelligence people, and does it

trigger any kind of thoughts in your own head when you hear

it now?

Mr. Swenson.

Well, you see there are so many things that

were going on all over Latin America with regard to Cuban

activities in the different countries, 'I would go to

Brazil, for example, or, for example, of seeing people who

had been connected with Cuban intelligence, and debriefing them

and so on, and I would not read that Castro's visit to the

Brazilian installation had

anything to do wich the Kennedy --

had anything to do with a whole host of things.

Mr. Epstein. No. The issue is whether his visit to the

Brazilian consulate would have had anything to do with --

Mr. Swenson, With getting our attention --

Mi. Epstein. Getting our attention, and indeed, the

veracity of his assertion, that he had learned of plots --

Mr. Swenson. I would not attribute that special signiti-

done it.

Mr. Swenson. I'm sorry. Normally they would have put

down my own group here, SAS/CI. This apparently did not reach

me for some reason.

Senator Schweiker. What does that SAS up there mean?

Mr. Swenson. Well, the SAS referred to the task forcu,

really, Special Affairs Staff. They changed the name of ti

task force. And then the slash was to separate

it

from some

component, and I think that the EOB - they changed names --

I think that the OB had to do with a staff which was trying

to engage in positive intelligence operations against Cuba,

things like AMCANOE and AMLASIl, but I really can't tell you

the exact destination, but you'll note that it'did not conc

Mr. Johnston, Let me correct for the record. Initially

they have identified - they thought he was the same as

Gilberto Lopez who was in los Angeles. Subsequently they found

it was not true.

Mt. Wallach. Who did you deal with at the Bureau? Did

you deal with Papich or did you deal with someone directly?

Mr. Swenson. Usually Papich stopped in my office every

day, every working day.

Mr. Wallach. Did you have any direct contacts with

anyone at the Bureau in the Donestic Intelligence section?

Mr. Swenson. I think someone else came over

Mr. Swenson.

Well, we received a great deal of information,

Senator, from the Bureau about people like this who might be

sympathetic to Cuba. I was not interested in a positive

operation, by function, unless there was a Cuban intelligence

connection, unless there was a way that I could use that to

penetrate the Cuban intelligence service. Other staffs were

interested in it for other purposes, for debriefing them, for

positive intelligence, and anything that could be gleaned, sor:

of a vacuum cleaner approach. My approach was strictly --

Senator SChweiker. Penetration.

Ms. Swenson. Penetration of the Cuban intelligence

service, of protection of our own resources.

So I did not get involved in that.

Now, had one of those individuals had a meeting with a

known Cuban intelligence officer, then I vould have

seen

concerned

and

would have become invoived.

Mr. Swenson. P'i have a vague recollection of it, but only

a vague recollection.

Senator Schweiker. Do you recall what form it took or

just how it was done?

Mr. Swenson, Well, my best recollection was that he wanted

to be sure that no one had been remiss, and he wanted to take

a look at the scope of the operation before, and whether it

should be maintained at the same level and things of this

nature. I was not directly involved. My own staff's function

was clearcut, and up until the time I left, continued in the

same form.

Senator Schweiker, Was this done through written report

to

the Director, or how was this done?

Mr. Swenson. I customarily -- this is a management

procedure in my own staff - kept track of how we were doiny,

what we spent, what we needed, and how effective we were,

and I don't recall any special effort at that time to give

more than I had already dore. I think they could nave taken

ME. Swenson. Well, I would raise any cables which had

a counterintelligence importance, and which I considered

should be discussed with other people, you know. If we had

staff meetings all day long, we wouldn't get anything done.

Mr. Wallach, Was Helms ever present at any of these

staff meetings?

Mr. Swenson. No.

Mr. Epstein. Did there ever reach a point in time when

you received an indication from debriefing intelligence officer

or in any other way that specifically the AMLASH assassination

plot against Castro had been compromised?

Mr. Swenson. No. I can't recall any specific.

Mr. Epstein. Do you recall any discussion surrounding

the Castro speech at the Brazilian consulate relating to tho

question of whether sone CIA operation had been compromisea

and that that is

what Castro was referring to?

Mi. swenson. I con't recall and i have no specific

recollection of that, no.

Id'I had no specific recollection.

But I would assume

now that' that might have been mentioned.

Mr. Epstein. Was there any specific investigative

responsibility or counterintelligence responsibility levied

or divided or

assigned at those meetings with respect to

determining whether or not the Cuban government was involved

in the assassination?

Mr. Swenson. I can't recall any specific sequirement that

was levied on me for example, but it really wasn't necessary.

I mean, it was an obvious thing which I would look for to

see if there was anything. This was part of my ongoing

responsibility, and I never found any relationship.

Mr. Epstein.

Was

an instruction issued to the wAVE

station to determine that issue?

Mr. Swenson.

Possibly. I have no recollection. Possibiy

it was.

MI. Epstein. What I'm getting at here is the question

of whether or not that is

a logical issue

to arise

in debriesi

and a logical issue

to be handled by the counterintelligence

veopie it it comes up in the cuurse of i contact with a soured

or an asset as distinguished from specific instructions

contact all known

sources,

informants, assets, and operations

to determine any and all inforation bearim

on that issue.

Mr. Swenson, I simply cannot recall anyching specific e

it was never discussed with me, and to the best of my knowleüge,

underworld contacts had occurred prior to the Kennedy assassi-
