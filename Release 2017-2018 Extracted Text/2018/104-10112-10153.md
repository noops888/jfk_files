at the convenience of Headquarters. This could be easily arranged here
in the event an LCFLUITER team is passing, or could pass, through Habana;
on the other hand, VAIVADA could just as easily go to any designated place
in Florida in order to take this test. It is understood that LCFLUTTER
teams from time to time visit that state.

activities of Subject and his wife while in Habana.

projected one-year tour of duty will end in June, 1958, at which time it

mitted to Headquarters; it is referred to here so that the Headquarters desk
may be alerted to the need for considering what assignments would be
open to VAIVADA during the Spring or Summer of 1958.
