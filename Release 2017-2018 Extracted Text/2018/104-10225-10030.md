MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTI2 (PLANS)

SUBJECT: RFE in Turkey
‘

ACTION NECESSARY: Wi11 you please decide or cause to be decided the

following questior Should ‘the Wxtional Comittee for a Free Europ:
i eI in its aperéach to Turkish autnorities exploring the pozzibility of
: creatinz an RFE station in Turzey contact Turkish. avtirities aa a

: non-governmefital private Committee or as.a CIA-financed ‘nstitution?

Backeround

d . 1, The State Devartment hae asked that RFE not.aporeach Turkish
authorities until VOA's attemt.to get into Turkey has been accepted
or refused by the Turks, Tne Benartment has now given the Voice of
America watil-15 January to conzlude its negotiations with the Turkish
Government. These negotiations appear to be leading nowhere and, on
‘the asstimption that VOA-will.not gain entrance t> Turkey, the Depart-
ment has authorized RFE to bezin negotiations on the 2>0ve date.

2. Bob Lang, Bila Durkr: end Mr. Wadsworth, forver Axhaseador
to Turkey, a5 well ag the I Dfvision have all beer in on discussions
as to how NCFS should approach the Turks. Mr. Wadewsrth counzels
that all cards be laid on the table, and ha bares. his reasoning on
his belief that the Turks will mow about it anyhow znd that RFE is
likely to get further if. it comes clean. The NE Divicion on the
other hand hopes that the approach can de that of a crivate committee
and that ro mention need be made of CIA's interest.

3. Your adyice on the atieve question will not constitute approval
of the building of a Turkish station or of operations from Turkey. By
PR? decision at. the last hearing on KCPE's budeet these questions in
Turkey must be brought back’here for apsfoval if the axtitude of the

Turks is favorable. :

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN. NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS ‘FUGITIVES

Z2aitorial by Ne van Weuwenhuysént Reformatorisch Dagblad,

Dutch, 19 April 1974, p37

Q The Chilean refugees in ‘the Netherlands seem to: be
having adjustment problems... These rather prolonged symptoms
seem to be caused among other ‘things by-the fact that they
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of
"their Marxist president is definitely over and that their

country is now being ruled by a small group of reactionaries
who are trying to keep the people under control through
terrorism, représsion,” and torture. Such problems will take
you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were
Quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

What is the situation?’ Most of the approximately

. 250 refugees with a high school or university education do
not work. About half of them have been housed at the "Huis
ter Schie” in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on
the terrace.or play volleyball in the yard. 3oard and
lodging are free and at the end:of the week they -pick up
another 25 guildérs pocket money. In addition they réceive
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and
compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they are better off than
many.old people in the Netherlands? You are probably right,
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare;
they are being paid from the frozen funds which. had been
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.


Considering that this small group of pampered exiles
is. preaching revolution e here and with a full stomach,
it may be useful to poifit out a few facts. These are facts
which are well knowh in thé Ministry in The Hague but. for
some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

Facts

The great majority of the refugees are not even sAESICenssarass
Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and zi
Uruguay. *’ They came to Chile as a result of illeral and

revolutionary activities in which they had been involved in

these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate

consequences of which they did not wish*to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende'’s Chile because Allende
showed sympathy for their situation. His, first action aa
president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to
declare amnegty for all those who "were members of terrorist
underground organizations,” those who during the last months
of his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank
robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft
of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and attempted

murder.

The fact that some of those revolutionaries received
Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of
granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.
These refugees witha high achool or higher level education
seemed to have no adjustment problems in Chile. As a result
they soon found their way to important key positions in the

government.

The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in
Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant
Marxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutpnaries,
from all points of the compass, were at their disposal.

Definition

In the Berner Tageblatt, a Swiss newspaper which
is known for not SuageeTating. Dr. Kario Puelma, from the
University of Freiburg, wrote the following: “The concept
of political refugee is only of limited value when applied

to Chile. Whatever one's attitude toward the military junta


may be, one thing is certains the Chilean refugees were not
pursued only because of their ideology, their status, or
their origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian defini-
tion for a refugee. For the mont part they are people who,
in their own country, could be legally charged with crimes
which are punishable under any judicial system.

These refugees carried. out activities in Chile which
were against the constitution, As a matter of fact, they are
specialists in violence. This is why they sought asylum in
the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are so many

foreigners among thea."
