MEMOHANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT:

RET

in Turkey

ACTTON NECESSARY:

Will you pleage decide or cause to be decided the

following question:

Snould the Sational Comnittee for a Free Buroo:

in its approach to

Turkish anthorities exploring the possibility of

creating an RFE station in Turcoy contact Turkish astrorities as a

non-governmental private Committee or as a CIA-financee institution?

Back round

1o.

The State Department has asked that RE not approach Turkish

authorities until VOA's attempt to zet into Turkey has been

accepted

or refused by

the Turks.

The Icpartment has now given the Voice of

America until 15 January to conclude Its negotiations with the Turkish

Government.

These negotlations appear to be leading rowhere and, on

the assumption that VA will not pain entrance to Turkey, the Depart

ment. has nithorized RFE to borin negotiations on the above date.

2:

Bob Lang, Bili Turkan and M. Wadsworth, former Araceader

to Turkey, as well as the lS Division have all beer in on discussions

as to how Nors should approach the Turks. Mr. Wadworth counsels

that all cards be laid on the tacle, and he bases his reasoning on

his belies that the Turke will mon about it anyhou: and that PIE 13

likely to got further lf it, cores clean.

The NE Division on the

other hand hopes that the äpproach can be that of a private committee

and that no mention need be nade of CIA's interest.

3.

Your advice on the above question will not construte approval

of the building of a Turkish station or of operations from Turkey. By

PRo decision at the last nearing on Norers budeet these muestions in

Turkey mist be brought back here for approval if the attitude of the

Turks is favorable.

NETHERLANDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Editorial by No

Sutto 19 DyN 1994 Fewenhuysens Reformatorisch Daeblad,

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be

having adjustment problems. These rather prolonged symptoms

seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they

still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of

their karxist president is definitely over and that their

country is now being ruled by a small

group of reactionaries

who are trying to keep the people under control through

terrorism, repression, and torture.

Such problems will

take

you quite

a ways in the letherlands and those idealists were

quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

What is the situation?

Most of the approximately

250 refugees with a high

school or university education do

not work.

About half of them have been housed at the "Huis

ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on

the terrace or play volleyball in the yard.

Board and

lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up

another 25 guilders pocket money.

In addition they receive

free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and

compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they

are better off than

many. old people

in the Netherlands?

You are probably right.

because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare;

they

are being paid from the frozen funds which had been

allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.

So you can see how well our tax

money is being spent.

CENTRAL BANK DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB

IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON THE COUTTRY'S MEAGER FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RESERVES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 80%

IN OCTOBER AND OTHER PRICE RISES PUSHED INFLATION TO SOME 770%

FOR THE YEAR.

4.. THE JUNTA HAS HOW AGREED TO FOLLOU THE STABILIZATION

PROGRAM PROPOSED BY AN IMF TEAM WHICH VISITED CHILE IN LATE 197%.

THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING

INFLATION TO 100% IN 1974. THIS IMF PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE BUT MAY

BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY

CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACCER-

BATING THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING INFLATION. ADHERENCE TO THE IMF

PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVEI CHILE'S COREDIT RATING, AS HAS THE

SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON CHILE'S

1971-1972 DEBT. CHILE IS THUS IN A RELATIVELY GOOD POSITION FOR

THE OPENING OF THE PARIS CLUB TALKS IN FEBRUARY• THE MASSIVE $4

BILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN DEBT • HOWEVER, WILL CAUSE CHILE DALANCE OF

CIVILIAN ADVISERS TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES.

THIS

PHENOMENON IS MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND IN

SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. THE IMPORTANCE

OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS. HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE

IS WELL KNOWN. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AlL ADVISORY BOARD

DOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, WHILE THE MINISTRY OF

HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT

ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY

AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY

BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS

AFFECTED BY THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.

IZ• IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A

LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN

EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KNOUN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IF INTER

NATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEU CONSTITUTION: BUT THERE

ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCA

TIONAL SYSTEM, COLLECTING INFORHATION ON UNEGEMPLOYMENT, URITING A

L2: ALTHOUGH SOME CHRISTIAN DENOCRATS HOLD INFLUENTIAL GOVERN-

MENT POSITIONS, MOST CIVILIAN ADVISERS ARE EITHER CONSERVATIVE OR

APOLITICAL. LACK OF MORE UIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION: BY CHRISTIAN

LEMOCRATS MAY CREATE PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVEREMENT IN THE FUTURE.

ESPECIALLY SINCE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING WORKERS, CAMPESINOS

AND POBLADORES WHICH FORMERLY SUPPORTED EITHER THE CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDCS OR THE ALLENDE GOVERNMENTE ARE SO FAR

INADEQUATELY REPRESENTED ON ADVISORY COUNCILS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS

ESTABLISHED UNITS ADDRESSED TO YOUTH; WOMEN, GUILDS AND NEIGHBOR-

HOOD CIVIC GROUPS IN THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT, AND

HOPES THAT THESE WILL SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR GOVERNMENT-TO-PEOPLE

COMMUNICATION.

THAT PERU MAY ATTACK CHILE SOME TIME PRIOR TO 1979, THE 100TH

ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR GETUEEN CHILE AND PERU, IN ORDER TO REGAIN

SOME OF THE TERRITORY LOST IN THAT WAR. THE CHILEANS ARE WORRIED BY

THE SOVIET SALE OF ARTS TO PERU AND FEAR THAT THE USSR MAY BE TRY-

LATIN AMERICA.

25º THE JUNTA IS ALSO CONCERNED BY COMMUNIST EFFORTS TO CREATE

INTERNAL DISCONTENT AND TO MOUT AN INTERMAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.

THE JUNTA EXPECTS THAT THE FORMER UP PARTIES, LED BY THE CONMUNISTS.

POLITICAL DISCONTENT, AND WILL TRY TO MANIFULATE THE PEDE INTO

REBUILD THE ECONOMY BY ADOPTING A HARSH AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND IN

B. SANTIAGO MOVED QUICKLY AFTER THE COUP TO REMOVE PRICE

EFFECTIVELY DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB

IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON SANTIAGO'S MEAGER FOREIGN EX-

IN OCTOBER, BRINGING INFLATION TO NEARLY 4S0% FOR THE FIRST TEN MONTHS

OF THE YEAR. ANTICIPATED PRICE RISES DURING THE REST OF 1973 IS EX-

PECTED TO PUSH INFLATION TO SOME 750% FOR THE YEAR.

MARKETS IN COMMODITIES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE. WHILE EXCHANGE RATES

CHANGED AND PRICES ROSE, THE GROWTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS BEEN

SHARPLY CURTAILED, CAUSING A RELATIVE SCARCITY OF LOCAL CURRENCY AND

A LIQUIDITY CRUNCH FOR BUSINESSMEN.

D. THE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS HAS BEEN HEAVY DESPITE A

HEALTHY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUN WAGE, WORKING CLASS CONSUMERS ARE

FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THE BAREST NECESSITIES.

AUSTERITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN MANY CASES BY DISMISSALS OF

• RELATIVELY UNPRODUCTIVE AND POLITICALLY SUSPECT EMPLOYEES HIRED

UNDER THE ALLENDE REGIME. AN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM HAS

BEEN ANNOUNCED AND AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM IS UNDER CON

SIDERATION.

E. THE JUNTA IS ATTEMPTING TO ENLIST PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR

THE AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND BUSINESS IS SHOWING RENEWED CONFIDENCE.

IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974 EVEN IF DEST-REPAYMENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH

YEARS, WITH A MASSIVE #4 BILLION FOREIGN DEBT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S

HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANCE-OF

PAYMENTS POSITION IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY.

G. HOWEVER: COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED MORE

THAN 50% ABOVE LAST YEAR'S LEVEL AS A RESULT OF A 9% LENGTHENING OF

THE WORK WEEK AND IMPROVED MINE MANAGEMENT. PRODUCTION WILL PROBABLY

REACH À RECORD ?50,000 TONS NEXT YEAR DESPITE CONTINUING SHORTAGES OF

QUICKLY, LONG RUN GROWTH WILL DEPEND HEAVILY ON CHILE'S ABILITY TO:

ATTRACT ADEQUATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT. ATTRACTION OF SUBSTANTIAL NEW

INVESTMENT WILL DEPEND ON THE JUNTA'S ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD

WELL AS

FAITH IN THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EQUITY ASTHEIR ABILITY TO INSTILL I

CONFIDENCE IN CHILE'S PROSPECTS FOR STABLE RECOVERY AND GROWTH. A

CRITICAL FIRST STEP IS TIMELY SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING COMPENSBATION

CLAIMS EMANATING FROM THE ALLENDE NATIONALIZATIONS. THE JUNTA HAS

STATED THAT IT WILL EITHER RETURN INTERVENED FIRMS TO THE PRIVATE

SECTOR OR, AS IN THE CASE OF THE LARGE COPPER MINES, ADEQUATELY

COMPENSATE THE PREVIOUS OUNERS. SOME 90 FIRMS ARE ALREADY IN THE

PROCESS OF REVERSION.

So THUS FAR THE JUNTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN LINING UP SUF-

Y: A SALVAR A SHILE DEL ANIQUILAMIENTO POLITICO, SOCIALA Y ECONOMICO.

SE ABREN AMORA PERSPECTIVAS DE RECUPERACION MEDIANTE UN

INTENSO Y DISCIPLINADO ESFUERZO QUE RESTABLEZCA EL HABITO DEL

TRABAJO, NORMALICE LAS FAENAS. DETENGA LA DESTRUCCION DEL PATRIMONIO

NACIONAL. Y REINICIE EL PROCESO DE CAPITALIZACION INDISPENSABLE

AL FUTURO BIENESTAR.

CON iNNEGABLE SACRIFICIO Y ABNEGATION, LAS FUERZAS

ARMADAS MAS CUMPLIDO SU PAPEL DE SALVAGUARDIA ULTIMA DE LA

INSTITUCIONALIDAD, PERO LA DURA TAREA QUE IMPONE RESTANAR LAS

HERIDAS Y REANUDAR LA MARCHA DE LA NACION EXIGE EL APOYO RESUELTO

DE AQUELLA MAYORIZ CUIDADANA QUE: EN TODOS LOS TONOS, HA PEDIDO

UNA HONDA RECTIFICACION.

EL QUEBRANTAMIENTO CONSTITUCIONAL PROVOCADO POR EL MARXISMO

NO PUDO SOLDARSE CON LAS SOLAS INICIATIVAS DE LOS PARTIDOS

POLITICOS. LAS FUERZAS ARMADAS Y CARABINEROS NO DESEABAN NI

HAD DESEADO NUNCA TOMAR SOBRE SI LA RESPONSIBILIDAD DE CONDUCIR

LOS DESTINOS DE LA NACION, PERO EL DRAMATICO FRAÇASO DE LA UNIDAD

POPULAR Y LAS LIMITAGIONES DEL CUADRE POLITICO OPOSITOR PARA

CONSEGUIR EL INDISPENSABLE CAMBIO DE RUMBO FORZARON LA SITUACION

HASTA EL PUNE EN QUE SE ENQUEN?RA. •

BUCIONES DEL PODER JUDICIAL, CONTANDO CON LA ASESORIA DE LA

CONTRALORLA GENERAL DE LA REPUBLICA Y DISPONIENDO EL RECESO DEL

PARLAMENTE. DE ESTE MODO LA JUNTA CREE ENCONTRAR EL CAMINO

ADECUADO PARA INSTAURAR LA INSTITUCIONALIDAD QUE SE REQUIERE.

LAS RESERVAS QUE ESTA POSICION DE LA JUNTA PUEDAN INSPIRAR

A CIERTOS SECTORES POLITICOS NO PUEDEN SER TAN ABSOLUTAS QUE

LLEGUEN HASTA NEGAR EL CONCURSO DE TODOS LOS CHILENOS AL ESFUERZO

DE RECONSTRUCCION DE SU PATRIA,,

POR EL CONTRARIO, A TRAVES

DE LA JUNTA, ES CHILE MISMO EL QUE JUEGA LA CARTA DEFINITIVA

PARA TRIUNFAR DEL OD!O, DE LA DESUNION, DEL DESALIENTO Y DE LA

DECADENCIA. LA LABOR IMPONE LA ACCION LE TODAS LAS CAPACIDADES

Y LA COLABORACION DE TODA LA CUIDADANIA, ESPECIALMENTE DE

AQUELLOS CHILENOS QUE POR SU INDIFERENTISMO, SU INDECISION.

SU EGOISMO O SU PEREZA HAN GENERADO LAS CONDICIONES QUE PER-

MITIERON EL DESARROLLO DE LA IDEOLOGIA MARXISTA Y SU LLEGADA
