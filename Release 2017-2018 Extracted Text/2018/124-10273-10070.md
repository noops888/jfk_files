On the basis of this information, we immediately instructed the

appropriate Post Office officials to determine the feasibility of covering outgoing

communication dispatched to the alorementioned address.

On January 21, 1958, SAQ Powers of the New York Office called

could possibly be effected at LaGuardia Airfield. Powers stated that he subsequently

received a call from the Chief Post Office Inspector who told him that he would not

be able to make such arrangements and explained that something had happened in

Washington on a similar matter and that Bureau Headquarters should take up the

matter with Post Office Headquarters here in Washington. The Post Office

Inspector said that it did not involve our agency and because of what was going

MEMO TO: MR. BOARDMAN

RE: COVERAGE OF MATI TO THE(U.S.S. R.)

and in view of the volume of material being sent from the U.S., their coverage

is an extensive and expensive operation. He indicated that they had to set up an

elaborate array of IBM machines to tally and tabulate the results. In addition

a complicated indexing procedure was involved, as well as complex scientific

examinations of the material.

He further

indicated that the coverage has been in existence in excess of a year and he

stated that the sole purpose for the coverage was to identify persons behind the

Iron Curtain who might have some ties in the U,S. and who could be approached

fin their countries as contacts and souroes for CIA. Angleton indicated that CLA

had successfully developed several sources through this means.

He stressed

the confidential nature of his information and stated that while other officials of

CIA more directly concerned with the coverage were expecting a visit from the

"'By he was passing this along for our guidance.

It would appear that our inquiries of the Post Office officials in

New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question

immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York

has invaied our jurisdiction. In this regard, it is believed that they have a

legitimate right in the objectives for which the coverage was set up, namely,

the development of contacts and sources of information behind the Iron Curtain,

and according to Angleton they have had some success: in this regard. At the

same time, there is an internal security objective here in which, because of

our responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of

illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States..

While recognizing

this interest, it is not believed that the Bureau should assume this coverage

because of the inherent dangers in the sensitive nature of it, its complexity,

size and expense. It is believed that we can capitalize on this coverage by

pointing out to CIA our internal security objectives and holding them responsible

to share their coverage with us. Of course, we are not interested in the

identities of the numerous persons in this country legitimately corresponding

abroad. The Post Office has indicated there are approximately four thousand

items of correspondence to the U.S.S. R. each day. Angleton said they have not

Icome up with a microdot or secret message communication as yet.

ACTION:

1. On the basis of our inquiries conducted in New York, we are in

a position and should, through Liaison, approach ClA, informing them that It

has been indicated that their Agency has coverage of mail going to the J.S.s.R

We Should get from them the details of their coverage and explain our interest in

I determined that CIA began this coverage approximately a year and a half ago through

confidential arrangements made with postal authorities. Initially, this coverage

involved photographing of envelopes; these envelopes were not to be opened.

secret writing has been made to a limited extent because the volume of mail has been too

humerous for the establishment of a practical system without delaying moverent of the

mail, «CIA has advised that to date it has not discovered any microdots or secret writing

or information revealing evidence of Soviet intelligence operations in the United States.

Cia has also advised that this program has not reached its full potential, but that its

system of opening mail is rapidly increasing. CIA has expressed a willingness to

furnish us any information obtained from this coverage which we feel would be of

interest to us.

An analysis has been made of CIA capabilities as revealed to the Liaison Agent

and it is believed we should request that CIA furnish us information of the following

types, both that which has been received in the past and that which they will obtain inc

the future?

Reach

All correspondence of a suspicious nature, such as that containing double

talls, et cetera.

2)

All correspondence indicating that the Soviets may be utilizing a hostage

have close relatives in the U.S. or pressure being exerted on individuäls in U.S.

re: COVERAGE OF MAIL TO THE U.S.S.P.)

With regard to the above coverage, it is believed desirable that Liaison make

arrangements for us to review at CIA any material of this nature and we will then

select that which appears to warrant investigation and then make appropriate checks.

This procedure will eliminate.having CIA sending us a bunch of worthless material with

the possible expectation that we will be running out leads for them. It is believed this

arrangement can be wacked out with CIA in a proper fashion.

In addition to the above it is believed the following arrangements can be

effected with CIA:

1)

Place stops against names and addresses of individuals possibly presently

engaged in Soviet espionage to determine if they are in correspondence with U.S. S. R

This. would include a check of the back traffic on these individuals also. We would, of

course, make these stops on a highly selective basis.

Request CIA to place stops against addresses in Soviet Russia believed by the

Bureau to be mail drops or suspected mail drops. (It should be noted that we already

have placed a stop with CIA against the name and address of_

which, according to information received from ivй-5,

is a drop utilized by Soviet)illegal agents all over the world arranging emergency meet-

ings.

We will, of course, continue to analyze this coverage by CIA to see that we

obtain maximum benefits.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1) ' That information received from this source be hereinafter designated as

Bureau Informant. 200 Records Section has advised that this informant symbol has

hot been previously used.

2)

That this matter and any mail relating thereto be labeled "June" and then

filed and maintained in the Sovme) Unit, Room 1734 (the regular repository of "June"

mall) to afford maximum security to this source.

That our Liaison Agent orally advise CIA of the type of data set forth above

that would be of interest to us and make arrangements with CIA so that we can review

• this type of information in order to select that which we feel will warrant further

investigation. Liaison should also perfect the arrangement with CIA so that on a

.. The intercept project that has been explained orally to

(Mr. Papich) will be referred to as Project HUNTER in correspondence

between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and this Agenay.

2. This explanatory memorandum constitutes HUNTER Report

#1.

Future disseminations will be numbered consecutively.

3. In submitting possible traces on individuals of interest to

you, reports will be submitted in the following form:

a. I the individual named in the intercept appears to be

identical with the individual of interest to you, you will be furnished

a reproduction of the exterior, and of the contents if the item has been

• opened.

b. If the individual named in the intercept is only possibly

identical with the individual of interest to you, only machine run

listing of the items will be submitted. In such cases a reproduction

of the exterior and of the contents, if the item has been opened, will

be available upon request.

4o In order to facilitate your reading of machine run entries,

there follows an explanation of the various types of replies which you

will receive in connection with requests.

A hypothetical request for

any addressee in the U.S. of mail fromP. KROVAN, whose location

is believed to be in Moscow, might result in the following reply:

This reply has the following meaning:

"A" has no present meaning. All numbers are now preceeded by

"A"' only to-allow for future additional classifications. None are

presently contemplated.

"57COS'is the date of intercept, namely: "57 is the year. "C"

indicates the month. The code key for months is set out as Enclosure 1.

"05" is the day of the month. Thus, "57C05" is 5 March 1957.

The group "C3325" is our own internal filing number.

The 'Name In' entzy identifies the correspondent inside the UsSR.

The asterisk in "Rel" column indicates that KROVAN sent the lettex

The entry in "Loc"(ation) column indicates the area or city inside

he soviet Union trom which the letter was mailed. In this case it was

mailed from the western section of Ukrainian SSR. The code key

used for this column is set out in Enclosure 2. This code key is to

be used for all items prior to 1 January 1958, on which date a 4-place

code was instituted in order to designate more precisely the localities

withia the USSR. A copy of this new code is enclosed as Enclosure 3.

The "Name Out" entry identifies the correspondent outside the

(USSR)

In both the "Name In" and "Name Out" columns, the last or

family name is listed first.

The absence of an asterisk in the "Ref"' column after EVOSWA

indicates that she is the recipient of the letter.

The entry in the second "Loc"(ation) column indicates the state of

the U.S. (in this case, New Jersey) to which the letter was addressed.

The code key used for this column is set out in Enclosure 4. You

will note that some 3-digit entries indicate large cities within a state,

thus KO indicates New York State and KOA indicates New York City.

For your convenience an alphabetical list of the states with their code

indicator is set out in Enclosure 5.

The absence of an "X"' in the "Ban" column means that the letter

was not opened and that baly the exterior is recorded in'our files.

5. Since the hypothetical request was for mall doz(P. BROVANy

who is believed to be located in Moscow, only the listing as set out

above would be furnished, since it would not appear that Paraskoviya

located in the western section of the Ukrainian SSR is

identical? I in cornection wih furure investigation or information

otherwise available, you may believe that (KROVAN)may be identical

with the individual of interest to you, you need reference only the

HUNTER report number and request the exterior photographs of

item No. A57C05C3325, which will be reproduced from the original

film and made available to you.

be as follows:

Date.

ASTOZSU STD18 AVRUNENA, Vera) *) sAA (BSTERSON, ROse)

KKB X

The difference in this listing from that previously illustrated is as follows:

"Y" is our internal identifying designator. The first date is the date

of the intercept.

The second date is the date of the communication

inside the letter. The "X" under the "Ban" column indicates the letter

was opened. Again this indicator would indicate only a possible identi

fication since KKB under "Loc" indicates California. In this instance

upon request, identifying the HUNTER report number and referencing

both A57D23U and 57Dl8 numbers, the outer envelopes and their con-

tents will be reproduced and furnished to you.

7. Normal service of either of the above requests will be 24 hours.

In an emergency we could service the request in a few minutes.

8. If your first request had been for KROVAN, or P. KROVAN,

or Paraskoviya KROVAN located in the western section of the

Ukrainian SSR, you would have initially received the photograph of

these students have already been recruited by one or the other

of the major Soviet Intelligence Services. We know also that

many of the exchange students will subsequently be posted to the

PROJECT HUNTER has identified numerous individuals

dependa

For approximately one month beginning in February

1963,

Central Intelligence Agency. (CIA) had coverage of mail destined to

(Cuba) which was funneled through New York City from approximately

one half of the United States.

the results of this higaly contidential

project were furnished us under the code ("Hunter-Vince' through

special arrangements made with CIA. The project has been temporarily

as to its reinstitution based on the results achieved.

During the period the coverage was in effect, we received

94 items and opened 15 new cases based on the material.

While no

spectic data was developed indicating clandestine messages were

being transmitted, we know that one of the illegal. Cuban agent networks

has plans for mail drops in the New York City area, and this coverage |.

could conceivably lead us to these drops in the future. We have

previously furnished CIA summaries concerning positive

results

achieved through its coverage of (Soviet mail for its assistance in

evaluating whether that program should be continued. It is believed

we should do so in this instance.
