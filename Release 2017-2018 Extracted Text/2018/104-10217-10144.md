MEMORANDUM FOR: AC/Wa/COG
SUBJECT 2 Release of AMCALL-1

1. The negotiation for AMCALL-1"s release was completed
by AMECRU-1 on 26 August and $120,000 ransom was paid to the
Cuban negotiator in Paris at that time. $79,000 of the ransom
was provided by the Agency and the $50,000 balance was paid
by representatives of the Catholic Church. AMECRU-1 anticipated {
AMCALL~1's release would be effected within two months from the :
time the negotiation was completed. If the Cubans meet this Q

tentative time schedule, AMCALL-1 should arrive in Madrid by
the last week of October.

there would appear to be no cause for alarm that nothing further
has been heard .about-AMCALL-1's release. Although AMSIGH<2-was
released within one month of the time his ransom was paid, AMRIPE-2
was not released for two months. The Cuban Government demonstrated
its good faith in these negotiations by refunding the AMPANIC-7
ransom but they have consistently refused to set a definite time
table for release of any prisoner which, they insist, is dictated

by individual circumstances and internal conditions at a specific
time.
