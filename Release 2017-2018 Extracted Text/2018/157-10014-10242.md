Cuban Extremists in U.S.

\A GROWING TERROR THREAT |
sf |i
| Z—> JAMAICA a, |

Out from Miami spreads a wave of vio-
lence. Terrorists’ aim is to topple Castro, free
Cuba. Nearly all Cuban refugees share this
dream. But the acts of a few zealots create
trouble for fellow exiles and for the U.S.

Reported from
MIAMI and WASHINGTON

Terrorism by radical Cuban refugees has become a thorny
problem in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and, in the
view of some authorities, a potential threat to the lives of
American leaders.

The terrorists’ goal is to wrest control of Cuba away from
its Communist dictator, Fidel Castro.

In pursuit of that goal, they have blazed a trail of violence
from Miami across the Caribbean Sea, not only to Cuba-but
also to Mexico, Barbados, Jamaica and Panama—even across
the South Atlantic to Argentina

They have engaged in a series of bombings in the U.S. and
abroad. They have carried out military-style attacks on
Communist ships. They are strongly suspected of several
killings

ties and their leaders.

Now, as a new Administration prepares to take over in
Washifigton, it is feared that the Cuban terrorists will step up
their attacks in an effort to thwart any turn toward reconcili-
ation with Castr
Is familiar with their operations warn that some of
iban “extremists will stop at nothing, not even at
ssinating members of the Carter Administration.

The Cuban terrorists are the most highly trained assassins
insthe world today,” says one US. official

Many of the terrorists were trained by the Central Intetli-
gence Agency in Uie days when this country was trying to
overthrow Castro, or kill him

The Setiate Internal Security Subcommittee recently held
hearings on the Cubun-terrorist threat, It heard this testimo-
ny from Lt. Thomas Lyons, head of a special antiterrorist
squad of the Dade County public-safety department. in

Other investigators charge that the terrorists, to finance
their crusade, have dealt in cocaine and prostitution and-in-
extortion from wealthy fellow refugees.

The number of hard-core* terrorists is- smitll, officially
estimated at fewer than 300. But their reach is wide. In this
year alone they have cither bragged about or been accused}

EXILES vs.
CASTRO—

A Relentless
Pursuit

On Jan. 1, 1959, Fidel Castro took power and
the first wave of refugees fled Cuba. A small
number of the 600,000 exiles who settled in the
U.S. have become extremists.

Highlights of events in those 18 years, some
involving law-abiding exiles, others involving the
extremists—

* 1964: A 1,300-man Cuban Brigade, armed and

» trained by the U.S. in Florida, Guatemala and Nica-

Tagua, landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba’s south
shore. The invasion was a failure.

1962: Survivors of the Bay of Pigs were released
by Castro after payment of a 53-million-dollar ran-
som in drugs, food, medical equipment and other
supplies from “private contributions.” President
John F. Kennedy, in Miami, pledged to the Cuban
exiles that the Brigade flag would one day fly over a
liberated Cuba.

U.S. launched its secret “Operation Mongoose” —
@ plan. to use Cuban exiles in paramilitary war
against Castro while U.S. maintained an economic
blockade to shake the island's economy, The attacks
generally failed,

1964: Cuban extremists in New York City fired a
mortar shell at United Nations as Cuba's Ché Gue-
vara addressed the General Assembly.

1967: Cuban exile specialists and U.S.-trained
Bolivian troops trapped and killed Guevara and
some of his Communist guerrillas in Bolivia.

1968-72: Cuban-exile extremists bombed ships
of nations considered to be friendly to Castro, ter-
rorized other exiles to keep them in line.

1972: Cuban exiles trained by Central Intelli-
gence Agency took part in Watergate break-in, later
testified that they thought it would help their anti-
Castro campaign. ,

1973: U.S. and Cuba signed agreement aimed at
controlling hijacking of aircraft and piracy of ships
at sea, i

1974-76: Cuban extremists exploded more than
100 bombs in Miami area in two-year period, hitting

. offices of the FBI,-a State attorney and the Miami

police department,

Who are these terrorists? What motivates them? How do
they operate? And why are U.S. officials so concerned about
what they may do in the future?

To answer such questions, Orr Kelly and Car! J. Migdail of
the US. News & World Report stall dug deeply into the
records, interviewed Cuban refugees who share the hopes
though not the methods of the terrorists, and talked to law:
enforcement officials who are trying to stem the violence,

BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISM

After Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and it became
apparent that he intended to establish a Communist state,
800,000 Cubans “voted with their feet” and fled their
homeland. Some 600,000 of them settled in the United
States. They and their children now total 750,000. Most of
them live in the Miami area,

The majority of these immigrants are law abiding. But
Miami’s “Little Havana” provides a culture in which the
virus of violence can grow.

“In Miami,” explains one refugee leader, “the Cubans
keep their national identity, their heritage, traditions,
hatreds—und their hopes of going back to their homeland.
And they know they can’t go back until Castro is gone. So

\they dream of toppling Castro. What is clearly unrealistic in

other places in the United States seems very possible in the
aimosphere in Miami.”

In the early 1960s, the overthrow of Castro seemed to the
Cubans in exile to be not only possible but almost inevitable
It was U.S. policy to drive him from power, There was an
attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 196) with an
army of Cuban exiles recruited and trained in seeret by the
CIA. The invaders were not given the air cover necessary for
u successful attack, and the operation was a disaster. Only
180 of about 1,300 invaders escaped death or capture. The
Cubans felt betrayed

Then came other American moves a inst Castro. There
was a secret “Operation Mongoose,” which included efforts
to assassinate the Cuban leader. The United States backed an
economic blockade of Cuba in an attempt to prevent Castro
from obtaining sorely needed supplies and equipment from
abroud. Later, Cuban refugees were ysed to carry out secret
operations not only in the Caribbean but also in other parts
of Latin America—and even in Africa.

To many Cuban refugees, attacking Castro and Commu-
nism became a way of life,

Since then, however, American policy has failed to match
in intensity the fieree anti-Castro Passion of the more mili-
tant refugees. In recent years, prominent members of the
US. Senate have visited Cuba In 1973, Cuba made un
tgreement with the United States to curb the airplane
hijackers who had been using Cuba as asylum, There wore
moves un both sides toward normalization of relations be.
tween Cuba and the U.S.

As their hopes of American action against Castro ebbed,
some Cubun refugees turned to violence on their own, The
box on this page gives the chronology of developments,

CUBAN EXTREMISTS

[continued from preceding page)

includes representatives from Dade County and Miami po-

lice, the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Bu-

reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force,
_ its agents work closely with it.

With co-operation from Cuban refugees who are sick of
the terrorist violence, law officers have arrested a number of
suspects. Police also have learned enough about other sus-
pects so that their freedom to engage in new aets of violence
can be limited even though there is not enough evidence to
prosecute them.

A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might
have some knowledge of terror operations.

Efforts of law-enforcement officials to deal with the terror-
ist groups face formidable handicaps, however. The terrorists
seem to know what police are doing. Lieutenant Lyons
relates that one suspect “identified one of my officers who
had never met him before, called him by name and told him
what-section he worked in and what his duties were.”

Terrorists are protected by a web of old loyalties. Most of
them worked at one time or another for the U.S. Govern-
ment. Many have had several roles: members of the U.S.
Army, CIA operatives and FBI informants. One refugee
leader suggests that law-enforcement officials have not found
the killers of Cubans “because they don't want to.”

A further complication is the heavy -infiltration of the
terrorist movement by members of Castro's intelligence
corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as
agents provocateurs, instigating terrorist acts designed to
discredit the refugees and influence American policy.

The Cuban Prime Minister has “surfaced” enough of such
agents to reveal their pattern of operation. Early this year,
for example, Manuel de Armas, a Cuban refugee who was
named in Senate committee testimony as having been in-
volved in terrorist activities in Miami, showed up in Havana.
In an April 22 broadcast by Radio Havana, De Armas said
that he had supplied the explosives used in the killing of a
man named Rolando Masferrer and that a CIA agent had
provided him with the explosives.

In a speech on October 15, Castro boasted of a double
agent who Castro claimed had passed on coded instructions

from the CIA. Said Castro: “From the very moment when he
was recruited by the CIA and over-a period of 10 years, the
supposed agent has kept the Cuban Government fully in-
formed of all his contacts with [the CIA] and of the equip-
ment and instructions he has received.”

Castro blamed the CIA for the airliner bombing and other
acts of violence,’Who else but the CIA. . . can carry out
these acts?” Castro asked.

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.
involvement in the airliner bombing. He “T can state
categorically that no official of the United States Govern-
ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in
contact with the American Government has had anything to
do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this
totally reprehensible.”

The CIA declines to discuss Cuban refugee terrorism.
Officials of other Government agencies say they seriously
doubt that the CIA, after all the criticism it has received for
some of ‘its earlier activities, is still involved in operations
against the Castro.regime. However, the agency is described
as providing very little help in combatting the terrorist
groups. “We have absolutely no contact with the CLA,” says
Lieutenant Lyons. “I'd like to, but they don’t talk to us.” One
reason for that attitude may be that laws bar the CIA from
domestic law-enforcement activities.

Other laws, or the lack of them, also complicate the fight
against the terrorists. U.S. agencies cannot become involved
in investigations of terrorism outside the United States unless
the crime involves violations of neutrality laws making it
illegal to conspire in this country to commit crimes abroad or
to export arms without a license.

Although shocked by the October 6 airliner bombing, U.S.
officials reluctantly decided there was no authorization for
the FBI to enter that case.

With such handicaps as these, law-enforcement officials say
they can look forward to only limited success against the
terrorists. Any real solution to the problem must come from
within the Cuban refugee community—and investigators
state that the co-operation they get there does not extend to
cases of violence committed outside the U.S.

WHAT HAVE TERRORISTS GAINED?
As officials size up the effects of the terrorist campaign:
The only tangible accomplishment has been to push Castro
into renouncing the antihijacking
treaty, thus discouraging efforts to-
ward a diplomatic reconciliation be-
tween the United States and Cuba.
Despite all the terrorist plots and
attacks, Castro remains firmly seat-
ed as head of a Communist regime
in Cuba, And it appears to the refu-
gees almost. inevitable that the

MEMORANDUM i
TO: RECORD
FROM: HOWARD S. LIEBENGOOD

SUBJECT: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION OF JANUARY 19, 1977

I called Larry Callahan at 2:00 p.m. to advise him that
the Commiteee desired to interview Mr. Gene A. Boren, of
the IRS, at the earliest available opportunity and requested
his advice and assistance to accomplish this. Callahan was
nervous about the Committee's eagerness to proceed in response
to the memorandum for fear that we would be interfering with
an on-going criminal investigation. He noted the FBI was looking
into this and he would have to check with the Bureau to
ascertain the feasibility of proceeding unilaterally. I told
Callahan we did not want to interfere with a criminal investi-
gation and that I did not feel that our interview of the IRS
employee would fall into that category. Callahan referred to
a possible obstruction of justice on the part of that employee
in that the information had been withheld for approximately
five years,

At 2:30 p.m. I received a telephone call from Paul Daly
urging Committee restraint in unilaterally investigating
subject matter. Daly noted the Bureau had just received this

information and was intending to interview the IRS employee

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 25


and other individuals in question today or tomorrow. Daly
noted that he was disturbed that Callahan had brought the

memo to the Committee's attention so promptly, as the Bureau
had intended to brief the Committee at the conclusion of their
investigation. Daly seemed most concerned that the IRS delay
in bringing the matter to the’ Bureau's attention and assured
us that the Bureau was desirous of cooperating fully. He
noted the information had been furnished by Justice absent

a specific inquiry from the Committee and that we were being
unreasonable if we desired to pursue.the matter further at

this time. I asked Daly what information was available at the
Bureau on Brading and Hunt. He said there was a large quantity
of information available on both and that he felt he could pull
that material which related. to the assassination quickly, but
would be reluctant to produce the information in its entirety.
I told him to ascertain this afternoon what information could
be produced immediately and he said that he would.

At 2:45 p.m. I talked again with Callahan who indicated
that Daly would be calling. Callahan said he thought the
Bureau was eager to redeem itself in this area and we should
give them that opportunity. I told Callahan that I was con-
cerned about i gecaet bodice of sitet position which Callahan
thinks is ridiculous. Callahan, however, did state that this
information was not as old as it looks at the Bureau, to-wit:

While the Justice received the IRS memo on December 30, 1976,

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 26


considerable time went by before Attorney General, Levi could
address the issue of whether or not to entrust this matter to
the Bureau. Approximately one week ago, Justice went to Jim
Adams of the FBI with the request to look into the allegation
and was surprised to find that Adams was already apprised of
the situation and investigating, i.e., general indexes.
Apparently, Adams had been in receipt of similar information
in recent days.

Yesterday, in response to the Attorney General's request
for information, Paul Daly hand carried to Callahan the Bureau's
response (which oe dated January 14) and today Callahan hand
carried the package to us over Assistant Attorney. General
Uhlmann;s signature. Callahan advised that Daly was upset that
the Committee had been so promptly advised for fear that we
would interupt the Bureau's inquiry. Callahan apologized for
the lack of responsiveness on.the part of Justice and the Bureau
but things are in disarray with Levi about to depart. I assured
Callahan we did not desire to interfere in the investigation
but desired to be promptly informed of any developments and
that we would stay in touch with Paul Daly in that regard .
Callahan promised to expedite any Committee requests as

made.

HW 50955, DocId:32423630 -Page 27


Paul Daly called at 3:10 p.m. to advise that "the powers
that be' at the Bureau were upset with the possibility that the
Committee was considering going to Dallas and interfering with
the investigation.. He specifically that the Director be given
an opportunity to talk with Inouye prior to any such action.

I told Daly that it was merely the Committee's desire to go
to Texas; I had heard no discussion of going regardless of
the Bureau's position. Daly promised to pull ‘together without
the need for a written request, :all available information on

Lamar Hunt observes
iat, since the bulk of H. L.

unt’s| estate was left to

rs. Hunt, “it was a natural

vn who looks after it.” La-

iar adds: “It does not mean

"Maxfield, who has been observing

}, the Hunts for nine years as Lamar’s

is an oft-delayed levian ahead for
Bunker and Herbert |Hunt on the wire-
tapping charges, but there is also the
threat of more indictments against
them by a federal grand jury that has
been sitting in Dallas for more than a
year, The Hunts claim their wiretap-
ping activities were) aimed at uncov-
ering suspected embezzlements from
their father’s food concern. In their
only statement on the matter, over a
year ago, they | cited “extensive, unex-
plained losses” suffered by the com-
pany, “We only sought|to protect our
father and his property; as any others
would have done,” they said.

But one of the wiretappers, Jon Jo-
seph Kelly, says that the tapping was
prompted by Bunke¥'s jand Herbert’s
suspicions that someone was trying to
influence H. L. Hunt/tolleave the bulk
of his estate to the ‘ech Mrs. Hunt
and her children. Three|of t the wiretap

tapers’ arrest and the| indictment of »
Herbert and Bunker on Feb. 28, 1973.
Hunt family lawyer t told Dallas Morn-
ing News investigativel reporter Earl
Golz that Bunker managed to strike a
bargain with the Justice Dept. in which
“there would be no prosecution of the
Hunts if they performed certain ac-
tions; they performed the actions, but
there was an indictment anyway.”

The actions, reportedly made after) _

1972 meetings with former President

Richard M. Nixon and former Attorney
General Richard Kleindienst, included
Bunker’s providing Justice with a list
of Al Fatah agents in the U.S. He had
secured the list privately because he ||’
feared he was on the Al Fatah death
list because of his Libyah holdings. . \*
For the Hunts, the wiretapping epi-
sode has proved disastrous. Bunker and
Herbert could receive prison sentences.
And, more than anything else in the,
family’s history, it has torn the tightly
woven curtain of secrecy behind which
the family has lived and worked for
more than four decades, oe

Jim Braden'sl true Identity fnerges

|
In early 1969, Peter Noyes, the investigative reporter
whose book covers much of the information regarding Jim
Braden, began investigating the mysterious California

"oil man. ‘i

i
Moyes oriqinally received a tip about Braden from a

former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney

Jim Garrison/'s investigation of the Kennedy assassination.
The FBI man itola Noyes of Braden's presence at the scene of
the assassination at the time of the shooting.

iloyes soon founda that Jim Braden was no longer at cither
of the addresses that he had given the Dallas police, and
had left no forwarding addresses. :

Noves then hia 1d the California Department of Motor Vehicles
run a check on the license number that Braden had given to
the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the
assassination. Notor Vehicles told Noyes that Braden'
license (751755) had been renewed by Braden in San Diego
county in November of 1966. Braden has also listed new
business and! home addresses, which interestingly were over
a hundred mijles apart.

The Department of Motor Vehicles' records on Jim Braden

also showed [that "Jim Braden" was not really his original

name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's

to Eugene tale Drading, which is Braden's true identity.
SEOs nee reneEEERIEOY TE eee ETRE

On September! 10, 1963, just ten weeks before the assassination,
“Nugene Yale |Brading had notified the Départment that he had
legally changed his name to Jim Braden, and he requested a
new license junder that name. The license was granted,

Intrigued by, the fact that Jim Braden was really a.false
identity assumed by Bugene Brading, investigator. Noyes
contacted the Intelligence Division of the California
Attorney General's Office, and had a check run on the.

mysterious Brading.

Noves was told that Eugene Hale Brading “is a real bad guy.
He's got a tong rap sheet and apparantly has Mafia connections."

Yoyes shortly thereafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's
(Jim Braden"s) police records.

The Brading) "rap sheet" contained an incredible 35
seperate entries covering virtually every phase of
criminal activity, including mail fraud, embezzlement,

Sugene Hale: Rrading, but the police dossier on him also
showed a fhandful of other aliases, including Harry Eugene
Bradley, |Gene Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,
and inevitably, Jin Braden. !

"Tin Braden" was the last entry shown on Brading's
records.

Pied areg Wh pe aloa iad Noyes found that due to. the fact
that the aillas police had not fingerprinted Jim Braden or
run a mais on him, his true identity of gene’ Brading was
never discovered by the FBI or the flarren Commission at the
time of their investigation of the assassination. The Warren

and Gene Smaldone,

DocId: 32423630 i 38 i


‘the Smaldone brothers, who were also known as Checkers
and Flin Flon, were the Mafia leaders in charge of the
syndicate!s vending-ma xchine market which stretched from

the Rockies all the way to Chicago. Police records show
that at one, time, the Smaldones virtually controlled the
entire Pueblo arca of Colorado.

The Smaldone brothers were notorious for the brutal brand

of violenee they practiced in their operations), Brading
(Braden) became involved in ma ny transactions with the
Smaldones| and became a clos rsonal friend, Several years
later, after Prading finally went to jail. for the enbezzlement
of the Texas widow, the Smaldone brothers regularly wrote

to hin in| prison, Seeking his advice on various financial
matters, |

(BRADING AND) CLARK AND BAUIMAIT)
|

Brading and his & friend Pereira later moved to Beverly Hills
in California, Shortly thereafter, Brading inevitably came
under investiaation by the Los Angeles Police Department
Intelligence Division's Mafia specialists.
In particu: the LAPD interest in Brading was focused on
his close) association in Beverly Hills with two “oil specu-
lators" from Miami, Arthur. Clark and Roger Bauman. Clark
and Baumam were notorious Mafia figures with long police

records. | | |

Brading's|friend Clark had been one of the ton] leaders of
the famous Purple Gang of the Mafia, which hadjonerated
out of Dek troit and Youngstown. The Los Anaeles| police had
nlaced Clark and Bauman under tight surveillance and had
compiled extensive information on their friendship with
Brading. |
a

In. 1956, the Chief of Intelligence of the LAPD) Captain
James Nanilton, sent a letter to the Crime Commission qf
Greater Miami Seeking information about Clark,| Bauman, and

Brading.

Captain Hamilton, who was known as one of the foremost

experts on the Nafia in the nation, asked the Niami Commission
(which was conducting extensive investigations of the Nafia)
to infornjhim as to the involvement of several] associates of
Clark and} Bauman, '

Among those named was Eugene Brading.

|. z i
HW 50955 DocId: 32423630 | Page 39


Captain Hamilton's letter stated:

“hig Department has under investigation Arthur

Lewis Clark, Sr., FBI 3709258, anda Roger Bauman.
These men are representing thenselves as officials
of the! Sunbeam O31 Company, 212 Roosevelt] Theater
Building, Hiami Beach, and both are spending money
very lavishly."

"Clark. has been arrested several times and has been
i : 1
asso¢iated with many confidence men and hoodlums such
as James Fratianno, Victor Pereira, Bugeno Brading,
Clarence Rhodes, stephen Sambor and the Siraldone
¢ oiharcone
brothers of Denver.

As investigator Peter ifoves points out, the men listed
with Brading in the letter, represent a virtual “Who's Who"
of organized crime leaders between California and’ the Midwest.

i :
(BRADING ano! PRATIAWNO)

Of these bob Mafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhaps
the most ortant one is James Fratianno, also widely known
as “Jimmie The Weasel." Pratianno was known as|perhaps the
Mafia's highest ranking executioner in the nation,

In 195 jnjna s testimony before the Rackets chanittes of
the Caliedenia legislature, Captain Hamilton, the Chief of
LAPD Intelligence, stated that,

"ile Haye; Long considered Fratianno to
be the| executioner for the HNafia on
the West: Coast."

Captain eee told the Rackets Committee that his Intelligence
Division had linked Jimmie Fratianno to at least sixteen Mafia
executi 7 H
Fratiannojhad once been arrested for the attempted assassination
of Los Angelos Mafia head Nickey Cohen in 1949} Cohen -had
survived the bloody shooting which took the life of one of
his lieutenants, Fratianno was later released due to insuf-
ficient evidence, Fratianno used the alibi that he had been
at the home of Mafia associate Nick Licata the night of the
shooting. [Licata later Jecame the. new head of the Los Angeles
Mafia, and, perhaps significantly, was later given control of

LIEBENGOOD ROUTH NOTES, FROM U. S. V. VECIANA, ET AL

DATE: December oh 1976

Veciana was represented by Barry L. Garber, 1040 City National
Bank Building, 25 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida 33130
(305-377- 4963)

Veciana became implicated as the result ofja drug bust
of one Augustine Barres, a/k/a/ Emidigio Augustine Barres Fangul
("Gus Barres"). The bust resulted from an search warrant of
23 July 73 for Barres' attache case at the Taft |Hotel in New
York, The police were acting on an informant tip to an under-
cover agent who arranged for a buy from Barres of seven kilograms
of Cocaine at the Taft. The police understood that Barres was to
be with a "female" courier. Barres advised DEA task force re-
presentative, Eugene W. Flynn, a detective sgt. with the NYPD,
that he purchased the seven kilos from Antonio Veciana in Miami
on July 21, 1973. iy

ll
Barres owns a home in Puerto Rico and travels to New York

every two weeks on business. i

|
A co-defendant of Veciana's in the case wall Ariel Pomares
who is the President of Occidental Investment, al real estate
firm owned by Barres, located at 1186 J. T. Pinero Avenue,
Miami. Pomares is also involved with FRECA Imports in Puerto
Rico. This.is also a Barres enterprise.
: i

The DEA Miami regional office cables that Wectana is the
subject of INS File No. Al12-490987 and that he claims to be a
public accountant. \

According to the Miami Herald of July 25, (1973, Barres was
Assistant Secretary of Communications under Casitro and later the
general manager of the Havana Health Department: He fled Cuba
in 1961 for asylum in Puerto Rico. He became a'{United States
citizen in 1970. :

A cable from Ivan Wurms, the Chief Investigator of the DEA
Task Force to Durkin at DEA headquarters, Washington, states that
Veciana was arrested without incident on 7/24/73 and signed a

"consent to search" form. Miscellaneous papers [and numerous

foreign passports belonging to several subjects were seized.
Swiss bank account deposit slips were seized and! are to be
followed by IRS. Veciana claims to be an anti-Castro fund
raiser. FBI confirms this. ;

i
i

A July, 1973 TWIX from DEA in New York to DEA headquarters
Washington (attention: Daniel P. Casey, Acting Chief) referenced
as subject: G1-73-X093 (presumably Veciana) and| states "during
debriefing of the defendant in New York on July 25, 1973, it was
learned that Antonio Carlos Veciana, 811 North Southwest 30th
Court, Miami is a member of an anti-Castro group! which he has
stated intends to blow up a number of Cuban properties and/or
embassies in foreign nations, i.e., Spain, Mexico, Peru and France.
Bombings originally scheduled for July now delayed until August."

i \

Subpoena of August 14, 1973 exists for a telegram billed to

Veciana at 649-1226 and sent to Barcelona, Spain on 5/26/73.

Barres implicates a Paraguyan diplomat formerly assigned
to LaPaz, Bolivia and reassigned to Spain in the drug traffic.
DEA is discretely checking his identity. A follow-up cable
from DEA indicates that they have failed to identify the Paraguyan
diplomat sent to Spain but do indicate that a Pedro P. Medina,
a Paraguyan assigned to LaPaz, is believed to be involved in
Cocaine smuggling. i |
! af
Barres admitted that he was responsible for bringing Pomares,
an employee of his, into illegal drug activity. |

Vecjana' claimed to be without funds and destitute and was
not fined. The U. S. Attorney was concerned that he posted a
$100,000 baill!immediately. However, after initial concern being
shown in the file by the U. S. Attorney, the U.|S. Attorney later
writes the Judge that: $80,000 of the $100,000 bond was furnished
by Veciana's cousin, Dr. PMeblo Zalduendo, a phyéian from Detroit,
Michigan. The remainder of the bail money was ‘furnished by Veciana's
uncle and other family members and friends who cashed insurance
policies, closed children's savings accounts, etc. U. S. Attorney
concluded that Veciana was possibly telling the{truth when he advised
the Court that he was destitute.

Barres says he requested the government to give immunity to
Veciana in order to destroy the traffic of Cocaine from Bolivia.
i

a]
Barres studied at Columbia Military Academy, in Columbia,
Tennessee |in 1951. : i

A taped transcript of Barres' debriefing by, detectives
Flynn and|Scamardella on July 25, 1973 reveals the following:
Barres got involved in drugs through his friendVeciana who was
an officer of the International Development Bank in the U.S.
Embassy in Bolivia. Some people think Veciana is with the CIA
but Barres does not know, Barres dealt with Veciana regarding
an attempt to kill Castro in Chile. He says Veciana did a good
job of transferring everything into Chile (197031971) . Barres
gave Veciana $2,000 in support of this assassination effort.
About this time Veciana said that drugs could be smuggled out of
Bolivia through diplomatic pouch. Barres thought this was how
Veciana had sent weapons into Chile. Barres advised that the head
of Interpol in Bolivia gets a cut of drug money|for protection on
the Bolivian end and jthat a Secret Service Agent and two Paraguyan
diplomats| were also involved. They handled the! transfer to
Veciana in Miami Beach of the drugs from Bolivia.

Barres thought that the individual he was ‘selling the drugs
to in New York was a mafia type. It appears this is the indi-
vidual who informed the police. He is known only as Tony in the
transcript. The police were aware of his identity but did not
desire Barres to discuss it.

Pomares' counsel, Gustavo Del Toro, urged the DEA in San
Juan at the time of the arrest of Pomares to consider immunity
for Pomaties because Pomares possessed valuable jinformation re~
garding international narcotic trafficing, including the impli-
cation of diplomats in places such as Bolivia, Paraguay and

Nicaragua. :

The |file contains cancelled Veciana checks drawn on the
account of Antonio Sira Veciana at the Fidelity, National Bank,
5880 Byrd Road, Miami, Florida,.in May and June, 1972, for $1,000
each, payable to the Swiss Bank Corporation foy account EF558230.
These checks were obtained through subpoena on /Catherine Hune,
Vice President and Cashier of the Fidelity National Bank in Miami.

FROM: Tom Moore

DATE: Jan. 3, 1977 | i

Telephoned Veciana to ask if he recalled any jattempts on

his life in late 1962 or 1963. He answered that. there were

three attempts on his life, tut none in 1962 or 11963. The

it
first attempt, he said; occurred in a stadium in’ Puerto
: |
i

Rico in 1967 when a bomb exploded approximately 20 meters

away. He said he believed Puerto Rican communists were

responsible for this attempt. The second attempt) occurred

in Bolivia in approximately 1970 when some men with weapons

appeared at a home where he was supposed to be. . He said a

woman who owned the home called him to warn him. | He said

he thought this attempt was related to a revolution which

was taking Place at that time. The third attempt), he said,
occurred in Caracas, Venezuela in 1971. He added) that he had

I. Carry-over from Church report

A. Relationship between agencies and Warren Commission

L. Warren Comm, staff has never been interviewed in
depth. Many have not been interviewed at all. The
Commission had: particular staff assigned to (a) Cuba
and (b) organized crime. They, especially, should be
fully debriefed about everything that happened in their
contacts with the agencies, their frustrations, unful-
filled leads, inability to get access, questionmarks,
and what they knew, heard, or suspected about contacts
at high- level bewween Commission members and top agency
officials. This would include leads to additional
documents, memoranda and people, and is especially
important in the time-frame just before the Commission
issued its report, i.e. as final drafts being written,
when staff learned for the first time about Castro's
threat. (Willens, staff director, said there were staff
pushing hard to re-open this subject, but pressure of
getting the report out prevailed.)

2, Look for all other memoranda of contacts between
McCone and CIA re how to structure questions, etc.

3. We now know, that Ruby was contacted svereal times
by FBI to inform on axganxzedxexxmexxnxRatiaxxaxeax
A" criminal element” in Dallas area. All we've seen
is the cummary.memo in which Warfen Commission was
so'informed. Get each memorandum of contact between
FBI agents and. Ruby, i.e, underlying materials which
"support" the summary memo.

B. The inter-agency committee which met to develop

1. “Numerous documents were sought from FBI, CIA,
Defense, State, etc., but never received by Church
Committee before our final report was issued. Must
follow-through, and then go deeper into it.

2. What else was known besides Castro's retaliation
threat? What facts went into the assessment that
Castro might retaliate against U.S. leaders in Latin
America, but not U.S. leaders in the U.S.? Precisely
what accounted for the/# original inclusion of
a concern about retaliation in the U.S., but the sub-
sequent deletion of that prospect? Who was responsible
for the deletion, and what impact, if any, did that
have on the later ¢#% withholding of info’ ‘from. the
Warren Commission and on the agencies' oe to
bie ead retaliation? Fi
3, We} must find out exactly who was on this Committee
at each meeting, get all back-up materials, and interview.

As Church report was being completed, we were just

l.
involved in U.S. anti-Castro action. Possibility
here|that #4 this could provide another clue in re
FBI''s original: reluctance to investigate retaliation
For instance we now know that FBI had

crime to kill: Castro long before RFK toldx#sanyx

Hoover about it (Hoover had professed surprise in

1963x, but there's some indication he may have already
known) . One FBI witness even told us that a high FBI

of fic ial a had! even proposed the plot idea "in jest".

At a/minimum, ‘the paper record shows FBI wasxeankacked
koxproxvidexubanxincettx informed about idea of using
org|.:crime figures to provide Cuban intelligence and
that} according to the paper record, FBI recommended
against it. Trafficante has now claimed that FBI agents
came | to him seeking Cuban intellignce. This must be
followed up, agents interviewed, and FBI memo's,etc.,
examined. ut

D. CIA files il

i always had the impression that Jim Johnston felt
there were more CIA documents which he hadn't seen.
We mast go over the itmes, one by one, with Johnston,
to find out just where we stand on the question of
whether or ¢ not weve seen everything. Do any of us
really fully understand the entire CIA filing system
so as to know ‘whether we've¥ been shown everything, or
indeed , whether they have even Ag g-ne looking for

‘of CIA documents presented the SCI by

Subject: Review pack Anderson

The documents recently received by this Committee, from Jack
Anderson, had previously been reviewed by the Church Committee staff,
The documents appear to be a few of those requested for FOIA review
by David Belin. It is my understanding, after these documents were
declassified, David Belin furnished copies to both David Martin (AP)
and Jack Anderson!

The Church Committee was permitted to review the ‘entire Oswald
201 file, the AMLASH file, Garrison files and selected| Office of
Security files. The Committee primarily concerned itself with the
early period of the investigation (November 1963 - October 1964), as
it believed the information to be received from this time period
to be more relevant in evaluating the performance of ‘the intelligence
agencies with respect to their investigation.

Dan Niescher|, lthe Church Committee contact at the CIA,was the
individual responsible for the declassification of documents
relating to the | assassination of President Kennedy. During this
declassification process, Dan Niescher consulted the Committee staff
to make sure that we were aware of certain documents, In addition,
Mr. Kaleras had [given the staff unlimited access to all files we
believed necessary to conduct our investigation.

Yet, the possibility still remains that. the staff. was not

201 file was a complete compilation of the material related to the

. Rosselii’s disappearance. a soure!

’Traffican

te Made Secret Appearance

At Senate Investigation, Sources Say

By RON LaBRECQUE
Herald Statt Writer

Florida’s reputed . organized
‘crime boss, Santos Trafficante of
Tampa and Miami, made a secret,
* four-hour October appearance be-
fore the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee. to answer questions about
his cole in a CIA assassination plot,
investigation sources have dis-
closed. .

Trafficante, 62, had not previ-
ously been questioned by the com-
mittee or its staff in the two-year-
old investigation of CIA activities.

Of the three Mafia figures in-
volved im the early 1960s plot to
kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro,
only Trafficante is still alive. Both
Sam Giancana and John Rosselli

“were murdered within the last 16

months.
The murders are unsolved,

INVESTIGATORS ALSO said y

that Trafficante had dinner with
Rosselli at The Landings, a Fort
Lauderdale restaurant, in mid-July,

- less than two weeks before Rossel-

li disappeared. Rosselli’s body,
stuffed in.an oil drum, floated to
the surface of Dumfoundling Bay
the first week of August.
Trafficante reportedly has told
police that the July dinner with
Rosselli -+ as well as several other
meetings previously at the Cordoba
Restaurant in Miami. formerly
owned by the husband of Rosselli’s
niece, according to police — were
“friendly, social events with no
business." .

Investigators in recent weeks’

have centered their efforts on trac-
ing the whereabouts of Traffi-
cante’s associates at the time of,

Trafficante was identified as the
head of a South Florida Mafia fam-

‘tly in testimony in 1963 before a

US. Senate subcommittee. ne)

His ATTORNEY, Henry Gonza-
lez of Tampa, ‘who accompanied
Trafficante when he went to
Washington, according to sourees,
would not comment on either the
Senate appearance or Trafficante’s
past activities. When first asked
about the Senate appearance, he
said, “You realize you're treading

‘rafficante had not been ques-
tioned previously by the committee
because his role in the plot -had
ered “secondary.”
Interest was Tél
after Rosselli’s death. Investigators

A committee source said. that]:

sought to determine whether the
murders of the two men were con-
nected in any way. with their testi-
mony or potential ‘testimony before,

. the committee.

GIANCANA, WHO was a Mafia:
boss in Chicago for many vears,
was killed in June 1975. at the
same time Senate investigators
were preparing to contact him. The
gun used to kill Giancana, found .
discarded om a roadside several
miles from Giancana’s house a
month after the murder, was
traced toa Miami gunshop, but the
trail stopped’ there.

Investigators said the gun was
part of a shipment purchased in
1965 by the Tamiami Gun Shop,
but there are no records to indicate
where it went from there, accord-
ing to investigators and gunshop
owners. .

Rosselli, whose most powerful
Mafia days were reportedly in the
1950s and early 1960s in Las Vegas
and Los Angeles, did appear before
the committee at least three times
in the 12 months before his death.

In’ Washington, the committee
has. kept a tight clamp on comment
about the investigation, and only
one member, Robert T. Stafford
(R., Vt.), acknowledged the Traffi-
cante session, saying “I was not
present when the witness you
speak of was in front of the com-
mittee.”

- Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii),
the committee chairman who,
along with Sen. Howard Baker (R.,
Tenn.) pressured for Justice De-
partment and FBY involvement in
the Rosselli murder case, said “I
have never met Mr. Trafficante.
That's as far as PU go.”

, A PRIME interest of the commit-
tee has been possible links between

the CTA Castro plotting and the age
sassination ef John F. Kennedy.
Revelations of the Senate commit-
tee were a key factor in the cree
ation of the new House of Repre-
sentative investigation, which is
taking a new look at the JFK mre
der.

Trafficante reportedly has told
investigators that he first met Rose
selli about 1956. It was in the early
1950s that Florida law- enforce-
ment officials estimated that a Boe
lita opertion run by Trafficante and
his brother netted $2 million annu-
ally.

Trafficante was a major gate.
bling figure in pbre-Castro Havana,
where he ran a casino. In 1959, ft
was estimated that $1 million of $2
million was bet nightly in all the
Mafia-run casinos in Havana. The
gambling stopped when Castro
took over in 1959.

Rosselli was. the first of the
three Mafia figures to be recruited
by the CIA in 1960 in its plot t to as»
sassinate Castro.

IN A CIA memo quoted ta ent

terim report of the committee @
year ago, it was said that Traffe

cante’s role was to “serve a$ a cote —

rier to Cuba and make arranges
ments there.”

Rosselli told his CIA Ilaison that
“Trafficante believed a certain
leading figure in the Cuban exile
movement might be able to accome
Pplish the assassination.” An inter-
nal ‘CIA ‘investigation in 1967 “suge
gests that this Cuban may have
been receiving funds from Traffi-
cante and other racketeers interest-
ed in securing ‘gambling, prostitn-
tion and dope monopolies’ in Cuba
after the overthrow of Castro.”

We spoke to John McCone,
who headed the CIA at the
time of the assassination at-

idea had becn discussed inside

that the CIA had ever partici-
pated in any plot on Castro’s

“ltempts could. have been made

plied: “It could not have hap-

The headless, ‘handless body that
floated into a Miami|canal last month
reminded Minnium of that other, simi-
larly mutilated body that turned up
last December. And| who .can forget

mate, sliced him up and tassed the

Minnium is not pleased by such vio-
lent antics.

“We |don’t: appreciate people com-
mitting murder and dumping a body

people are, but especially if it’s organ-
ized crime,” Minnium says.

That Johnny Rosell was destined to
walk on the dark side of life never
seemed|in doubt. As a teen- -ager in Bos-
ton, when his name was Filippo Sacco,
Roselli's [was arunner for the ‘numbers

down his home for the insurance mon-
ey. He was arrested at age 22 for steal-
ing abot $25 from someone. Then he
changed his name and left for Chica-

It would be 40 years until, in the late
1960s, Johnny Roselli would see his
mother/again, though he sent money
to his family through an intermediary
in Chicago 50 his sisters could attend
college. |

By the late 1920s Al Capone was well
established in Chicago. Newspaper-
men, politicians and cops were on the
Capone} ‘payroll and a young man with
Roselli’s|street savvy had little trouble
finding Suitable employment; he hired
on as a\lrumrunner with the Capone
gang. At age 26 Roselli was arrested
for selling morphine to an undercover
agent. He was acquitted because, after
Roselli’s|arrest, no one could seem to

Cohn magnanimously tore up the in-

Roselli bought twin star rubies, had
them set in jrings and gave one to
Cohn, who considered it a good luck
charm until his death. Once, when Chi-
cago mobster Willie Bioff moved to
Hollywood and began making life mi-
serable for movie studios by shaking
down executives in return for labor
peace, Roselli stepped in and saved
Cohn from a lengthy strike.

When Cohn refused to pay tribute to
Bioff and his union, Bioff tried to halt
production at Columbia by calling a
sudden strike! Desperate, Cohn called
Roselli who marched into Bioff’s office
and: confronted the hoodlum who sat
behind his desk wearing a hat and
coat, chomping on a cigar, a gun rest-
ing on the desk in front of him.

“Listen, Willie, I don’t know what
you're trying to prove but it isn’t going

spite thing and you're not going to get
away with it. You meet with Cohn and

Bioff backed down and called off his

tortion, Bioff|cut a deal with the gov-
ernment and |named Roselli as a ‘Chi-
cago mobster who had helped ‘him
shake down movie studios. Cohn testi-
fied on Roselli’s behalf, but in 1943 Ro-
’'selli was senténced to 10 years in pris-
on. When he/got out he returned to
Hollywood to make pictures of prison
and gangster life, But publicity about a
secret appearance before the Kefau-
ver crime committee ruined his rela-
tionship with most studios. Even Cohn
re fused to hire him—“The stockhold-
, efs would scalp me,” Cohn told a bitter
Roselli.

Tt was during his years in the Los
Angeles and Las Vegas areas that Ro-
selli met the lman who would make
him a household name later in. life.
Robert Maheu! the ex-FBI agent who
parlayed a Washington private’ eye
business into a stormy career as How-
ard Hughes’ ian in Las Vegas, ap-

proached Roselli on behalf of the CIA
in 1960.

(Another person Roselli met in that
era who would later surface to talk of
Roselli, Giancana and John F. Ken-
nedy wasa young party girl named Ju-
dith Campbell.) ti

Maheu and Roselli would later tell
Frank Church's Senate Intelligence
Committee theldetails of their plots to
Kill Castro. Mahieu told investigators he
had known Roselli since the late 1950s
and, white he didn’t know of his, un-
derworld connections, “it was ‘cer-
tainly evident to me that (Roselli) was
able to accomplish things in Las Vegas
when nobody else seemed to get the
same kind of attention.”

Over dinner at the Brown Derby in
Beverly Hills 16 years ago, Maheu ex-
plained to Roselli that his government
needed his services, Roselli, who was
born on July 4, 1905, was nothing if not
patriotic. (Sam) Giancana once said,
“Just wave a flag and Johnny'll follow
you to any canal.”) Maheu recalled that

said another of Roselli’s brothers-in-
law, Peter Cardillo of New Jersey.

The public doesn’t. know what Ma-
heu is thinking, whether he worries if
pro-Castro Cubans are exacting retri-
bution for sins of 16 yeats ago. Maheu’s
secretary in Las Vegas says she doesn’t
know where her boss is or when he'll
be returning to his office. He report-
edly has some business interest in
Egypt, a part of the World that seems
to hold some fascination for the Castro
lotters; Giancana kept an apartment

retribution for a public or a private

glamor of Hollywood, Las Vegas and,

The {ashington Post

AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER

. . Who Killed John Roselli?

ERE GOING TO tell you a little story now.

Once there was a President who was murdered.
His brother was murdered too. A long time after they
died some very strange facts came to light. It turned
out that while they were running the government,
the government was trying to get two Mafia mobsters
to arrange the murder of someone else—the head of
a small, hostile neighbor state. It also turned out that
one brother—the one who was President—appar-
ently had a girlfriend who was the girlfriend as well
of the mobsters. And one of the mobsters, whose
nickname was Momo, was prominent on the list of
criminals the President's brother was trying to put in
jail. The story may sound complicated, but life is com-
plicated, azd the complications in this case got even
more so. For when a committee of the Congress
wanted the two mobsters to come and tell them some-
thing about all this, only one of them—the one
named Johnny— came. The other one, Momo, was
murdered in his house a week before they wanted
him to testify. Johnny, however, told his story to one
committee in the Congress and then came back—qui-
etly—to tell some more things to another committee
which was in fact looking into the murder of the
President. Then Johnny went to Florida. Then no one
could find him. Then some fishermen found him,
Dead. In an oil drum.

But we haven't told you the strangest part of all
yet, the part you're really not going to believe. It is
that when the great national political community of
solons, scribes, policemen, spies and managers of the
general: wellbeing heard about poor Johnny, they
said: "Oh, my goodness.” Some of them went farther,
of course. They said: “Fancy that!” But most of them
didn’t say anything at all except: “Yawn.”

Forgive us for lapsing into storybookese. We do it
for a reason which Is that the simple unadorned facts
of the John and Robert Kennedy-Fidel Castro-CIA-
Mafia-Momo GiancanaJohnny RoselliJudith Exner:
Church CommitteeSchweiker Committee saga need
to be put forward in stark outline for their magni-
tude to be understood. Is it really, as the sophisticated
wisdom goes, “paranoid” on our part to brood about
the suggestive and possibly monstrous interconnec-
tions between all these facts and to wonder why they
are not the object of intense press and government

= scrutiny? What accounts for the general indifference

in high places? What accounts for the eagerness with
which we all seem to accept that familiar tipoff that
we shall be hearing no more about the latest crime—
i.e., the pronouncement that Mr. Roselli’s dispatch 1
an oil drum and Beyond had “all the earmarks of a
gangland slaying.” Those are the good old “ear-

- marks” we only hear about when jt is next to.certain,. +

that we shail hear nothing more. *

‘The supposition of course is that the Gang which
runs gangland has its reasons and its methods and
that, disagreeable as these may be, they really lie out:
side the proper realm of public concern because they

amount to a system of justice which 1) only affects
those dumb enough to get involved in it in the first
place and 2) tends only to punish those who have
committed what the rest of us would regard as hei-
nous crimes anyway. Not that these are things people
say—they're things people can be expected to as-
sume. But we think in this case the assumptions have
even less validity than they would have on a clear
day, which isn't much. And that is because if we
know anything, we know that the Mafia operations in
which Messers. Giancana and Roselli figured had be-
come intertwined with the operations of the United
States government. Never mind that the decisions of
the early 1960s which made this so may rank among
the most abominable decisions ever taken in the US.
government. The plain fact is that, given the provoca-
tive and suggestive history of the two men, it is not
possible for either Congress or the Executive Branch
to look the other way or to complaisantly accept the
earmarksof-a-gangland-slaying bromide.

After Mr. Giancana was killed, the Church Commit-
tee inquired of the FBI whether its proposed meeting
with him had figured in his murder. The FBI re- .

ported that it had no evidence to this effect. The
then-director of the CIA, William Colby, felt obliged |
to state that the CIA had had nothing to do with the
murder—and Mr. Colby likewise pronounced the
other day that he was certain the CIA had not done in
Mr. Roselli. The mere fact that the questions, to |
which these were meant to be the answers, had been
raised tells us, anyway, that much more in the way of
inquiry is wanted. The newly formed Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence has now asked the Justice
Department to make an investigation of Mr. Roselli's
death. We think the Department should comply and
that the investigation, despite FBI Director Clarence
Kelley's disclaimer of jurisdiction, should have the
‘ttorney General's personal attention. Such: atten-
ion is needed because of the elaborate and not en-
tirely reassuring history of relationships between the
FBI and the CIA and the various participants in the
whole sorry saga. We are not, suggesting’ that any
agency of government—or even any of those agen-
cy's fringe retainers —were the murderers. We are
suggesting that there is an overlay of potentially em
barrassing information sufficiently pervasive to keep

an awful lot of: people from wanting to have this |
thing aired. We also think that the Select Committee
should reserve the right to pursue the matter. Con-
gress, after all, can hardly be expected to sit idly by
while its witnesses are being done in. Nor do we see . |
how the public in general and the political establish:
ment in particular can turn their attention away un-;\.
ti we are all satisfied that a much greater effort has
been made by the government—which means both
the Executive Branch and the Congress—to discover
what elements were at play in this series of appalling
crimes and scandal

The Data From


ROSSELLI_ CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

1955 Meets Maheu at insurance friend's home.

1960 Late July/early August. Maheu calls. Working for government. Recruit
Rosselli only. Meet Brown Derby, L.A., for lunch. Long talk about
project in Cuba. Rosselli wants verification.

2nd meeting, L.A., discuss further details, no discussion of specific
techniques. Plan to meet in N.Y. for verification.

Sept. 14, 1960. First meeting in N.Y. at old Plaza Hotel. Rosselli
introduced by Maheu to O'Connell. Rosselli "knew" O'Connell worked
for the CIA. Rosselli agrees to work on Cuban project.

Sept. 25, 1960. Maheu and Rosselli travel to Miami to begin making
contact with Cubans to be recruited for mission.

(Between Sept. 25 and the Bay of Pigs, a series of recruitments, meetings,
and arrangements were made. The following is an outline of events that
is not necessarily in chronological order.)

.
-- Meeting where Maheu is introduced to Trafficantp. Meeting
where Maheu is introduced to Giancana. Giancana was, according
to Rosselli, to only be a "back up man." Rosselli states .
Giancana had nothing to do with the actual operation. Trafficante
was used, according to Rosselli, as a translator.

-- Meeting with O'Connell, Maheu, Rosselli, Sad tye iderxgls-te==

discuss the Cuban project.

-- Rosselli, in his contact with the Cubans, "invents" the cover
story that he represents some Wall Street business interests who
want to see Castro eliminated. Rosselli trusts Cubans he has
recruited because they are part of the Bay of Pigs operation.

-- lst attempt at assassination involved the use of pills. Maheu ~
and Rosselli met with Cuban #1 and #2 (?). Maheu opened up his
briefcase and gave the pills with instructions for their use to
Cuban #1, Maheu also had $10,000 he gave the Cubans for doing
the project. Rosselli did not know of the money. Rosselli states
he received no remuneration for his work on the project, in fact,
he paid out $800 for gas for a speed boat to deliver two or three
man parties for guerrilla raids into Cuba.

-- Prior to Bay of Pigs there was no rae of using guns to
assassinate Castro.

-- Rosselli's cover name was 'John Ralston."

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 119


-- At different times, Cuban #1, #2, or #3 would propose different
projects, These would range from using plastic explosives to
booby trapping Castro's desk. Rosselli would relay these on
to Maheu, who, in turn, would contact the CIA. Most projects
were vetoed, but the CIA did supply a short wave radio to the
Cubans in Florida, to try and make contact with their people
in Havana.

pei Eventually, Rosselli felt the project had failed. There was no

specific point when it was announced. But, at sometime Rosselli
assumed the project, for whatever reason, had not succeeded.

After the| |
Rosselli felt ;" (sorry for the poor bastards. deft on the

ths sin ag _

pate_in the-tnuasioa_ Two or three weeks lafter the
invasion, | Rosselli was contacted in Los |Angeles by
O'Connell, a meeting was arranged for at the airport
hotel in Miami, Rosselli went there and was introduced
to Harvey: O'Connell said Harvey was now lin charge of
the Cuban| project. Harvey told Rosselli he was to cease
all contact with Maheu and Giancana. Further, Harvey
stated that the government was still interested in using
Rosselli for intelligence-gathering operations. Rosselli
would report information from the Cubans to Harvey about
personalities and events in Cuba. Rosselli would also
relay on to his Cuban contacts requests! for specific in-
formation) from the CIA. q q

Sometime between the Bay of Pigs invasi¢n|and the Cuban
missile crisis, Harvey gave Rosselli six poison capsules.
Rosselli,|in turn, gave them to his Cuban|‘contacts who
were to take them to Cuba, where another Cuban or Cubans
would use| them to assassinate Castro. Rosselli never
learned the details of what happened, but| the praject ob-
viously failed. At one point, Rosselli |renenbers hearing
over the radio that Castro was very ill: i short time

later, he} recovered. :
Sometime before the missile crisis, Rosdelli arranged,
pursuant to Cuban #1 request, for a van| 1gaded with rifles
and ammunition to be delivered in Florida: O'Connell and
Rosselli watched the Cuban contact pick) up ithe van and
return it} empty. Rosselli assumed that these guns were
going to be used by the two or three-man raiding parties
in Cuba to assassinate Castro and Mine © the government.
During the Cuban missile crisis, Rosselli Iwas in Chicago.
He contacted Harvey at Harvey's mother’ 8 home in Indian-
apolis and left his number in Chicago. ; Harvey then called
him, told him to go to Washington, D.C.} From Washington,
D.C., Rosselli traveled to Florida where he stayed for
the duration of the Cuban missile crisis.| ‘He, at times,
would, through his Cuban contacts, attempt to verify the
location of the Russian missiles in Cuba. | }Rosselli claimed
that this had been successful. After the] Cuban missile

Rowan Tap) |
Rosselli said that he understood that Giant
asked Maheu for.a tap on Dan Rowan. Maheu: gave
Rosselli two stories. The first was that|he was
doing Giancana a favor and the second was| that there
was a real intelligence value in that Maheu was
afraid that Giancana or Rowan might be giving out
intelligence information that would be of value to
enemies of the United States. Rosselli/had not heard
of the names Dubois or Belotti or Fred Harrison. He
admitted that Harvey had discussed the tap with him,
but both Harvey and Rosselli were mad that the opera-
tion had gone'on. Giancana obviously knew about the
tap. Maheu did ask Rosselli to get bail money for
the two tappers who were caught and thrown in jail.
Maheu suggested that Rosselli could get a; hotel to
turn over| the. bail money. Finally, Rosselli arranged

From: i Rick |
Date: : August 10, 1976 i
Subject: Roselli

First, some background information. Yesterday,

August 9} Senators Inouye and Baker met with Directors

|
Kelley and ‘Bush to discuss Roselli's death. The FBI

doesn't want to touch this with a ten-foot pole. | At the
j

meeting, |Jim Adams told Inouye and Baker that the} FBI had
been told by Justice (Richard Thornburg) that it had no
jurisdiction in this case. Levi had, apparently,| not been

consulted. Senators Baker and Inouye (especially) Baker)

requested Kelley to take this up directly with Levi. Today,
a letter/was sent to Levi, signed by ;Baker and Inouye, urg-
ing Justice to authorize FBI involvement. A copy, of that

letter is attached.
|

One other point about the meeting. George Bush was

extremely upset about fhis case ‘and the allegations that
|

the CIA was involved in Roselli's death. He said: that he

would personally contact Levi to request that the Depart-

ment grant jurisdiction to the FBI 6 investigate,

For your information, Roselli appeared before the

Committee on four separate occasions to testify on three

John Whitten, charged with investigating
the assassination. On November 24,
Mexico City cabled the names of known
contacts of Soviet personnel in Mexico

was included on that list. Nonetheless
neither Fitzgerald, Helms, Tom K or

significance of this name.

Headquarters asked the Mexico Station

to stop the planned arrest of Sylvia

was because CIA feared Cuba responsible
for assassination.

Headquarters equally concerned with
Duran on November 27 and warned

hard.

that a Cubana airlines flight to Havana
was delayed in Mexico City on November 22

This cable was found in Mexico City

In December, 1963, Sullivan prepared a

President that stated that no evidence
had been developed which would indicate
Oswald's assassination was inspired or
directed by Pro Castro organizations
or by any foreign country.

FBI Headquarters on November 24
that U.S. Ambassador felt Cubans
participated in assassination
effort. "Bureau may desire’ to
give consideration to polling

The CIA investigation reflected a
Soviet orientation, with exhaustive
studies of Oswald's activities in

re Soviet Union, There is no corres-
ponding CIA analysis of Oswald's con-
tacts with pro and anti Castro groups
in U.S. :


Boole V, p. 61- In December, 1963, the CIA learned that

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 165

a Cuban American had crossed the border
from Texas into Mexico, on November 23

and arrived in Mexico City on November 25.
He stayed in a hotel until the evening of
November 27, when he departed on a
regularly scheduled Cubana airlines flight
to Havana using a Cuban courtesy visa and
an expired U.S. passport. He was the only
passenger on the flight. In March, 1964
the Agency received a report from a

source which alleged that the same Cuban
American had received a permit to enter
Mexico City on November 20 in Tampa,
Florida. The same source said the Cuban
American was somehow involved in the
assassination.

The Agency did not follow up on this
report other than to ask a Cuban
defector about his knowledge of the
Cuban American's activities. The FBI
did investigate the reported unusual
travel but did not fully report the
results of their investigation to their
Warren Commission. Their investigation
showed that this individual had lived

in Tampa and Key West and was pro-Castro.
He had traveled to Cuba in May of 1962
and had a brother in the Cuban military
who was studying in the Soviet Union.

On November 17, 1963, the Cuban American
was at a get-together at the home of a
member of the Tampa chapter of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. This was the
same Fair Play for Cuba Committee that
Oswald had possibly contacted in May of
1963.


Book V, p. 63-64

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 166

In March of 1964, the Warren
Commission requested from Director
Hoover information on certain pro-
Castro and anti-Castro organizations
which were active in the U.S.
including the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee, and Alpha 66, among
others. The Bureau furnished less
than a full and satisfactory
response and did not disclose the .
fact that the CIA had operational
interests in certain of the entities
inquired about.


Book V, p. 65 The FBI reports on Alpha 66 furnished
the Warren Commission noted the attack
on the Soviet vessel in March of 1963
but did not detail that group's
continued activity in planning and
carrying out their military operations
against Cuba. The FBI reports did not
show that Alpha 66 had been involved
with the New Orleans anti-Castro train-
ing camp.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 167


Book V, p. 65

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 168

It is known that the CIA took an
interest in the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee with which Oswald was
associated. According to Bureau
documents, the Agency advised the
Bureau that they were considering

the use of disinformation that might
embarass the Committee in areas where
the Committee had support.


Book V, p. 72

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 169

In late July 1964, an FBI informant
reported that the CIA was meeting with
AMLASH for the purpose of assassinating
Castro. Informant also reported that
AMLASH was unhappy with the CIA's efforts
and that Attorney General Kennedy had
refused to support the plan but that the
plan had not been completely put to rest.
This information was not disseminated
outside the Bureau at the request of the
informant. But the Bureau notations
indicate that the Bureau was looking
into an underworld plot against Castro
that might be coincidental with the
AMLASH plan. The Bureau had first been
informed of AMLASH-CIA meetings in
October 1963, That information did not
indicate assassination involvement.

The AMLASH operation was insecure
prior to the Fitzgerald meeting
with AMLASH, a meeting that
Fitzgerald was urged not to under-
take by several in the Agency.

Individuals outside tHe CIA had
been brought into the| operation,
and the Agency learned that one
of these individuals was in
clandestine contact with Cuban
intelligence (Cable from
European station to CIA Head-
quarters, 3/18/65).


Book V, p. 78

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 172

Victor Espinosa, a Cuban exile, involved
in the transporting explosives to New
Orleans in 1963, contacted INS with
information about the AMLASH operation.
This information was turned over to the
FBI which informed the CIA. Both
agencies interrogated Espinosa in June
of 1965 and found that he knew that
AMLASH and others were planning a coup
which. involved the assassination of
Castro and that the CIA had been
involved with AMLASH and others in the
planning.

Espinosa and AMLASH were life-long friends
but during the interrogation he gave no
indication that he was aware of the 1963
AMLASH-CIA meetings. Espinosa's
information noted in the 1967 IG Report
suggests a link between the AMLASH
operation and the CIA plots to assassinate
Castro using underworld contacts.
Therefore, Espinosa's information raised
the possibility that underworld figures
who were aware of the Harvey plots may
have been aware of the AMLASH operation.
CIA reaction to this interrogation was

to terminate the operation immediately.


Book V, p.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 173

CIA had FBI files on Espinosa detailing
his involvement with anti-Castro exiles
and underworld figures who were operating
the guerrilla training camps in New
Orleans in July 1963.

In mid-1965 the CIA interrogated Tepedino,
New York jeweler, who had been involved
with the AMLASH operation from the
beginning. The report concluded that
the subject was. deceptive during the
interrogation and withheld pertinent
information in one or more relevant
areas. Tepedino lied in response to
questions dealing with AMLASH's and his
ties to Cuban intelligence. Tepedino
stated that AMLASH had no plan to over-
throw Castro. Tepedino stated AMLASH
had strong connections with Cuban
intelligence and was probably cooperating
with it in various ways. Although
AMLASH never mentioned these connections
to his CIA case officers; Teledino
stated that AMLASH had mentioned them

“to him and almost everyone else he had

met.


Book V, p. 79

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 175

The FBI made the connection between
Espinosa's 1963 activities and the
fact that in 1965 he was knowledgeable
of CIA involvement in plans to
assassinate Castro. However, there
is no evidence that either the CIA or
FBI investigated this connection
until 1967.


Book V, p.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 176

Although the CIA had received information
that AMLASH was a provocation there is

no evidence that the CIA investigated

the possibility of a connection between
its fall 1963 meetings ‘with AMLASH and
the assassination of President Kennedy.


Book V, P. 80 A client of Morgan's had informed him

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 177

that the United States had attempted
to assassinate Castro in the early
1960's and that Castro had decided to
retaliate. This information was passed
to Drew Pearson who in turn attempted
to have Chief Justice Warren look into
it but he declined.


Book V, P. 81

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 178

Supervisory personnel assigned to the
assassination investigation have
uniformly testified they do not recall
ever discussing or reviewing memoranda
which touch upon Cuban involvement

in the assassination or of Cuban
retaliation for the. CIA assassination
plots.


Book V, p. 81

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 179

According to Secretary of State Rusk
in his testimony before the Warren
Commission, 6/10/64, he stated there
was ''very considerable concern" in Cuba
immediately following the assassination
as to whether Cuba would be held
responsible for the assassination and
what effect the assassination might
have on Cuba's position and security.


Book V, p. 84 On March 21, 1967, WFO send Headquarters

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 180

10 copies of a blind memorandum which
stated Castro employed assassination
teams for the purpose of removing
President Kennedy. Morgan's clients
were also aware of the identity of
individuals sent to the United States

for that purpose. He understood that two
such individuals were now in the state

of New Jersey. The transmittal slip is
attached to this memorandum.

Neither the President nor the Attorney
General ordered a follow-up investigation
after receiving this memo.

Selia Sanchez, Haiti Santa Maria, Paco

Okay now, what happened

Castanyava...

Castanyava

Castanyava was the chief of the Navy.

And, Fidel offered you a job or something, can you
go into that?

Well he was very fond of everything German. He

said he read and my father, you know, tried
to pacify the tourists, the passengers on the ship
because they were terrified. They thought they were
being invaded. So I helped my father pacify the
tourists and it was really a funny scene. Then I
steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to
dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the
table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise.

And he offered you a job, right?

Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back
up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged
gifts, and my father and Fidel seemed to get along
very well. My father is diplomatic and they
exchanged plaques and my father's silver ashtray and
stuff like that. And he asked me, he asked my father
if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back,
return to Cuba to be his secretary since he was
getting German mail and he did not speak German and
he assured me that I would be safe and set up in an
office, and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I had
friends in Cuba anyway.

How old were you then?

Nineteen, nineteen years old

Did you get off the ship and stay there?

No, I went back to New York. Fidel, on the bridge,
asked me for my phone number and address in New York

and said he would call me, and I just, I didn't
believe it.

The same day I arrived in New York. Because my
father took off that night for Germany again and
the phone ring, and it rang at 1 o'clock in the
morning. I guess the previous...

Well he went back to Germany with the ship, right?
Where did you) go?

I was, living with my brother in New York City.

My brother was a translator for the United Nations

and I was alone living in New York City going to

the Merchantson Banker School.

Well how did you get back to New York City from
Havana?

On my father's ship. It was the last stop on the
cruise of about 5 or 6 stops.

Oh, in other words the, in other words the ship left
that night, left Havana that night...

Yeah.

went over to New York and then from New York went
back to Europe, right?

Yes. Yes. I|thought about Fidel and he pointed out
this is my Havana and I guess I was impressed. I
was young, I don't know. And I thought that...

He called, -he jcalled you, he knew just about what
time you were |going to arrive in New York and when
you got there jhe called you, what, the same, the same
day you got there?

The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I
just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said
one moment please, the Prime Minister is on the phone,
on the line, and I heard some shouting and then I

heard "hello".
Did he speak Cuban or English to you?

He spoke broken English in his hoarse voice. I guess

he was giving a lot of speeches at that time. And he
asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I

think about you very much and I call. I keep my word.

I want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep."

Page 185


ML: So, I was as surprised, I was very surprised.

(contd. )

FS: How long was it did you leave New York to go to
Havana?

ML: Fidel said to me, I said is this really you Fidel,

and he said yes. I am in Havana Hilton, you call
me back in room 2408, and I said no, alright I
believe you I said because how else would you have
my number. He said "I want you come back. I think
about you and I will send a plane, my plane, and you
come back." And it was a joke really, I liked the
Cocoa Glace, it's an ice cream in a cocoanut shell,
and he had sent to my father's ship a case of it so
I would have enough for the return trip home because,
I don't know, I just talked about Havana, the island
in general. So I, and I still didn't believe him
that he would send the plane.

FS: Did he send the airplane?

ML: Yes.

FS: What kind of an airplane did he send?

ML: A.Cubana airliner with...

FS: Four engines?

ML: Yes, with two men and two men came to the, my door.

I was living at 344 West 87th Street at the time, on
the second floor, and my brother was at a UN party
and I was home alone studying. Oh no, in fact I was
reading a Herbert L. Mathews article on Fidel Castro
and Cuba when the doorbell rang, and it was Jesus

and Pedro
and they showed me identification. One came in military
uniform, the other in civilian clothes. One smiled,
one didn't. One said, "Are you ready?" And one said,
"We go now. Fidel want very much to see you.”

FS: (Laughter).
ML: And I said I didn't finish my homework yet. I was like
sy, in shock. I didn't know what to do. So they said they
“ were staying in a hotel, that they would, the plane

would leave tomorrow, please be ready. I, meanwhile I
haven't even unpacked, you know, from the cruise. My

ML: clothes were all laundered anyway from the ship and
(contd.) I hadn't even unpacked because I was worred about
missing two days at school.

FS: Yeah.
ML: So I went...
FS: Well these are incidentals anyway, so, what'd you

do, you went to the airport? What airport did the
airplane, was the airplane at?

ML: Uh, LaGuard,.which is not Kennedy, it was at that
time named something else. Idlewild, right?

FS: Idlewild, yeah.

ML: And...

FS: It was Idlewild airport, that's where they had the
airplane, Cubana Airlines?

ML: Yeah, Cubana Airlines. Got on the plane...

FS: How many people where on the airplane?

ML: Me, a steward, a pilot and a co-pilot and the two
guards.

FS: Ha, ha, had -- that's funny. Go ahead.

ML: So anyway, I met Fidel and that's when I got involved.

FS: This is more or less a background so they know her
background.

Cause we'll go over this lightly.

I was in the...

At the Hilton? f

I was driven by black limousine right to the Hilton.
And that's where Fidel was staying at the Hilton, right?

Yes, he was having an argument in his suite with Chez
Raoul and some Americans.

He was having some argument with some Americans. Do
you know who the Americans were?

Yes.

Who were they?

One lady attorney trying to promote something, Muriel...
Oh this was more business or something like that?

Yes business. Everybody was trying to promote this
and that with Fidel.

Yes, well that's immaterial.

So then I was told to go in the room and wait and the
door locked. And I was in there, in his suite, and
Fidel came in and I missed him and he missed me and
the rest is going to be in the book if I ever write it.
You'll write it don't worry. Alright now...

If I live.

Do you know approximately when you met me?

A couple months, or two months, or three months after
that.

No,That was very, I think you met me around what, April?

That's what I said, a couple months...

Right.

right after that.

In April, right. And this is where we made contact
and so forth and then we saw each other a few times
after that...

In the coffee shop.

In the coffee shop and this is when you were recruited
to go ahead and spy for the United States and so forth
and, were you ever introduced or, to Colonel Nickels?
Yes.

Do you know who Colonel Nickels is, right. He was

the Colonel who was military attache with the American
Embassy in Havana, Cuba at that time, right?

Yes.

Okay. Then you started your spy thing and so forth
and so forth, alright?

Um hum.

We'll go ahead and jump a little bit and so forth.
There were several meetings that Fidel had in the
Hilton with some of the people of the staff. I was
present at the meeting, right?

Right.

And, one of the time that Fidel was talking to the
staff concerned the gambling casinos and American
business interests in Cuba, right?

Right.

Cuba. All the American businessesiwere going to go.
ahead and be nationalized because it was Cuba and the
Cuba for the Cubans.

Right.

And so forth. And then it was suggested about well
you know the American government may not like it.
You're gonna have all the American business interests
put pressure on the State Department which would put
pressure on him and that they would be up in arms and
they would have the agents, they would send new agents
into Cuba because the CIA at that time was very close,
closely contacted, at least certain people in the CIA
had contact with the 26th of July movement. As a
matter of fact that they were exchanging information
with Castro...

Uh hum.

which enabled him to outwit many of the other groups
so really CIA helped Fidel quite a bit in this power
struggle that was going on in Cuba at that time. So
Fidel, with the help of CIA... :

Yes.

‘got to be the ruler of Cuba. Now...

I would, what about, where did Fidel get most of his
guns from?

Well, you know...
To lead the revolution?

Right, you know, so forth. That's a story which we
won't have to go into and so forth because we just
(unintelligible) briefly over it. And then there
came a period of time where Fidel in all his
popularity and so forth was, now Fidel with you - he
made approaches to you, right, and so forth?

Mm-Hmm.

You know, and you liked him and you actually in
liking him like a young girl thought for the future
that here's a man that I, you admired, that you
started to get an affection for him and so forth,
and really you thought of marriage, right?

Mm-hmm,

And in the process of being close with him, being as
the man's intelligent, dynamic and so forth, he did
force his attentions on you and naturally he seduced
you. You didn't want to but it happened.

Yes.

And you had nobody to go to because, hey, you're in
his Cuba, right?

I was in his Cuba alright.

Right, now also what we were getting in this Senate
Intelligence Committee has got is the things that
Fidel has stated against the United States government
if they tried to interfere with the revolution and so
forth when the new election time comes because at that
time the President of the United States was Eisenhower
and it looked like that the Democrats were going to
win the election and he felt that if a new government,

-which was discussed among the top military people, if

the new government came in and if they decided that they
didn't like Fidel's policy, which Fidel was saying what
he was going to do for Cuba on an international scale,
that if the United States government decided to go and
turn against him and put pressure on him he would do

‘ likewise to the United States government. And he was

going to export his revolution in Latin America. These

They told me not to say anything.

Well, honey, they got it on record and you're gonna
go ahead and send this down there because Senator
Baker knows who your case agent is, knows the CIA
agent that you were in touch with.

You know I keep remembering don't embarass the Bureau

Honey, you're not embarassing the Bureau. What you're

you gonna do it?

Mmn.

You know we get back to the same thing again. Yeah,
you're looking for protection. So far the people
you've worked with, so far this man Pucci who you
saved his life, and saved another. undercover agent's
life whose working with the FBI. These people are
powerful people yet they have done nothing with the
problem that you have had right now with you, three
times there's been an attempt on your life, isn't
that correct? One time they almost threw you out of
an 18 story building. Another time you got pistol-
whipped. You did all this crap for these people
here yet they will do nothing to go ahead at the
present time, and this is on record in their own
files and so forth, yet you cannot move them to give
you or your children any protection. This piece of
tape is going to go right to Senator Baker's office,
it'll go to Howard Liebengood for him to listen to,
to evaluate it and turn this tape over to the proper
authorities which will be the Justice Department.
You can call Howard Liebengood to see if he has
received those codes from the Albanian Embassy from
me. You can call him and find out, and also you

can call him at the same time and let him know if

a tape has been turned over to him. As a matter of
fact when I get there Friday and leave this in his
office I will instruct his people in the office to
get a hold of you, because I'm gonna leave your phone
number with Senator's Baker's people, with Senator
Baker is on, has a Committee on Intelligence...

Mm-hmm.

He's got the committee. It's a new Committee that has
been formed on intelligence. See, now I am turning this
information over to the proper authorities. See. And
this information is not going to go to any newspaper
or anybody...

we want to see your files on this girl. And baby
they got to go and come up with it. And if they don't
come up with it they're in trouble. They're in

We had, the building consisted of 300 units, which

300 apartments, my husband had access to files. Each
Soviet file read the same -- Permanent Mission of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republic resident, and I

got interested. Then one day an agent came at 9 o'clock
in the morning, and my husband had been previously
working with Treasury and other agencies, including

this agent which I'll name, that's Al Chestone.

His first name was what?

Albert, Albert Chestone,

What agency was he with?

The FBI.

Special Agent, FBI?

Yes, counterintelligence.

previously working with the Polaris missile, Polaris
missile thing. This was before I met my husband or
married him. He did something with the Polaris
missile thing. And my husband was paid by this same
agent. Anyway, we, he came daily and we went over the
tenants' list and we sort of dissected everybody in
the building.

Alright now, were you recruited by this agent?

Yes, he said are you willing to work and I said, well,
why not? He said it doesn't consist of much, a few
burglaries (laughter)...

you and your husband doing the burglaries or you by

And...

Well when you did these burglaries...

We all did them together. They're were about Ce

7 cars. One stationed in front of the Soviet Mission.
Suppose, say like they were interested in one Soviet
who they lost track of, who was supposed to be in
Washington, D. C., and then they found him all of a
sudden in our building because they had surveillance
across the street. That's the first thing - they set
up surveillance, a camera, high-power camera across
the street. That we were pointed out to. That
everybody who went in and out of the building was
photographed.

Including yourself and your husband?

They discussed it in front of me.

I mean did your husband say he had, he would discuss
it with you about...

Now, when the agents, before your husband opened the
door with the pass key, did the agents look the door
over to see if there was any powder marks, tapes,
hairs, or anything, or something leaning against the
door to signify that possibly when the Cuban general,

Alright, it makes no difference. Alright, don't

worry about that. But they made entry into his
apartment.

Yes.

What did they do in his apartment?

I guess they microfilmed and planted a device. Anyway,
either way, whatever they did they did...

With the corpor, cooperation of your husband?
Cooperation of my husband...

And they did it sloppy because this particular Soviet,
the tennis player, made a formal complaint to the
23rd Precinct, PIU investigation unit, where I was
working.

When you say PIU, what's PIU?

Prisoner Investigation Unit.

Prisoner or Police?

Alright.

Now I answered the phones.

Oh, hm-mmm.

You understand?

Yeah.

And this tennis player called up and demanded a
detective. I was working up there and the detectives
were hot on a homicide and I answered the phone and
here it was the tennis player calling to make a formal
complaint of breaking and entering his apartment. I
had him on the phone.

And he didn't know it was you.

And I died, I tried to disguise my voice and he kept
on talking and talking and talking and I couldn't

disguise my voice. I was afraid he would know that I,
it was me. I took the complaint in other words.

Right.

And I wrote up the 61.

Go ahead. Now let me ask you this here.

The 61 - complaint report.

Alright, let me ask you this here. You say you were
working for this police department in this precinct.

What was your job with them?

Auxiliary volunteer. Photos, translations, rape
cases, interrogation.

And at that time you were answering phone calls that
were coming in?

And typing, and: doing other things but I don't really
want to get those guys involved because they...

No, I just wanted, wanted them to know what you were
doing in the police department.

I was an auxiliary sergeant.
Answering the phones. Okay.
Auxiliary is a volunteer police.

Right, good enough. Now what other entries did you make
with them. That's two -- that you specified.

Two. The rest I didn't want to go along with because
I was a little afraid so my...

Things were getting a little hot for you.

Yes, because we had too many Russians, we had the
Albanians, we had the Red Chinese.

All living in that building?

All living in the same building. There was, it was
comical. The Albanians wouldn't talk to the Russians,
the Russians ignored the Albanians, the Red Chinese
went down the service entrance and to avoid the
Russians and the Al-, it was just,the Secret Service
in the garage and in the front door. The narcotics

peddlers coming out of the laundry room. It was, it
was a merry-go-round.

In other words,

We had, in one day about four different agencies
watching people.

In and out of the building.

And we didn't know if we were coming or going.

Yeah.

We lived on the second floor. We had a view of the
street and we would signal to the, across the street
surveillance apartment, apartment, you know. We'd
see the cars pull up and the cars leave.

Alright, now...

My husband did most of, he'd been doing it.

He'd been doing most of the end of the...

Yes, because I felt I didn't want to get caught. I
just didn't want to get caught because it was a heck
of a chance because more than one Soviet family lived
on one floor and if anyone of them walked out when my
husband was opening the door to let those guys in my
husband would have been dead.

Alright, not only that I understand that you were
getting very familiar with many of the families of...

But your husband continued to work with the agency,
right?

Yes. We, we took, we ID'd photos.. We watched for
cars. We watched their movement. It was day and night.

That's doing surveillance on these people.

Yeah. We were...

How about the Albanians now, tell me about the code.
The Albanians, the Albanians we got very friendly with
a Mr. Koyani, Ambassador to the Mission, the U.N., and
the Albanians are not as elite as the Russians are.
The Russians dry clean their own clothes, burn their
own garbage, have no photos, personal things in the
apartment. The Albanians are more, they allow their
children to watch television. The Soviets don't. We
convinced the Albanians who had a mission on their
mission, which they blocked a complete fire exit was

on the 21st floor of the Newberry. They lived in the
apartments on the 20th floor and the 22nd floor. And

DocId:32423630 Page 217


FS:

HW 50955 DocId:32423630

-36-

they had about 30, 30 families who resided there and
their mission was there. And we became very friendly
with them because of one incident, especially my
husband, took, went to see his mother and left me in
charge of the building. That same day they had a so-
called demonstration where the demonstrators had a
25-minute picketing right to picket. The demonstra-
tion turned into a bloody riot where they burned flags
and everything and the Albanians came down. They all
are armed. They're all armed, and they agitated the
rioters out on the street. And I was alone with only
my basic police training and my wits, really, and a
panicking doorman and my kids. I was just alone. I,
the first thing I looked out the window when I heard
the shooting I called the Bureau‘and I said, "Get me
Al Chestone fast." I said I don't have Louis here.
I said I need help. I have a demonstration. I don't
know what to do. And there were about 500 people
throwing bricks, bottles, everything through the plate
glass windows. Burning American flags and Albanian
flags because of something that happened in Albania.
Those that defected here started this demonstration.
So then I, things got out of hand, the doorman was
hurt with a brick. I saw blood, and the Albanian
Ambassador and five top officials agitated these
people from inside the lobby with fists. Very
unprofessional-like.

Yeah.

So I physically pulled them by their coats and told
them, "Get upstairs, get upstairs and get yourself
back into the mission", because tenants were walking
through the lobby and we were going to get hurt by
flying glass and everything else. And I had no help.
The police were outside of the line...

Marita, what we're going into details is something
that is a story.

Oh, alright.

So we'll go ahead and just bypass that.

Anyway, the Albanians Al was interested into, and
especially because they were admitting the Red Chinese
into the United Nations, which they did. It was that

speech, which I have the original copy of. Ambassador
Rocco Nocco - sounds crazy, but that's his name, Rocco

Nocco, and they were, they were sloppier, and the
agent Al Chestone told me convince them, you know,
case ‘em, keep going. up and down the steps, what
time they throw their garbage out. Garbage was
the most valuable source of information for the
Bureau, and that was...

Garbage and trash.

Trash. Chicken bones, codes, diapers, whatever, you
know, and that was my job because I had the patience.
Now the FBI supplied me with bandaids and gloves,
flashlights, batteries and the whole thing, because

I convinced the Albanians that the compacter, which
was the disposal system in the building from 31 floors
down ~- in other words when they threw their garbage
out that it would come out in brick form, block form,
brick crushed, which in fact was not true.

But they believed it?

They believed it. They trusted us. Louis and I were
the only ones allowed in the mission. We were. the
only ones.

Now this mission is that building you were talking
about.

That's still. there.

Still there.

Very much there. That's the code that you have.
Right.

So, I started, made it a every two hour routine to go
after midnight when they put their garbage out in the
hall, pick up the bags. Take them down to the service
entrance and take the bags at home, take ‘em home.

And go through the orange peels and chicken bones and
gather torn up letters, this was before they got smart
and bought a shredder (unintelligible). And I would
turn this garbage letter, in other words, I would
past it together and give it to the Bureau and some
of these letters turned out to be very valuable. Among
them was one code, now...

Page 219


NW 50955

FS:

FS:

FS:

-38-

I would assume that these letters that were in code
they would be classified material. Otherwise it
wouldn't be in code.

Very valuable, yes. The...
And this was turned over to who?

To Al Chestone. The first code I got, I just got on
a hunch lucky. Because it was just at the time when
the Red Chinese entered the United States, first
came here. Mr. Huang Yua, and I met them. We met
them first before anybody met them, Louis and I.

And that same night the code came down at 3:00 in the
morning and I just had a hunch and I got up and I
said, "Louis I can't sleep, I'm going down and do

_some work. Give me the keys to the compacter room."

So I went downstairs and I waited and sure enough
around 3:30 these bags started to come down from the
21st floor.

3:30 in the morning?

3:30 in the morning because Al said watch them
closely, because of the Red Chinese. And I shut
the machine off and I got these, I got this code,
I caught it in other words, but it...

This is the code you turned over to me?

This is the first code, the very first code, at the
risk of having my hands chopped off because if I
didn't shut that machine off in time I could have
been hurt. But I got it. The first code was very
valuable. It was sent to Washington.

(End of tape - side 2).

...these bags of stuff and if you hadn't have turned
off the machine you would have got your hand either
chopped up or cut off, and so forth. What did, were
you saying about Al, Uncle Al?

Uncle Al slept and I did the work, and by the time I
got upstairs and took the orange peels and everything
out of the garbage and separated the letters and

every tiny little piece with tweezers and everything,

DocId: 32423630 Page 220


HW 50955

FS:

FS:

put it all in a box, right down to every piece. I
ruined my rugs and everything. And Uncle Al would
come at 8:30, 9:00 in the morning and I would still
be up separating the garbage and he'd be all fresh
and ready for work and I had just come back from the
garbage room. And...

You stayed awake all night?

Yeah, with the tweezers and I use to run out of
skotch tape which was frustrating cause I couldn't
stick these letters togethers without skotch tape,

so he brought me a big box of skotch tape which

was very kind of him. Then I would give it to him
and he'd, he'd have coffee, tea and toast or whatever.
And I'd say, "Now I want to go to sleep." And he'd
say, "No, no, no, wait a minute. Mr. So-and-so,

or Berzofsky, we want to get a line on Mr. Berzofsky.

Who was Mr. Berzofsky?

Berzofsky, the Second Secretary to the Union of the
Soviet Socialist Republic.

What was his first name, do you know?
Mmmm, I forgot...
That's alright, it don't matter.

I forgot really. But we were very close to him. His
wife was a surgeon in the Soviet mission and she was,
she's, she's adorable. She's nice, she's sweet and
she has a lovely daughter, Irene, who turned out to
have liver cancer. She was a little girl when I first
met her, like my daughter. My daugher played with her,
they took piano lessons together, exchanged books, and
the little girl, at sixteen, Irene was sent back to
the Soviet Union with liver cancer. I got very close
to the mother, the mother was heartbroken, the father
was heartbroken. I guess like any mother and father
when their only child turns out to have liver cancer.
She's diagnosed as such in the Soviet Union and they
asked me to get medicine, pain killers for Irene. I
do so and pass along to them empirin and codine #4,
which is a pain killer which they smuggled over to

their daughter on with the permission of
the FBI. We exchanged jewelry, clothes, and everything
else. We were just one mother to another mother.

Their little girl in trouble, mine not in trouble and
it was little things like that that I would get very
involved with. I don't know...

Morita let me ask you this here, did the agents ever
tell you to go out with any of the diplomats in the
mission?

Well, now we have to go back to Oleg, Oleg Likichev.
And who is he again?

He was the KGB spy that they lost and thought he, they
thought he was still residing in Washington, the out-
side of Washington, D. C., in Virginia. He was
supposed to have last been seen in Virginia somewhere
and all of a sudden they picked him up in our building,
as being in our building. They lost him and they were
furious, the Bureau, and they wanted us very close to
him. And he, we had a lot of evenings together we
spent with him, dinners, and he came to us,

In other words he asked you to go out, did he ask
(unintelligible)

Well, Oleg, Oleg, let's just say, I don't know if it
was a game they were playing or if they were doubles
or what. They talked a lot about the State of
Washington, residing in the State of Washington.
They also knew I had diamonds and he asked me,
(unintelligible) "Can you get me diamonds?"

What did he call you?
Ilonka Marischa, Ilona Marita.
Oh, that's in Russian?

Yes. And we always exchanged Russian words and I
know a few, enough to get by on. All of a sudden,
you know, he was interested in diamonds. He had a
fascination for diamonds. His wife, she was kind
of sweet on my husband he was kind of sweet on me
and I kept telling Uncle Al this thing is going to
get out of hand. I said all of a sudden he wants

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 222


=41-

diamonds, and Al, what do I do. Go ahead, talk to
him about diamonds. So I said Oleg, what do you
mean by diamonds? He said uncut stones for cash.

I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry
store like you and buy them. I want diamonds. I'm
willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for them.

I said, I said tell me why, Oleg. And he said,
“Money, why does anybody want diamonds." I said it's
a good enough reason. So I said, "Hey, Louis, what
can we do for Oleg about his diamonds?" And Louis
said we'll figure something out. And then Oleg said,
this was at a dinner party up in their house. Hot
diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So

he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he
would buy them for cash.

FS: How serious was he? Did you ever get any for him?

ML: Well it got this far. We told Uncle Al the next
morning. I said, "Uncle Al, I got a surprise for
you. You're gonna have to come up with some hot
diamonds. A hundred thousand dollars worth because
I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since
he can't buy them. Oleg wants diamonds." And I
said if you can put two and two together maybe this
guy will defect because he's talking about the State
of Washington. I said but you have to be careful,
I have to be careful, no? So Al said I'll get you
the diamonds. You tell him to get the cash ready.
So Uncle Al went to an underworld source and got
the diamonds. Uncle Al made a boo-boo and Oleg, the
day of the exchange I was supposed to make the sale
in tthe apartment, Oleg was at a sports meeting in
Washington,D.C. Uncle Al.said, "I've got to give
these diamonds back to the underworld or give them
the cash."' I said, "Listen, I told you tomorrow,
not today, Al. Tomorrow, because Oleg told us he's
going to this soccer meeting in Washington, D.C.
Alright whatever the kind of meeting it is. He is
in Washington, D. C." "Oh is he?" I said, "Yes,
he is." Right. Anyway, Uncle Al started to panick
because he was in my house with a hundred thousand
dollars worth of uncut, hot diamonds.

FS: By himself?

ML: By himself, and I was supposed to get the cash from
Oleg. Oleg said on a Thursday and Uncle Al came on

a Wednesday and the whole thing...
So what happened?

fell through. Al said he had to give them back to
the underworlds, to his source. So he took them
back and then Oleg, you know, I had to talk ny

way out of it. It was just-one of the flubs. But
anyway after I left my husband Oleg kept asking for
me, kept coming directly to the apartment and say-
ing, "Louis, I don't believe you two split, you two
go, she left. I don't believe it." And my husband
said "yes, she did leave. It's her own problems,
Oleg, you know, forget about it." And he said,
"No, it's not possible. You must stay together.
You must stay together." Anyway, he kept coming,
about four times and asking my husband, until my
husband made a joke of it and said Oleg wants to
see you. I mean he's made it damn plain that he
wants to see you. In other words if you're
finished I'll take over, Where is she living? My
husband tells him I'm living on 88th Street. Now

I talked to my husband and I said what did you do
that for? Tell him I'm living on 88th Street?

You know, because I know he wants to go out with
me. You can feel: it, I can feel it, the, you know?
So I call up,Uncle Al meantime is transferred to
Newark, I get another case agent. Louis gets a
case agent for the building and he works alone,
without me. The other agent is John Kotter.

With the FBI?

FBI, 69th Street. I call up John Kotter. I said,
"John, I hear your taking Al's place", and I meet
him. Drop things, start things, drop things,
different assignments, then we get to Oleg. I said
look, Oleg is bothering Louis. He wants to go out
with me. And John Kotter says, "Beautiful, that is
a beautiful setup. Let's call him up." I said,
“Hey, wait a minute. Either do this sophisticated,
alright? First I'll send him a Christmas card and
sign it Ilonka Marischa, you know? I'll put my
phone number on the bottom, something you know?

Or I'll happen to be there when he's going into the
building, or I'll bump into him."' I said you don't
just call him up. You know that's going to be like
a setup because I've been avoiding him. So; anyway,
he tells, he outlines the whole thing. I said what
have you.got planned, John. And he says, "Do you

realize what a bomb this is? This top KGB spy wants
you?" And I said, "Well", I say “he's not really my
type.", I said but again, the best interests of the
country, but how far do you want me to go? And he
said “all the way". I said what is all the way? He
said, "You start with a Christmas card." Well the
Christmas card was answered by Oleg going to Louis
and saying, "I got Llonka's Christmas card. Where is
she living, Louis?" You know, so John talked me into
calling the mission. I call up the mission, across
from 19th precinct, and I said, "Oleg, this is Ilonka
Marischa. Hello darling", you know, and this, this
and this. And I said oh boy everything is wired and
everything from the mission anyway. But he's top dog
there. He is top dog in the mission. He has the
say. He's a very important person in the Soviet
mission. Anyway, John okays a telephone coil pickup
that I have on my phone to a Soni tape recorder. We
make a tape of this because John Kotter is sitting on
pins and needles waiting for me to replay that tape
on what Oleg tells me, you know? Oleg doubletalks
but we get a message that we want to meet, you know?
So they had some kind of a security council and we
made a date and it was postponed. Oleg called up

and apologized which I also have on tape. And each
time the Bureau was very happy. We're gonna start a
blossoming relationship here, you know, and end up
with photographs and better something, which I don't
think I would have gone all the way. But that's what
their idea was so they can exchange at a later date.

Blackmail?

Well...
into :
Blackmail him / giving them information (unintelligible).
Say like they get one of our, one of our pilots, right?
And if we don't get our pilot back they expose Oleg,
right? Or make him...
Be a double agent. Blackmail him...
Be a double...
into being a double agent.
Right.

That's the idea.

And I'm in the middle. So, anyway, I go, I go to the
mission with my daughter, who was at the time 12 years
old. My daughter, I guess, is a little use to my
life. She's use to FBI all her life. She knows not
to talk. She knows whether we look at her when to
say something. I guess she's the closest thing to me
now. She goes along. She's very cool and we both
walked into the mission on the pretense that she had
to do a project for school on the Soviet Union. She
needed material. Now as soon as we walked into the
mission everybody there I know because they reside in
the building. And they all say, "Ilonka Marischa
blah, blah, blah, blah." And I'm very friendly with
them all. They all love my daughter. But we're
there for other reasons. We're there to go to see
Oleg. We gather, we gather the material, meanwhile
I'm aware that every picture has an eye or every
poster has a mirror or camera, you know? But my
daugher's very cool and we're left alone in the room
where the Soviet material is displayed. But I know
we're being watched. She knows it too and she
doesn't, she says, "Mommy, look, this is beautiful,
beautiful." You know? Then I ask for Oleg to this
very, very tough Soviet woman that said "What you
want?'", you know. I said "Oleg Likichev, please.

I'd like to speak to him." And she called and he

is still in the United Nations, he asks you to wait.
I refused a wire or anything like that, but...

What wire are you talking about?

A wire on me.

Oh.

Because...

That the agents (unintelligible)

Yes, because Oleg I know likes me and if he sees me
he would grab me and hug me and that's the Russian
way...

Yeah.

And he'll feel that and I'm dead.

Right.

Right in the mission. That's not my proper there.

Right.

And I wouldn't risk it with my daughter. So, anyway,
we waited. We were allowed the run-of the place. We
knew everyone there and...

Like you say, eyes were watching you.

Oh definitely, definitely, because that's how they
test you when you walk in there. And you just don't
get in there and have the run of the place, you're
not left alone. But I know you're being watched.

Sure.

Anyway, there was this, it was, it was a legitimate
excuse that Oleg was tied up in the United Nations
because it was in the paper the next day, that it
was some security council meeting. And I said
"Please give this note to Mr. Likichev. Tell him
thank you very much for the material. And best
wishes to his wife, blah, blah, blah," and we left.
Funny thing is the cop outside almost arrested us,
a uniformed police officer.

For what reason?

He gave us a dirty look and made a very slurring,
nasty remark when I left. But I hate to knock the
police department because they're helping me now.
But, I guess, he didn't know, you know?

Yeah, he thought you were Russians.

He thought I was a Russian.

Or a Russian sympathizer.

Right, especially going in with a child and I looked
very...

Yeah.

American. Anyway, I got home and John Kotter was
waiting in front of my door. I remember it was
raining. He was reading. And I said, he said "Are

you going to meet Oleg?" I said, "Now how the hell
can I make a date with Oleg with my daughter?"

Yeah.

Page 227

ML: I said Oleg's in the United Nations. Why don't you
tell me these things before that they're delayed at
a security council meeting, you know, instead of me
letting, letting me sit there. You know these are
all the little things that use to annoy me...

FS: Yeah.

ML: that they have to screen things first before, you
know - check things out, don't have to make a blunder
like that. Anyway, I said I left Oleg a note. I
said now you go home and I'm going to take it easy
and they, we tried, and I said, "You know, John,
you're just going to get me so involved with Oleg.
I'm not going to end up in bed in a motel room
upstate somewhere with Oleg so you can come in and
take photographs. That's not my stick." I said
I'll gather garbage, get license plates, tape, do
everything else, but, I'll even take the mail, like
I've been doing, but I'm not going to be caught in

not getting anything for it right now. They allowed
me to take mail, steam it, photograph it and put it
back. Some of that mail is now missing, which
belongs to the Soviet people, which this perpetrator,
perpetrator has and wants to blackmail me with and I
asked the FBI to please help me with that.

“FS: Who's the perpetrator?

ML: The perpetrator is Guiseppi Faisiano, aka Pionne,
aka David Ring, who broke into my apartment and stole
this tape with Oleg Likichev, these love conversations,
the mail, and part of the Albanian code. He has those
in his possession. He threatens my life with it. He
threatens blackmail with me. He assaulted me. He
pistol-whipped me and I asked the Bureau for help.

FS: Did he try to throw you out the 18 story. build-, window?
ML: Yes.
FS: He did what?
é ML: Yes, he tried to push me out the window.
\ FS: 18 stories?
ML: Yes, and I told him stay away, get back, because if

anything happens to me there's letters with the
Justice Department naming everything I know about you,

and he stopped cold. He threatened to shoot my
daughter in the back. He's threatening her right
now with disgrace because she is the daughter of

the, of a well-known man. Right now my main concern
is the, these letters and the. code and the tape and
possibly other things, are in the hands of this
Guiseppi Faisiano, and he wants money from me and
he's probably right now at the building. He is
casing the Soviets and he's going to try to go to
the same people that he has on the letters to tell
them that I was an informant for the FBI for revenge,
for having him arrested on the assault charge with a
gun. He also wants money. He wants to disgrace the
FBL. He's blackmailing right now my husband, my ex-
husband, for the master keys of the Newberry. My
husband is calling me for help and I don't know what
to do. I asked Frank to help me. I gave him the
code because everybody refused. I was afraid to have
any-, anywhere. I guess Frank helped me before in
Cuba and I don't, I worked, he worked for me and I
worked for him and I don't know where to go because,
the only ones that are helping me now are the local
police - in their lunch hours or when I'm too afraid
to leave the house they buy me milk and fruit for the
kids. And they'll take the children home when I get
a threat on the phone or a box in the mailbox or get
my back door shot at. I take my children and I put
them in the 23rd precinct.

They even, off duty...

The off-duty police, police officers take my children
home...

And they spend time at the house?

And they spend time at the house in their free time
when they should be home with their families:

You want me turn the...

Yes, I would like you, Frank, to turn this over just
in case something happens to me because I don't know
which way it's going to come.

And you need some protection, right now, right?

I need some type of help for my children, because of
this man Pinno threatening to expose my dealings with
the FBI and to the foreign press. I just caught up
in this thing since 1959 and I've been with it up
until last month, last week and I've just, and I need
help. There is no help. I mean since last month and
I don't want my children hurt. They've already been
hurt.

Alright, I promise to turn this tape and the code over
to Senator Baker's committee, right?

Yes.

Who in turn will turn the information over to the
proper officials in Washington, D. C.

Yes. I don't mean to embarass the Bureau. I know how
important it is but at this point I need help
desparately for my kids. They're 6 and 14 and they
don't deserve what they have to go through. The

Marita Lorenze

You an. American citizen?
Yes.

Were you born here?

Born in Braemen, Germany on August 18, 1939 and my
mother registered me at birthwith the Consulate

_ because she was. stuck in the war over there, but I

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

DocId: 32423630

am an American citizen, not naturalized or anything.
I was registered as an American citizen.

How old were you when you came to the United States?

I.was about 12, came over on the U.S.S. Henry Gibbons,
American troop transport, because my mother worked for
the United States Army.

Okay, now we're going to go ahead and jump. You went
to Cuba what month and what year and on what ship?

I met, I went, I took several trips with my father
who was Commander of the oceanliner Berlin. I met
Fidel...

What was your father's full name?

Commander Heinrich Frederick Lorenz.

And how old was he?

Approximately 50-something, 55, when I first, I went
on several trips to Cuba before I met Fidel with,
but I was a little girl.

When's the first time you went to Cuba after Fidel
took over the government on January 1, 1959?

I met Fidel February 28, 1959, on one of my father's
cruises where Fidel came aboard with several of his
men. He said he saw the oceanliner from the Havana
Hilton balcony and he took a launch with his Chief
of the Navy, what's his name, I forgot, Castagna...

Forget it, forget about it, we can go ahead. Who
else was there besides the chief of the Cuban navy.

or

Selia Sanchez, Haiti Santa Maria, Paco
and Fidel and several of his armed guards.
Okay now, what happened

Castanyava...

Castanyava

Castanyava was the chief of the Navy.

And Fidel offered you a job or something, can you
go into that?

Well he was very fond of everything German. He

said he read and my father, you know, tried
to pacify the tourists, the passengers on the ship
because they were terrified. They thought they were
being invaded. So I helped my father pacify the
tourists and it was really a funny scene. Then I
steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to
dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the
table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise.

And he offered you a job, right?

Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back
up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged
gifts, and my father and Fidel seemed to get along
very well. My father is diplomatic and they
exchanged plaques and my father's silver ashtray and
stuff like that. And he asked me, he asked my father
if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back,
return to Cuba to be his secretary since he was
getting German mail and he did not speak German and
he assured me that I would be safe and set up. in an
office, and blah, blah, blah, blah. . And I had
friends in Cuba anyway.

How old. were you then?

Nineteen, nineteen years old.

Did you get off the ship and stay there?

No, I went back to New York. Fidel, on the bridge,
asked me for my phone number and address in New York

and said he would call me, and I just, I didn't
believe it.

Page 235


FS: When did he call you?

ML: The same day I arrived in New York. Because my
father took off that night for Germany again and
the phone ring, and it rang at 1 o'clock in the
morning. I guess the previous.

FS: Well-he went back to Germany with the ship, right?
Where did you go?

ML: I was living with my brother in New York City.
My brother was a translator. for the United Nations
and I was alone living in New York City going to
the Merchantson Banker School.

FS: Well how did you get back to New York City from
Havana?

ML: On my father's ship. It was the last stop on the
cruise of about 5 or 6 stops.

FS: Oh, in other words the, in other words the ship left
that night, left Havana that night...

ML: Yeah.

FS: went over to New York and then from New York went

back to Europe, right?

ML: Yes. Yes. I thought about Fidel and he pointed out
this is my Havana and I guess I was impressed. I
was young, I don't know. And I thought that...

FS: He called, .he called you, he knew just about what
time you were going to arrive in New York and when
you got there he called you, what, the same, the same
day you got there?

ML: The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I
just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said
one moment please, the Prime Minister is on the phone,
on the line, and I heard some shouting and then I
heard "hello".

FS: Did he speak Cuban or English to you?

ML: He spoke. broken English in his hoarse voice. I guess
he was giving a lot of speeches at that time. And he
asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I
think about you very much and I call. I keep my word.
I want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep.'

FS:

So, I was as surprised, I was very surprised.

How long was it did you leave New York to go to
Havana?

Fidel said to me, I said is this really you Fidel,
and he said yes. I am in Havana Hilton, you call
me back in room 2408, and I said no, alright I
believe you I said because how else would you have
my number. He said "I want you come back. I think
about you and I will send a plane, my plane, and you
come back." And it was a joke really, I liked the
Cocoa Glace, it's an ice cream in a cocoanut shell,
and he had sent to my father's ship a case of it so
I would have enough for the return trip home because,
I don't know, I just talked about Havana, the island
in general. So I, and I still didn't believe him
that he would send the plane. :

Did he send the airplane?

Yes.

What kind of an airplane did he send?
A.Cubana airliner with...

Four engines?

Yes, with two men and two men came to the, my door.
I was living at 344 West 87th Street at the time, on
the second floor, and my brother was at a UN party
and I was home alone studying. Oh no, in fact I was
reading a Herbert L. Mathews article on Fidel Castro
and Cuba when the doorbell rang, and it was Jesus

and Pedro |
and they showed me identification: One came in military
uniform, the other in civilian clothes. One smiled,
one.didn't. One said, "Are you ready?" And one said,
"We go now. Fidel want very much to see you.”

(Laughter) .

And I said I didn't finish my homework yet. I was like
in shock. I-didn't know what to do. So they said they
were staying in a hotel, that they would, the plane
would leave tomorrow, please be ready. I, meanwhile I
haven't even unpacked, you know, from the cruise. My

NW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 237


ML: clothes were all laundered anyway from the ship and
(contd.)* I hadn't even unpacked because I was worred about
missing two days at school.

FS: Yeah.
ML: So I went...
FS: Well these are incidentals anyway, so, what'd you

do, you went to the airport? What airport did the
airplane, was the airplane at?

ML: Uh, LaGuard, which is not Kennedy, it was at that
time named. something else. Idlewild, right?

FS: Idlewild, yeah.

ML: And...

FS: It was Idlewild airport, that's where they had the
airplane, Cubana Airlines?

ML: Yeah, Cubana Airlines. Got on the plane...

FS: How many people where on the airplane? .

ML: Me, a steward, a.pilot and a co-pilot and the two
guards.

FS: Ha, ha, had -- that's funny. Go ahead.

ML: So anyway, I met Fidel and that's when I got involved.

FS: This is more or less a background so. they know her
background.

ML: Yeah that's, that's out anyway.

(Unidentified voice: "Yeah, right.")

FS: I mean don't drag it out so much because the details
of all this thing is...

ML: Yeah.

FS: Is yours, you know. Go over it lightly. So you went

back to Havana, right? :

Now when you went back to Havana you saw Fidel where?
Cause we'll go over this lightly.

I was in the...

At the Hilton?

I was driven by black limousine right to the Hilton.
And that's where Fidel was staying at the Hilton, right?

Yes, he was having an argument in his suite with Chez
Raoul and some Americans.

He was having some argument with some Americans. Do
you know who the Americans were?

Yes.

Who were they?

One lady. attorney trying to promote something, Muriel...
Oh this was more business or something like that?

Yes business. Everybody was trying to promote this
and that with Fidel.

Yes, well that's immaterial.

So then I was told to go in the room and wait and the
door locked. And I was in there, in his suite, and
Fidel came in and I missed him and he missed me and
the rest is going to be in the book if I ever write it.
You'll write it don't worry. ‘Alright now...

If I live.

Do you know approximately when you met me?

A couple months, or two months, or three months after
that.”

No,That was very, I think you met me around what, April?

April, right.
April of 1959, right?

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

Yeah.

And I believe we met at the Riviera Hotel in the
lobby?

Yes.

That's where, when I saw...

That's what I'said, a couple months...

Right.

right after that.

In April, right. And this is where we made contact
and. so forth and then we saw each other a few times |
after that...

In the coffee shop.

In the coffee shop and this is when you were recruited
to go ahead and spy for the United States and so forth
and, were you ever introduced or, to Colonel Nickels?
Yes.

Do you know who Colonel Nickels is, right. He was

the Colonel who was military attache with the American
Embassy. in Havana, Cuba at that time, right?

Yes.

Okay. Then you started your spy thing and so forth
and so forth, alright? .- :

Um Hum.

We'll go ahead and jump a little bit and so forth.
There were several meetings that Fidel had in the
Hilton with some of the people of the staff. I was
present at the meeting, right?

Right.

And, one of the time that Fidel was talking to the
staff concerned the gambling casinos and American
business interests in Cuba, right?

Right.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 240


FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

And it was stated that he was going to run all the
racketeers out of...

Out of Cuba.

Cuba. All the American businesses were going to go
ahead and be nationalized because it was Cuba and the
Cuba for the Cubans.

Right.

And so forth. And then it was suggested about well
you know the American government may not like it.
You're gonna have all the American business interests
put pressure on the State Department which would put
pressure on him and that they would be up in arms and
they would have the agents, they would send new agents
into Cuba because the CIA at that time was very close,
closely contacted, at least certain people in the CIA
had contact with the 26th of July movement. As a
matter of fact that they were exchanging information
with Castro...

Uh hum.

which enabled him to outwit many of the other groups
so really CIA helped Fidel quite a bit in this power
struggle that was going on in Cuba at that time. So
Fidel, with the help of CIA...

Yes. :
got to be the ruler of Cuba. Now...

I would, what about, where did Fidel get most of his
guns from?

Well, you know...
To lead the revolution?

Right, you know, so forth. That's a story which we
won't have to go into and so forth because we just
(unintelligible) briefly over it. And then there
came a period of time where Fidel in all his
popularity and so forth was, now Fidel with you - he
made approaches to you, right, and so forth?

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 241


FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

Hom.

He told you he loved you and so forth.

-Yes.

And he seduced you, right? And, which has been on
record,

Mm-Hmm.

You know, and you liked him and you actually in
liking him like a young girl thought for the future
that here's a man that I, you admired, that you
started to get an affection for him and so forth,
and really you thought of marriage, right?

Mn-hmm.

And in the process of being close with him, being as
the man's intelligent, dynamic and so forth, he did
force his attentions on you and naturally he seduced
you. You didn't want to but it happened.

Yes.

And you had nobody to go to because, hey, you're in™
his Cuba, right?

I was in his Cuba alright.

Right, now also what we were getting in this Senate
Intelligence Committee has got is the things that
Fidel has stated against the United States government
if they tried to interfere with the revolution and so
forth when the new election time comes because at that
time the President of the United States was Eisenhower
and it looked like that the Democrats were going to
win the election and he felt that if a new government,
which was discussed among the top military people, if
the new government came in and if they decided that they
didn't like Fidel's policy, which Fidel was saying what
he was going to do for Cuba on an international scale,
that if the United States government decided to go and
turn against him and put pressure on him he would do
likewise to the United States government. ‘And he was
going to export his revolution in Latin America. These
are the things that you heard...

We won't go into anything else. We'll go ahead and
jump past that. Then we lost contact with you, right?

And in losing contact with you we, well we mentioned
sometime when they, the United States State Department

with the case agent in 1969.

FS: 1969. Who was the case agent's name, and what federal
agents, you already told me. You already told me and
they got it on record and this...

ML: They told.me not to say anything.

FS: Well, honey, they got it on record and you're gonna
go ahead and send this down there because Senator

agent that you were in touch with.

and...
FS: Honey, you're not embarassing the Bureau. What you're

doing is giving this information to Senator Baker's
Committee to turn over to the Justice Department in
order for them to go ahead and say, hey - you worked
as an agent for them, also as a double agent, you need

protection for you and your kid, and if you don't go
ahead and tell them the name of these here people how
you gonna do it?

Mmm.

You know we get back to the same thing again. Yeah,
you're looking for protection. So far the people
you've worked with, so.far this man Pucci who you
saved his life, and saved another undercover agent's
life whose working with the FBI. These people are
powerful people yet they have done nothing with the
problem that you have had right now with you, three
times there's been an attempt on your life, isn't
that correct? One time they almost threw you out of
an 18 story building. Another time you got pistol-
whipped. You did all this crap for these people
here yet they will do nothing to go ahead at the
present time, and this is on record in their own
files and so forth, yet you cannot move them to give
you or your children any protection. This piece of
tape is going to go right to Senator Baker's office,
it'll go to Howard Liebengood for him to listen to,
to evaluate it and turn this tape over to the proper
authorities which will be the Justice Department.
You can call Howard Liebengood.to see if he has
received those codes from the Albanian Embassy from
me. You can call him and find out, and also you

can call him at the same time and let him know if

a tape has. been turned over to him. As a matter of
fact when I get there Friday and leave this in his
office I will instruct his people in the office to
get a hold of you, because I'm gonna leave your phone
number with Senator's Baker's people, with Senator
Baker is on, has a Committee on Intelligence...

Mm-hmm.

He's got the committee. It's a new Committee that has
been. formed on intelligence. See, now I am turning this
information over to the proper authorities. See. And
this information is not going to go to any newspaper
or anybody...

Okay, okay Frank. I have your word. It's just that I
got a hang-up, you know I guess, with them working on
practically all my adult life. :

They were like a family, they were like a family at

a lot of nights in the garbage looking for Albanian
stuff, cost me.a lot of worry, cost me a lot of fear,
threats.

Alright so this is why...
(Unintelligible)

I want some stuff on this thing because if you make a
story up then how are you gonna prove, for instance,
you gonna go ahead...

No I'm not making anything up. I wouldn't lie about
it.

No, no, honey, I'm just saying. If you're gonna go
ahead and say, hey - I broke into 33, in an apartment
building with. 33 Soviet families, who. did you work
for -- well’I worked for the FBI. They call the FBI,
ai FBI said we know nothing about it. Then you are
a lar.

No way am I going to be a liar.

I'm just saying, they're going to say how we gonna
protect this girl when. she's lying to us because the
FBI says no.. But if you name names. and say I worked
with this man here, it's got my file, I worked over

a six year period. God dam it - that, that Justice
Department will say, hey baby we want to see you and
we want to see your files on this girl. And baby
they got to go and come up with it. And if they don't
come up with it they're in trouble. They're in
trouble. Now, how could they hide something when they
are working for the same people who are their bosses,
who are their bosses? They can tell you to go jump in
a lake over here. But Washington, D. C. says - hey,

I want to see.something here. Why haven't you given
this people protection if all this is true. But if
they don't know, honey, how the hell are they gonna

250 East 87th Street, the Newberry, owned by Glenwood
Management, which are crooked, and that's on the
corner of 2nd Avenue, it's called the Newberry.
Okay, now, who started to move in there?

Our very first tenant was Mr. Ovinikoff, he was the
First Secretary to Ambassador Malek at the United
Nations. (unintelligible)

Alright, go ahead, keep talking into there.

And he's a little guy. He seemed like normal people,
but I never really...

Well how many people eventually moved in there besides
this man?

Oh well the first one was Mr. Ovinikoff, the second
one I named The Stalker, the third one - I have nick-

FS: Yeah, but

ML: Moonface, The Stalker...

FS: Yeah.

ML: The Shadow. It was my own little thing of remembering
until I memorized. We started out with the tenants’
list.

FS: Alright, how many people were on the tenants’ list?

ML: We had, the building consisted of 300 units, which
300 apartments, my husband had access to files. Each
Soviet file read the same -- Permanent Mission of the

:%Union. of Soviet Socialist Republic resident, and I
got interested. Then one day an agent came at 9 o'clock
in the morning, and my husband had been previously
working with Treasury and other agencies, including
this agent which I'll name, that's Al Chestone.

FS: His first name was what?

ML: Albert, Albert Chestone.

FS: What agency was he with?

ML: The FBI.

FS: Special Agent, FBI?

ML: Yes, counterintelligence.

FS: Sector of the FBI

ML: Yes, political. And, my husband had known him

previously working with the Polaris missile, Polaris
missile thing. This was before I met my husband or
married him. He did something with the Polaris
missile thing. And my husband was paid by this same
agent. Anyway, we, he came daily and we went over the
tenants' list and we sort of dissected everybody in
the building.

FS: Alright now, were you recruited by this agent?

ML: Yes, he said are you willing to work and I said, well,
why not? He said it doesn't consist of much, a few
sail (laughter)...

them, and you take the woman's viewpoint, standpoint,

And they.wanted you to do some burglaries, right?
Well, I, yes.

Alright now, these burglaries, did they consist of
you and your husband doing the burglaries or you by
yourself?

Well my husband had the master keys.
Right, alright.

And...

Well when you did these burglaries...

We all did them together. They're were about 5, 6,

7 cars. One stationed in front of the Soviet Mission.
Suppose, say like they were interested in one Soviet
who they lost track of, who was supposed to be in
Washington, D. C., and then they found him all of a
sudden in our building because they had surveillance
across the street. That's the first thing - they set
up surveillance, a camera, high-power camera across
the street. That we were pointed out to, That
everybody who went in and out of the building was
photographed.

Including yourself and your husband?

Oh yeah,me especially in the morning taking my son to

out they weren't in the apartments?

Well, they would...

FS: Would you knock on the door or something?

and I looked at him but it was still in the best
interests of the country, and this was a very, very top
KGB agent, a Soviet General, blah, blah, blah, he was

It could be very dangerous.

Yeah, yeah, I said...

You could get caught, you could be killed.

I said suppose, you know, we're working in the precinct
on a local level - that's breaking and entering, right?
And my husband and I dis, you know we discussed it.
Now, Uncle Al - as we started to call this...

FBI agent?

FBI agent, said "Look, he's a very bad person, we lost
him and we found him and he's in the building and we
want to get in the apartment. We feel he has, for
national security reasons, we want to enter that
apartment. Louis, will you.cooperate?" You know?

And my husband said, "Alright".

Did he said he had to discuss it with you?

They discussed it in front of me.

I mean did your husband say he had, he would discuss
it with you about...

No, no, but he did, but he didn't ask me because I
asked my husband later,.I said, "Louis, if you refuse
to do what Al tells us to do, me as a lookout and
Louis opening the doors for them'', Louis said, Louis
is my husband, said "What. do you want me to do, get
subpoenaed? They'll subpoena me if I don't do it. So
I'll go along with it."

So it, it was agreed...

It was agreed that he would do it.

Alright, now what did your husband do. Did he open the
door for the agents?

Yes he did.
Did he go in, for what, one agent, two agents?
Two agents.

Two agents. Was Uncle Al one of those agents?

Page 256


-24-

ML: No he was not.

FS: Do you know the name of the two agents that made the
entry?

ML: No I do not.

FS: Do not.

ML: They came on the specific morning when they had Oleg...

FS: You were by Uncle Al that these two agents
were coming?

ML: Yes.

FS: Alright, on a specific morning?

ML: Yes.

FS: Alright, and...

ML: They came as lumberjacks, one as a refrigeration
repairman.

FS: Right.

ML: Refrigerator, refrigeration-air conditioning repairman.

FS: Alright, now you and your husband with these two

agents went up.to the 10th floor, right? You were
stationed where you. were going to be the lookout?

Right.

The fact that he is the manager of the building
standing there with two repairman.

But that he was assured, he was assured, right.

That these two men were repairmen?

That, that just in case. something went. wrong with the
5 cars assigned to this job that one car would radio
that Oleg Likichev was leaving the Mission at this
moment, he is getting into his car, he is on the way
up 2nd Avenue to his residence.

Right, and they...

You've got approximately 7 to 8 minutes...

Minutes to do what you gott do and get the hell out.
Do, and get out.

Okay.

So, my husband stood in the door and I was in the
staircase and they went in with a,:a case that looks
like a television repair case which had high power
cameras.

Right.

And they, my husband was always annoyed because they
were sloppy.

The Soviets are very trained, they would leave a
cigarette on an ashtray. If you knocked it over they
know immediately someone was in. the apartment.

Now, when the agents, before your husband opened the
door with the pass key, did the agents look the door
over to see if there was any powder marks, tapes,
hairs, or anything, or something leaning against the
door to signify that possibly when the Cuban general,
this, not Cuban general, this Russian general, who is
a top KGB agent...

Yes.

wanted to see if somebody made an entry they would
leave something on the door.

Yes.

They inspected the door, right? And they didn't find
anything?

Right.

Right. So they opened the door. In other words, what-
ever they touched...

But they made-a mistake inside on one break-in and
that...

Alright, now, no let's not jump. We're, you were on
this one particular thing.

Alright.

These people did go in, they did what they had to do
with the cameras and.so forth, evidently these were
hidden...

You don't know for sure, though?

I'm not sure, my husband...

No, but you do know about the cameras?

Yes. :

Alright, but there is a possibility they brought
bugging devices because it's logical they would
bring bugging devices.

I think sometimes, plenty of times they wanted to
plant a bug.

Sure.

Well they install that through the walls and so forth.

FS: Yeah. Alright, now, how long did they stay in, to
the General's apartment?

ML: In the apartment, approximately 10-15-20 minutes.

FS: Then they left, your husband closed the door, did he
wipe his fingerprints off the door? Do you know?

ML: No, but my husband would-usually put the edge of the
rug back the way he found it.

FS: Right, in other, everything...

ML: It was turned over...

about other entries. We'll get one at a time.

The other entry that's outstanding is Soviet..

Yeah, go ahead, keep talking.

Very Americanized Soviet, handsome, married with a 10
year old daughter. I forget his name. I have them
all at home. . And, I nicknamed him "The Tennis Player"
because he use to do a lot of jogging and play tennis
every morning to make contacts with Americans, and try

time.. He spoke English without an...

Alright, it makes no difference. Alright, don't

worry about that. But they made entry into his
apartment.

Yes.

What did they do in his apartment?

I guess they microfilmed and planted a device. Anyway,

detective. I was working up there and the detectives
were hot. on a homicide and I answered the phone and
here it was the tennis player calling to make a formal

had him on the phone.

And he didn't know it was you.

In other words,

We had, in one day about four different agencies
watching people.

In and out of the building.

And we didn't know if we were coming or going.

Yeah.

We lived on the second floor. We had a view of the
street and we would signal to the, across the street
surveillance apartment, apartment, you know. We'd
see the cars pull up and the cars leave.

Alright, now...

My husband did most of, he'd been doing it.

He'd been doing most of the end of the...

Yes, because I felt I didn't want to get caught. I
just didn't want to get caught because it was a heck
of a chance because more than one Soviet family lived
on one floor. and if anyone of them walked out when ny
husband was opening the door to let those guys in my

medicine and I just didn't want anything to go wrong.

But your husband.continued to work with the agency,
right?

Yes. We, we took, we ID'd photos. We watched for
cars. We watched their movement. It was day and night.

You did a lot of surveillance work on these people
but you yourself, personally, wanted to try to keep
out of the...

Yeah.

operation as far as...

Break...

entering into the apartments, right?

Yes.

How long did this last?. Over a period of how long?
1969 to 1976.

All these years?

Yes.

That's doing surveillance on these people.

Yeah. We were...

How about the Albanians now, tell me about the code.
The Albanians, the Albanians we got very friendly with
a Mr. Koyani, Ambassador to the Mission, the U.N., and
the Albanians are not as elite as the Russians are.
The Russians dry clean their own clothes, burn their
own garbage, have no photos, personal things in the
apartment. The Albanians are more, they allow their
children to watch television. The Soviets don't. We
convinced the Albanians who had a mission on their
mission, which. they blocked a complete fire exit was

on the 21st floor of the Newberry. They lived in the
apartments on the 20th floor. and the 22nd floor. And

they had about 30, 30 families who-resided there and
their mission was there. And we became very friendly
with them because of one incident, especially my
husband, took, went to see his mother and left me in
‘charge of the building. That'same day they had a so-
called demonstration where the demonstrators had a
25-minute picketing right to picket. .The demonstra-
tion turned into a bloody riot where they burned flags
and everything and the Albanians came down. They all
are armed. They're all armed, and they agitated the
rioters out on the street. And I was alone with only
my basic police training and my wits, really, and a
panicking doorman and my kids. I was just alone. I,
the first thing I looked out the window when I heard
the shooting I called the Bureau and I said, "Get me
Al Chestone fast."' I said I don't have Louis here.
I said I need help. I have a demonstration. I don't
know what to do. And there were about 500 people
throwing bricks, bottles, everything through the plate
glass windows. Burning American flags and Albanian
flags because of something that happened in Albania.
Those that defected here. started this demonstration.
So. then I, things got out of hand, the doorman was
hurt with a brick. I saw blood, and the Albanian
Ambassador and five top officials agitated these
people from inside the lobby with fists. Very
unprofessional-like.

Yeah.

So I physically pulled them by their coats and told
them, "Get upstairs, get upstairs and get yourself
back into the mission", because tenants were walking
through the lobby and we were going to get hurt by
flying glass and everything else. And I had no help.
The police were outside of the line...

Marita, what we're going into details. is something
that is a story.

Oh, alright.
So we'll go ahead and just bypass that.

Anyway, the Albanians Al was interested into, and

especially because they were admitting the Red Chinese
into the United Nations, which they did. It was that
speech, which I have the original copy of. Ambassador
Rocco Nocco - sounds crazy, but that's his name, Rocco

Nocco, and they were, they were sloppier, and the
agent Al Chestone told me convince them, you know,
case ‘em, keep going up and down the steps, what
time they throw their garbage out. Garbage was
the most valuable source of information for the
Bureau, and that was...

Garbage and trash.

Trash. Chicken bones, codes, diapers, whatever, you
know, and that was my job because I had the patience.
Now the FBI supplied me with bandaids and gloves,
flashlights, batteries and the whole thing, because

I convinced the Albanians that the compacter, which
was the disposal system in the building from 31 floors
down -- in other words when they threw their garbage
out that it would come out in brick form, block form,
brick crushed, which in fact was not true.

But: they believed it?

They believed it. They trusted us. Louis and I were
the only ones allowed in the mission. We were the
only ones.

Now this mission is that building you were talking
about.

That's still there.

Still there.

Very much there. That's the code that you have.
Right.

So, I started, made it a every two hour routine to go
after midnight when they put their garbage out in the
hall, pick up the bags. Take them down to the service
entrance and take the bags at home, take ‘em home.

And go through the orange peels and chicken bones and
gather torn up letters, this was before they got smart
and bought a shredder (unintelligible). And I would
turn this garbage letter, in other words, I would
past it together and give it to the Bureau and some
of these letters turned out to be very valuable. Among
them was one code, now...

FS:

I would assume that these letters that were in code
they would be classified material. Otherwise it
wouldn't be in. code.

Very valuable, yes. The...
And this was turned over to who?

To Al Chestone. The first code I got, I just got on
a hunch lucky. Because it was just at. the time when
the Red Chinese entered the United States, first
came here. Mr. Huang Yua, and I met them. We met
them first before anybody met them, Louis and I.

And that same night the code came down at 3:00 in ‘the
morning and I just had a hunch and I got up and I
said, "Louis I can't sleep, I'm going down and do
some work. Give me the keys to the compacter room."
So I went downstairs and I waited and sure enough
around 3:30 these bags started to come down from the
21st floor.

3:30 in the morning?

3:30 in the morning because Al said watch them
closely, because of the Red Chinese. And I shut
the machine off and I got these, I got this code,
I caught it in other words, but it...

This is the code you turned over to me?

This is the first code, the very first code, at the
risk of having my hands chopped off because if I
didn't shut that machine off in time I could have
been hurt. But I.got it. The first code was very

_valuable. It was sent to Washington.

(End of tape - side 2).

...these bags of stuff and if you hadn't have turned
off the machine you would have got your hand either
chopped up or cut off, and so forth. What did, were
you saying about Al, Uncle Al?

Uncle Al slept and I did the work, and by the time I
got upstairs and took the orange peels and everything
out of the garbage and separated the letters and '

every tiny little piece with tweezers and everything,

put it all in a box, right down to every piece. I
ruined my rugs and everything. And Uncle Al would
come at 8:30, 9:00 in the morning and I would still
be up separating the garbage and he'd be.all fresh
and ready for work and I had just come back from the
garbage room. And...

You stayed awake all night?

Yeah, with the tweezers and I use. to run out of
skotch tape which was frustrating cause I couldn't
stick these letters togethers without skotch tape,

so he brought me a big box of skotch tape which

was very kind of him. Then I would give it to him
and he'd, he'd have coffee, tea and toast or whatever.
And I'd say, "Now I want to go to sleep." And he'd
say, "No, no, no, wait a minute. Mr. So-and-so,

or Berzofsky, we want to get a line on Mr. Berzofsky.

Who was Mr. Berzofsky?

Berzofsky, the Second Secretary to the Union of the
Soviet Socialist Republic.

What was his. first name, do you know?
Mmmm, I forgot...
That's alright, it don't matter.

I forgot really. But we were very close to him. His
wife was a surgeon in the Soviet mission and she was,
she's, she's adorable. She's nice, she's sweet and
she has a lovely daughter, Irene, who turned out to
have liver cancer. She was a little girl when I first
met her, like my daughter. My daugher played with her,
they took piano lessons together, exchanged books, and
the little girl; at sixteen, Irene was sent back to
the Soviet Union with liver cancer. I got very close
to the mother, the mother was heartbroken, the father
was heartbroken. I guess like any mother and father
when their only child turns out to have liver cancer.
She's diagnosed as such in the Soviet Union and they
asked me to get medicine, pain killers for Irene. I
do so and pass along to them empirin and codine #4,
which is a pain killer which they smuggled over to

their daughter on with the permission of
the FBI. We exchanged jewelry, clothes, and everything
else. We were just one mother to another mother.

Their little girl in trouble, mine not in trouble and
it was little things like that that I would get very
involved with. TI don't know...

Morita let me ask you this here, did the agents ever
tell you to go out with any of the diplomats in the
mission?

Well, now.we have to go back to Oleg, Oleg Likichev.
And who is he again?

He was the KGB spy that they lost and. thought he, they
thought he was still residing in Washington, the out-
side of Washington, D. C., in Virginia. He was
supposed to have last been seen in Virginia somewhere
and all of a sudden they picked him up in our building,
as being in our building. They.lost him and they were
furious, the Bureau, and they wanted us very close to
him. And he, we had:a’lot of evenings together we
spent with him, dinners, and he came to us,

In other words he asked you to go out, did he ask
(unintelligible)

Well, Oleg, Oleg, let's just say, I don't know if it
was a game. they were playing or if they were doubles
or what. They talked a lot about the State of
Washington, residing in the State of Washington.
They also. knew I had diamonds and he asked me,
(unintelligible) "Can you get me diamonds?"

What did he call you?
Ilonka Marischa, Ilona Marita.
Oh, that's in Russian?

Yes. And we always exchanged Russian words and I
know a few, enough to get by on. All of a sudden,
you know, he was interested in diamonds. He had a
fascination for diamonds. His wife, she was kind
of sweet on my husband he was kind of sweet on me
and I kept telling Uncle Al this thing is going to
get out of hand. I said all of a sudden he wants

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 273


ay

diamonds, and Al, what do I do. Go ahead, talk to
him about diamonds. So I said Oleg, what do you
mean by diamonds? He said uncut stones for cash.

I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry
store like you and buy them. -I want diamonds. I'm
willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for them.

I said,-I said tell me why, Oleg. And he said,
“Money, why does anybody want diamonds."" I said it's
a good enough reason. So I said, "Hey, Louis, what
can we do for Oleg about his diamonds?" And Louis
said we'll figure something out. And then Oleg said,
this was at a dinner party up in their house. Hot
diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So

he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he
would buy them for cash.

FS: . How serious was he? Did you’ ever get any for him?

“ML: Well it got this far. We told Uncle Al the next
morning. I said, "Uncle Al, I got a surprise for
you. You're gonna have to come up with some hot
diamonds. A hundred. thousand dollars worth because
I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since
he can't buy them. Oleg wants diamonds." And I
said if you can put two and two together maybe this
guy will defect because he's talking about the State
of Washington. I said but you have to be careful,
I have to be careful, no? So Al said I'll get you
the diamonds. You tell him to get the cash ready.
So Uncle Al went to an underworld source and got
the diamonds. Uncle Al made a boo-boo and Oleg, the
day of the exchange I was supposed to make the sale
in itthe.apartment, Oleg was at a sports meeting in
Washington,D.C. Uncle Al said, "I've got to give
these diamonds back to the underworld. or give them
the cash." I said, "Listen, I told you tomorrow,
not today, Al. Tomorrow, because Oleg told us he's
going to this soccer. meeting in Washington, D.C. _
Alright whatever the kind of meeting it is. He is
in Washington, D. C." "Oh is he?" I said, "Yes,
he is." Right. Anyway, Uncle Al started to panick
because ‘he was in my house with a hundred thousand
dollars worth of uncut, hot diamonds.

FS: By himself?

ML: By himself, and I was supposed to.get the cash from
Oleg. Oleg said on a Thursday and Uncle Al came on

a Wednesday and the whole thing...
So what happened?

fell through. Al said he had to give them back to
the underworlds, to his source. So he took them
back and then Oleg, you know, I had to talk my

way out of it. It was just one of the flubs. But
anyway after I left my husband Oleg kept asking for
me, kept coming directly to the apartment and say-
ing, "Louis, I don't believe you two split, you two
go, she left. I don't believe it." And my. husband
said "yes, she did leave. It's her own problems,
Oleg, you know, forget about it." And he said,
"No, it's not possible. You must stay together.
You must stay. together." Anyway, he kept coming,
about four times and asking my husband, until. my
husband made a joke of it and said Oleg wants to
see you. I mean he's made it dam plain that he
wants to see you. In other words if you're
finished I'll take over. Where is she living? My
husband tells him I'm living on 88th Street. Now

I talked to my husband and I said what did you do
that for? Tell him I'm living on.88th Street?

You know, because I know he wants to go out with
me. You can feel it, I can feel it, the, you know?
So I call up,Uncle Al meantime is transferred to
Newark, I get another case agent. Louis gets a
case agent for the building and he works alone,
without me. The other agent is John Kotter.

With the FBI?

FBI, 69th Street. I call up John Kotter. I said,
"John, I hear your taking Al's place", and I meet
him. Drop things, start things, drop things,
different assignments, then we get to Oleg. I said
look, Oleg is bothering Louis. He wants to go out
with me. And John Kotter says, "Beautiful, that is
a beautiful setup. Let's call him up." I said,
“Hey, wait a minute. Either do this sophisticated,
alright? . First I'll send him a Christmas card and
sign it Ilonka Marischa, you know? I'll put ny
phone number on the bottom, something you know?

Or I'll happen to be|there when he's going into the
building, or I'll bump into him." I said you don't
just call him up. You know that's going to be like
a setup because I've/been avoiding him. So, anyway,
he tells, he outlines the whole thing.. I said what
have you got: planned, John. And he says, "Do you

And I'm in the middle. So, anyway; I go, I go to the
mission with my daughter, who was at the time 12 years
old. My daughter, I guess, is a little use to my
life. She's use to FBI all her life. She knows not
to talk. She knows whether we look at her when to
say something. I guess she's the closest thing to me
now. She goes along. She's very cool and we both
walked into the mission on the pretense that she had
to do a project for school on the Soviet Union. She
needed material. Now as soon as we walked into‘the
mission everybody there I know because they reside in
the building. - And they all say, "Ilonka Marischa
blah, blah, blah, blah."" And I'm very friendly with
them all. They all love my daughter. But we're
there for other reasons. We're there to go to see
Oleg. We gather, we gather the material, meanwhile
I'm aware that every picture has an eye or every
poster has a mirror or camera, you know? But my
daugher's very cool and we're left alone in the room
where the Soviet material is displayed. But I know
we're being watched. She knows it too and she
doesn't, she says, "Mommy, look, this is beautiful,
beautiful."" You know? Then I ask for Oleg to this
very, very tough Soviet woman that said "What you
want?", you know. I said "Oleg Likichev, please.

I'd like to speak to him." And she called and he

is still in the United Nations, he asks you to wait.
I refused a wire or anything like that, but...

What wire are you talking about?

A wire on me.

Oh.

Because...

That the agents (unintelligible)

Yes, because Oleg I know likes me and if he sees me
he would grab me and hug me and that's the Russian
way...

Yeah.

And he'll feel that and I'm dead.

Right.

Right in the mission. That's not my proper there.

Right.

-45-

And I wouldn't risk it with my daughter. So, anyway,
we waited. We were allowed the run of the place. We
knew everyone there and...

Like you say, eyes were watching you.

Oh definitely, definitely, because that's how they
test you when you walk in there. And you just don't
get in there and have the run of the place, you're
not left alone. But I know you're being watched.

Sure.

Anyway, there was this, it was, it was a legitimate
excuse that Oleg was tied up in the United Nations
because it was in the paper the next day, that it
was some security council meeting. And I said
"Please give this note to Mr. Likichev. Tell him
thank you. very much for the material. And best
wishes to his wife, blah, blah, blah," and we left.
Funny thing is the cop outside almost arrested us,
a uniformed police officer.

For what reason?

He gave us a dirty look and made a very slurring,
nasty remark when I left. But I hate to knock the
police department because they're helping me now.
But, I guess, he didn't know, you know?

Yeah, he thought you were. Russians.

He thought I was a Russian.

Or a Russian sympathizer.

Right, especially ‘going in with a child and I looked
very...

Yeah.

American. Anyway,.I got home and John Kotter was
waiting in front of my door. I remember it was
raining. He was reading. And I said, he said "Are

you going to meet Oleg?" I said, "Now how the hell
can I make a date with Oleg with my daughter?"

Yeah.

Page: 277


-46-,

ML: I said Oleg's in the United Nations. Why don't you
tell me these things before that they're delayed at
a security council meeting, you know, instead of me
letting, letting me sit there. You know these are
all the little things that use to annoy me...

FS: * Yeah.

ML: that they have to screen things first before, you
know - check things out, don't have to make a blunder
like that. Anyway, I said I left Oleg a note. I
said now you go home and I'm going to take it easy
and they, we tried, and I said, "You know, John,
you're just going to get me so involved with Oleg.
I'm not going to end up in bed in a motel room
upstate somewhere with Oleg so you can come in and
take photographs. That's not my stick." I said
I'll gather garbage, get license plates, tape, do
everything else, but, I'll even take the mail, like
I've been doing, but I'm not going to be caught in
bed. I said that's too big a pawn for me and I'm
not getting anything for it right now. They allowed
me to take mail, steam it, photograph it and put it
back. Some of that mail is now missing, which
belongs to the Soviet people, which this perpetrator,
perpetrator has and wants to blackmail me with and I
asked the FBI to please help me with that.

FS: Who's the perpetrator?

ML: The perpetrator is Guiseppi Faisiano, aka Pionne,
aka David Ring, who broke into my apartment and stole
this tape with Oleg Likichev, these love conversations,
the mail, and part of the Albanian code. He has those
in his possession. He threatens my life with it. He
threatens blackmail with me. He assaulted me. He
pistol-whipped me and I asked the Bureau for help.

FS: Did he try to throw you out the 18 story build-, window?
ML: Yes.

FS: He did what?

ML: i Yes, he tried to push me out the window.

FS: 18 stories?

ML: Yes, and I told him stay away, get back, because if

anything happens to me there's letters with the
Justice Department naming everything I know about you,

and he stopped cold. He threatened to shoot my
daughter in the back. He's threatening her right
now with disgrace because she is the daughter of
the, of a well-known man. Right now my main concern
is the, these letters and the code and the tape and
possibly other things, are in the hands of this
Guiseppi Faisiano, and he wants money from me and
he's probably right now at the building. He is
casing the Soviets and he's going to try to go to
the same people that he has on the letters to tell
them that I was an informant for the FBI for revenge,
for having him arrested onthe assault charge with a
gun. He also wants money. He wants to disgrace the
FBI. He's blackmailing right now my husband, my ex-
husband, for the master keys of the Newberry. My
husband is calling me for help and I don't know what
to do. I asked Frank to help me. I gave him the
code because everybody refused. I was afraid to have
any-, anywhere. I guess Frank helped me before in
Cuba and I don't, I worked, he worked for me and I
worked for him and I don't know where to go because,
the only ones that are helping me now are the local
police - in their lunch hours or when I'm too afraid
to leave the house they buy me milk and fruit for the
kids. And they'll take the children home when I get
a threat on the phone or a box in the mailbox or get
my back door shot at. I take my children and I put
them in the 23rd precinct.

They even, off duty...

The off-duty police, police officers take my children
home...

And they spend time at the house?

And they spend time at the house in their free time
when they should be home with their families.

Well you have saved the life of two people, right?
I would think so.

Well, you have.

Yes.

When, one of the, who are the two people you saved
their lives?

FS: Undercover agent, right?

ML: Undercover agent Pino Cantanya, and Assistant Federal
District Attorney Thomas A. Puccio from Brooklyn.

FS: And you saved their lives because a contract was
being put out on them?

ML: vee because I overheard and everything I said checked
out.

FS: And even though you have saved their lives...

ML: I asked them please help me with this man, he has

Soviet documents, he's hurt me, he's hurt my

children, he almost shot my daughter. He, I asked
them please help me because I gave you information

for nothing and they said they promised to do something
on this individual immigration-wise. So far he has
threatened everybody around me. My physicians, my
mother, my ex-husband, my children, my neighbors, my

super.

FS: He's an illegal immigrant?

ML: He is. I would say he's an illegal alien.

FS: What's his full name, his real name?

ML: His arrest name, that he was arrested under was

Guiseppi Faisaino. He has, he's also known as David
Ring. He has a passport under this name. He's also
known as Pinno, and he is a gunman. Never worked a
day in his life, never paid taxes, he's a gambler,
he's a stick-up man and I worked for the FBI on
organized crime. at the racetrack. Roosevelt Raceway,
Yonkers, and...

FS: Any other agencies?

I did some work in the Newberry with my husband
with them involving the Cuban narcotics connection
in South America. I also worked with the organized
crime, gambling.

Now you've turned, you want me to turn this tape
over to Senator Baker's committee to be turned over
to the Justice Department, is that correct? Right?

Yes.
You want me turn the...

Yes, I would like you, Frank, to turn this over just
in case something happens to me because I don't know
which way it's going to come,

And you need some protection, right now, right?

I need some type of help for my. children, because of
this man Pinno threatening to expose my dealings with
the FBI and to the foreign press. I just caught up
in this thing since 1959 and I've been with it up
until last month, last week and I've just, and I need
help. There is no help. I mean since last month and
I don't want my children hurt. They've already been
hurt.

Alright, I promise to turn this tape and the code over
to Senator Baker's. committee, right?

Yes.

Who in turn will turn the information over to the
proper officials in Washington, D. C.

Yes. I don't mean to embarass the Bureau. I know how
important it is but at this point I need help
desparately for my kids. They're 6 and 14 and they
don't deserve what they have to go through. The
whole summer locked up, threatened and afraid, and
my daughter of exposure.

Dear Senater Mansfield:

Geergs Bush's letter to Senater Hugh Scott, with a copy te
you, of tha 2nd of June is disturbingly ambigueus. In stating
thee the CIA agw believes itself relieved of the resppasibilicy
of saintaining data "whieh ware subjest to imvastigation by che
Reckafeller Commiseion. and the Select Combittes,” the Agency
failed te meke eny effort to identify whet aaterials ware targeted
for destruction and which weren't. Further, the next te last
sentence of Mr. Bush's letter, "I trust you (Senater Scott) egrea
that this ection is new necessery and appropriate, and I would
appreciate your confimmetion of this understanding,“ rio per
some observers in the Senate to conclude ne dsstruction will
take place until such demfirmation wa been given. This does
not appeag to be trus. Neither the press effice ner the lagia-
lative would coafims thet destruction ef date hes not
alzeady eccurred, er would set occur without acquisence from the
Senate leedership. Te the contrary, the aol agri cgunsel'a
office informed thts group that the “process” of destruction has
already begun.

The action of the Central Intelligence Ageacy is wrong.
The new Select Comittee on Intelligence should have been
consulted price to the destruction of any materials which might
be vital co che proper functioning of thet committee and which
in aay case age cithin the legisletive und ovexeight densia of
thae coamites® Chaizman Inouye and Vice-Chairmsn Baker, (yom
with the eambership of the Intelligence Cemmittes should heave
the opportuniey te review the data selected for deetxection and
to determine, in conjunction with the CIA, thegprogriaty of
destroying ex maintaining such data.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

We have received a letter from the Honorable George Bush,
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, relative to the destruc-
tion of papers and material which he has held for sometime relative
to our request. Our action was taken to facilitate the inquiry being
undertaken by your predecessor committee under the chairmanship of
Senator Frank Church.

In view of the fact, as we assume, that all of Senator
Church's committee records have been turned over to your permanent
Select Committee, we would appreciate your advising us as to whether
or not you want ow original letter to stand and the papers and other
materials to still be held. Could you give us the judgment of you
and your Committee on this matter?

With best wishes, we are

WASHINGTON,D.G, 20505

2 June 1976 |

Honorable Mike Mansfield

. United States Senate
Office of the Majority Leader
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Mansfield:

On 27 January 1975, following adoption’ of S, Res, 21 creating the
Select Committee on Intelligence, you and Senator Hugh Scott requested
that the Central Intelligence Agency “not destroy, remove from [its]. pos-
session or control, or otherwise dispose or permit the disposal of any
records or documents which might have a bearing on the subjects under
investigation, including but not limited to all records or documents per~
taining in any way to the matters set out in section 2 of S. Res. 21."

In response to this request, the Agency placed in effect a complete
moratorium on the destruction of records, including normal administrative
records scheduled for routine destruction. :

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that it is our intention to !
proceed with destruction ‘of records, now that the Select Committee has
completed its investigation and issued its final report. We have so advised
Senator Church.

Along with the backlog of routine administrative records, the Agency
will destroy records which were collected and maintained by the Agency A
and which were subject to investigation by the Rockefeller Commission
and the Select Committee. The Agency is required to destroy much of
this latter material by the Privacy Act of 1974 (P. L. 93-579) and by
Executive Order 11905. Of course, all records destruction will be fully
consistent with other applicable laws, Presidential directives, and the
requirements of pending litigation and Justice Department investigations.

I trust you agree that this action is now necessary and appropriate,
and I would appreciate your confirmation of this understanding.

I am sending a duplicate of this letter to Senator Hugh Scott.

‘ . : Sincerely,

A

Dear Senator Mansfield:

fou may recall that some weeks ago you were kind enough to arrange a

meeting between myself and ir. William Miller, of the staff of the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence. You arranged this meeting for me so that I could
present documents, which I showed you, relating to possible CIA illegal activ-
ities in Indochina. Specifically, as you know, I have long been interested in
the problem of who carried out the massive defoliation raids against Cambodia,
one year prior to the U.4, incursions into that country and during a time when,
formally, there were normal relations between the United States and the Royal
government of Cambodia. After talking with you about the matter, I met, for
» about one-half hour, with Mr. Miller and showed him the documents I showed you.
“ He made some notes and assured me that the question. of possible illegal activ-
ities of the CIA in Indochina, including Cambodia, was on the agenda of his
committee. Sometime ago, I wrote ir. ililler to find out when he expected the
committee might look into Indochina. However, as has been the case since
‘ugust,.with_respect to communications from this comnittee, I have as yet re-
ceived no answer, not even an acknowledgement of receipt. I have just read
in the press that the Senate Intelligence Committee expects again to look at
Chile, Cuba, etc., but there is no indication of any interest in Indochina.
I would greatly appreciate your help in learning whether, in fact, the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence will look into possible illegal coWert opera-
tions of '.5, intelligence agencies in Indochina. I would also appreciate
your views as to what I should do to get an investigation of the massive clan-
destine herbicide attack on Cambodia (1969), This was a unique operation in
technological history of foreign relations and as a biologist I ain most inter-
ested and concerned to get the full story on this bizarre incident. if the
Senate “elect Committee will not ask obvious questions of the intelligence
community, I would greatly appreciate your views on whomI should turn to, to
ask these questions.

I want to thank you again for your hel» on my last trip to Washington. TI
regret that I have to keep bothering you about this matter, but I do hope you
understand my concern, based on my oersonal observations in Indochina, that
the facts about co¥ert operations there be publicdélly determined.

Sincerely yours /

With Respect to Intelligence Activities

Room 607, Capitol Hill Hotel

Washington,-D,C, 20510 - .- i a oe puagsnass

Dear Mr. Miller:

Recently I discussed with Dr. E, W. Pfeiffer, University of Montana
zoologist, an incident in which he has had an abiding concern: the
herbicide attack that occurred in eastern Cambodia in the spring of 77"

1969.-

As I understand it, from my talks with Dr. Pfeiffer andf rom my
review of the correspondence he has received from various agencies,
there is no doubt that the attack actually occurred, that it wag
large and significant, and that the nature of the chemicals and
aircraft involved indicate that the U.S. hada direct role in
carrying it out.

‘! Yet it seems the State and Defense departments, the CIA and the
"private" CIA-affiliate Air America have all denied in one way or
another that they conducted the attack.

The obvious question is who did make the attack? Who ordered it,
why was it ordered and under what authority? Dr. Pfeiffer has
indicated your committee is looking into this matter and that.the
affair may ultimately be discussed in-the. course of Select Committee
hearings at some point.

Is it possible for you to tell me the status of your inauiry? Would
it be anpropriate at this time for our newspaper to interview Dr.

a

a Pfeiffer and write-a news story on the documents he has received,
ia or would such a study bénefit from new information your committee
ae efforts may resurrect within the near future?

ff _Thanks in advance for your interest, We have followed with great

interest the Select Committee efforts to date.

Dear Mr. Miller:

Through the good offices of Senator Mansfield, we met, some
weeks ago to discuss certain problems related to possiblqCIA
activity in Cambodia. As you know,I am particularly interested
in why the CIA cannot or will not find out who carried out the
massive herbicide attack against Cambodia in the spring of 1969.
The CIA has under the Freedom of Information Act provided me
with some documents from my file which bear directly upon this
strange episode and Senator Church's efforts to find out information
for me. When we met you indicated that CIA activities in Indochina
were to be investigated by the Select Comittee. I would greatly
appreciate krowing about when you think this subject will come
up. I would also very much like to submit some of the documents
I have received from the CIA and my personal testimony to the
Committee. I believe that Professor A. Westing and myself were
the last official guests of the Sihanouk regime before it was
temporarily deposed.

I look forward to hearing from you on these matters.

Sincerely yours,

EW.Pfeiffer

When Roselli came up for sentencing, he was represented by Tom

two columns by Jack Anderson that recounted the story of Roselli and Maheu

Nissen, Giancona is in exile somewhere in Mexico.

Nissen never heard about Maheu being questioned in Washington in

that he had never heard of such a meeting. He erie gave me the names of

Subject: Relevance to S. Res. 60 of John Rosselli's Tae
: : testimony about his CIA activities -: - i

John Rosselli and his attorney, Tom Wadden, object to
testifying about Rosselli's involvement with Robert Maheu ina
CIA~financed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in the early 1960's ¢
The objection is based upon national security grounds as well as
an assertion by Mr. Wadden that the material is not relevant to
our inquiry under S. Res. 60.

Testimony of Mr. Rosselli about this matter is relevant
and necessary to our investigation for a variety of reasons.

Facts -fieeen

"" During the last year of the Eisenhower Administration, the
CIA apparently financed and organized a plot to assassinate Fidel
Castro. Among the participants in this plot were Robert Maheu and
John Rosselli. Maheu had a public relations business at the time,
and Rosselli was associated with some alleged organized crime
figures (e.g. Sam Giancana) who had lost substantial gambling
investments when Castro came to Power. Apparently, the plot
continued into the early 1960's even after the abortive Bay of Pigs
invasion, but it failed in attaining its objective of killing Castro.

Only a few officials in the government knew of the exis
tence of the plot at that time. : Be
Justice Department officials stumbled across this infor-
mation about the plot as a result of their investigation into an
illegal wiretap by Sam Giancana in the early 1960's.

The sensitive information was brought to the attention of
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and either he or then-Attomney General

a ‘ Robert Kennedy ordered the prosecution of Giancana dropped in order
not tb compromise national security considerations.

The. Information’ about the alleged assassination plot_ ‘then

lay dormant in'a secret file in the Department of Justice until early
1969; when Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson requested the

file from the Deputy Chief of the Organized Crime Section. The file |
was returned to Central Files s shortly after i it “a taken out.

mey General Wilsén next requested the seaid to
Justice file in early 1971 in connection with his interview of Robert
Maheu on January 27, 1971 (see attached chronology). This interview

at the Department of Justice, in lieu of a grand jury appearance, was
arranged by a telephone call to Attorney General Mitchell on January 19,
1971, only one day after Jack Anderson published his first column linking
both Maheu and Rosselli to the CIA plot to kill Castro. ieee attached)

“However, the significance of Anderson's column on January 18,
1971, was that on the same day, Haldeman requested Dean.to find out
what he could about the Hughes - Maheu - O'Brien relationship.

In the follow-up memos from Caulfield to Dean on the Maheu-
O'Brien link, Caulfield notes Maheu's prior "covert activities" for the
CIA and advises Dean that a check into CIA, FBI, and IRS files on Robert
Maheu is advisable to avoid a “counter-scandal."

In addition, Assistant Attorney General Wilson showed the
sensitive "Castro file” to Attorney General Mitchell, in January, 1971,
and discussed with him the political implications of the information.
Following the on-the-record interview of Maheu on January 27, 1971,
by Lynch, Wilson and Petersen, Maheu was interviewed privately by
Wilson concerning his prior CIA activities with John Rosselli.. Maheu
was not forthcoming with information about the plot at that time.
Attorney General Mitchell discussed the contents of the sensitive file
with President Nixon, according to Wilson, who had advised him to do
so. :

Conclusion:
Therefore, the obsession of the Administration in keeping tabs

on Larry O'Brien in 1971 and 1972 was in part motivated by a fear that
Maheu would impart some of this sensitive information about the plot

to O'Brien, Alternatively the objective was to discover if there was

any information about the plot that might be damaging to the Democrats
that O'Brien might possess from Maheu. And these concerns could

have been a possible motivation for the break-in to the offices of the
DNC and Larry O'Brien by four Cuban-Americans on June 17, 1972, pera

MEMORANDUM

John Rosselli is actually Filippo Sacco, born July 4, 1905,
in Italy of parents Vincenzo and Maria Sacco. Vincenzo Sacco
came to the United States after the birth of Filippo, his oldest
child, and in 1911, Mrs. Sacco and Filippo joined Vincenzo in
the United States where they resided as aliens in East Boston.

Filippo Sacco completed the sixth grade in the public
schools of East Boston and was discharged from school in 1917.
By this time Filippo had two younger brothers and two younger
sisters. In 1918, Vincenzo Sacco died. His wife Maria and the
five children moved into the residence of Liberato Cianciulli
and a daughter was born in 1920. In 1922, Maria and Cianciulli
were married. tee :

In 1922, Filippo had a job driving a horse-drawn milk
wagon and was nicknamed "Milky". However, in addition to his
legitimate occupation, Filippo had made connections with the
criminal element in East Boston and was engaged inrarcotic
traffic with his headquarters in and around Maverick Square.
On September 14, 1922, Filippo sold morphine to a government
informant named Fisher while under surveillance by a narcotic
agent. On September 19, 1922, Filippo arranged for a large
sale from his "source" and was present and under agent sur-
veillance when the morphine was delivered. On September 29,
1922, Filippo Sacco and his "source" were arrested by Federal
narcotics agents. On October 18, 1922, the Federal Grand Jury
in Boston indicted Sacco for the sale of narcotic drugs and
two days later he was released on bail. While awaiting trial
in the narcotics case, in Federal Court, Sacco was arrested and
indicted in Massachusetts State Court for grand larceny and

was released on bail on July 2, 1923.

In 1923, while he was on bail awaiting trial in the
narcotics and larceny cases, Filippo Sacco jumped bail in both
cases and disappeared from East Boston. The Government narcotics
informant, Fisher, disappeared about the same time and Government
sources believe that he may have been killed to prevent him from
testifying. Because of his fugitive status, both indictments
against Sacco were dropped. : :

After Sacco's flight from his home in 1923, he spent some
time in New York and Chicago, and finally made his appearance in ~
Los Angeles in 1924 under the fictitious name "John Roselli.”
Sources indicate that Sacco engaged in bootlegging and hijacking
during this period and police records show he was Ecequently
arrested.on such charges as carrying concealed weapons, and sus-
picion of robbery.

After 1930, Sacco became associated with the Al Capone
gang in Chicago and was also closely associated with organized
crime in Los Angeles. Reliable sources relate that he was an
executioner. for the criminal organizations in both cities. In
1936, by demands and threats, Sacco forced his way into part
ownership of "Nationwide News Service," a horseracing information
service used by bookmakers across the country.

. After ee was repealed, Sacco left the bootlegging _
business and associated himself with Columbia Picture Studios.
As a close friend of Los Angeles underworld leader Jack Dragna,
Sacco soon became known as a labor muscleman and racketeer for
the movie studios. In 1943, Sacco was indicted on a charge of
conspiracy to extort millions of dollars from movie producers
and a labor union, Also indicted were union cfficials Browne
and Bioff, and the following ranking members of the Chicago La
Cosa Nostra family: Frank Nitto (aka Nitti), Louis Campagna, |
Paul DeLucia (aka Paul "the waiter" Ricia), Phil D'Andrea,

Francis Manitote (aka Frank Diamond), and Charles "Cherry Nose”

Gioe. In 1944, Sacco and the Chicago defendants were convicted
and all were sentenced to ten years in prison.

In 1947, Sacco and all his co-defendants were paroled
immediately upon their becoming eligible therefor. There were
indications that their release had been secured by bribery but
admissible evidence sufficient for prosecution was not obtained.

In July 1948, Sacco's parole was revoked because of his con-

tinued association with known criminals and he was imprisoned

oe BAH PF WN

until November 1948, when his parole was reinstated. Shortly

Ss

after Sacco's parole terminated in March 1954, William Bioff, a

key Government witness at the extortion trial was murdered by ~
12 the bombing of his vehicle. (The trial judge reportedly had |
13) warned the defendants that if anything happened to Bioff while
14 they were on parole he would hold them responsible.) Two other H
5 co-defendants of Sacco have also been victims of gang slayings.

16 Upon his release from prison, Sacco returned to Los Angeles
7 and again associated himself with a movie studio. Reliable i
18 sourees report that this was a front and in fact, through his i

19 close association with Sam Giancana of Chicago, Sacco received

20 | the responsibility of overseeing the concealed interests. in \
21 Las Vegas casinos of the Chicago underworld. Sacco immediately

i
22 became a powerful figure in Las Vegas. He travels back and
23 forth between Las Vegas and Los Angeles extensively and asso-
Ed eiates with the known Cosa Nostra members and major gamblers. i
cS Rosselli appeared before the Kefauver Committee investi- i
26 | gating organized erime and falsely testified concerning his
ey association with underworld figures and even his own personal i
za background. :
29 During the period 1956-1958, Sacco was very active in !

Nevada Gaming Control Board refused to allow the Tropicana to
open as long as Sacco was associated with its operation, where-
upon the hotel owners were forced to buy back the gift shop lease
at a cost of $180,000, reportedly about thirty times the amount
paid for the lease.

During the above period, Sacco also involved himself in the
production of shows for the Tropicana, but again the Gaming
Control Board refused to allow him to participate in ‘any capacity ..
and he sold his interest. Following his ouster from the - ES. =
Tropicana, Sacco sold ice machines to most of the Las Vegas hotels =
at prices far in excess of prices on the open market. Sacco has
also received numerous "finders fees" from various Las Vegas
hotels and casinos for which few if any services were performed.

In October 1960, Sacco and T. W. Richardson were involved. --
in placing a wire tap on the telephone of comedian Dan Rowan in
Las Vegas at the request of Chicago gangster Sam Giancana..

In May 1968, Sacco was convicted of failing to register as
an alien and report his address annually. In the course of that
trial, it was shown that birth records in Chicage, Illinois, had -
béen forged in an effort to make it appear that Sacco had been
born there as John Rosselli. Sacco has long been a close friend
of Edward J, Barrett, County Clerk, Cook County, Illinois, in
whose office the birth records for Chicago were kept.

Among Sacco's underworld associates. are the following:

Al Capone - head of the Chicago underworld gang;

Charles F. Fischetti - a Capone lieutenant;

Micky Cohen - gambler and racketeer;

Jack Dragna - leader of the Cosa Nostra, Los Angeles,

now deceased; a

Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel - member of Murder, Inc., :

Allen Smiley - gambler, bookmaker, racketeer;
Tony Accardo - ranking Cosa Nostra figure;
Momo Adams - ranking Cosa Nostra figure; and

Frank Costello - ranking Cosa Nostra figure.

Numerous prospective witnesses in the course of investiga-
tions concerning Sacco's criminal activities have expressed or
displayed fear at the prospect of being called to testify
against him, and a number of witnesses have refused to testify.

In the Friars Club trial, it was apparent ‘that a number of
witnesses deliberately perjured themselves in order to exonerate
Sacco, including Friedman, Vinnie’ Donato, Lee Deer, and Nat Ross.

Defendant Sacco was convicted in the Friars Club case in
December 1968 of interstate travel in aid of a racketeering
enterprise and interstate transportation of fraudulently obtained

securities. He was also convicted of making a false statement in

his income tax return. Sacco has had a long practice of concealing.

the source and nature of his income. He was sentenced to five years|

in prison.

In view of Sacco's extensive criminal record extending back
more than’:40 yeara, as well as his membership and participation
in the organized criminal syndicate known as Cosa Nostra, we
strongly urge that defendant Sacco's sentence not be geduced for
any reason whatsoever, He is a genuine menace to society and, H

in particular, to those witnesses who have testified against him.

Subject: Interview of John Roselli
: : On We nesday February 20, 197%, Scott Armstrong, Mare Lackritz
7 Muse interviewed John Roselli at the office of Roselli's attorney, Tom Wadden, ©
°° 888 17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C., telephone 833-1440. Also present
Wadden's associates Bryan B. McMenamin and Leslie Scherr. Hieitens _

_ Wadden began the interview by noting that for. the first time, he had
discussed with Roselli the Maheu Cuban matter with which we vere concerned; and
found that it presented a great problem of national security. Accordingly he had
tried to reach Senator Ervin, an old acquaintance, and see if he could persuade the
Senator from allowing this interview to go forward. He did not get in touch with
Ervin directly but talked to a staff member in Ervin's office, whom he would not .
identify. He further’ noted that, Roselli was insistent upon not giving any informatior
about his Cuban activities and would rather go to jail than be compelled to testify
about the matter. Thus the interview was’ not’productive insofar,as Roselli's
_involvement with Mahey in 3960 "was, concerned. However Wadden did allow us to inter-
view Roselli aboat his background and we reserved the right to an executive: =
* session before a Senator where John Roselli might be compelled to testify about his ©
involvement, with Maheu in Cuba., (It should be noted that Wadden would not identify
his privilege claim other than saying it related to nati : )

wisn? ie nee * cenit s.r -
“John Roselli presently, resides with his ‘Sister and ‘brother-in-law, a Mr.
and Mrs. Joseph Daigle at 522 Southwest Temp, Corner,, Plantation, Florida 33314. His
telephone number there is area.305 581-6585. He has been living in retirement with
them since he left jail at the end of last sumer. Prior to moving to Florida he
had been in the federal prison for thirty-three months, having been convicted in the
Friar's Club case, a conspiracy in which he was charged along with Maurice Friedman,
Benjamin Teitlebaum, and Mamel Jacobs. (He noted that Hank Greenspun had no involve-
ment either as a co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator in that case.)

* With regard Bob Maheu, he met Maheu for, the first time in the mid-50's
in either Washington or, California through a mutual acquaintance, Herman Spitzel.
When questions were asked as to what his subsequent involvement with Maheu was,
Roselli's attorney instructed him not to answer any questions the ground of
national security." _~ cela fe Git ‘ F

Roselli did however: indicate how he and Mahev had made arrangements for
Hughes to live at the Desert Inn when Hughes first arrived there in late 1966. He
said that he had received & call from Maheu, who needed to make arrangements for
Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston. According to Maheu, no one wanted to give
Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles
and went up to Las Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who owned 134 of
the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the penthouses:
at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for
seeing that Hughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas. Kolod acquiesced and told
Roselli that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be available at the going rate,
but that they would have to leave the hotel by, New Years. When the New Years date
was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had. received notice from Kolod and
“were suppose to leave their premises. Roselli then convinced Kolod to allo chem
to stay. At the same time he ‘told Maheu that Hughes should buy the Hotels 2
ems ¢ the impression that, Bughes didi



want to get involved in any of the gambling businesses and would not therefore want
to purchase the hotel. It was at this point that Roselli conceived of the idea of.
trying to sell the hotel, and approached Kolod and asked if he would be willing to
sell it. Kolod replied that if Roselli could make arrangements to sell it he would
receive a finder's fee. Roselli then turned around and-asked Maheu if he wanted to
purchase it. Maheu responded that he would and Roselli-turned the matter over to
his attorney Fd Morgam who then handled the matter until the end. Roselli also
instigated some talk about the possibility of purchasing the Sands and, while he did
not negotiate it, received at a later date from "d Morgan a check for $95,000 which .
represented his finder's fee for the sale of both the Desert Inn and the Sands.

Roselli noted that while Moe Dalitz was the owner of the Desert Inn, he -
did not negotiate with him because he found him less agreeable than Kolod. He said
that he had some minor dealings with Dalitz but none of them related to matters
concerning the Las Vegas hotel industry. ; Be =
With regard to Ed Morgan, Roselli met him in the middle 50's. Since that
time Morgan has represented him in different Las Vegas interests. He noted that
Morgan did not represent him in his Friars! Club defense(but—did_arrange—for—Jdim
t Cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney handld’ the matter). He said that he had no
j trouble with Morgan's handling of the Desert Inn finder's fee, since he trusted
; Morgan implicity. He noted that Morgan had arranged for John Roselli to be represent
‘by Tom Wadden, his present attorney. This representation first began on the eppeal
from the Friar's Club. : : ‘

Roselli indicated'that his only present interest in Las Vegas concerns
his holdings in the gift shop at the Frontier hotel. His involvement there started
in 1967 when he had an arrangement with Mr. Friedman. ‘This set-up did not work out
and Roselli resigned as President of the gift shop. Thereafter he made an arrange-
ment with a Mr. Breen whereby he would furnish Breen with money and indemnify him
4 against any losses if Breen would run the gift shop. This arrangement has worked
+ out fairly well and he continues to receive his share of the profits each year from
7 the gift shop. He mentioned that it was his opinion that Breen had been poorly

treated by the Hughes enterprises, since Hughes first purchased the Frontier. He
: recalls, at his last meeting with Maheu, asking Maheu to lend Breen $60,000 for the
$ gift shop. Maheu'said he would get back to him but never did. Ultimately a loan
was arranged through Perry Thomas at. the Valley Bank of Nevada.

Since 1967 Roselli has’ seen Maheu only once, And while he does not recall
the date of that meeting he remembers that it was in Los Angeles before Maheu had
terminated with Hughes. He recalls that Maheu was in Los Angeles at the time while
‘ his wife was having a foot operation, and that he called Roselli to have supper.
= Roselli has no recollection of the conversation that the two had at supper other
than that they discussed, as noted above, the possibility of arranging a loan for
Breen at the Frontier Hotel Gift Shop.

He said he has known Peter Maheu since the middle 1950's and that he went
to Peter's wedding reception. His only involvement with Peter occurred whenever |
: Robert Maheu wanted a message conveyed to Roselli. He recalls no exheoquent Sos tact
i discussions with Peter Maheu. = Ef
He indicated he knew nothing about Larry O'Brien, Tony Hatsis, or Jack
| Cleveland. Similarly,he has no recollection of ever having met Bebe Rebozo, and
knows of the person only through newspaper articles.

With regard to his appearance before the Frontier Hotel grand jury in

Ios Angeles, he remembers being represented by James Cantillon a Los Angeles attorney
He remembers that this grand Jury was convened sometime in the summer of 1970 and
that his appearance took place before he went to Jail, which was January 25, 1971.
He has no recollection of NPavid Nissen, the prosecutor,ever having made 4 comment
about Maheu; nor did he question Roselli about his recollection of his involvement
with Maheu in the Cuban undertaking. Roselli had very bad words about Nissen and
mentioned that Nissen had once filed with Judge Gray an unsigned and undated state-
ment discussing Roselli's background, which Roselli, and Wadden both said was very
inaccurate ‘ : . : z

while he wes in jail, the IRS interviewed him in los Angeles about the finder's

to Maheu, but, since it was so short, he does not recall what the discussion
about Maheu concerned. He noted that no one has ever asked him about Danner,

With regard to Hank Greenspun, Roselli has known him since the 50's.
The last time he met Greenspun was when he ran into Greenspun in Ios Angeles shortly
after he got out of prison, at which time they talked a few mimites. No questions
were asked and there was no discussion with Greenspun about his involvement with
Maheu. He noted that Greenspun has never questioned him about any matters.

i He noted that he has never met Gordon Liddy, Howard Hunt or any of the
j Cuban Americans who wére involved in the Watergate break-in. He said however that
he has been Liddy once, and that was at Terminal Island when he was acting as a
prison librarian. There were no discussions with Liddy. He is fairly certain he
has never met Hunt with regard to any CIA involvement of his own. He also noted
that he has never had any property or business dealings in Cuba. ee
The interview concluded with the serving of a subpoena upon Mr. Roselli
and the decision to hold a further meeting under oath at a later date.

to Maheu, but, since it wag so short, he does not recall what the discussion
“about Maheu concerned. He noted that no one has ever asked him about Danner,
Rebozo or any members of the Administration, : be


With regard to Hank Greenspun, Roselli has known him since the 50's.
The last time he met Greenspun was when he ran into Greenspun in los Angeles shortly
after he got out of prison, at which time they talked a few minutes. No questions
were asked and there was no discussion with Greenspun about his involvement with
Maheu. He noted that Greenspun has never questioned him about any matters.

He noted that he has never met Gordon Liddy, Howard Hunt or any of the
Cuban Americans who wére involved in the Watergate break-in. He said however that
he has been Liddy once, and that was at Terminal Island when he was acting as a
prison librarian. There were no discussions with Liddy. He is fairly certain he -
has never met Hunt with regard to any CIA involvement of his own. He’ also noted
that he has never had any property or business dealings in Cuba. -

The interview concluded with the serving of a subpoena upon Mr. Roselli
and the decision to hold a further meeting under oath at a later date.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA )

LESLIE WHITTEN, being duly sworn, deposes and says the

following:

1. I am employed as principal associate of nationally-
syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, writer of.."Washington Merry~
Go-Round". ane

2. I worked on certain articles relating to John
Rosselli, and services performed by him on behalf of the Central
Intelligence Agency, an organ of the United States Federal Gov-
ernment.

3. As part of my investigation, I twice called William
K. Harvey, a retired Central Intelligence Agency official, now of
Indianapolis.

4. On my first call, in January, I asked Harvey if it
were not true that he had personally intervened with the Justice
.Department in order to mitigate the government's prosecution of
Rosselli on the basis that Rosselli had done a’formidable service
for his country. Harvey said "this is a long story . . . I don't
think it ought to be printed." I asked him whether it was not
true that he had a high regard for Rosselli. “I still do," he
earnestly replied.

5. In pursuing the story further, I called Harvey
again in Indianapolis in February and asked him whether he coulda |

comment on our story about Rosselli which by now has been pub-

lished widely in the United States. He declined to comment. But

he twice reaffirméd his “high regard" for Rosselli. I advised
him I was making an affidavit on Rosselli's behalf and he ex-
pressed concern for Rosselli, asked his present status and said
he would "follow up" on Rosselli's behalf from his end.

6. Based on my part of the investigation, I am satis-
fied that the facts set down in Exhibit A, appended to the Affi-
davit of Jack Anderson, are a truthful account of Rosselli's

activities on behalf of the United States.

June 24, ore Testimony of John Rosselli before Committee
Senator \Church presiding :

Los Angeles

Rosselli first met Maheu in approximately July, 1960,

pursuant to a telephone call from Maheu. At their first
meeting, Maheu told Rosselli that a high government official
had-requested that Maheu recruit Rosselli to "fight Communism
90 miles away from Florida" -- to recruit Cubans to assassinate
Castro.

New York

Rosselli had second meeting with Maheu and went to New York
in September under the alias of John Rawlston [Castro was
in New York at this time]. Rosselli met Jim O'Connell of
CIA, plus "three others."

Florida

O'Connell, Maheu and Rosselli met in Florida hotel approxi-
mately one week after New York. Rosselli introduced Giancana
to Maheu. Also introduced X (Trafficante) to Maheu. Obtained
permission from Maheu to bring Giancanainto project.

Rosselli recruits Cuban #1, Rosselli's cover was as Wall Street
businessman. Rosselli and Maheu agree on a $250,000 price tag
for the job.

O'Connell never met Cubans. Trafficante, Cubans and Maheu met.
Maheu brought $10,000 and poison capsules.

Rosselli told Giancana about CIA involvement to keep his mouth
shut. Rosselli only had one discussion with Giancana.

O'Connell called Rosselli after Bay of Pigs. Met in Florida

not long after Bay of Pigs with William Harvey, O'Connell and
Rosselli, Harvey told Rosselli that he wanted Rosselli to

have nothing to do with Maheu and not to use Giancana connections.

Rosselli indicates that pro-Castro people in Florida probably
had inkling of assassination attempts.

During Missle Crisis, Harvey asked Rosselli to see if "they"
had any intelligence on us, on the missiles.

FBI agents Hill and Dodge met with Rosselli and his lawyer,
Cantillon, At this time Dodge informed Rosselli that the

FBI was aware that he was not a U.S. citizen. Dodge indicated
something about Nevada and some other secret organizations.

Rosselli met with Sheffield Edwards in 1966 for some drinks
and discussed his problems with the FBI.

Rosselli received a telephone call from an FBI agent, Jack
Barron in June of 1970. The agent informed Rosselli that his
appeals can be reversed. He was told that his lawyers and
friends can't do anything for him in Washington.

Rosselli talked with Bill Harvey prior to his testimony before
the Select Committee to see if Harvey had objections and

Harvey only suggested that Rosselli protect those people whose
lives and whose families might be jeopardized by his testimony.

Rosselli stated he did not know the five so-called Watergate
burglars -- Hunt, McCord, Barker, Martinez or Sturgis.

Roselli had no doubt that the Cuban operation was on behalf
of the CIA and not Mr. Hughes.

Rosselli stated that his Cuban contacts were never informed
that this was a CIA project, but that he represented a Wall
Street business:

In the period 1967-1968, Rosselli failed to register as an
alien and faced criminal charges. :

Rosselli describes how he is brought into the operation --
Maheu's contact: and O'Connell's satisfying him that they
were government representatives.

Rosselli stated that Sheffield Edwards was not overly concerned
with the FBI's contacting Rosselli.

Rossell's reason for not informing his sources that it was
a CIA operation was because he believed he would be more
successful doing what he was doing by representing big
business.

When the FBI contacted Rosselli in both 1966 and 1970
they hinted that they wanted Rosselli to provide information
about United States gambling interests.

After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the whole operation came
to a halt and Rosselli said he was never in contact with
the Cubans again.

Rosselli met Harvey at Dulles Airport in Washington after
the Missile Crisis, in June 1963, and had dinner with him
in Washington that night.

Rosselli mentions FBI had him under surveillance for several
years.

Roselli has two stories re Rowan wiretap from Maheu. Maheu
told him he wanted Rosselli to get some bail money for two
guys in Las Vegas who were in trouble and he had placed some
taps in Rowan's room because 1) Maheu was doing Giancana a
favor, and 2) Maheu had the authority to see if Giancana was
leaking to his girlfriend.

Rosselli arranged bail money for the two men who were caught
tapping Rowan's room.

Giancana laughed when Rosselli discussed tapping incident with
him, but gave no-clues to the reason for the tap.

Rosselli:met in New York with O'Connell and Harvey in April
1962.

Rosselli states to the Committee that he felt the CIA came
to him because he has contacts in Cuba.

Rosselli states he took on "project" because it was the
government; he was patriotic.

Rosselli knew Trafficante before "operation" started.

Rosselli maintained some contact with Maheu after Harvey took
over.

Rosselli still is social friends with Harvey.
In April or May of 1966, Rosselli was stopped in the street

by two FBI agents with note saying to meet him later. Rosselli
referred them to his attorney, Mr. Cantillon

‘

Howard--

In re your "battle plan" memo. to Hart
and Garn, I think you should consider possible
wis bm of our Committee making some kind of
very low-key anouncement that we're doing
something. Purpose would be two-fold--to
prevent getting wholly co-opted by new
House Committee (and agencies making a
claim that since House is doing it, they can
ignore us~ -also to put House on notice there
is specific area we have carved and will
continue to carve out for ourselves). Most
important, we must do something affirmative to
insure that the sources out there come to us.
If we say nothing, potentials which just go
to House.under assumption that that's the onl
thing going on.

Attached is the type of low-key someone
could say/ in response to an inquiry (which
I assume Spencer gets lots of).

00 ONSEN YEON IESE SP I 8 RE IT OnE

My Turn

Kennedy and th

onspiracy theories are fashionable,
sometimes even fruitful, as in the
case of Watergate. So it is not surprising
that recent revelations of the Senate In-
telligence Committee have resurrected
an old question: what connection, ifany,
did the Castro government have with the
assassination of John F. Kennedy?
Current speculation is that the Cuban
dictator, having leamed of CIA plots
against his life, decided to strike back,
returning violence for violence, with
consequences that are now history. In-
deed, the recent report of the Schweiker-
Hart task force, while finding no hard
evidence to support this theory, did un-
cover some interesting new leads. More
than that, it established that a CIA-FBI
“cover-up” had deprived the Warren
sion of vital information that pre-
d it from. seriously exploring the
possibility of Castro's involvement and
that consequerity~ there is no longerany

reason to have faith in its picture of the _

Kennedy assassination.
so we may well have a reopening
ygestigation. At last.

‘all this, it seems appropriate to
examine the record of the period. A small
but interesting body of published testi-
inony and reminiscences describes and
amply documents a little-known cam-
paign of accommodation launched by
Washington and Havana in the weeks
preceding that fateful day in November
1063, Actually, the origins of this tenta-
tive and ultimately ill-fated rapproche-
t may be traced to the previous
spring. when. Castro, increasingly de-
pendent on his Soviet sponsors, found
himself obliged to embrace the banner of
“peaccful coexistence” in order to obtain
economic and military agreements need-
cd to assure the continued development
of his revolution. In practical terms, this
meant the normalization. of relations
with the United States.

A MESSAGE FOR CASTRO

It was not until September 1963, how-
ever, that this campaign began to show
results. At that time, William Attwood, an
adviser to the U.S. delegation to the
United Nations, told his superiors he had
word that Castro wanted an accommoda-
tion. John Kennedy got the message and
approved a “discreet contact” with the
Cuban U.N. representative, Carlos Le-
chuga. Subsequently, communications
we lished and meetings held

1

1
|

to discuss the prospect of negotiations.
By early November, Kennedy had de-
cided 'to push toward an opening with
Cuba in hopes of taking Castro out of the
Soviet fold and erasing the memory of
the Bay of Pigs. The Americans sought a
meeting to draw up an agenda for later
discussions. On Nov. 18, this message
was transmitted to Havana. Shortly
thereafter, Lechuga was instructed to set
forth such a plan for U.S. consideration.
Even as these developments were un-
folding, a second dialogue was taking
place through an unofficial envoy—the
French journalist Jean Daniel. On Oct.
24, Kennedy had received Daniel in the
White House. The President, it seems,
had leamed of the Frenchman's forth-
coming visit to Cuba and had decided to
seize the occasion to send Castro a mes-
sage. The essence of this communication
was a strong hint that the United States
would be willing to normalize relations
providing certain conditions were met.
What were those conditions? One, clear-
ly, was an end to Castroite subversion.
The U.S. had a special responsibility to
contain Communist expansionism. As
long as Havana continued to export revo-
lution, the economic “blockade” of the
island-would remain in effect.

ACCOMMODATIONS

Beyond this, not much was definite.
The American negotiating position had
not yet been worked out. Even so, hints
of possible Cuban participation in the
Alliance for Progress and of the desire of
the United States to see a decline in
Soviet influence on the island suggested
further avenues for discussion.

Bearing this message and an invi
to revisit the White House upon his re-
turn, Daniel set off for Cuba. There he
found a remarkably receptive Fidel Cas-
tro. Indeed, during the course of a six-
hour interview the I{der mdximo found
occasion to praise the American Presi-
dent for his sincerity, realism and “good
ideas”: Kennedy might yet understand
that there could be “coexistence be-
tween capitalists and socialists, even in
the Americas.” Castro was convinced
that normal relations could be restored
“on the basis of mutual respect for sover-
eignty.” His country needed peace in
order to concentrate on the socio-eco-
nomic tasks of the revolution. The issue
of subversion would not be an obstacle
Cubans would naturally “feel solidarity”

Donald E. Schulz

e Cuban Connection

with their revolu-
tionary brethren in
other lands. But ul-
timately, each na-
tion would have to
determine its own
destiny, and “ifthey
choose regimes oth-
er than ours, this is not our business.”

This was two days prior to President
Kennedy's death.

1. mentian these developments be-
cause they provide an important—and
perhaps crucial. of reference for
Congressional investigators and the pub-
lic alike: They are not, of course, proof of
innocence. But they are suggestive:
would Castro have been so intent on
coming to terms with a man he was
conspiring to kill? One may seriously
doubt it. In point of fact, the assassina-
tion would bring a quick end to Washing-
ton’s interest in accommodation.

POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

Still, this is not to rule out the possibil-
ity of a “Cuban connection.” Govern-
ments often behave in inconsistent and
self-defeating ways. Indeed, even as the
Kennedy Administration was taking
these first covert steps toward rap-
prochement, the CIA was engaged in an
attempt on Castro’s life. If, due to a lack
of political control and a prevailing at-
mosphere of cold-war hostility, U.S
agents could be conducting such activi-
ties in direct conflict with Presidential
policy, it is not difficult to imagine simi-
lar distortions on the Cuban side. Only a
few weeks earlier, Castro had publicly
denounced U.S.-sponsored assassina-

tions and even threatened retaliation.

Might not some overzealous security of-
ficials have taken this for tacit authority
to set up a “program of elimination”?

But all this remains speculation, It is
possible to envision any number of sce-
narios that might have Icd to. the fatal
events of Nov. 22. In lieu of hard evi-
dence, however, it seems only fair to give
Castro the same benefit of the doubt that
Kennedy has been accorded—namely,
that he be considered innocent until
proved guilty. It is hoped that the inves-
tigations to come will proceed on the
basis of that assumption.

Schulz, a Ph.D. candidate in political
science at Ohio State University, is writ-
ing a book on the Cuban revolution.

PART. TH

JIM. BRADER

One of the most incredible bodies of recent information
concerning the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President
Kennedy is largely based on the investigative research

done by Peter Noyes, a former CBS Producer and top inves- |.
tigative reporter.

Last year, Noyes published a. book, Legacy of Doubt, which

summed up many of his findings, and which generally outlines

what Noyes believes was heavy Mafia involvement in the
assassination. The Noyes book is almost entirely factual

and is largely based on substantiated information such as :
police records provided by the FBI, the Los Angeles Police
Department, the California Attorney General's Office, and

Texas police officials.

Though the Noyes book (like most recent assassination books)
@id not sell well or receive much press attention, it has
been regarded as a valuable contribution by most of author
Noyes' fellow Warren Commission critics.

It can definitely be said that almost all of Noyes' findings,
particularly with respect to his main character Jim Braden,
have been factually substantiated and are solidly established
by official police records.

Basically the Noyes book outlines the background of a

mysterious man who was picked up by the police at the scene

of President Kennedy's assassination just minutes after the
shooting. The man was apprehended by a Dallas policeman who A
thought he was behaving suspiciously. The man, who identified
himself under the false name of Jim Braden, was released

shortly thereafter following brief questioning by the Dallas
Sheriff's Office.

Author Noyes uncovered the story of Jim Braden and his
true identity during five years of investigative research.

And it is Jim Braden's true identity and his ironic misfortune

of being picked up at the scene of the assassination for

"looking suspicious" that the Warren Commission critics now

believe ranks with James McCord! $ mistake of leaving masking

tape on the doors during the Watergate break-in as the ultimate
. fatal slip-ups in the two conspiracies.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 376


For Jim Braden, whose true identity is Eugene Hale Brading,
is a man with singularly awesome direct ties to the highest
levels of the Mafia. Of all the Mafia figures connected to
the syndicate's crucial security and enforcement activities
of coercion, maiming, intra-syndicate assassination and
outside murder contracting, Jim Braden appears to be an
indispensable link - or leader - of organized crime's

far flung network of “controlled violence" specialists

and professional hit men.

Braden's involvement with the Mafia's hiqhest echelon
"enforcers" has spanned the continent from coast to coast
and covers virtually every national crime syndicate juris-
diction. According to federal authorities working with the
Justice Department's organized crime strike force units, and
according to other high government sources cited by author
Noyes, Jim Braden is now serving as personal courier for
Neyer Lansky.

The importance of this mysterious man who was picked up
under a false name across the street from the Texas Book
Depository just moments after the shots were fired on
November 22, 1963 cannot be overemphasized.

Though there were several innocent witnesses or bystanders
in the area of the assassination who were also arrested or
brought in for questioning by the Dallas police, all of whom
were shortly released like Jim Braden, his presence there at
that precise moment does in fact raise an incredible specter,
and may indeed have been the monumental slip-up that critics
of the Warren Commission now attest to.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 377


Jin Braden's Arrest On Vovember 22

Deputy C.L. Lewis was one of the first Dallas police
officers on the scene at the Texas School Book Depository
following the assassination.

Within just minutes after the deadly shots were fired,
Deputy Lewis confronted a man across the street from the
Book Depository, a man whom Lewis thought was “acting
suspiciously."

Deputy Lewis questioned the man for several minutes before
taking him to the Sheriff's office for further interroaation.
The man identified himself as Jim Braden, and said that he
was in the oil business in Beverly Hills, California. Deputy
Lewis became even more suspicious over the way the man first
tried to identify himself. Instead of producing his driver's
license, the common means of identification, the man pulled
out a gasoline credit card instead.

The man who identified himself as Jim Braden strongly protested
when Deputy Lewis told him that he would have to take him in
for further interrogation.

at the Sheriff's office, Jim Braden agreed to make a voluntary
statement. Braden, then 48, told the police that he was in
Dallas on oil business and had been there for two days. He
said he was staying at the Cabana Motel, s short distance away
from the scene of the assassination. Braden said’he had been
walking down the street by the Texas Book Depository at the
time of the assassination and had been looking for a taxi cab.
Jin Braden further stated that he was confronted by Deputy
Lewis inside a building across the street from the Depository
during an attempt to make a telephone call following the
shooting.

Braden was shortly thereafter released by the Dallas Sheriff's ~*
office, Braden was not fingerprinted, nor was any check made
I of possible criminal records relating to him.

Two months later, in late January cf 1964, Jim Braden was
interviewed hy. two FBI agents at his office in Beverly Hills,
The Warren Commission's investigation was then in full swing
and witnesses to the assassination were being questioned by
the FRI and other authorities, In his FBI interview, Braden
gave the same account as he had given to the Dallas police on
the day of the assassination. The FBI's official report on
Braden's interrogation further stated that, "Braden has no
information concerning the assassination and both Lee Harvey
Oswald and Jack Ruby are unknown to hin."

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 378


Jim Draden's True Identity Energes

In early 1969, Peter Noves, the investigative reporter
whose book covers much of the information regarding Jim
Braden, began investigating the mysterious California
"oil man."

Noyes oriqinally received a tip about Braden from a

former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney

Jim Garrison's investigation of the Kennedy assassination,
The FBI man told Noves of Braden's presence at the scene of
the assassination at the time of the shooting.

Noyes soon found that Jim Braden was no longer at either
of the addresses that he had given the Dallas police, and
had left no forwarding addresses, :

Noyes then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles
run a check on the license number that Braden had given to
the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the
assassination. Notor Vehicles told Noyes that Braden's
license (1751755) had been reneved by Braden in San Diego
county in Hovember of 1966. Braden has also listed’ new
business and home addresses, which interestingly were over
a hundred miles apart.

The Department of Motor Vehicles' records on Jim Braden
also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really’ his original
name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's
to Eugene Male Drading, which is Braden's true identity.

On September 10, 1963, just ten weeks before the assassination,
Nugene tale-Brading had notified the Department that he had
legally changed his name to Jim Braden, and he requested a

new license under that name. The license was granted.

Intrigued by the fact that Jim Braden was really a false
identity assumed by “ugene Brading, investigator Noyes
contacted the Intelligence Division of. the California
Attorney General's Office, and had a check run on the
mysterious Brading.

oves was told that Eugene Hale Brading "is a real bad guy.

e's got a long rap sheet and apparantly has Mafia connections."
Noyes shortly thereafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's
(Jim Braden's) police records.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 379


1
the Brading "rap sheet" contained an incredible 35
seperate entries covering virtually every phase of
criminal activity, including mail fraud, embezzlement,
operating a gambling house in Miami, car theft, shop
lifting, receiving stolen property, and selling wartime
gas ration coupons on the black market.

Host of these arrests had been made under the name of
Eugene Hale Brading, but the police dossier on him also
showed a handful of other aliases, including Harry fugene
Bradley, Gene Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,
and inevitably, Jim Braden.

"Jim Braden" was the last entry shown on Brading's
records.

Incredibly, investigator Noyes found that due to the fact
that the Dallas nolice had not fingerprinted Jim Braden or
run a make on him, his true identity of Eugene Brading was
never discovered by the FBI or the Varren Commission at the
time of their investigation of the assassination. The Warren
Commission had only routinely included Braden'ts short state=-
ment about being in Dallas on "oil business" in a police
exhibit on witnesses contained. in Warren Commission Hearing's
Volume XIX. Jim Braden and his story had been accepted at
face value.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 380


HW 50955

Jin Draden (Sucene Brading) And. The Uafia

Investigator Noyes began a thorough investigation of
Braden based upon all available police records and
documents.

What soon clearly emerged was a long record of involvement
by Braden (Brading) with many of the most notorious Mafia
leaders in the nation, a record of close association with --
key figures in the national crime syndicate,

Following a string of arrests in the 1940's, ‘dating all
the wav back to his young adulthood, Eugene Brading had
moved to El Paso, Texas, in 1950.

(BRADING ? PEREIRA)

In El Paso, Brading became closely associated with Victor

,
Pereira, a man who was a close associate and confidante of

several] Mafia members. Brading and Pereira becane involved
in a number of schemes involving marriage to and embezzlement
of wealthy widows,

In 1951, Bracing and his close friend Pereira were arrested
by the FRI in New York on a fugitive warrant issued in Texas,
The two men were charged with embezzling over $50,000 from

a wealthy widow whom Pereira had marricd shortly before
flecing with her money. Brading and Pereira were soon con-
victed of the charges and were each sentenced to 12 years

in prison.

liowever, PBrading and Pereira were out free during the three
years of their appeals, and Brading was later paroled in 1959
after having served just five years of nis sentence.

(BRADING AHD THE SMALDOLES)

During the three vears of freedom under thoir appeals of the
convictions, Brading and Pereira left Texas (following still
another fleecing of another wealthy widow) and moved to
Denvor, Colorado,

In Denv Brading became very closely associated with
tuo leading Mafia bosses in the Rocky Mountain area, Clyde
and Gene Smaldone.

DocId:32423630 Page 381


tthe Snmaldone brothers, who vere also known as “Checkers
and Flin Flon," were. the Mafia leaders in charge of the
syndicate's vending-machine market which stretched from
the Rockies all the way to Chicago. Police records show
that at one time, the Smaldones virtually controlled the
entire Pueblo area of Colorado.

The Smaldone brothers were notorious for the brutal brand

of violence they practiced in their operations. Brading
(Braden) became involved in many transactions with the
Gmaldones and became a close personal friend. Several years
later, after Brading finally went to jail for the embezzlement
of the Texas widow, the Smaldone brothers reqularly wrote

to him in prison, seeking his advice on various financial
matters,

(BRADING AKD CLARK AUD BAUIMAII)

Brading and his friend Pereira later moved to Beverly Hills
in California. Shortly thereafter, Brading inevitably came
under investiagation by the Los Angeles Police Department
Intelligence Division's Mafia specialists.

In particular, the LAPD interest in Brading was focused on
his close association in Beverly Hills with two "oil specu-
lators" from Niami, Arthur Clark and Roger Bauman. Clark
and Bauman were notorious Mafia figures with. long police
records.

Brading's friend Clark had been one of the ton leaders of
the famous Purple Gang of the Mafia, which had onerated
out of Detroit and Youngstown. The Los Anccles police had
nlaced Clark and Bauman under tight surveillance and had
compiled extensive information on their friendship with
Brading.

In 1956, the Chief of Intelligence of the LAPD, Captain
James Hamilton, sent a letter to the Crime Commission of
Greater Miami seeking information about Clark, Bauman, and
Brading.

Captain Namilton, who was known as one of the foremost

experts on the Hafia in the nation, asked the Niami Commission
(which was conducting extensive investigations of the Mafia)
to inform him as to the involvement of several associates of
Clark and Bauman.

Among those named was Eugene Brading.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 382


a.

Captain Hamilton's letter stated:

i
"This Denpartmenti has under investigation Arthur
Lewis Clark, Sr., FBI 3709258, and a Roger Bauman.
These men are representing themselves as officials
of the Sunbeam 031 Company, 212 Roosevelt Theater
Building, Miami Beach, and both are spending money
very lavishly."

"Clark has been arrested several times and has been
associated with many confidence men and hoodlums such
as James Fratianno, Victor Pereira, Zuqene Brading,
Clarence Rhodes, Stephen Sambor and the Siraldone
brothers of Denver."

As investigator Peter iioves points out, the men listed
with Brading in the letter, represent a virtual “Who's Who"
of organized crime leaders between California and the Midwest,

(BRADING AUD FRATIANNO)

Of these top liafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhans
the most important one is James Fratianno, also widely known
as “Jimmie The Weasel," Fratianno was known as perhaps the
Hafia's highest ranking executioner in the nation.

In 1959, in his testimony before the Rackets Committee of
the California legislature, Captain Hamilton, the Chief of
LAPD Intelligence, stated that,

"We have.lond considered Fratianno to
be the exccutioner for the Nafia on
the West Coast."

Captain Hamilton told the Rackets Committee that his Intelligence
Division had linked Jimmie Fratianno to at least sixteen Mafia
executions.

Fratianno had once been arrested for the attempted assassination
of Los Angeles Mafia head Nickey Cohen in 1949, Cohen had
survived the bloody shooting which took the life, of one of

his lieutenants, Fratianno. was later released due to insuf-
ficient evidence. Fratianno used the alibi that he had been

at the home of Mafia associate Nick Licata the night of the
shooting. Licata-later became the new head of the Los Angoles
Mafia, and, perhaps significantly, was later given control of
the Mafia in Dallas, Texas.

NW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 383


©

Jimmie Fratianno was also susnected of complicity in
the murders of two men in 1951. Two men who made the
mistake of robbing the MNafia's Flamingo Hotel in Las
Vegas were found dead’in a parked car following the
robbery. Both of their skulls had been shattered by
bullets fired behind the ear, apparantly in true Mafia
fashion.

Fratianno had also been linked to the famous murder of
arry “Hooky" Rothman, who had been another close
associate of Nickey Cohen, the Los Angeles Mafia head.
Also, Fratianno was also linked to the disappearance of
another top member of the Mickey Cohen gang, Frank Hiccoli.
Niccoli had mysteriously vanished following a late dinner
at Fratianno's home one night.

Fratianno was also linked to the brutal murder of a business-
man in northern California in 1952, Thomas Keen, a wealthy

that he owed the Mafia, and was blown to bits from a dynamite
charge hidden under the hood of his car.

Fratianno later served a six year prison term (1954-1960) for
extortion. In later years Fratianno became the central fiqure
involved in LOOK magazine's “expose" of San Francisco HKayor
Joseph Alioto's alleged Mafia connections. LOOK alleged that
Fratianno had become a close friend of Mayor Alito and that

the Mayor had arranged for Fratianno to receive loans of over
$105,000 from a bank where Alioto served as Chairman of the
Board, Alioto admitted that Fratianno was a “casual acquaintance"
of his, but denicd that’ he had used anv influence in the loans.
The Nayor also said that he had not known that the notorious
Fratianno was a member of the Hafia.

BRADING AND MELTZER)

while in Los Angeles, Brading (Jin Braden) also became
connected with top Mafia leader Harold “lianny" Heltzer.
fhe LAPD Intelligence Division had originally become

aware of Brading's close relationship with leltzer when
Brading's name was found on Neltzer's Christmas card list.
Meltzer was widely known as one of the most powerful Nafi
leaders in the entire nation.

The U.S. Senate Rackets Committee identified Brading's
friend Meltzer as a top Nafia boss in the areas of union
racketeering and narcotics.

A renort of the Senate Rackets Committee from 1964 state

"Meltzer now is reported to operate a large

bookmaking and prostitution syndicate in

California, A major figure in the organized
underworld, he is known to all. the important

narcotics traffickers throughout the United

States. He has also overated in Oklahoma,

Tenas, Baltimore, Hiami, Las Vegas, Boston, i
and various areas of Canada, Cuba, liong Kong, :

ADINWG AiD THE SICAS)

In Los Anceles, Brading also became closely associated with
yet another top Nafia operation, Bracing became a close
friend and associate of the notorious Sica brothers - Joe,
Freddie, and George. The Sica brothers were particularly
brutal syndicate members specializing in narcotics.

In 1950, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles accused Brading's
friends, Joe and Freddie Sica, of heading the single largest
narcotics ring in the United States.

The Sica brothers were shortly thereafter brought to trial.

On the night before the trial onened, the government's

star witness, an informant named Abe Davidian, was mysteriously
shot to death in his mother's home in Fresno. The nurder was
never solved and the Sica brothers were soon released for

lack of evidence.

Jim Braden: Possible Link To Jack Buby

The same inadequate investigative work which led the
Warren Commission to largely overlook Jack Ruby's solid
Mafia involvement, apnears also to have been responsible
for the failure to uncover Jim Braden's true identity of
Eugene Brading during the official investigation into the
Kennedy assassination. .

As shown in the previous account of Jack Ruby's very
substantial ties to the Mafia, Ruby was particularly
involved in the syndicate areas of gambling and narcotics.

But beyond the multiplicity. of evidence which indicates
that Jack Ruby and Jim Braden were both important Nafia
figures operating in the same general areas, at the same
general times, there is another single piece of evidence
which places both Ruby and Braden at the same place on the
day before the assassination.

Evidence indicates that both Jim Braden and Jack Ruby
visited the Dallas offices of the M.L. Hunt Oil Company
on © afternoon of Hovember 21, 1963, just twenty four
hours before the President was murdered. Obviously any
link which places both Braden and Ruby in the same place
at the same time on the day before the assassination does
of course raise further significant questions about a
possible relationship between the two men.

S

Jim Praden receiv permission from the U.S.
Parole in Los Angeles to make a trip to Pallas,

verbor 19, 1963, four days before the assassination.
Braden was required to report all of his travels to his
Parole Roard following his parole .in 1959 for the enbez=
zlement conviction.

On November 21, 1963, the day before the assassination,
Jim Braden checked in with the U.S. Parole Office in
Dallas. Accordina to Roger Carroll, the Chief Parole
officer in Dallas, Draden (Brading) “advised that he
planned to sce Lamar Hunt and other oil speculators while

here." Lamar Munt is the son of H.L. Hunt, the famous
right-wing oil billionaire.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 386


12.

Yaul Rotherme], a former FBL agent who was Director of
Security for the Tiunt Oil Comnany in Dallas at that. time,
has’ recalled that he distinctly remembers Braden visiting
the Hunt offices on Kovember 21 in the company of three
other men. Rothermel has stated that the office log for
Movember 21 showed that Roger Bauman (Bradinq's old Mafia
friend) and rqan Brown and Duane Nowlin "and friend"
visited the lunt office on that afternoon. Rothermel states
hat Braden was definitely the "friend."

(Security chief Paul Rothermel was later fired by H.L. Hunt's
sons after reports allegedly surfaced that Rothermel was
“suspicious" of a possible Hunt connection to the assassin-
ation. Following his termination by the Hunts, Rothermel
found that he was being illegally wiretapped. Rothermel

filed suit acainst Lamar Hunt and another one of H.L. Hunt's
sons, charging them with the wiretapnin and asking for
several million dollars in damages. The suit, which has
produced very damaging cvidence against the Hunt. brothers,

is still in the courts.)

Also on Movember 21, the day before the assassination,
according to a conclusion of the Warren Commission, Jack

Ruby was also on his way to the H Munt offices in Dallas,
The Warren Commission concluded that Jack Ruby drove a woman
friend of his to the tnt offices sometime that same after-
noon. The woman, who had declined work in Ruby's nightclub

as a stripper, drove with Ruby to the Hunt offices, apparantly
in search of employment. This does coincide with Braden's
visit to the same offices on that same afternoon.

The Yarren Commission ted several other possible
links of Jack Ruby to 7 , including the still
unexnlained fact that Lamar Hunt's name was found inside
one of Ruby's notebooks. But of these possible links, the
Warren Commission concluded only that evidence did indicate
that Ruby had driven to the Hunt offices on November 21.

Thus a possible Ruby-Braden connection on the day before
the President's assassination does indeed arise.

Jin Braden: fossible Link Yo David Ferric

Investigator Peter Noyes has turned up several pieces
of information which indicate a possible connection between
Jim Braden and the mysterious David Ferric.

David Ferrie w sual airline pilot and nrivate
investiaator whom Tim Ga ayetean accused of participating

in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Six days after
District Attorney Garrison's charges were made public, David
Ferrie was found dead in his apartment in New Orleans. His
mysterious death was finally ruled to have been a suicide.

David Ferrie has been a target of investigati v critics
of the Warren Commission ever since the assassination. In
fact the FBI and Secret Service both investiaated a possible

Ferrie role immediately after the assassination. It was

widely rumored in Orleans and Dallas that Ferrie was to

have flown the alleged assassins out of the country following
the assassination. The Varren Commission decided not to include
the official Secret Service, and FBI ranorts on Ferrie in the

26 Volumes of liearings which were, released after the Narren

was issued. However, the Justice Denartment did finally
those renorts to the National Archives in 1967 following

on's public accusations,

t Author Moyes has sinte Ce cen amas that both Jim Braden and

' Davod Ferrie worked out of thevyfloor of offices in a building
| in New Orleans in the month.or two immediately preceding the
assassination.

This is narticularly significant due to the fact that at that
time the mysterious David Ferrie was employed as a private
investicator by Carlos Ha reer the 1fia kingpin. It

s widely believed by most federal authorities that Carlos
arccllo ranks with his close friend tieyer Lans as one of
the tvo sinqle most powerful leaders of the Nafiats national
and international crime syndicate, Carlos Marcello heads the
Mafia cmpire centered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and controls
most of the Mafia activity in the southern part of the United
States.

In September and Octoher of 1963, just weeks before the
assassination, David Ferrie was working out of the offices

of Carlos Narcello's criminal attorney, G. Wray Gill. Ferrie,
who was doing investigative work on a nerjury charge that his
boss Marcello was then facing, worked out of Room 1707 in the
Pore liarguette Building in New Orleans.

At this same time, in September.and October of 1963, Jim
Braden was operating out of Room 1701 in the Pere Marquette

Building.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 388


Braden s then commuting between Yew Orleans and

Beverly fiills, with the approval of his Parole Board,
Braden was working as a representative of his Mafia
friend Roger Bauman, the oil speculator. Braden worked
out of Room 1701, which was the office of his associate,
Victor Hain, Jr., an oil geologist. This was just a short
way down the hall from David Ferrie. in Room 1707.

Interestingly, in one visit to his Parole Office, Braden
"nistakenly" told his Parole Officer that he. vas working
out of Room_170G - which would have been the room next -

door to Ferric - instead of Room 1701.

Thus a possible Braden-Ferrie connection in the weeks

just before the assassination does indeed arise in addition
to the nossible Braden-Ruby connection. Both connections
definitely do seem to fall outside of or beyond the area
which coulé reasonably be attributed to coincidence, chance,
or circumstance.

Pevond several sets of information which tend’ to indicate
that David Terrie had some contact with Lee Oswald at
various , the cxitics of the Narren Commission have
narticularly focused on Ferrie's ties to Carlos Marcello
and the Marcello Mafia empire.

In fact, in his interviews with the FBI and Secret Service
after the assassination, Ferrie claimed that he was with
Narcello at the very time of the assassination. Ferrie
stated that he was in court with Marcello on the afternoon
of November 22, which does anpear to be truc.

Carlos Harcello, along with Meyer Lansky, had become the
central targets of the Justice Denartment's Organized
Crime Division in the carly 1960's, under the vigorous
direction of Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

Marcello, known as "The Little lan," became one of Attorney
General Kannedv's most fierce enemies during that neriod.
Marcello once claimed he had been ki@nhapped under orders
of Robert Kennedy and Justice Department.

Ra’ Reid, a lt ¢ and widely recognized
as one of the most respected experts on the Nafia in the
nation, has written that Carlos Marcello once threatened to
have President Kennedy and his brother murdered, Reid has
written that he was told of Marcello's threat by an informant
who attended a secret meeting with Marcello in New Orleans in
September of 1962.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 389

Accordina to Reid's informant, Harcello told his top
lieutenants, "Don't worry about that little Bobby
sonofabitch. lie's qoing to be taken-care of." The
informant stated that Marcello said that President
Kennedy himse]f£ would have to be killed first, and
that his brother would then follow. he informant
further stated that Marcello spoke of using Some “nut"
to do the killings.

Jim Draden: Author Peter voves And Judae Byrne

Peter Noves, the investigative reporter who uncovered

most of the material regarding Jim Braden (isuger Brading),
is a former classmate and close friend of Judge Matthew
Byrne, Jr., the U.S. District.Court Judge who presided
over the £llsberq Pentagon Papers trial last year.

As is now well known, Judge Byrne dismissed the case
against Ellsberq after he was notified that the White
House "Plumbers" had once burglarized the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist,

A short time later, it became known that President Nixon

had twice instructed John Ehrlichman to anproach Judge

Byrne. during the course of the Ellsbera trial and offer him
the position of Director of the FSI. This offer, which Judge
Byrne refused, has been regarded as a potential act of
bribery by some critics of President tixon, and is currently
under investigation by the Svecial Frosecutor's Office.

It has been widely assumed that Nixon's fervent interest
in the outcome of the prosecution of Ellsbera may: have
been the motivation behind his approach to Judge Byrne.

Author Noyes has written of his friend Judge Byrne's
involvement in his research on Jim Braden. In 1969, after
Noyes had accumulated much of his information reqarding.

the mysterious Braden, he took the information to his
friend, Matt Pyrne, who was then U.S. Attorney for southern
California. Uoyes had several talks with Byrne and has said
that Byrne s very impressed by the substantive ovidence
thich Moyes had aath oad rd one of esq meetinas with
Byrne and another FBI man whom Byrne had invited to attend,
the FBI man told Noyes that the FBI had never before known
that Jim Braden - the man arrested at. the scene of the

ass nation in 1963 .=- was actually Yugene Erading. the
FBI man said that the Bureau must have made a big mistake
in not tracing down Braden's true identity and police record.
he FRI man was nearly incredulous over Hoves' evidence on
Braden,

Noyes meanwhile had discovered that Jim Braden had also been
in Los Angeles on the night that Robert Kennedy was assassinated
in early June of 1968.

Though Noyes couldn't find any significant information indicating
any Braden connection to the second Kennedy murder, he and his
friend Matt Byrne forwarded the information on Braden to the
Special Unit of the LAPD which was investigating the RFX death.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 391


The Special Unit of the LAPD, according to yes, dis-
counted the information reaarding the RPK assassination,
but was indeed impressed by the Braden connection to the
1963 assassination. Noyes writes that Judge Byrne never
heard anymore about it after he forwarded the information
to the RFX investigators.

Immediately following the assassination of President
Kennedy, Sugene Brading (Jim Braden) had an upturn in
his personal finances.

Brading later reported a large increase in revenue fron
an oil well he dan interest in back in Louisiana. He
reported the larqe increase in revenue from the well for
the month of November 1963.

®& month later, in December of 1963, Bradina became a
charter momber of the exclusive (and very expensive)

La Costa Country Club in southern California. Later that
year, 1964, Brading and his old syndicate oil friend
Roger Ba wn estanlished the "BR And B'Cattle Comnan
The comnany.was set up in Chicago and was vresumably

amec after then, "B And 5," though neither of the two

men are listed as corporate officers. It was also during
this same neriod that Brading made a substantial investment
in two lots in Coral Gables, Florida.

In 1965, Brading's lengthy parole was finally terminated.
Ne soon bougnt a new home near the La Costa Country Club
which he had joined, and he also bought a house for his

And it is at the La Costa Country Club that the mysterious

of its 100 Charter members in January of 1964, is one of
the more notorious Mafia properties in the nation.

The La Costa Country Club had become, under the direction
of Noe Dalitz and lievyer Lansky, a key “watering hole" of
the syndicate. La Costa was originally financed through a
syndicate deal with James Hoffa of the Teamsters. One of
the Teamsters Union's billion dollar Pension Funds was used

in the financing of the project. La Costa became what is

Known in the Hafia as “open territory" ~ meaning that no
single Mafia family controlled it. La Costa was open to all.

Intelligence authorities in southern California have long
regarded La Costa 2s a.nrime hangout for the Mafia. Some
officials have dubbed it "Apalachin West."

The syndicate had oricinally qiven Charter memberships in
La Costa to a number of Hollywood celebrities, so as to
soften the age of the plush resort. Among the members
were Frank Sinatra, Bob Iiope, and Bing Crosby.

embers of Prosident Nixon's inner circle also became
frequent guests as La Costa, which is just twenty miles
avay from San Clemente. Early in the Nixon Administration,
in 196°, Los Angeles Police were astonished to find Murray
Chotiner, one of the President's closest confidantes, living
it up at La Costa while the President was in San Clemente,

In February of 1973, while President Hixen was at’ San Clen-
ente, H.R. Haldeman, John .Ehrlichman, Richard Moore, and
John Dean held a series of meetings at La Costa to discuss
the Watergate conspiracy, which was then beginning to
unravel,

John Dean qave hatte testimony during the Irvin Committee
hearings regarding La Costa meetings." These meetings
at La Costa have since omerced as perhans 2 most crucial
trate sessions involved in the allened cover-un of
Watergate by the President's closest aides. Dean testified
that the La Costa meetines took place over a period of tyvo
days, February 10 - 12, 1973. Dean testified that the sessions
were held in a special villa at La Costa that was used by
Haldeman

It has been during this same veriod of time, in the last

sever , that Eugene Brading (Jin Braden) has become

one of the most important Hafia operatives at La Costa.

According to numerous intelligence reports, from California,

vada, and federal authorities, Brading is now suspected fe

After President John F, Kennedy
was struck down on Nov. 22, 1963, the
Central Intelligence Agency received
evidence suggesting that Cuban Pre-
mier Fidel Castro arranged the assassi-
pein in retaliation for attempts on

life.

Yet sources privy to the secret dis--

cussions at the highest levels of the
CIA during those hectic days now tell
us that the CIA deliberately withheld
the evidence from the Warren Com-
mission investigating Kennedy's death.

Our sources cite two reasons for”

holding back this evidence. One was a

» Tesolve to cover up the secret that the

CIA had enlisted Mafia mobsters to kill
Castro.

There also was a legitimate concern
that the Castro revelations might in-
flame the American people, whose
grief could have turned into a terrible
wrath that might. have precipitated
some rash action.’

Only a few key people knew about
the CIA plot to assassinate Castro. One
was Attorney General Robert, F. Ken-
nedy, who was his brother's personal
watchdog over the CIA. It has now
been established that Robert Kennedy
was briefed on May 7, 1962, about the
attempt to use underworid killers to
knock off Castro.

Two days later, Robert Kennedy cau-

tioned the CIA not to go ahead with
the assassination without consulting
him. Since Robert Kennedy rode herd
on the CIA, it must be assumed that he
was kept advised of subsequent assassi-
nation attempts, However, there is-no
Sccementary evidence of this.

TEPER ERD ORE ORR,

Slain Mobster Claimed
‘Cuban Link lo, JFK Death

By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern
‘Washington Post Staff Writers

Long before his recent murder,
John Rosselli. the CIA's underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in retali-
ation, were involved in the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy.
Rosselli’s belief in a Cuban connec.
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long

ago as March, 1967, and also in private -

conversations with a longtime associ-
ate of Rosselli who’ participated in
meetings between Rosselli ‘and the
CIA. >

* an FBI “blind memorandum” on
an interview with Morgan dated
March 21, 1967, was included, without

identification of the interviewee, in.

last June's Senate Intelligence Co
mittee's report on the role of the in-
telligence community in the Kennedy
assassination investigation.

Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli
ana another Morgan client had in-
formed him that Castro became aware
of CIA assassination conspiracies
against him and “thereafter employed
teams of individuals who were dis-
patched to the United States for the
purpose of assassinating Mr. Ken-
nedy."

Because neither Morgan nor Ros-
selli was identified in the Senate re-
port, the significance of that portion
of the 106-page document was dis-
counted at the time it was published
in June, before Rosselli's disappear-

ance and the subsequent discovery of
his body in an oil drum in Flovida
waters. The Washington Post, however,
has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli
. Were the sources of the testimony that
suggested a Cuban role in the Ken-
nedy murder.

Morgan's account, according. to a
summary of the FBI interview, was
that Rosselli had reached his conclu-
sion about a Cuban connection to the’
Kennedy ‘assassination from
“feedback” furnished by sources close
to Castro who were involved in the CLA
plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 399

“His (Morgan’s) clients were aware
of the identity of some of the individ-
uals who came to the United States
for this purpose and he understood
that two such individuals were now in
the state of New Jersey,” the FBI in-
terview summary stated.

A long-time associate. of Rosselli
who was interviewed separately by
! The Washington Post, said there was
ino question in the slain mobster’s

mind that President Kennedy was
‘killed on Castro's behalf in reprisal
for the CIA schemes against the Cu-
ban leader. :

“He was positive; he was sure,” said
the associate, who knew Rosselli well
and was in contact with him before
Rosselli disappeared from his Florida
home on July 28. The associate, who
does not want to be identified pub-
iliely, is scheduled to be interviewed
“this week by Dade County, Fla., homi-
le detectives. He was a party to Ros
‘selli’s contacts in the early 1960s with

CIA case officers overseeing the at-
tempts to assassinate Castro. ~
Despite occasional speculation, the
collective conclusion of all official
U.S. government investigations into
the Kennedy assassination—including
the Warren Commission, the FBI and
the CIA—has been that there was no
evidence: that implicated the Castro
government or any of its agents.
However, the CIA's inyolvement in
the schemes to assassinate - Castro
was not divulged to the Warren Com-
mission, and knowledge of them was
confined until 1967 to a small, elite
circle of the U'S. intelligence commu-
nity.” President ‘Johnson apparently
‘first learned about the schemes only
after a Mareh 7. 1967, column by the
‘late Drew Person, which prompted
‘Johnson to order a CIA investigation
of the highly sensitive episode.
“Pull details of the CIA-underworld
collusion in the plots to kill Castro
did not surface publicly until the pub-
lication last year of the Senate Intelli-
‘gence Committee's assassination re*
port and the ensuing report last June
on the possible role of the intelligence

agencies in the Kennedy assassination
and investigation.

‘The body of Rosselli, who lived
flamboyantly in a world of mobéters.
politicians and playgirls, was found
two weeks ago in an inverted oil drum
weighted with chains but buoyed by
gases from decomposition on the

The specific cause of death was deter.

mined by an autopsy to be asphyxia.”

tion :

Last year, an underworld colleague
of Rosselli, Sam (Momo) Giancana,
who also had been recruited by the
CIA in the effort to kill Castro, was

found shot to death in his Chicago

home in what police described as a
highly professional job by assailants!
who penetrated the mobster’s per-
sonal security sereen. Giancana was
due to testify before the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee shortly after his
demise. H

Neither murder ttas been solved.

The possibility that Rosselli’s mur-
der might have been related to his
Senate testimony on the CIA schenies
to kill Castro has brought the FBI
into the investigation at the request
of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.

The involvement of Rosselli, Gian-
cana and other underworld figures—
principally Santos Traffieante of
Tampa, Fla., whose one-time Havana
gambling enterprises fell hostage in
1959 to the Cuban revolution—in plots
against Castro had been a closely held
secret within the top echelons of the
CIA and FBI until recently.

‘The tangled chronology of suppres:
sion and eventual disclosure, although
detailed in the June report, has re-
ceived little public attention. Rossel-
I's murder adds significance to those
events.

Here is the sequence, pieced’ to-
gether from the testimony given to
‘Senate intelligence investigators:

Columnist Drew Pearson went to

the late Chief Justice of the United”

States Earl Warren’ late in: January,
1967, and told him that a Washington.
lawyer had confided to him-that one
of his clients said the United States
“had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro
had decided to retaliate.”

Warren declined Pearson's sugges-
tion that he see the lawyer, who was
Edward Morgan. Warren referred the
matter to then Secret Service Direc-
tor James J. Rowley. who on Feb. 13,
1967, wrote FBI Director J. Edgar Ho-
over, informing him of the allegations.

DoclId:32423630 Page 400

; letter for his superiors saying “our in-"

+ Hodver sent the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an “eyes:
is. There is no record of FBI
meetings or discussions of those alle-
gations. At that point the sensitive let-
ter bounced back and forth’in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-
Tacy.

The job of responding to Rowley’s
letter was assigned to the supervisor
of the FBI’s General Investigative Di-
vision who was given responsiility for
the overall assassination investigation
in March 1964.

This official's job was complicated
by the fact that he had never been in-
formed of-what Hoover and his closest
cirele of confidants in the FBI learned
early in  ig62—that the. CIA was
deeply involved: in assassination
attempts against Castro, and promi-
nent American underworld figures, in-
cluding Rosselli and Giancana, had
been recruited for the attempts.

, So on Feb. 15, 1967, the FBI officiat
prepared a draft reply to the Rowley

vestigation uncovered no evidence in-
dicating Fidel Castro officials of the
Cuban Goverpment were involved

“.with-Lee Harvey Oswald in the assas-

sination of President Kennedy. This
“bureau is not conducting, any investi-
gation regarding this matter.” The
FBI official added in later, testimony
that “everyone.in the higher echelons
read this...”

Drew Pearson went ahead and pub-
lished a column on March 7, 1967, vef-
erring to reports that CIA schemes
against Castro's life in 1963 “may
have resulted in a counterptot by Cas-
tro to assassinate President Kenne-
dy.”

Ten days later, Marvin Watson, one
of Lyndon Johnson's chief deputies,
called FBI assistant director Cartha
DeLoach with the message that “the
President had instructed that the FBI
interview (Morgan) concerning any
knowledge he might’ have regarding.
the assassination of _ President Ken-
‘nedy.”

DeLoach told Watson that it ap-
peared Morgan “did not want to be in-
terviewed, and even if he was inter-
viewed he would probably not divulge
the identity of his sourees . . .’ Wal-
son persisted, however. ‘

“Under the circumstances,” De-
Loach concluded in a memo for the.
files, “it appears that we have no al.
ternative: but to interview (Morgan)
and then furnish the results to. Wat:
son in blind memorandum form.”’

‘The interview was assigned to two
agents from the FBI’s General Investi-
gative Division, which the Senate

committee concluded was “puzzling”
because it was the Domestic Intelli-
gence Division which had heen as-
signed responsibility for investigating
possible foreign involvement in the
assassination.

Neither agent was privy to the
knowledge, confined to Hoover and
his top aides, of the CIA’s assassina-
tion plots against Castro. Both agents
testitied eight years later that they
were “surprised” when Morgan al-
luded during the interview to U.S. at-
tempts to assassinate Castro

“These agents stated that they

could not evaluate the lawyer's
(Morgan's) allegations or question him
in detail on them, since they had not
been briefed on the CIA assassination
efforts,” the Senate committee ob-
served.
. On March 21, 1967, the FBI's Wash-
ington Field Office sent headquarters
ten copies of a blind memorandum
summarizing the interview with Mor-
gan.

In a Senate Intelligence Committee
summary of the FBI interview, Mor-
gan was reported to“ have acknow!-
edged that his clients were “on the
fringe of the underworld” and that
they faced “possible prosecution in a
crime not related’to the assassination
Morgan said his clients “were called
upon by a governmental agency to as-
sist in a project which was said to
have the highest governmental ap-
proval, The project had as its purpose
the assassination of Fidel Castro.
Elaborate plans were made, including
the infiltration of the Cuban Govern-
ment and the placing of informants
within key posts in Cuba.”

Morgan also told the FBI, according
to the summary, that Castro had em-
ployed “teams “of individuals who
were dispatched to the United States
for the purpose of assassinating Presi,
dent Kennedy.”

It was not ‘clear then-—not is it to-

‘ day—why Morgan: came forward at

that time to bring’ Rosselli's story to
the ears of the nation’s highest law
enforcement authorities.

It may be relevant that Rosselli had
‘serious legal problems at the time,

In May, 1966, the FBI. threatened to
deport him for living in the United
States under an assumed name unless
he cooperated in an’ investigation of
the Mafia (his true name was Filippo
Saco). At the time, he reached a ClA
contact from the ant{-Castdo conspir-
acy days, CIA security director Col.”

afraid that the mob might Kill him for
talking. Ee

In 1967, after he was arrested ‘for
gambling fraud at the Friars Club‘ in
Beverly Hills, Rosselli approached his
former CIA case officer, William Har-
vey, who sought unsuccessfully fo in-
tercede in the prosecution.

it was against this background that
Morgan went, first to Drew Pearson, *
and then the FBI, with ,Rossélli’s scn-
sational allegations of CIA plotting
against Castro and the Cuban counter.
espionage directed against ‘President ;
Kennedy. :

Last April, Rosselli told the Senate
Intelligence Committee He had no rec-
ollcction. of either receiving informa. “|
tion that Castro retaliated against |
President Kennedy or of. having dis- i

i

cussed it with Morgan. This meant ei:
ther that Rosselli suffered a dramatic
memory loss or that Morgan's state-
ment to FBI agents nine years.earlier
was a pure invention, a Serious risk
for an established Washington lawyer.

No committee source could explain
the discrepancy, and Morgan declined
to confirm that Rosselli was the client
in question or to discuss either his
Allegations against the Cuban govern-
ment or his recent testimony.

‘The internal FBI memo on the 1967
interview with Morgan was sent, to
headquarters with a transmittal slip
saying: “No further investigation is
being conducted by the Washington
field office unless it is advised to the
contrary by the Bureau.”

The Senate intelligence committee,
in commenting on this position, said
that “had the interviewing agents
known of the CIA-underworld plots
against Castro, they would have been
aware that the lawyer had clients who
had been active in the assassination
plots.” :

On March 21, FBI headquarters for-
warded the Washington field office
memo to the White House, the attor-
ney general and the Secret Service..It
did. not recommend any further in-
vestigation of Morgan’s allegations.

On the evening of. the following
day, President Johnson called CIA Di-
rector Richard M. Helms to'the White
House. The next morning; March 23,
Helms ordered the CIA inspector gen- |
eral to prepare a report on the CIA |
involvement in the assassination plots !

‘The call, she said, came from an old

gle. Mrs, Harvey said that Mrs. Daigle
told the mutual acquaintance that the
Rosselli family had received a tele-
phone threat from unidentified Cu-
bans prior to Rosselli's disappearance.

y. She also said that Rosselli had gone to
meet the Cubans in an effort to pro-
tect his family. .~ *

Mrs. Daigle could not be reached by

ter of Rosselli said she had heard of

Harvey, who died at age 60 and

‘whose exploits as a clandestine opera-

mobster with poison pills, explosives,
detonators, rifles, handguns, radios
and boat radar for transmission to!
anti-Castro Cuban agents. Harvey and

“ Rosselli,-a CIA superior testified to

the Senate committee, “developed a
close friendship.” '*

Another CIA official who worked
with Rosselli, James'R. O'Connell, was
asked if he knew whether the agency
transmitted information! to the mob-
ster on possible Cuban involvement in

ithe Kennedy assassination. He replied
that he was out of the qountry at the
time Kennedy was killgd, and had. no
further comment. nm
. Two months before the Kennedy as.
sassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, who
was identified by the Wafren Commi:
sion as Kennedy's mufderer, had trav-
eled to Mexico City'in an attempt to
gain entry to Cuba. According to the
Warren Commission, Oswald repre-
sented himself as the head of the New
Orleans branch of the Fair Play for
Cuba organization and a friend of the

_ Cuban Revolution.

Some three months before Kennedy
was killed, Castro told Associated
Press reporter Daniel Harker that
U.S. leaders aiding terrorist plans to
eliminate Cuban leaders would them-
selves not be safe.

A US. government committee coor-
dinating policy toward Cuba at tho

+ time agreed there is a strong liklihood
that Castro would retaliate im some
fashion. However, it concluded Castro
would not risk a major confrontation
with the US. by attacking U.S. lead-
ers.

On the same day Kennedy was as-
sassinated, a CLA officer met with a
high-ranking’ Cuban official, who had
said he would kill Castro, to tell him.
the U.S. would provide him with ex-
plosives and a poison pen device

While the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee said it found no evidence suffi-
cient te justify a conclusion that the
Kennedy assassiriation was part of a
conspiracy, it also said U.S. ‘agencies
did not properly investigate the assas-
sination ,or tell the Warren Commis-
_ about the 1A plots on Castro's
life.

“There is no indication that the FBL
or the CIA directed the interviewing:
of Cuban sources or sources within
the Cuban exile community,” the Sen-
ate committce said.

According to a former FBI official
in charge of key aspects of the FBI's
probe of the Kennedy murder, the
FBI never satisfactorily determined
what Oswald planned to do in Cuba or
what he had done in Russia.

The JFK Assassination: Curiosity

ptember 12, 1976

An inquisitive American learns many things on a
visit to Cuba. One of the most surprising is that high
officials in Havana seem genuinely hopeful that the
investigation of the Kennedy assassination will be re-
opened. They are convinced that there was.a Cuban
factor in the murder. : i

“Conversations with senior officials of the Cuban
“government, including Deputy Prime Minister Carlos.
Rafael Rodriguez, make clear that they have followed
closely the disclosures by the Senate Intelligence
Committee casting doubt upon the Warren Commis-
sion jnvestigation. The Cubans are well aware that the
doubts center on the failure of the CLA and the FBI to
inform the Warren Commission of the several plots
mounted by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro. Knowledge
of these plots appears to have been withheld even
from the FBI and CIA officials who were responsible
for investigating the President's murder and for sup-
porting the work of the Warren Commission. As a're-
sult, there was no special effort to explore the possi-
ble involvement of either the Cuban government or
Cuban exiles in the assassination. Evidence developed
by the Senate committee makes both hypotheses plau-
sible—and a new inquiry imperative. iisicted ste

‘The situation is murkier and more perplexing than
ever. Those'who are resistant to conspiracy theories
and who have been prepared—even eager —to be-
lieve that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone can no
longer rely on the Warren Commission report as,an

adequate prop for their predilections. The commis-,
sion did not know that on Nov. 22, 1969, at about the

very hour Oswald struck in Dallas, an agent of the’
Central Intelligence Agency was meeting with a rank-
ing Cuban official (codenamed AMLASH and re-;
cently identified as Rolando Cubela) to plan the mur-;
der of Castro. Simultaneously, in Cuba, a French re-;
porter, Jean Daniel, was spending the day with Cas-

tro, conveying to the Cuban leader views expressed

by President Keapedy in a brief interview at the:
White House on Oct. 2, persuading Castro that Ken-+
nedy. wanted to explore ways to normalize relations.

. Thus, at the moment the President was killed, U.S.

policy. toward Cuba appeared to be moving not only

‘on two tracks but in opposite directions, and move.
ment on either track could have provoked violent re-
sponse by one or another Cuban faction.

Perceptions inside the Cuban government re-
sponded to both tendencies in U.S. policy. There is
good reason to suspect that the AMLASH operation
involved a double agent, or at least a singularly inept

in Havana

onie, Castro almost certainly knew of it. The CIA even-
tually concluded that the AMLASH activity was “inse-
cure” and terminated it. Among other discoveries,
within two days of the assassination it was known (but.
not to the Warren Commission) that AMLASH had
been in contact with Soviet personnel in Mexico City, ;
where Oswald had gone in September 1963 to visit
both the Cuban and Soviet consulates. Whether these.
facta are significant or merely coincidental, one can-
not tell. In retrospect, Cuban authorities note with
some relief that Oswald was denied permission to visit

», Cuba, implying that, bad his request been granted;
the finger of suspicion would surely have, pointed at,

Havana,“ *

Perhaps more suggestive of a direct leak from AM:
. LASH te Castro was the sequence of events on. Sept. 7,
1963, when the CIA re-established contact with the Cu-
ban conspirator for the first time since the preceding *
year. Late that evening, Prime Minister Castro called
in Associated Press reporter Daniel Harker for an un- ‘
expected interview. Only three: Western reporters.
were based in Havana at the time and their contact
with Castro was quite limited. Evidently, the Cuban
leader had a message he wished to get on the record
through Harker. He charged that the United States
, Was aiding terrorist plots in Cuba and warned U.S.
‘leaders that “if they are aiding terrorist plans to elimi-
nate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be safe.”
‘This threat of reprisals seems less inflammatory
and more understandable now that we know what
Castro knew at the time, namely, that the United
States was in fact stepping up its covert operations
against Cuba during the summer and fall of 1963. Yet
it seems an exception to the main lines of Cuban pol-
cicy as it was then evolving. ‘
‘ For months afer the missile crisis of 1962, Castro
jhad been displeased with the Soviets, and there are
signs that he was interested in an opening to Wash-
ington. ‘On Sept. 5, the. Cubans quietly proposed. talks.
with the Americans at the United Nations,:and Ken-,¢
edy soon responded with interest. Also, in early Sep-
tember the Time magazine bureau chief in Buenos *
Aires, Gavin Scott, travelling on a Canadian passport,
spent two weeks in Cuba. Although key US. officials
have no recollection of consulting with Scott on that :
occasion, the Cubans recall his questions and com-.
ments as hinting of American interest in a-possible acy
commodation, much.as they were‘later to interpret ,
the discussions between Jean Daniel and Castro.
Then and now the Cubans’ attitude toward Ken:
nedy has been a compound of political antipathy andy _
personal admiration. While critical of Kennedy's role ..
in various counter-revolutionary efforts, Castro and *
his associates voice a warm, almost affectionate re-
gard for the President’s courage and realism. They



aa

profess to have seen his death as a grave setback to ,
more hopeful relations between the two countries.
The John Kennedy of 1963 was not, in their judgment,,,
the same man who was inaugurated in 1961, but a 2
more mature, poised and forward-looking leader with’ i
whom they could have done business,

With this frame of reference, Cuban officials specu-
late that the real origin of the assassination lies in an-.
ti-Castro circles, with which Oswald also was in touch.
They emphasize that assassination is incompatible
with their own revolutionary doctrine and that they

, never contemplated it even against Batista, the pre-

vious Cuban ruler. And they volunteer the suspicion #
that the recent murders of Sam Giancana and Johnny
Rosselli, the Mafia figures who consorted with the
CIA to kill Castro, surely have some connection with
Uuban exile politics and the Kennedy murder.

Castro has said publicly that he has no proof “count-
er-revolutionary elements” planned the assassination,
but that is clearly the consensus in Havana. Further >
investigation. may still be inconclusive, but, far from’:
seeing it as an impediment to Cuban-American rela-
tions, the Castro regimé welcomes such an inquiry.
‘Their curiosity seems greater than their complicity.

Could Rosselli Have Linked.
Castro Plot to JFK Death?

By RON LaBRECQUE
Herald Statt Writer

In 1960, when the CIA was try-
ing to set up a delicate attempt on
the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to
a man once described as ‘the big-
gest’ flag-waving SOB in the coun-
try” — West Coast underworld

‘figure Johnny Rosselli.

Rosselli — a seemingly improba-
ible conspirator in a government
plot — got the “flag-waving” label
from Salvatore (Momo) Giancana,
then Chicago’s top crime boss and
a man Rosselli brought into that
“same plot.

Now both are dead, murdered in
the past year, and investigators are
wondering whether their plotting
led to their deaths and whether the
CIA plots against Castro — only
recently made public and even kept
from the Warren Commission —
are vitai clues to the John F. Ken-
nedy assassination.

The aeaths of Giancana, in’ June
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,
have aroused a renewed concern in
Washington, where on Friday the

House of Representives voted to re+
Open the investigation of the Ken-
nedy murder,

REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,
Va.), who will be chairman of the
Panel, said he is “convinced”:a con-'
spiracy was involved-in Kennedy's
death.

Now, in the aftermath of the vi-,
olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-
selli, the question arises of what
role, if -any, the Kennedy White
House played in the early 1960s
“deal” the CIA made with the two
underworld figures to have Castro
murdered. :

Whether “the Kennedy” White’
House knew ‘about about the. CIA's
plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found
out after the contacts were ended),
the CIA's use of the underworld

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 404

‘seems ironic in retrospect.

| Robert Kennedy's passionate ef-
forts to disable organized crime are
well documented.

IN 1960 when Robert Kennedy

wrote about what he had learned
of organized crime in America
from his years as chief counsel to
the Senate Rackets Committee, he
too quoted Giancana to make a
point.

He told about Giancana’s inter
view at his local draft board at the
outbreak of World War II, when
jhe was asked what he did for a liv-

ing.

“I steal.” Giancana is said to

have replied.
So Sam Giancana didn't go to
‘war and years later would boast to
Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that
the stayed out of the Army — la-
‘beled unfit — by telling the truth.

“What's wrong with the syndi-
“cate?” Kennedy, quoted Giancana.
“Two or three of us get together
jon a business deal and everybody
{says it’s a bad thing. Businessmen
;do it all the time and nobody
‘squawks:"

A Senate committee began stu-:
laying the Kennedy. questions more
‘than a year ago as it looked at co~
Hvert CIA activities,

IN AN addendum to the Senate
‘Intelligence Committee's interim
sreport last November, Sen. Howard
iBaker (R., Tenn.) said, “It is my
‘personal view that on balance the
jlikelihood that presidents (the re-
port deait with Dwight Eisenhower
and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro)
assassination plots is greater than
the likelihood that they did not.”

dust to trace Rosselli's history
with the CIA is mind-boggling for
‘the investightors. Yet, it is just one
‘aspect of the search for his killer.
© Johnny Rosselli — born on the
fourth of July in Esperia, Italy, and
‘71 when he died — was not first
and foremost a CIA operative.

© His greater role’as.evidenced by
two convictions, his associations
and to some extent his own com-
ments, was as an influential, if
publicly lesser known, organized,
grime figure.

g HIS ASSOCIATION with other
‘Identified underworld members
was monitored by law enforcement
agencies as recently as several
weeks ‘before ‘his July 28 disap-
‘pearance. :
* By all accounts, Rosselli was a‘
charming man, dressing in expen-
‘sive clothes, married for only two *
fyears in the early 1940s and
iknown most of his life as one who
leasily’attracted women.
} He wag an immigrant who told
lin a short autobiography written
‘about 1967 that his “life of crime”
began as a teenager in Boston, at-
tempting arson for his. stepfather
pind stealing $50 on his own. As he
raveled west, finally to settle in.
‘California, his attention turned to +
jbootlegging, gambling and dab-
ling in the movie business.
1 ITAS said that Rosselli guarded
ithe West Coast gambling interests
for Giancana's Chicago syndicate.
+ Why Rosselli was chosen by the
(CIA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un-
clear, although CIA officials have
‘since testified that they wanted the
kind of contacts in Cuba which or-
ganized crime had made during the
ypre-Castro days when Havana was
‘a.gamblers’ haven.’

Giancana was enlisted by Rossel-
li because he had influence ‘with
Florida’s Santo Trafficante. consid-
ered the key underworld gambling
figure in Havana.

The unraveling of CIA and un-°
derworld conspiracies, an awesome :,
iweb spanning decades, is left to a
jeam of nine in the, Metro Homicide
Division. it is a team now clearly
consumed by the task which has
been a full-time operation since
Rosselli's body was pulled from
Dumfoundling Bay on Aug. 7.


HW 50955

THAT THE Metro team is even
involved is happenstance. Rosselli
lived in Plantation, Broward Coun-
ty. with his sister and brother-in-
law. It's just that his killers chose
to dump his body in Dade.

While several _ detectives say
their instincts lead them to con-
clude that the Rosselli murder was
an internal underworld affair, all *
‘on the team are aware of the pres-__,
sure on them to search each clue
that leads back to the CIA-Castro
affair.
~ With Rosselli's death this sum-
mer, the newly appointed Senate
committee saw its list of knowl
edgeable witnesses further trim-
med. Some of those witnesses have
died violently and some from natu-
ral causes.

: When Giancana was murdered in
June of 1975, before he could even
be questioned by the committee
staff, authorities attributed it to an
internal gangland struggle — even
though. the murderer is still un-
known. |

The death of Rosselli, who had
appeared before the committee
three times in the past year with-
out immunity, caused greater con-

cern on Capitol Hill.

‘THE SAME night Rosselli's body
was identified — the legs hacked
off and stuffed along with the body
into an oil drum — Baker, vice
chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called for the FBI to
get involved in the case. (Several
days Jater, Attorney General Ed-
ward Levi ordered FBI involve-
ment.)

It wasn't until several weeks
later, however, that what was
known to Baker became public
knowledge. :

A section of the former commit-
ctee’s April report told of a Wash-
ington attorney who in 1967 went
to Supreme Court Chief Justice
Earl Warren (chairman of the
then-disbanded Warren Commis-
sion) to say that two’of his clients
believed they knew about Cuban
agents in the United States who -
conspired in the assassination of
« John F. Kennedy,, : at

THE INFORMATION. eventually
reached the FBI, but as the Senate
committee concluded this year, the
1967 FBI probe was slipshod and
incomplete. :

One of the clients referred to in
the report has.since been identified”
as Rosselli. And it has since been
jearned that Rosselli. was con-
vinced he held a vital clue to the
JFK murder.

DocId:32423630 Page 405

“There was never the slightest
doubt in John’s mind that Castro

was responsible for the assassina--

tion of Kennedy,” said Edward P.
Morgan, the attorney referred to in
the report.
Morgan is an attorney of no
mean stature in Washington. He
~ served as chief counsel to the joint
congressional " committee | which
studied the Pearl Harbor’ attack,
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and for seven
years was chief inspector of the

ROSSELLI told Morgan about
the CIA plot in 1967, when the De-
partment of Justice was vigorously
attempting to deport Rosselli for
being an illegal alien.

Rosselli, Morgan said, “was cer-

tain that the people he (Rosselli) .

put around Castro in the CIA plot
turned right around and killed Ken-
nedy. The people he still knew (in
1967) did it.”

Rosselli, according to Morgan,
decided to talk about his CIA activ-
ity in hopes of decreasing the pres-
sure from the FBI and Department
of Naturalization and Immigration,.
both Justice Department agencies.

Several friends of Rosselli, i
cluding Morgan, say they are con-
vinced the FBI tried to get Rosselli
to become an organized crime. in-

formant by threatening to have.

him deported if he ‘didn't coopera-
te. i

IN 1961, through a bungled,
wiretap “effort,” the FBI* became;
aware of Rosselli's CIA activities.

While Giancana and _ Rosselli
were in Florida planning the opera-
tion, Giancana wanted to return to
Las Vegas to check on his girl
friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he
suspected’ of dating comedian Dan
Rowan. To keep Giancana in. Flori-
da, it was agreed that a bug would
be placed in her hotel room and her
conversations monitored.

But the private detective they
hired, with CIA money it has since
been learned, was discovered and

arrested. Eventually the police in- ;

vestigation led back to the Castro
plotters.

Prosecution was avoided when
the CIA intervened and said the
“national interest” would be dam-
aged if the plot information be-
came public.

WHEN THE wiretap case was
again to be investigated in 1966,
this time by a Senate committee
headed by the late Sen. Edward
Long (D., Mo.), the CIA again step-
ped in to stop it.

Morgan was told about the pend-
ing investigation by Rosselli and
Robert Mahue, a former FBI
agent-turned Howatd Hughes aide
who was the CIA's. initial link to
Rosselli.

Mahue told Morgan that both he
and Rosselli had been subpenaed to.
appear before the committee. Mor-
gan said he called Lawrence Hous-:
ton, the CIA general counsel. Hous+
ton went to Long and the investi-
gation was dropped.

MORGAN SAID he knew, as the”
‘Senate committee recently empha-
sized as well, that all information
about the CIA plots — which could
have been the incentive for pro-*
Castro forces to kill Kennedy —
had been kept from the Warren
Commission.

“Twas an admirer of Earl War-
ren,” Morgan said. ‘(His) report
said that ... Oswald alone killed,
Kennedy. It kept bugging me after
so gruesome a detail from Rosselli
that the Chief Justice could put his
name on a report which didn't as-
sess the ‘most significant piece of
evidence bearing on the killing of
Kennedy.” - -

The information Morgan had
‘was passed to Warren via colum-
nist. Drew Pearson, a mutual
friend. Eventually, it reached the
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di-
rect orders from President Lyndon
Johnson in the sprig of 1967, in-
vestigation was not vigorously pur-
sued. :

THE SENATE Intelligence Com-
mittee compared that apparent. in-
action with a statement former FBI
director J. Edgar Hoover made to
the Warren Commission on May 5,
1964. Hoover said, “well, I can as-
sure. you so far as the FBI is con-
cerned the case will be continued:
in an_open classification for. all
time. That is, any information com-
ing to us or any report coming to.
us from any source will’ be thor-
oughly investigated, so that we,

Swill be “able“to prove or disprove!
“the allegation.” :

A Senate Committee staff mem«
ber commented recently. “what is"
really happening is that the investi-
gation which the FBI should have
done in 1967 — and no one can
come close to explaining why it
wasn't — is actually being done
nowsnee

HART, AS have local investiga~
tors, has established three possible
scenario's for Rosselli's death: his
recent organized crime activity. re-
taliation for his Castro assassina+
tion efforts or the information he
held concerning the JFK assassina-
tion.


HW 50955

“Maybe Roo information
was the vital .nerve of the Kennedy
assassination,” a Senate source.told
‘The Herald. -

High officials in the Cuban gov- *

ernment also reportedly feel there
was a “Cuban factor"sin the JFK
; death, but they see it as a result of
* exile politics, according to a recent
article by Alton Frye, a senior fel-
low of the Council Foreign Rela-
tions in Washington.
Frye wrote that he visited Ha-

‘Vana recently and met with Cuban,

officials including Deputy Prime
Minister Carlos ‘Rafael Rodriguez.
“.. they volunteer the suspicion
that the recent murders of Sam Gi-
ancana and Johnay Rosselli ...
surely have some connection with

) Cuban exile politics'and the Kenne-
dy murder,” Frye wrote.

THERE HAVE been theories re-
cently propounded to show why
doth pro and anti-Castro forces
could have wanted to get JFK out
of power in 1963.

On the one hand, there is the re-
port of French journalist Jean Dan-
jel, who was the bearer to Castro
of an offer from.JFK for calmer re-

yJations. Castro was reportedly

agreeable, The report stated that;

©Daniel later was Junching with

Castro when word came that Ken-
nedy had been shot. Daniel de-
scribed the Cuban leader as genu-
inely shocked by the news.

It has since been learned that
probably in the very hour JFK was
shot, a one-time Castro supporter
was receiving a poison pen device
from a CIA agent in what was 4
long-running anti-Castro effort.
That Cuban agent was code-named
AM/LASH, and he has since been
identified as Rolando Cuebala, now
imprisoned in Cuba for his assassi-
nation plotting.

WHETHER JFK had knowledge

of, or perhaps even approved, any:

of the assassination piots will prob-
" ably never be known.
His ‘closest advisers, who testi-
' fied before the Senate Committee,
‘all said he had no knowledge of
such plots and would never have
«approved of them.
The same month Rosselli was
passing poison pills to his Cuban
» contact at a meeting at the ‘Fon-
+ tainebleau, March of 1961, former
Florida Sen. George Smathers, a
friend of Kennedy, said he and

DocId: 32423630

Page 406

Kennedy discussed the ramifica-"
tions of a Castro assassination.

Smathers has since said Kennedy
rejected the idea and that the dis-
cussion was more of a “brain-pick-
ing” session. :

AT LEAST one high-level CIA
official did testify he believed the
White House was being briefed on
the plots but according to Richard
Bissell, one of the officials who
originally decided to use Rosselli, it
was through the method of “plau-
sible deniability.”

That, according to the recent
Senate report, “can also lead to the
use of euphemism and circumlocu-'
tion, which are designed to allow
the President and other senior offi-
cials to deny knowledge of an op-
eration should it be disclosed.”

Another alleged link between’
the White House and the under-
world plotters, first made public by
the Senate Committee, has also
been denied by virtually everyone
involved. Judith Campbell Exner,
the woman who claims to have

_been friend and lover to both Gian-

cana and JFK, introduced to both
by Frank Sinatra, was not a link in

the Castro plotting, those close’ to =
both Giancana and Kennedy have ‘

said. , :

A MAN with acéess to Kenne-
dy's closest advisers told The Her-
ald recently, “The Giancana-Ros-
selli thing is unrelated to the Exner
thing. I was there. Sure JFK knew
her, but he was naive about those
kinds of things.”

There is documentation to show
that on March. 22, 1962, Hoover
lunched privately with Kennedy
and presumably gave him his first
information linking Exner with the
gangsters. The final: recorded
phone call between the White

House and Exner was made only a ¢

few hours later. ; © B
Another possible tink discussed

in the Senate report shows that the /

same unidentified Cuban:to whom |

Rosselli passed the poison pills
prior to the Bay of Pigs operation
in April of 1961, was among a

group of Cuban exile leaders who :

met with JFK following the inva-
sion fiasco.

.IT IS known that several of the

Cubans + with whom __ Rosselli
worked have been identified, but
investigators say that not all are
known.

As a condition to his appear-
ances before the Senate Committee.’
in the past year, it was agreed that >
Rosselli ‘would not state the
names or confirm the existence of,
those agents whom he knew}
about,” Rosselli's attorney . Leslie $
Scheer said. st

But a “committee source: ‘cau-"
tioned, “they (Cuban agents) read
the committee's report, they know °
who's being referred to.”

ANOTHER Rosselli attorney, .
‘Tom Wadden, a partner of Edward *
Bennett Williams, said, “Yes, If
think he had more knowledge’
than he testified to. -

Searching Rosselli's more recent
past. for. enemies also presents

, Problems, investigators say. "*

The decline of John Rosselli ap-
pears to begin in the late 1960s. In
1967, he was convicted jin a card-
cheating scandal at the posh, celeb- |
rity-filled Friar’s Club in- Los An-
geles where the influence of Sina-
tra had made him a member ac~"
cording to investigators.

Deportation pressures were also
mounting at this time.

ROSSELLI entered prison on the
conviction in 1970 where he would
serve three years of a five-year,
sentence.

In 1971; he was brought td a.
federal grand jury in Los Angeles
which was probing whether some
indentified Detroit organized crime

leaders conspited with the Emprise.
Corp. — a giant firm with nation-;
wide race track and sporting event?
concessions — to: hide financial in-!
terests in the Frontier Hotel in’ Las.
Vegas. = E

Rosselli, too, had, an interest in
the Frontier, which opened in 1967.
He owned the gift shop concession
along, with a partner named Joe-
Breen. How Rosselli obtained the
concession is unclear, but’ Breen.
said it gave Rosselli an’ income of
about $60,000.

ROSSELLI at one time hdd been:
a major influence in Las Vegas.
Several sources sajd that when the
owners of the Desert Inn wanted
Howard Hughes to move out of the
penthouse — because. his special
needs were costly and ‘putting



HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 407

some “high rollers” in would be
more profitable — it was Rosselli
who patched things up.

Hughes eventually bought the
Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier.

What Rosselli told the federal
grand “jury about the Frontier. in
1971 is unknown.. Rosselli didn't
testify later at the trial at which
Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael Pol-
izzi and the Emprise.Corp., among
others, were convicted.

ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in
jail. In 1973, the House of Repre-
sentatives Select Committee on
Crime: probed the influence of or-
ganized crime in sports — and one
area they looked at was Emprise
and the Frontier Hotel case.

At the time of the conviction, the
federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-
zi and Terilli be jailed immediately,
because monitored, wiretapped
conversations showed that the two
had talked about “murder, the kill-
ing of certain individuals.”

‘An intimate associate of Rosselli,
however, discounts the possibility
that Rosselli's grand jury appear-
ance could have led to his death.
“They know Johnny didn’t talk to
the grand jury,” the associate said.

JOE BREEN said -Rosselli hadn't
been to Las Vegas for nine years,
that “he's never even seen the gift
shop.”

Since his prison release and
move to Plantation, Rosselli wasn’t
trying to regain power: according
to his friends. “He had no muscle,”
said an associate." can’t believe
Rosselli was getting back into' mob
stuff.”

But at the same time, many of
the: associates were surpised to
learn about Rosselli's recent visits
with alleged organized ¢rime fig-
ures on the West Coast.

Several associates speculate that
Rosselli. wanted to get involved in
casino gambling, preferably in the
Middle East, and was looking for
someone with money to back him.

“MY IMPRESSION was that he
was broke,” Morgan said. “He told
me last year, ‘I’m in. bad. financial.
straits.’ ” ‘
“Scheer said Rosselli's income in-
cluded about $60,000 from the gift
shop and about $3,500 in social se-
curity, most of which went for
back fees to attorneys and for gov-
_ernment fines. seeeiteee

One friend said! that just before
Giancana’s death, |Rosselli had ac-
cepted Giancana’s|offer of money.
The friend was to|act as-the inter-
mediary. “Let me|figure out what
my next (attorney's) tab willbe,”
the friend quoted! Rosselli as say-
ing. Beier oe

Rosselli is described as a man
with a sense of humor who did lit-
tle offending.

A California woman who had
known Rosselli for about 40 years
told ‘The Herald,’ “If you were
ardund him for 30 minutes you'd
like him because he would regard

you as a human being ba
“If you had a headache he would

either get you an|aspirin or send
someone to get one. I said: some-
thing significant there — he would
get it or he would send someone —
he wasn't a pansy, ibut he wasn’t a
tough guy either.” |

SUBJEC

PURPOSE:
-

To advise you that an Agent of the Secret Service, when —_
testifying before the President's Commission, denied making certain
statements to FBI Agents which were subsequently reported to the
Commission, .

DETAILS: s ail

2 ° In Volume II of the hearings before the President's
*ConmisSion commencing on page G61 there appears the testimony
of Roy H. Kellerman, Assistant Special Agent, White House Detail, po
U.S. Secret“Service on 3-9-G4, *In Charge '

sh

Under questioning by a Commission member, Kellerman
was asked about certain statements reportedly made by him on i

11-22-63, to SA's Francis %. O Neill, Jr. and James . Sibert, g

of our Baltimore Office, which appear in the 12-10-G3 Dallas

report of Special Agent Robert P. Gemberling (page 3, paragraph .
4). SA's O'Neill and Sibert were under orders to be observers

during the autopsy of president Kennedy at the National Naval _f

Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, which commenced on the
evening of 11-22-63, to be of assistance to the Secret Service, /
and to look after the Bureau's interests.

>. Qur Agents, in conversation with’ Kellerman,
during the evening of 11-22-63, learned of pertain i
portions of which were reported as follows 3122 climes &
oN TEA
"He advised he heard a shot’ and -hnediacely, ‘
turned around, looking past Governor Connally;

- A. Rosen te Mr, Belmont Hemo
RE; PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION

; The Commission in questioning Kellerman made specific oe
veference to the underscored portions of the above paragraph i
q as it contradicts some of Kellerman's testimony. Kellerman ate

claims he did not ..hear the President. nor Mrs, Kennedy say
these things and had never told our Agents that he had. In
part of Kellerman's denial he stated "I don't know where they
got those quotes,"

OBSERVATIONS:

Kellerman is claiming our Agents furnished inaccurate :
accounts of a conversation with him. It is to be remembered
that at the time this conversation with our Agents reportedly

took place 11-22-63, Kellerman had been a security guard in
the Presidmt's car and more than likely was upset and feeling
remorse over the days episode, In his testimony before the
Commission hetendeavored to give the impression that he’ acted

* calmly and immediately took command, issuing logical instructions
after the Presiddat was hit, The conversation reported by ae

~——- our Agents made it appear Kellerman reacted normally to the

tragedy and not dramatically as indicated in his testimony,
as he didn't order the driver tothe hospital until after the

President had so directed.
It is felt our Agents reported accurately what
Kellerman told them on 11-22+463, and that Kellerman's testimony
3} months later is the result of considered deliberation, on
his part, to paint the most favorable picture possible, under ae
the circumstances, for the Secret Service. :
Consideration has been given to discussing this matter | nnadl

with Chief Rowley of Secret Service, however, since it is the
word of our Agents against Kellerwan's, it is not felt any good
purpose would be served by this course of action.

RECOMMENDATION: 7

Affidavits are being obtained from our Agents Sibert
and O'Néill attesting to the accuracy of their report and
refuting Kellerman sc that we will be in a position to show
any future inquirer that we recognized this contradiction and
did gome thing about it,

hingten Me.

By Jack Anderson
and Les Whitten
The FBI withheld from the

Warren Commission hundreds
of documents about the

assassination’ of President .,

Kennedy.

“These are raw FBI files,
which the — commission
requested but never received.
They contain no startling
information that will overturn
the commission's verdict, but
they reveal intimately how the
FBI handied its most im-
portant case.

In the margins of some
suppressed memos, the late
FBI chief, J, Edgar Hoover,
scribbled caustic comments in
blue ink, He was critical of
almost everyone involved in
the investigation, from Dallas
police chief Jesse Curry to
President Lyndon Johnson.

Confidential notes kept by

sone top FBI official, for
example, quote Hoover as
warning: “Johnson may
become very dictatorial. We
‘inust keep our guard up.”

+} Sources familiar with the

suppressed documents say the
contents. were summarized
and submitted to the Warren
Commission. But there were
some subtle, _ perhaps
deliberate, omissions,

The documents show that
Hoover brought pressure on
his subordinates to rush out a
preliminary report on the FBI
investigation before the

murdered President's -

brother, Robert F, Kennedy,
returned to his desk as
Attorney General.

The confidential notes qu.’

Hoover as instructing his

s,, Subordinates to get the rey srt

“6 TEST (0127 fs Celcout of the Justice Departnicnt

“before Bobby gets back,” -
Apparently, the FBI chief

also feared Deputy Attorney -

General Nicholas deB. Kai-
zenbach might, tamper with
the report before forwarding it
fo the Warren Commission.
Hoover told his aides to alert
President Johnson's major-
domo, Waller Jenkins.

“Let Jenkins know after
report is out of our hands.”
Hoover directed, “Let Jenkins
know what Katzenbach is
doing. Might cause long delay.
Must not consider any
alteration.” i

Thirteen days alter
President Kennedy was
gunned down in Dallas,
Hoover delivered a detailed
report to Katzenbach naming
Lee Harvey Oswald as the.
assassin. Katzenbach kept it
four days before submitting it
to the commission.

The crusty old G-man was
furious at the Dallas police
chief, meanwhile, for leaking
the story that the FBI had
investigated Oswald but had
failed “to alert the Secret
Service. ;
his is the lowest level in
history of Bureau since I have
been director," Hoover
lamented, according to the
confidential notes.

He contended that Oswald
had never been seen with
firearms, had written no hate
leers against U.S. leaders.
As a former defector, he also
knew he was a marked man
whom the FBI was watching,

“With that background,”

a

DocId: 32423630 Page

447

xrumbled Hoover, “how could.
he be security risk? No in-
dication of violence so far as

our records show. . . Oswald
could have hollered false
arrest if we had arrested
him.”

‘The FBI chief commented
that’ Chief Justice Earl
Warren, who headed the
commission, “would have
been first one to holler” about
Oswald's rights. Citing the
criticism of the FBI, Hoover
commented: “This is one of
the rough ones.”

He felt, therefore, that
President Johnson should
have endorsed the FBI report.

“President should have
backed up report," com-
plained Zuvver, “based on

eviderze gathered by the
FR.” '

In private remarks that
were never intended to be
Tepeated outside his inner
circle, he made deprecating
remarks not only about
President Johnson but about
Sen, Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz.), who was then
preparing to run against LBJ
for the presidency.
“Goldwater has no sound
advisers around him,” Hoover
noted. But his comment on
Johnson was more deadly:
“LBJ's speeches are dull.”
The’ Warren Commission
adopted a _ resolution,
meanwhile, calling for “the
raw materials upon which any
reports given to the com-
mission are based, together

BI Withheld Deta on JFK Slaying

with all raw materials and
reports relating to the work of
the commission since the date
of any and all earlier reports."

J. Lee Rankin, the general

counsel, followed up with a.:

"Dear Edgar” letter to. the
FBI chief requesting the full
files ‘tas promptly as
possible,”
never delivered,

A’ commission
remembering
more
told us: ‘Nobody ever got the
FBI's own files.” In 1963-64,
another staff member pointed
out, the FBI “could do no

lawyer,

-wrong,” so no one pressed too
internal -

hard for their
records.

Now 12 -years alter the
‘Kennedy assassination. a
fascinating story is still locked
in FBI files awaiting a public
reopening. We will tell part of
the story in future columns,

stoup had “directed mischievous
things against Castro like infiltrating

McCone insisted, however, that “the

After President John F. Kennedy
was struck down on Nov. 22, 1963, the
Central Intelligence Agency received
evidence suggesting that Cuban Pre-
mier Fidel Castro arranged the assassi-
nation in retaliation for attempts on
his life.

Yet sources privy to the secret dis-
cussions at the highest levels of the
CIA during those hectic days now tell,
us that the CIA deliberately withheld
the evidence from the Warren Com-|
mission investigating Kennedy’s death.

Our sources cite two reasons for
holding back this evidence. One was a
resolve to cover up the secret that the
CIA had enlisted Mafia mobsters to kill

0.

There also was a legitimate concern
that the Castro revelations might in-
flame the American people, whose
grief could have turned into a terrible
wrath that might have precipitated
‘some rash action.

Only a few key people knew about
the CIA plot to assassinate Castro. One
was Attorney General Robert F. Ken-
nedy, who was his brother's personal
watchdog over the CIA. It has now
been established that Robert Kennedy
was briefed on May 7, 1962, about the
attempt to use underworld killers to
knock off Castro.

Two days later, Robert Kennedy cau-
tioned the CIA not to go ahead with
the assassination without consulting
him. Since Robert Kennedy rode herd
. . on the CIA, it must be assumed that he

Records now available show that

Edgar Hoover of the plot on May 10,

1962. Yet neither Kennedy nor Hoover
later divulged this important informa-
tion to the Warren Commission.

Of course, various CIA officials also
knew about the assassination scheme.
Not the least of them was the late CIA
chief Allen W. Dulles, who approved
the original plan. He later served on
the Warren Commmission, yet he sat
silently throughout the investigation
without mentioning the Cuban angle.

Within hours of President Kenne-
dy’s death, the U.S. embassy cabled in-
formation from Mexico City suggest-
ing that the Cubans may have been be-
hind the assassination. Our sources say
that the CIA developed similar infor-
mation in Washington.

The first person to reach Robert
Kennedy's side after the shooting was
CIA Director John A. McCone, who re-
mained alone with the Attorney Gen-
eral at his McLean, Va. home for
nearly three hours.

McCone swore to us that Castro’s
name was never mentioned during the
three hours. But CIA records show
that the next day McCone not only
mentioned Castro to the new Presi-
dent, Lyndon B. Johnson, but briefed
him on the information from Mexico

Mafia mobster John Roselli may
have taken the secret of the John F.
Kennedy assassination with him to his
death. He was brutally murdered a
few weeks ago, his backed-up body
stuffed Into an oil drum and dumped
into Miami's Biscayne Bay.

Before he died, Roselli hinted to as-
sociates that he knew who had ar-
ranged President Kennedy's murder.
It was the same conspirators, he sug-
gested, whom he had recruited earlier
to kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.

By Roselli’s cryptic account, Castro
learned the identity of the underworld
contacts in Havana who had been
trying to knock him off. He believed,

. not altogether without basis, that Pres-

ident Kennedy was behind the plot.

The Cuban leader, as the supreme
irony, decided to turn the tables and
use the same crowd to arrange Ken-
nedy’s assassination, according to
Roselli’s scenario. To save their skins,
the plotters lined up Lee Harvey Os-
wald to pull the trigger.

Roselli could never be pinned down
‘On names or details. It was also diffi-
cult to assess whether he knew what
he was talking about or whether he
merely described what he thought
might have happened. Certainly there
is no real evidence to support Roselli's
story. But there are enough curious
circumstances to justify telling it. Here

“are the fascinating highlights.

The ruggedly handsome Roselli, a
flamboyant mobster with underworld
contacts in Havana, was recruited by
the Central Intelligence Agency in
1960 to assassinate Castro. He had no

, authority, however, over the under-

world elements in Havana.

Behind John E :

They were under the loose control
of Florida’s Mafia chieftan, Santos
Trafficante. His gambling enterprises
in Havana had been closed down by
Castro after the 1959 revolution. In
fact, Trafficante had been lodged for a
period in a Cuban jail, an indignity
that didn't endear Castro to him.

After Trafficante made it back to bis

» Florida haunts, he left part of his or-
ganization behind in Havana. Some of
his henchmen even managed to de
velop contacts in Castro's inner circle.
These were the people Roselli wanted
to use to knock off Castro.

But Roselli didn't have the stature
inside the Mafia to make the necessary
arrangements with Trafficante. So
Roselli,called in bis patron, the Chi-
cago godfather Sam (Momo) Giancana,
to deal with Trafficante.

As Roselli's associates tell it, he per-
suaded'Giancana that it would be to
their advantage to win the good will of
the CIA. Convinced, Giancana flew
down to Florida to make the prelimi-
nary arrangements.

Once Giancana and Trafficante set it
up, Roselli used the Havana under-
world to plot Castro's demise. At first,
they tried to plant poison Pills, sup-
plied by the CIA, in Castro's food. The
pills would have made it appear that
he died- of natural causes. When this
failed, snipers were dispatched to a
Havana rooftop. They were caught,

The word reached Roselli that some
of the plotters had been tortured and
that Castro had learned about the
whole operation.

The CIA called off the Roselli opera- |

tion in March, 1963, but recruited a
Castro associate, Rolando Cubela, to
murder Castro,

THE WASHINGTON POST Friday, August 27, 1976

‘ Jack Anderson and Les Whitten::- '-

Smudge Only Clue in

It was a grisly end for John Rosselli,
the dapper, debonair mobster about
town, who had been a familiar figure
in the glittering night spots of Holly-
wood, Las Vegas and Havana.

His killers shot or stabbed him in the
stomach. The autopsy indicates they
may have shot him and then dug out

> the bullet with a knife. Then they bru-

"details of his death
searched for his killers. We began our ©

tally hacked off his legs. It is possible

that he was still alive when they.

stuffed his body into a 5S-gallon drum.

They wrapped chains around the
drum to weight it down and tossed it
into Biscayne Bay. The autopsy sug-
gests he may have died of asphyxiation
inside the drum before it hit the wa-
ter. The gases from the decomposing
body floated the heavy container to
the surface. It was discovered, with its

| Rigbtmarish contents, 10 days after
Rosselli had disappeared from his

er’s home in Plantation, Fla.
The police withheld the gruesome
while they

own investigation, meanwhile, after an
appeal from his associates.

‘We first encountered Johnny Ros-
selli more than five years ago, We
were investigating his role in the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency's plot to assas-
sinate Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.

‘The CIA case officer, William Harv-
ey, told us that Rosselli had been the
hero of the abortive adventure.
Harvey broke his oath of secrecy be-
cause he thought it might help Rossel-
li, who was in trouble with the law.
The CLA agent had nothing but praise
for Rosselli’s daring.

In the strictest of confidence, Ros-

. selli himself confirmed that he had di-

DocId:32423630

rected six assassination attempts
against Castro. We protected his con-

Page 454

fidence, so he came to trust us. We

were the only reporters he would talk

to.

, So when he vanished last month his

associates came to us for help. We

were suspicious, of course, that his dis-

appearance was linked to the Castro»
caper. But our investigation has now.
produced evidence to the contrary.

‘We have learned, for example, that
Rosselli was not the amiable, retired
old duffer he pretended to be. He be-
gan in the big time as a bookkeeper for
Chicago's notorious Al Capone and be-
came a specialist in white-collar
crimes. It's a profession, apparently,
that he never gave up.

'’ Competent sources say that, be-
tween rounds on the Florida golf
courses, Rosselli was involved in stolen
securities and financial swindles. His

peice
Rosselli Case ;

! gave’ information, according ‘to our
sources, which resulted in a grand jury
confrontation for Tony Accardo. The
surly mobster took the fifth. But Ac-
cardo grumbled to associates that he.
would pay back Rosselli some day. -”

Rosselli was also blamed for passing +
information to the government, which !

» led to the conviction of Detroit mob j

ster Anthony Zerilli. He is now serving
a four-year séntence at Sandstone fed- i
eral penitentiary for racketeering. i

Perhaps the last straw was Rosselli's |
testimony in the Castro case. He identi-
fled two mobsters, the late Sam Gian- ;
cana and Santo Trafficante, as being '
involved in the assassination attempts. '
It's no secret in the underworld that
‘Trafficante detests publicity.

Castro Plot Raises J

By Jack (dndersan

The plot to kill Cuban dic-
tator Fidel Castro, hidden for
10 years from the publle, raises
some ugly questions that high
officials would rather keep;
buried deep inside the Central
Intelligence Agency.

1. Has the CIA tried to as-
sassinate any other leaders?
John McCone, who headed the
CIA during the six attempts
to knock off Castro, denied
emphatically that the CIA has
tried to kill anyone. But ex-
Sen. George Smathers, one of
‘John F. Kennedy's closest:
friends, told us the late Presi-
dent suspected that the CIA
had arranged the shootings of
the Dominican Republic's Ra-
jfael Trujillo in 1961 and South
'Vietnam’s Ngo Dinh Diem in
1963,
| 2. Did President Kennedy!
personally. sanction the plot|
jagainst Castro? The prepara-
‘rations to assassinate the Cu-
‘ban dictator began during the
last months of the Eisenhower
‘administration as part of the:
Bay of Pigs scheme, All six
altempts, however, were made
during 1961-63 when Me, Ken-
nedy occupied the White
House. Smathers told us he
jonce spoke to the late Presi-
dent about assassinating Cas-
‘tro. Mr. Kennedy merely
‘rolled back his eyes, recalled
Smathers, as if to indicate the
Hidea was too wild to discuss.
Subsequently, Mr. Kennedy
told Smathers of his suspicion
that the CIA may have been

behind the Teulilto and Diem
assassinations.

3. Did the late Robert Ken-
nedy know about the assassina-|
tlon attempts? After the Bay|
of Pigs fiasco, President Ken-|
nedy swore to friends he
would like “to splinter the CIA
in a thousand pieces and scat-
ter it-to the winds.” He put
his brother, Robert, in charge
of the CIA with instructions)
to shake it up, The CIA made
five attempts on Castro’s life
after the Bay of Pigs while
Robert Kennedy was riding|
herd on the agency.

4. Could the plot against
(Castro have backfired against}
President Kennedy? The lata
President was murdered nine
months after the last assassi-|
ination team was caught on a’
Havana rooftop with high.
powered rifles. Presumably,
they were subjected to fiend.
ish tortures until they told all
they knew. None of the assas-|
sination teams,- however, had
direct knowledge of the CIA!
involvement. The CIA insti.
gators had represented them-
selves as oilmen seeking re-
venge against Castro for his
seizure of oil holdings.

PLOT BACKFIRE?

Former associates recall
that Robert Kennedy, dee
ly despondent, went into se
seclusion after, his brother's;
assassination. Could he have}
been tormented by more than
natural grief? He certainly
learned that the assassin, Lee
Harvey Oswald, had been ac-
tive in the pro-Castro move-

thought that the CIA plot,|
which he must at least have’
condoned, put. into motion}
forces that may have brought
about “his brother's martyr}
dom? cs

The last surviving brother,
‘Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass)
could give us no Insight. His
brothers had never spoken to!
him about any asgassination
attempts against Castro, he
said. He was aware, he volun-
teered, only that Sen. Smath-
ers had talked to the late
President about eliminating
Castro.

Smathers told us that Pres!-
dent Kennedy seemed “horri-
fied" at the dpa ‘af political’
assassination /'}| ‘remember
him saying,’) recalled Smath-
ers, “that tl fe CIA frequently
did things he didn’t know!
about, and he was unhappy
bout It. He complained that
the CIA was almost autono-|
mous.

“He told me he believed the
CIA had arranged to have
Diem and Trujillo bumped off.
He was pretty well shocked
about that. He thought it was
a stupid thing to do, and he
wanted to get control of what

ithe CLA was doing.”

But McCone, disagreeing
vigorously, told us that “no
plot was authorized or imple-|
mented” to assassinate Castro, |
Trujillo, Diem or anyone else.

“During those days of ten-

sion, there was a wide spec-
trum of plans ranging from
one extreme to another,”
McCone admitted. “Whenever
this subject (assassinating Cas-
tro) was brought up—and it
was — it was rejected inane.
diately on two grounds. Firét,
it would not be condoned: By
anybody. Second, it wouldn’t
have achleved anything.”

There was also talk in high
places, McCone acknowledged,
of supporting a coup to oust
Diem. The former CIA dl-
rector sald he hed argued
against ¢his at a secret session
with both Kennedy brothers.
He had contended that there
was no one strong enough to
take Diem’s place and that a
coup, therefore, would bring
“political upheaval.”

“I told the President and
Bobby together,” recalled Mc-
Cone, “that if I were running
a baseball team and had only
one pitcher, I wouldn't take
him out of the game.” z

‘The November, 1963, coup
caught the United States com-
pletely by surprise, he sald.
While the plotters were mov-
ing on the palace, he said,
then-Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge was visiting Diem.
Adm. Ulysses Sharp, then our
Pacific commander, had also
been present, but had left
early to go to the airport.

McCone said President
Diem escaped through a tun-
nel but was caught in nearby
Cholon and “shot in a station
wagon.

. the CLA. in a scheme to dispatch
Fidel Castro have now both been’ mur-
dered after discussing their C.LA. en-
terprise with the United States Senate,
and the police have pronounced: the
incidents “gangland-style killings.”
The phrase “gangland-style killing”
has the cozy resonance of “home-style
cooking,” perhaps because both sug-
gest the Intimacy of hearth and fire

round and nobody else welcome, Jack.
These family affairs are, of course,
meddled into by the constabulary, but
rarely with much enthusiasm. !
This may be because police success
at nabbing perpetrators of “gangland-
style killings” has never been such as
to get them into the world series of
detection, with the result that inces-
Sant failure may have dulled: their
Appetite for. the hunt. ;

Or, it may be because policemen
believe the subjects of “gangland-style
Killings” aren't worth working over-
time for. I don't know, ard I certainly
don’t mean. to impute either languor,
timidity or indifference to America’s
homicide ‘squads. I simply ‘point out
that once a murder has been called
“gangland-style,” apprehension of ‘the

occur,

This raises the. question’ whether
“gangland-style” murders might pos-
sibly be catchirg among people who
don’t come from’ gangland. Consider
the Roselli case. The body is found’ in
the customary barrel, with the cus-
tomary weights, in ‘the. customary

gangland seems to leave an open-and-
shut case, which the police will quietly
shut as soon as possible.

Cuban Link to JFK Death

By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern
‘Washington Post Statt Writers

Long before his recent murder,
John Rosselli, the CIA’s underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in retall-
ation, were involved in the assassifa-
tion of President John F. Kennedy,

Rosselli’s belief in a Cuban connec.
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long
ago as March, 1967, and also in private
conversations with a longtime associ-
ate of Rosselli who participated in
meetings between Rosselli and the
CIA. :

Chief Justice of the United
States’ Earl Warren late in’ January,
1967, and told him that a Washington
lawyer had confided to him that one
of his clients said the United States
“had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro
had decided to retaliate.”

Warren declined Pearson's sugges:

Edward Morgan. Warren referred the
matter to then Secret Service Direc:

1967, wrote FBI Direc!

Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an “eyes:

meetings or discussions of. those alle-
gations. At that point the sensitive let-
fer bounced back and forth in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-

letter was assigned to the supervisor
of the FBI's General Investigative Di-

CIA, regarding interrogation of witnesses concerning
Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City. We are,
however, furnishing a copy of an FBI to CIA teletype
dated November 27, 1963, captioned "Lee Harvey Oswald,"
which advises that the interrogation of Oswald between
his arrest and murder had not extended to his travel to
Mexico or his contacts with Soviet establishments. The
teletype, classified "Secret," also contains details
from an Oswald letter to the Soviet Embassy,
Washington, D. C., which were obtained from a highly
sensitive source.

MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Sabotage against Castro

Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the
Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine con-
tinuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish

to review. The three operations involved are:

{1) a commando sabotage operation against a coastal
warehouse and pier;

(2) a sabotage attack against naval or patrol vessels in
a harbor; and

(3) a sabotage operation against a fuel barge proceeding
in coastal waters,

All of these operations would:have been approved three months ago,
and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted
because of high seas. While itis always hard to predict the noise
level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the
small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which occurred in late December
which Castro promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation

approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it rea
seemed to fall within the guidance you expressedin your first review
\ ——<—<—<—<—<——

of the Cuban problem). \

The policy question now is this: If we continue these even small
sabotage operations, Castro will certainly know it. Equally,jif we
call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians.’ Wel thus
have an opportunity to choose. a

I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone.
I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle
of covert sabotage against Cuba. I know that Rusk has never liked it
and that McNamara thinks it does very little good. McCone and the CIA
are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the

\ Castro problem. I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced,

but before hearing full argument, my guess is that in your position
I would stop sabotage attacks on the ground that they are illegal,
ineffective, and damaging to our broader policy. I might then wish
to make a little capital from this decision with the Soviet Union.

DATE: January 27, 1976
SUBJ: Connection Between Amlash Operation and Investigation
of JFK Assassination
Background aH

The staff's memorandum of January 5, 1976, postulated that the
Amlash operation might have had some effect on CIA's response to
the investigation of President Kennedy's assassination. On January
9, 1976, the staff dsked for access to the Amlash file at CIA; and
after a delay which was not explained, the staff was permitted to
review the file on January 23 and 26.

y Summary of Amlash File : .

Amlash initially contacted by CIA in 1961 met occasionally with
case officers through August 1962, at which time he was given instruc-
tion in secret writing and explosives. Interest in Amlash continued
after the August meetings, but there was no further direct contact by CIA
agents until mid-1963. Why there was a year lapse in contact with Am-
lash cannot be determined; the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962
undoubtedly made CIA cautious in dealing with Amlash.

*

In any event, DIR 48198 to Rome of 19 June 1963 states that
Amwhip, a Cuban exile who assisted CIA, had sent a letter as part of
an “activation effort to reluctant dragon." Presumably, Amlash was
“reluctant dragon" and was,:by this letter, asked to recontact CIA.

In late August, Amlash traveled with a large contingent of Cuban
officials and athletes to Porto Alegre, Brazil. He cabled Amwhip
about his arrival on August 29. This cable apparently was the signal
that he was prepared to meet Amwhip in Porto Alegre.

Amwhip and two CIA case officers met with Amlash in Porto Alegre
between September 5 and 8. The two case officers have testified to
the Committee about their understanding of events at this series of
meetings which they viewed essentially as a get acquainted session.
CIA-messages tell a different story. Porto Alegre 0704 to DIR 6f 7
September stated that Amlash told Amwhip he felt’ there were only two
ways of getting rid of Castro. The first was an invasion by U.S.
forces which Amlash knew was out of the question and the second was
an "inside job." Amlash indicated he was awaiting a U.S. plan of action.
He referred to the explosives demonstration CIA gave him a year earlier
as "too cumbersome" for his purposes.

At the conclusion of the meetings with Amlash, Headquarters
cabled on 9 September that, based on what little feel Headquarters
had, Amlash appeared hopeless as an intelligence performer and should
be approached as a chief conspirator allowed to recruit his own co-
horts. He should be urged to recruit a few trusted friends to assist
him, initially in "FI and Ops reporting" and then progress to sabotage
and more serious matters on an orderly basis. (DIR 67110 to Porto
Alegre, JMNAVE and Rio.)

On 11 September, Porto Alegre 0708 to DIR summarized the intel-
ligence information Amlash had given on Soviet units in Cuba, saying
“all IRBM and bombers had been removed. By this time Amlash had left
Brazil apparently heading for a vacation in Europe. -{

A document in the file dated 16 September and marked OFPA 72775
appears to be a transcript of a conversation obtained by covert means.
There is no indication as to where the conversation takes place, but
it probably is in the Cuban Embassy in -Paris.

ava "Mary: I don't want. to imagine things but
this thing of Amlash. :
Moreno: It is either a tremendous secret ora x.
top secret matter (unreadable) then the
word "treason" or "reason").

Betty: I believe it is a top-secret matter."

By letters of September 14 and September 16, Amlash. stayed in
contact with Amwhip. Paris station apparently was picking up responsi-
bility for Amlash at this © time, since Paris 0706 to DIR dated 19 ©
September asks for some background material on Amlash.

On 19 September, JMWAVE 4580 to DIR warns that Amlash is part of
an anti-communist group in Cuba and details the membership of his group
as well as a communist group. The message also notes that Fidel is
allegedly aware of the two groups and acts as moderator between them
in order to maintain cohesion in the Government of Cuba.

Nevertheless, Amwhip is asked to continue to work with Amlash
and is assigned to accompany him around Europe. According to Paris
0934 to DIR dated 7 October, Amlash met with case officer O* on 5
October. Case officer 9 sat and listened permitting Amlash to get
everything off his chest. Amlash seemed to be complaining about the
low level espionage matters that had been discussed at the September
meeting in Brazil, implying he had a more valuable role. Case officer
0 "provided necessary assurances his feelings not in fact true and
that his case receiving consideration highest levels. (emphasis added)''"
“With this problem which had undoubtedly been bothering Amlash con-_ i

siderably, off his chest, a much more relaxed Amlash departed restating
his desire return Cuba to undertake 'the big job.t"

On October 15, London 5224 to DIR states case officer 0 met with
Amlash and Amwhip on 13 October. Although. the case officer had been
forewarned by Amwhip, he was not successful in discouraging Amlash's
request for a high level meeting. '"Amlash convinced that if such meet
does not take place at this time it will be almost impossible come out
again and we will be in same situation as last year with no definite
decision. Also finds it difficult to believe why RFK who receives many
Cubans would refuse to see a major" such'as Amlash. The message notes
the fact remains that Amlash does "have excellent entree to highest
target level which believe we cannot afford overlook." i

This message seemingly moved Headquarters to re-evaluate Amlash's
role. DIR 75683 to London on 15 October directed case officer 0 to
return headquarters soonest for discussions of all phases of the case.

The next meeting apparently took place on October 29. One case
officer met Amlash holding himself out as the personal representative
of RFK. He informed Amlash, according to a 13 November MFR, that
the U.S. was prepared to render all necessary assistance to any anti-
communist Cuban group which succeeded in neutralizing the present Cuban
leadership and which assumed significant control to invite the U.S.
to render assistance. He emphasized that U.S: support could come only
after a successful coup. Amlash responded by saying that without Fidel,
the military would break up into 4 or 5 groups and the regime would
disintegrate. He also said he was satisfied with the policy discussion
but desired to know what technical support he could get.

Since Amwhip was closer to Amlash than the case officers, he was
asked about Amlash's reaction to the meeting. His reactions are
summarized in Attachment A to Amwhip's Memo of Meeting dated 14 Novem-
ber. Amwhip said Amlash was still not pleased with support from U.S.
government. While Amlash was satisfied on policy grounds, he was not
at all happy with the fact that he still was not given the technical
assistance for the operation plan as he saw it. Amlash could not under-
stand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised
a final solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the U.S. gave
much equipment and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions
against Cuban coastal targets. Amlash had accepted the fact he had to
work with the CIA, but CIA might lose him if it continued to procrastin-,

~——“ate. “Amlash talked about going to the Trench térrorist organization,
the OAS, but realized that was not feasible. The memorandum ends with
what apparently is the author's conclusion: “It is hoped that he does
realize that Havana.must first be taken. . ..or failing that, a
truly sizeable piece of land (say, almost an entire province) which
could be true rallying point."

In a Memo for Record dated 19 November, one case officer summarized
the actions to be taken at the next meeting with Amlash. Amlash was to
be told the U.S. was prepared to give full support to Amlash's coup.

He would be shown President Kennedy's speech in Miami of November 18
and told this reaffirmed support for Amlash's proposal. Headquarters
had approved giving Amlash scopes and rifles and other equipment. The
memo ended by stating that "C/SAS* requested written reports on Amlash
operation be kept to a minimum."

Pari 1564 to DIR of 20 November indicated Amlash had been called
on the night of November 20 and had agreed to postpone his return to
Cuba in order to see case officer 0 “if it something interesting." The
CIA officer said he could not assure it was interesting but -that it was
to be a meeting which Amlash had requested. (Obviously, CIA wanted to
give Amlash the "technical support" he felt he had not been promised in
the 29 October meeting.)

Case officer O flew from the U.S. so as to arrive in Paris on the morn-
ing of November 22 for this meeting.

Pari 1607 to DIR received at Langley at 6:25 a.m. on 23 November
is the only message in Amlash's file reflecting the fact the meeting
had taken place. It indicated that Amlash was anxious to return to
Cuba and that case officer 0 was to arrive in Washington at 1810 that

day.

The file contains no outgoing cable to Paris on November 23 or
any other time telling Paris to break contact with Amlash.**

On 25 November, a contact report was prepared. There is reason
to question the authenticity of this document which is three pages
and reports the 22 November meeting with Amlash. The first two pages
have dark type as though prepared on a typewriter with a new ribbon.
The type on the third page is much lighter as though prepared on a
typewriter with an old ribbon. Itimade no mention of the passing
Qf a poison pen to Amlash.

On November 27, Pari 1669 to DIR reports information obtained
in October possibly by clandestinely listening devices. A source com-
plained bitterly about official (Cuban) visitors to Paris and how they
denigrate the revolution.. The source said she wished she had a con-
cealed tape recorder to record these conversations, She named Amlash
as.one of these visitors.

* Desmond Fitzgerald

*k In its 1967 report, the IG stated such a message had been sent
but could not be found.

NW-50955— Docld:32423630— Page 478— ——— ~~


On 3 December, Headquarters furnished JMWAVE some details on the
Amlash meeting including the fact that he had been promised "full U.S.
support if he is successful in a real coup against the Castro regime."
He was also promised arms which will have to be furnished through
JMWAVE's operations.

A series of confusing cables passed between Headquarters and JMWAVE
on December 6, 7, and 8. Apparently, Headquarters first gave JMWAVE
authority to drop a cache of arms in Cuba. Then Headquarters called
off the operation. In DIR 87615 of 7 December, it is noted “major
top level Cuban/Caribbean policy review scheduled early next week which
should provide basis: for decision." a

JMWAVE complained about the change in orders in a cable of 8
December. JMWAVE 8702 pointed out that one Headquarter's message
indicated December infiltration operations were approved by higher. author-
ity but a second message indicated a scheduled operation should be de-
layed and not run in December.

if
f
cee aa

Headquarters responded in DIR 87880. Headquarters procedure
was to present infiltration operation plans to “higher authority"
even though there is a reasonable chance operation may be postponed
or delayed as. was case with the scheduled operation. "This procedure
will secure approval for the operation with only telephonic reconfirma-
tion needed when previously relaxed. operation finally mounted." Head-
quarters recommended delay until January after considering and equating
objectives against risk factors for Amlash and others. "Believe by
January, CIA should be in position better evaluate status of internal
assets."

By Pari 1914 of 13 December, Paris reported that Amlash left
Paris for Prague on November 27 but did not seek recontact with case
officer. DIR 90966 to JMWAVE of 23 December reported that Havana radio
on 2 December stated Amlash arrived Cuba on 1 December.

The last document in Amlash's file for the period ending December
1963, is a long report on Amlash, but it does not contain information
relevant to the October-November activities. Nevertheless, in red pen
on the cover page appears: "Dec 1963 Not to leave this office on Nestor's
(Sanchez) orders."' followed by initials that appear to be "GM."

One later document in the Amlash file contains’ more information
about the November 22, 1963 meeting. That document, a rough draft of
a biographical information sheet on Amlash (no final draft was found)
appears to have been prepared!in 1966 at the time of Amlash's arrest
for a later plot against Castro. It states: "22 Nov. 63 Mr. Fitzgerald
and Mr. Sanchez assured subject that this Agency would give him every-
thing he needed. (telescopic sight, silencer, all the money he wanted).
The situation changed when Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Fitzgerald left the meet-
ing to discover that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Because
of this fact, plans with subject changed and it was decided that this

NT au
ALA |)

HW 50955 -DocId:32423630 Page 479


Agency could have no part in the assassination of a government leader
(including Castro) and it-would not aid subject in his attempt. This
included the following. "We would not furnish the silencer, nor scope
nor any money for direct assassination; furthermore, we would not lift
a finger to help subject escape from Cuba should he assassinate Castro."

The same document states this message was communicated to Amlash
in November 1964 by Mr. Sanchez.

Despite this decision, the CIA in fact continued to assist Amlash
through a cut-out until Amlash's arrest in 1966.

Later documents. on Amlash are also relevant to, the September-
November 1963 Amlash operation. Several such documents report informa-
tion received to the effect that Fidel Castro had long been aware of
Amlash's plots against him.. For example, Amlash's one time Cuban
mistress was believed to be working for Cuban intelligence and her
brother was known to be with Cuban intelligence. Pari 8242 to DIR
in December 1964 warns that Amlash's objective may be known to too
many Cubans. And, one CIA informant reported in. 1966 on one known
double agent of Cuban intelligence working for CIA-and said the CIA's
Cuban operations had been penetrated at a high level by Cuban intel-
ligence. He identified this latter individual only as one of the Cuban

exiles who was knowledgeable-of a number of the most important opera-
tions. Nevertheless, Amlash's file contains nothing to indicate any
detailed analysis of these possible penetrations of. the CIA's Amlash
operation, although a cryptic handwritten note on at least one re-

port rejects the suggestion that Amlash was himself reporting to Castro.

One other document bears on the testimony Amlash's case officers
gave before the Select Committee to the effect that Amlash was given
a poison pen for self-protection. That document reports that Amlash,
and other Cuban officials in Paris in 1963, were carrying pistols for
self-protection throughout their travel in Europe.

Finally, although the staff has not reviewed all possible CIA
files to determine what other operations Castro might have been re=
ferring to in his September 7 statement, the Amlash file indicates
that some coastal landings of supplies in August were the only other
CIA operations conducted against Cuba in this time period.

Scenario for B-9

yy

This doctrine is based on the proposition that
the decision hag been reached that the U.S. cannot live
with a Castro/communist regime in Cuba which continues
its present course of subversion and aggression in Latin
America and that we. are determined to take appropriate
action to put an end to these acts.

1. In the Venezuelan arms cache case now before
the OAS hold out for a "blank check" resolution. Settle
for a 13 vote majority regardless of Mexican, Brazilian,
or Chilean support. 5

2. If, despite 1. above, OAS waters down resolu-
tion, vote against the watered-down version.

3. If "blank check" resolution passed, proceed
to 5. below.

4, If watered-down resolution passed over our
protest, announce publicly that OAS no longer represents
an adequate hemispheric safeguard and therefore that the
United States must unilaterally declare (see 5. below),

5. Declare publicly that further aggression and
subversion by Castro in Latin America would be intolerable

to the United States and, in the event of a new act on the

part of Castro of the nature and magnitude of the Venezuelan

er)

C arms cache, the U.3. will take such measures against
the Castro/communist regine in Cuba as it deems appro-
priate in the circumstances.

6.. Explain carefully through diplomatic

channels to the Soviet Union that the United States
finds the present behavior of the Castro/comunist
regime in Cuba intolerable, that Cuba's activities in
Venezuela prove this to ‘be 80 and that further acts
of violence of comparable danger or potential danger
on the part of Cuba will cause the U.S. to feel no
longer bound by any inhibitions against invasion or
other appropriate action. Urge the Soviet Union, in

cr order to reduce tensions in the Caribbean and permit
the U.S, to live peacefully with the Castro/communist
regime in Cuba, to assure that Cuba is restrained
from repeating its dangerous practices, Make it plain
to the Soviet Union that further behavior of this sort
by Castro will compel the U.S. to adopt drastic measures.
Point out to the Soviet ignion the physical vulnerability
of Cuba as well as the effect a failure to resolve the
Cuban problem will have lon the traditional policy which
the U.S. has pursued of not exerting pressures upon the
Soviets! European satellites. Make it plain that the U.S.

desires peace in the Caribbean and expects the Soviet

Union to achieve good behavior on the part of Castro,

7. Decide upon ths type of action on the part
of Castro which would trigger action on the part of the
U.S. A rule of thumb could be: such action as would
represent serious, realized or potential, danger to the
stability of a Latin American state, By this criterion

- 20 Castro-trained men and four tons of arms introduced
into northeast Brazil might not constitute a trigger,
whereas the same effort by Castro in a Central American
country might. The judgment can be unilateral and
subjective on the part of the U.3.

8. Formulate a program for a post-Castro Cuba
giving full weight to the real changes which have taken

c place there during the past five years and. full recog-
nition to the need for channeling Castro's unfinished
revolution into constructive lines.

The above scenario should not be commenced unlesa
it is recognized that, although these actions are
primarily designed to deter Castro from his present course,

SPECTRUM OF COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO CUBA

Accepting as valid the Attorney General's statement
that there is no point in discussing courses of action
with respect to Cuba until the fundamental decision is
made as to whether or not it is possible for the United
States to live with Castro, the following possible
courses of action are listed under the headings "Can
Live with Castro” and "Can't Live with Castro." Neither
of these headings is absolute; the courses of action
listed under each are indicative of degrees of accepta-
bility of the Castro regime or conversely the urgency
to overthrow it.

COURSES OF ACTION

A. Can Live with Castro

1. Negotiate a detente with Fidel looking towards
full recognition of nis regime and unlinited trade
between the United States and Cuba. The negotiator of
the detente would endeavor fo Secure from Castro. com
mitments not to engage in subversive activities in
Latin America and not to engage in polemics against
the United States. He would also endeavor to reduce
or eliminate, as a result of our concessions, Soviet
presence in Cuba and reduce the Cuban military machine
to one compatible with the requirements of a peaceful
Latin American island republic.

No covert activities would be undertaken and
intelligence operations would be of a nature compat~
ible with our relations with a neutral power.

operations would not include black maritime operations
into Cuba. It would be hoped that Fidel, recognizing

REVIEW OF CURRENT PROGRAM OF
COVERT ACTION ACAINST CUBA

I. = The Current Situation in Cuba

‘During 1963 the situation in Cuba steadily worzencd. Tha
economy continued its decline and Castro was not able to halt:
the dovnward curve. Hurricana Flora intensified Cuba's esononia
probleas. Disiliusiomment and apathy among tha great majority a
of ths population contimed to grow, and enthusiasa was increasingly |
restricted to a hard cove. Aa popular support waned, coercion and
terror pre7e exployed more and more to maintain the rezine's control.
Castro's driva to convert Cuba into @ standard commnist prototype
caused increasing disillusionment among his original followers.

His stature in the eyes of many Cubans and Latin Americans suffered .
with tho xealicatica, da the aftermath of the October missile cristae,
that Cuba had oeen a pawn Sad Castro a cupe of Soviat policy.

Despite extraordinary efforts, Castro haa not been able to:
step acta of defiance against his regime. Guerrilla activity,
although scattered and encoordinated, continues. Spontaneous penn
acts of sabotage are cécmon throushout the island. At creat ite
risk refugees still elude bis security forces and sca patrols :
to escape from Cuba. In this atcosphere, externally counted

’ gadds against Cuban targets bave added to Castro's sense of
frustration and helped sustain hope among the many Cutans dis-
Allusioned with bis regime.

During 1963 Cuba's international situation seened almost as
bad as the domestic. Although chinks appeared in the wall, the
U.S. policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Cuba vas
holding ep fairly well. Soviet-Cuban relations clearly vere tuder
strain, Castro scared no foreign polley victories to provida a
much needed psychological boost. His major effort to stimilate
Castro-type armed uprisings throughout Latin America failed to
disrupt the Venezuelan elections of DecemSer and netted a potentially “
embarrassing exposure that Cuba had shipped arms clandestinely to
Venezuela, These internal and international trends and davelop- =)
ments’ brought Cuba to a lew point during 1563. attr

within the regime, particulariy in the arsed forces, to carry
ous a coup. The objective of the coup would be to remove

4s enzzged in a race against tine with Cubs and its Soviet
ally to obstruct the cansulidation o£ Castro's regine at hogs
and to provent bis from achieving his ecbitions in Latin
éaeric2, we set the tine fr. for this program at about
eighteen menths from Jue 1363. :

Az originally. conceived and approved in June 1963, the
covert action program was based on the assumption that U.S.
policy precludes a military invesion or a full blockade of
‘. Guba which could lead to a confrontation with the Soviet Unt
“In addition, the covert action program was and is predicated
on the thesis that its chance of success would depend heavily
oa @ sustaine and intensive effort in other sectors, parti<-
eularly the overt ccomonic denial and political isalation

« Theg, the inter-ection of the overt and covert effort against
Cuba is regarded as a vital ard irreplaceable factor if there
is to be any bepe of accomplishing the overall mission.” oi

would involve. Even if the recommendations are adopted
completely, we could hava no real assurance that our attemits

tive.” Second question; What does the American gov-
ernment expect to gain from the blockade? [s the
economic isolation of Cuba a punishment or a political
maneuver?

Kennedy's reply: “Are you suggesting that the polit-
ical effectiveness of the blockade is uncertain [simile]?
You will see when you go to Cuba whether it is or not.
In any case, we can’t let Communist subversion win in
the other Latin American countries. Two dikes are
needed to contain Soviet expansion: the blockade on
the one hand, a tremendous effort toward progress on
the other. This is the problem in a nutshell. Both battles
are equally difficult.” (Silerice.) Then, a last comment:
“The continuation of the blockade depends on the con-
tinuation of subversive activities.”

The interview was over, I did not really wish to su
gest anything, since I had never been to Cuba and,
on the other hand, I had heard from all sides tales of
the privations the Cuban people were suffering owing
to their isolated economic situation. But [ could see
plainly that John Kennedy had doubts, and was secking
away out.

That same evening I recounted this conversation in
detail to an American colleague - an intimate friend of
President Kennedy, through whom I had obtained this
interview ~and to the editor of The New Republic.
Both my confidants, who knew the President a thou-
sand times better than I, agreed that John F. Kennedy
had never before expressed hisrteaifiso specifically and
with such feeling on his understanding of the first
phase of the Castro revolution. They hesitated to draw
any political conclusions from his remarks. However,
they were not surprised at Kennedy's invitation to
come and see him again when I returned from Cuba

In effect, John Kennedy displayed two basic charac-
teristics in his exercise of power: first, an overwhelming
degree of empiricism and realism. A man without a
particular doctrine, he reacted decisively to events, and
only to events. Nothing but the shock of collision with
a problem was sufficient to make him come to a deci-
sion, and because of this, his decisions were unpredic-
table. At, that point he had a consuming need for
information, and this need had increased a great deal
since experience had taught him not to rely solely on
official channels.

interview with lent. We went up to my
Foom at to in the evening and did not leave until 4 in
the following morning. Here, I shall only recount that
part of that interview which constiiutes a reply to John
E. Kennedy's remarks.

Fidel listened with devouring and passionate inter-
est: he pulled at his beard, yanked his parachutist’s
beret down over his eyes, adjusted his maqui tunic, all
the while making me the target of a thousand maliciot.»
sparks cast by his deep-sunk, lively eyes. At one poirit
I felt as though I were playing the role of that partner
with whom he had as strong a desire to confer as to do
battle; as though I] myself were in a small way that
intimate enemy in the White House whom Khrushchev
described to Fidel as someone with whom it is pos-
sible to talk.” Three times he had me repeat certain re-
marks, particularly those in which Kennedy expressed
his criticism of the Batista regime, those in which Ken-
nedy showed his impatience with the comments attrib-
uted to General.de Gaulle, and lastly those in which
Kennedy accused Fidel of having almost caused a war
fatal to all humanity.

When I stopped talking, I expected an explosion.
Instead, I was treated to a lengthy silence. and, at-the
end of that silence, to a calm, composed, often humor-
ous, always thoughtful exposition. I don’t know wheth-
er Fidel has changed, or whether these cartoons cari-
caturing him as a ranting madman which appear in the
Western press perhaps correspond to'a former reality.
T only know that at no time during the two complete
days I spent with him (and during which a great deal
happened), did Castro abandon his composure and
poise. Here too, I shall let Castro speak for himself,
reserving only the possibility of correcting certain judg-
ments on these two political leaders based on my own
experiences in Cuba.

“T believe Kennedy is sincere,” Fidel declared. “I
also believe that today the expression of tis sincerity
could have’ political significance. T'll explain what I
mean. I_haven’t forgotten that Kennedy contoredubis

Before, Tong before there was the pretext and alibi_of
Communisy. But I feel that he inherited a difficult

situation; I don’t think a President of the United States
is ever really free, and I believe Kennedy is at present
feeling the impact of this lack of freedom, I also believe
he now understands the extent to which he has been
misled, especially, for example, on Cuban reaction at
the time of the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion. I also,
think bois realists he is now registering that it Tim
possible to simply wave a wand and cause us, and the
explosive situation. throughout Latin America, to dis-

appear.

Why the Missiles Were Installed

‘There is one point on which I want to give you new
information. right away. I have refrained from doing
this until now; but today an attempt is being made to
frighten all mankind by propagating the idea that
Cuba, and in particular I, might provoke a nuclear war,

Adzhubei, came to pay us a visit before going on to
Washington at the invitation of Kennedy's associates.
Immediately upon arriving in Washington, Adzhubei
had been received by the American Chief Executive,
and their talk centered particularly on Cuba: A week
after this interview, we received in Havana a copy of
Adzhubei’s report to Khrushchev. It was this report
which triggered the whole situation.

to realize this objective? All our thinking and discus-
sions revolved around this point. We thought of a
proclamation, an alliance, conventional military aid.
The Russians explained to us that their concern was
twofold: first, they wanted to save the Cuban revolu-
tion (in other words, their socialist honor in the cyes
of the world), and at the ‘same time they wished to
avoid a world conflict. They reasoned that if conven-
tional military aid was the extent of their assistance,
the United States might not hesitate to insti
invasion, in which case Russia would retaliate and th:
would inevitably touch off a world war.”

“I know,” Castro replied, “but the two situations

“Russia was much too deeply committed to us, More-
over, since then we have had every proof of the im-
mense. solidarity of the Soviet people and its leaders.
You can sée for yourself how clearly this solidarity is
manifest here. Then there is. something else, specifi-
cally apropos of Stalin, When I was in the USSR and
others, outside Russia, were reproaching Khrushchev
for taking a more conciliatory stand#han Stalin toward
the capitalists, Khrushchev confided fo me several ex-
amples, which I will not repeat to you, illustrating the
prudence, even the abdication of Stalin. He told me~
and [ believe him ~ that Stalin would never have em-
placed missiles in Cuba.

“Tt is true that it was said then by other factions
that, the real reason for installing the missiles was
because certain internal problems were driving the Rus-
sians to use us to provoke the United States. | am here
to tell you that the Russians didn’t want and do not
today want war. One only need visit them on their
home territory, watch them at work, share their eco-
nomic concerns, admire their intense efforts to raise the
workers’ standard of living, to understand right av rv
that they are far, very far, From any idea of provocation
or domination. However, Soviet Russia was confronted
by two alternatives: an absolutely inevitable war (be-
cause of their commitments and their position in. the
socialist world), if the Cuban revolution was attacked:
or the risk of a war if the United States, refusing to
retreat before the missiles, would not give up the at-
tempt to destroy Cuba. They chose socialist solidarity
and the risk of war, :

“Under these circumstarices, how could we Cubans
have refused to share the risks taken to save us? It
was, in the final analysis, a question of honor, don‘t
you agree? Don’t you believe that honor plays a role
in politics? You think we are romantics, don’t you?
Perhaps we are. And Why not? In any event, we are
militants. In a word, then, we agreed to the emplace-
ment of the missiles. And I might add here that for us
Cubans it didn’t really make so much difference
whether we died by conventional bombing or a hydro-
gen bomb. Nevertheless, we werG@&e eambling with
the peace of the world. The United States was the one
to jeopardize the peace of mankind by using the threat
of war to stifle revolutions.

“And so in June, 1962, my brother Raoul and Che
Guevara went to Moscow to discuss ways and means
of installing the missiles. The convoy arrived by sea in
three weeks. The United States was able to find out
that weapons were being shipped in, of course; but it
took them tivo months to discover that these weapons
were guided missiles. Two months . . . in other words,
longer than we had calculated. Because, of course, we
were seeking intimidation, not aggression.”

‘Alliance for Progress

The.conversation now turned to the Alliance for T'rog-
ress. “In a way," Castro said, “it was a pood idea, it
marked progress of a sort. Even if it can be said that it
was overdue, timid, conceived on the spur of the
moment, under constraint... despite all that | am will-
ing to‘agreg that the idea ine cnstituted an effort
to adapt to the extraordinarily rapid course of events in
Latin America. Such as, for example, what we read in
‘he papers this morning - did you sce the news? That

tine government! Do you realize what that means? This

vill cause more conimotion on the Sis York stock
exchange than Castroism! The Catholic and military
conservatives of Argentina, the factions most closely
linked with’ American interests! There is talk of na-
tignalization of industries there, of agrarian reform
there... well and good! If the Alliance for Progress
provokes these developments, then it’s not doing so
badly; all these things are consonant with the aspira-
Hons of the people. I can look back to the days of
Eisenhower, or rather of Nixon, and recall the furore
which broke out when the United States and Cuba to-
nether decteed an agrarian reform which was to apply,
mark this well, only to landowners of over 200,000
hectares! Yes, 200,000! Yet the reaction of the trusts
was terrible at that time. Nowadays, in the other Latin
American countries, because the Communist banner is
used as a bogeyman, the reaction of the American
trusts is shrewder. They are going to choose strawmen,
so as to rule indirectly, But there will be difficulties.

“This is: why Kennedy’s-good ideas aren't going. to
yield any results. It is very casy to understand and at
this point he surcly is aware of this because, as I told
you, he is a realist. For years and years American policy
~ not the government, but the trusts and the Pentagon
~ has supported the Latin American oligarchies. All the
prestige, the dollars, and the power was held by a class
which Kennedy himself has described in speaking of
Batista. Suddenly a President arrives on the scene who
tries to support the interests of another class (which
has no access to any of the levers of power) to give the
various Latin American countries the impression that
the United Sates no longer stands behind the dictators,
and so there is no more need to start Castro-type revo-
lutions. What happens then? The trusts see that their
interests are being a little compromised (just barely,
but still compromised); the Pentagon thinks the strate- .
gic bases are in danger; the powerful oligarchies in all
the Latin American countries alert their American
friends; they sabotage the new policy; and in short,
Kennedy has everyone against him. The few liberal or
allegedly liberal presidents who were chosen as instru-
ments of the new policy are swept out of office, like
Bosch in Santo Domingo, or else they are transformed.
Betancourt, for example, was not a Batista; now he
has become one.

“In view of all these things, how can the American
government seriously believe that Cuban subversion is
at the root of explosions taking place all over the
South American continent? In Venezuela, fos,example,
are you familiar with the situation there? Do-You think
the Venezuelans need us to understand what's going
on in their country? Do you think we don’t have
enough problems of our own? Right now [ ask only

and suffering, like the Venezuelan people. But it is up
to’ those nations to decide what they want, and if they
choose other regimes than ours, this

sn’t our business.”
“We Have Always Lived with Daiger

T asked Fidel where is this all going to end? How will
the situation develop? Even if the United States uses
against you what you call the alibi of Communism, it
still remains true thet you have choser Conmueism,
that your economy and your security depend on the
Soviet Union, and that even if you have no ulterior mo-
tives in this. association, still the United States considers
that you are part_of an international strategy, that you
constitute a Soviet base ina world where peace depends
on mutual respect for a tacit division of zones of in-
fluence.

“T don’t want to discuss our ties with the Soviet
Union,” Fidel Castro cut me short. “I find this indecent
We have none but feelings of Fraternity and profound,
total gratitude toward the USSR. The Russians are
making extraordinary efforts on our behalf, efforts
which sometimes cost theni dear. But we have our own
policies which are perhaps not always the same (we
have proved this!) as those of the USSR. I refuse to
dwell on this point, because asking me to say that Tam
not a pawn on the Soviet ches-tmepgLis something like
asking a woman to shout aloud in the public square
that she is not a prostitute.

“Tf the United States, sees the problem as you have
posed it, then you are right, there is no way out. But
who is the loser in the last analysis? They have tried
everything against us, everything, absolutely every-
thing, and we are still alive and getting better day by
day; we are still standing upright, and we plan to cele-
brate with greater festivities than usual, on January 1,
1964, the fifth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution!
The United States’ policy of isolating us economically
is less effective with each passing day; we are incteas-

ing our trade with the rest of the world. Even’ with’

Spain! We have just sold a shipment of 300,000 tons
of sugar to the Spaniards. Far from’ discouraging us,
the blockade is maintaining the revolutionary atmos-
phere we need to stiffen the country’s backbone. Are we
in danger? We have always lived with danger. To say
nothing of the fact that you have no idea how many
friends one discovers in the world when one is petse-
cuted by the United StabogeNite truly, for all these
reasons, we are not suppliants, we ask nothing. I'll
tell you something else: since the rupture and the
blockade, we have forgotten the United States. We feel
neither hatred nor resentment any more, we simply
don’t think about the US. When I think of the problems

which diplomatic relations with the United States
would pose! The Swiss Ambassador presenting the
US at present. I prefer to do business with him than
with 200 members of an Embassy among whom surely
some spies would be spotted

“T have just talked to you as a Cuban revolutionary.
But I should also speak to you as a peace lover, and
from this viewpoint [ believe the United States is too
important a country not to have an influence on world
peace. I cannot help hoping, therefore, that a leader
will come to the fore in North America (why not Ken~
nedy, there are things in his favor!), who will be willing
to brave unpopularity, fight the trusts, tell the truth
and, most important, let the various nations act-as
they see fit. T ask nothing: neither dollars, nor assist-
ance, not diplumats, nor bankers, nor military men--
nothing but peace, and to be accepted as we are! We
are socialists, the United States is a capitalist nation,
the Latin. American countries will choose what they
want. All'the same, at a time when the United States
is selling wheat to the Russians, Canada is trading with
China, de Gaulle respects Ben Bella, why should it be
impossible to make the Americans understand that
socialism leads, not to hostility toward them, but to co-
existence? Why am 1 not Tito or Sekou Touré? Because
the Russians have never done us any injury such as
the Yugoslavians and the Guineans have complained
of in the past, and because the Americans have never
given us any of the benefits for which these two nations
congratulate themselves today.

“As to this matter of fearing Soviet intentions in
Latin America through Cuba’s. subversive activitie:.
this is just attributing to others one’s own desire to
dominate. You said yourself just a little while ago tha:
the Russians have had enough of their Cuban involve-
ment. Economically this is obvious. This is why, speak-
ing from a military viewpoint, it is better not to force
nations io turn to the Russians for help. Really, it
scems to me that a man like Kennedy is capable of
seeing that it is not in the United States’ interest to
pursue a policy which can lead only to a stalemate. So
far as we are concerned, everything can be restored to
normalcy on the basis of mutual respect of sover-
cignty.”

In conclusion, Fidel Castro said to me: “Since you
are going to sce Kennedy again, be an emissary of
peace, despite everything. | want to make myself clear:
I don’t want anything, [ don’t expect anything, and
as a revolutionary, the present situation does not dis-
please me. But.as a man and as a statesrin, it is my
duty to indicate what the bases for understanding
could be.”

All this was said two days before President Ken-
nedy’s death,

The minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting (dated June 22, 1964)
contained the following: | (OBTAIN copy] (signed by Peter Jessup)
"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve

the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.

Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical of the reported plots and
stated that he would like to go into the matter further.
Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was
being put on notice and should do everything in its power to
ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under-
take prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the

matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law
enforcement.”

Mr. ‘McCone's personal memorandum for the record on this
meeting (dated) June 18, 1964, contains substantially the same
information. [OBTAIN COPY] It refers to a June 10, 1964, CIA
memorandum “reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate
leading Cuban government leaders. This memo apparently had
been sent to Special Group members and the Attorney General.
[OBTAIN COPY] McCone's "pre contains the following:

“ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms steps we
should take to establish ithe credibility. of the report; also
communicate with the FBI ithrough Mr. Papich. Also I should

call the Attorney General) personally."

The official minutesi of the July 30, 1964, 303 Committee
meeting (dated July 31, 1964) (referred to in 1967 IG report)
contain no mention of assassination or even of Cuba.

Mr. McCone's personal memorandum (dated July 31, 1964) had
only the following reference to Cuba:

"Proposed infiltration/exfiltration operations into Cuba for
August were approved and the July operations were noted." .

were hiving unc in the living room of the modest
mer residence which Fidel Castro owns on magai-
ent Varadero Beach, 120 kilometers from Hav.
For at feast the tenth time, I was questioning the Cuban
leader on details of the. negotiations with Russia before
the missile installations last year. The telephone rang,
a secretary in guerrilla garb announced that Mg, Dor-
ticds, Prosident of the Cuban Republic had an urgent
communicati i i idel picked!
she phone and [ heard him say: “Como? Un atentady?”
‘What's that? An attempted assassination?”) He then
turned to-us to say that Kennedy had just been struck
down in Dallas. Then he went back a the telep! none
and exclaimed in a loud voice “Herido? Muy grave-
niente” ("Wounded? Very seriously?”) |
He came back, sat down, and repeated three times
he words: “Es una mala noticia.” (“This is bad news.”)
He remained silent for a moment, awaiting another call
with further news. He remarked while we waited that
there wa’ an alarmingly sizable lunatic fringe in Amer-
can society and that this deed could equally well have
ve” ne work of a madman or of a terrorist. Perhar
Vietnamese? Or a member of the Ku Klux Klan? The
veond call came through: it was hoped they would 'be
abic to announce that the United ‘States President was
‘ill ative, that there was hope of saving him. Fidel
Castro’s immediate reaction was: “If they can, hey is
eady re-elected.” He pronounced these words with
satisfaction.
This sentence was a sequel to a conversation we had
icld on a previous evening and which had turned into
in all-night session. To be precise, it lasted from zorin
the evening until 4 in the morning. A good part |of
the talk revolved about the impressions I recounted
to him of an inierview which President Kennedy
granted me this last October 24, and about Fidel
Castro’s reactions to these impressions. During this
nocturnal discussion, Castro had delivered himself laf
+ relentless indictment of US policy, adding that in, the
recent past Washington had had ample opportunity

su

to normalize its relations with Cuba, but that instead

wthad tolerated a CIA program of training, equipping
and organizing a counter-revolution. He had told ine
at he wasn’t in the least fearful of his life, singe
danger was his natural milieu, and if he were to become
i victim of the United.States this would simply en-
ha. his radius of influence in Latin America as well
as throughout the socialist world. He was speaking, he
said, from the viewpdS of the interests of peace jin

both the American continastsackeachieve this goat, a

leader would have 'to arise in the United States capable
of urderstanding the explosive realities of Latin Amer-
ica and of meeting them halfway. Thea, suddenly, he
had taken a less hostile tack “Kennedy could still be
this man. He still has the possibility of becoming,
in the eyes of history, the greatest President of the
United States, the leader who may at last understand
that there can be coexistence between capitalists and
socialists, even in the Americas. He would then be
an even greater President than Lincoln. 1 know, for
example, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a man you
can talk with. I have gotten this impression from all
my conversations with Khrushchev. Other leaders have
assured me that to attain this goal, we must first await
his re-election. Personally, | consider him responsible
for everything, but I will say this: he has come to
understand many things over the past few. months;
and then too, in the last analysis, I’m convinced that
anyone clse would be worse.” Then Fidel had added
with a broad and boyish grin: “If you sce him again,
you can tell him that I‘ ecnsilling to declare Goldwater
my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy’s re-election!”

This conversation was held on November x9.

Now it was nearly 2 o'clock and we got up from
the table and settled ourselves in front of a radio.
Commandant Vallero, his physician, aide-de-camp, and
intimate friend, was easily able to get the broadcasts
ne) the NBC network in Miami As the news came
in, Vallero would translate it for. Fidel: Kennedy
wounded in the head; pursuit of the assassin; murder
of a policeman; finally the fatal announcement: Presi-
dent Kennedy is dead, Then Fidel stood up and said to
me: “Everything is changed. Everything is going to
change. The United States occupies such a position in
world affairs that the death of a President of that
country affects millions of people in every corner of
the globe. The cold war, relations with Russia, Latin
America, Cuba, the Negro question . . . all will have to
be rethought. I'll tell you one thing: at least Kennedy
was an enemy to whom we had become accustomed.
This is a serious matter, an extremely serious matter.”

After the quarter-hour of silence observed by all
the American radio stations, we once more tuned in
on Miami; the silence had only been broken by a re-
broddeasting of the American national anthem. Strange
indeed was the impression made, on hearing this hymn
ring out in the house of Fidel Castro, in thé midst of a
circ: of worried faces. “Now,” Fidel said, “they will

the Sierra there were some (Rolin my group in an
other) who wanted to kill Batista. They thought they
could do away with a regime by decapitating it. I have
always been violently opposed to such niethods. First
of all from the viewpoint of political self-interest, be-
cause so far as Cuba is concerned, if Batista had been
killed he would have been replaced by some military
figure who would have tried to make the revolutionists
pay for the martyrdom of the dictator. But I was also
opposed to it on personal grounds; assassination is
repellent to me.” |

The broadcasts were now resumed. One reporter
felt he should mention the difficulty Mrs. Kennedy
was having in getting tid of her bloodstained stockings.
Fidel exploded: “What sort of a mind isithis!” He re-
peated the remark several times: “What sort of a
mind is this? There is a difference in our civilizations
after all. Are you like this in Europe?| For us Latin
‘Americans, death is a sacred matter; not only does it
mark the close of hostilities, but it also imposes de-
cency, dignity, respect. There are even istreet urchins
who behave like kings in the face of death. Incidentally,
this reminds me of something else: if:you write all
those things I told you ycRmBday against Kennedy's
policy, don’t use his name now; speak jnstead of the
policy of the United States government.

Toward 5 o'clock, Fidel Castro declared that since
there was nothing we could do to alter the tragedy, we
must try to put our time to good use in'spite of it. He
waited to accompany me in person on a visit to a
granja de pucblo (state farm), where h¢ had been en-
gaging in some experiments. His present obsession’ is
agriculture. He reads nothing but agrontomical studies
and reports. He dwells lyrically on the soil, fertilizers,
and the possibilities which will give |Cuba. enough
sugar cane by 1970 to achieve.economic! independence.

|

“Didn't 1 Tell You”

We went by car, with the radio of, The Dallas
police were now hot on the trail-of the assassin. He
is a Russian spy, says the news commentator. Five
minutes later, correction: he is. a spy married to a
Russian. Fidel said: “There, didn’t T rell yous i'll be

_Zmy.turn next.” Butaest yet. The next Sword was: the

‘assassin is a Marxist deserter. Then the word came
through, in effect, that the assassin was a young man
who was a member of the “Fair Play for Cuba Com-
mittee,” that he was an adinirer of Fidel Castro. Fidel
declared: “If they had had proof, they vould have said

sent, an accomplice, a hired killer. In
saying simply that he is an admiggs, this is just to try

ociation in people's minds between the
name of Castro and the emotion awakened by the
assassination. This is a publicity method, a propaganda
device. It's terrible. But you know, I'm sure this will
all soon blow over. There are too many competing
policies in the United States for any single one to be
able to impose itself universally for very long.”

We arrived at the granja de pueblo, where the farm-
ers welcomed Fidel. At that very moment, a speaker
announced over the radio that it was now known that
the assassin is a “pro-Castro Marxist.” One commen-
tator followed another; the remarks became increas-
ingly emotional, increasingly aggressive. Fidel then
excused himself: “We shall have to give up the visit
to the farm.” We wenton toward Matanzas fromoubere
he could telephone PessidentDarsicas, On the way he ”
had questions: “Who is Lyndon Johnson? What is his
reputation? What were his relations with Kennedy?
With Khrushchev? What was his position at the time of
the attempted invasion of Cuba?” Finally and most
important of all: “WYbat authority docs be exercise
over the CIA?” Then abruptly he looked at his watch,
Saw that it would be half an hour before we reached
Matanzas and, practically on the spot, he dropped off to
sleep.

After Matanzas, where he must have decreed a state
of alert, we returned to Varadero for dinner. Quoting
the words spoken to him by a woman shortly before,
he said to me that it was an irony of history for the
Cubans, in the situation to which they had been re-
duced by the blockade, to have to mourn the death of
a President of the United States. “After all,” he added,
“there are perhaps some people in the world to whom
this news is cause for rejoicing. The South Vietnamese
guertillas, for example, and also, I would imagine,
Madame Nhu!"

I thought of the people of Cuba, accustomed to the
sight of posters like the one depicting the Red Army
with maquis superimposed in front, and the screaming
captions “HALT, MR. KENNEDY! CUBA 15 NOT ALONE, « tee
I thought of all those who had been led to associate
their deprivations with the policies of President John
F, Kennedy.

‘At dinner I was able to take up all my questions.
What had motivated Castro to endanger the peace of
the world with the missiles in Cuba? How dependent
was Cuba on the Sovict Union? Is it not possible to
envisage relations between Cuba andthe United States
along the.same lines as those betwéeri Finland and the
Russians? How was the transition made from the

an

and make an as

Flash from Dallas

Just as Secret Service men reacted instinctively, rushing to protect the
presidential party, reporters reacted instinctively to get the news—sketchy
as it was at first-to the world. United Press International's Merriman
Smith, dean of the White House correspondents, describes on pages 32-33
his frantic rush to call the Dallas UPL bureau. Reproduced here is the result
of Smith's first efforts—the actual Teletype copy that almost immediately
ked out of hundreds of UPL machines in newsrooms, radio and
ion stations, pressrooms, and business offices all over the world.

At 12:34 the Teletype was
supplying copy ona
Minneapolis murder trial.

The Dallas bureau, alerted by
Smith over radiotelephone from
the press car as it careered
toward the hospital, sends out
the first sparse news.

Minneapolis starts to add more
details on the murder trial. The
New York bureau, knowing

that ace reporter Smith is covering
the President's trip, tells all
bureaus to “uphold”—get off the
wire. “Dallas, it’s yours.”

Atlanta tries to interrupt, but is
quickly squelched by the
New York bureau.

The Dallas operator begins
sending the rest of Smith's account
from the press car.

At the hospital, Smith sees the
President’s limp body in the car
and races to a telephone. At

12:39, nine minutes after the
shooting, the grave news flashes
over the wire.

Now reporter Smith is dictating a
story ready for printing.

Smith rolls on, swiftly and
fluently, adding fresh details as
“pandemonium” breaks out

in the corridor outside his
telephone niche.

Searching his mind for
impressions of the shooting,
Smith adds all he can remember
to the story. The shaken wire
operator stumbles in the

second line.

As yet nothing is known of the
sniper, what kind of weapon

he used, or where the

shots came from.

SUBJECT: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach telephoned at 10:50 a.m,

He said he had just completed talking on the telephone with Alexis Johnson,

Deputy Under Secretary of State. Johnson told Katzenbach that insofar as
the investigation of this matter in Mexico is concerned, the State Department

felt this should be coordinated and directed by the FBI. State took the
position that the President 's directive to the FBI extended to any activity
outside of the United States, as well as within the country. Insofar as the
| Ambassador in Mexico is concerned, Johnson believed he should be kept

informed of any pertinent developments but that the Ambassador should not
be running the investigation,

* As to current developments, Katzenbach said that the last thi:
he would want would be for the FBI to take Agents away from their investiga -
tive duties to prepare reports. He requested, however, that if there were

rl, } 225,pertinent developments he. be_orally. briefed. :

Nae ewes Crear cer nh combina, Cn CO i

With further reference to his conversation with Alexis Johnson, ~
Katzenbach said he had been asked whether the State Department should makes
a formal inquiry of the Soviet Government for information concerning Oswald "
and his wife, particularly as to their activities in Russia, He asked that this

of
ian

question be considered by the Director, as Katzenbach felt his views mo
important,

In thinking about the matter himself, Katzenbach noted if we
did not ask the Soviets for information there would »e no answer should the
question of Oswald's stay in Russia be raised, other than to admit we had
made no inquiry. On the other hand, he observed that we could not place fa
any reliance on anything the Soviets said. Gg

Dear Mr. Heacock: i Od) SIp S97

Thank you for writing to me regarding your knowledge of
the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. I understand
that you have discussed these questions at length with members
of the Committee staff.

On March 1 the Committee reported S. Res. 400 creating
a Senate Committee on Intelligence Activities. The legislation
which was before us concerned only the establishment of a new
congressional conmittee; it did not involve revisions that. would
significantly modify the structure or the powers of the CIA it-
self, ‘The Committee has not been authorized to hire additional
staff personnel for the purpose of this legislation. Further-
more, we were under instructions from the Senate to report out a.
formal: recommendation in the form of legislation by March 1.

I am, however, deeply concerned with the charges you
have made because, if true, they represent grave examples of
corruption and criminality. It is my hope and intent that the
new committee created by the legislation we are considering,
once it is established, will have the jurisdiction and the re-
sources to explore the kind of issues which you raise.

I assure you that the entirety of the information you
have submitted to my committee will be made available to the
new Congressional oversight committee.

I am sure you understand the constraints on the Govern-
ment Operations Committee which prevent us from undertaking the
investigations you suggest, but I shall forward the material
you submitted to the new committee as soon as it is established...

‘For your information, I am enclosing a copy of S. Res.
400 and a copy of the committee's report on this measure.

Sincerely,

Abe Ribicof£

Dear Senator Caurch:

I commend the diligent efforts of you, the members and the staff in produce
ing and especially in publishing the Committee's report on "Allaged Assass~
ination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders,"

Nevertheless, I mist adviso you that over 200 pages of countorintalligence
on d tie and foreign assassinations of tha CIA { have provided or mado
available to atafi and members has been dlavegarded or deliberately with-
held fron members. - : .

Consequently, a3 members ave preparing to sign a final report, it is tinely
to list some of the disastrous errors of the interim report. The errors
‘aro the rasult of intentionsl misropresuntation and deceit of the Congress
and the “American electorate by the CIA, its directors and employees.

(1) Tne ZR/RTFLE Executive Action program begun in 1960, headed by Wil
liam Harvey, was designed ag a donestic asgausination capability.

(2) Under the direct planning and inplamentation of Harvey, a number of
domostic and foraign assassinations were exccuted,

(3) Harvey's roal nana is William 8, Wood, alias Williaa Boxley, alias
wd. J. Wood, His assassinations in USA I hava already reported,

(4) Anong foreign assassinations with participation by Neod's donostic
tean memdera on foreign duty are those of Lumumba and Trujillo.

(5) Ordera passed by CIA for execution, rather than oxiling. or kidnapping,
caused the deaths of Ngo Diem, Ngo Nhu and Rene Schnedder.

(S) CIA gave the code naze WAI to the organized crise assasaination
consultent employed to insure the killing of Patrice Lumumba, His
Yoal name is Michael Genoves2, alias Vietor Resignio, son of Vito
Genovese, boss of bosses of the Kafia in Atlanta fedoval prison
until he died. Genoveas enjoyed assassination authority independant
of CIA directors delegated by Moyer Lansky, boss of tha American
international erima syndicate thon. Neither President Eisenhower nor
Presidant Kennedy confercod asgassination authority upon CIA.

(7) Genovese, as Victor Resignio, directed an aras and supplies diversion
and currency manipulation racket in South Vietnan in 1966-67 that cost
the Treasury $51.8 billion, Executive Dopartents! total, not mino.

(8) Wood's crime team inumber that aided Genovese to assure Lumumba's death
was code named WI/RCGUE, He 4s Frank Sturgis, Watergate burglar.

am alanned that no witness had pointed a fingor of blame at the Central.
Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, It is tha agua Charta of CIA's Doa-
estic Intalligence Division. ‘This act specifically provided cover for
CIA. It effectively repealed CIA's restriction to foreign operations
intended by Congreas to prevent a police state.

The 1949 act authorized CIA to conceaal huge porblons of its budget and
minel within the budgets dad personnel roster of domestic agencies
mmant. These especially include enployees on Capitol Hill,

Q r overrode my caution, I wrote
all fifteen members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee February
> 23, 1969. I demanded that Hawkridge be heard by the Senatz. Although
I reveived no replies, this forced Caraine Bellino's hand and Hawke
ridge was subpoenaed, The recipients referred some letters to your
Conmnlt tacs pa

Six months earlier my letter of August 14, 1968 to the Foreign Relations
Comittee enclosed a 606 pagejstuiy entitled "Assassinations of the
ia veial State." It concluded with tho startling premise I am now
propared to prove to the Se:

"It is my fira predic tion} that when the Foreign Relations
Committees get to the bottom of the CIA's conspiracy to
usurp Congress! foreign policy authority they will also
have solved the conspiracies behind the continuing
assassinations of the industrial state." .

I rely upon your fairness for oprortunity to refute the clains of
william Colby, Director of Central Intelligonce, to testify and to ald
your Committas to draft Legislation that will effectively prevent
abuses of power by the govermont's intelligence agencies,

As an Air Force officer befora, during and after World War II, I am
concerned, as I know you are, that our country's security will be pro~
tected. I will testify for more effective legitimate intelligence and
counterintelligence services, Perhaps the most effective testimony I
can give is that which will establish that the CIA has been thoroughly
infiltrated and corrupted by double agents who owa their primary
loyalty to the Soviet KGB. :

SOURCE, SOURCE EVALUATION, APPRAISAL OF CONTENT: Cuban government official (8) eae
Appraisal of Content:3 i 7

1. Agents of the Servicio de Inteligencia Militar (SIM, Cuban Military Intelligence
Service) are reported to have identified definitely the assassins of Lt. Cel.
Antonio BLANCO Rico, former chief of SIM killed on 22 Octcber 1956 at the Ment-
martre nightclub. On 29 November 1956 SIM egents ‘interrogated Dr. Armando CARDENAS
Aranguren, instructor cf pathology at the University of Eebana, end succeeded
in obtaining an admission fron CARDENAS that Juan Pedro CARSO Servid end Rolando
CUBELAS Secades‘had sought refuge at his house after the assassination of SLANCO
Rico and had remained there eooroximately three or four days. CARDENAS stated
during interrcgation that CA839 had arrived at his house carrying @ sub-rachine

i‘ gun. On the basis of CARDENAS’ admissions, SIM officials are convinced that
CARBO and CUSELAS were the ones who killed ELANCO Rico.

2. Implication of CARDENAS and CUBELAS resulted from the interception of a cable
by SIM sent fron Miami, Florida, by a friend of CUBELAS to Virginia SECADES, 7
mother of CUBELAS, in Habana. On, 27 Novemoer 1956 Virginia SECASES was arrested
by SIM and taken. to SIM headquarters for questioning concerning her son's varti-
cipation in the assassination ot BLANCO Rico. SIM agents were unable to obtain

_any information from SECADES concerning her son's role in the killing but suc-
ceeded in léarning that CARDENAS was a close friend of her son, On 29 tioverber
1956 SIM agents picked up CARDENAS,who, under pressure, admitted that he was
a homosexual, that CUSELAS was his intimate friend, and that he had hidden
CUBELAS and CAR&O in his home for about four days. These admissions were made
at SIM headquarters in the presence of Colonel Trenaldo GARCIA Baez, deputy
chief of SIM, Lt. Col. Marcelo TASERNILLA, who was wounded during the shooting
of BLANCO Rico, and other high SIM officials.

interrogation of CARDENAS failed ie reveal the destination of CARBO and CUBELAS
after they. left the home of CARDENA On the basis of the intercepted cable,
dated 23 November 1956, however, 7 officials believe that CARGO and CLBELAS

4. SIM has transmitted the results of interrogation of SECADES and CARDENAS to jee
President Fulgencio BATISTA, but the latter's reactign to these new cevelop- 7

: ments is not known. Further action by the Cuban-authorities is complicated
by the fact that the Government's main witness, CARCENAS, is of dubious re-
Viability, because of his homosexuality. CARDENAS is also reported to te
the doctor of the family of Santiaco VERDEJA Neyra, Minister of Cefense, who
vouched for him wnen he was arrested by SIM.

Field Comments:

J. Office files contain no previous record of CARDENAS in connection with
anti-BATISTA activities. A Or. Armando CARDENAS was listed’in Koy (defunct
newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party), issue of 22 April 1969, as one ©
of the persons who sent greetings to the World Corgress of Peace Partisans,
scheduled to begin in Paris on 20 April 1949.

2. Both CAR3O and CUSELAS have been the subjects in the past of cenunctations
and arrests by the Cuban authorities as a result of their anti-SATISTA
activities. . They were accused in August 1955 by Colonel Orlanco PIEDRA,
chief of thé Department of Investigations, of having fled from the police
from the site of an arms cache. In February 1956 CUBELAS was arrested and
tried on charges of participating in student disorders, according to articles
which appeared in local newspapers on 15 March 1956 and 1 April 1956. CARBO
was denounced by the Cuban police as one of BLANCO Rico's killers imnediately
after the shooting incident at the Montmartre nightclub.

3. Office files contain no previous record of Virginia SECADES, Habana news-
papers of 29 November 1956 carried an item in which the University of Habana
Student Federation protested against the detention of Virginia SECACES by
SIM.

4, Files of the Consular Section, United States Embassy, Habana, revealed
that CARBO was issued a tourist visa on 3 dune 1954 and that CUBELAS re-
ceived a similar visa on 15 October 1954. The files do not indicate
whether these visas were valid for a single entry or multiple entries, but
Pe could still be valid, on the basis of the dates of issue.

{

BOM
5. FRC officials announced immediately after the assassination of BLANCO
: ise '<o that they had information as to the identity of the two assassins,
AIG 5S aming CARBO but not his accomplice, and that they were on the trail of
" the latter. .The police have failed to find the killers, however, and re- :

possible that CARDENAS may have been forced by SIM interrogators to make
statements implicating CAR30 and CUBELAS which were not altogether true.

: 6. The local press and radio reported on 29 and 30 November 1956 that United RS
States authorities were looking in New Orleans for two Cubans who were sus- v
pected of being the killers of BLANCO Rico. They were identified by name as om
Rolando CUSELAS Secades and Guillermo GARCIA Riestra. The latter, wnile a
student et the University of Habana, was eccused of having participated in
an attempt against the life of Rolando MASFERRER in September 1949, accord-

SUBJECT: SSC Request

REFERENCE:. RS 76~-0083/A (14 January 1976)

1. Re question number 1 of reference: Attachment “A" contains
the names of Agency personnel who were in tlexico City, Mexico, during
the period 1 September 1963 through 31 December 1963 and who are still
on duty. Attachment "B" contains the names of Agency personnel who
were in ifexico City during this same period but are now retired or no
longer on duty. It is understood that these attachments will be
retained in the Headquarters building for use by the Committee Staff.

2. Re question number 3(a) of reference: For your background,
‘the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) was a Cuban student
exile entity founded in September 1960 as an anti-Communist revolutionary
organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Castro regime} ‘The parent
organization of the DRE was the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), a revolu-

tionary organization of Cuban students opposed to the Batista regime

which actively joined the Castro forces by organizing a guerrilla move~
ment which contributed greatly to tie collapse of the Batista regime.
The Castro government, themselves of student origin, recognized the DR
power and by-passed them politically by forming the new regime without
their participation. The original DR became Communist controlled and
directed. While the Agency had no role in the founding, the DRE was an
entity used by the CIA as a unilateral asset in pursuing U.S. policy
objectives. CIA support to the DRE ceased on 30 September 1966 and formally
terminated on 1 January 1967. At that time DRE files were reviewed and
material dealing with CIA support and operations were either destroyed
or turned over the JMWAVE Station. The DRE was expected to continue as
an organizational entity and continue its activities independent of CIA.

3. The DRE files of both Station JMWAVE and ileadquarters that are
available have been reviewed and Lee Harvey Oswald's name does not appear
in these files. WAVE cable 8049 (in 66782) of 22 November 1963, states
in the third sentence, “according AMSPELL files, Oswald", undoubtedly
refers to the DRE‘files maintained in the DRE office in Miami, Florida.

These entity files were independent of the JMWAVE Station files. Had
Station JMWAVE referred to its files in WAVE 8049 the cable would have
been worded, “according AUSPELL Station files." The file of AMHINT-53,
a former executive of the DRE, has also been reviewed and no. reference
to Oswald was found. The file number which appears on WAVE 8049 is no
longer in use and the contents of this former file were transferred
into Oswald's and other 201 files by the CI Staff. A tape of the radio

Staff. if

determine if Station JMWAVE was instructed to. review its files for
information on Oswald. For. many years the CI Staff has been tne focal
point for the collation of any and all information concerning Oswald
and if the JMWAVE files on any Cuban groups contained information on
Oswald such information should be reflected in Oswald 201 file.

MEMORANDUM i

TO: Jin Johnston; Paul Wallach

FROM: Dan Dwyer :

DATE: January 21, 1976

SUBJ: ; CIA Briefing with Raymond Rocca Regarding Oswald

Early in our-investigation of CIA's handling of the Oswald case,
Raymond Rocca briefed Wallach, Dwyer and Greissing on November 11 and
13, 1975. Some of Rocco's comments merit consideration in light of
our present knowledge of the case.

1. Opening of 201

Rocca explained that Oswald’ s 201 was opened by Betty Egerter::
from a list of American defectors 1958-1960 from the State Department.

2 Status of 201, 11/22/63
Esser ceteecreeeee reece couaceereeeerornEEEEE ee

Rocca explained that @November 22, 1963 all documents in the
Oswald 201 were originated by other agencies; Mexico City cable
Be was not included in, the 201 because it was routed through
a conpartmentalized channel and therefore would not be circulated

viathe 201. ;

aE Oswald's Defection to! USSR

With regard to Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, Rocca
said Oswald would have been.of interest to the military and the FBI
and that CIA was only interested in the “information” aspect of the
case. Rocca could not cite’any, example of a U.S. citizen defecting
on behalf of any interest of the U.S. government.

With regard to the "Hoover" memorandum.of June 3, 1960 raising
the possibility that an imposter could be using Oswald's birth certifi-
cate, Rocca believed Hoover. would not have generated it. Rocca sug-
gested someone at the Bureau who was familiar with Soviet technique
of using birth certificates for illegals -- Larry McWilliams, Brannigan

“or Cregar -- would have authored the memo. (Rocca could never establish
if, in fact, Oswald took his birth certificate with him to the Soviet
Union. ) Rocca commented that the Bureau memo, sent to State and ONI,
should have been forwarded to CIA by State, but never was.

In Rocca's determinatiion, Oswald was the only American defector
who was allowed to stay in Russia following a suicide attempt. Rocca
said that Oswald would have been subjected to one or two assessments
by the KGB.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 574


HW 50955

Rocca referred to an $B study, directed by Lee Wigren and con-
ducted by Virginia Valpi which compared the Oswald case to other U.S.
defectors and their wives. (SB concluded.Oswald was not given special
handling by the KGB. Rocca‘maintains Oswald was given special treat-
ment. He believes Oswald's relationship with the "Red Cross" (from
which Oswald received finandial assistance) and the Red Cross' relation-
ship with the KGB should be. ‘clarified.

Rocca also finds it peculiar that Marina married Oswald since
Marina's uncle was KGB. Rocca said that Oswald was the only defector
who married someone with a KGB connection of that kind. Rocca said that
the CIA developed this information after the assassination.

Rocca described Minsk as "not an unsensitive section" of Russia
and added that Oswald was the only American defector in Minsk, a white
Russian area. :

Rocca commented on Oswald’ s.surprise visit to the American Em-
bassy in Moscow by saying that "people don't do that kind of thing
in Russia." | :

Rocca believes Oswald's Soviet diary is bona fide. Rocca ad-
mitted that although there are perceptible changes in the quality
of Oswald's written material, Oswalds' mentality seemed conducive
to periods of attention to thoroughness and detail.

4, Alleged Debriefing of Oswald

Rocca did not have any knowledge of an alleged debriefing of
Oswald in New York City by the DCD. Rocca said that if a debriefing
report existed; it would have been distributed in 00 series (overt
operations) of the DDI (now DDO). Rocca also noted that a debriefing
report would not have been filed in the Oswald 201. Rocca noted that
a Dr. Froyn (phonetic) supervised DDI records. Rocca also said that
Traveler's Aid was a legitimate charitable organization which had no
ties with the CIA.

5. Oswald and Mexico City - ieee

Rocca said that Chief, WH could clarify aspects of technical
operations on Cuban and Soviet Embassies. Rocca said that David
Phillips organized the technical surveillance.

Although the Cuban Embassy was officially closed on September
28, Rocca found nothing unusual about Oswald's visit there and meeting
Silvi Duran, Cuban consulate employee.

Rocca emphasized that ‘Oswald's activities in Mexico City were
the responsibility of the FBI.

DocId: 32423630 Page 575

6. Possible Oswald-Cuban' Connections

Rocca described document gaps in the materials that the Russian
and Cuban governments forwarded to the WC via diplomatic channels.
He described these areas as "open and relevant."

Rocca drew attention to Oswald's Marine duty in California in
1958. Basing most of his analysis on testimony of DelGado, Oswald's
sergeant in California, Rocca maintained that Oswald had made contact
with the Cubans at the Cuban Embassy in Los Angeles. Rocca said that
DelGado had to release Oswald. from guard duty because someone from Los
Angeles reinitiated contact while Oswald was on duty.

Rocca placed specific.emphasis on Castro's" impromptu "comments
to Harker at the Brazilian Embassy in Havana on September 7, 1963.
Rocca viewed Castro's comments as a "message" to American leaders
and said it was a "very important signpost," Rocca added that the
Mexico City Station brought Castro's comments to Headquarter's atten-
tion on 11/25/63. Rocca also viewed Castro's comments in terms of
Oswald's possible perception of them, since New Orleans Times Picayune
ran the Harker atticle on September 9, 1963. (This is the line Slawson
adopted: could Oswald have’ read the piece?)

In regard to the Castro comments (unfortunately my notes are
sketchy here) Rocca refers to a 10/24/63 cable, memo, or letter from,
"Des.to Paris." He then refers to an 11/5/63 memo for the record and
said "man never heard from again.'"' Rocca should be asked to clarify
these references.

Rocca briefly outlined Cuban-Russian relations in the early 1960s.
he described 1961 as the "seed time" between Cuba and the USSR. Rocca
said that following the missile crisis, the KGB and DGI began a "pre-
liminary relationship."' Rocca mentioned Srotoff (phonetic) and
Alexiev (sic) as being KGB principals involved. Rocca said that when
Castro visited Moscow in June-July 1963, Alexiev and Leonoff served
as liaison between Kruschev and Castro. Rocca referred to an escalation
of Alpha-66 activity (sporadic revolutionary attacks on Cuban ports,
vessels, etc.) in July-August 1963, Rocca places Castro's "warning"
of September 7, 1963 in the context of these activities.

Rocca said that Oswald's activities for the FPCC in New Orleans
were apparently self-motivated. Rocca added, however, that V. T. Lee,
national chairman of the FPCC, visited Cuba in 1964. Rocca noted that
(fnu) Hernandez handled Lee's case and that Hermandez' office was next
to Azcue's, who, according to Duran, argued with Oswald at the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City. According to Rocca, Hernandez was mentioned
in penetration reports from Guatemala where Hernandez was running two
DGI agents. Rocca outlined these relationships briefly to demonstrate
DGI-FPCC connections. Rocca concluded that the Warren Commission should

i attention to the DGI. Rocca also mentioned that the
who

was handled by WH Division. |

NW 50955 Docld:32423630° Page 576


7. Oswald, New Orleans, Garrison Case

Rocca said that the cr/R and A stayed on top of the Garrison case
and "summarized overt developments." Rocca identified the analyst
for the Garrison material as Donald Pratt. Rocca said that by NSA
intercepts and associated relationships, the CIA believed Garrison
was operating (unwittingly) under KGB manipulation. (Rocca briefly
described Soviet technique of misinformation. He recalled an inter-
view that Drew Pearson had with Kruschev in Cairo in 1964 or 1965.
Kruschev told Pearson that his "gut feeling" was that American xright-
wing extremists and capitalists were responsible for thePresident's
assassination. Rocca said this typified KGB disinformation.)

Rocca characterized Oreste Pena's allegations as "absolute
fabrication." Rocca said CIA files revealed that. Clay Shaw was. a
contact of the DCD until 1956. :

Rocca said that he was' never informed in 1962.or 1963 about
a revolutionary training camp around Lake Pontchartrain, He believes
that the GIA did not know of; its existence. Rocca said there is evi-
dence that messages from the Lake Pontchartrain camp were going to a
drop in Mexico City. : :

8. GPFLOOR ‘Period

GPFLOOR was the crypt ‘used to describe the investigation con-
ducted by CIA following the President's assassination (11/23-1/12-15/63.)
The Mexico City aspect of GPFLOOR was controlled by WH: J. C. King,
Chief; Jack Whiten, Desk Chief, and Win Scott, COS, Mexico City. Rocca
said that Whiten would report Mexico City developments to Helms who
would then inform McCone.

9. End of. GPFLOOR: Warren Commission

With the formation of the Warren Commission, the GPFLOOR period
ended. Rocca explained that Helms served as the major liaison between
the CIA and WC. Rocca served as chief of research for matters of in-
terest to the WC -- mostly. concerning Oswald's defection to Russia.
Rocca's staff included: Thomas Hall, Arthur Dooley and Paul Hartman.

“Hall conducted research on Soviet service in DDO. Dooley followed all
Bureau developments forwarded to CIA. Hartman was responsible for ex-
ploration of overt references and Soviet service." Additionally, Hartman
researched DeMohrenschildt's relationship to the Oswalds.

Rocca reported his research staff's findings to Angleton; Rocca
had no contact with Helms. ‘Rocca explained that he had some liaison
with Slawson of the WC staff. Rocca said that any negotiation between
the CIA and WC was conducted by Helms, Dulles, and Rankin. Rocca said
he had no knowledge of any CIA assassination attempts against Castro.

Rocca emphasized that the FBI was the investigative arm for the
Warren Commission. Rocca said that Sam Papich, Dick O'Niell (sic) and
Jim Hunt were the Bureau personnel involved with the WC.

Rocca said that additional Pocearch| in CI was conducted by
David Murphy and Bagley, Chief and Deputy! Chief of CI/SB. Rocca
said that Lee Wigren and Virginia Valpi were also involved in
Soviet R&A. |

10. Rockefeller Commission Inquiry

Rocca served as CIA liaison to the Rockefeller Commission
in regard to Warren Commission allegations. Belin and Robert Olsen
were involved in the investigation. Belin wanted Rocca to review
documentation regarding the'photo of the unidentified individual
in Mexico City. Belin told Rocca that the Warren Commission was not
clued in on Cuban emigrecissues and Operation MONGOOSE. Rocca de-
veloped the impression that the Rockefeller Commission was looking
into CIA's operations aimed'at Castro. Belin asked Rocca for the
Castro comments of September 7, 1963. Belin was not aware of the
statements during the Warren Commission.  (Slawson, however, was but
oniy at the conclusion of the WC.)-

Rocca also said that Belin is writing another book on Oswald
and the President's assassination.

I then got a call from Bundy on October 2nd, and’ he said

that -- Chase, I think his name was, Peter Chase, one of his

assistants -- is the person to be in touch with, and to keep

him apprised of all developments.
I later, again got'a word from Jean Daniel, the French
i
correspondent who had come hack from Havanna saying Cuba seemed
ripe for a conversation. So this also came from another source,
a Greek town planner named *Doxiati;,. who said that Castro was

very much interested in some kind of normalization relation,

but that Che Guevera and Raul were opposed.

October 21st, I got a call again’ from Bundy's office asking

|
me what was new. I said, well the ball is now, in the Cuban's

i
court. 1

On the 28th, I saw Lochuga again! at the UN who said that
Havanna didn't see exactly how a talk’ would be useful now, but
he would be glad to maintain continuous contact with me anyway.

The 4th of November I brisfed eeeyeneca on these develop~
ments and meanwhile, Miss Howard had been pul the phone with
Rene Valao who was Fidel Castro's aide at that point, and who
was one of the so-called pro-Americans in the group and who
suggested that I get in touch with him by telephone.

I then briefed Bundy on this: 0m: the 5th of November
Bundy told me that the President was more in.favor of pushing
)
towards an opening toward Cuba than was the State Department,

the idea being -- well, getting them out of the Soviet fald. and

Perhaps wiping out the Bay of Pigs and maybe getting back into

Chase then said, Bundy wanted a chronological memo about
the entire thing. I might say I age forgotten one point. When
I first told Adlai Stevenson about this demarche-or: approach
by the Cubans he said he liked it, but, and I quote, he said
the CIA, unfortunately, is still in charge of Cuba. But he
said -- he still offered to take it up with the White House.

Anyway, we're now on November 12th, and I went to Miss
Howard's apartment where she said he had set up a phone call to
Havanna with Valao. We never could get through the bad
connections, but she had spoken to him before I arrived and
he had suggested that I come to Marianao from Key West and
talk directly with Fidel Castro, because they wanted to avoid
going, through Havanna.

Bundy called me the same day to say that the White House
favored preliminary talks with Valao at tha UN but not down in
Cuba and told me to tell Valao this. I finally reached Valao
on the telephone on November the 14th and delivered a message
about his. coming here. He said -- and that we wanted to discuss
agenda.

He said he would send instructions to LaChuga and that he
would -- or rather Castro, through him, to LaChuga, that they

should discuss an agenda with me. He was very cordial on the

telephone.

we referred to our talk in '59.and he said another talk might

be possible and useful at this time, and that was the first real
indication. At this point, I said I'm-no longer a private
citizen but a government official and we agreed that the
current situation was different, at the same time, things were

a bit abnormal and he said the Cubans were very much annoyed at

the exile rate, the CIA rate on Cuba, as well as the freezing
of their assets.

The next step was my visit to Washington on September 24th
when I came down to see Robert Kennedy who was then Attorney
General. His position was -- I showed him the memoranda, which
I had prepared on what had happened up to that point. He said
that a trip to Cuba which is what LaChuga had suggested would
be rather risky; Perea bound to leak and said it might

result in some kind of Congressional investigation or something.

Anyway, it might be a problem. But he did think the matter was

worth pursuing through UN. channels, and he would be talking to

Averell Harriman and Bundy about it.
At that point, LaChuga said he would be making a very

violently anti-American speech on November 7th and not to worry

too. much about it, so Stevenson asked me to help prepare a spee

in raply. On the 27th of September, I saw Lochuga again, told h

I could not aecept any invitation to come to Cuba, but I would

anyone who wanted to come up and h

I reported this to Bundy on the 19th of November -- by the
i

way, my call to Valaoiwas the 18th -- he said that after their

agenda had been receivéd, the President wanted to see me at the

White House and decide /|what to say and whether to go or what

we should do next. That was the 19th of November, three days

before the assassination.

On the 29th of November, LaChuga had »seen’: Miss Howard
and he wondered where things stood now. I passed the word to
him that I didn't know, but that until we were told differently
that we would continue our conversation.

On the 2nd of December he confirmed. getting a letter from
Valao and he wanted to know if a.things had changed aqain. He
said he was authorized to talk to me in general terms.

I called the White: House, Chase in this case, to say that
the ball was now in our court.

On December 4th, raChuga again looked me up at the UN,”
said he now had a lettar directly from Castro approving the
detailed talks and an agenda. Again, I informed Chase.

He said the decision would take some time now because all
our policies were under review.

This went on. I kept seeing LaChuga and LaChuga would say
he was waiting for an answer, and I kapt saying well the door
isn't closed, I just don't know.

- From: Mason Cargill “y~

Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS RELATING

On May 20, 1975, I reviewed one file of documents
in the office of the Assistant Attorney General/Criminal
Division. The file was about one-half inch thick, was marked
"#82-46-5 - TOP SECRET." It contained documents relating to
the October 31, 1960, wiretapping incident in Las Vegas.

fhe documents in this file indicated the following
items of interest:

1. The IRS investigated Rosselli from December 1, 1962, to
March 1, 1963.

2. IRS report attached to March 19, 1963, memo to Herbert J.
Miller, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
indicates Maheu told FBI that Rowan tap had been placed
to determine whether McGuire had leaked any classified
information she had obtained from Giancana.

3. Letter from Miller (Assistant Attorney General) to U.S.
Attorney in Las Vegas of January 17, 1963, instructed ~
that prosecution of Balletti should be dropped.

4, Memo for the Record, dated May 14, 1962, Subject: Arthur
James Balletti et al - Unauthorized Publication or Use of

Memo _to Attorney General, from Herbert J. Miller, of
April 24, 1962, Subject: Arthur James Balletti - Wiretap
Case ~ Sam Giancana - This memo recommends prosecution in
this case would be against national interest. It contains
no mention of assassination.

The file contained several memos to and from FBI Director
and Miller of January, February, and March, 1962, re
Las Vegas case. They did not mention assassination.

Other Department of Justice documents of December 1961,
relating to possible prosecution were filed. They basically
outlined facts of the Balletti matter.

FBI reports on Las Vegas incident, dated September 12,
1961, August 18, 1961, and July 28, 1961... The last one
indicated Maheu installed bug to determine whether
Giancana had leaked classified information to McGuire.

There follow several FBI reports on interview during 1961
of participants in the Las Vegas incident.

Memo from Director of FBI to Attorney General, of May 22,
i961, transmits the memo dated May 22, 1961, of an inter-
view with Shef Edwards of May 3, 1961. [We have copy of

the memo on this interview, dated May 22, 1961, Subject:

"Arthur James Balletti, et al."]

FBI report (April 20, 1961) of interview with Maheu.

It indicates Maheu said he ordered bug to determine if
Giancana or McGuire were leaking information.

There follow many FBI documents in 1961 on investigation
of details of preparation, etc., for Las Vegas affair.

Memo, dated November 22, 1960, to Assistant Attorney
General (Criminal Division), from Director of FBI,

Subject: Arthur James Balletti, Unauthorized Publication
or Use of Communications transmitted a report of an FBI
agent at Salt Lake City dated November 10, 1960. The
agent's report stated that Balletti was arrested on
October 31, 1960, at the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas. This
report contains the details of the arrest.

(This document is the last Entry in this Criminal Division
file on the Las Vegas Incident.)

14. Documents from late 1960's and early 1961 indicate Maheu
did not implicate CIA initially but instead said he had
been asked by a Los Angeles attorney to arrange investi-
gative work in Las Vegas. Maheu declined to name the
attorney.

Maheu first mentioned CIA connection in an FBI interview
on April 18, 1961 [after the Bay of Pigs] (detailed in an
agent report of April 20, 1961, transmitted by a memo to
Assistant Attorney General on April 25, 1961). He said
he was working with CIA and the Las Vegas bug was ordered
to determine if Sam Giancana was leaking information.
(Maheu did not tell FBI about nature of activities he
undertook for CIA.)

the abortive rebel invasion at

An equally bizarre episode
months fater gave the Justice
Department its first clue to
Giancana’s negotiations with
the CIA,

The figures in this incident
were a male night-club enters
tainer and Giancana’s girl
friend, Phyllis McGuire, one of
the singing McGuire sisters.

At the time, in Giancana’s
opinion, the entertainer was
overly attentive to Miss Me-
Guire,

At Las Vegas, Nev., in 1961,
heriff's police seized a prowler
in the entertainer’s hotel suite.
For hours, the intruder refused
to identify himself or say he
was rifling the entertainer’s
rooms.

sheriffs deputies, according to
federal authorities, Ied to an
admission by the prowler that

he was on the payroll of a pri-

MEMORANDUM !
To: File
Ae
From: Mason Cargill he

Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS

On the afternoon of May 20, 1975, I briefly
examined the Justice Department Files on the Kennedy assassi-
nation, ranging from February 18, 1969, to January 28, 1971.
According to Mr. Keeney and his secretary who has reviewed
these files in detail, they contain no memo from any State
Department employee who was in Mexico in 1963. Basically these
files consist of letters from citizens, some referred from
congressmen, and press clippings relating to the assassination.

Mr. Keéeney's secretary referred me to several
entries in these files respecting allegations by people who
claimed to have been involved in the Kennedy assassination.
One claimed to have been a CIA agent. There are also many
letters from assassination "nuts." Other documents relate
to court proceedings to force FBI agents to testify in the
Clay Shaw trial in Louisiana.

One document: is an FBI report, dated February 2,
1972, stating that one Richard von Kleist had contacted the
FBI claiming he had information on. the John F. Kennedy :
assassination. Kleist claimed certain people conspired in
the Hotel Luna, Mexico City, in July, 1963. Kleist was not
a State Department employee. He appeared to be a free-lance
magazine writer. : 7

Ve
‘that before looking at the FBI as to possible "leaks, ' he should carefully examine his
own house. I told him I wag quite thoroughly familiar with ‘the way Guthman and
.-Rosenthal dealt with the press and that as he well knew the wire service people stayed
‘constantly in Guthman's private office.; I told him it was quite obvious to me how the
AP had learned that the report had been sent over to the Department.

Katzenbach reiterated that he had no complaints against the FBI. He
stated again that the purpose of his call was to tell me about Senator Russell's feelings,

He added that he had another reason for calling and that was to determine
if we could give him any ideas as to how Warren Olney could be dropped as Chief
Counsel of*the Presidential Commission. I told Katzenbach of our feelings concerning

‘Olney. He. stated that‘ne was presently working through Congressman Hale Boggs and
ihe thought he was going to pe successful in getting Olney's name removed from
consideration. He told me that Boggs was very sympathetic.

Katzenbach mentioned that Waggoner Carr, the Texas State Attorney
!General, would like very much to see the Director on Friday, 12-6-63. Iasked him
what for. He stated that Carr had no'particular motive in mind other than to indicate
to the press later on that he had discussed matters with the Director. I told him I could
see no percentage in the Director's seeing Carr, that we were the investigative

agency and that Carr's dealings should be with the Department and the Presidential
Commission. Katzenbach indicated that the,White House might think otherwise. He
stated that the President _was most anxious for Carr to be given attention in Washington
inasmuch as Cayr was running for < ext. year.” I told Katzenbach I knew this,
however, Tstill felt that the Director should not be injected into this matter.

Katzenbach stated he would attempt to disuadé Carr from seeing the Director, however,
Carr was quite persistent, a

ACTION:
Ty view of the close friendship which Carr obviously has with the

President, the Director may desire to just shake hands with Carr without sitting down

and discussing facts concerning our report. : {

: While atthe offices of the President's Commission on other eee
‘matters, J. Lee Rankin requested ‘Malley to stop’ by his office.. Mr. Rankin <'»7/

\advised that he desired’ to make it known that the Bureau had been of tremen-

|dous help to the President's Comission, that an e reneLy large volwie of
‘work had been produced by the Bureau and that the Burcau had been most
cooperative in handling all requests which had been made by the President's
Commission. : : : - Qi

~—. - He commented that recently there had been quite an increase in the vos,
number of requests and there was a possibility that there would be many more |
; additional requests. Mr, Rankin’ stated this was not intended as a criticisu »
‘of the Bureau's work but instead was the following through of the Commis-
sion's desire-to complete the Comission's recor and leave no unanswered
\ yuestions. ae

In this. regard, Mr. Rankin went on to say that the Bureau, in:
conducting its investigation, had an extremely difficult and enormous tusk
to perform and that he as we 1 as other members of the Commission staff had
been amazed at the amount of detailed information which had been developed
by the Bureau in its investigation, Ie commented that the Commission in
performing its tasks was of necessity making a most minute study of the ~

Hl Bureau's work as well as that of: other Goverment agencies with the idea of
\jpicking the investigation to pieces to the extreme degree so that wherever
vit was ossible to clarify any item, this could be handled while the , -

{ Commission was in existence. ! ‘

: Mr, Rankin advised that in connection with the letter which had
just recently been transmitted to the Bureau requesting an explanation con- H
cerning information relative to Special Agent Janes P. Hosty's name being Hl
omitted from a report prepared in the Dallas Office (report of Special Agent: i
Robert P. Gemberling dated 12/23/63), he wanted the Bureau to know the :

én Extract From Kennedy's Address to Press’

Washington Post, Tuesday, November 19, 1963, p. Al5

(AP). Nov. 18 -- The following is a text of President Kennedy's address
tonight before the Inter-American Press Association:

(* * *
"The genuine Cuban revolution -- because it was against the tyran-
ny and corruption of the past -- had the support of many whose aims and

concepts were noble.
"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed.
"The goals proclaimed! in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana.

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my country
and from all the American |countries: It is the fact that a small band
of conspirators has stripped the Cuban people of their freedom and hand-
ed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces
beyond the hemisphere. Tiley have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial-
ism, an instrument of the policy of others, a weapon in an effort dic-
tated by external powers to’ subvert the other American republics. This,
and this alone divides us: As long as this is true nothing is possible.
Without it everything is possible.
Li

Ready and Anxious

"Once this barrier is: removed we will be ready and anxious to work
with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which, a few
short years ago, stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people
throughout the entire hemilsphere.

"No Cuban need feel trapped between dependence on the broken prom-
ises of foreign communism |and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere.
For once Cuban sovereignty, has been restored we will extend the hand of
friendship and assistance.|to a Cuba whose political and economic insti-
tutions have been shaped by the will of the Cuban people."

Last week in these pages | auswered the first question by describing the re-
actions of Fidel Castro, with whom t twas visiting at the time, to John Ken-
nedy’s death. Here I shall explére the second question by reconstituting the

Kennedy-Castro dialogue from ith
{

Na

President Kennedy received me at the White House
on Thursday, October 24. My appointment had been
scheduled for s:30. I waited in the Cabinet Conference

“oom, and at 5:45 the President, following his usual
custom, came to look for me himself so that he: could
escort me into his office. He apologized for the delay,
not so much as a courtesy or to flatter me, but to ex-
lain the scheduling of his time, which seemed to be
very strictly organized, As we passed through the small
room where his secretary was working, we'catight a
glimpse of Mrs. Kennedy leaving by a French window
on ker way to the private garden of the White House.
The President called her back tu introduce me.

“Ir was still Indian summer in Washington.i The
weather was very warm, and both the President and
Mrs Kennedy were very lightly dressed, thus enhane-
ing the impression of youth, charm, and simplicity
whi. h was in rather surprising contrast to the solemnity
of entering these august chambers.. The President
(athletic looking in his well-tailored suit, speaking:with
quick, abrupt gestures and a mobile expression but, at
times, freezing up and becoming disconcertingly, al-
mort, | would say, completely expressionless) invited
me to be seated on the semi-circular sofa which was in
the middle of his office. He sat ina rocking chair op-
posite the sofa. The interview was to last from.20 to
minutes, and it was interrupted only by a brief. tele-
phone call.

The President immediately asked me how the French
situation was developing. After my reply, h¢ spoke
akout General de Gaglle. He talked in a relaxed fashion,

Tie AUTHOR

like someone who has at last found solace in indiffer-
ence after having long been exasperated and fascinated.
John Kennedy was a man who liked to get to the heart
of.a matter quickly, “Siab-make decisions even more
rapidly. But this was not possible in dealing with de
Gaulle, who is more difficult to handle than Khru-
shchev. One day, impatient at not understanding the
General’s reasoning and intent upon convincing him,
Kennedy telephoned de Gaulle direct. All in’ vain. Odd-
ly enough, however; since the recent visit of de Gaulle’s
foreign minister, Couve de Murvil'e, to Washington
Mr. Kennedy had ceased to be so deeply concerned
about Franco-American relations. The truth is, he had
made up his mind not to worry about them any more.
According to him, it was a waste of time.

“Mr. Couve de Marville and J both verified that we
didn’t agree on anything,” the President told me. “And
we agreed thatsuch total disagreement was hardly cal-
culated to create a flourishing friendship between two
great Western nations. I came to the conclusion that
General de Gaulle’s strategy, which is ‘tather incom-
prehensible to me, requires a certain amount of tension
with the United States. It would seem that only through
this tension is it possible to restore to Europé the desire
to, think for itself and renounce its torpid dependence
on American dollar aid and political guidance!”

President Kennedy went on to sum@up, Meith con-
ciseness and vigor, the points of disazre t between
the United States and France. On the cul igct of Ger-
many, nuclear policy, Europe. the leXvof “indepen-

knowledge. He added, however, that France had
strange way of manifesting its independence, part.-
ularly, for example, on the subject of j:Vietnam
Cuba. It seemed ironic and irritating to, him that the
French Chief Executive was apparently bent on telling
him how the Unised States should progecd, without
assuming any risks himself. Fle told me what no one was
more appreciative than he of advice, in formation, and
even criticism; but that these were all the more valued
if the friends proffering them were themselves com-
mitted to a program of action.

I then asked Mr. Kennedy what could be expected
from General de Gaulle’s proposed I vigit|to the United
States next February. He replied: “ “Absolutely nothing.”
But he followed this up immediately and with a broad
grin, as though savoring in advance the pleasure of
the impending meeting: “It will be exciting, just the
same. General de Gaulle is an historic figure; he is de-
cidely the strangest great man of our |time.”

and

Relations with Cuba |

Taking the initiative at this point, T brought up the
subject of Vietnam and Cuba, saying that the Gaullists
were not the only ones in France who deplored certain
mistaken US policies. I pointed out that the first time
T had the opportunity of mecting John Kennedy, he
was a Senator and had just made a redounding speech
on the subject of Algeria. 7¥&the ideas set forth in
that speech been faithfully applied in Saigon and
Havana? Here my notes are very specific, and I shall
let the late President speak through them:

“We haven't enough time to talk | spout Vietnam,
but I'd like to talk to you about Cuba. Incidentally, our
conversation will be much more interesting when you
return, because Ben Bradlee [of Newsiveck] tells me
you are on your way to Cuba now. i

“Every now and then T read articles in the European
press pointing out that we Americans! jwere blind to
what was happening in the Cuban situation, Thave just
learned that General de Gaulle himself regarded’ Com-
munism in Cuba as nothing but the) Kecidental and
temporary form of a will to independence from the
United States. Of course it is very easy] to understand
this ‘will to independence’ around President de Gaulle.”

John Kennedy then mustered all his persuasive force.

ical gesture which had. become famous;

sions go much further than the European analyses. Here

“T believe that there is no country in the world, in-
cluding all the African regions, WKluding any and all
the countries under colonial domination, where eco-
nomic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were
worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's
policies during the Batista regime. | believe that we
created, built and manufactured the Castro movement
out of whole cloth and without realizing it. I believe
that the accumulation of these mistakes has jeopardized
all of Latin America. The great aim of the Alliance for
Progress is to reverse this unfortunate policy. This is
‘one of the most, if not the most, important problems in
American foreign policy. [can assure you that I have
understood the Cubans. I approved the proclamation
which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when
he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to
rid Cuba of corruption. I will go even further: to some
extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a
number of sins on the part of the United States. Now
we'shall have to pay for those.sins. In the matter of the
Batista regime, [ am in agreement with the first Cuban
revolutionaries. That is perfectly clear.”

After a silence during which he was able to note my
surprise and my interest, the President continued: ‘But
it is also clear ‘that the problem has ceased to be a
Cuban one, and has become international — that is, it
has become a Soviet problem. I am the President of the
United States and not a sociologist; 1 am the President
of a free nation which has certain responsibilities in the
Free World. I know that Castro betrayed the promises
made.in the Sierra Maestra, and that he has agreed to
be a Soviet agent in Latin America. I know that through
his fault -either his ‘will to independence’, his snad-
ness or Communism — the world was on the verze of
nuclear war in October, 1962. The Russians understood
this very well, at least after our reaction; but.so far as
Fidel Castro is concerned, | must say I don’t know
whether he realizes this, or even if he cares about it.”
A smile, then: “You'can tell me whether he does when
you come back. In any case, the nations of Latin Amer-
‘ica are no& going to attain justice and progress, ‘that
way, I mean through Communist subversion.’ They
won't get there by going from economic oppressin to
4 Marxist dictatorship which Castro himself denounced
a few years ago. The United States now has tHe. pos-
sibility of doing as much good in Latin Ameri
has done wrong in the past; I would even say
alone have this power - on the essential condition
Communism does not take over there.”

Mr. Kennedy then rose'to indicate fat the
was over. I apologized for keeping him td

MEMORANDUM

To: Files af

From: Mike nacieel lll ee
Date: June 30, 1975

Subj: - Committee Cont. with Sam Giancana

i
To my knowledge the Committee's first contact with Sam

Giancana occurred on June 9, 1974, when Patrick Shea of the

Committee staff received a'telephone communication from

Robert Bennett, Assistant ‘District Attorney, Houston, Texas.

It is my information from jtalking to Mr. Shea that Mr. Bennett

called the Committee to advise that Sam Giancana was admitted —
jt

“which was located at 6515 Bertner

to the Methodist, Hospital
Street in Houston, Texas. |\Mr. Bennett's information was that

Giancana was admitted to Room 402 of the Hospital under the

care of a Dr. Debakey. Mr,

| Bennett also advised that Giancana
was there for a gall bladder removal operation. I believe, al-
though I am not positive, that Bennett also advised that

Giancana was then under. surveillance. My recollection at this

time is not clear as to whether Bennett advised as to which

agency or organization hadi Giancana under surveillance, but my

impression is that it was mot the F.B.I.

At about the time of this communication from Bennett, I, as

i
Committee Counsel, had been attempting to locate Mr. Giancana.

ra

After the initial phone call from Bennett to Shea, I
telephoned Bennett on two'different occasions. My telephone
contact with. Bennett was for the purpose of our locating
Giancana and a telephone number at which I could reach him.
Bennett initially indicated to me, as described earlier in
this memorandum, that Giancana was in the hospital. My recol-
lection is that on my second telephone call with Bennett, he
informed me that Giancana was now out of the hospital and
staying at the Warwick Hotel. Finally, I recall calling the
Methodist Hospital in Houston and asking to speak to Mr.
Giancana. I recall that the hospital authorities indicated
that they had no such person by that name in the hospital.

I do not recall the precise date of this telephone communication
to the hospital. It is my: recollection that the name used by
Giancana was Doc Brown. iam uncertain whether Bennett told me
Giancana was using "Doc Brown" at both the hospital and the
hotel, but I believe he said that the alias was used at the

hospital. Bennett advised. that Giancana had been visited by

several relatives.and gave’ me the names of amuple of persons

In either the seconk

with Bennett, he told me)‘that Giancana had now. checked out
of the hotel and was either on his way back to his home in
Qak Park, Illinois, or with his daughter in California. He eta
provided me with the telephone number of the daughter in
California and suggested I obtain Giancana's home number from
the information directory in Illinois. ;
The telephone conversations with Bennett occurred, to
the best of my recollection, during the wéek of June 16, 1975S.
It is possible, however, ‘that the first conversation occurred

later in the week of June 9. It is my recollectimthat my

second telephone conversation with Bennett occurred on Thurs-

day June 19. In any event, I am certain that I attempted to- oe
contact Giancana by telephone on Thursday, June 19. I was

unable to get anyone to answer the telephone in California

and did not have an opportunity to attempt to obtain the

Illinois number. I learned Friday, June 20 that Giancana had

been shot and killed in his home in Oak Park, Illinois on

the evening of June 19.

Slain Mobster Claimed

Cubani Link to JFK Death

By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern

‘Washington Post Staff Writers

Long before his recent murder,
John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in‘retali-
,ation, were involved in the assassina-

ion of President John F. Kennedy.

‘  Rosselli's belief in a-Cuban connec-
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
sexpressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long
ago as March, 1967, and also in private
.conversations with a longtime associ-
ate of Rosselli who participated in
mectings between Rosselli ‘and the
CIA. ’

an FBI “blind memorandum” on
an interview with Morgan : dated
March 21, 1967, was included, without

identification of the interviewee, in
last June’s Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee's report on the role of the in-
telligence community in the Kennedy
assassination investigation.

Morgan told -the FBI that Rosselli
and another Morgan client had in-
formed him that Castro became aware
of CIA assassination conspiracies
against him and “thereafter employed
teams of individuals who were dis-
patched to the United States for the

purpose of assassinating Mri Ken

neds.”
Because neither. Morgan nor Ros-
selli was’ identified in the Senate re-

port, the significance of that portion '

of the 106-page document was dis-

in June, before, Rosselli's disappear-

ance and the subsequent discovery of
his body in an oil drum in Florida
waters. The Washington Post,.however,
has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli
. were the sources of the testimony, that
suggested a Cuban role in:,the Ken-
nedy murder. a

Morgan’s account, according; to .a
summary of the FBI interview, was
that Rosselli had reached his conclu-

sion about a Cuban connection: to the:

Kennedy assassination’ from

“feedback” furnished by sources close *

to Castro who were involved in the CIA
plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

Page 638

“His (Morgan's) clients were aware
of the identity of some of the individ-
uals who came to the United States
for this purpose and he understood
that two such individuals were now in
the state of New Jersey,” the FBI in-

, terview summary stated.

aa

A long-time associate. of Rosselli ~

who was interviewed separately * by
‘The Washington Post, said there was
sno questién in the slain mobster’s
imind that President Kennedy was
i killed on Castro's behalf in reprisal
“for the CIA schemes against the Cu-
ban leader.
“He was positive; he was sure.” said
, the associate, who knew Rosselli weil
and was in-contact with him before
Rosselli disappeared from his Florida
‘home on July 28. The associate, who
‘does not want to be identified pub-
slicly, is scheduled to be interviewed
i this week by Dade County. Fla.. homi-
cide detectives, He was a party to Ros-
selli’s contacts in the early 1960s with
CIA case Officers overseeing the .at-
tempts to assassinate Castro. ‘
Despite occasional speculation, the
collective conclusion of all official
U.S. government investigations into
the Kennedy assassination—including
the Warren Commission, the FBI and
the CIA—has been that there was no
evidence’ that implicated the Castro
‘ government or any of its agents.
However, the CIA's inyolvement in
the schemes to assassinate Castro
was not divulged to the Warren Com-
mission, and knowledge of them was
confined until 1967 to a small, elite
_ circle of the U.S. intelligence commu-
inity. President Johnson apparently
first learned about the schemes only
‘after a March 7, 1967, column by the
ilate Drew Person, which prompted

‘Johnson to order a CIA investigation

‘of the highly sensitive episode.
‘pull details of the CIA-underworld
collusion in the plots to kill Castro
did not surface publicly until the pub-
‘lication Jast year of the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee’s assassination re*
port and the ensuing report last June
_on the possible role of the intelligence:


HW 50955

agencies in the Kennedy assassination, ,

and investigation.

The body of Rosselli, who lived
flamboyantly in a world of mobsters,
politicians and playgirls, was found
two weeks ago in an inverted oil drum

,weighted with chains but buoyed ‘by,
igases from decomposition on the
‘ocean's surface off the coast of Miami,
The specific cause of death was deter-
mined by an autopsy to be asphyxiar
tion, /
. Last year, an underworld colleague
jof Rosselli, Sam (Momo) Giancana,
who also had been recruited. by the
-CIA in-the effort to kill Castro, was
‘found shot to death in his Chicago
home in what police described as a,
highly professional job by assailants!
who penetrated the mobster’s per-
‘sonal security screen. Giancana was
due to testify before the Senate Intel-
‘ligence Committee bilaed after his
‘demise.

Neither murder Ras a solved.
‘The possibility that Rosselli’s mur-
der might have been related to his
Senate testimony on the CIA schemes
to kill Castro has brought the FBI
into the investigation at the request
of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.

‘The involvement of Rosselli, Gian-
cana and other underworld figures—
principally Santos Trafficante of
‘Tampa, Fla., whose one-time Havana
gambling enterprises fell hostage in
1959 to the Cuban revolution—in plots
against Castro had been a closely held
secret within the top echelons of the
CIA and FBI until recently.

‘The tangled chronology of suppres-
sion and eventual disclosure, although
detailed in the June report, has re-
ceived little public attention. Rossel-
lis murder adds significance to those
events.

Here is the sequence, pieced to:
gether from the testimony given to
Senate intelligence investigators:

Columnist Drew Pearson went to

the late Chief Justice of ‘the United”

States Earl Warren late in.: January,
1967. and told him that a Washington
lawyer had confided to him-that one
of his clients said the United States
“had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro.
had decided to retaliate.”

Warren declined Pearson's sugges-
tion that he see the lawyer, who was
Edward Morgan. Warren referred the
matter to then Secret Service Direc-
tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,
1967, wrote.FBI Director J. Edgar Ho-
over, informing him of the allegations.

DocId:32423630 Page 639

> Hoover scnt the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an “eyes-
only” basis. There is no record of FBI
meetings or discussions of those alle-

j]gations. At Lhat point the sensitive let-

ter bounced back and forth’in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-
jracy.

; The job of responding, to Rowley’s
letter was assigned to the supervisor
of the FBI’s General Investigative Di-
vision who was given responsiility for
the overall assassination investigation
in March 1964.

This official's job was complicated
by the fact that he had never been in-

*. formed of what Hoover and his closest

+! early in

circle of confidants in the FBI learned

deeply involved in assassination

.-altempts against Castro, and promi-

nent American underworld figures, in-
cluding Rosselli and Giancana, had

been recruited for the attempts. FE
‘ So on Feb. 15, 1967, the FBI official,
prepared a draft reply to the Rowley~

letter for his superiors saying “our in-

‘--vestigation uncovered no evidence in-

~ read this .

dicating Fidel Castro officials of the
Cuban Goverpment were involved
-with-Lee Harvey Oswald in the assas-
sination of President Kennedy. This
“bureau is not conducting any investi-
gation regarding this matter.” ‘The
BI official added in later testimony,
that “everyone in ‘the higher echelons

Drew Pearson went ahead and pub-
lished a column on March 7, 1967, ref-
erring to reports that CIA schemes
against Castro's life in 1963 “may

* have resulted in a counterplot by Cas-

tro to assassinate President Kenne-
dy.”

Ten days later, Marvin Watson. one
of Lyndon Johnson's chief deputies,
called FBI. assistant director Cartha
DeLoach with the message that “the
President had instructed that the FBI
interview (Morgan) concerning any
knowledge he might have’ regarding
the assassination of President Ken:
nedy.”

DeLoach told Watson, that it “ap-
peared Morgan “did not want to be in-
terviewed, and even if he was inter-
viewed he would probably not divulge
the identity of his sources . ..” Wat-
son persisted, however. :

“Under the cireumstances,” De-
Loach concluded in. a memo for the.
files. “it appears that we have no al-
ternative but to interview (Morgan)
and then furnish the results to Wat.
son in blind memorandum form.”

The interview was assigned to two
agents from the FBI's General Investi-
gative Division, which the Senate

ig62—that the CIA was’

committee concluded was “puzzling™
because it was the Domestic Intelli-
gence Division which had heen as-
signed responsibility for investigating
possible foréign involvement in the
assassination.

Neither agent was privy to the
knowledge, confined to Hoover and
his top aides, of the CIA's assassina-
tion plots against,Castro. Both agents
testified eight years later that they
were “surprised” when Morgan al-
luded during the interview to US. at-
tempts to assassinate Castro.

“These agents stated that they

could not evaluate the lawyer's
(Morgan’s) allegations or question him
in detail on them, since they had not
been briefed-on the CIA assassination
efforts,” the Senate committee ob-
served,
« On March 21, 1967, the FBI's Wash-
ington Field Office sent headquarters
ten copies of a blind memorandum
summarizing the interview with Mor-
gan.

Ina Senate Intelligence Committee
summary of the FBI interview, Mor-

* gan was reported to” have acknowi- .

edged that his clients were “on the
fringe of the underworld” and that
they faced “possible prosecution in a
crime not related to the assassination

Morgan said his clients “were called
upon by a governmental agency to as-
sist in a project which was said to
have the highest governmental ap-
proval. The project had as its purpose
the assassination of Fidel Castro.
Elaborate plans were made. including
the infiltration of the Cuban Govern-
ment and the placing of informants
within key posts in Cuba.”

Morgan also told the FBI, according
to the summary, that Castro had em-
ployed “teams ‘of individuals who
were dispatched to the United States.
for the purpose of assassinating Presi-

: dent Kennedy.” H

it was not clear then—nor is it to”
day—why Morgan‘ came forward at *
that time to bring’ Rosselli’s story to
the ears of the nation’s highest law,
enforcement authorities.

Tt may be relevant that Rosselli had’
‘serious legal problems at the time.

In May, 1966, the FBI. threatened to
deport him for living in the United
States tinder an assumed name unless
he cooperated in an investigation of
the Mafia (his true riame was ippo
Saco). At the time, he reached’ a CIA
contact from the anti-Castdo conspir-
acy days, CIA security director Col.

__ Sheffield Edwards, who informed the


HW 50955

FBI that Rosselli wanted’ to “keep -
square with the bureay” but was .
afraid that the mob might kill him tor
talking.

In 1967, after he was-arrested “for
gambling fraud at the Friars Club! in.
Beverly Hills, Rosselli approached his”
former CIA case’ officer, William Har:
vey. who sought unsuccessfully fo in:
tercede in the prosecution. ;

It was against this background that
Morgan went, first to. Drew Pearson, ?
and then the FBI, with ,Rossélli’s sen-
sational allegations of” CIA plotting
against Castro and the Cuban counter-
espionage directed against President ;
Kennedy.

Last April. Rosselli told the Senate
Intelligence Committee te had no rec-
collection. of either receiving informa.
tion that Castro retaliated against

i
heel
President Kennedy or of: having dis 4

i

cussed it with Morgan. This meant ei-
ther that Rosselli suffered a dramatic
memory loss or that Morgan's state- ~
ment to FBI agents nine years earlier
was a pure invention, a serious risk
for an established Washington lawyer.

No committee source could explain
the discrepancy, and Morgan declined
to confirm that Rosselli was the client
in question or to discuss either his
allegations against the Cuban govern-
ment or his recent testimony.

‘The internal FBI memo on the 1967
interview with ‘Morgan was sent, to
headquarters with a transmittal slip
saying: “No Curther ‘investigation is
being conducted. by the Washington
field office unless it is advised to the
contrary by the Bureau.”

The Senate intelligence committee,
in commenting on this position, said
that “had the interviewing agents
known’ of the CIA-underworld plots
against Castro, they would have been
aware that the lawyer had clients who-

, had been active in the assassination

plots.”

On March 21, _ headquarters for-
warded the Washington field office
memo to the White House the attor-
ney general and.the Secret Service,,It
did not recommend any further in-
vestigation of Morgan’s allegations.

On the evening of the following
day, President Johnson called CIA Di-
rector Richard M. Helms to‘the White
House. The next morning, March 23,
Helms ordered the CIA inspector gen-
cral to prepare a report on the CIA
involvement in the assassination plots ;
—Operation | Mongoose—of which i
Helms had full knowledge at the tithe
they were executed..." -1"

By May 22, Helms briefed President,
Johnson on the results. There is, how-*
ever, no evidence that Helms briefed
the President on the November, 1963, |
plot—one of eight major schemes on :

eryptonymn AMLASH. His identity
was revealed as Rolando Cubela, a
1961 CIA “recruit” with close access
to Castro.

'CIA operatives turned over assassi-
inationequipment to Cubela during a
* Paris meeting on November 22, 1963—*
j-the day President Kennedy was killed

E | Within the past year, Rosselli: and
1 two of his co-conspirators in the Cas-
{.tfo assassination schemes have died,
"Giancana al the hands of a profes:
| sional hit man and Harvey as the re-
| Sult ‘of a “massive heart attack” last
i Sune. :
! | Mrs. Williain Harvey, the widow of
the deceased. CIA / official, said she
| suspected no foul play in her hus-
[band’s death. She did, however, tell

The Washington Post that she re-
| ceived a call after Rosselli’s disappear-
““dnce in late July warning her that Cu-
bans appeared to be attempting to
wipe out all those who participated in
j the anti-Castro plots,

The call, she said, came from an old
friend who was acquainted with Ros-
} sellits sister, whose name is Edith Dai-
gle. Mrs, Harvey said that Mrs. Daigle
‘told the mutual acquaintance that the
| Rosselli family had received a tele-
| phone threat from unidentified Cu-
bans prior to Rosselli's disappearance.
! She also said that Rosselli had gone to
meet the Cubans in an effort to pro-
tect his family.

Mrs. Daigle could not be reached by
The Washington Post. But another sis-
‘ter of Rosselli said she had heard of

i_ No such threats or warnings.

Harvey, who died at age 60 and
“whose exploits as a clandestine opera-
; tor are both legendary and controver-

“t sial within the agency, testified to the
Senate Intelligence Committee. He
had become Rosselli's case officer in
Operation Mongoose and supplied the
mobster with poison pills, explosives,
detonators, rifles, handguns, radios.
and boat radar for transmission to!

anti-Castro Cuban agents. Harvey and, *
“Rosselli, a CIA superior testified to

the Senate committee, “developed a
© close friendship”. ~

Another CIA official who worked
with Rosselli, James'R. O'Connell, was
asked if he knew whelhet the agency

: transmitted information/to the mob-
ster on possible Cuban Involvement in
! the Kennedy assassination. He replied
that he was out of‘ the gountry at the
time Kennedy was killed, and had no
; further comment. © |. /\
«Two months before the’ Kennedy as-
sassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, who.
was identified by the Watren Commis-
; sion.as Kennedy’s mufderer, had trav-
eled to Mexico City''in an attempt to
gain entry to Cuba. According to the
Warren Commission, Oswald repre-
sented himself as the head of the New
Orleans branch of the Fair Play for
Cuba organization and a friend of the
Cuban Revolution.

Some three months before Kennedy
was killed, Castro told Associated
Press reporter Daniel Harker that
USS. leaders aiding terrorist plans to
eliminate Cuban leaders would them-
selves not be safe.:

AUS. government committee coor-
dinating policy toward Cuba at the

+, time agreed there is a strong liklihood
that Castro would retaliate in some
fashion. However, it concluded Castro
would not risk 4 major confrontation
with the U;S. by attacking U.S. lead-
ers.

On the same Way Kennedy was as-
sassinated, a CIA officer met with a
high-ranking Cuban official, who had
said he would kill Castro, to tell him
the U.S. Would provide him with ex-
plosives and a poison pen device.

While the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee said it found no evidence suffi-
cient to justify a conclusion that the
Kennedy assassination was part of a
conspiracy, it also said U.S. ‘agencies
did not properly investigate the assas-
sination or tell the Warren Commis-
son about the CIA plots on Castro's
ife.

“There is no indication that the FB
or the CIA directed the interviewing
of Cuban sources or sources within
the Cuban exile community,” the Sen-
ate committee said.

According to a former FBI official
in charge of key aspects of the FBI's
probe of the Kennedy murder.. the
FBI, never satisfactorily determined
what Oswald planned to do in Cuba or
what he had done in Russia. .

MEMORANDUM.

TO: FRITZ AND BILL
FROM: MIKE EPSTEIN
DATE: JUNE 20, 1975

SUBJECT: GIANCANA

I expect that no one will write off the alleged Giancana murder as a

“third-rate homicide," and that.it will grow and grow and grow.. It is clearly

the most volatile media issue of the season.

Given the barest outlines of what allegedly happened, and taking them
at face value, we have a responsibility to take action under 18 U.S. Code,
Section 1505:

Whoever ... by Le. force «+. endeavors to . impede any

witness ... in connection with any inquiry or investigation
being had by ... any committee of either House ... or

‘ Whoever ... by ... force ... obstructs, or impedes or
endeavors to ... obstruct, or impede ... the due and proper
exercise of the ‘power of inquiry under which such inquiry

7 or ‘investigation is being had by ... any committee of

: either. House ...

Shall be fined not: more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more
than five years, or both.

In short, if Giancana was a "witness" (which status he might have
achieved by mere location contacts made by staff) and he was killed to
prevent his appearence; or indeed even if he wasn't yet a "witness" but
this was a "message" to eli witnesses to keep quiet (e.g. Roselli and Maheu),
there is a violation of law which we might have the responsibility to investigate.
Beyond ilies our responsibility is, it seems clear to me that most extreme

possibilities of what might actually have happened dictate that we come up

with a well-reasoned position and plan -- after careful, deliberate, intensive
j

BW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 643


.2-

consideration of all avenues/of approach, pitfalls, suspected motives, etc.

Most important of all, it bebis to me, is our acceptance of the fact that
: maybe we don't even have anyone on our staff with sufficient experience,

sophistication, background,. and investigative maturity to deal with this

situation.

As a first step, I urgeiyour decision to convene a planning session to
decide what the second step will be.

I can't emphasize enough the need for well-thought-out planning here.
Who knows where this will lead? And at a minimum, some months from now,
Senator Church may be asked,: "What did you do the day after you learned
that’ Giancena hed been Killeat" * :

My stream of consciousness on kinds of things to consider would
include: What our public statement on this should or should not be,
security for other witnesses, immediate contact with other key witnesses
(to reassure them), secrecy of witness lists and immunity applicetions,
secrecy of place, time and even fact of interview, meetings with Justice
organized crime section, Chicago strike force, local law enforcement people
in Oak Park. and Illinois, obtaining all FBI investigative reports (they're
in it per tonight's-Star), getting background on all law enforcement officials
in Illinois who will be involved. (whom do you trust?), is this a diversion
which we're being sucked into, how do we avoid that (hire someone just for
this), how do we show we care so other witnesses (known or unknown) won't

dry up, ete. etc. etc.

NOTE: . Mike can be reached efter 6:45 tonight at (802) 863-2652.

MEMORANDUM:

TO: Mike Madigan

FROM: Ed Greissing ;

DATE: August 13, 1976 ae

SUBJECT: Mention of Carlos Marcello in the 4/23/76 transcript of
John Rosselli. re

On April 23, 1976 during Mr. Rosselli's appearance before the
Schweiker-Hart Subcommittee, we'took the opportunity to question
him about any information he might possess regarding the New Orleans
Mafia Chieftan, Carlos Marcello. 7

Our interest in Marcello developed from 1).:the allegation that
Marcello was tangentially involved with both Clay Shaw and David
Ferrie; the fact that Marcello was deported by Attorney General Robert
Kennedy and that the assassination of President Kennedy was a possible
retaliation, iis

In my telephone conversation with Jim Johnston, 8/13/76, he could
think of no other reasons why we questioned Rosselli about Marcello.
If you would like to talk to Jim about this matter, his telephone
number is 780-6203.

from Roselli and Maheu indicating the use of a chef. The pills

were sent down and again returned when this plot failed.

O'Connell is unclear which of the aforementioned schemes took
place before the Bay of Pigs. He indicates, however, the use of

Varona to be after the Bay of Pigs.

O'Connell has the first introduction of Roselli and Harvey as

being in the Miami airport.

O'Connell's testimony is that he received a call from Maheu

who said that Giancana was upset about Phyllis MacGuire seeing

Dan Rowan. Maheu said that he had been requested to place a tap

for Giancana and that Giancana might "stop helping" on the assassina-
tion plot if this tap was not placed. O'Connell checked with
Edwards and received the go-ahead. O'Connell indicates that

Maheu was authorized to pay for DuBois out of the month given him

on the assassination plan.

. O'Connell states that’ he recalls November 1960 as the time

period of the delivery of the pills for Roselli through Trafficante?
O'Connell recollection that "chef" incident after Bay of Pigs.

O'Connell states that Varona's price was $50,000 -- $10,000

worth of communications equipment in addition.

O'Connell introduced by Roselli to Varona as "Mr. Olds."

Harvey Testimony

Harvey places the fall of 1961 as the time period in which
ZRRIFLE was to be applied to Cuba.

Harvey reference to pressure from the Kennedys to topple the
Castro regime clandestinely and not by means of any attack.

Roselli's hearsay knowledge of this?

Harvey states that he recalls firearms in the truck, possibly

“"sniper-scope rifles."

Harvey states that as soon as the missile crisis was over,
tt
i.e., late 1962, he indicated to Roselli that he wanted the
project cut off, although’ gradually so as not to create hard

feelings.

Roselli's knowledge of Greenspuy's safe -- break-in in 1971 --

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

7 I am writing you today on behalf of. the Select
Committee about thel recent death of Samuel Giancana. As
you are no doubt aware, his name has been raised in the
context of allegations concerning the Central Intelligence
Agency's possible involvement in so-called political
assassinations.

Based on information available to the Committee,
it was obvious thathe might be knowledgeable about the
political assassination matter. Although Mr. Giancana
had not actually been subpoenaed to testify by this Com-

?mittee, he had been approached by members of the staff

for a possible interview. Since this might involve viola-
tion of federal statutes pertaining to obstruction of a
Congressional Committee investigation, the Select Committee
is requesting that you instruct the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to keep it fully informed of all information
coming to the Bureau's attention pertaining to Mr. Giancana's

death. In making this request, the Committee is not conced-
ace

7 Ang its. right to conduct its own investigation of this
matter. However, it is acting in the spirit of cooperation
on a question of mutual concern to the Executive and Legis-

lative Branches of government.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 654


HW 50955 DocId

To :
i

The’ Committee 1s also concerned about the

safety of several other possible witnesses. Therefore,

we request 24-nour-a-day protection by the United States
Marshall Service for the following witnesses which the
Committee has subpoenaed, intends to subpoena, has inter-

viewed, or intends to interview:

(Alternative paragraph:

, The Committee is also concerned about the
safety of several other possible witnesses. We would
like to discuss with members of your staff the necessity
for special arrangements by the United States Marshall
Service to ensure the safety of witnesses who have. or
might have to contact with the Committee pertaining to

these matters.)

anotoriety greatly disproportionate to their numbers, because of their

continuous ‘activity in criminal and racketeering enterprises. ‘The

people of our city refer to this group as “the Sicilian underworld” or
‘the Mafia.”

Qur growing concern with this criminal group was crystallized in

1956 when s Hillsborough County grand jury was empaneled_ in

Tampa to investigate and determine the truth of allegations that

the Mafia was then operating in Tampa. ‘The pertinent part of that
= grand jury’sreport stated:

+ + © there are sime individuals who believe that a Mafia or Black Hand

's and operates in this community, but they are in the minority. * +

‘The evidence presented, the voluue of written material examined, aud wit-

nesses interviews poine fo the existence in this eominunity of an organized crite

element whose methods of operution are similar to the pattern of the Sicilian
Mafia as we understand it. ***

The Ciramsax, Chief, let me ask you, prior to this development.
before the grand jury, before the grand jury made this finding, were
you the law enforcement oficials or in the police department?

Mr. Brown. No, sir.

‘The Cuainstax. Were you suspicious that such an organization
existed in your cit

Mr, Brows. Oh, yes; law enforcement has been aware that this has
been there,

‘The Cirsirataw, There was something, you felt confident, but you
were unable to bring it out in conerete proof; is that correct?

Mr. Brown. ‘That is correct.

‘The Cuamscan, So you had been trying to combat it without being
able to get it out in the open?

Mr. Brown. That is exactly right.

‘The Cuaraan. Allright. Proceed.

Mr. Browy (reading) :

our records indicate that the vast majority of owe unsolved crimes stem
from underworld aetivity involving persone of Sicilian or Hallam ancestry * **

‘The Crramacax, We had come startling information here the other
day from the Chieago chief of police with respect to some 976
murders, gangland style, that had been committed over a period of
years, and only 2 of them had been solved. ‘That is, officially solved by
court determination or court action.

Mr. Browx. That istypical.

‘The Craimatax, What is the ratio in your community, if you can
give ussome idea about it?

Mr, Brown. I will bring that out in my statement, but it is just
like Chicago.

‘The Curammmax. Something along that line?

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.

The Ciramwan, That, struck me as one of the most frightening
developments of information that I have heard regarding crime.
just. couldn’t believe that 976 murders, and apparently just_ murder
in the first-degree fashion, conld he committed in an area like Met:
ropolitan Chicago over a period of years, and only 2 of them could
be solved. It thoroughly demonstrates to me the great menace and
the danger of organized mobs committing crime.

You gay: “Well, they probably killed each other pretty much.”
That may be true, but they kill each other because of the extortionate

at large, and to the detriment of innocent people who can’t help
themselves, Tt focuses and emphasizes how serious this menace is,

Very well, you may proceod,

Mr, Brows. Notwithstanding these findings, the grand jury con
chided that there was no national or local Mafia in Tampa.” I would
Tike to submit ag exhibit 1 a certified copy of the report of the grand
jury dated Mareh 30. 1956.

‘The Crainstax. Very well, this report of the grand jury will be

Semitor Musite. May I ask a question, Chief, there?

‘As T understand what you have just testified relative fo the grand
jury's report, they acknowledged that there was some evidence of the
axistence of Sicilian Mafia in the community, but apparently felt
that evidence was not conclusive; is that a correct summary?

‘Mr. Brows. That is corrects yes, Senator. ‘The Tampa Police De-
partment, however, has long been aware that many criminals in our
Thea have local reputations as Matiosi. My staff and I have made a
careful tion of those reputations, based upon personal knowl.
edge, criminal records, stirveillance reports, personal histories, familial
Telationships, statistical analyses, reports from confidential inform-
ants, information from Federal and local law-enforcement agencies,
and ‘other customary police intelligence sonrees.

Tt is our considered conelusion that the Mafia exists in Tampa, that
it controls most iegal gambling in Tampa and central Florida, and
that its members have interstate and international ties to other Mafi
groups.

{r. Browy. That is correct, sir.

Senator Muskie, That is 7 years ago. Do you think you have
acenmulated additional evidence as to the existence of the Mafia in
Tampa which would justify a new reference to the grand jury?

Mr. Browy. Yes; I believe so.

‘There have been at Teast two known aitempts on the life of Santo

American mobsters who Intended to kill Trafiicante’ were told by

Traficante has been arrested in 'Tampa several times for investiga
tion, because of our knowledge that he was deeply involved in gam
bling, even though we have not yet been able to obtain the quantum of
proof necessary to a siiccessful prosecution. He has also been picked
up by the police for questioning about the gangland slayings of Rene
Nunez, Angelo Giglio, and Joo Antinori.

Traficante was a suspect in the Albert Anastasia murder on Oc.

just before the murder. He was considered a likely suspect because

in on Trailicante’s gambling operations in Culm. ‘Traffieante, using
the alias “B, ITill,” stayed with Anastasia in the latter's hotel suit
on the night of October 24, 1957, and moved out approximately 1 how
after Anastasin’s murder int a nearby barber shop.

The Department's evaluation of Trafficante as the hoss of the Mafia
organization in Tampa was confirmed, of course, by the positive identi-
fication of the “Louis Santos of Havana, Cuba,” apprehended at the
Apalachin conference in November of 1957, as Santo Trallicante, Jr.,
of Tampa, Fla.

Furthermore, we have witnessed and docnmented many visits of
out-of-town racketeers with Santo Trafficante and his fellow hoodinms
of the Tampa area, ‘These visitors give further indications that Traf-
fieante is associated with Malin members in other cities. For example,
Louis Coticchia of Chicago, also known as Lou Brady, has been fre-
quently seen visiting Traflicante and on one oceasion they were seen
boarding.a plane together, heading for Miami.

Other known outside tacketecrs who have visited in Tampa with
Traflicante gang members are John Joseph Vitale, Salvatore Lopic
colo, and Anthony Giardano, all known racketeers from St. Louis, Mo,

Mr. Brown. Our department has always found it a most difficult
task to obtain evidence sulficient for successful prosecution of Malia
members, because the witnesses who might offer sich evidence have al-
ways been reluctant to do so. ‘The paramount, reason, of course, is
thelr fear of Mafia reprisals, sinee it is common knowledge in ‘Tampa
that the Mafia does not hesitate to uso murder for sitch reprisals ahd
the relative infrequeney with which such professional murders are
successfully prosecuted.

Mr. Brow. Yes, six,

Mr. Brows. ‘That is correct,

Senator Muskie, What are the characteristics of the gangland sl
ings that makes it so diffienlt. to solve them as contrasted with your
excellent record in ther homicides?

Mr. Brown. Of course, primarily it is because of witnesses who are
reluctant to give the law enforcement any information whatsoever.

‘The Cuamatan. You may proceed.

Mr. Brows, With few exceptions, those murders well reflect Joseph

Vilachi’s testimony that Mafia members do live by violence and die
by violence.

‘At least twvo of the unsolved murders on our list—that of Gus Perez
in 1936 and of Joe “Pelusa” Dinz. in 1958—were, in my opinion, di-
rectly attributable to the Mafia’s knowledge or belief that the victims
had given to legal authorities evidence incriminating Mafia members.
A third murder—of Carl Carramusa, in 1945—taking place in Chi-
cago, involved some ‘Tampa Maliosi, and is of partiewlar interest in
illustrating the Mafia zeal for vengeance against a member who vio-
lates its rules. It is of further significance, too, in demonstrating the
dificulty of protecting witnesses against the Mafla—and is under-
lining Attorney General Kennedy's request for additional funds for
that purpose, which request I strongly endorse.

‘The Carramusa case developed in Kansas City, Mo, with certain
aspects related to the Mafia organization in Tampa. ‘The principal
figuro in the case was Carl Carramusa, known as a minor member of
the Mafia and a front man for the Mafia’s narcotics traffic operation
in Kansas City.

Carramusa was indicted in 1942 for conspiring to violate the Fed-
eral narcotic laws. His codefendanis were Joseph DeLuca, Nicola
Impastato, Paul Antinori, Joe Antinori, Charles Gerrgimina, Louis
Ventola, Batsy Ventola, Charles Tiabi, Samuel Pernice, and Fellipo
Fernice. Tampa’s Mafia organization was one of the sources of sup-
ply, for the Kansas City group, and at thine time the nareoties trade
In Tampa was headed by Paul Antinori and Joseph Antinori, who
had inherited the narcotics leadership from their father, Ignazio An-
tinori, ‘The elder Antinori had been murdered a few years before in
anareotics deal. All of the defendants in the Kansas City case were
prosecuted successfully, primarily because Carramusa violated the
cardinal Mafia code of Vomerta, or silence, testifying openly against
them at their trial. After the trial, Carrdinusa Went into hiding in
Chicago with his wife and family, changing his name and beginning
anew life under new circumstances.

‘Three years later, in June of 1945, while he was seated in his auto-
mobile, Carramusa’S head was blown off by a shotgun blast. James
Lumin, an associate of the Antinoris, was a suspect in this killing,
but was himself murdered at ‘Tampa in June of 1950. A. prime suspect
was the same Nicola Impastato, who had some years before attempted
tokill Charles Wall.

In Tampa we have suffered also the frustration I know that many
of my police colleagues in other cities have experienced—the deliberate
recanting at trial of the original statements of complaining or key
witnesses, because of their fear of Mafia reprisal. A clear instance
of this frustration of law enforcement effort involved three of the
ranking members of theTampa Mafia,



588 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIY TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS

One day in 1953, one Joe Castetiano went to the Italian Club in
Tampa to play cards with a group of friends, During the course
of the evening, he talked to Salvatore Seaglione privately. Scagliong
asked Castellano if he wanted to make a profit on a “hot load” of
whisky. Castellano said he was interested, and they agreed to meet
later that night.

‘At the meeting, Scaglione was accompanied by Joo Mistretta and
Angelo LoScalzo.’ Castellano got into the front seat of a car provided
by the others, and the four men drove toa thickly wooded area outside

+ of Tampa city limits. Castellano was then attacked with a hammer,
boing hit repeatedly on the head. Te managed to get out of the car,
although he was badly hurt. He broke loose from his elderly assail*
ants and ran away. Ife stumbled into a nearby house and asked to
be taken to the constuble’s house, where he gave a statement about
the incident, naming the three as his assailants. He swore to the
county solicitor that he had no idea why he was beaten. —Seaglione,

tretta, and LoScalzo were arrested and charged with assault with

jntent to murder.

Joe Custellano disappeared for a period of time. After he was
found, the case went to trial, Castellano changed his story completely
and testified that he had injured himself while hunting on the night
of the attack, ‘The predictable result, of course, was a verdict for the
defendants of “not guilty.”

ATIONS FOR FURTHER FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO FIGHT

ORGANIZED CRIME

RECOMME:

I believe firmly that. it is almost impossible for the Police Depart-
ment of the City of Tampa, or any other municipality, to cope ef-
fectively with the activities of a national or international crime
syndicate such as these hearings show exists in the United States.
One of the main problems is that the most dedicated, well-trained,
nd well-staifed police force is almost always limited legally and
i financially. to the territorial boundaries of its municipality.
example, the Tampa Police’ Department is obviously interested in
and informed about the activities of Santo Trafficante. However, in
the past the department was imable to do anything about T'rafficante’s
operations in. pre-Castro Cuba; it has no jurisdiction or control of
his illegal affairs in Miami and elsewhere in central Florida. ‘The
department could only record that he attended the Apalachin meeting
in November of 1957, but it could do nothing about this obvious evi-
dence that ho was ‘a high-ranking member of a national crime
syndicate.

Tn the light of our experience with the Mafia in our own city’s
underworld, E submit for this subcommittee’s consideration some sug-
gestions for Federal legislation which I believe would certainly help
Focal Jaw enforcement agencies to fight organized crime more
effectively.

1, More ample funds must be obtained by local agencies to recruit
high caliber police personnel and to retain superior personnel having
the experience and capabilities to understand, investigate, and prose-
cute organized criminal conspiracies. Because of the demonstrated
interstate nature of organized crime, Federal legislation similar to

Could Rosselli Have Linked
Castro Plot to JFK Death?

By RON LaBRECQUE
Herald Statt Writer

In 1960, when the CIA was try-
ing to set up a delicate attempt on
. the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to
a man once described as “the big-
“gest flag-waving SOB in the coun-

try” — West Coast underworld
‘figure Johnny Rosselli.

Rosselli — a seemingly improba-
‘ble conspirator in a government
plot — got the “flag-waving” label
from Salvatore (Momo) Giancdna,
‘then Chicago's top crime boss and
a man Rosselli brought into that
ysame plot.

Now both are dead, murdered in
the past year, and investigators are
wondering whether their plotting
led to their deaths and whether the
CIA plots against Castro — only
recently made public and even kept
from the Warren Commission —~
are vitai clues to the John F. Ken-
nedy assassination.

The deaths of Giancana, in June
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,
have aroused a renewed concern in
Washington, where on Friday the

House of Representives voted to re«
Open the investigation of the Ken-
nedy murder.

REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,
Va.) who will be chairman of the
Panel, said he is “convinced” a con-'
spiracy was involved in Kennedy's
death.

Now, in the aftermath of the=vi
olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-'
selli, the question arises of: what
role, if -any, the Kennedy White
House played in the early 1960s
“deal” the CIA made with the two
underworld figures to have Castro
murdered. | :

Whether “the Kennedy 7 White’
House knew ‘about about the CIA's
Plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found
out after the contacts were ended),
the ‘CIA's use of the underworld

Page 679

‘seems ironic in retrospect.
# Robert Kennedy’s passionate ef-
forts to disable organized crime are

well documented.

IN 1960 when ‘Robert Kennedy
wrote about what he had learned
of organized crime in America
from his years as chief counsel to
the Senate Rackets Committee, he
too quoted Giancana to make a
point.

He told about Giancana’s inter-
‘view at his local draft board at the
outbreak of World War Il, when
he was asked what he did for a liv=
ing.

Er steal,” Giancana is said to
have replied.

So Sam Giancana didn't go to
)war and years later would boast to
Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that
he stayed out of the Army — la-
‘beled unfit — by telling the truth.

i “What's wrong with the syndi-
‘cate?” Kennedy. quoted Giancana.
“Two or three of us get together
fon a business deal and everybody
‘says it's a bad thing. Businessmen
\do it all the time- and nobody
‘squawks.”

A Senate committee began stu-.
dying the Kennedy questions more:
ithan a year ago as it Jooked at co-
vert CIA activities.

IN AN addendum to the Senate
{Intelligence Committee's interim
treport last November, Sen. Howard
:Baker (R., Tenn.) said, “It is my
tpersonal view that on balance the
‘likelihood that presidents (the re-
‘port deait with Dwight Eisenhower
and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro)
assassination plots is greater than.
the likelihood that they did not.”
dust to trace Rosselli's history
iwith the CIA is mind-boggling for
the investightors. Yet, it is just one
‘aspect of the search for his killer.
= Johnny Rosselli —- born on the
fourth of July in Esperia, Italy, and
71 when he died — was not first
and foremost a CIA operative. _

® His greater role as evidenced by
fwo convictions, his associations
‘and to some extent his own com-
ments, was as an influential, if
publicly lesser known, organized
crime figure.

£
# HIS ASSOCIATION with other
identified underworld members
was monitored by law enforcement
agencies as recently as several
cweeks ‘before “his July 28 disap-
pearance.
* By all accounts, Rosselli was a.
,charming man, dressing in expen-
sive clothes, married for. only two
fyears “in the early 1940s and
tknown most of his life as one who
jeasily attracted women.
1, te was an immigrant who told
in a short autobiography written
fabout 1967 that his “life of crime” ©
«began as a teenager in Boston, at-
tempting arson for his stepfather
nd: stealing $50 on his own. As he-:
jtraveled west, finally to settle in.
(California, his ‘attention turned to
(bootlegging, gambling and dab-
‘bling in the movie business.

| IT IS said that Rosselli guarded
the West Coast gambling interests
for Giancana's Chicago syndicate.
i Why Rosselli was chosen by the
(CIA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un-
clear, although CIA officials have
since testified that they wanted the
‘kind of contacts in Cuba which or-
‘ganized crime had made during the
Pre-Castro days when Havana was
‘a.gamblers’ haven. :
‘ ‘Giancana was enlisted by Rossel-
li because he had influence with -
Florida's Santo Trafficante, consid-
ered the key underworld gambling
figure in Havana

The unraveling of CIA and un- °
derworld conspiracies. an awesome
iweb spanning decades, is left to a
team of nine in the Metro Homicide
Division. It is a team now clearly
consumed hy the task which has
been a’ full-time operation since
Rosselli’s body was pulled from
Dumfoundling ‘Bay on. Aug. 7.



! THAT THE Metro team is even
Involved is happenstance. Rosselli .
lived in Plantation, Broward Coun-
ty, with his sister and brother-i
Jaw. It's just that his killers chose
to dump his body in Dade.

While. several _detéctives say
their instincts lead them to con-
clude that the Rosselli murder was
ah internal underworld affair, all
‘on the team are aware of the pres-
sure on them to search each clue
that leads back to the CIA-Castro
affair. :

With: Rosselli's death this sum-
mer, the newly appointed Senate
committee saw its list of knowl-
edgeable witnesses further trim-
med.-Some of those witnesses have
died violently and some from natu-
ral causes.

' When Giancana was murdered in
June of 1975, before he could even
be questioned by the committee
staff, authorities attributed it to an
internal gangland struggle — even
though. the: murderer is still un-
known.

~The death of Rosselli, who had
appeared before the committee
three times in the past year with-
out immunity, caused greater con:

- cern on Capitol Hill.

‘THE SAME night Rosselli's body
was identified — the legs hacked
off and stuffed along with the body
into an oil drum — Baker, vice
chairman of the Senate Intelligence!
Committee, called for the FBI to}
get involved in the case. (Several|
days later, Attorney General Ed.
ward Levi ordered FBI involv
ment.)

It wasn’t until several weeks
later, however, that what was
known to Baker. became public
knowledge.

A section of the former commit-
tee’s April report told of a Wash-
ington attorney who in 1967. went.
to Supreme Court Chief Justic
Earl Warren (chairman: of the
then-disbanded Warren: Commi:
sion) to.say that two'of his" clients
believed they knew ‘about Cub:

“There was never the slightest.
doubt in John’s mind that Castro.

was responsible for the assassina--

tion of Kennedy,” said Edward P.
Morgan, the attorney referred to in
the report.
Morgan is an attorney of no
mean stature in Washington. He
~ served as chief counsel to the joint.
congressional ‘ committee » which
studied the Pearl Harbor attack,
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and for seven
po was chief inspector of the
‘BI.

ROSSELLI told Morgan about
the CIA plot in 1967, when the De-
partment of Justice was vigorously
attempting to deport Rosselli. for
being an illegal alien.

Rosselli, Morgan said, “was cer-

tain that the people he (Rosselli) .
put around ‘Castro in the CIA plot -

turned right around and killed Ken-
nedy, The people he still knew (in
1967) did it.”

Rosselli, according to Morgan,
decided to talk about his CIA activ:

ity in hopes of decreasing the pres- ;

sure from the FBI and Department
of Naturalization and Immigration,.
both Justice Department agencies.

Several. friends of Rosselli, in-!
cluding Morgan, say they are con--

vinced the FBI tried to get Rosselli
to become’ an organized crime. in-
formant by threatening to have
him deported if-he ‘didn’t coopera-
te.

IN’ 1961, _ through _ a bungled
Wiretap “effort, “the “FBI * became:
* aware of Rosseili’s CIA activities. '*

While Giancana’ and Rosselli«
were in Florida planning the opera-
tion, Giancana wanted to return to
Las Vegas to check on: his girl
friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he
suspected’ of dating comedian Dan
Rowan. To keep Giancana in Flori-
da, it was agreed that a bug would
be placed in her hotel room and her
conversations monitored.

But the private detective they
hired, with CIA money. it has since |
been learned, was discovered and
arrested. Eventually the police in-
vestigation led back to the Castro |

- plotters.
- Prosecution was avoided when
the CIA intervened and said the’
“national interest” would be -dam-
. aged if the plot en be-
” came public.

WHEN THE wiretap case was
again -to be investigated in 1966,
this time by a Senate committee
headed by the late Sen. Edward
Long (D., Mo.), the CLA again step-
ped in to stop it.

Morgan was told about the pend-
ing investigation by Rosselli and
Robert Mahue, a former FBI
agent-turned Howard Hughes aide
who was the CIA's. initial link to.
Rosselli.

Mahue told Morgan that’ both he:
and Rosselli had been subpenaed to:
appear before the committee. Mor-#
gan said he called Lawrence Hou:
ton, the CIA general counsel. Hous¢:
ton went to Long and the investi
gation was dropped.

eZ MORGAN SAID he knew, as the
Senate committee recently empha-‘
sized as well, that all information:
about the CIA plots — which couk
have been the incentive for pro-*
Castro. forces to kill Kennedy —:
had been kept from the Warren:
Commission.

“I was an admirer of Earl War-
ren,” Morgan said. “(His) report*
said that ... Oswald alone killed?
Kennedy. It kept bugging me after.
so gruesome a detail from Rosselli»
that the Chief Justice could put his
name on a report, which didn’t as-
sess the ‘most’ significant. piece of.
evidence bearing on the killing of
Kennedy.” -

The information. Morgan had
‘was passed to Warren via.colum-
nist Drew Pearson, a mutual
friend. Eventually, it reached the-
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di-
rect orders’ from President Lyndon
Johnson in the spring of 1967, in-
vestigation was not vigorously Pure?
sued.

THE SENATE Intelligence Com-.
mittee compared that apparent. in-’
action with a statement former FBI
director J. Edgar Hoover made ‘to
the Warren Commission on-May 5,;
1964. Hoover said, “well, I can as:
sure. you so far as the FBI is con-.
cerned. the case will be continued;

: ing to us or any report coming to:

us from any source will be thor-:

oughly investigated, so that we
Swill’ be “able "to" prove: or 'disprovel
#the allegation.”

A Senate Committee staff a
ber commented recently, “what is
really happening is that the investi-
gation which the FBI should have
done in 1967 — and no one can

‘come close to explaining why it
wasn't — is actually being done
now.”

HART, AS have local investiga-
tors, has established three possible
scenario’s for Rosselli’s death: his
recent organized crime activity, re-
taliation for his Castro assassina-
tion efforts or the information he
held concerning the JFK assassina-
tion.

article by Alton Frye, a senior fel-
low of the Council Foreign Rela~

_ Frye wrote that he visited Ha~
vana recently and met with Cuban,
officials including, Deputy Prime.
Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.
“"... they volunteer the suspicion
that the recent murders of Sam Gi-

surely have some connection with

THERE HAVE been theories re-

probably in the very hour JFK was
shot, a one-time Castro supporter
was receiving a poison pen device
from a CIA agent in what was a
long-running anti-Castro ‘effort.

Smathers has since said Kennedy
rejected the idea and that the dis-

AT LEAST one high-level CIA
official did testify he believed the
White House was being briefed on
the plots but according to Richard
Bissell, one of the officials who
originally decided to use Rosselli, it
was through the method of “plau-
‘sible deniability.”

That, according to the recent
Senate report, “can also lead to the
use of euphemism and circumlocu-"
tion, which are designed to allow
the President and other senior offi-
cials to deny knowledge of an op-
eration should it be disclosed.”

Another alleged link between‘
the White House and the under-
world plotters, first made public by
the Senate Committee, has also
been denied by virtually everyone
involved. Judith: Campbell Exner,
the woman who claims to have

_been friend and lover to both Gian-

cana and JFK, introduced to both
by Frank Sinatra, was not a link in.
the Castro plotting, those close’ to
both Giancana and Kennedy have.

said. , :

A MAN with access to Kenne-
dy's closest advisers told The Her-
ald recently, ‘The. Giancana-Ros-
selli thing is unrelated to the Exner|
thing..I was theré, JFK knew,
her, but he was ni about. thos
kinds of things:

There is documentation to show
that on March 22, 1962, Hoover

_lunched: privately ‘with Kennedy

and presumably gave him his first
information linking Exner with the
gangsters. The final
phone call between the White,
House and Exner was made only
few hours later. . *

Another possible link discussed,
in the Senate report shows that the|
same unidentified Cuban-to whoi
Rosselli passed the poison pilis|
prior to the Bay of Pigs operatio:
in April of 1961, was among
group of Cuban: exile leaders whi
met with JFK following the inva:

_IT IS known that several of the ~
Cubans with _ whom _ Rosselli
worked have been identified, but

recorded.

‘

>
As a condition- to his appear--1
ances before the Senate Committee,
in the past year, it was agreed that?
Rosselli “would not state the !
names or confirm. the existence of,
those agents’ whom he knew.!
about,” Rosselli's attorney Leslie:}
= Scheer said. : ea
‘The friends and acquaintances of
. Rosselli who could be contacted by
The Herald all ‘said they never
;\heard the names of the ‘Cuban;
agents, ee
But “a “committee’ “source” ‘cau- !
:tioned, “they (Cuban agents) read-*
the committee's report, they know:
‘who's being referred to.”

ANOTHER - Rosselli. attorney, -
‘Tom Wadden, a partner of Edward«
Bennett Williams; said, “Yes, It

’ think he. had more knowledge’
than he testified to. ce

Searching Rosselli's more recent.
past. for. enemies also presents’

, Problems, investigators say." *
“The decline of John Rosselli ap-#
, ‘pears to begin in the late 1960s. In<
1967, he was convicted in a card:
cheating scandal at the posh, celeb-"
| rity-filled Friar’s Club in: Los. An-
geles where the influence of Sina-
tra had made him a member ac--
cording to investigators.

Deportation pressures. were also

mounting at this time. 7

ROSSELLI entered prison on the
conviction in 1970 where he would;
serve three years of a five-year,
sentence. ~

In 1971; he was brought td a,
federal grand jury in Los Angeles .
which was probing whether some ;
indentified Detroit organized crime

leaders conspired with the Emprise’
Corp. — a giant firm with nations
wide race track and sporting event!
concessions — ‘to: hide ‘financial in-;
terests in the, Frontier Hotel in’ Las.
Vegas. : i

Rosselli, too, had, an’ interest in
the Frontier, which opened in 1967.
He owned the gift shop concession
‘along, with a partner named Joe-
Breen. How Rosselli obtained the
concession is unclear, but” Breen

« Said it gave Rosselli an‘ income of

about $60,000.

ROSSELLI at one time hdd been
a major influence in Las Vegas.
Several sources sajd that when: the
owners of the Desert Inn wanted
Howard Hughes to move out of the
penthouse — because his special
needs were ‘costly and -putting


some: “high. rollers” in would be
more profitable — it was Rosselli
‘who patched things up.

Hughes eventually bought the
Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier.

What Rosselli told the federal
grand “jury about the Frontier in
1971 is unknown. Rosselli didn’t
testify later at the trial at which
Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael Pol-
izzi and the. Emprise Corp.,.amon|
others, were convicted.

ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in
jail. In 1973, the House of Repre-
sentatives Select’ Committee on
Crime probed the influence of or-
ganized crime in sports — and one
area they looked at was Emprise.
and the Frontier Hotel case.

At the time of the conviction, the
federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-
zi and Terilli be jailed immediately,
because monitored, _ wiretapped'
conversations showed that the two
had talked about “murder, the kill-
ing of certain individuals.”

- An intimate associate of Rosselli,
however, discounts the possibility
that Rosselli's grand jury appear-
ance could have led, to his death.
“They know Johnny didn’t talk to
the grand jury,” the associate said.

JOE BREEN said Rosselli hadn’
been to Las Vegas for nine years,
that “he’s never even seen the gift
shop.”

Since his prison ‘release and
move to Plantation, Rosselli wasn’t
trying to regain power; according)
to his friends. “He had no muscle.”
said an. associate."I can't believe’
Rosselli was getting back into’ mob
stuff.”

But at the same time, many of
the associates were surpised to
learn about Rosselli's recent visits
with alleged organized crime fig-
ures on the West Coast.

Several associates speculate that
Rosselli wanted to get involved in

casino gambling, preferably in the
Middle. East,. and was looking’ for
someone with. maneyato, back him.

“omy IMPRES§| 10) was. that he
‘was: broke,” Morgan. said. “He told
me last.year, ‘I'm_in.bad,financial,
straits.’ Boa

Scheer said Rosselii’s income in-
cluded about $60,000 from the gift
shop and about $3,500 in social se-
curity, most of which went for
back fees to attorneys and for gov-
ernment fines.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630, Paye 682

One friend said, that ‘just before
Giancana's death, Rosselli had ac-
cepted Giancana’s. offer of money.
The friend was to act as:the inter-
mediary. “Let me figure out what.
my next (attorney's) tab will: be,”
the friend. quoted Rosselli as say-.
ing.

Rosselli is. described. as a man
with a sense of humor who did lit-’
tle offending. =

A California woman- who had
known Rosselli for about 40 years

.told ‘The Herald, “If you were

around him for 30 minutes you'd
like him because he would regard
you as a human being.”

“If you had a headache he would
either get you an aspirin or send
someone to get one. I said’ some-

. thing significant there — he would

get it or he would send someone —
he wasn't a pansy, but he wasn’t a
tough guy either.” '
