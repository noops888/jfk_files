specifying

that one Marie LORENZ was involved with Frank STURGIS and Alex

RORKE in 1959/1960 in anti-CASTRO activities. Furthermore, the

articles again allege that STURGIS and RORKE were acting on

behalf of this Agency.

The 13 June 1976 article further alleges

Marie LORENZ has "claimed that at the direction of STURGIS and

RORKE (and the Agency and the FBI) in 1960 she went to Cuba to

poison CASTRO.

The poison was given to her by STURGIS. In the

first

article

Marie LORENZ alleges that E. Howard HUNT, known
