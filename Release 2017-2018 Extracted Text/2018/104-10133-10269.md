MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

SUBJECT : STURGIS, Frank Anthony
AKA: FIORINI, Frank
SF#353 459

1. As you are aware, Frank Anthony STURGIS, one of the
convicted Watergate burglars, has repeatedly and falsely claimed
affiliation with this Agency. Attached to instant memorandum
are copies of two articles from the New York Daily News by Paul
MESKIC, dated circa April 1975 and 13 June 1976, specifying
that one Marie LORENZ was involved with Frank STURGIS and Alex
RORKE in 1959/1960 in anti-CASTRO activities. Furthermore, the
articles again allege that STURGIS and RORKE were acting on
behalf of this Agency. The 13 June 1976 article further alleges
Marie LORENZ has “claimed that at the direction of STURGIS and
RORKE (and the Agency and the FBI) in 1960 she went to Cuba to
poison CASTRO. The poison was given to her by STURGIS. In the
first article Marie LORENZ alleges that E. Howard HUNT, known
to her as "Eduardo" was the paymaster for STURGIS and RORKE.
HUNT has publicly claimed not knowing STURGIS until at least
the late 1960's.

2. Alex RORKE,#s identical with Alexander I. RORKE, Jr.
(SF#427 955), was a free-lance writer, photographer, and soldier
of fortune who. disappeared in September 1963 while flying in
Central America. There is no evidence in this file that RORKE
was ever affiliated with this Agency. There is evidence that
RORKE was involved with STURGIS in anti-CASTRO activities in
the early 1960's.

3. Relative to Marie LORENZ, initial Office of Security
traces in this name were negative in April 1975. Additional
research relative to the June 1976 article has. revealed a
positive identification. Composite information from the attach-
ments would suggest that Marie LORENZ is of German father/
American mother birth, born circa 1940; that her father was
Heinrich LORENZ, a former German Navy Captain who_in February
1959 was the captain of a luxury liner "Berlin"; [apd that in
1959/1960 she was living with her brother at 344 West sath

8. Relative to LORENZ's claim in the attached article
that she and Alex RORKE (in conjunction with the assassination
attempt against CASTRO) visited FBI offices in New York and
had a "conference with the two agents who had questioned her
previously and a CIA official", it is interesting to note that
LORENZ was interviewed by SA-O'Brien on 22 December 1959. The
file of Alexander I, RORKE, Jr., reflects that he was inter-
viewed on 30 December 1959 by SA Francis J. O'Brien, FBI, New
York.
