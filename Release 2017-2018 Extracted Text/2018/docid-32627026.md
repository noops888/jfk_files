ANNEX A

INTERROGATION GUIDE: CUBA

This annex consists of the Interrogation Guide: Cuba which

was primarily designed for debriefing Cuban escapees/ refugees and

for advance briefing

and debriefing of visitors (including agents) to

Cuba. It also provided a systematic statement of information needs

to be used as the basis for collection planning,

collection action, and

responsive reporting. This guide was originally prepared by CIA in

February 1962 for use by the Caribbean Admissions. Center, Opa-Locka.

It was revised in March with full community participation. A major

revision of the guide took place in May with full USIB coordination..

5000 FACTORY MARKINGS

Valuable intelligence information on the Soviet Bloc can

be obtained from the study of factory markings appearing on equipment

produced in the BLOC.

Of particular interest are serial numbers

and other markings on Soviet Bloc aircraft, artillery, motor

vehicles (including trucks, prime movers, etc., and scientific

equipment of all types:) Also all material of Naval interest such

as, communications equipment, sonar, ordnance, ASW (including mines,

torpedoes, depth charges, ahead thrown weapons, etc.), propulsion

machinery, Hover and Hydrofoil craft, pharmaceutical and medical

supplies and equipment, etc.

5001 (Exploitation opportunities) Minimum markings exploitation

of each piece of equipment and itsscomponents would include:

a. Type designation

b. Serial number

c. Date of production

d. Manufacturer

These data usually are available on nameplate or stamped into the

metal parts of equipment.

Documents, especially technical passports

or logbooks, are a valuable source because of the exact production

dates therein.

If the data include unfamiliar characters such as

Cyrillic or Chinese, an approximation of the type designation, (that

is familiar letters

and numbers) often is enough to establish the

product type and manufacturer where information is available from

other sources. Obviously, considerable attention to accuracy of

serial number and date information is necessary. Collection by

photography is preferred, if practicable; physical impressions

by clay, tape or overlay pencil rubbings next; and lacking this,

accurately hand-copied data can be used.

5002 (Interrogation opportunities) Does source recall any

numbers and/or letter number combinations stenciled or stamped on

Bloc equipment in Cuba? Any supporting photographs or similar

materials should be forwarded with reporting.

Review of NIE's and SNIE's on Cuba

Through 14 October 1962

1. SNIE 80-62, "The Threat to US Security Interests in the

Caribbean Area, " Dated 17 January 1962.

This estimate was done before there was

any evidence of a build-up

of sophisticated weapons in Cuba, but the possibility was explored that the

Soviets might consider establishing "missile,

submarine, or air bases

designed to bring North America under attack or to add to the deterrents

to any conceivable U.S. military action in the Caribbean or elsewhere."

The estimators concluded, on the basis of their understanding of past

Soviet policy and of the risks the Soviets would perceive, that a Soviet

move to establish

such bases was unlikely for some time to come. They

pointed out that the Soviets in the past had been careful to retain control

over situations which involved them in

any serious degree of risk. Finally,

they pointed out that such a move would be inconsistent with their purposes

in Latin America. Nevertheless, they noted that the USSR could and pro-

bably would augment its naval, air, and communications capabilities in

the area by arrangements not openly identifiable as Soviet bases.

2. NIE 85-62, "'The Situation and Prospects in Cuba," dated 21 March 1962.

This estimate was designed to present a detailed picture of develop-

ments within Cuba and of Soviet activities there. The authors noted the

steady communization of Cuba and the complexity of Soviet and Cuban

SECRET

DocId: 32627026 Page 221

## Page 222

SECRET

Communist relations with Castro. They found no evidence of a Soviet

intention to develop Cuba into a strategic base nor of any change in the

Soviet policy of spreading communism in Latin America by encouraging

and supporting Communist and non-Communist revolutionaries.

They

took account of the military equipment already in Cuba. An examination

of this armament, however, led them to point out "that Bloc military

deliveries to Cuba to date have been such as to enhance Cuba's capabilities

for defense against external attack and for the maintenance of internal

security rather than to contribute to the development of an independent

offensive military capability.". They added, "The Bloc has provided no

strategic weapon systems."

The estimators then made the judgment that the. Bloc would be

unlikely to provide Cuba with air, missile, or naval capabilities suitable

for independent operations overseas, or to station Bloc combat units in

Cuba.

They did not believe, however, that this would preclude liberal

provision of Bloc military advisers and technicians, or the provision of

such defensive weapons and equipment as surface-to-air missiles and

radars, or a token number of IL-28 jet light bombers.

Thus the intelligence community took into account the possibility

of the build-up of SAM's and IL-28's and. of Soviet military personnel which

did in fact take place in August and September. What the estimators thought

unlikely, along with an independent Cuban offensive capability, was the

..?::..

SECRET

DocId: 32627026 Page 222

---

## Page 223

SECRET

deployment to Cuba of Soviet combat units and of strategic weapons under

Soviet control.. They thought this because they believed that the Soviets

were aware of the geographic advantages which the U. S. would enjoy in

any military confrontation in the neighborhood of Cuba and that they

would estimate that there would be a high risk of U. S. intervention to

prevent the establishment of an offensive base there. They estimated that

the Soviets would not wish to bring on a confrontation with the U. S. under

unfavorable circumstances and with attendant risks of general war. They

were

also impressed by the political and psychological importance of the

Soviet position in Cuba and by the prospect that it could be used to effect

the spread of communism in Latin America. They could see no reason for

the USSR to risk that position by inviting U. S. intervention.

3. NIE 85-2-62, "The Situation and Prospects in Cuba, " dated 1 August 1962.

The analysis of Soviet relations with Castro noted the concessions,

both political and economic, which the Soviets had made to Castro in order

to maintain their position in Cuba. The estimators saw no indication,

however; of a change in the over-all Soviet posture toward the U. S. and

Latin America..

After a careful examination of previous Bloc military shipments.to

Cuba, they concluded that the effect of the shipments was still "to enhance

Cuba's capabilities: for defense against external attack"' and maintain Cuba's

internal security, but that they did not provide an offensive capability. They

- 3 -

SECRET

DocId: 32627026 Page 223

## Page 224

SECRET

went on to estimate that the Bloc would limit its military assistance to

Cuba in this way, although they said again that such a policy would

not

preclude provision of more advanced jet fighters, surface-to-air missiles,

IL-28 bombers, and the liberal

provision of Bloc technicians.

Once again the estimators took into account the possibility of the

build-up that was to take place in August and September, and once again

they deemed

it unlikely that the USSR would develop a strategic base.

Their reasons were as before. The evidence on Soviet policy toward the

U. S. and Latin America in general remained as it had been. They believed

the Soviets were fully aware of the risks inherent in the deployment of

strategic weapons.

Furthermore the military build-up in Cuba continued

to be marked by the absence of air and sea lift which would have given Castro

a capability for attacking his neighbors and by the absence of strategic

weapon systems.

NIE 85-2-62 was completed and passed by USIB before intelligence

had become available on the military build-up that began in the last days of

July. During the month of August, evidence on the progress of the build-up

accumulated. By the end of the month it had become possible to piece. to-

gether from a mass of ground reports a picture which included the deploy-

ment of SAM's and the arrival of large numbers of Bloc personnel under

military discipline.

It was not until 29 August and 5 September, however,

that aerial surveillance provided a clear picture of this: build-up. SNIE: 85-3-62

was then written.

## Page 225

SECRET

4. SNIE 85-3-62, "The Military Build-up in Cuba, " dated 19 September 1962.

The key question to be answered was whether the new build-up

reflected basic changes in Soviet policy. The estimators concluded that it

did not, although it marked a dramatic change of pace. They believed that

the military establishments in Cuba remained essentially defensive in

character and that the Soviets had continued to avoid making an open pledge

to protect Cuba under all circumstances. They saw no evidence to contra-

dict the long established pattern of Soviet concern for the political and

psychological advantages that they gained from their position in Cuba. The

estimators placed their greatest. emphasis.on the.continued belief that the

Soviets recognized that the development of an offensive military base in

Cuba might provoke U. S. military intervention and thus defeat their purpose.

At the same time the estimators observed that the Soviets were

probably still uncertain about their future military program in Cuba and that

they probably intended to test the U. S. and Latin American reaction as they

proceeded with it. They went on to point out that their analysis of Soviet

policy in Cuba was based on an over-all evaluation of Soviet interests and

intentions, as well as on Soviet actions in and with respect to Cuba. While

they had concluded on this basis that Soviet policy remained fundamentally

unaltered, they did not wish to exclude the possibility that Moscow was at

least considering a change in this policy.

Therefore, in SNIE 85-3-62, they

examined not only the Soviet military build-up in Cuba and developments in

that build-up which might follow, but also "the nature and implications of

= 5 -

SECRET

DocId: 32627026 Page 225

---

## Page 226

SECRET

military assistance which the Soviets. could provide Cuba in the event of

a major change of policy. "

In analyzing the implications of the "current build-up" they pointed

out that some of the new weapons could be used for offensive as well as

defensive purposes, but that the pattern of aid to that date appeared

"clearly designed to strengthen the defenses of the island, thereby pro-

tecting the Communist beachhead in the Western Hemisphere and raising

the price the lJ. S. would have to pay to eliminate it by military action."

They noted that the military establishment in Cuba still lacked a significant

strike capability.

They then examined the possibilities for expansions of the build-up.

They noted that the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons

had become a major issue and that the Soviets were aware that a case could

be made for supplying. "defensive" weapons and that the supply of other

types would pose a challenge to which the U. S. might forcefully respond.

They discussed the various weapons which the Soviets might try to inject

into Cuba while still claiming that their purpose was defensive--IL-28

and TU-16 bombers, SS-1 and SS-2 missiles, submarines and destroyers.

In this connection, the estimators suggested "a modest number of IL-28's"

as a next move in testing U. S. reactions. "Thus," they concluded, "the

Soviets may experiment with a number of further steps in the military

build-up." The Soviet decision to do so, however, would be strongly .......

influenced by their estimate as to whether they could be introduced without

SECRET

forceful U. S. intervention.

The estimators next considered the use of Cuba as a Soviet

strategic missile base. They pointed out that Soviet planners might

see some utility in deploying MRBM's and IRBM's to Cuba and in estab-

lishing a submarine base there. Their net judgment, however, was that

the Soviets would not make such deployments, in part because

such

actions would run counter to their policies for the communization of

Latin America,

"but primarily because "they would almost certainly

estimate that this could not be done without provoking a dangerous U. S.

reaction."

INTELLIGENCE JUSTIFICATION FOR U-2 OVERFLIGHTS OF CUBA

intelligence on the progress of the Soviet arms build-up in Cuba. The

very highest levels of the government are dependent upon this intelli-

gence to assist in making policy decisions of immediate and vital

concern to the nation. At the present time, this intelligence can best

be provided, with sufficient timeliness and broadness of scope, by

overflying Cuba with the U-2.

2. The items of most immediate concern are the missile

installations springing up all over the island. SA-2 sites are present

in various stages of construction, including some sites where available

photography shows only the missile hardware present with no actual

construction yet under way (e.g:, Jiguani suspect SAM site). There

are also SSM sites which have been observed on recent coverage of the

eastern end of the island and on the Isle of Pines. Two sites on older

coverage of Cuba have also been re-evaluated as SSM rather than SAM

sites.

The absence of coverage of the western end since August 29,

coupled with the rate of construction we have observed, means that

there may well be many more sites now being built of which we are

unaware.

Ground observers have in several recent instances,

reported sightings of what they believe to be. the SS-4 (SHYSTER) MRBM

in Cuba. These reports must be confirmed or denied by photo coverage.

It is also necessary to know how many KOMAR class PGMG's may be

in service.

3. In addition to the missile threat, on which it is so important

to obtain late date knowledge, we have confirmed the presence of

MIG-21 aircraft in Cuba. Estimates (based on sightings of merchant

shipping with crates which may obtain more disassembled MIG-21's) "

already have been made in figures as high as 36 although we have firm

photo confirmation of only one. We have no way of substantiating

these estimates at the present time other than through overhead

reconnaissance.

4. Given this extensive build-up of arms, the possibility of

U.S. operations in the area cannot be ignored.. To prepare for such

events, the responsible commanders (in the case of overt military

operations) and organizations (in the case of clandestine or unconventional

operations) require up-to-date intelligence on the areas in which they

may be working. These requirements are secondary to the requirements

outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3 above. But they are nonetheless important

and potentially of even greater importance,

5. The requirements stated above have been translated into a list

of objectives by the COMOR Working Group. This list is maintained

up-to-date on the basis of all-source intelligence and a plot of them as

of 1 October is appended as TAB A for information. The schedule of

satellite missions approved for the remainder of the year will probably

provide some intelligence, but it is not timely enough nor of sufficient

resolution to meet our needs. The next mission will not be till mid-

November, some ll weeks after the last good coverage of some areas.

FIRE FLY may also prove highly useful in covering specific objectives

of limited scope. But the small area coverage obtainable by FIRE FLY

makes it less desirable than the U-2. Tactical reconnaissance using

FR-101/F8U-1P aircraft may also prove feasible. But this is supple-

mentary to a U-2 program, not a substitute therefor. Tactical

reconnaissance can provide detailed photography for technical intelli-

gence purposes, but not the repeated, wide area coverage necessary

to cover the present objectives.

6. There is only one presently available way to meet the require-

ments of the government: frequent and regular U-2 overflights of the

island to the extent that primary objectives as shown in TAB A are

covered once a month..

The COMOR recognizes the increased risk to

the aircraft in light of the SA-2 and MIG-21 aircraft present there.

But it must be stated that the current need is extremely urgent, and

the risk involved should be very thoroughly weighed before this coverage

is denied.

This is to let you know that your letter of November 14th

asking for a report on the intelligence community's activities

during the 12-month period preceding 14 October 1962, specifically

in regard to Cuba, has been received and will be discussed at the

meeting of the United States Intelligence Board tomorrow.

Addi-

tionally, I have sent copies of it to Secretary Rusk; Secretary

McNamara, Mr. McGeorge Bundy, and the Attorney General for

their information.

I think you realize that it is a sizeable task to be fully

responsive by the time of your next meeting on December 7th.

Although the Central Intelligence Agency is well along toward its

final report, the consolidation of this report with those from other

members of the intelligence community will require some painstaking

and closely-integrated effort.

I will do my best to get my final report to you prior to

your next meeting.
