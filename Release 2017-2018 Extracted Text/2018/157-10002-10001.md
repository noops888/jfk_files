CIA, (‘Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained for paramilitary skills

as well as intelligence collection, . --However, CIA has noted that, once the agents are
inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort

will be made to attempt such control.) (00207), er Opa-Locka,
