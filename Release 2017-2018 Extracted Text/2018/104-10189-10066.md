“The {rleuds whom Cuwerhttl visited say ho wae sober -
but badly shook, They say he attribited the Kennedy
murdér to a CIA clique which was carrying ons lucrative
racket in gunerunning, narcotico and other contraband,
and manipulating political intrigué to serve its own ends.
Kennedy supposedly got wind that something was going on
and was killed before he could ‘blow.the whistle on tt!
although’the frionda-had always known Underhill to be

” perfectly rational and objective, they at first didn't take

his account seriously. ‘I think the main reason waz,!
explains the husband, ‘that wo couldn't believe that the

CIA could contain. a corrispt-elemont every bit as ruth=

leso*-and more efficient--ao the mafia.’ :

meana convincing. His body wae found by a writing
collaborator, Asher Brynee of the New Republic. Ho
had been shot behind the left car, and an satomatic pistol
was under his left side. Cdd, enys Brynes, bocause
Underhill was right-handed. Brynes thinke the ptotol
waa fitted with a silencer, and occupants of the apartment
building could not recall hearing a shot. Underhill obvi
ously bad been dead several days.

"Garry Underhiil's chilling story is hardly (mplauslble.

contained cliques operating without any real central control..."
