Neutrality Matters; Internal Security = Cuba."

Bureau files indicate Espinosa in 1963 was involved
in a plan to bomb Cuba. Our investigation of this plat,which
was not a Central Intelligence Agency operation, resulted in
seizure of over a ton of dynamite and other material to be
used in making bombs.

Bureau files indicate Cubela has been previously
contacted in Europe by Central Intelligence Agency possibly
with a view towards taking some action against Cuban leaders.
