2. At 1600 on 9 duly I retarned Mr. Rice's call. Se said that they :
hed been told by the State Derarteent that Pedro Inis DIAZ Lang, former _*

chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force, was no longer available. to the 7
People vho wanted to see him. He said thatofficial stant of INS on the
matter is that DIAZ Lans has been aduitted as a resident alien and that
INS cannot be exected to keep track of him since this is a free country.
He also seid that unofficially he wanted to inform me that DIAZ Lans is
under subsoena to the Senate Internal Security Subcomiittee and that ve
could get in touch vith him by contacting the Committee's offices, I
thanked hin for the infermstion and said that I would refer the matter
to my supervisors imediately.

2. Inoticed that the conversational tone used by Kice in telling :
me the-ebove was souewhat forma), and believe that this call vas obviously
for the record. Re-enfcreing my belief is tke fact that Rice said the had
called me outside ef customary Maison channels because be wanted to make
gare that the man who would have to do the work involved vould be adware
of the situation,

——.-- --~ 3e I asked bia then if his meaning was that we could invite hu
Lens to be our volentary guest for the pericd of time necessary for the

4. To take the chill off the conversation, I thanked Nice for the
Cooperation we had received from hin and hig Eureau on the matter of the
exfiltration of the five former FRC offieials fron Cuba. I also asked :
hin if-a letter of apcrecistion oa tis matter nizht be welcome. He
replied that it might be better if I consulted the Alien Branch of the:
Office of Security on this since too many letters of this sort might
cause eyebrows to be raised at INS = and that re were rumors that he
i night be shifted to another position. I said trat I vas sorry to hear’
4 this, but hoped that if true it might be to a less difficult and more
H Fevarding job.
