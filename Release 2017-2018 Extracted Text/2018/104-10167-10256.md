CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

Memorandum of Conversation

DATE: I0 JUlY 1959

SUNJECT

Telephone Conversation with Herbert Nice, Director of Intelligence,

Burean of Immigrations

PARTICIPANTS: Herbert Fice and

COPIES TO :

lo di 1600 on 9 July I returned Mr. Nice's call.

He said that they

hed been told by the State Departeent that Pedro Luis DIAz Lang, former

chef of the Cuban Retolutionery Air Force, was no longer avatlable to the

people who wanted to see hine

He said that official stand of INS on the

matter is that DIAZ Lans has been admitsed

as a resident alien and that

IlS cannot be expected to keep track of him since this is a free countryÂ®

Fe also seid that officially he wanted to infor me that DIAZ Lans is

under subpoena to the Senate Intercal Security Subcomittee and that we

could get in touch sith him by contacting the Comittee's offices. I

thanked hin for the infernation and said that I would refer the matter

to my supervisors 1maediately.

?. I noticed that the conversational tone used by Nice in telling

me the above was somewhat forcal, and believe that this call was obviously

for the record. Re-enfercing my belief is the fact that nice said he had

called me outside of custonary liaison channels because be wanted to make

sure that the man who sould have to do the work involved would be aware

of the situation.

I asked hin then is his meaning was that se could invite bint.

ans to be our voluntary quest for the period of time necessary for the

Intelligence comunity to debrief h's, and he agreed that this was the

casee

I told him tat se had only learned that DIAZ was being brought .

to Washington jesterday afternoon and that there were many intelligence

requirements involred in the matter which we had not had sufficient time

to pouch to our man in Miend.

cooperation we had received from hin and his bureau on the matter of tbe

exfiltration of the five former ERIC officials fron Cuba. I also asked

him. 1f a letter of apreciation on tris matter right, be welcome. He

replied that it might be better 1f I consulted the Alien Branch of the:

Office of Security on this since too many letters of this sort might

cause eyebrows to be raised at I'S - and that there were rumors that be

wight be shifted to another position. I said tat I was sorry to hear:

this, but hoped that if true it might be to a less difficult and more

rewarding job.
