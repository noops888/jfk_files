the KGB representatives, who were allegedly from Vienna,

he claims to have sent only four letters to the accommo-

dations address and he alleges to have furnished

only negative

imminence reports.

In May 1960 Dutkanicz informed

his SIS handler that he was being

investigated for security reasons and he

was advised to apply for

leave and defect with his wife and family to

the USSR via Austria

Czechoslovakia:

Dutkanicz complied

with the instructions.

Contact

with KGB representatives was established on 26 June 1960 In Bratislava,

Czechoslovakia, a

ghort distance from Vienna.

He and his family then

drove to Lvor, USSR,

with a Soviet escort.

He was subsequently

exploited by the Soviets for propaganda purposes.

The actual propaganda

material was prepared by the KGB based on details furnished by

Dutkanicz.

In March 1962 the Soviets permitted his wife to return to

the United States, but the children were retained in the USSR. Dutkaniez

was allowed to accompany his wife to the US Embassy in Moscow for making

the necessary preparations for her return. During this period Dutkaniez

made a statement concerning his espionage activities in behalf of the

KGB.

USAREUR Comment

Although Dutkanicz's confession wad obtained under unusual circun-

stances, his statements

appear substantially true although obvioualy

incomplete.

A strong possibility exists that he worked for tho KGB for

a longer period than he admits, and 1t 1s probable that Dutkanicz pro-

vided the KGB with considerably more information than negative imminence

reports. His statement that his SIS recruiters were from Vienna is

possibly correct and is supported by his alleged defection route.

His

statement that he refused payment from the SIS seems unlikely, since he

reportedly was spending considerable amounts of money before his defection.

The case is of unusual significance since it constitutes one of the most

serious knom penetrations of USAREUR forces by hostilo Intelligence.

Also important is the fact that Dutkanicz's defection was apparently

instigated by the soviets for propaganda purposes after ho lost accees

to sensitive information.

Additional reports will be prepared as information becomes available.
