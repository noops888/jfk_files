Purpose and Scope of Study

The Central Intelligence Agency's performance
in its role of support to the Warren Commission
has been a source of controversy since the
inception of the Warren Commission. Critics
have repeatedly charged that the CIA participated
in a conspiracy designed to suppress information
relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy,

During 1976 the critic's

assertions a the subject of official inquiry
by the Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations (hereinafter SSC). The
SSC, in its report regarding "The Investication
of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy:
Performance of the Intelligence Agencies" reached
the following conclusion:

The Committee emphasizes that it has

not uncovered any evidence sufficient

to justify a conclusion that there was

a conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy.

The Committee has, however, developed
evidence which impeaches the process

0006000


by which the intelligence agencies
arrived at their own conclusions
about the assassination, and by
which they provided information

to the Warren Commission. This
evidence indicates that the
investigation of the assassina-
tion was deficient and that facts
which might have substantially
affected the course of the inves-
tigation were not provided the
Warren Commission or those
individuals within the FBI

Sought to examine in

The Committee has particularly focused its attention
on the specific issue of whether the CIA. or any
employee or former employee of the CIA misinformed,
or withheld information relevant to the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy from the Warren
Commission. In addition, the Committee has
attempted to determine whether, if the Warren
Commission was misinformed or not made privy. to
information relevant to its investigation,

the misinforming or withholding of

evidence from the Warren Commission was the

result of a conscious intent to do so by the
Agency or its employees.

The Committee has sought to examine the
issue detailed above in both an objective
and disciplined manner. In order to ec rad
this goal the Committee has utilized a a fash Ferce
Report bythe CIA's Inspector—Gereral (hereinafter
77 Ss. This Report was highly critical of
the SSC findings and asserted that the SSC
Final Report conveyed an impression of limited
effort by the CIA to assist the Warren Commission
in its work. The 17 tea was in fundamental
disagreement with this characterization of the
SSC findings and noted that "CIA did seek and
collect information in support of, the-widcen
Commission. additionally, ft conducted studies

In examining the Agency's comprehensive

the Committee has paralled its review to the :

aK
structure given to these materials by the 77 f6R.
In this regard the 77 3ex details four inter-
related compilations of Kennedy assassination
material. These four compilations are:

1) Agency dissemination of information

to the Intelligence Community (Formal

and Informal Disseminations)

2) Dissemination of material to the

Warren Commission

3) Agency dissemination to the FBI et al
regarding rumors and allegations
regarding President Kennedy's
assassination

4) Memorandum submitted by CIA to the

In réViewing these compilations,
the Committee focused upon those

CIA materials which the 77 I documented as having
made available in written form to the Warren
Commission.
During the course of this study, additional
Agency files have been reviewed. These files have
been examined in an effort to resolve certain
issues created by the review of the Agency's
compilations discussed in this report. Where
apparent gaps existed in the written record,

files have been requested and reviewed in an effort

to resolve these gaps. Where significant substantive

issues have arisen related to the kind and

quality of information provided the Warren

Commission, files have also been requested and
reviewed in an effort to resolve these issues.

As a result, approximately thirty files, comprising
an approximate total of ninety volumes:of

material have been examined and analyzed

in preparation of this report.

The findings set forth herein are subject
to modification due to the following considera-
tions. During the course of the past fifteen
years, the CIA has generated massive amounts of
information related to the assassination of
President Kennedy. In-spitetofothé-Agency's

TL. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select
Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for
Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the
investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely-supportive in the sense

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

States at all. So when I used here the
word "supportive," I meant that in the
literal sense of the term. We are (sic)

During the latter half of December, Scelso
issued a-summary report which described Oswald's
activities in Mexico City from September 26, 1963 -

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-

g Mr. Rocca. That was certainly the one that I would
Mr. Rocca. Again, I say that it would have
simply intensified it, that there was attention given
to it, not particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities
on the Cuban side.
The organization of their service and their
operation in Mexico was something entirely entirely (sic)
within -- it was an enigma at the time. They were just
getting started. This was WH+s area. This was Win-
Seett’s area of proficiency. So the defectors had only
begun to come out and they came out later, the Cuban
defectors.

So, I can't -- I really can't say that (a) the
Cuban connection was ignored, because it wasn't. The
press was filled with it at the time.

6 The Harker interview should have been undoubtedly
given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it
was given specific attention, I was told at the time of

Mr. Goldsmith. In what way was the Cuban connection
investigated?

A, Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of

the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of
g the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-
generated information to the Warren Commission.. The
6 general consensus of these representatives is that the
Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful
6 working relationship during the course of the Commission's
investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,
p. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,
ee =8/9/78, p. 24.) William Coleman,'a senior staff counsel
for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren
Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters
which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized
the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as
highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

All material bearing in any way that

issued very, very strictly worded
indications -- they were verbal in so

Mr.” Rocca added that, to his knowledge, Mr. Helms'
orders were followed to the letter by all CIA employees.

. (Ibid. ) .Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:
"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information
bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

a to the Warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the
supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was
propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as
the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren
Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the
CIA's investigation of President. Kennedy's assassination andthe

as teblighmenk of CA policy visa vio Nha Warren Commissions

w (Ibid., p. 23.) he testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

“Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard
Helms, 8/9/78, p- 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony
regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-
mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:°

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-

mission). We would attempt to respond to it.

But these inquiries came in individual bits and
pieces or as individual items...Each individual
item that came along we took care of as best we
could. (Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the CIA

provided information to the Warren Commission primarily

o06bS7


on the basis of the Commission's specific requests. Under

oath he supported this proposition:

Mr. Goldsmith: In summary, is it your position that
the Agency gave the Warren Commission
information only in response to speci-
fic requests by the Warren Commission?

Mr. Helms: That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that
memory is fallable. There may have been
times or circumstances under which some-
thing different might have occured, but
my recollection is that we were attempting
to be-responsive and supportive to the

FBI and the Warren Commission.

When

they asked for something we gave it to

them.

As far as our volunteering information
is concerned, I have no recollection of
whether we volunteered it or not.

(Ibid., p- 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

the extent of the Agency's compromise:

that the anti-Castro plots, in
fact, were relevant to the

in light of that, the Committee

why the Warren Commission was

Mr. Helms: I have never been asked to testify
before the Warren Commission about
our operations.

know of the operation, it certainly
was not in a position to ask you
about it.

Is that not true?

Mr. Helms: Yes, but how do you know they did

Mr. McCone testifed that he first became aware
of the CIA's anti-Castro assassination plots
involving CIA-Mafia ties during August 1963. He
stated that upon learning of these plots he directed
that the Agency cease all such activities. (HSCA

g. Agency Concern for the Sanctity

of Sensitive Sources and_ Methods - Factors Affecting

CIA Resporise’ to Warren’ Commission Requests
The length of time required by the CIA to

respond to the Warren Commission's requests for
information was dependent upon 1) the availability
of information; * 2) the complexity of the issues
presented by the request and 3) ‘the extent to which
the relevant informaties touched upon sensitive CIA
sources and methods. On the first two points, Mr.
Helms testified that when CIA had been able to
satisfy a Commission request, the CIA would then send
a reply back:

“and some of these inquiries obviously

took longer than others.
For example, some might involve

000049

checking a file which was in Washington.
Other inquiries might involve trying to
see if we could locate somebody in some
overseas country.
Obviously, one takes longer to per~
i form than the other. (Exec. Sess. Test.
J of Richard Helms, 8/9/78, p. 25

At times the CIA's concern for protecting its
sensitive sources and methods caused the Warren
Commission to experience greater difficulty in
getting relevant information than when the protec-
tion of such sources and methods was not at issue.

The Committee has identified two*areas of
concern in which the Agency's desire to protect its

Commission's investigation. These are:

1) Witholding information from the Warren

OAS Enitiok Concern far Revealing
Sensitive Sour ces ana Methods

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence
of sensitive technical operations, as outlined above,
was evident from the inception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized

at first to reveal all our technical operations.
V (Ibid., p. 158) But Scelso did testify that:

We were going to give them intelligence
reports which derived from all our sources,
including technical sources, including the
telephone intercept and the information
gotten from the interrogation of Silvia
Duran, for example, which corresponded
almost exactly with the information from
the telephone intercepts.

Mr. Scelsco's characterization is supported by
examination of the background to the first major CIA

report furnished the Warren Commission regarding

0000?



Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (CIA

poc. FOIA #509-803, 1/31/64, Memorandum for J.

Lee Rankin from Richard Helms) Much of the
information provided to the Warren Commission
in this. report was based upon sensitive sources
and methods, identification of which had been
deleted completely from the report.

The CIA policy limiting Warren Commission
knowledge of CIA sources and methods was articu-
lated as early as December 20, 1963, at which
time a cable was sent from CIA headquarters to
the Mexico City Station which stated:

Our present plan in vassing information

to the Warren Commission is to eliminate

mention of telephone taps, in order to
protect your continuing ops. Will rely
instead on statements of Silvia Duran

and on contents of Soviet Consular file

which Soviets gave ODACID (CIA Doc. FOIA
#420-757, 12/20/63, Dir 90466

The basic policy articulated in the December
20, 1963 cableAis’ also set forth in a CIA memorandum
of December 10, EG it specifically concerned

\ the CIA's relations with the FBI, (CIA Memorandum

for File, 12/20/63, includéd in with Soft

file materials) In that memorandum,

of the CIA Counterintelligence/Special Investigations

Group Staff wrote that he had been advised by Sam

G80G4E


Papich, FBI liaison to the CIA, that the FBI was
anticipating a request from the Warren Commission
for copies of the FBI's materials which supported
or complimented the FBI's five volume report of

December 9, 1963 that had been submitted to the

Warren Commission. Papich provide with

this report which indicated that some United
States Agency was tapping telephones in Mexico
and asked him whether the FBI could supply the

Warren Commission with the source of the telephone

taps. memorandum shows that he discussed

this matter with Scelso. After a discussion
with Helms, Scelso was directed by Helms to prepare

CIA material to be passed to the Warren Commission.

yrote:



He (Scelso) was quite sure it was not

the Agency's desire to make available

to the Commission at least in this

manner--via the FBI-sensitive informa-~

tion which could relate to telephone

taps, (CIA Memo for File, 12/20/63, by

included in Soft File materials) *

*

The opinion expressed by Scelso as of December
20, 1963 was set forth on January 14, 1964 in a
formalized fashion. When Helms expressed his
concern regarding exposure by the FBI of Agency
sources to the Warren Commission. Helms wrote
that the CIA had become aware that the FBI had
already: e
called to the attention of the
Commission, through its attorney,
that we have information (as deter-
mined from Agency sources) coinciding
with the date when Oswald was in Mexico
City and which may have some bearing
on his activities while in that area.
(CIA dissemination to FBI, 1/14/64,

CIA # CSCI-3/779/510.

Mr. Helms further indicated that the CIA might
be called upon to provide additional information
acquired from checks of CIA records and agency
sources. He suggested that certain policies be
employed to enable CIA to work cooperatively
with the Commission in a manner which’ would
protect CIA information, sources and methods.
Among the policies articulated were two which
Helms claimed would enable the Agency to control

the flow of Agency originated information. In

this way the CIA could check the possibility of
revealing: its sources and methods inadvertantly.
The policies articulated were:


The CIA policy of eliminating reference to Agency
sensitive sources and methods is further revealed
by examination of an Agency cable, dated January 29,
1964, sent from CIA Headquarters to the CIA Mexico
City Station. (CIA Doc, FOIA #398-204, 1/29/64,

DIR 97829) This cable indicated that knowledge of
Agency sources and techniques was still being with-
held from the Warren Commission, and stated that on
Saturday, February'1, 1964, the CIA was to present

Telephone Taps

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform.the Warren Commission, at least
during. the initial stage of the Commission's work,
of the CIA's telephonic and photo surveillance
operations in Mexico City.
The reason for the sensitivity of these
telephone taps and surveillance was not
only becp@se it was sensitive from the
Agency's ‘standpoint, but the telephone
taps were running in conjunction with
the Mexican authorities and therefore,
iff this had become public knowledge,
it would have caused very bad feelings
between Mexico and the United States, -
, and that was the reason. (Exec. Sess.
“ Test. of Richard Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 51-52)

\ The CIA's unwillingness to inform the Warren
Commission in the early stages of its investigation
of the above-described surveillance operaticns is
a source of concern to this Committee. It is
indicative of an Agency policy designed to skew
in its favor the form and substance of information
the CIA felt uncomfortable providing the Warren
Commission. (HSCA Class. Depo. of John Scelso,

5/6/78, p. 158) This process might well have

hampered the Commission's ability to proceed in

000627


- 26 -

its investigation with all the facts before it.

As noted previously, on January 31, 1964,
the CIA provided the Warren Commission with a
memorandum that chronicled Lee Harvey Oswald's
Mexico City visit during September 26, 1963 -

(CIA Doc. FOIA #509-803 1/31/64)
October 3, 19637 That memorandum did not mention
that Oswald's various conversations with the. Cuban
and Soviet Embassy/Consulates had been tapped and

by the Agericy's Mexico City Station

subsequently transcribed? Furthermore, that memo-
randum did not qeneion that the CIA had tapped
and transcribed conversations between, Cuban Embassy
employee Sylvia Duran and Soviet officials at the
Soviet Embassy/Consulate nor was mention made of
the conversations between Cuban President Dorticos
and Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Armas which ‘the CIA
had also tapped aad transcribed.

On February 1, 1964, Helms appeared before the
Commission and Likely) Giscussea the memorandum of
January 31, 1964. (CIA Doc. FOIA #498-204, 1/29/64,
DIR 97829) On February 10, 1964, J. Lee Rankin wrote

Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of January 31.

(JFK Doc. No. 3872) A review of Rankin's letter

008%



indicates that as of his writing, the Warren
Commission had no substantive knowledge of the
telephonic surveillance operation or the production
i.e., the tapes and transcripts from that operation.
Rankin inquired in the February 10, 1964 letter
whether Oswald's direct communication with employees
of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in Paragraph 1

of January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated by
telephone or interview. Manifestly, had‘the Warren
Commission been informed of the telephonic
surveillance operation and its success in tapping
Oswald this inquiry by Rankin would not have been
made.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support
this conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that
between the time period of January 1964 - April 1964,
Warren Commission's representatives had visited the
CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia and had
been shown various transcripts resulting from the
CIA's telephonic surveillance operations in Mexico
City. (HSCA Class. Depo. of Raymond Rocca, 7/17/78,

this material available to Commission representa-
tives and was not able to state under oath
precisely the point in time at which the Warren

Commission first learned of these operations. (Ib

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to
Rankin's inquiry of February 10. The Agency
response did indicate that Oswald had phoned the
Soviet Consulate and was also interviewed at the
Consulate. However, the Agency neither revealed
the source of this information in its response to
the Commission nor indicated that this source
would be revealed by other means (e.g. by oral

briefing). (Ibid.)

Warren Commission Knowledge cf CIA Telephonic Surveillance

During the period of March ~ April 1964,
David Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which
among other issues concerned Warren Commission know-
ledge of and access to the production material
derived from the CIA telephonic surveillance operations
in Mexico City. A review of these memoranda tends
to support the Committee's belief that the Warren

Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman, and

000650


and Willens did not obtain access to CIA telephonic
surveillance materials until April 9, 1964. On
that date, Coleman, Slawson and Willens met with
Win Scott, the CIA's Chief of Station in Mexico
City, who provided them with various transcripts
and translations derived from CIA telephone taps
of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy/Consulates. (Slawson
Memorandum of April 22, 1964, Subject: Trip to
Mexico City pas)

Prior to April 9,it appears doubtful that
the Commission had been given even partial access
to the referenced material. Nevertheless, by March
12, 1964, the record indicates that the Warren
Commission had at least become aware that the CIA
aid maintain telephonic surveillance of the Cuban
Embassy/Consulate. (Slawson memorandum, March 12,
1964, Subj: meeting with CIA representatives) .
Slawson's memorandum of March 12 reveals that. the Warren
Commission had learned that the CIA possessed tran-
scripts of conversations between the Cuban Ambassador
to Mexico, Armas, and the Cuban President Dorticos. The

Dorticos-Armas conversations, requested by the Warren

Commission representatives at meeting 3 with

CIA officials, including Richard Helms,. concerned
Silvia Duran's arrest and interrogation by the
Mexican Federal Police. (Slawson Memorandum of
April 22, 1964, pp. 3, 19, 45-46) Helms responded
to the Commission's request for access, stating
that he would attempt to arrange for the Warren
Commission's representatives to review this material.
(Slawson Memorandum of March 12, 1964, p. 6)

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25,
1964 concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. In that memo
Slawson wrote that the tentative conclusions
he had reached concerning Oswald's Mexico trip,
were derived from CIA memoranda of January 31, 1964
and February 19, 1964, (Slawson Memorandum of March
25, 1964, p. 20) and, in addition, a Mexican federal

police summary of esas u tes BEBOP ay

% Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report)

is simply a summation of what the Mexican
police learned when they interrogated Mrs.
Silvia Duran, an employee of the Cuban
Consulate in Mexico City, and.is there-
fore only as accurate as Mrs. Duran's
testimony to the police. (Ibid.)

These comments indicate that Slawson placed

qualified reliance upon the Mexican police summary.

Moreover, there is no indication that Slawson had
been provided the Duran telephonic intercept tran-
scripts. In fact, by virtue of Slawson's comments
concerning the Mexican police report, it would

appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,
had been provided little substantive information
pertaining to Silvia Duran. As Slawson reveals,

the Commission had been forced to rely upon the two
memoranda that did not make reference to the surveil-
lance operations, and a summary report issued by

the Mexican Federal Police. Thus, the Agency had

“(Slawson Memorandum of April 21, 1964, Subj: Intercepts |

The Committee's belief that Slawson had
Jelephense where
not been given access to the Duran‘transcripts 1s
further supported by reference to his memorandum
of March 27, 1964 (CD 692) wherein he states his
conclusion that Oswald had visited the Cuban
Embassy on three occasions. (Ibid, p. 2) This
colet ic tesermt es based upon an analysis of
Silvia Duran's testimony before the Mexican police.
This memorandum bears no indication that he had
reviewed any of the Duran transcripts. Furthermore,
had Slawson been given access to these transcripts,
certainly their substance would have been incorporated
into his analysis and accordingly noted for this
purpose. His analysis would have reflected the fact
of his review either by its corroboration or
criticism of the above cited Mexican police summary report.
Logically, access to the CIA's telephonic

surveillance production would have clarified some

ambiguities. For example, on September 27, at 4:05 p.m.



Silvia Duran telephoned the Soviet Embassy, and
stated that an American was presently at the
Cuban Embassy requesting an in-transit visit to
Cuba. This American was later determined by CIA analysts
to be Oswald. Again on September 28, at 11:51 a.m.
Duran telephoned the Soviet Consulate stating that

series of telephonic intercepts. ‘ AY memorandum of
that date by Coleman and Slawson, posed one

question to the CIA and made two. requestsfor information
from the Agency. (Slawson - Coleman Memorandum of

April 2, 1964, Subj: Questions Raised by the Ambassador
Mann File) Coleman and Slawson wrote:

1) What is the information source referred

to in the November 28 telegram that

Oswald intended to settle down in
Odessa;

2) We would like to see copies of the
transcripts of the intercepts, translated
if possible, in all cases where the
intercepts refer to the assassination
or related subjects;

3) We would especially like to see the
intercept in which the allegation that
money was passed at the Cuban Embassy
is discussed (Ibid.)

1

The question initially posed by (Item Do in
the above-referenced memorandum of April 2 concerns
the CIA telephonic intercept of September 27, 1963
at 10:37 a.m. (Slawson Memorandum of April 21,
1964, p. 1) Obviously, if Slawson found it necessary
to request the source of the information, he had
not as yet been provided access to the original
material by the CIA.

Item Number Two of the above listing tends to show

that the Commission had not been giveéng access to the intercepts

concerning the assassination.



Item number three of the above listing

reveals that the intercept of the Dorticos-Armas

conversation of November 22, 1964, in which the
passing of monies was discussed had not as of April
3 2 been provided to the Commission. The commission
had specifically requested the Dorticos-Armas
transcripts at @ March 12, 1964 meeting between
Commission representatives and Agency representatives.
(Slawson memorandum, March 12, 1964, Subj: Conference
with CIA on March 12, 1964

On April 3, 1964, Coleman and Slawson expressed
their concern for receiving complete access to all

materials relevant to Oswald's Mexico City trip:

The most probable final result of the
entire investigation of Oswald's activities
in Mexico is a conclusion that he went
there for the purpose of trying to reach
Cuba and that no bribes, conspiracies,

etc. took place.

..-In_ order to make such a judgment (that

all reasonable lines of investigation that

might have uncovered other motivations or

possible conspiracies have been followed

through with negative results), we must

become familiar with the details of what

both the American and Mexican investi-

gatory agencies there have done. This

means reading their reports, after trans-

lation, if necessary, and in some cases

talking with the investigators themselves.

(Slawson'and Coleman Memorandum, April

13, 1964, Subj: Additional lines of
Investigation in Mexico Which May Prove
Worthwhile, p. 11.)

Manifestly,. Coleman's and Slawson's desire

for a thorough investigation had been

the CIA's concern lest its sources and methods,

however relevant to the Commission's investigation,

be exposed. Considering the-gravity and signi-

ficance of the Warren Commission's investigation
the

Agency's witholding of material from the

Commission staff was clearly improper.

1964
On April 8, David Slawson, Howard Willens,

and William Coleman flew to Mexico City, Mexico

to meet with the representatives of the State
Department, FBI, CIA, and the Government of Mexico.
(Slawson Memorandum, April 22, 1964, Subj: Trip

to Mexico City, p. 1) Prior to their departure,

they met with Thomas Mann, the U.S. Ambassador to
Mexico during Oswald's visit to Mexico'City and at
the time of President Kennedy's assassination. (Ibid.)
Ambassador Mann told the Warren Commission representa-
tives that the CIA's Mexico City Station was actively
engaged in photosurveillance operations against the
Soviet and Cuban Embassy/Consulates (Ibid., p. 3)

Upon the group's arrival in Mexico City, they
were met by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra
of the State Department, Clarke Anderson of the FBI,
and Winston Scott of the CIA (Ibid. pp. 9-10

That same day, during a meeting between the
Commission representatives and Win Scott, Scott made
available to the group actual transcripts of the CIA's
telephonic surveillance operations accompanied with

that we would not disclose beyond the
confines of the Commission and its

agreed to this." (Ibid.)

(Ibid.) Scott revealed, that all known Cuban and Russian

intelligence agents Had “quickly been put under
surveillance following the assassination. Slawson
concluded

“Scott's narrative plus the material we

were shown disclosed immediately how

incorrect our previous information had

been on Oswald's contacts with the Soviet

and Mexsrean Embassies. Apparently the

distortions and omissions to which our
information had been subjected had

entered some place in Washington,

because the CIA information that we

were shown by Scott was unambiguous on
almost all the crucial-points. We had
previously planned to show Scott, Slawson's
reconstruction of Oswald's probable
activities at the embassies to get Scott's
opinion, but once we saw how badly distorted
our information was we realized that this
would be useless. Therefore, instead, we*
decided to take as close notes as possible
from the original source materials at some
later time during our visit." (Ibid, p. 24)*

« A separate Slawson memorandum of April 21, [964 records
the results of the notetaking from original source

materials that he did following Scott's disclosures.

These notes dealt exclusively with the telephonic

intercepts pertaining to the Duran and Oswald conver-

sations for the period Sept. 27 - Oct. 1, 1963.

(Slawson Memorandum, April 21, 1964 Subj: Intercepts

from the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in -Mexico City.

It is evident from Slawson's record that the
Agency's denial of original source materials, in this
case the telephonic surveillance intercepts, seriously
impaired the Commission's ability to draw. accurately
reasoned conclusions regarding Oswald's sojourn in

Mexico City. It meant that as of April 10, 1964,

“We did not initially disclose to the

Ji 7 Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President

Kennedy's assassination a Cuban government employee
in Mexico City named "Luisa" received a telephone
cali‘ ?rom an unidentified man speaking Spanish.
(CIA noc. voter 7105, 11/27/63) 173-615, attachment)
This call had been intercepted and recorded by the
CIA's Mexico city Station as the result of its
LIENVOY (tel. tap) operation. (Ibid.) The Mexico

ft City Station,as subsequently reported to CIA
headquarters, identified the Luisa of the conversa-

tion as Luisa Calderon, who was then employed in

the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban Consu-

late. (Ibid.)

During the course of the conversation, the

unidentified caller asked Luisa if she had heard - Ww

the latest news. Luisa replied in a §oking tone:

"Yes, of course, I. knew almost before Kennedy."

Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto
suggestion of foreknowledge. This is the
only item in the intercept coverage of

the Cubans and Soviets after the assassina-
tion that contains the suggestion of fore-
knowlege of expectation. (CIA Doc.,
Memorandum of Raymond Rocca for DC/OPS,
5/23/75, Pp. 15) * (gee p.8 Sa Sor

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic
comments do not merit serious attention. Her words
may indeed indicate foreknowledge of the assassina-
tion but may equally be interpreted without such a
sinister implication. Nevertheless, the Committee
has determined that. Luisa Calderon's case should

have merited serious attention in the months following

the assassination.

In connection with the assassination, Luisa
Calderon's name first surfaced on November 27, 1963
in a cable sent by then Ambassador Mann to the State
Department (CIA Doc. DIR’85573, 11/27/63).

In that cable Mann stated:

.-Washington should urgently consider
feasibility of requesting Mexican authorities
to arrest for interrogation: Eusebio Azcue,
Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal. The two
men-are Cuban national and Cuban consular

officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary
in Cuban Consulate here." (ibid.)

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments
could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible
foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,
Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

the Agency's Cuban and Soviet telephone
intercepts that might suggest foreknowledge
of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether: she
had heard the latest news, Calderon said:
"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me enfere
(the first person of the verb enterarsefle,
past tense) should be translated as -I found _

out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination/
almost before Kennedy /did/7." In other words, ~
Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1)

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's

comments as a suggestion on hér part of possible

foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

Calderon had connections to intelligence work,

as did other Cuban Embassy officers, the vital

link between her background and her comments

was never established for the Warren Commission

by the CIA. The Agency's oversight-in this

regard may have forclosed the Commission from

actively pursuing a lead of great significance.
Calderon's-201 file reveals that she

arrived in Mexico City from Havana on January 16,

1963, carrying Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date

of birth was believed to be 1940 (CIA Doc. Dispatch

HMMA21612, no date given) Calderon's presence in

Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July

15, 1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field

office to the CIA's Mexico City station and to the

Chief of the CIA's Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban

operations). (CIA Doc. Dispatch, JFCA-10095, 7/15/63)

That dispatch had attached to it a report containing

biographic data on personnel then assigned to the

Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. At page three of the

attached report Luisa Calderon was listed as Secretary

of the Cuban Embassy's commercial office. The

the report.

Luisa Calderon's association with the Cuban
DGI was first recorded by the CIA on May 5, 1964
(CIA Doc.“Biind Nemozandum oF Harold Swensony FOIA
68-290 5/5/64) At that time, Joseph Langosch,
Chief of Counterintelligence for the Special Affairs
Staff, reported the results of his debriefing of
the Cuban defector, AMMUG-1. The memorandum stated
that AMMUG-1 had no direct knowledge of Lee Harvey
Oswald or his activities but was able to provide
items of interest based upon the comments of certain
Cuban Intelligence Service officers. (Ibid.). Specifically,
AMMUG-1 was asked if Oswald was known to the Cuban
intelligence services before November 23, 1963
AMMUG-1 told Langosch "Prior to October 1963, Oswald
visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on two or
three. occasions. Before, during and after these

visits, Oswald was in contact with the Direccion

General De Intelligencia (DGI), specifically
with Luisa Calderon, Manuel Vega Perez, and
Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez." (Ibid.)

Langosch thereafter wrote that Calderon's
precise relationship to the DGI was not clear.

As a comment to this statement he set forth the

CIA cable and dispatch traffic which recorded her

arrival in Mexico during January 1963 and departure
for Cuba within one month after the assassination.
(Ibid. )

On May 7, 1964, Langosch recorded additional
information he had elicited from AMMUG-1 regarding
Oswald's possible contact with the DGI. (CIA Doc
FOIA 687-295, attach. 3, 5/7/64) Paragraph 3 of

this memorandum stated in part:
"a. Luisa Calderon, since she returned
to Cuba, has been paid a regular
salary by the DGI even though she
has not performed any services.
Her home is’in the Vedado section
where the rents are high.

b. Source (AMMUG) has known Calderon
for several years. Before going
to Mexico, she worked in the
Ministry of Exterior Commerce

as the "Empress Transimport."

Her title was Secretary General

department named in the previous
sentence. (Ibid.)

On May 8 Langosch further disclosed AMMUG's
knowledge of the Oswald case. (Ibid, attach. 5)
Langosch paraphrased AMMUG's knowledge of Calderon

as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned
about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made
a trip to Mexico, that she had been
involved with an American in Mexico. The
information to which I refer was told to
me by a DGI case officer... I had commented
to (him) that it seemed strange that iuisa
Calderon was receiving a salary from the
DGI although she apparently did not do

any work for the Service. (The case officer)
told me that hers was’ a peculiar case and
that he himself believed that she had been
recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence
Agency although Manuel Piheiro, the Head

of the DGI, did not agree. As I recall,
(the case officer) had investigated Luisa
Calderon. This was because, during the time
she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted
a letter to her by an American who signed
his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in
Spanish so I am not sure of how the name
mentioned by Hernandez should be spelled.
It could have been "Howard" or something
different. As I’ understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love
letter but indicated that there was a
clandestine professional relationship
between the writer and Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the case officer)
that after the interception of the letter
she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American. I do not know. if
this could have been Oswald... (Ibid.)

On May 11, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum
to Director Richard Helms regarding the information
Swenson had elicited from AMMUG (CIA Doc. FOIA 687-295,
5/11/64, Rocca Memorandum) Rocca proposed that "the
DDP in person or via a designee, perferably the
former, discuss the AMMUG-1 situation on a very
restricted basis with Mr. Rankin at his earliest
convenience either at the Agency or at the Commission
headquarters. Until this takes place, it is not
desirable to put anything in writing: (Ibid. p. 2)

On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding
AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its
sensitivity and operational significance. (CIA Doc.
FOIA 697-294, 5/15/64, Helms Memorandum) Attached
to Helms' communication was a paraphrased accounting
of Langosch's May 5 memorandum. (Ibid.) In that
attachment the intelligence associations of Manuel
Vega Perez and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez were set forth.
However, that attachment made no reference whatsoever
to Luisa Calderon.

Rocca!s @ounterintelligence Research and Analysis
Group took the questions and AMMUG's responses to

mention of Calderon was as follows: "The precise
relationship of-Luisa Calderon to the DGI is not
clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from
which she returned to Cuba early in 1964." (Ibid.)
However, Willens was not shown Langosch's
memorandy, of May 7 and May 8, 1964 which contained
much more detailed information on Luisa Calderon,
including her possible association with Lee Harvey
Oswald and/or American intelligence. (Ibid.)*

The Warren Commission as of June 19, 1964,

lead. It had effectively been denied significant

background information. This denial may have
impeded or prevented the Commission's pursuit

of Calderon's poténtial relationship to Oswald

and the assassination of President Kennedy. But
even if the Warren Commission had learned

of Calderon's background and possible contact with
Oswald it still had been denied the one significant
piece of information that might haveraised its
interest in Calderon to a more serious level. The
Warren Commission was never told about Calderon's

conversation of November 22, 1964

The Committee has contacted former Commission
and CIA representatives in an effort to determine whether
a transcript of the Calderon conversation was
ever shown to the Warren Commission. The response
i # has uniformly been that the Calderon
conversation was never made available to the Commission

nor was its existence ever made known to the Commission.

orally or in writing of the substance of the

above-referenced conversation of November 22,

1963? If so, please indicate when and

in what form this information was provided,
¢ and which CIA official provided it. (HSCA

request letter of August 28, 1978)
The CIA responded by memorandum:

"Although the (Mexico City) Station considered
the conversation of sufficient possible
interest to send a copy to headquarters,
the latter apparently did nothing with
it, for there appears to be no record in the
Oswald file of such action as may have
been taken. A review of those Warren
Commission documents containing information
provided by the Agency and still bearing a
Secret or Top Secret classification does
not reveal whether the conversation was
given or shown to the Commission."

(CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding Luisa

Calderon conversation, p. 1

The available evidence thus supports the
conclusion that the Warren Commission was never
given the information nor the opportunity by

which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's

Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been
expeditiously provided this evidence of her
intelligence background, association with Silvia

consideration to her potential knowledge of Oswald
and the Cuban government's possible involvement in
a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.

Two difficult issues remain which are raised

ae i by the Committee's finding. First, why didn't
the Agency provide the Calderon conversation to the
Warren Commission; secondly, why didn't the Agency
reveal to the Warren Commission its full knowledge
of Calderon's intelligence background, her possible
knowledge of Oswald and her possible connection to
the CIA or some other American intelligence apparatus
ay The first question can be explained in benign
phar terms. It is reasonably possible that by sheer
oversight the conversation was filed away and not

recovered or recollected until after the Warren

Commission had completed its investigation and F Pa
(gee p OS) Cirller porrion asctoetnate herein
published its report.” (See above CIA explanation)
As for the Agency's withholding of information
concerning Calderon's intelligence background, the
record reflects that the Commission was merely
informed that Calderon may have been a member of
n the DGI. (CIA Doc. 5/5/64, Swenson Memorandum)

The memoranda which provided more extensive examina-

tion of her intelligence background were not made


available for the Commission's review. Significantly,
the May 8 memorandum written by Joseph Langosch
following his debriefing of AMMUG-1 indicated that
AMMUG-1 and a second Cuban Intelligence officer ~
believed Calderon to be a CIA operative. (CIA Doc.
FOIA 687-295, attach 5, 5/8/64) It is possible

that this information was not provided the Warren
Commission either because there was no basis in

fact for the allegation or because the allegation
was of substantive concern to the Agency. If the
allegation were true, the consequences for the CIA
would have been serious. It would have demonstrated

SS ie
that a\CIA operative, well placed in the Cuban Embassy,

may have possessed information prior to the assassina-
tion regarding Oswald and/or his relationship to the
Cuban Intelligence Service , and that Services
possible involvement in a conspiracy to assassinate
President Kennedy.

Regarding Calderon's possible association
with the CIA, Agency files reviewed reveal no

ostensible connection between Calderon and the CIA.

000698


However, there are indications that such contact
between Calderon and the Agency was contemplated.
A September 1, 1963 CIA dispatch from the Chief
of the Special Affairs Staff to the CIA's Chief
of Station in Mexico City states in part:
..-Luisa Calderon has a sister residing
in Reynosa, Texas, married to an American
of Mexican descent. If (CIA asset) can
further identify the sister, our domestic
exploitation section might be in a posi-
tion to follow up on this lead...Please
levy the requirement on (CIA asset) at

the next opportunity. (CIA Doc. HMMW-
1935, 9/1/63)

An earlier CIA dispatch from the CIA Chief
of Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the CIA's
Western Hemisphere Division records that:
Wilfredo of the Cuban Consulate, Tampico,
reported that Luisa Calderon has a sister
residing in Reynosa, Texas...Luisa may go
up to the border to. visit her sister soon--
or her mother may make the trip--details
not clear (CIA Doc. HMMA 21849, July 31,
1965)
At the very least, the above dispatches
evidenced an interest in the activities of Calderon
and her family. Whether this interest took

the form of a clandestine-agent relationship is

not revealed by Calderon's 201 file.

The Committee has queried David Ronis, the

author of the above cited dispatch requesting

that Calderon's sister be contacted by the CIA's
“domestic exploitation section." (HSCA Class.

Staff Interview of David Ronis, 8/31/78) Ronis

was a member of the CIA's Special Affairs Staff

at the time he wrote the dispatch. He worked
principally at CIA headquarters and was responsible
for recruitment and handling of agents for collection
of intelligence data. Mr. Ronis, when interviewed
by this Committee, stated that part of his responsi-
bility was to scour the Western Hemisphere division

normally would send requests to CIA field stations

he would receive no response to these requests,
which normally indicatea that no follow-up had
either been attempted or successfully conducted.

domestic exploitation section was a task force

within the Special Affairs Staff. He also stated

that in 1963 the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division

might have been requested to locate Luisa Calderon's

sister. Ronis told the Committee that he had no

recollection of recruiting any person associated
with the Cuban Intelligence Service. He did recall
that he had recruited women to perform tasks for
the Agency. However, he did not recall ever recruiting
any employees of the Cuban Embassy/Consulate in
\ Mexico City. Finally, Mr. Ronis stated that he had
no recollection that Luisa Calderon was associated
with the CIA. (Ibid.)
Various present and former CIA representatives
were queried whether Luisa Calderon had ever been
ie associated with the CIA. The uniform answer was
that no one recalled such an association. (Cites:

This Committee's investigation of Luisa’

Calderon has revealed that a defector from the Cuban
Intelligence Services provided the CIA with signi-
ficant information about Lee Harvey Oswald's contacts
with the DGI in Mexico City. This defector was

pr

assigned the CIA cryptonym AMMUG-1 (A-1 hereinafter) .*

CIA files reveal that A-1 defected from the

DSI on April 21, 1964 in

When he defected, A-1 possessed a number of DGI

documents which were subsequently turned over to

the CIA. (CIA poc,| tn 69894, 4/24/64)

Following his defection, a CIA officer, Joseph H.

Langosch, went to -6 meet A-1, debrief him,

and arrange for A-i's travel into the United States.

(CIA Doc. Contract Approving Officer Memo, 6/6/64)

pv By ‘June 23, 1964, Langosch was convinced that A

would be of great value to the Agency. He stated:

There is no. question in my mind that
AMMUG-1 is a bona fide defector or

that he has furnished us with accurate

( I might say that some of these names
are familiar to me.) (Langosch debriefing
of A-1, 4/30/64, p. 5 of reel 4, 4/23/64)

Thus, A-1l was able to provide the CIA soon
_ after his defection with accurate information
regarding DGI operations and DGI employees in

Mexico City. HK Tn sect Aen prz

The Committee has reviewed the CIA's files
concerning A-]. This examination was undertaken
to determine: 1) whether A-1 had provided any
valuable investigative leads to the CIA pertaining
to the assassination of President Kennedy; and 2
whether, if such leads were provided, these leads

\ and/or other significant information were made

available to the Warren Commission.

The Committee's ‘initial review of the
materials provided by the CIA to the Warren
Commission did not disclose the existence of the
AMMUG files\ However, the Committee did during
the course of its review examine a file containing ‘
material passed to the Rockefeller Commission. That
file made reference to A-1l. Included in this
file was a memorandum of May 5, 1964 written by
Joseph Langosch which concerned information A-1
provided about the Oswald case. (CIA Doc. FOIA 68-290
Langosch Memorandum, 5/5/64) Also contained within
this file were the A-1 debriefing memoranda of
May 7, and May 8, 1964 previously cited with regard
to Luisa Calderon. (CIA Doc. FOIA #687-295, attach's
3 and 5) Following review of the memoranda, the
Committee requested access to all CIA files
are ee to A-1l.

From review of these materials the Committee
has determined that the Warren Commission did learn
during mid-May 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald probably

had come in contact with DGI officers in Mexico City.


the Waren Commission
Prior to“learning of Oswald's probable contact

with DGI officers, James Angleton, Chief of the
CIA's Counter Intelligence Staff passed an internal
memorandum to Raymond Rocca, also of the Counter-
intelligence Staff, which stated that he had been
informed by the DDP, Richard Helms, that J. Lee
Rankin had contacted John McCone to request that
the Director consent to an interview before the
Warren Commission on May 14, 1964, (J. Edgar
Hoover also appeared before the Commission on
that date prior to McCone's appearance. Warren

sia

to in Angleton's memowas A-1. This conclusion is

based in part upon the date of this memo which

was quite close in time to A-l's defection. In
addition, Rocca's staff prepared prior

to DCI McCone's appearance before the Warren
a"Brief r
Commission for Presentation to the Warren Commission

outlining various positions adopted by the CIA vis a
vis its investigative efforts and assistance to the
Commission. (CIA Doc. FOIA 695-302-A, 5/14/64

At Tab E of this brief it states:

mation has been developed by the CIA re-
garding the relationship with Oswald of
certain Cuban intelligence personnel in
Mexico City and the reaction in Havana
within the Cuban Intelligence Service

to. the news of the assassination of
President Kennedy. The Commission Staff
is in the course of being briefed on the
Cuban asspect. (Ibid., Tab E)

On May 15, 1964, the day of McConé's interview,
the Warren Commission received its first formal
communication regarding A-1. (CIA Doc FOTIA 697-294,
5/15/64). However, the Agency did not at that time
identify A-l by his real name or cryptonym nor did

the Agency indicate that the source of this information

000609


was a defector then residing under secure conditions
in the Washington, D.C. area. (Ibid.) The May 15
communication did state that the Agency had
established contact “with a well-placed invidivual
who has been in close and prolonged contact with
ranking officers of the Cuban Direccion General de
Intelligencia." (Ibid.)

Attached to the May 15 communication was a
copy of Langosch's above referenced memorandum of
May 5, 1964 regarding knowledge of Oswald's pro-
bable contact with the DGI in’Mexico City. The
attachment made no reference to the source's status
as a defector from the DGI. (Ibid.,. attachment)

As set forth in the section of this report
concerning Luisa Calderon, on June 18, 1964, Howard
Willens of the Warren Commission reviewed Langosch's
May 5 memo and the questions upon which the informa-
tion set forth in the Memo.was elicited. Neither the
questions nor the memo shown to Willens made
reference to the source's status as a defector col-
laborating with the CIA. (CIA Doc FOIA 739-319,

Based upon review of the Langosch memoranda,

in its review the Committee has determined that a

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-1's defection
and considered the possibility that he

might have some knowledge of the Oswald
case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions
to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing
AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that
AMMUG-1 was debriefed on 4 May 64 regarding
this questionnaire... /B/ecause the debriefing
on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive
matter, it was dictated directly to a CI
(Counterintelligence) stenographer on

5 May 1964. /Note: A-1 was debriefed on
several subjects on 4 May 64. The procedure
was to assign each subject discussed a
debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case
officer. The instructions from CI staff
were to handle the Oswald case debriefing
very closely and not to keep any copies in
WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing
report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly
to a CI staff stenographer. There would

be no reason to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for

CI staff, since it was their only debriefing
report. We are certain it is the debriefing
report (#40) becausé the date is the’ same;
it is the only debriefing report on Oswald
listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)
the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in
Oswald's 201 file.

In a further effort to clarify the substance
of information that A-1 provided to the CIA

The AMLASH Operation C+e 8* ine eae Sarat

During 1967, the CIA's Inspector General
‘i issued a report which examined CIA supported

assassination plots. Included in this report

was discussion of the CIA-Mafia plots and an

009106



Agency project referred to as the AMLASH

operation (CIA Inspector General Report 1967

pp. 1-74, 78-112). The AMLASH operation involved

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA
cryptonym AMLASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting
with a CIA representative expressed the desire to
assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., p. 84). Asa
result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the
CIA's desire to find a viable political. alternative
to the Castro regime, the Agency subsequently
provided AMLASH with both moral and material
support designed to depose Fidel Castro. (Ibid.,

<= PP:

by the CIA in 1965 as the result of security leaks.

80-94).. The AMLASH operation was terminated

(Ibid. pp. 104-106) During 1965, AMLASH and his
conspirators were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting
against Castro. AMLASH was sentenced to death, but
at Castro's request the sentence was reduced to
twenty-five years imprisonment. (Ibid.. pp. 107-110).

\ In its examination of the AMLASH operation

the 1967 IGR concluded that the CIA had offered both

direct and indirect support for AMLASH's plotting (Ibid. p. 80

9gaie7


The most striking example of the CIA's direct

offer of support to AMLASH reported by the

1967 IGR states "it is likely that at the very
moment President Kennedy was shot a CIA officer

was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris and giving
him an assassination device for use against CASTRO."
(Ibid.)

The 1967 IGR offered no firm evidence confirming
or refuting Castro's knowledge of the AMLASH operation
prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. The
1967 IGR did note that in 1965 when AMLASH was
tried inMpavanasgress reports of Cuban knowledge
of AMLASH's ‘association with the CIAweredated from
November 1964, approximately one year after President
Kennedy's assassination. (Ipid. p. 111).

The Church Committee in Book V of its Final
Report examined the AMLASH operation in great detail.
(S8c, Book V, pp. 2-7, 67-69) ~ The Church Committee
concluded:

The AMLASH plot was more relevant to the

Warren Commision work than the early CIA

assassination plots with the underworld.

operation was in progress at the time
of the assassination; unlike the earlier
plots, the AMLASH operation could
clearly be traced to. the CIA; and

unlike. the earlier plots, the CIA had
endorsed AMLASH'’s proposal for a coup,
the first step to him being Castro's
assassination, despite Castro's threat
to retaliate for such plotting. No one
directly involved in either investigation
(i.e. the CIA and the FBI) was told of
the AMLASH operation. No one investi-
gated a connection between the AMLASH
operation and President Kennedy's
assassination. Although Oswald had been
in contact with pro-Castro and anti-
Castro groups for many months before the
assassination, the CIA did not conduct

a thorough investigation of questions

of Cuban government or Cuban exile

involvement in the assassination. (Ibid. p. 5)

0001

S


In 1977, the CIA issued a second Inspeetor
General's Report concerning the subject of CIA
sponsored assassination plots. This Report, in
large part, was intended as a rebuttal of the
Church Committee's findings. The 1977 IGR states:

The Report (of the Church Committee)

assigns it (the AMLASH operation)

characteristics that it did not have
during the period preceding the assassina-
tion of JFK in order to support the SSC
view that it should have been reported

to the Warren Commission. (1977 IGR p. 2)

The 1977 IGR concluded that prior to the
assassination of President Kennedy, the AMLASH
operation was not an assassination plot.

Nevertheless, the 1977 IGR did state:

It would have served to reinforce the

credibility of (the Warren Commission)

its efforts had it taken a broader view

of the matter (of normal avenue of

investigation). The CIA, too, could

have considered in specific. terms

what most then saw in general terms-~

the possibility of Soviet or Cuban

involvement in the assassination

because of the tensions of the time.
It is not enough to be able to point

900110


to erroneous criticisms made today.

The Agency should have taken broader

initiatives then as well. That

CIA employees at the time felt--as

they obviously did--that the activities

about which they knew had no relevance

to the Warren Commission inquiry does

not take the place of a record of ;

conscious review. (Ibid. p. 11) »

Richard Helms, as the highest level CIA
employee in contact with the Warren Commission on
a regular basis, testified to the Rockefeller
Commission that he did not believe the AMLASH
operation was relevant to the investigation of
President Kennedy's death. (Rockefeller Commission,

/

Testimony of Richard Helms, 4/24/75 pp. 389-391,392) ¥
In addition, Mr. Helms testified before this
Committee that the AMLASH operation was not designed
to be an assassination plot (Exec. Sess. Test. of
Richard Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 26-27) .v

A contrasting. view to the testimony of Mr.
Helms was offered by Joseph Langosch who in 1963
was the Chief of Counterintelligence for the CIA's Special

Affai

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this
Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who "served
as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the
entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs
Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it
progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent L. Pollock,
executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1)¥ Mr. Pollock specifically
contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation
was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond
FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an
assassination operation. In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald
considered the AMLASH operation to be a political
action activity with the objective of organizing
a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the
Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. I heard
Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation
frequently, and never heard him characterize it as
an "assassiaf}tion operation." Mr. FitzGerald
stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves
loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH
operation as an "assassi, ion operation"; the

case officer did not; I, -as Executive Officer, never
discussed any aspect of the AMLASH’ operation with
Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other
branch chiefs and the special assistants could not
have so characterized it since they did not know
about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a
hypodermic, syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH
for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day
of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the
pen with disdain. /Tbid., par. 4, p. 2/), (Ibid.,

not simply whether the AMLASH operation was an
assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's
death. ‘The broader and more significant issue,
as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether
the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy
to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this
determination is a most difficult matter to
resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their
characterization of the Agency's operational
objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence
it is the Committee's position that such informa-
tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,
might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-
tive concern for possible Cuban involvement or
complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin
commented before this Committee:

..-when I read...the Church Committee's

report--it was an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met

and then either blame the rest of it

on somebody else or not tell any more
or polish it off. I don't think that
