MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : HSCA and Mexico City

Yesterday morning Mr. Blakey, in the prologue that

he gives prior to testimony, made statements as follows:

"the Cuban Government has suggested that pictures

should exist of....the Consulate taken from a

surveillance camera....the Cuban Government has

provided photographs of the surveillance site

(Blakey entered into record)....the Committee

has investigated who was responsible for the

surveillance....and sought to interview the

person(s) who operated the site....no pictures

of LHO have been located....."

He had told us no mention would be made of CIA photographic

or telephone operations in Mexico. This obviously raises

the question directly.

2.

At a meeting yesterday afternoon with one of the

senior staff members, Mr. Goldsmith, I complained about

ment; observing that there was a commitment to avoid such

It struck me as strange that this source was

used as a way to get it into the record anyway.

Observing that the HSCA was concerned with its

credibility I asked how it would seem to the press if the

Committee appeared as hand maiden of the Cuban government

in its current propaganda attack on CIA. I said we

could not approach the press, but HSCA should be aware

of how alert the press is to such things.

4.

I reminded him that we had sought a hearing in

executive session on the Nosenko and Mexico subjects,

and had been refused.

I was not renewing that request,

but reminded him of it to point up that the Committee had

not been denied the full story and I saw no excuse

in

Mr. Blakey's making these statements.

5.

I stated that we understand that they are follow-

ing a tactic of putting in something of everything on

all sides, but I felt there was a place for discrimiantion.

Reminding him that CIA is part of the U.S. Government, I

told him this inquiry is not a courtroom case, but involves

considerations of national importance and international

implications, and they should keep it in mind.

6.

Saying that I had not discussed the matter with

anyone in the Agency, I asked that he convey my personal

concern to Mr. Blakey. He said he would.
