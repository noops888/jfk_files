During all.of this period he had many occasions to
work directly with Mr. Helms and had a close working rela-

The beginning of 1961, he was asked by Mr. Bissell to’
explore the possibilities of setting up a "executive action

Georonier within CIA. In the Fall he was asked by Mr.
Bissell to turn his attention with regard to the general
area of executive action to the specific target of Castro

and, particularly, to take over one ongoing operation from

the Office of Security. Shortly thereafter, but as a distintt

matter, Mr. Helms (who was clearly slated to take over DDP, Faegn

even while Mr. Bissell was still its nominal head) Asked
Harvey to set up Task Force W, to be the new working group

To summarize at the outset, the following is the thrust

of what Harvey would testify to regarding QJWIN/ZRRIFLE?

Harvey regarded ZRRIFLE as the overall project crypt under

which QJWIN as an asset operation was going forward. He. had

discussed with § qj the general assignment of exploring
executive action capability, and the possibility that eithe
QJWIN or that other criminals whom WIN helped to spot might
be assets. He never did more than review some of them as
possibilities in the course of his taking an inventory.
However, he did not use WIN or anyone WIN spotted in con-
nection with any assassination operations against Castro

Or otherwise, nor did he even discuss the concept with any

of them. He did not stockpile any materials or discuss pre

liminary targets or make plans or evaluations premised on

the technological, human asset, and organizational poten-
tials in being,or which might be organized, under the cland-
estine services, and came up with a pessimistic report to
Helms and Bissell that the possibilities of effective dis-
creet action were slim. He also concluded that it was
"ridiculous" to try and set up a general reserve capability
in being, aml counselled that the one sure way to do it, or
at least the only one close to having-a chance at secure
success,was to simply appoint a single senior officer to do

}
everything to run the operation, kill the person, bury the

body, arid. tell no one. In regard to Castro, he had used th
ZRRIELE project as the administrative hook for his billing
and so forth, and said that at some times there were mix-
ups in terms of the financing offices, so that QJWIN/ZRRIFL
might be used. He did not completely explain why on some
of his own bills he seems to have indicated QUWIN/
ZRRIFLE, but we did not have time to pursue this at greater
length, Whether he would regard this as his own slip or
indicate that to some extent they were written up by others
the bottom line is that he would swear that QUJWIN was never
involved_in_ an i xo operation -- nor, for
example, ever in the United States, although there is a
plane trip ticket from Miami to Chicago which is charged

to "QJWIN/ZRRIFLE" (Harvey says it was a plane trip of
Roselli's, which was the only thing he ever paid for of

Roselli's.)

_AVERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY i “page 7 of _

In early 1961 Bissell asked Harvey to explore an FILE:
executive action capability. Harvey confirmed and said he
firmly recalls that Bissell on at least two occasions indi-
cated to Harvey that he, Bissell, had been repeatedly im-
portuned by the White House to explore such a capability.
The first time Bissell spoke to him, Harvey thinks, was
early on and at least one other time occurred which was whe

whether he mentioned anyone at the White House. Harvey
ee

thinks that if Bissell had said that he had been directly

asked by the President, then Harvey wuld have remembered
it even today. His impression is that the implication in
Bissell's conversation with Harvey was that the White House
had initiated its but he said that he couldn't be sure
whether Bissell had said the White House wanted it set up
to be. ready. in being or whether the White House wanted the
possibility explored. Harvey elaborated that the White Hous
might sa"create such a capability" , or might say "deter-
mine whether it would be a good idea to set up such a
capability" or might say "see if it would be possible to
set up such a capability."

& Harvey is fairly certain that Bissell did not indicate
whether Dulles knew about this White House request, nor coujd
Harvey be sure whether Bissell had indicated whether it was

White House who had made the request. Again, he has the
impression, although he can remember nothing express, that
at the time he received the distinct impression Bissell's
conversation at the White House had only been a short time

prior to his conversation with Harvey. When pressed, he

said he was not. sure and he might even have spoken to Bisse}1l
a short time before the Kennedy inauguration(which would
have meant that Bissell was more likely to have been refeTring
to the Eisenhower White House as having pressured Bissell
to set up an exécutive action capability.) On the other

hand, he has the strong impression that the second time he

sas told by Bissell, i.e., in the fall, Bissell again impli¢d
that the renewed pressures had been recent, thereby strongl
suggesting that, at least at that point, it was the Kennedy
White House which was involved.

; Bissell asked him to explore the current clandestine
services capability to make recommendations on how such an
operation should be set up. He does not recall Bissell men
tioning Castro, Lumumba or Trujillo, although it is possibl

that it was at that time that Bissell told Harvey about his

approach. tofi@mporn tes lj (and as noted above, Harvey definitel
remembers that,at some point Bissell did do that). But
Harvey does not preclude the possibility that there was a

general discussion of the kinds of situations when that

pability might be useful to have, and that this could hav

included discussions of Trujillo, Castro and Lumumba. He FILE:

simply does not remember and does not think they discussed
the project in terms of likely specific targets.
Either at that first meeting with Bissell or shortly

thereafter, Harvey learned that

Gottlieb had been "cut in" by Bissell on Bissell's interest
in executive action capability. Harvey thought this was
unfortunate, but it was done. Harvey also thought Bissell

should have known better than to discuss Lumumba with

i) moral scruples against being involved.

Also, shortly after being asked to set up executive
jaction capability, Harvey learned about the Cuban operation

involving the Office of Security and understood that both

J.C. King and J. Esterline were witting, as well as O'Connej1

and Edwards. Harvey is not) sure why Bissell would have tol

project was really threefold: (1) he was actively running
QJWIN the asset, (2) QJWIN was spotting people whom Harvey
assumes Qe Bvas considering both for normal Division D

and executive

action capability, and (3) 8g did explore the general
concept involved for setting up such capability with Harvey}
We next spoke about the portion of the report suggest-
ing that Harvey had been briefed about the technical de-
velopments. of capabilities under the Roselli plot. Harvey
said that he does not recall the name and is fairly certain

he never met or dealt with ) the person who

actually made the pills in the TSD. He did know both Sid

Gottlieb and "Manny" Gunn fairly well. He said that in
terms of his general professional duties as a Station Chief
and counterespionage expert against the Soviets, he had
made it a point of keeping fairly current in background
knowledge on the enemy's capabilities for assassination.

He had therefore discussed the latest state of the art with
the Office of Medical Services (where Gunn was) and TSD
@where Gottlieb was). He said he had also discussed with
those offices medical and other scientific aspects of
interrogation techniques (e.g. truth serum) and control
techniques (e.g. post-hypnotic suggestion for controlling

agents). He had had general discussions, therefore, with

both Gunn and Gottlieb. However, he does seem to recall
a discussion of specific techniques with Gunn at one point,
although he is not positive this was after he had been

assigned the ZRRIFLE task by Bissell. In any event, he can ote
remember asking Gunn to brief Gottlieb, as is suggested in
the IG Report.

We next discussed the notes in the ZRRIFLE file. (The
xerox of those notes sent us by CIA is in part illegible.
I returned and took down completely that set of notes which
specifically discusses the executive action capability and
which is the set Harvey identified as his. Appended here-
to: : are’ my notes, but_if Harvey is goin x
to be questioned about them we would really have to ask CIA
for the file copy before next Wednesday.)

The reference to Notes hereafter refers to a package

of three sets of notes which we had xeroxed by the Agency.
The first two or three pages which are not in Harvey's
handwriting appear to be a draft of what would be the basic
project outline used as a cover for the ZRRIFLE project.

It does discuss QJWIN as the asset and does indicate that

he will be used to spot other criminals for sensitive pro-
jects. But unlike the subsequent notes, it does not discus
issues regarding the setting up of an assassination capa-
bility. The next set | of notes which are in large writing
on pages covered with various doodles are those identified vy
Harvey es his. From looking at them, he judged that they wer

otes based on two successive conversations. First, with

dney Gottlieb on the 25th of January, 1961 and then on

the 26th of January with Harvey concluded

that the first conversation with Gottlieb ranged across a

variety of activities which fell within the framework of

BILE:

Gottlieb's position at TSD. (Harvey speculated Gottlieb
had just become Acting Director or taken over some other
high post in TSD.) His conclusion in this regard is based
in part on references in that first section of his notes
to items which he recalls and which hewuld swear have

nothing to do with ZRRIFLE. For example, there is a dis-

regarded as the best man

Gottlicb used for whatever mechanism was eventually chosen.

He could not understand the reference to the narcotics BILE

bureau, except that if Gottlieb or he at that point knew
about QJWIN they might have been aware of his initial in-
volvement with American intelligence agencies in a narcotic
enforcement operation. The reference to "RIS 201 cover
caution" meant that if there was an attempt to get a fake
201 file as cover involving the person allegedly in some
operation relevant to the Russian intelligence service, thi
had to be done with great caution. Harvey speculated that

the word ."bankruptcy" referred to the same considerations

discussed below -- that there was a bankruptcy of policy on
the part of the CIA or USA if there had to be a resort to

assassination. (This might frame an interesting general

_policy question for Harvey.)

Harvey did not know what "no star" meant. I asked him
if that might refer to the star file system, and he said thdt
when he was in the Agency he didn't know about one or does |
not recall one now. He thinks the reference to "eyes . .
Jim A. -- contradistinct from U-2" may have meant that the
check of any assets to be used through the CI Division, a

normal operating technique, in this case should be done on

an "eyes only" basis through Angleton. He also thought the
reference to the U-2 might mean that unlike that operation,
this project should not be run on such a compartmented basis,

that any assets to be used were not checked with CI(so that

he counterespionage protective resources of the Agency

were utilized.) Harvey thinks that the phrase "not a TSD
