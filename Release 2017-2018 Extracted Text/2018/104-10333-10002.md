Types of Questions for DA Records Briefing
March 17, 1997

Budget and Finance

1. In Cold Warrior, (p. 52) Mangold refers to a CI secret slush fund which was tightly
controlled by Angleton and never audited by the usual procedures. According to
Mangold, it was this fund which allowed Angleton to run his own operations without
supervision. Did the fund exist? Was this fund ever audited? Are there any records of
Cl operational expenses for the period 1959-63?

2. Mangold also refers (p. 53) to an unnamed CI/B&F officer who says he worked for
Angleton from 1958-1964 and never dealt with him directly on a single matter. Is there
a list of B&F officers assigned to the CI Staff from 1959-63. Do their records still exist?

3. We have seen Directorate of Operations monthly operational reports which contain
information on the allocation/ distribution of operational funds. Are there other DO or
DA records which reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this type of
information from the early 1960's still be retrieved?

4. What records are kept on disbursements to sources in the field? If, hypothetically,
LHO had received money from the Agency, what records would exist? ~

1. What records are maintained on contract personnel? > 'p a dake

1. For the period betweén 1955-65, what was the universe of files that OS had on
individuals oRgroups?

2. How are Office of Security records indexed? car du leu pune Ww : S

3. What was the function of the Office of Security / pecurity Research Staff (OWS SRS)? ~

Why were defector records kept in this component? &= ....\c A Gann eee aie

4. In the-OS/SRS memo of Oct. 31, 1960, written by Marguerite D. Stevens, the file
numbers of several defectors are listed: “Robert Edward Webster, EE-18854; Lee
Harvey Oswald, MS-11163; Libero Ricciardelli, MS-8295; Vladimir Sloboda, MS-10565;
and Joseph Dutkanicz, MS-10724.” What do the “Ms” and “EE” file prefixed designate?
How are these designations assigned?


13-00000

: 5: Does OS process security clearances for non-employees (ex g- sources) to receive

’> access to classified information? What kinds of files-are created by this process? How
long are these files maintained. For example, Clay Shaw was given a security clearance
and had access to classified information based on his “responsibilities” as a source for
the Domestic Contacts Division (DCD).

6. Where are records that would describe liaison (etc.) cooperation or operations
between OS and CI located? How are these records organized?

7. Where are records regarding operations that OS participated in or ran located. For
example, where are the OS records on the Castro assassination attempts?

8. How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which OS components maintained files on
Oswald? Why did OS have any files on Oswald?
