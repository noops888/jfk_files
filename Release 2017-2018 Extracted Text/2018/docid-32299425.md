with. various Cuban exile groups, believes JURE and the l p
anti-CASTRO organization Second National Front of the iS
Escambray (SNFE), may have shown sign of partial unity pe
and both these groups are generally regarded as polit-
ically left and not pro-U.S. MANUEL VARELA CASTRO re-
signed ‘as military chief of JURE in 2/65 because of
repeated postponements of infiltration of Cuba by
MANUEL RAY. VARELA holds the opinion that RAY lacks
the ability to direct a movement against the CASTRO
regime. VARELA advised that recently RAY has suggested
plans for JURE to engage in an air raid against Haiti
from Venezuela, using Puerto Rico as an intermediate
base; RAY has also indicated plans to assist Haitian
revolutionaries to overthrow the government of FRANCOIS
DUVALIER in order to obtain a base in Haiti for anti-
CASTRO operations. VARELA Stated such tactics would
be a complete departure from JURE's long standing
strategy of the need for an internal uprising in Cuba,
and the, decrying of hit and run attacks fostered by
other anti-CASTRO groups. VARELA stated JURE funds have
been received from anonymous source, believed in the
U.S. government, but this subsidy was discontinued as

MM 105-6661

DETAILS : On September 28, 1969, MM T-1, a Cuban
exile leader at "Miem!, who had, during

: the summer of 1964, associated “nia
organization with JURE, stated that as of September 28,
1964, the reputation of JORE among Cuban exiles -hed-
seriously deteriorated, and JURE leader MANUEL RAY re-
mained a prisoner of his much publicized promise to be in
Cuba by May, 1964.

MM Tel g@dvised that there had been considerable
financial mismanagement within JURE, wherein money was
wasted on firearms that were defective and which could
have been purchased on the open market at a better price
than was obtained by JURE from the ERQUIAGA Arms Company
of Los Angeles, California.

MM Tel stated that efforts by MANUEL RAY to make |

an infiltration of Cuba during May, and again on two
occasions during July, 1964, had failed, with the result
that what contacts he had in Cuba were no longer inva

‘position to:.assist RAY because of the jeopardy involved.

According to MM T-1, MANUEL RAY was excessivee
ly concerned with maintaining relationships with JUAN
BOSCH, the deposed President of the Demlnican Republic;
Governor LUIS MUNOZ MARIN of Puerto Rico, and "PEPE"
FIGUERAS, former Costa Rican President; with the result
that JURE! scability to ebtain assistance from the Dominican
Republic and a base in that country were hampered.

MM T-1 stated that the. principal defect in the
leadership of MANUEL RAY is the fact that he is extreme-
ly ambitious and conceited, and seeschimself as the next
