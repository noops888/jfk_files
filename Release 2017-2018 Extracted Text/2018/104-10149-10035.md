In his letter to the HSCA and in his oral testimony, Bagley
mentioned CIA's possession of ‘a Secret KGB document concerning
disinformation. This document was received many years ago from
an East Buropean intelligence officer defector. Therefore, we
cannot make a strong case for deleting reference to it, although
we wish that Bagley had not mentioned it.

I understand from your conversation with Rodger that you would
welcome a letter from the Agency, on this section of the report,
for inclusion with it in the final report. Could we have more
details? i

Very truly. yours,

Dear Bob:
Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains
under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,
which he has not moved to have modified. ‘To expose his true
status as a former CIA employee could have repercussions in his
present situation that we must accept as significant. When he
was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary
to remove his cover, in the event he decided to go overt in this
matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains

‘ classified. We therefore request that the example set in the
Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy
Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft.

Following are detailed comments:

NOSENKO
Testimony of Nosenko
Page 1, lines 15 and 18. KGB agents should read KGB officers.

There were factors, however, that ‘imited, ie valué

of the information supplied to the Committee. by: these:

same KGB Directorate as Nosenko, and’ 2) one of them had”
