SUBJECT: Deoting with Kaquel RAY, 15 Hovenber 1960, at a Kotel
Reproduce

in Homesteed, Florida

1. Fhe wasting wee beld tn the above-pamed place because, ot that
particular tise, Kanwel Ray vas still “ander wraps" and ve 01d not vant
to take any chsnces of having him spotted in Minut. Manvel Rey and bis
wife bad been ériven fron Tarpa by “Ray Adana" (Ray Dubois) to the above-
maned motels I bad previously called Rey on the telephone from Eew York
at bie Temps residence and told him that I vould meet him on 15 Bovesber.
‘The meeting began at 2100 hours and lasted until about 0130 the next day.

2. The highlights of this meeting vere reported in MASH~l694, 17
Hovenber, copy of which fa attached. The following paragragha are tn
elatoration of this massage.

3. puring this first meeting, ay intent vas to eotabifeh rapport, 4
probe into Ray's political thirking, and, by reiterating previcosly ste
statements on the Bender group's willingness to 6: ‘the MEP, to
establish the Benger group as a private contacto dafinitive for anti-
Castro activities, In line vith this, I kept the mecting purposely .
ee en “exchange of views" seeaion, avoiding any controversy, but at i: ah
the cass tine, indicating some surprise and som bevildersent over scar
of Roy's statements.

&, Throughout the conversation, ay clearly stresses his great
belief in civil liberties, individual freedow, and bie position ss a
Cuban, and also hemispheric, nationalist. On a number of occasicas, be
stressed the point that soot likely sose of the solutions he proposed
for the post-Castro period, wight. de viewed by mo vith acne. alegivings.
Don't you believe, be asked, that vhat ie important to the t
U. 8. fe not necessarily teportant to the ecanony of Cubat - Don you
think that the Anericen trend of ¢emocracy, vhich works odmirably.in ~ . ve
your country, ts not necessarily appliceble in ite t ity in Cuber :

$. May reiterated, on a number of cecesions, that be vanted to go
deck to 2 Jancary 1959. Be vas quite firm =-.es reported. ii the: abover
pontioned eable = on the need of the nationslisating of public utilities;

when eoked about the agrarian reform and, in this’ ecutigetion, whet would o Toe a

Beppen to Castro-seized Anaricen rencbes, be sald that lend distribution re :
and ownerehip by individual firms of land eo parcelled out, vould be o
goal of his governsents the criteria on whether or not American-owed
Fanches would be returasd to their owners, were currently being vorkes



ae

out by Pelipe Pasco.’ (COMENT: I gained the impression thet these
Fenchea might not be returned.)

6. I renlly shoved some surprise when Rey said that he vould not
wake the 1940 Constitution the basis for his future government. ‘This issue
came up in the folloving manner: J aske) Ray vbether or not be could vork e+
either by Joining er by affiliating -- with the FRD, and when bis ansver -
was in the negative, I posed the question of vhat were the areas of agrees - a
went and of disagreement between hie and the FHD. Ray said that he had
mot ao yet talked tu Tony Varona but thet he would feel that there could
be agreenent on a number of points: first, to get rid of Castro; second,
that there skould be civil libertiee and indivicual freedom. He said
that perhaps the area of disagreement was considerably greater: be
could not accept the 1940 Constitution as the basis for Cuba's political
life in the future. Odvisusly, som provisions of the Constitution vould
ba retained but especially provisions for electoral procedures would have
to be changed radically! the current provisions
ané feather-bedding, and are not responsive to t!
Questions of nationalization and other econoaic matters would have to
dealt with more thoroughly in the Constitution. Another point en Oise,
agreement with the FAD is the fact that it was Linked too =
pest. The FRD, Ray sais, ie really T-ny Verona, Of the five,’
only one of any true importance amongst the current Executive: C
woubere Corrillo has alvays been very close to the MRP political festive,

Hovever, Verona i inseparably linked vith the corruptness Of the Prio: ” :
Fegine although be, Verona, is undoubtedly a completely honest man. “In

outdated political and cconomie philosophy of the Prio regime... It is

Ditterly about our handling of the Sisesio Waleh affairs Binecio Valsh ves
Looking for area. Ke, Ray, vas eager to build up hie organization and
therefore to drav people Like Walsh into bie circle. One of the means to

60 thie was, of course, to mike valoh dependent on bis, Rayts, ability to
furnish militery equipment. Walsh nade a request for arms to Rays Ray
channeled this request: to his Anerican contects im Havena in the anticipation
-that he, Ray, would be given the credit by Weleh of having delivered the goods.
Woet happened, hovever, vas that Plinio Prieto, who had been trained in
America, msde contact vith kuleh and essured him thet support would be
fortheoutng from s source other than Ray, Thi, Ray continued, was, in~
dication that the Asericans vented to split avay the Waleh-group- from adie

Ray's influence. T indicated no mnovledge sbout this affair but poorposes

the conclusion érevn froa it by Ray. a

8. after thie political Uiscussion, Rey elucidated on peychological
aspeots of the MRP work: we ere revolutionaries, ond thus ve.

‘Thus, for
inotance, we can not be netisfied just to uccept moneys we must engage in

9. Adove concluded the over-all ¢iscussion and some detailed questions
were asked by Rey. Could be bave $25,000 by next voek? q. eommitted
