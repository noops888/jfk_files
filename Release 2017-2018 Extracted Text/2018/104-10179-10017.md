2. The highlighta of this meeting vere reported In HASH-169%, 17

Reveaber, copy of which to attached. the following paragraphs ure in

@Laboration of this massage.

During thie first meeting, my intent was to eatablic rapport,

probe into Ray'o politicel thicking, and, by reiterating previously ande

statements on the Header Goop'e Willingess to support the MaP, to

establlah the Bender groap as a private contacto dafinitivo for anti-

Castro activitles. In Iine with this, I lopt the meeting purposely

an en "exchange of views" sesason, aralding any controveroy, but at

the nams tine, Indicating sone surprise and aoue bendlderment over some

of Ray's statements.

4.

Throsghout the carversation, fay clearly stressed his great

ballet 1o elvil Liberties, Individual freedon, and bia poeltion 1e «

Caban, and also bentepberie, nationaliet. On a number of occasicas, be

«trensed the point that nost likely sone of the solutions be propored

for the poot caetro period, night. be viend by me with sone steelring.

Don't you ballere, be asted, that rant le important to the rectory of the

W. B. 10 not necessarily Important to the deonony of Cubal Don't you

think that the American brand of demerney, which turke addrably in

your country, la not secesearily applienble in 1t0 totality in Ciba!

May refterated, on a number of cecasione, that he vented to go

back to 1. Janaary 1959.

I anined the Inpression that these

ranches might not be returned.

6. I renlly shoved some surprice when Ray sald that be rould not

esther by joining or by affillating - with the PRD, and when blo anaver

man In the negativo, I posed the question of what vere the arene of tires.

ment and of dinsgreement betwen him and the Y'KD. Ray anld that be bad

not as yet talked tu fouy Varon but that he would feal that there eould

be agreedent on a number of pointes firat, to get rid of Castroy second,

that there siould be civil liberties and individual freedon. Is said

that perbaps the ares of disagreement was conniderably greaters be

could not accept the 1940 Conatitution as the basis for Cuba's polltical

Life In the future.

Obvionaly, sone proviatons of the Conatitution would

be retained but espeolally provisiona for electoral procedures woald have

to be changed radieally! the current provioiona are fostering corruption

and feather-beddine, and are not responsive to the will of the people.

Questions of nutionalltution and other economie battera rould have to be

dealt with more thoroughly in the Constitution,

Another point of dis.'C

apreement with the PRD le the tact that 1t ma Linked too much with the

past.

Impossible for the MP to bare any dealings with or any liato: to that

past.

7. I saked Ray what his position to the Borlet/Chican Dloek would

be after Castro's denise.

One of our baale concepte, Ray salarie to."
