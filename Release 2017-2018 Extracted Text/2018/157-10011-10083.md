Most of my operations were run out of Europe.

Q Run out of --

A Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones
were run out of Europe.

Q Well, in the course of your activities with respect
to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the
operations of the Miami base?

A Yes.

Q And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

A Yes, sir.

Q During the nine years you were with DDO's Cuban
operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami
Station? |

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know
it. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was y

Q What years was he Chief?

A I think |was there about a year and a half. He
left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973. '

Special Activities Staff. It was headed hy Desmond Fitzgerald.
And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations
Group.

Q Now, was this a special group within the NDO or was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

that ~- when Harvey left,

G62) ritzserata took over, it became Special Activities Staff.

It wasn't attached to anything except -- it reported to the
Deputy Director, Plans.

Q And that was Mr. Karamessines?

A Yes. Well, it was Helms at that time back when it
was first created. Helms was DDP at that time.

Q And Task Force W was created immediately after the
Bay of Pigs?

A Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --
in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

Q And that subsequently became the Special Activities
Staff?
A Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went
back into the Western Hemisphere Division.

Q And what was the date of that reorganization?

Q Do you know whether or not they consider him an
established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to
collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A I can't speak to that but the records that we have
don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact
somebody in that context, Knowing that there is a 201 file
on Sturgis, they- would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hold

the file.
Q Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?
A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
Q Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

A Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know
each other. They have to know each other from their days
in Cuba.

Q Do you know whether or not Mr. Sturgis ever partici-
pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

A No. As I recall, we employed Martinez around 1961,

Q And that would include both the publications and tie
radio?

A Right.

Q Let's talk about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of it
economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

A Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the
regime, his credit worthiness, and this type of thing. We
worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in
the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, 1
guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from
about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel keot

saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out wny he had such a poor crop beciuse

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutt

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a cay,

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schocls, any
place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he
could,

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers tn

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took a

real tumble and ail of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

|
i
i
trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any }

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't!

want him to get the exchange. So it was those types of

activities. .
Q Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen co) deat ae i

' companies enlisted in that effort?

The agriculture sector of the economy was in absolutely total t

anything, and the poor people in Cuba were literally starving.!

There just wasn't anything to eat. And Fidel was going around
with this big plan -- of course, there were a number of
experimental cattle ranches in Cuba. King Ranch had one there.
I forget -- several other European and American companies that
had experimental cattle ranches there and they were experiment-

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages and she was !
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillan-
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved
in.

Q Were there many activities of that type?
A. Not really. You have got to remember that the

Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of

hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty neaa-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously fron --

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts

which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were report

to.Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

in CI activity.

Q Would it be fair to say that the involvement in C!

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-

# whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability

(Arey 202) 5441-6000

to properly staff the thing?

A Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot ;
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
4 of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.

up the wall and, of course, I guess it was around -- the
Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guess

about 1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they

Started to tighten up.

I am sure thef were in part responsible for proposing

alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies when,

there was going to be a raid against Cuba hy one of these

militant groups. A number of times raids were aborted, picked
up by the Coast Guard or Florida Coastal Patrol or the Bureau,

A It began -- well, it beaan around June of '63,

Q Now, with particular reference to the last half of Hl

1963, including whatever period in June '63 may not have been
involved, were there a qreat manv Cubans in the southern United
States who were active in revolutionary fronts that were beina

sponsored by the Agency?

A Wellm you mean Aqencv sponsored fronts?

oy Yes. Z :
i

A The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effort to

have unity rather than these split factions, split anti-castr>

factions. Obviouslv the leaders of the fronts knew that the

CIA was subsidizing. Supposedly the people that joined these
fronts did not know they were being subsidized by the Aqenc:

or the U.S, Government.

a But when vou say “supposedly,” does the fact anneor
to be otherwise?

A WE11, based on mv experience with the Cubans and this
type of thing, and their penchant to talk, I would think that
it wouldh't take long for knowledge of any subsidy to surface
itself.

0. Was it your opinion and impression at that time, ‘tr.

Sturbitts, that a great many Cubans considered themselves to be

involved in the CIA orqanizations?

Cuban exile community was discussing.

A Well, it seems to me he was here at Headquarters in

A Well, the membership varied. As I said, we were

principally interested in the leadership of the organizations. '

Once the organization was established and =he leadership took

getting membership from the Cuban exile community to join.

Q What were their functions, the fronts?

political organization in exile.

and solely involved in the intelligence in the Caribbean.

Q Does

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban
situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

A No. Well, let me explain that to you. We do have

a career agent who has been with us for a good many years

in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.
who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done principally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths, this
type of thing. He does contact these people all over the
United States. If we come across an individual that looks like
he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double hin,
we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we i
find out where relatives and these types of people are, we
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
these people, be it.New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever.

Q So you use Cuban, now citizens or. aliens in this

country, aS access agents.
