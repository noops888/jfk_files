_ 9tCRET,

17 July 1970

MEYORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 1 Baysond H. GERENDE (P) and Wife.

1. Raymond H, GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and con-
tract agent “ho has been employed by the Agency in Mexico
City eince 18 March 1955 under an MOC, during which tine
be has served this Agency well, During the past fifteen
years GERENDE has been generally engaged in the. area of

“operational support activities in Mexico City. For:the

past two years he served as a principal agent handler

for a sensitive fixed surveillance project, LIEMPTY; was
used in unilateral recruitment approaches agsinst the
Cubar target; and in special aupport investigations.

Mire. GERENDE, who is LIEMPYY/19, has been employed off

and on since 1958 as 8 support asset, (transcriber/trans=
lator) under HOC, and during the past two yoars has worked
intermittently transcribing unilateral telephone tap tapes.

2. During the past year GERENDE and his wife have
had serious marital problems which culminated in a sepa~

gration in November 1969, and divorce actions sere initiated
by both parties. The divorce proceedings are still in

the courts, and bitter disputes have resulted between both
parties concerning custody of the children, division of
personal property, and the monetary settlements... The above
problem is compounded by the fact that GERENDS's wife knows
in some considerable detail.of GERENDE's activities on
behalf of tho A,ency and if she exposed him, it-could lead
to the surfacing of GERENDE's Asency employment and pos-
gible compromise of operations LIEKPTY, LIMESA, LIEMBRACE,
and LIFRAT, as well as numerous individual Station assets
such as LISTERINE, LIBAZOR/1, LIBAND/1, and David MH.
WILSTED (FP). Since late 1959 Station bas
been in touch with both GERENDE and e on this prob=
lem, and every effort has beon made by the Station to have



~ procedure;

: ~ SECRET. a
-2-

both parties settle the divorce amicably and to protect
GERENDE's cover and that of the projects. Because of the
above family problems which threatened GERENDE's personal
cover and security, he was relieved of all operational
responsibilities and placed on half galary in December 1969.

3. In March of 1970, Station decided
that GERENDE's personal pronleis were not being resolved,
and because of the continuing security threat, Plans were
made to terminate both GERENDE and his wife by the end of
FY 1970, The LIEMPTY Project Yrenegal, approved in May
1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for
GERENDE of $10,000 for 15 years of service with the agency,
and in addition approval was received to pay Mrs, GERENDE
the sum of $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep
her from revealing Ler husband's ‘wency affiliation and
what she knows about Agency operations in Mexico. This
project approval carried the ADDF xaveat that the ter-
mination bonuses to both GERENDE and hig wife be paid on

“@ monthly basis rather than in one lump. sum. as.a_security

measure to assure at. least an element of control over
both individuals, since the continued receipt of these
monthly payments depended on their loyalty to the Agency.
GERENDE fe were terminated by Station represen-
tatives no 26 June 1970 under etindard Avency
and separate Quit Claims and Secrecy Agros-
monte were giyaed by both GERENDE acd. bis wife. Neither
GERENDE ior his wife had any objection to the wording of
the Quit Claims or the Security agreements, and both
appeared to be satisfied with the terms of the settlement,
and with the fairness of the Agency's position.

4. On 8 July 1970 at 1115 hours, Mra, GERENDE appeared

‘at’ the main gata of tho Headquarter's building, and rosuceted

to see an official from tne Cfiu.  Secarity. During the
jubsequent interview, Mra. GERENDE established her identity,
and supplied the interviewer witn details on her and her
husband's past employment with the Agency ‘in Mexico City
and the fact that they bad terminated said employment in
late June 1970. Mrs. GERENDE made three specific requests
of the Agency:



icici -. SECRET

-~3-

i “A. That she be released from the stipulation in
her secrecy agreement whica prohibits her from revealing
her or ber husband's affiliation with tie Agency, in
order that eho may substantiate her husbanc'’s salary to
be awarded support payment from her husband,

"B, If her first request cannot be fullfilled, ‘i
that she be awarded a higher amount of support from the..NCE,
Agency.

If neither of the above two can be fullfilled,
jount }
either at the address mentioned above or in care of the

that she be sent the Agency check (in present

In addition to the above, Mrs. GERENDE stated she feels
she must permanently leave Mexico City because of threats |
made on her hife by her. husband; and that she cannot weet H
her AvencyEcontact in Mexico City as specified in hor

: termination, to receive the monthly payments from him.

: Mrs. GXRENDE has been given the phone number of the «gency
Tecur® Uuty Officer and her local phone number and
address, where she is temporarily residing, was obtained.
She was advised she would be contacted within the near
future with a0 answer to her requests.

2 Station was notified by cable of the situation and: their
comments were requosted.. The Station, on 10 July, recoa-
mended that Headquarters hold Mrs, GERENUE to. her secrecy
agreement, not grant her any increase beyond the amount
: agreed upon in her termination, and proposed that she be

are forwarding under separate cover copics of several ucmoranda
Prepared by GERENDZ, Ono outlines the history of his marital
problems, another describes the current legal situation, and a
third outlines proposals for a settlement, Tiere is no hope of
reconciliation, The Station's position with GLENDE from the
start has been that he must agree to an anicable ecttlement with
his wife in order to insure that she would not feel forced to take
steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations,
For this reason, the Station insisted fron the beginning that any
financial settlemont with his wiie would have to tuke into account
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary frow RVROCK, and
that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could eake no legal claim to that :
salary. GERENDE's wire was made avare of our position on this, and
she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement
was Strictly taformal, The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
allowed to uso his KVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his
ife, because if he did, she “could hardly be expected to refrain
rom exposing his connections, Indeed, events have shown that
‘SGERENDE's. wife is a vindictive wozan, and if it had not been clear
‘to her that she, as well as GENEIDZ, would lose money if he loses
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDZ, for
his par., would have preferred to keep his RYROCK salary entirely
out of the picture. Eventually, hovever, he agreed that the Station
position was fair, and he said he would conforn,

"4. The attached: memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's
Opinion, basically fair accounts. In the beginning, the Station
was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of the
doubt,zlargely because her description of GSRENDE's character
Weaknesses cameas no surprise (particularly his tendency to
rocrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake). Early in the
gconflict, LIEMPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
she could tell her lawyer about Gi2EDE's salary, She was told
she could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,
and. that if she told anyone that GZRENDE bad any connection with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied. and GERHNDE would. be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it
meant she would-have to scale her support deziands down to the
level of GERENDE's overt income (GZR&DE's nonthly salary fron
RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he e2rned an additional 4.to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he haS since rented their house, for which
he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly).
Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station. would see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to. receive an RVROCK salary, he,
would give her the same proportica of this. salary that the courts
.Ildetermined should be paid from.his overt incone. This, of course,
was strictly an informal arrangezent, one which would stop_t. sieanat
Winute GERENDE stopped receiving a salary. Latér, as Lis®Ty-
‘position hardened and her vindictiveness bégan to rule her actions,
LIEMPTY~19 was. reminded ‘by the Station that the longer it took for
an amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance
that GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in. having hin
arrested (which She succeeded in. doing twice), his job would be ‘
jeopardized. While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had ‘no
intention of causing his termination, and had never breathed a
word to a soul about his RVROCK iation, her attitude was in
fact jeopardizing his job and if -he lost his job, she and. the
children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income, . Her attitude is

eoubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she became more and

has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and
prior to the current peroonal crisis he had been told that he

would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order

to retain his position. As Headquarters is aware, he hed been

given Additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well, There has never been any question of GiRINDE'’s
i ability, As we have previously stated, he is personable, intelligent,
j bilingual and binational, and has had Rood training and experience

| in certain fields, On the. other hand, there has long been doubt

memos, Which took place when he was confined to his hore as an
xLP keeper, did more than cause domestic probleas -= it apparently
deprived him of the discipline of a daily job. His well-deserved
reputation for being lazy was earned years ago.

6, The question which must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE, We can be useful to the Station, but
the station has learned to get along without him, What are the
security hazards involved? The general range of his knovledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference, If all of this vere blown,
the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations
againststhe MHHARSH target, would be considerable, The Station
does ‘not belicve that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
but it is impossible to predict what LIFMPTY-19 might do, particularly
“since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, havirg already
.Llost a possible source of income through the termination, G#RENDE's
termination bonus would probably be ‘in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars. Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
two of them has never been mentioned. i

(for the same reason); and 201-838166 (to find out if he did,

in fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were,
a requirement which was quickly satisfied), Also, LICALLA has been
asked to report on the arrival and activitics of TD¥ers such as

the ANKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that
“security inspectors" are expected -- he is told of the expected

be. requested ag necessary, and. the LILYRIC: personnel responded to
the Station request for. such extra.coverage during the AZMIDRIFF ,
and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports
during the reporting period.on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Enbassy, Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings.of MHHARSH officials,
up-to-date recording of MHHARSH license numbers, special activities
and visitors (particularly Americans, of whom five were spotted and
reported on during the reporting. period), and.sone 3,500 photographs,
As an example of the value of LILYRIC-coverage, within one week of
the change of license plates at the MHHARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting al with new numbers bearing no relation to

other things, this enabled the Station to identify AESEASICK's

FUTURE PIANS |,

11. As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion

jthat he must be terminated,

This is not an easy decision to nake,

bor will it be. easy to confront GzRENDE with this decision, He

has, after al

devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK,

Hovever,

as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able

to getehlong without his services,
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.

Furthernore, the constant

To try to molify her by promising her a portion of his salary is
“probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her

attitude has progressively hardened,
intends tp terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970.

The Station, therefore,
GERENDE's:

contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per

full year, This would come to $8,750 (USD).

For various reasons,

including the need to preserve the security of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is anicable, it will probably be
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD). Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY=19 of
the termination, and, to keep her from revealing what she knows,

she will undoubtedly have to be given some aoney herself,

The

Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound fron

@ security point of view to use the money which GFRENDE himself has

earned for this purpose, Therefore, while the figure will remain

negotiable, the Station believes
would be a reasonable anount,

that the sum of $2,500 (USD)
Total obligations for FY 1970 in:

the LIE:PTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than
$33,000 (USP). The Project has been approved in the amount of
$38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It.
is therefore requested that the LIZMPTY Project be amended for
FY.1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.

SUBJECT; GERENDE Backgrovad and Status Report
of Present Marital Cenflict

1, While this is not intended to-be a full exposition of my
personal and private life over recent years,’ I would Like to make
_ known some of the factors that have, from my point of view, led
uP to the present situation,

vi’ @, Y realize that the interests of the organization and the
interest of the individuals who may have opportunity to come in
contact with my case dictate as little Personal involvement as
possible 4n the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of
security, compartnentation and efficiency prescribe the medue
operandi and, to a great extent the :sodus vivendi, of agency
personae] net only in the sense of earning a living but also in
manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
i life, the better, but, as the years ge by, changes may occur which
j | 60 unreported or unnoticed and which may bring about unexpected
i; events and revercussions. ‘When f person has beeu working for the
j. Station, as I have, for fifteen years with little or no personnel
; handling provleas, no security flups, no obvious problems on the
job,,.and something cones up like the abrupt separation of- my
wife (LUUMPTY-19) and re with the nersoual and potential security
risks it has entailed, I feel that some explanation is necessary.

and 5 percent per ycar), She then Sought Jegal advice firoa an old
friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margadant who, in turn, steered
her to a young wozan lawyer, Dra, Berta Martinez, who must have
advised LIEMPTY-19 that under the local legal system the only way

to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable Support was to
hang on to the children becarse LIEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face"
in her attitude concerning them and she now said that she could not

Baying J.was not interested in getting divorced, whereas she said
that her ‘ind was made up and that we would have to split up.

. 11, Things cazie to a head on the night of 12 November when I
got hone arvund 9 PN and she sugested we have a rink and talk
things over, I mixed tome martinis and she began laying down the
terms under which she thought te should get divorced, i.e. I sould
move out of the housc, mortgage to pay back her father's noncy,
Grant her custody of the childrea aad support of 2,000 pesos per
month per child ($8,000). 1 said I would not get divorced under
those conditions and we discussed and argued in the kitchen for about
threc hours, killing a bottle of gin in the process, We went
upStairs and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rou
children, unsuccessiully, and then tried to leave the house
I would not Ict her do, She got hystcrical, phoned a neighbo:
Uta de la Hoz, then she vent into the front yard and awakened the
next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, andasked to go to
their house.. A few minutes Jater, Uta and her husband Guillerao

About a halfi-hcur later I walked up to Uta's to ask LIEMPTY-19
to.come” home but was told that she was busy phoning her lawyer

and would not veturn,

12,..The following morning I took the children to school as
usual and my sister Marcin (LIE@TY-4's wife) picked them up ard
took them to her house where I joined them for lunch, LiiPTy-19

the children saying she was taking them home, failed to co so, then

TO : Case Officer
-FROM =: GERENDE
‘SUBJECT: GERENDE Status Report

‘The presont situation of the marital conflict between GERENDE and
his wife (LIEVPTY-19) is as follows: -

HH 1, GERENDE is living at his mother's apartment at 99 Carlos
‘B. Zetina Street, Apartment 9, He has rented a three-bedroon
‘Bpartment at Tornel 3 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where
:he.has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his
; former: address at Ladera 39, Lomas de Bezaros,

af 2, The house.at Ladera 39 is rented to an-executive of
/ Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife,

jand fifteen-year old daughter, all ‘of Argentine nationality. The

monthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,
beginning 1. February 1970,

H

val 3. LIEMPTY~19'and the four children are apparently. still

hyiving at the rosidence of the Netherlands Ambassador, Baron
Schelto Van “Heemstra at Pefia 360, Jardines del Pedregal. It seems

; fairly certain they are. at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana and Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last
| two occasions he has seen then, They have been there since

{5 December 1969, LIEWPTY-19 has denied that she has a-fixed address

band says that she is staying with "friends,"

! 4. LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to-use the services of|
jas her lawyer and, through him, is pressing for even more
Padvantageous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November.

iPlease see the attached copy and translation of the latest proposal
imade by/ on 4 March 1970, .

5. The charges and accusations: made by LIEMPTY-19 against
GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:

a. Insults, threats and attempted homicide -- this charge ~
rests at the 5° Juzgado Penal, 2° Corte Penal located at



Lecumberri, The judge 43 cP7a Mollade, Tiese eNtefes Lave
not been pressed since they were originally made on 13 Novenber
1969 by LINMPTY-19, The ruling on these charges, should the
case come to trial, nust bo made by three judges of the 2° Corte
Penal composed of the 4th, Sth, and 6th Juzgados Penales, . The
i Judge of the 6° Juzgade is Lic. QUIPAZCO, an aluanus of
GERENDE's lawyer, Jorze Mario MAGALLON, ‘Torether they have,
on two occasions, been to speak to Judge CRUZ Mellado vho
agreed not t issue an arrest warrant and who has, finally,
called for a hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at
i 10:00, MAGALLON has given GERENDE assurances that the charges
: are likely to be dismissed,

b, Fraud -~- this charge was made by LIEWPTY~19 and her

i lawyer on 11 December 1969, tho day aftexy GERRIDE left the

} Villa Obregon jail aftor having. spent a week there for

i disobeying a court order, (The court order had consisted of

j an unfounded ‘request to have GERINDE expelled from his house

\ and, to have LIEMPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as

: the temporary custodian of the children, GERENDE refused then
i admissbn under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
| Judge's. order, so.the judge's secrctary. arbitrarily. ordered,
i

[

Onythe spot, a 10-day detention, Subsequently, the hidge,
LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
ag incompetont, The judge has had to face charzes of

oi Be collusion from and with the lawyers of both Partios, i.e,

; Magallon and Jurado, The charge of. fraud rests at slesa 31%

i of the Procuraduria del Distrito. Federal, The Public Ministry

| Agent. in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
¢ ! LIEMPTY-~19. claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for
i { building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy

the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under
tho separate property marriage clause Ind wrongfully placed
tho property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.
Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christnas 1965
in’a complicated transaction involving three other partners;
H Robert Bancroft WHITZHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and- Janes
: Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property
| in their respective names with the complete. knowledge of their
| ‘ Spouses. Later the land was. subdivided and after nineteen i
{ months the decds were issued. LIE!PTY-19 supervised and prodded
i the notary who made the transaction and. she was perfectly aware
4 that the property was in GERENDE's name. -In August 1967 when
! construction of the. house began, LIE:PTY~19's father's money
| Was used which. he had deposited in “exico for the purpose,
| Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan
agreement, GERENDE has beea paying it off and has receipts from
LIEMPTY-19 to show for it, ql

No further action bas been taken by LUscTY-19 or her lasyer
on this matter but tie charge has not finally been settled and

is still pending, Tre charge is, of course, unfounded ard is
awaiting the proper “lubricztion" in order to be filed azay,

. ce. Neglect -- this charge vas made by LIE PTY-19 in
Decenber 1969 at the 7° Jr gedo Mixto de Paz claining that
GEREXDE had abandoned LIEMPTY-19 And the children to their fate
and that they were utterly destitute, GERINWE was not
notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a
bearing at the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on
the sidewalk, Judicial Police agents cetained GENENDE, took
hin to the Procuraduria and frea there to Lecumberri, This
process involved being finger-printed and mugged. The
following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three
days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woman)
formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidonce. GERENDE and
Magallon went back on 5 tarch to pick up'the bond money and
see if had appealed but he had not and, apparently,
that matter is closed, : :

6. On 14 Novenbor 1969, one day after LIEMPTY-19 disappeared
trom, hone. taking the children with her, GERENDE brought charges Ee
“against ber for minor lesions and showed medical prooz thereof,

Tho hearing of 9 February after which GERIZIDE was detained, was
called by Villa Cbregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA, GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LIEMPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,.
ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does
not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in
Once a week,

7. LIEMPTY~19 is at Present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri Street in San Angel Inn, The two older ebildren
are going to school there, During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
School. On three occasions GERENDE has been to the schocl at 13:30
to try to'speak to LIEMPTY-19 and see the children. LIEMPTY-19
bas objected to this and the meetings lave been short and fruitless
except for GERENDE learning that they are still Staying at the Dutch
Ambassador's, GERENDE's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).

OR/Progvess Report for the Perjod 1 sugust-30 September
sts

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information
| REFERENCE : HMMA-37623, 4 August 1969 (Last Progress Report)

1, Although this report might normally be Submitted one month
from-now, the use of-Oliver G, SCANTLING. kas shifted sufficiently
to warrant a special report at this time, Our next progress report
will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 December un-
less exceptional circumstances justify another change.

2. Tho fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who has
suifered tho past six weeks from paratyphoid) is that he. has been
divorced from routine cut-out operations and will henceforth be
used for priority tasks and targets which will better utilize his
proven talents, First, in late September ZARROCK took over LICASA-1
for direct handling, The LICASA operation offered no particular
challenge to SCANTLING and it is doubtful that his intermediary role
offered any particular additional security in this case, In fact,
if a flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add
one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the
GON. Second, it has been decided that SCANTLING will very. soon turn
LIANVIL-1 over to Raymond GERENDE, The details are presently boing
worked out, ———

3. PLANS: In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for re-

itment efforts principally (and less so for routine agent handling)

tly preparing for a recruitment attempt against Subject ‘of

1502. When that operation is completed he will be tar~
Eere fainst the MIHARSH target both through a commercial outlet of
the Bloc and through various clubs and sports centers where he may
have access to MHHARSH types. . Aside from these responsibilities, he
will be used as needed in other recruitmen: is especially in
support of a new surveillance team.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Officer, Western Hemisphere

Division
VIA : WH/FI '
WH/CONTRACTS
SUBJECT : Recommendation to Amend the Contract of

Raymond H. GERENDE (Contract Agent) to
Include Improved Termination Benefits
and a Salary Increase

1. During the past year Mexico City Station has
submitted several dispatches recommending that paragraph

11 of Subject's contract be amended to include new benefits
in the event of Subject's termination and/or resignation
from Agency service, These Station recommendations have
been carefully reviewed by C/WH/Contracts and a Memorandum
was forwarded to C/WH/1 containing guidance on the suggested
contract amendment.

“2. The above information has been reviewed again by
AC/WH/1,, and we are requesting approval for the following’
endments to. paragraph 11 of Subject's contract:

“A) In the event of GERENDE's termination by the
Agency he will receive three month's pay plus one
month's pay for every full year-of service since
18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at
‘the time of termination.

B) In the event of resignation and/or voluntary |
retirement upon 60 days notice the following schedule
would be acceptable to the Agency as being in its best
interests and a payment considered as a terminal payment
as follows:

(1) Less than 15 years service (prior to March
1970) 20 days pay foreach full year of service.

(2) Over 15 years:service, but less. than 20
years service (prior 18 March 1975) three months
Salary plus 20 days pay for each full year of: service.

3.

(3) Over 20 years service, three months
salary plus one month's pay for each full year
of service. F

(4) All payments above are to be calculated
at the rate of pay applicable at the time of
retirement and/or resignation,

As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their

Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note
the following:

A). GERENDE is a Mexican citizen, working for the

Agency since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, who considers
himself to be a "career" employee of the Agency, and

whose initial local employment for cover Purposes was
largely notional under a system of "ghost Payroll ling".

GERENDE received no income or bencfi

Position which terminated due to the demise of the
company on 31 December 1967. GERENDE's other "cover"
is self generated in that he gives English lessons in
bis spare time to middle management Mexican nationals
employed by American owned companies in Mexico City.
His income benefits from this "cover" are minimal, but
suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source

of his income. In conclusion, GERENDE is considered by
tw. the Station to be a full time contract agent, on call
“at all times for operational activity. Any other local

benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of his

being a Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern
of this Agency given the above circumsta:

ment with us.

4.

This Branch is of the belief that the resignation

and/or retirement schedule outlined ‘in Paragraph 2, B above
Provides career benefits for GERENDE in the event that he

must resign and/or retire in the event of unforseen personal

circumstances, It additionally rewards him for his loyalty.

of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive
to remain in Agency service for the additional financial
benefits that will accrue to him providing both future
security and incentive.

5. During the past two years GERENDE has served as
a principal agent handler fcr a sensitive fixed sur-
veillance project; has carried out, unilateral recruitment
approaches against the Cuban target; has been used in
special support investigations; and is presently being
considered for use in spécial operations of a sensitive
nature. .A review of the, progress reports. in GERENDE's
operations discloses that the Station has been more than
satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to
take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's ‘last
salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per. annum was granted
in July 1965, and there have been no increases since.
Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over.
amendment of paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract has been
in progress for over one year and a half, we are of the
bélief that thé Station wished to finalize this amendment
prior to requesting a salary increase for the agent. It
is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval
be given for a salary. increase from $6,500 to $7,000 ef-
fective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended.
The Field Station will be queried for their approval via
cable prior to implementation of the contract amendment.

1, In preparing a recent request for an amendment to Raymond
H. GERENDY's contract, it occurred to us that it would probably be
useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERLNDE's cover status.
As a full-time contract ageat, GERENDH is on call at all times tor
operational activity, His cover uctivity not only provides hin wita
the necessary flexibility, it is also solid enough to provide him
with a plausible explanation of his existence and his incono.

a 2. GERENDE has two major cover activities, One is the teaching
of English, mainly to middle-manayement personnel of American-owned

firms in Mexico City, This ‘is done on a regular basis for a few 95*4

“hours each day and carns GERENDE an income of about 5000 iy a cover

cMonth, His second cover activity, and-one which is largely a
and not really activity, is working ag a salesman for IDEN At
sactually earns only about 500 pesos per month from this, but this tac
is a closely guarded secret. GERIXDK'S acquaintances assume -that a
, ood part of his income comes from this cover. Previously, GERENDE
% had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month,
x ostensibly from IDEN B, IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for years
Yo he had carried GERENDE on his payroll as an independent salesman on
commission, He would ostensibly pay GERENDE a certain amount of
money, and IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns and
social security based on this alleged payment. IDEN B would also
pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed. This

Bystem of "ghost payrclling" is quite common in Mexico, as everybody
gains: the company because its declared profit is lower than it
really is and, therefore, subject to less tax, and the individual
because he is ordinarily given a kickoack for ailowing his name to
be used (or in GERENDE's case, because it. provided cover).

3, . All this ended on 31 December 1967, when LISTERINE sold
IDEN B to IDEN A. For a while thereafter, GERENDE paid taxes oaly.
on the money he actually earned with IDEN A, which was, as stated,
about 500 pesos per month. As of 1 July 1968, however, LISTERINE
arranged, at GERENDE'’s request, to have his accountant (who continued
to handle GERENDE's taxes as a favor to LISTERINE) to lump together
@11 of GERENDE's earnings (from teaching as well as IDEN A) as
“professional earnings" and to file returns for GERENDE which included
the total amount, This is not quite as satisfactory as the old
arrangement (among other things GERENDN must now pay his own taxes)
but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate, Other than LISTERINE
and the accountant, no one knows. that GERENDE's ostensible earnings
have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person
who is aware of GERENDE'’s tie with WOFIRM,

‘ 1, The Station has finally compiled the information necessary
to answer the questions raised in Ret 8 and, in doing so, wishes to
repeat the request originally made in Ref A ‘to anend Raymond i.
GERENDE's contract to provide him with a certain amount of job security

2, First, Ref B raised the point that there had been no efficiend hy
reports written on _GERENDE or “evidence of outstanding periormance."
GERLNDE's performance has heen evaluated regularly witnin the context
ofthe regular LIZMPTY Project progress reports, and a review of the
past several reports will demonstrate that the Station has been more
than satisfied with GERLNDs's performance and is anxious to take
advantage ot his ful) potential, The Station does not believe,
however, that "evidence of outstanding performance" should be a
prerequisite for the type of contract anandment being requested, It
is perfectly true, as pointed out in Ref B, that the Station had gone
on record jn 1959 that GERENDE should not be paid a termination
bonus if he should resigu simply to net the extra money or to pursue
another career, By now, however, GERENDE has cast his lot with
WOFIRM, He re: 3.no other career, and to try to start one at
this point would be extremely difficult? on. the other hand, if he
should decide to try his hand at something else, the Station would

undoubtedly wish to reward his long years of loyal service with a
generous termination payment, He has earned it, asd only termination

(for cause per paragraph 10 (b) of his contract wculd prevent him
from receiving it,

3. Mexican law (it is the law, not custom) says that an employee
who is fired must be paid three nonths* salary plus twenty days'
Salary for each full year employed by the company at the pay rate
lexisting at the time of separation, G:RENDE's current cover company
adheres to this formula, Since GeRENDi's termination clause has
always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for every
year of service (in the event of his termination by WOFIRM), we would
not want to change that, and in fact we wish to ad¢ to it the three
nonths' pay guaranteed by Mexican law, At the sane time, we do see
some virtue in the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Pet B that full
retirement benefits (in the event of GERENDE's resignation) would
apply only aiter 20 years' service, with lesser benefits until then.
Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to
15 full years of service (i.e. prior to 18 March 137U) he be paid
twenty days' salary tor each rull year, that aiter 15 years but prior
to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full montns’ salary, and that
aiter 20 years he be paid three months’ salary plus one months’ salary
for every iull year. It is true, of course, that Mexican law does
not make any provision for payment of a termination bonus to an
. employee who resigns, but most enlightened companies have some sort
of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out, "working
for WOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional financial
consideration,” In the case of GERENDE, we are not attempting to
establish any pattern, This is a special case (as are most) and the
Station:merely wishes to insure that GERENDE, who has made WOFIRM a
Career without receiving any career beneiits in return, is rewarded
for his loyalty and is given some incentive for the future. GERENDE
‘YS not without his faults, and he is being adequately compensated for
the work he performs, but we cannot expect to get nore out of him
without showing bim greater respect,

,

4, The Station requests, therefore, that the following amendment
ibe made in paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract:

&. In, the event of GERENDE's termination by WOFIRM, he will
receive three months’ pay plus. one month's pay for every full
year: of.service since 18 March 1955, calculated at the rate
applicable at the time of termination,

b. GERENDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be
accepted by WOFIRM as being in its best interest, and GERENDE
will be eligible for terminai- payment according to the following
formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERENDE will receive. 20 days"
pay for every full year of service since 18 March 1955; after 18
March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GERENDZ will receive
three months! pay plus 20 days for every full year since 18
March 1955; Giter 18 March 1976 GERENDE will receive three months
pay plus one month for every full year of service since 18.March
1955, All payments are to be calculated at the rate applicable
at the time of resignation.

5. Paragraph 10 (b) will, of course, remain in force.
6. Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another

year without change. We assume that this has been done, although we
have not been notified.

Summary

1. During the reporting period, the project's principal
agent, Raymond H. GERENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed
at broadening his usefulness to the Station, These tasks
included spotting and assessment as well as the handling ofa
recruited agent, ERFAIN~3.%°GERENDE did well, and it is believed
that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the sane.
token, the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset, The
LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate
and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper—
ations, The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIEMPTY-G, ———~
were terminated on 31 May 1968, Termination was decided upon
partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measure
ably decreased. the reliability and cffectiveness of LIEMPTY-6's
work, LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC. Base
House to give us the samo total hours of coverage as LILYRIC
and LIMITED had together in the past.

GERENDE

2.: During the reporting period, tne case officer has been
meeting GERENDE an average of three times per week. Meetings
are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Neetings
average 20 to 30 minutes. GERENDE turns over to the case
officer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has
picked up from the base houses Since the previous meeting,
along with brief contact reports on his meetings with base
house representatives, Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc~
tions, notes: for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge=
ments which may be desired by the Station. -Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting. (The departure
of. LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber, AS a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIACUTE~1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber, -
GERENDE's wife, LIEMPTY~19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes. She does the work in her home, and GERENDE transports the

tapes.)

3. GERENDE has the direct agent~handling responsibility for
the following LIEMPTY agents: _ LIEMPTY~4 (photo-processor; net
twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week. until
termination); LIEMPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per week -~ in his absence LIENPTY=-27 makes
meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). Ho is
responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling
all of the administrative problems which may develop. To judge
from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents
and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them <- particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel,

‘

4. As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the
Mexican MHRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit,
His MHRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,
but we expect it to start picking up again, GERENDE has con-
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and we have instructed him to try to get
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL
delegation as possible.

5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had perforned
nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational
lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the
same. .Furthermore, GERENDE'S standing assignments: (LIEMPTY.
base houses, MHRAVEL activity, and occasional support 01 JiROD
requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough
of GERENDE’s tine. GERENDE is. rather firmly. committed to
WOFIRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOFIRM for
over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any.
consequence. By the same token, he was, through no fault of
bis own, doing less work for WOFIRM than at any time in his
career. GERENDE'S operational exposure through the years _
dictated mots and Woe TEStriclions on Nis activity,. for sound
security reasons, The solution to GERENDE’S problem (lack oF
a promising future) and the Station's (not ‘getting its money's:
worth) seemed to be to give GERENDE additional tasks which he
could handle under suitable cover ‘and with due regard to security
precautions, Since most of GERENDS's support activities had

be taken in committing him further in this direction, It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in
a non-FJSTEAL field. :

G, In line with the above reasoning, GERENDE was introduced
on 17 February 1968 he idea was that
wou e trained to assist n some of his

operations against targets. GERENDE's principal
duty thus far has bi over the handling of ERFAIN-3,
under lose supervision and guidance. GERENDE has
performed quite creditably in this task, . He seems interested
in the work and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting, If GERLNDE can overcome this (and both case
officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of
prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be cvery reason
to believe GERENDE will develop into a competent agent handler,

7. GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing
(in alias) a girl who, por LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT, Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the
assignnent, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and
Gaining her confidence. It is quite likely that he cquld have
recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODENT, but as
this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was
launched and it was not felt. that attempting to recruit the girl
Would serve any useful purpose, for tho time being at least
(among other things, there was no indication that she bad had
any contact with AERODENT for some months). The only flaw in
GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to get around to
doing the job. It should be mentioned, however, that at the
Same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal “matters to
attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though
construction is still not entirely completed,

8. Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the
reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a
listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian
translator working. for the KERAVEL committee,

1. Before amending GZZENDE'’s contract in accordance vith
reference, we vould like to clarify a few points about GERENDE
and about terminations and resignations in general.

2. We assuze from the files that GEREEDE's performance has
been entirely satisfactory but since there are no efficiency re-
ports or actual evidence of outstanding performance, ve would
like to have a statement from the station which would justify the
requested amendsent, Nine years ago the station said, in INDiA.
13571 that “station would not want to give GERENDE a terminal
payment if he electa to resign just to receive some extra soney
or to parsue some other career." That vas a long time ago, how-
ever, and thirteen years of loyal collaboration may very well
have changed your mind on this point.

contract the proviso that. full retireaent benefite (three sonths
salary plus one month's lary for each yeir worked) should apply
after, say, twenty year's service, vith lesser benefits to apply
between nov and then? i

4. Could you recapitulate for us the prevailing Mexican law
or custom (which ts 1t?) oa termination-at-the-convenience-of-the-
esplayer? A aunber of months ago you told us that it was three
months pay plus 20-days-per-year-workec, but the LIFIRE/4 and 5
MOC'a said thit "following local custos of termination subject only
bas to be paid one month's salary for each year of employment".

Your propused GEKENDE terminal payment formule, (which way be a
special case rather than a pattern and which, as ve understand it,
makes no distinction between voluntary resignation and termination-
at-the-convenience-of-the-ewployer) is one sonth's pay for each

full year of employzent, plus three months pay at the rate applic-
able at the tine of termination. Does this imply that the one -
month's pay for cach year worked is conputed at the rate of pay pre~
vailing during each respective year worxed? Does Mexican law or
custom dictate the payment of terminal bonus to employees who resign
voluntarily? (Working for WOFIRM ia 8 very special cage, obviously,
and deserves exceptional financial consideration, but we do want to
understand the background as it applies to commercial work so that
we may have @ frame of reference or point of departure).

5. We apologize for the long delay in sending this dispatch.
It was originally written in Karch, and mislaid in transit, but we
thought it had been pouched.

6. Apart from the foregoing, do you recommend any changes in
GERENDE's contract which will be due for renewal on 1 October 19687
