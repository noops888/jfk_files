MEMORANDUN FOR: Chief, Western Henlaphere Division

SUBJECT

: Rayond H. GERENDE (P) and WIfe.

1.

Raymond H. GERENDE 18 a Mexican citizen and con

tract agent who has been employed by the Agency in Mexico

City since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, during which tine

he has served this agency well..

During the past fifteen

years GERENDE has been generally engaged in the area of

operational support activittes in Mexico City. For the

past two years he

served as a principal agent bandler

for a sensitive fied

survoillance project, LIEUPTY; was

used in unilateral rocruitment approaches against the

Cubar target; and

in special support investigasions.

ArS: GRENDE, whO

Is LIEMPTY/19, has beeu employed off

and on BIDce

1958 as a support asset, (transcriber/trang

lator)

under. kOC,

and during the

past two yoarg has worked

Intermittently transcribing unilatoral telephone tap tapes.

During the past year GERENDE and his wife have

had serious marital problens which culminated in a sept

ration in November 1969, and divorce actions sere initiated

by both partles.

The divorce proceedings are still in

the courts, and

bitter disputos, have reaulted

between both

parties concerning custudy of the children, division of

personal property, and the nonetary settlenents.. The above

problen is compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knous

in sone considerable detail of GERENDE'S activities on

behalf of the

Abines and 1f she exposed him, it could lead

to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and pos-

aible compronise of operations LIEMPTY, LINESA, LIMBRACE,

and LifEAT,

as well as numerous individual Station assets

such as LISTERINE, LIRAZOR/1, LIBAND/L, and David l.

WILSTED (P) •

Since late 1909,

Station has

been in touch with both GERENDE and hia wite on this prob

len, and every effort has been made by the Station to have

both parties settle the divorce anicably and to protect

GEIENDE's cover and that of the projects.

Because of the

above family problems which threatened GERENDE's personal

cover and security, he vas relleved of all operational

responsibilities and placed on half salary in Decenber 1969.

3.

In March of 1970,

Station docided

that GERENDE's personal problems were not being resolved,

and because of the continuing security threat, plans vere

made to terminate both GERENDE and his wife by

the end of

FY 1870.

The LIEUPTY Project reneval, approved in May

1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for

GRRENDS of $10,000 for 15 yeare of service with the Agency,

and in addition approval was roceived to pay Hrs, GERENDE

the sua of $2,500 as a security neasure designed to keep

ber fron revealing her husband's icency affiliation and

what she knous about Agency operations in Hesico..

• This

project approval carried the ADDi Scaveat that the ter

mination bonuses to both GERENDE and bia wile be paid on

& monthly basig rather than do one lump sun as a security

neasure to assure at least an elonent of control over

both individuals, since the continued receipt of these

monthly paysents depended on their loyalty to the agency.

GERINDE and bla wife wore terminated by Station represen

tatives

on 26 June 1970 under st ndard Ayuney:

procedures, and separate Quit Clains and Secrecy Agree-

monte were signed by both CERENDE and bia wife. Neither

GERIDE bor his wife had any objection to the wording of

the Quit Claing or the Security agreements, and both

appeared to bo satisfied with the terms of

the settlement,

and with the fairnese of the Agened's position.

On 8 July 1970 at 1115 bouro,

Mrs. GERENDE appeared

at the main gate of the Headquarter'g

building, and requested

to see an official from the cfive d Security. During tho

subsequent interview, Mrs. GERENDE established her identity,

and supplied the interviewer with dotalla on her and ber

husband's past employment with the Agency in Mexico City

and the fact that they had terminated said employment in

late June 1970.

HIE. CERENDE made three specific requeste

of the Agency:

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: GERENDE's Wife's Visit to Washington

On 6 July 1970, Hr. Walt Raymond of the CA

Staff

advised that GERENDE's wife was in Washington

and had been in touch with him.

Apparently Mr.

Ramond and GERIDE's wife had been acquainted for

admits that Mr. Raymond

is an Agency employee.

she wanted to get in

touch with someone in Agency

Headquarters®

Mr. Raymond advised her he would contact

his liaison people to see what could be done.

2.

DIRECTOR 048632 was sent to the Station out-

lining this and requesting Station's advice as to

whether a Headquarters representative should meet with

GERENDE's wife.

73612 (IN I17477) outlined

details of the

termination or GERENDE and his wife and

recommended against seeing her.

I discussed this matter briefly with

Legal Counsel's Office, who felt even if Station

should recommend seeing GERENDE and his wife, that it

would be limited to WH Division representation.

On

T July I advised Mr. Raymond of the Station's answer

as contained

73612.

He said he would

contact GERENDE's wife approximately 8:30 of the evening

o1. I July, and tell her that his liaison contact had

been unable to find anyone who would see her.

Mr. Raymond

was uncertain as to what GERENDE's wife might do.

In short, LIEPTY reming a highly effectize and highly useful

support asset, whose product is obtained in ordur to be used

operationally, not simply collected for the lilos.

GETEDE

The GERMIDE problem is unquestionably a serious one.

are forwarding under soparate cover copies of several comoranda

prepared by GIRliDE. Ono outlines the history of his marital

probicss, another describes the current legal situation, and a

third outlines proposals for a settlement.

There is no

reconciliation.

The Station's position

with GENDE from the

start has been

that he must agree to an anicablo settloment with

his wife in order to insure that she would not foel forced to take

steps which would jeopardize the gecurity of Station operations.

For this reason, the Station insisted f'on the beginning that any

financial sottlemont with his wife would have to take into account

the fact that he was receiving a certain salary fron Brock, and

that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on

the grounds that his wife could eate no lezal claim to that

salary, GRINDE's wile was made avare of our position on this, and

she was frateful, even though

she realized that this arrangement

was strictly informal.

The Station felt that GERLNDE could not be

allored to uso his KVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his

wife; because if he did, she could hardly be expocted to refrain

exposing his connections, Indeed, events have shown that

¡GERE:DI's wifo is a vindictivo vozan,

and if it had not boen clear

to her that she, as well as GERmiDE, would lose money if he loses

his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago.

GRINDE, 10r

his par", would have preferred to keep his rock salary entirely

out of the picture. Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station

position vas fals, and he said he would conform.

• The attachco memoranda fron GERINDE are, In the Station's

opinion, busically fair accounts.

In the beginning.

the Station

was inclined to give GERINDE'S Wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of tha

doubt, largoly because her description of GRIDE's character

weaknesses came as no surprise (particularly his tendency to

procrastinate,

Early in the

conflict, LIEUTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and aslied point blank what

she could tell her lawyer about GRADE's salary.

She was told

sbe could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,

and that if she told anyone that GRENDE bad any connection with

LENPURE,

the connection would be denied and GRINDE would be

terminated.

She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it

meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the

level of GERINDE's overt income (GRaDE's nonthly salary fron

RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos

teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which

he is receiving slightly. less than 7,000 pesos monthly).

Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it

that as long as GERINDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, be.

would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts

deterained should be paid from his overt incone.

This, of course

was strictly an informal arrangement,

one which

would stop

the

minute GRENDE stopped receiving a

salary.

Later, as LIEPTY-19°g

position hardened and her vindictiveness began to rule her actions,

LIENPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took for

an anicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance

that GERENDE would lose his job.

If she persisted in having him

arrested (which she succeeded in doing twice), his job would be

jeopardized.

While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had no

Intention of causing his terination, and bad never breathed a

word to a soul about his RVROCK aifiliation, her attitude ras in

fact jeopardizing his job and 11 he lost his job,

she and the

children, as well as GIPEDE, would lose incone.

Her attitude is

doubly disappointing in view of the fact that is she became nore and

more unrcasonable, chulbe ras noving in the othei direction.

The outcone can still not be predicted.

As can be seen

From GRRENDE's menos, the tro sides are still for apart on a nuaber

of points,

including specifleally money. LInDTY-19

insists on

10,000 pesos per sonth.

GabiDE 15 silling to pay 5,000.

Frois this, he would not only

havo to pay the amount which is finally agreed upon,

he mist also

continue payments di 2500 pesos por month to LIPTY-l!'s father

paying off a loan obtained to build their house).

The complicating

factor is the uncertainly of GERINDE'S future with RVROCK.

Station has maintained for sone

tine that it is impossible to

continue to pay GLINDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLI

and LILYRIC basehouses.

Now that L

has absorbed this duty

with only small inconvenionce and sone loss of timeliuess, it makes

even less sense to put GEPENDE to worl only to do this.

GERUNDE

has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and

prior to the current peroonal crisis he had been told that he

would have to work harder at a creater variety of tasks in order

to retain his position. As Headquarters is avare, ho had been

given auditional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun

to respoud very well.

There has never been any question of GERADEs

ability.

As we have proviously stated, he is personable, intelligent,

bilingual and bination, and has had good training and exporienco

In ceriain fields.

On the other hand, there has long been doubt

about his seriousness of purpose, his

initiative, and his ambition.

The "roversnl of roles" which he describes in one of the attached

menos, which took place when he was confined to his hose as an

It keeper, did more than cause domestic problens - it apparently

deprived him of the discipline of a daily job.

His well-desorved

reputation for boing Inzy was oarned years ago.

6.

The question which

must be answered is whethor or

not to terminate GERINDE.

He can be useful to the Station, but

the station has learned to got along without him.

What are the

security hazards involved?

The fencral range of

his knowledge is

described in paragraph 5 of reference.

If all of this tere blown,

the loss to the Station, particularly in terns of support operations

againsts the MIHARSH target, would be considerable.

The Station

does not beliove that GUlENDE would deliberately expose any of this,

abut it is impossiblo to predict what LIENPTY-19 might do, particularly

since she would feel that she had nothing to dose,

havirg already

clost a possible

source of income through the termination.

GERENDE ' 5

termination bonus would probably be 'in the neighborhood of ten

thousand dollars: Presumably LIEIPTY-19 is avare of the fact that

he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed

this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the

two of them has never been mentioned.

LICALLA

The LICALl basehouse continues to fuuction without changes,

except for the fact that

has been meeting LIE IPTY-9

The LILYNIC coverage is a fanily enterprise

who sphit up the hours of duty so that there is uninterrupted

coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays..

(Extra-hour or week-end coverage may

be requested as necessary, and the LILYRIC personnel responded to

the Station request for such extra coverago during the ASIDRIFF

and AESEASICK cases.)

The family has continued to provide reports

during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front

entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy.

Such coverage included,

as in the

past, daily logs on the comings and goings. of MHARSH officials,

up-to date recording of SHHARSA license numbers, special activities

and visitors (particularly. Americans, of whom five were spotted and

reported on during the reporting period), and sone 3, 500 photograpbs.

As an example of the value of LILIRIC coverage, within one week of

the change of license plates at the SUHARSH Embassy (a biannual change

SECURITY

10.

Other than the security problems inherent in GIRLIDE's

personal problems, there have been no security problems during the

reporting poriod.

FUTURE PLANS

11.

As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion

that he must be terminated.

This is not an easy decision to make,

nor will it be easy to confront GRINDE with this decision.

He

has, after all, dovoted 15 years of his lifc to RVROCK.

However,

as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able

therefore,

Intends to terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970.

GERINDE'S

contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per

full year.

This would come to $8,750 (USD).

For various reasons,

Including

the need to preserve the security of the operation by

ensuring that the termination is anicable, it will probably be

necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000

(USD) •

Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIBPTY-19 of

The

Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound from

a security point of vier to use the money which GERENDE himself has

earned for this purpose:

Therefore, while the figure will remain

negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD)

would be a reasonable anount.

We had alrrady talked about divorce before

consider parting with the children and she said she would consider

leaving them to me if I would settle the deut to her father as woll

as give her a substantial share of what she considered was her part

The title of the house was in ry name and had been

since the buying of the laid.

LILPTI-19 said I could noityage or

sell the house but that the money was what she was nainly intercsted

I told her that the sale of the house vas not finarcially

to this was the sentimental attachment to the house and area.

LIENPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE fOr

building the house at ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy

the house and that GEHENDE, knowing they were narried under

the separate proporty mrriago clauseld wrongfully placed

tho property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.

Actually,

the land was bought

by GENEVDE before Christnas 1965

In'a complicated transaction involving three other partners:

Robert Bancroft FHITZHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA,

and Janes

Walter HURLEY, and each of

the partners placed the property

in their respective names with the conplete knowledge of their

spouses.

Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen

months the deeds were issued.

LIE PTI-19 supervised and prodded

the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware

that the property was in GRENDE's name.

In August 1967 when

construction of the house began, LIDNPTY-19's father's noney

was used which he had deposited

in lexico for the purpose.

Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan

agreement, GERINDE has been paying it off and has receipts IrOn

LIE PTY-19 to show for it.

GRENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")

LIRAZOR/ProgNess Report for the Pariod 1 Ausust-30 September 1969

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information

REFERENCE

: HNNA-37623, 4 August 1969 (Inst Progress Report)

1.

Although this report migat nornally be subritted one nonth

from now, the use of Oliver G. SCANTLING tas shifted sufficiently

to warrant a special report at this time.

Our next progress report

will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 December un-

less exceptional circunstances

justify another change.

2.

Tho fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who bas

suifered tho post six wecks from paratyphoid) is that he has been

divorced fron routino cut-out operations and will henceforth be

used for priority tasks and taigets which will better utilize lis

proven talents.

First,

in late September ZARBOCK took over LICASA-1

for diroct handling.

The LICASA oporation offered no particular

challengo to SCASTLING and it is doubtful that his intormediary role

offered any particular additional security in this caso.

In fact,

1f & flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add

one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the

GOM.

Second,

it has been decided that SCANTLING will very soon turn

LIANVIL-l over to Raymond GERENDE.

The details are presently being

worked out.

3.

In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for re-

,cruitment efforts principally (and less so for routine agent handling)

he is presently preparing for a recruitment attempt against Subject oi

When that operation is completed he will be tar-

geted against the SMIlARSK target both through a commercial outlet of

the Bloc and through various clubs and sports centers where he may

have access to HARSll types.

Aside from these responsibilities,.

will be used as needed in other recruitment situations especially in

support of a new surveillance team.

service, three monthg

salary plus one month's pay for each full year

service.

(4) All payments above are to be calculated

at the rate of pay applicable

at the time of

retirement and/or resignation.

3. As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their

Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note

the following:

AJ. GERENDE

is a lexican citizen, working for the

Agency since 18

March 1955 under an MOC, who considers

himself to

be a "career" employee of the Agency, and

whose initial local employment for cover purposes was

largely notional under a system

of "ghost payrolling".

GERENDE received no income or benefits from this "cover"

position which terminated due to the demise of the

company on 31 December 1967.

GERENDE's other "cover"

is self generated in that he gives English lessons in

his spare time to middle management Mexican nationals

employed by American owned companies in Mexico City.

His income benefits from

this

"cover" are minimal, but

suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source

of his incone.

In conclusion, GERENDE is considered by

the Station to be a full time contract agent,

on call

at all times for operational activity.

Any other local

benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of his

being & Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern

of this Agency given the above circumstances of his employ-

ment with us.

This Branch is of the belief that the resignation

and/or retirement schedule outlined in paragraph 2, B above

provides career benefits for GERENDE in the event that he

must resign and/or retire in the event of unforseen personal

circumstances.

It additionally rewards him for his loyalty.

of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive

to remain in Agency service for the additional financial

benefits that will accrue to him providing both future

security and incentive.

5.

During the past two years GERENDE has served as

a principal agent handler for a sensitive fixed sur

veillance project; has carried out unilateral recruitment

approaches

against the Cuban target; has been

used in

special support investigations; and is presently being

considered for use

in special

operations of a sensitive

nature.

A review of the progress reports in GERENDE'S

operations discloses that the Station has been more than

satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to

take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's last

salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum was granted

in July 1965, and there have been no increases since.

Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over

amendment of paragraph 1l of GERENDE's contract has been

in progress for over

one year and a hall, we are of the

belfef

that the Station wished to

tinalize this amendment

prior to requesting a salary increase for the agent.

It

is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval

be given for a salary increase from $6,500 to $7,000 ef-

fective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended.

The Field Station will be queried for their approval via

cable prior to implementation of the contract amendment.

Raymond H. GRINDE'S Cover Status

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

In preparing a recent request for

amendment to Raymond

H. GERIND.'s contract, it occurred to us that it would probably be

useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERLNDE's cover status.

As a full-time contract agent, GEKEND is on call at all times for

operational activity.

His cover activity not only provides hin wito

the necessary flexibility,

it is also solid enough to provide hin

with a plausible explanation of his existence and his incono.

GERINDE has two major cover activities. One is the teaching

öt English,

mainly to middle-management personnel of American-owned

In Mexico City.

This 'is done on a regular basis for a few

-hours each day and carns GERINDE an income of about 5000 pesos per

His second cover activity, and one which is largely a cover

and not really activity,

Is working as a salesnan for IDiN A. GREND:

actually corns only about 500 pesos per month

irom this, but this lact

is a closely guarded secret.

GERINDk's acquaintances assume: that a

good part of his income

comes from this cover.

Previously, GERENDE

CEASA

had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month,

ostensibly from IDay.

IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for yearg

Te had carried GEFEND:

on his payroll as an independent salesman on

commission. He would ostensibly pay GERENDE a certain arount of

money, and

IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns

Social

and

on this alleged payment.

IDEN B would also

pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed. This

system of "ghost payrclling" is quite common in Mexico, as everybody

gains:

the company because its declared profit is lower than it

really is and, therefore, subject to less

tax, and the individual

because he is

ordinarily

given a kickback for allowing his name to

be used (or in GRINDE's case, because it provided cover).

3.

All this onded on 31 December l9Gt, when LISTERINE sold

IDEN B

to IDIN A.

for a while thereafter, GERENDE paid taxes caly

on the money he actually earned with IDEN A, which was, as stated,

about 500 pesos per montl.

As of l July 1968, however, LISTERINE

arranged, at GRENDE's request, to have his accountant

who continued

to handle GRENDE'S taxes as a

favor to LISTERINE) to lump together

all of GRINDE's earnings (from teaching as well as IDEN A)

AB

"professional earnings" and to file returns

for GERENDE which included

the total amount.

This

is not quite as satisfactory as the old

arrangement (among other things GRINDE must now pay his own taxes)

but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate.

Other than LISTERINE

and the accountant, no one

knows that GERINDE's ostensible earnings

have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person

who 1a aware

of GERINDE's tie with WOFIRM.

undoubtedly wish to reard his long years of loyal service with a

generous termination payment.

He has earned it,

and only termination

for cause per paragraph 10 (b) oi his continet sculd prevent him

fron receiving it.

Nexican law (it is the law,

not custom) says that an employce

who is fired nust be paid three months" salary plus twenty days®

salary for each full year employed by the company at the pay rate

existing at the time of separation.

GERINDE'S

current cover company

adberes to this formula.

Since GERENDE'S termination clause has

always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for every

year of service (il the event of his termination oy wOFIR!), we would

not want to change that, and in fact we wish to add to it the three

months' pay guaranteed by Mexican law.

it the sase time, we do see

some virtue in the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Rel B that tull

retirement benefits (in the event of GRINDE's resignation) would

apply only aiter 20 years' service, with lesser lenefits until then.

Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to

15 full years of service (1.e. prior to 18 March 1570) he be paid

twenty days' salary for each lull year, that aiter lo yoars but prior

to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full months' salary, and that

aiter 20 years he be paid three nonths' salary plus one months' salary

for every lull year. It is true, of course,

that Mexican law does

not make any provision for payment of a termination bonus to an

employee who resigns, but most enlightened companies have some sort

of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out, "working

for HOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional

consideration."

financial

In the case of GEREND:, we are nos attempting to

establish any pattern.

This

is a special case (as are nost) and the

Station merely wishes to insure that GERINDE, who has made

wObIRd a

career without receiving any career benelits

in return,

is rewarded

for his loyalty and is given

some incentive for the future.

GERENDE

Is not without his faults, and he is being adequately compensated for

the work he performs, but

we cannot expect to get nore out of him

without showing bin greater respect.

The Station

requests,

therefore, that the following amendment

be made in paragraph l1 o1 GERENDE's contract:

In the event

of GERINDE's tormination by WOFIRM, he will

receive three months' pay plus one month's par for every full

year-of service since

18 Narch 1955, calculated at the rate

applicable at the time of termination.

bo

GERINDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be

accepted by WOFIRM as being in its best interest, and GERENDE

will be eligible for terminal payment according

to the following

formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERINDE will recelve. 20 days*

pay for every full year of service since 18 larch 1955; after 18

March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GEREND will receive

three months' pay plus 20 days

for every full year since 18

larch 1955: after 18 March 1976 GERINDE will receive three months

pay

plus one

month for every full year of serrice since 18 March

1955.

All payments are

to be calculated at the rate applicable

at the time of resignation.

5. Paragraph 10 (b) will, of course, remain in force.

6. Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another

year without change.

We assume that this has been done, although we

have not been notified®

During the reporting period, the project's principal

agent, Raymond H. GERENDE,

was assigned additional tasks, ained

at broadening his usefulness to the Station.

These tasks

included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a

recruited agent, ERFAIN-3.* GERENDE did well, and it 1g believed

that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the same.

token,

the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset. The

LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate

and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper

ations.

The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIENPTY-6,

were terminated on 31 May 1968.

Termination was decided upod

partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur

ably decreased the reliability and cifectiveness of LIE!PTY-6'g

LIEMPTY-26 was rehired,

which permitted the LILYRIC. Base

House to give un the sano total hours of coverage as IllyRIc

and LIMITED had together in the past.

GERINDE:

2. During the reporting

the case officer has been

times per week.

Nectings

are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. leetings

average 20 to 30 minutes.

GERENDE turns over to the case

officer neratives, prints, logs, and other reports which he bas

picked up fron the base houses since the previous meeting,

alone with brief contact reports on his meetings with base

house representatives.

Reports on other operational activities

are also turned in and discussed, and GRINDE is given instruc

tions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge

ments which may be desired by the Station.

AlSo, LIENVOY tapes

and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting.

The departure

of. LIACUTE l at the end of April 1968 left the Station without &

BEDOX transcriber.

As a temporary solution, pending the return

of LIACUTE-l or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber,

GERENDE's wife, LIENPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50

pesos per hour

to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the

tapes.

She does the work in her home, and GRENDE transporte

the

tapes.)

GRENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for

following LIE.PTY agents: LIE:PT'-4 (photo-processor; net

twice per week); LIERPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week until

termination); LIEUPTYs 13,

14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEHPTY-13

normally met twice per week - in his absence LIE:PTY-27 makes

meetings); and LIENPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week).. Ho is

responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling

all or the administrative problems which may devclop.: To judge

from the results, GRENDE has excellent rapport with these agents

and is able to get a consistently high purformance rate from

then - particularly LICILlA and LILYRIC personnel.

As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the

Mexican MIRAVEL committee,

which we found a useful side benefit.

His SHRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,

but we expect it to start picking up again.

GERENDE has con-

ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within

the SHRAVEL complex, and wo have instructed him to try to get

en assignment which

will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL

delegation as possible.

5.

Reference

also pointed out that GERENDE had perforned

nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational

lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the

same.

Furthernore, GERINDE's standing assignments (LIESPTY

base houses, AHRAVEL activity, and occasional support oi JNROD

requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enougs

Of GERENDE's tire.

GERENDE is. rather firmly committed to

WOFIR by virtue of the fact that he has worked for NOFIRM for

over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any.

consequence.

By the same token,

he was,

through no fault of

his own, doing less work for WOFIRM! than at any time in his

career.

GERENDE's operational exposure through the years

dictated note and more restrictions on his activity, for sound

security reasons. The solution to GERIDE'S problem (lack of

a pronising future) and the Station's (not betting its money's:

worth) seemed to be to give GERENDE additional tasks which he

could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security

precautions.

Since most of GERENDE's

support activities had

been against the FISTEAl, target, particular care would bave to

be taken in cormitting hin further in this direction.:

It was

decided, thererore;

that his principal retooling would be in

G. In line with the above reasoning, GEREYDE was introduced

I on 17 February 1968. The idea was that

GERANDE would be trained to assist

In somo of his

operations ngainst

targets.

GrRIND's principal

duty thus far has been to tave over

the

handling of ERFAIN-3,

under

close supervision and guidance.

GERENDE has

perforned quite creditably in this task. He seens interested

in the work and has learned quickly.

On the other hand, an

apparently ingrained habit o! procrastination has resulted in

dilatory reporting.

If GENLIDE can overcome this (and both case

officers are working hard to teach GERFNDE the importance of

prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be cvery reason

to believe GRENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.

GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing

in allas a girl who,

por LIENVOY, was being cultivated by

AERODENT.

Ilthough GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the

assignment, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and

Gaining her confidence.

It is quite likely that he could have

recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODINT, but as

this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was

launched and it was not felt that attempting to recruit the girl

would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least

(among other things, there was

no indication that she had had

any contact with AERODENT for some months).

The only flaw in

GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to fet around to

doing the job.

It should be nentioned, however, that at the

same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to

attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,

which he finably moved into on 10 March 1968, even though

construction is still not entirely completed.

Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the

reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a

listening post; and initiating a relationship uith & Russian

transiator working for the KaRAVEL committee.

1.

Could you recapitulate for us the prevailing Mexican law

or custon (which to 1t?) on ternination-at-tbe-conventence-of-the-

told us that it was three

MoC's said thit "following local custon of termination subject only

has to be pald one conth's salary for each year of employsent.

Your propused GERINDE terminal payseat formula, (shich may be a

spectal case rather thau a pattern and shich,

as ve understand it,

makes no diatinction botween voluntary resignation and termination

at-the convenlence-of-the employer) is one wonth's pay for each

full year of employeent, plus three soothe pay at the rate applic

able at the tine of termination. Does this imply that the one

month's pay for each year worked is conputed at the rate of pay pre-

vailing during each respective year worked?. Does Mexican law or

custom dictate the payment of

terminal bonus to emplogees who resign

voluntarily? (Working for NOFIR! in a very special case, obviously,
