CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE

CAPABILITIES IN LATIN

AMERICA

THE PROBLEM

To describe and evaluate Castro's capabilities, with Soviet help,

for carrying out subversion and sabotage in Latin America after

satisfaction of all US conditions relative to the withdrawal of

strategic weapons systems from Cuba and a consequent US com-

mitment not to invade.

NOTE: In this estimate we have considered Castro's raw capabilities,

taking note of, but not working out in detail, US and Latin

American capabilities for counteraction.

SUMMARY

A. The dangerously unstable situation that prevails through-

out much of Latin America is the product of fundamental in-

equities and historic circumstances; it is not the creation of

Castro and the Soviets. Castro's efforts, with Soviet help. 1,0

exploit this situation by means of subversion and sabotage have

not produced significant results.

Propaganda exploitatics.

Castro and Cuba as symbols of revolution has probably beer more

effective to date than other subversive activities. Castros in-

fluence in Latin America had waned by the time of the missile

base crisis and was further reduced by the revelation that he

had accepted Soviet strategic missile bases on Cuban soil and

by the manner of the Soviet decision to withdraw them.

B. Implementation of an agreement between the US anc the

USSR whereby the strategic weapons systems would be with-

drawn and the US committed not to intervene in Cuba with jorce

will leave Castro with a new immunity and a greater freedom

for subversive actions throughout Latin America. The extent

to which this potential is realized will depend upon the situation

in Cuba, Soviet policy toward Cuba, and the policies and perform-

ance of the other Latin American governments and of the T'S with

respect to the Castro threat.... There are many targets in the

hemisphere vulnerable to Castro-Communist subversion and sab

otage, and the Soviets are likely to assist Castro in reaching them

by contributing both to his security at home and to his capability

for action overseas. As in the period before the missile base

crisis, the effect of Castro's subversive activities will depend not

only upon his capabilities but upon the attractiveness of the

Cuban example and the willingness of the American governments

to take determined counteraction. This willingness will probably

be weakened by fulfillment of the US commitment not to invade

Cuba.

C. We have examined how Castro's subversive potential would

be affected by alternative courses of Soviet policy regarding Cuba:

(1) virtual withdrawal of support; (2) continuation of economic

and military support ranging from present up. to substantially

increased levels. We believe that course (1) would considerably

reduce Castro's subversive potential, and that the Soviets are

unlikely to elect it. We conclude that Soviet course (2) would

maintain Castro's potential for subversive action at least at pres,

ent levels or actually raise it to the point where he could under-

take amphibious and/or airborne subversive operations against

close-in targets.

THE ESTIMATE

1. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE MISSILE BASE CRISIS'

Aims

1. From the time of his accession to power Fidel Castro has sought to

gain acceptance of the Cuban revolution as a model for others and of

himself as the leader of revolutionary forces throughout Latin America.

He has constantly sought to foment revolutions in other Latin American

States. Moreover, Castro has generally had the support of the Sino-

Soviet Bloc in the pursuit of these aims.

Means

2. Castro began his career of sponsorship for revolutions in Latin

America in 1959 with landings of small rebel forces in Nicaragua, Pan-

ama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. None of these were successful

and he turned to other means.

3. From the beginning, propaganda has been one of the principal in-

struments on which Castro has relied. In addition to the main trans-

missions of Radio Havana for external listeners, which have had a great

deal of revolutionary content, he has beamed special programs devised

to stimulate revolutionary action to each of half a dozen selected

countries? A major effort has been made through Prensa Latina, the

Cuban news service, to disseminate Castro-Communist propaganda.

Printed propaganda has also been sent from Cuba into most other

Latin American States, and Cuban diplomatic missions and personnel

have actively disseminated it. Students returning from indoctrination

in Cuba have helped establish Cuban Institutes for Friendship among

Peoples which have functioned as propaganda outlets.

4. Thousands of Latin: Americans have been brought to Cuba; about

1,200 foreign trainees are believed to be there now. Many hundreds

have been trained in revolutionary techniques and guerrilla warfare.

Cuba has been made a main transit point for travel between Latin

America and the Bloc.

5. Financial support has been provided by. Cuba to revolutionary

groups in a number of countries, although the cases on which we have

reports involved rélatively small sums of money. Arms shipments have

SECRET

also been reported, but the evidence is unclear as to quantities shipped

and the extent of Cuba's role in these transactions.

We believe that

there is an extensive agent net in Latin America directed from Havana.

6. Castro has associated himself with

revolutionary activist groups

throughout Latin America.

In most cases these have been Communist;

but where the regular Communist Party favored a legal or parliamen-

tary line he has not hesitated to support dissident Communist groups,

e.g., in Brazil, and non-Communist revolutionaries, e.g., in Guatemala

and El Salvador. In some cases he has sponsored new revolutionary

organizations, e.g., in Panama, Colombia, and Peru. In Chile he has

endorsed a popular front coalition made up of Communist and moderate

leftists.

Evaluation

7. Instances of financial and material support sent by Cuba to revolu-

tionaries in other countries which have come to our attention are

probably only a part of the total effort. Even so, the effort seems to

have been relatively small and ineffective. Yet along with the political

and psychological stimulus which Castro's influence has provided, Cuban

subversive activities have perceptibly strengthened activist revolutionary

groups. Dangerous situations subject to exploitation by Castro and

the Communists exist in a number of Latin American countries

notably Venezuela, Brazil, British Guiana, the Dominican Republic, and

Bolivia.

These dangers arise from political and social tensions which

existed long before Castro came to power.

They might lie dormant

for some time; but with Castro as a potential detonator, they are more

likely to blow up. The detonative compound will exist as long as Cas-

troism survives, whatever may happen to Castro personally.

8. The most dangerous aspect of Castroism has been its broad appeal

as a symbol of revolutionary change and nationalist assertiveness in

Latin America.

Propaganda from Cuba has taken advantage of this

fact and has almost certainly been a more important influence in the

Latin American situation than Castro's other subversive activities.

During 1960 and 1961 Castroism became a force to be reckoned with

politically in a number of Latin American countries. Certain govern-

ments felt obliged to move in the direction of neutralist and leftist posi-

This influence waned, however, after Castro identified himself

with the Bloc in late 1961. Nevertheless, the appeal to Castro's move-

ment continued to be a source of major concern to almost all govern-

ments and seriously restricted their willingness to associate themselves,

at least publicly, with the US.

11. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE POTENTIAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN

AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THE SOVIETS WOULD WITHDRAW

THEIR STRATEGIC MISSILES AND THE US GIVE ASSURANCES THAT

IT WOULD NOT INVADE CUBA

9.

Castro's subversive capabilities and his disposition to use them-

will be enhanced by the sense of security provided by such sophisticated

weapons as are retained in Cuba after the withdrawal of Soviet strategic

missiles. The IL-28 bombers, if retained, and other modern equipment

noted in Annex B, would be important in this regard.

• A US commit-

ment not to invade Cuba will further strengthen his sense of immunity

from reprisal and almost certainly encourage him to intensify subver-

sive activities in other Latin American countries.

Response of Castro Supporters to Missile Base Crisis

10. Castro's supporters throughout Latin America, with few though

important exceptions (e.g., sabotage of oil facilities in Venezuela), failed

to respond to the missile base crisis with effective acts of sabotage or

with impressive public demonstrations.

Two important limiting factors

should be taken into account in judging this response, however.

US:

action to alert Latin American governments led them to make extensive

advance preparation, including deployment of security forces and the

roundup of suspects, a condition of readiness which is unlikely to be

maintained indefinitely. There also may have been some uncertainty

guidance may have contributed to the confusion. It is our judgment,

however, that the response to Castro's appeal for attacks on the US -

and its friends indicates that his power to command revolutionary

action, at least in the circumstances of the missile base crisis, is limited,,

Support Which Castro Can Expect in the Future

11. The range of Castro's support has been, we believe, considerably

narrowed by events since Castro declared himself a Communist! Rev-

elation of the fact that he had allowed the Soviets to establish óffensive

bases under exclusive Soviet control has alienated many non-Communist

nationalists, genuine neutralists, and even revolutionaries seeking social

and economic betterment. San Tiago Dantas, formerly Foreign Min-

ister under President Goulart and an author of Brazil's nonalignment

policy, and leading Mexican officials have publicly expressed their

disenchantment.

12. The activist revolutionaries are probably the only important force

on which Castro can now count, but even their support has apparently

been rendered less effective by differences on the question of Soviet rela-

tions with Castro and with Latin American Communist parties.

Castro's Resources for Continued Subversive Activity

13. Arms. (See Annex B.) Castro has substantial stocks of arms.

In addition to Soviet Bloc materiel there are stores of arms inherited

from the Batista regime not being used by Castro forces and available

for distribution outside Cuba.

In the past he has apparently been ham-

pered in his efforts to use arms for subversive purposes by problems

of transport and delivery. He has at his disposal, however, 11 IL-14

transports belonging to Cubana airlines which could be used to deliver

arms under certain circumstances. The IL-28's now in Cuba are in-

appropriate for subversive purposes. However, they could be used for

air drops. Cuba has many small craft suitable for infiltration of men

and arms. The 6 Khronshtadt subchasers, 16 P-6 motor torpedo boats,

and 12 Komar missile boats obtained from the Bloc could also bé used

for arms deliveries. If the projected trawler base is built up, trawlers

both. Cuban and Soviet could be used for arms deliveries.

If Soviet

submarines call at the trawler base or at other Cuban ports, they, too,

could be used in support of subversive activities. We see no evidence

that Cuba has or is developing a sophisticated amphibious warfare

capability, and all the means of delivery of arms by sea noted above

would be vulnerable to precautionary measures by Latin American mil-

itary and naval forces.

14. Propaganda apparatus.

Castro's propaganda machine remains

intact. For the time being, however, his diplomatic missions are likely

to find it harder to disseminate propaganda than in the past, both be-

cause of new precautions by local governments and because of a reduc-

tion in the numbers of cooperative volunteers outside the organized

Communist groups:

15. Money and equipment. Despite differences between Castro and

the USSR concerning dismantling of the missile bases, we believe that the

Soviets will continue to supply Castro with money, supplies, and equip-

ment for subversive activity. The Soviets have certainly supplied Castro

with sophisticated instruments of intelligence collection, sabotage, and

clandestine communications.*

16. Organization. The organization of Castro's subversive

assets

throughout Latin America was shown by. the recent crisis to be loose

and otherwise faulty. We estimate that Castro will make a strong

effort to strengthen and improve it, and that he will continue to receive

support in this effort from the Soviet apparatus, both in Cuba itself,

where the Soviet Ambassador is a veteran officer of the KGB, and in

other important centers of Soviet activity such as Mexico City and

Montevideo.

Other Factors on Which Castro's Subversive Capability Will Depend

17. If the US and USSR reach and implement the agreement stated

in the problem Castro will gain an immunity which he lacked before the ,

missile base crisis.

He will, furthermore, still have most of the arms

and equipment which were delivered in the post-July buildup, as well:

as enhanced capabilities provided by accelerated training. Presumably

his enemies will have about the same, 'or less, freedom to engage in

propaganda, sabotage, support for resistance activities, and other actions

designed to overthrow Castro than they had before the crisis almost

certainly not more.

Unless Castro is gravely endangered by internal

political and economic problems, there is no reason to believe that anti-

Castro activities are any more likely to jeopardize his position than they

did before the crisis.

18. Situation in Cuba. Castro's ability to engage in subversive activ-

ities will be influenced significantly by the strength and stability of his

position at home. Heightened political and economic difficulties in

Cuba would restrict Castro's subversive effort, while the more secure

he is at home, the more freedom and strength he is likely to have for

subverting other governments and re-establishing his prestige and in-

fuence. Castro's position in Cuba will depend in part on his own

policies, but is likely to depend even more upon those of the Soviets.

19. Alternative Soviet policies. There are several courses of action

with respect to Cuba which the Soviets are likely to consider.

Some

the whole policy of economic and military

support for Castro should be abandoned along with the plan for the

deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. We believe, however, that

the Soviet stake in Cuba as an ally and as a Soviet center in Latin

America is still too high to abandon. The stake in Castro as a person,

however, is questionable. If the Soviets did make a decision to with-

draw support either from Castro or from Cüba, we believe that Cuban

capability for subversion in Latin America would be greatly reduced, at

least for a time. This capability would be reduced more in the case of

The Soviets" withdrawing support from Cuba than in the case of their

abandonment of Castro alone.

20. An alternative course would be for the Soviets to continue to

extend economic and military assistance.

Such assistance could range

all the way from the amounts necessary to maintain Cuba in its present

condition, including support of the expanded military establishment,

to substantial increases.

Such a policy would probably reduce con-

siderably Castro's internal problems and thus give him additional free-

dom to engage in external subversion and sabotage. Additions to Cas-

tro's stocks of small arms would not in themselves change his capa-

bility for subversive activity, as he already has supplies of surplus arms.

However, it the Soviets were to provide substantial additional air and

SECRET

sealift capability, the Cubans would be able to mount large-scale

subversive interventions in neighboring countries.

Furthermore, what-

ever degree of success is achieved in improving Cuba's position and in

expanding its physical resources, Cuba's net capability for subversion

and sabotage will in the last analysis largely be determined

by the.

overall situation in Latin America.

21. We do not believe that Castro or the Soviets can yet foresee what

the effects of the recent crisis will be over the long term on their rela-

tionship. The crisis has probably created difficulties of a political and

psychological nature that neither of them can readily solve, however

determined they may be to do so.

Castro may have been moved by the

treatment he has received at the hands of the. Soviets to consider

modifying his relationship with them and seeking to improve his rela-

tions with the OAS and possibly even the US.

We believe, however,

that he is unlikely to find feasible ways. of reducing his dependence

upon the USSR.

The Soviets certainly must consider that they

effective means of exerelsing contral over Castro. Furthermore, his ve

peated assertions of continued loyalty to Marxism-Leninism make it

unlikely that he is seriously contemplating a restoration of relations

with the OAS, or that he could succeed if he tried.

22. Policy of other American nations.

Castro's subversive capabilities

will be greatly influenced by the policies and actions of other Latin

American nations, as by those of the US. We believe that the high

state of security alert that has prevailed since 22 October and the show

of unity that marked the recent crisis are unlikely to last.

There is

sure to be a revival of nationalist sentiments. On balance, however,

we believe that the prospects for countersubversive action by Latin

American States, on their own and in conjunction with the US, are im-

proved. Many responsible Latin Americans will have interpreted recent

events to mean that firm and united action can be effective against

the Soviet threat from Cuba. However, Latin American governments

will probably be less willing to take coordinated action against Com-

munist inroads if the US commits itself not to invade Cuba.

Likely Future Targets for Cuban Sabotage

23. The extent of Castro's capabilities for sabotage and other clan-

destine activity in Latin America will depend upon the complicated

factors noted above. Whatever his capabilities are, he will not be at

a loss for targets against which to use them.

Some of the more obvious

targets are:

a. Us missions and personnel.

US missions and personnel all over

Latin America were designated as targets for attack in the various

calls for action which went out during the recent crisis. Action against

## Page 14

SECRET

such targets has a primarily political and propaganda value to Castro

in that it tends to show public opposition to US policy.

It is also rela-

tively easy for Castro to promote attacks against official US installations

in a crisis situation and to get help from all the various elements which

are opposed to American influence in the area. Future attacks may

be anticipated in situations in which Castro feels that the public resent-

ment of US policy exists or can be stirrea up.

b. Physical targets vulnerable to a limited sabotage effort. Prime

targets for sabotage will be mining, industrial, and business installa-

tions in which there is a large proportion of US capital, which are other-

wise associated with the US, or which are so important to the local

economy that damage to them would create difficulties for govern-

ments which are anti-Castro and cooperating with the US. Oil facilities

in Venezuela, including the oil and water pipelines to the refineries on

the Paraguana Peninsula, and similar facilities are likely to be chosen

as targets for Cuban sabotage. Installations for the handling of Vene-

zuelan iron ore are also likely objectives. US installations in Panama

might be attacked.

c. Port and communications facilities are generally vulnerable to

sabotage and are appealing targets to Cubans and other Latin American

Communists particularly in countries which are cooperating with the

US and whose communications media are taking an anti-Castro line.

Telephone, telegraph, radio and television facilities, and most public

utilities, particularly electric power and transformer stations, are poten-

tial targets. Selection of targets for sabotage will depend on the im-

portance of particular facilities but even more on the varying access of

Castroites and Communists to them.

d. Political targets susceptible to exploitation. Political instability

throughout Latin America, in almost every case characterized by pres-

sures from

below upon relatively conservative and generally anti-

Communist governments, provide Castro with opportunities for sub-

versive political activity. Particularly unstable situations include the

following:

(1) Venezuela, where Communist-inspired disorders have been kept

in check by the government, but where continued Communist

and leftist violence may lead the military to take control.

In a country such as Venezuela, where the stability of an anti-

Castro and anti-Communist government depends heavily upon

one man, assassination is another danger.

(2) Nicaragua, where Communist-led groups, in

anticipation of

coming elections, may seek to incite or exploit violence against

the Somoza regime.

(3) Guatemala, where President Ydigoras' position is weak and

uncertain.

(4) The Dominican Republic, where the problems of political recon-

struction after a generation of dictatorship have proved almost

more than the caretaker government can handie, and where

some political groupings amenable to Castro's influence are

seeking to gain a footing.

(5) Bolivia, where the struggle for dominance within the ruling

MR Party between the moderates and those on the far left

is ready-made for exploitation by Castro.

(6) Brazil, where Communists have penetrated the government

and military to some limited extent, the tide of nationalist and

anti-US feeling is strong, and depressed socio-economic condi-

tions and ineficient government administration provide Castro

many opportunities, especially in the northeast.

HAVENA'S INTERIIATICNAL BROADCASTT.IG

The Cuban Government uses three vehicles. for its radio propaganda to

audiences in other countries:

"Radio Free Dixie," "The Friendly Voice

of Cuba"" and MRadio Habana Cuba."

"Radio Free Dixie" is.a one-hour weekly transmission in English to

Negroes in the United States, broadcast over the facilities of Havana's

50-kilowatt eransmitter

"Radio Progreso" and its network of eight

relay stations situated throurhout Cuba. Robert F. Hillians, the North

Carolina Negro who fled

nappinp, is the director and chief commentator of this program, which is

heard every Friday night at 10 p.m. EST.

frequently crude language, Williams tells his "oppressed Horth American

brothers" that they are goins to have to "fill a lot of jails and a lot.

of graves, and not just with black boys, either," in order to achieve

"freedom

and social justice.". Assisting Hilliams are newscaster Carlos

Moore and "musical hostess" (disc jockey and commentator) Jo Salas.

"Radio

free Dixie" is heard very well in southern Florida.and can probably

be heard in many areas of the southern United States without elaborate

technical facilities.

* "The Friendly Voice of CubI," formerly a Dodular Havana radio station

known as

"Radio Mambi,

o" bezan broadcasting in May 1962.

although this

powerful station does not so announco, its

transmissions are apparently

intended for listeners in the United States.

"The Friendly Voice of

Cuba" broadcasts 'from

6:00 in the morning to 1:00 a.m. EST. All of its

programs, except for four seven-minute

Spanish news shows, are in

Enslish.

Its approach is a shade more

subtle than that of "Radio Free

Dixie."

It is heard best in southern florida, but can also be heard in

many. parts of the southern United States.

The official internationa: service called "Radio Habana Cuba" is con-

sidered to be the chief exteril radio propaganda outlet of the Cuban

Government.

More commonly known is "Radio. Havana," this station broad-

casts weekly' a total of 18i hours and 50 minutes of propaganda ir

languages which include Enflish, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish,

and Haitian Creole, to listeners

in Europe, the

Mediterranean area, and

the lestern Hemisphere.

"Radio Havana" is under the supervision of

Marcos Behemaras, deputy director (for international broadcasting) of the

year, when it began presenting a relatively modest schedule of programs

in English, French, and Spanish for Europe: and the Americas for a toral

of 42 hours a week. Since then, "Radio Havana" has grown by leaps and

bounds, finally emerging as Latin America's number one Intemational

broadcaster.

1. The World Peace Council (WPC) was expected to pay for the

expenses of the Continental Congress in Support of Cuba,

which is to be held in Rio de Janeiro from 28 to 30 March 1963,

according to comments made by General Luiz Gonzaga Leite,

president of the Society of Friends of Cuba (SAC), at a

meeting of the SAC on 21 January 1963.

2.

As of 21 January the SAC had not received any replies from

the invitations sent to the African nations to participate

in the congress.

It was announced

at the meeting that Valerio

Konder, acting president of the Brazilian Pro-Peace Movement

5

in early February and would take a copy of the convocation

for the congress

with him.

3. Plans were made for painting slogans concerning the congress

all over the city and for placing large signboards along some

of the main parkways.

The possibility was discussed of

persuading a well-known painter, such as Emiliano di Cavalcanti,

to paint a picture for the congress, which would be raffled

off for the benefit of the congress.

1. At a meeting of the SAC on 15 January a series of pro-Cuba

meetings, which would be held before the congress,

planned.

The possibility of inviting certain Brazilian

artists to perform at the meetings in order to attract a

large crowd was discussed. The SAC was also trying to obtain

the signature.of Dias Gomes, the theatrical producer, on the

convocation of the congress.

Gomes planned

to go on

19 January

to Cuba, where he was to direct a play.

"Current Voice of America Programming on Cuba

The Voice of America broadcasts 8 3/4 hours in Spanish dally

to Latin America, of which 2 3/4 hours. 18 tailored especially for

the Cuban audience.

The transmisaion times of the Cuban hours are

6:00 to 7:00 a. II., and 10:00 to 11:45 p.I.

The "Appointment with Cuba" hour (10:00 to 11:00 p.w.) consists

of 15 minutes of news, followed by a five-minute commentary on sone

development in the Cuban situation, a 30-minute Miami-produced package

(interviews with refugees, commentaries refuting the latest Caban

propaganda claims, excerpts of letters received from listeners inside

Cuba), and a ten-minute sports feature emphasizing the activities of

Cuban athletes in the U.S.

The 11:00 to 11:45 p.M. broadcast opens with 15 minutes of news

and is followed either by a half-hour dramatization or a 15-minute

news documentary and 15 minutes of features.

A 150-installment series

of & soap-opera type adventure, featuring three brothers combatting

& Castro-like regime, was run at this time until recently. A new.

series of this dramatization 1s now being produced under contract in

Miami with Cuban writers and actors and will soon be broadcast to Cuba

1n the same time spot.

The 7:00 to 8:00 a.I. broadcast to Cuba also opens with 15 minutes

of world news and repeats the Miami package and features of the previous

night.

In the six hours of daily broadcasts to the general Istin American

the total material relating

This consists

of commentaries, interviews with refugees, and news documentaries.

In addition to the short-wave broadcasts (relayed also to Cuba

on medium wave by two mobile transmitters), the main festures on Cuba

are sent out as tapes to all USIS posts in

Latin America for placement

with some 1500 local radio stations.

The number of listeners reached

by this means is many times greater than the shortwave audience.

The main themes emphasized in the Voice's Cuban programning are:

1) Castro's betrayal of a legitimate national revolution;

2) the sub-

servience of the Cuban regime to international communism; 3) the economio

failures of the regime, relating these to the pattern of communist failures

in the rest of the world; 4) the isolation of Cuba in the face of continental

solidarity opposing Cuba's alliance with the connunist bloo; and 5) the U.s.

position that Cuba will one day be free.

of recruiting and controlling Cuban assistance to the organiza-

tion in the Call area.

The FUAR seems to have been in a recess during recent months in

the Cali area.

In early November Luis Emiro Valencia,

one of.

the leaders of the FUAR, was asked directly 1f there

was any

truth to the story circulating in Cald that Castre had given

him 50,000 dollars to heldElAR.

He laughed and asserted the

amount

mentioned in Bogota is only 30,000.

He said his only

assistance from Cuba was a 1,000-dollar first prize in a literary

contest in 1959 or 1960 and two paid trips thereafter to

judge other literary contests.

It is difficult to determine

the

truth of Valencia's denial or

the charges mentioned herein:

The story has been circulating in Cali for approximately six

months and could be hearsay on the part of either Plata or

Zapata.

It is noteworthy that Valencia has refused to espouse

common

Ideology with the PCC, except for Castro, which Valenci:

insists he will

not

accept if it is a tool of internationa.

All these questions (the 58) had three principal motives:

to know

the

future guerrilla fighter better; and, above all,

his needs and limitations for the struggle; and, generally,

his personal problems

and those of morale.

Time given for

answering

each question was unlimited.

One of the possibilities

is that of introducing arms by

smuggling,

as, for example,

the case or relatives who work on the borders, such as comrades

from Cuzco; also,

in the case of Comrade Betancurt (pseudonym)

who is from

town. of Ayabaca, Plura, and who has facilities

for smuggling arms, since his community borders on Ecuador,

where large-scale

smuggling of arms has developed.

experiences of soldiers;

such as Vallejos, who have served in

such localities, show considerable practice in effecting such

contraband.

1..

Source Comment.

In the question regarding possibilities

of guerrilla warfare, the Cubans

asked about possibilities

of supply by air--suitable drop-zones, etc.

It is possible

that this questionnaire has been filled out by at least

100 Peruvians who have gone to Cuba.

Among

those who have

enlarged on these topics,

the range is from lawyers down

to those who can barely write their names.

Likewise,

from

the interest they are showing in Peru, it

is presumed that

many Cubans

can

introduce themselves into the country,

passing as Mexicans or Panamanians, and set up profitable

businesses

and commercial firms.

One of those who presented

the questions had been in Brazil.

The Cubans took two photos

of those in trainine, front and profile, in militia uniform,

bút without cap.

probably a full-time agent of the Castro government in

charge

of recruiting and controlling Cuban assistance to the organiza-

tion in the Cali area.

The FJAR seems to have been in a recess during recent months in

the Cali area.

In early November

Luis Emiro Valencia, one of

the leaders of the FUAR,

was asked directly if there was any

truth to the story

circulating in Cali that Castro had given

him

50,000 dollars to help FUAR.

He laughed and asserted the

amount mentioned in Bogota 1s only 30,000.

He said his only

assissance from Cuba was a 1,000-dollar first prize in a literary

contest in 1959 or 1960 and two paid trips therearter to

judge other literary.contests.

It is difficult to determine

the truth of valencia's denial or the charges mentioned herein.

The story has been circulating in Cali for approximately six

months and could be hearsay on the part of either Plata or

Lapaia.

it is noteworthy

that Valencia has refused to espouse

common ideology with the PCC, except for Castro, which Valencia

insists he will not accept if it is a tool of international

Communism.
