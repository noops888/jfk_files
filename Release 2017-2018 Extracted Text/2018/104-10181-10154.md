institute of Foreign Languages, where ‘he studied. Spanish and English
dn the Department of Translating. After graduation, KOVALEV left
Minsk. for one year to go.into the Army. However. Source found this
hard to believe, as he knew that KOVALEY had been turned down for :
military service in 1966 because of nearsightedness. During the
time that KOVALEV was in the Army, his wife told Source that where
her husband was serving “they put army boots on once a month, just
for show." KOVALEV's military service card (voyennyy bilet) :
nevertheless indicates both his 1966 rejection and the year that ‘he

supposedly spent in the Army.

1.. Tae druzhing 1s: a. group of civilians who volunteer
to assist the militia in maintaining public order. -Al-though
tne druzni originated spontaneously in about 1962, ‘they

wave Since become official appendages of the militia. There
is at least one druzhina fn eacn factory, ‘public and commercial
enterprise, instrtute ‘and. technical, school. Although the
druzhina officers are supposedly elected, they actually are
appointed by tne administration at.the factory. A duty “roster
ts posted. Almost everyone except the management has to be on
duty at one time or another; no one can refuse, It is very
nard to make people, especially the factory workers; roam the
streets on druzhina duty after a day's work because they would
rather go ‘home. : Ee

2. In the institutes, the druzAiny operate this way.
After lectures all the students of a particular department have
to. attend a compulsory meeting. Tne. senior druzhinnik-of the
institute is in caarge of the meeting, together with the, senior
druzhinnixt and deputies ia the departments. Those students
who for some, reason did not manage to escape this duty (using
a medical excuse, influénce with the chief, or other means),
are then marched to the nearest druzhina post, There are dozens
of such posts’ in-each rayon (precinct) of the militia, usually
in the basements of apartment houses. Usually there is an of fi-
cer of tae militia taere, wit Several militiamen of lower ranks.

suagect Selection and ‘Recruitment: of KGB Officers
SSR ae

Inforsers in the Belorussian

‘DATE OF -INFORMATIO

OATE“OF INTERVIEW

+2, “Sources curiosity about. the selection and. recruitment. of.KGB
personnel was ‘aroused when AKSENOV told him that he was considering
the recruitment-of Source as. a KGB.informant:: -Source ‘asked AKSENOY.
who is selected and for what reasons. VAKSENOV replied that the -KGB
usually usés.spotters, who recommend ‘people for. recruitment. ~Back-
ground is. important. A person froma peasant or worker's family is
considered a ‘better choice. and he mist either be’a quiet and colorless
type who blends into the circle of: people in which he operates, or
else. a conspicuous Voudmouth: who asks embarrass.ing questions.. The
latter would be more likely. suspect of being a-tiember of’ the opposi-
tion rather than a X63 informant... The average informant,: according ~
to AKSENOV, is not very bright because KGB officers themselves aré

not, particularly intelligent and are afraid of anyone who is smarter
than they. Source says: that. he was. never recruited.

3.: Both Source and-AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the
USSR there are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch being
turned down. Far from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful
instrument: and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations
of chis friends..in the name of patriotism will. end up with dismal

career prospects unless he has friends in high places. However, it =r

is unlikely. that such a person would be chosen. for a KGB recruitment
pitch in-the first place. Therefore most of the Tower levels of the
KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are no
other career prospects and who prefer this kind of service to being
in the Army.

4. ‘The KGB officers in the Belorussian SSR aré also those who
are not bright enough to.make a career in some other field, such as.
science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from
the lower-level cadres in that they ‘are the sons ‘cf high-ranking

eae vused ‘by. Source) inva, Safe house.(konspirativnaya’ vartira): Other
: officers.are not supposed to know who these agents are, and this” <*
“Conspiracy”. is a -matter.o eat pride to them. , Source was once
caught teaving the hotel -room'of a Bulgarian ‘girl ‘with whom he had
spent the night, but -he.was released when he gave AKSENOV's’ name to
the junior KGB officer on duty (thereby implying. that Source was on
assignment, for AKSENOV). '

“6. Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming". For example,
a Soviet going abroad on an official assignment cannot refuse. to
cooperate with the KGB. because such refusal would mean that the
person wouldn't be able to travel, .as the KGB has:a say about his
final clearance. Source also gave the example of an applicant for an
unimportant job with the Minsk Symphony who was originally turned
down. © But when..AKSENOV: spoke to the KGB officer responsible for the
Symphony, the applicant was not only hired ‘but received the greatest
respect from the Symphony Director during the entire period of his
employment.

7. The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (otstavniki)
because they-are considered politically reliable and patriotic.
Many otstavniki recruited. by the KGB are former Osobyy otdel (Special
Section, security functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for
them. Such retirees are frequently used in stationary positions,
reporting on or guarding specific areas.

8. Since the KGB relies on spotters for the selection of its
agents, the spotters themselves can get into trouble if they recommend
the “wrong” person.. This means that the spotters are afraid to select
clever people, so insthe end they select mediocre ones. ‘Selection
is determined by the following: If the prospective agent or informer
is a kolkhoznik, he ‘is immediately 502 qualified. If he was in the
Army rticularly ir the Osobyy otdel, this adds another 30%. Other
qualifications are based on the person's being “quiet”, “average”,
or “ordinary”.

revolution. cannot take place, accordir 0
list is the discovery of the illegal possession of a rifled we
such as a rifte-or pistol. This last item-would not be consider
particularly important in. itself; but a KGB officer can :do-very well
for himself if he plays -his cards> right. He must time the discovery
of the illegal weapon with a public. event involving the visit of an
important Party“or. government dignitary.. Thus, in the eyes of his
Superiors, his:discovery is tantamount to thwarting dn assassination
attempt. - Any one of. the. three accomplishments. would: lead: to automatic
‘promotion, a medal, and tenure for life in the KGB.

* 10. PRESENT SITUATION: uZLov, currently lives at 414 Avenue.

We. PERSONAL ‘EVALUATION: UZLOV fs a smart, witty, outgoing,

“aggressive person, accustomed to living by his wits. He 1s

willing to take chances and play roles, but, at the same time,
he is not afraid of hard work, as Tong as it pays well.- He is
somewhat given to romanticizing., for example, by seeking a job
‘invintelligence and not fully realizing that it is a steady
and,often, dull: job.. He is not. persistent, not able to stick
to his studies or hold a job; instead, he prefers to work hard
for shorter periods to earn money, and then do nothing.

UZLOV seemed to be completely won over by the United
States, saying that he is willing to do anything that would be
asked of him, such as his voluntarily bringing in photographs
of somé.of the personalities he described, and suggesting that
he would try to use.the loose code system that he had established
with his friends back in Minsk to obtain information for us,
if-we so require. At the last possible moment, he admitted
that he was incarcerated in the USSR for participation in a
fight, but was later found innocent by.a higher court.

‘ Physically, UZLOV is good-looking, trim, athletic,
and is a formér boxer, who trys. to keep himself in godd shape.
He likes to dress well and, seemingly, no longer drinks to
excess, as he used to do in the Soviet Union.

i 2. In each tourist hotel in Minsk there is a so-calléd

\ militia punkt (unit). It ts usually ina room on-the first floor

: of. the hotel somewhere off the lobby. Supposedly this is.a :
militia unit whose purpose is to. protect foreigners, maintain
order in the hotel, and prevent ‘black-marketing. Actually, this i
unit 4s manned. by KGB representatives in militia uniforms who

carry militia as well as KGB identificatfon, ‘The militia seems

to be the favorite cover for the KGB. ~ -

: 3. In the Yubileynaya Hotel this unit always had four or
five persons on duty. During the day it'had two privates and
a Sergeant in uniform and two officers in. civilian attire. At
night, when on duty, all of them usually wore-militia uniforms.
Aside’ from the above-mentioned militia ‘functions, their actual
mission was-to prevent what they considered to be unnecessary
contact of Soviet citizens: with foreigners, to observe any
suspicious actions by either, and to ensure thet only approved.
persons. had access to. the hotel. ~All other Soviet citizens
would be stopped, their documents checked, and their business
questioned. An officer from such.a unit once stopped Source
after he had spent the night with a Bulgarian girl in the hotel.
Source thinks he was discovered through audio surveillance. vo

would be. used for this purpose. None of ‘these technical: details
were explained either then or later by AKSENOV.

a AKSENOV: never mentioned any phone surveillance and Source
presumed that this is done in a different location, outside
the hotel.

6. In subsequent conversations, AKSENOV told Source that
all rooms occupied by foreigners are listened to by a spot check
from the time that the occupant enters his room, There is apparently
a-device which indicates when this occurs. The running of water
as an audio hindrance is a useless measure, AKSENOV said, as
KGB audio'technicians are able to eliminate this as-well as many
other extraneous noises in order to make the conversations

audible.
