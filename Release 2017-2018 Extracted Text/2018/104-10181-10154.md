MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Selection and Recruitment of KGB Officers, Agents and c

Inforsers,

in the Belorussian

SSR

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-1976

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

26-28 April 1971

source's curfosity about the selection

and recruitment of KGB

personnel

was aroused

when AKSENOV

told him that he was considering

the recruitment of Source as a KGB informant:

Source asked AXSENOV

who is selected and for what reasons.

AKSENOV replied that the KGB

usually

uses spotters, who recommend people for recruitment. Back-

ground is

important

A person from a peasant or worker's family is

considered

a better choice, and he must either be a quiet and colorless

type who blends into the circle of people in which he operates. or

else a conspicuous loudmouth who asks embarrassing questions.

latter would be more likely. suspect of being a member of the opposi-

tion rather than & KGB informant..

The average informant, according

to AKSENOV,

is not very bright because KGB officers

themselves are

not particularly

intelligent

and are

than

they.

Source says that he was never recruited.

afraid of anyone who is smarter

3.:

Both Source and AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the

USSR

there

are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch

turned down.

Far

from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful

instrument, and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations

of his friends in the name of patriotism will end up with dismal

career prospects unless he

has friends in high places.

However. it

is unlikely that such a person would be chosen for

a KGB recruitment

pitch in the first place.

Therefore most of the lower levels of the

KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are

other career prospects and

who prefer this kind of service

in the Army.

4.

The KGB officers in the Belorussian SSRare also those who

are not bright enough

to. make a career

in some other

field, such

science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from

the lower-level cadres in that they are the sons of high-ranking

used by. Source)

in a safe house (konspirativnaya kvartira). Other

officers are

not supposed to know who these agents are. and this

"conspiracy"

is a matter of great pride to them.

Source was once

caught leaving the hotel room of a Bulgarian girl with whom he had

spent the night,

but he was released when he gave AKSENOV's name to

the junior KGB officer on duty (thereby implying that Source was on

assignment

for AKSENOV) •

Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming".

For example,

cooperate with the KGB because such refusal would

mean that the

And if one does, he might well be classifled

as an enemy of the state and end up doing the lowliest physical labor

rather than enjoyinga promising career.

10.

AKSENOV also told Source that the KGB usually opens a file

on a Soviet citizen who corresponds with anyone abroad!

After thiso

hisatelephone conversations are monitored and periodically recorded.

And finally KGB agents and informers who come Into contact wich

him will be asked to

report on him.

11.

Source once asked AKSENOV what the KGB would consider its

greatest accomplishment

AKSENOV replied that the discovery of a

secret agent (nelegal) would be first on the list, followed by the

discovery of an illegal printing press.

Without printed matter. a

revolution cannot take place, according to AKSENOV. Third

on the

list is the discovery of the

illegal possession of a rifled weapon,

such

as a riffe or pistol.

This last item would not be considered

particularly important in itself, but a KGB officer can do very well

for himsalf. if he plays his cards right.

He must time the discovery

of the illegal weapon with a public event involving the visit of an

important. Party or government dignitary.: Thus, in the eyes of his

superiors, his discovery is tantamount to thwarting an assassination

attempt.

Any one of the three accomplishments would lead to automatic

promotion, a medal, and tenure for life in the KGB.
