Records - Status Report

4. (S) CIC is reviewing all soft files using the new

search terms and has found one hit thus far which may have been

reported in an earlier search.

In an undated soft file labeled "NOSENKO Study by

Hart/Commentary" contains NOSENKO's comments on what he knew

about Oswald from his work in the KGB, discussing mainly

Oswald's attempt to commit suicide in

the Soviet Union.

We are currently reviewing the historical soft files for the

terms noted in Ref and will advise if any additonal hits surface.

5. We believe that all of Angleton's files are archived and

maintained by IMS.

In the 1978-79 period, the ban on the

destruction of Angleton's Files, which was imposed by the Church

committee, was lifted, and a number of files were destroyed

pursuant

to the applicable records destruction schedule.

(U) New Search of CI Files for JFK

Assassination Records

(AIUO) Bulletin OIM. EB NO. 02-98.

dated 22 July 1998

1.

(U) The JFK Board has made a number of recent

specific directed requests to assure that the Agency has

complied fully with the requirements of the JEK Act.

Among

these was a request for issuance of the Reference Employee

Bulletin, in which the DCI directed that employees leave "no

stone unturned" in assuring that relevant documents are

provided to the Commiasion.

2. . (U) In part because relevant new documents have

surfaced within the past few months, the Board has also

requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency's

"counterintelligence files." The new documenta have

surfaced

due to a variety of reasons, including references

to assassination related personalities in recent defector

reports, records made available because of the break up of

the Soviet Union, and advanced in search capabilities due to

digitization of older paper files.
