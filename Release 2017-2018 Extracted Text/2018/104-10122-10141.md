SUBJECT: Robert A. Mahou

Mr. Robert A. Maheu was born on 30 October 1917 in
Waterville, Maine. He graduated -fron Holy Cross College in 1949
and is married with four children. He was employed as a
Special Agent with the FBI from 1940 to 1947, and upon re-

“Signing from the Bureau, formed a private enterprise doing

business as “Dairy Dream Products." This venture culminated
in bankruptcy in 1952. He thea re-entered Government service
with the Small Business Adninistration in Washington, D. c.,
and was appointed Special Assistant to the Administrator with
the specific duty of Director of Security. In February of
1954, he was forced to resign from SBA because of political
reasons, determined to be the result of backing the wrong

‘political party in the election, He then set up his own

investigative organization known as Robert A. Mahou Associates,

Mr. Maheu was recruited by the Office of Security in
March of 1954. He was previously known to Mr. Robert H.
Cunningham (deceased) who Was, at that tine, Chief, Special
Security Division, through their mutual employment by the
FBI. Cunninghaa saw in Maheu a covert asset ssho could be
utilized by the Office in extremely sensitive cases. “With
the approval of the Director of Security, Subject was offered
& proposition wherein he was to receive $500.90 per nonth,
with the stipulation that he nove into his own office and
that he be on call for any assignments by the Office of
Security. He agreed to this and immediately took steps to
move out of his area, where he rented desk space in a suite .
occupied by Carmine S, Bellino, a former PBI agent and CPA.

In July of 1954, Maheu was engaged by “British shipping
interests” to check on Aristotle Onassis" activities while
in the United States. This included technical coverags of
Onassis’ New York office. .It was later learaed that the
principal “British interest" was Stavros Niarchus and that
the ultimate goal of this task was to scrap the Onassis/
Saudi oi1 doai. Maheu took the job but conditioned his
Scceptance with the fact that he wovld do nothing inimical
to the U. S. Government. Any information developed of interest
to the United States was to be passed by Mahev to the appro-
priate Government agency.

During this operation Maheu had his staff prepare a
paper citing dangers to U. S. economy and trade resulting
from the Onassis deal. Through contacts in FOA, Maheu
had Harold Stassen read this paper in the National Security
Council on 22 June 1954. During this same period Maheu
briefed Scott McLeod, Assistant Secretary of State for
Security and Consular Affairs on the project. McLeod
agreed to furnish State commo and pouch facilities subject
te Jonn Foster Dulles' approval. Additionally, Maheu
briefed J. Edgar Hoover and Vice President -Nixon.

In August of 1954, Maheu advised this Office of his rela-
tionship with Niarchus. NEA Division was contacted end
expressed interest in this matter. They were put in touch
with Maheu and furnished him a commo channel,-a pouch system
and operational guidance, International litigation erupted
as a result of the Onassis/Niarchus matter, and as a result
of Niarchus claiming Government privilege in the case, the
Agency was subsequently identified as being the Governnent
agency involved. Files of this Office reflect extensive
correspondence furnished us by the Cffice of General Coumsel
in 1956 regarding the Onassis matter.

Cn 16 August 1954 Subject was granted a covert security,
Clearance for utilization as an agent under Project
in the Near East. On 30 August 1954 he was granted @ sin
clearance to permit his use in the United States as a covert

associate under P- HIDDEN. In November of 1957, a
cable fron nn lindicaved that Mr. Maheu had
allegedly been involved in a violation of | i
procuring and transporting prostitutes for

during’ eee, {Yiaie to the United

Mr. Mai s Office to advise that the allegations
were without foundation and stated that he would take steps .

immediately to have his attorney see that appropriate
officials would retract the charges. This was

subsequently done. Edward Bennett Williams acted as Maheu's
lawyer in this matter. :

. ,in 1957 information was received indicating that during
President Sukarno's visit to Moscow in the fall of 1986, he was
introduced to a Soviet woman within the Kremlin. He had
an affair with her against the admonitions of his advisers.

It was reported that the Soviets took detailed films of the
affair and that a copy was sent to the PKI. In June of 1957
Al Ulmer and'Samuei Halpern, FE Division, contacted the



Director of Security and outlined a project. wherein they .
envisioned a film being made simulating this affair. It

was planned that clips from this film would be inserted in

a leaflet for distribution throughout Southeast Asia sug-
gesting that Sukarno was compromised by the Soviets. In

July of 1957, Robert Mahew was given this assignment. He
utilized a trusted male employee of this organization (since
deceased) and -his fiancs. aheu after an intensive make-up
cours?, administered the make-up to the participants himself,
utilizing available pictures and descriptions of the subjects
as a puide. He hired a studio where he was given detailed
jnstruction on the use of the lights and canera2. Waen the z
film was taken, only Maheu and the two perticipaats were in
the studio. The project known as “Happy Days,” was never
completed and the film was not distributed.

period, FE Division was put in touch with Maheu by this

Ostia for assistance in another operztion relating to

and the DCI. :

she had little time to cultivate hin. Consequently, the

In August of 1969, Richard M. Bissell, the then DD/P
contacted the Director of Security regarding the Roselli
matter. Details concerning this are set forth in Attachzent B.

In 1966 information was received by the Agency indicating
that the Senate Administrative Practices Subcommittee, under
the chairmanship of Senator Edward V. Long, had advised Maheu
that his testimony was desired concerning his relationship
with Onassis, Savros Niarchos, Sam Giancana and :

The Subcommittee interest was invasion of privacy and



particularly the use of audio devices by private investigators.
In July of 1366, Senator Long was alerted to the fact that

the Agency had had sensitive operational contacts with Maheu.
Senator Long was told that the Agency had used Maheu over

the years on a number of occasions but that he had never

been asked to engage in any wiretapping and had never

ecagaged in any such activities on our behalf. Office of
Security files do not indicate whether or not Mahen did

appesr before this Subcommittee, although it appears that

he did not.

In January of 1971, in light of the involvement of
Mahev in a suit between executives of the Hughes Company
and Haheu, the Director of Security recommended to the DCE
that all existing clearances with Maheu and Associates be
terminated. The DCI concurred in this recommendation.

Files of this Office reflect that Subject’s company,
Maheu and Associates, cooperated with the Agency in supporting
the activities of an GLOBE agent,
in Ecuador. :

A memorandum from the Chief, Central Cover Staff to
the Inspeator General dated 10 October 1973, delineates the
relationship between CCS and Robert Maheu and Associates,

Information regarding the possibility thar Subject was
dnvelved in a leak of information concerning a sensitive
DD/S§T Special Projects Staff project is set forth in
Attachnont C.

Subject's son Peter Robert Maheu was a staff employes
of the Agency and of this Office from 1963 to 1964. He was
a.clevical employes. In February of 1969, Peter Maheu
was granted a covert security approval as an employee of
Maheu and Associates for use on Project QKENCHANT.

_the mission, Sam suggested that they not resort to firearms
“but that he be. furnished some type of potent pill that could
