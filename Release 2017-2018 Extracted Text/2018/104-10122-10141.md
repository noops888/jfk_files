SUBJECT: Robert A. Mahou

VI. Robert A. Maheu vas born on 30 October 1917 in

Haterville, Maine.

He graduated from Holy Cross College in 1940

and is narried with four children. Ho was employed as ?

Speciel Agent with the FBI from 1940 to 1947, and upon re-

This venture culminated

in bankruptcy in 1952. He then re-entered Government service

with the Small Business Adninistration in Washington, D. C.,

and was appointed Special Assistant to the Administrator with

the specific duty of Director of Security. In February of

1954, he was forced to resign fron SBA because of political

reasons, determined to be the result of backing the wrong

political party in the election. He then set up his own

investigative orgarization known as Robert A. Mahou Associates.

Mr. Maneu was recruited by the Office of Security in

March of 1954. He was previously known to fir. Robert i.

Gunningham (deceased) who sas,

Security Division, through their mutual employment by the

Cunninghan saw in Mahes a covert asset who could be

utilized by the Office in extremely sensitive cases. With

the approval of the Director of security, Subject was offered

a proposition whereia he was to receive $500.00 per month,

with the stipulation that he nove into his own office and

that he be on call for any assignments by the Office of

security.

He agreed to this and innodiately took steps to

nove out of his area, where he rented dest space in a suite

occupied by Carnine S. Bellino, a former PBI agent and CPA.

In July of 1954, Maheu was engaged by 'British shipping

interests" to check on Aristotle Onassis' activities while

in the linited States.

This included technical coverage of

Onassis' New York office. It was later leared that the

principal "British interest" was Stavros Niarchus and that

goal of this task was to scrap the Onassis/

Mahes took the job but conditioned his

acceptance with the fact that he would do nothing ininical

to the l. S. Government. Any information developed of interest

to the United States was to be passed by liaheu to the appro-

priate fovernment azcacy.

During this operation Maheu had his staff prepare a

paper citing dangers to U.S. economy and trade resulting

fron the Onassis deal. Through contacts in FOA, Maheu

had Harold Stassen read this paper in the rational Security

Council on 22 June 1954. During this same perica Maheu

briefed Scott McLeod, Assistant Secretary of State for

Security and Consular Affairs on the project.

to John Foster Dulles' approval. Additionally, Maneu

briefed J. Edgar Hoover and Vice President Nixon.

tionship with Niarchus.

NEA Division was contacted and

expressed interest in this matter. They were put in touco

as a result of the Onassis/Niarchus natter, and as a result

of Niarchus claining Governent privilege in the case, the

Agoncy was subsequently identified as being the Government

agency involved.
