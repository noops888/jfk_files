atTDaTES, March 2, 1955. :
RE: EDWARD BROWDER, JR. : T
with aliases * Al

This investigation is predicated on information
received from T-1, of known reliability who is an official of
the.,.Mexican Ministry of Government (Immigration), to the
effect. that EDWARD BROWDER, Jr, had been arrested by Mexican
ona Agents at Mexico City on November 28, 195).

T-1 advised that in view of the fact that the subject
was in Mexico illegally at the time of his arrest and was
considered to be an undesirable resident, it had been determined
that he would be "informally deported" as soon as arrangements
for his deportation could be effected at a minimum cost to the
Mexican Government. T-1 stated that BROWDER had ‘been offered
the opportunity of paying his own transportation on.any direct
airline flight from Mexico to the United States but that his
efforts to raise funds for such a purpose had not been successful.

T-1 advised that in view of the subject's inability
to secure funds with which to pay his own transportation to the
United States, he had been informally deported in commection
with a group deportation of other United States Nationals. Source
stated that subject was transported to the United States border
by automobile to Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, where his expulsion
to the United States took place to Laredo, Texas, on March 1l,
19556
