Seventh Floor View on JFK Board Extension

I would appreciate your advice on the following:

The Executive Director (David Marwell) of the JFK Assassination Records Review Board called

me to say that he is drafting a letter to Senator Specter proposing a one-year extension for the Board.

The Board's charter expires on 30 September 1997 unless Congress grants an extension. (This was the

subject of a memo, dated 2 January, that I sent to the ADCI via the EXDIR.)

Marwell wants to include in the letter something about ClA's view, or likely view, on the extension.

Is there anyone on the 7th floor who might want to provide a response that I could pass to Marwell ? (In

the absence of a response, Marwell probably will say something like, "the Board has no reason to

believe that CIA would object to an extension."
