Seventh Floor View on JFK Board Extension

| would appreciate your advice on the following:

Rick ¥ cane ze

The Executive Director (David Marwell) of the JFK Assassination Records Review Board called
me to say that he is drafting a letter to Senator Specter proposing a one-year extension for the Board.
The Board's charter expires on 30 September 1997 unless Congress grants an extension. (This was the

subject of a memo, dated 2 January, that | sent to the ADC! via the EXDIR.)

Marwell wants to include in the letter something about CIA's view, or likely view, on the extension.
Is there anyone on the 7th floor who might want to provide a response that | could pass to Marwell ? (in
the absence of a response, Marwell probably will say something like, “the Board has no reason to
believe that CIA would object to an extension."
