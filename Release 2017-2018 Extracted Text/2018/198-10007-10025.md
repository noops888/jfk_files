Memorandum for Record, No.

Subject: Recommendations for training of additional Cuban officers in

exile.

1. Reference is made to:

a: Biographies of Cuban professionad army officers and rebel

army officers in exile, transmitted by memorandum from Miami during the

past

eleven months

recommending they be considered for training in the

U.S.

service establishments.

b. Informal discussions on this subject:

(1) By Dr. Miro Cardona with DOD and Department of State re-

presentatives.

Department

(2) By Dr. Miro's U.S. contact in conversation with DOD and

of State representatives.

(3) Between DOD representatives and Dr. Miro, Dr. Varona

and Capt. Despaigne on 14 October, 1962, in Hotel Carillon, Miami Beach.

C. Current program for training Cuban Army and Air Force offi-

(total of 8 Army and 4 Air Force)•

d: Recruiting program for Cuban exiles.

2. The recommendations in this memorandum take into consideration:

a. That only a limited number of Cuban exile officers can readi

ly be trained in the established courses in U.S. service schools due to

the length of these courses, the lack of vacancies in each class, and

the language problem for most cubans, and other factors.

b. That it would seem desirable to train a considerable number"

of Cuban officers in a relatively

short period of time in the immediate

future.

c. That it would be desirable to have Cuban officers receive

training similar to that

given to Cuban enlistees in the current program

for training Cubans in their own units and using the Spanish language.

d. That it would be advantageous to have Cuban officers in exile

become directly

associated with Cuban enlistees in the U.S. Army train-

ing program for cubans; so that this association may continue after ter-

mination of the 20- week training program and estab.ishment or a Cuban

Reserve Unit (or Cuban Expeditionary Force).

e. In addition to this training for the majority of available

and qualified Cuban exile officers, training in counter-insurgency oper-

ations appears desirable for four

or five specially selected officers.

deena gunnery ana navization traming for Air Tonce officers also 18

desirable.

Of less importance but deserving of consideration

is training for the relatively small number of Cuban navy officers in

exile.

Training for medical officers has also been proposed by Dr. Miro

and his medical advisors.

3. It is understood that during the 14 October meeting at Miami

the possibility was explored

officer instructors of the Cuban enlistee training program,

and using

Cub an

"Rebel Army" and "Liberation Army" officers as "cadre" in the

training program for Cuban enlisted men. In view of these exploratory

proposals which were conveyed to me by Dr. Miro, I discussed the matter

some length with him as I interpreted the general idea, and convinced

him and his military assistant, Capt Despaigne, of the mary advantages

to be gained if such a program could be worked

out. I requested

Capt. Despaigne to prepare a list and biographic data of the available

protessional ollicers and Rebel Army officers under 43 years of age

deemed to be qualified for this rather arduous training. These have

been furnished to me and are attached hereto as appendices.

It is to

be assumed that twenty to twenty-five per cent of these officers would

be unable to undertake training due to physical disqualification or

personal recommendations as to the officers whom he considers should be

given counter-insurgency training in Panama if this can be arranged.

informed him that this type of training is such that it would be suita-

ble for those officers who might be given responsibilities at a later

date for counter-intelligence and counter-espionage and counter-insurgen-

cy duties in Cuba and who, in turn, would be able to train other person-

nel in such duties.

• In view of the observations and discussions mentioned above,

the following recommendations are submitted for consideration:

a. That at least four (4) and not more than six (6) of the fol-

Lowing named orticers be provided with invitational orders for training

his recommendation, that one or two of the officers selected be "Rebel

Army" officers and

the others be professional army officers).

sent to the jungle Warfare course in Panama at an early date. Officers

trained in "Liberation Army" also suitable (List C) •

c. That the other officers on attached List A (professional army

officers),

if physically and mentally qualified, be brought into the 20-

week training program for Cuban exiles at the earliest possible date as

"civilian advisors" to U.S. instructor personnel, or in such other capa-

city as may be deemed advisable.

d. That the other officers on Lists B and C ("Rebel" and "Li-

beration Army")

if physically and

capa free ay be and ay alone date as oare, or in suen ora

, or in such other

e. That these officers participate in the same training as the

enlisted personnel, but with appropriate status being given to them;

subsequently, it may be found desirable to send

selected individuals to

officers' candidate courses for further training.

5. Consideration must be given to the need for allowances for the

dependents of officers taking the training and for their own uniforms

and living expenses.

If these factors present a difficult problem, a

Possible solution would be to have these men enlist for the twenty.-

week training program with provisions for the special status indicated

above, eligibility for dependent allowances

and possibly promotions to

N CO grades in order to draw higher pay.

If they received the same al-

lowances for dependents, as is accorded U.s. personnel, they would be

as well off, financially, as they are now (or better in some instances) .

6. Such a solution has been discussed with Dr. Miro and Col. Jose

Monteagudo, presently representing the

"Military Sector" in the Cuban

Revolutionary Council and serving as military adviser to Dr. Miro.

They recognize the advantages of training the officers much the same as

the enlisted Cubans.

however, they comment that for career (profession"

al) officers it would tend to

conflict with their honor, dignity and past

training. But since they desire preparation to help liberate Cuba,

Sol. Monteagudo (and Dr: Miro concurs) feels that most of the officers

would agree to enlist and go through the twenty-week program if it were

arranged along the following lines:

a That all professional olficers enlist and be inducted on the

same day (as a special group);

b. That they be sent to the training camp on the same day (as a

special group); and

c. That they be trained as a separate unit apart. from the re-

cruits, with befitting preferred conditions.

d. That those qualified be subsequently sent to officers candi-

date or officers' training course.

Para. 6 cont.

e. That in accordance with their demonstrated abilities they

ultimately be

assigned

as officers or advisers to the Cuban units.

7: DI. Miro and Col. Monteagudo also recommend that if such a

procedure is adopted for

the professional officers, a like procedure

be adopted for the "Rebel Army"

and "Liberation Aruy" officers; i.e.

that they enlist as a group and be sent to camp as a group and there

be trained as

separate unit with appropriate special conditions.

These officers would be less sensitive about their status and would be

more inclined to accept such a procedure which might offend the career

army officers.

8. Unfortunately most of the officers of all categories are older

and would be ineligi-

officers are in

the 18 - 26 bracket.

9 "liberation" are 35 or under.

and 4 "liberation" are 36 to 42.

There are at least 15 to 20 officers

in exile over 42, whose names are not included in the attached lists and

biographies but may be among biographies transmitted previously to

Washington.

9. If Cuban officers are included in the current training program

for Cuban enlisted men in ary advisory, cadre or enlisted status, it

Is suggested that recommendations be made by the U.s. instructor

person-

nel as to their fitness for continuing with appropriate assignments in

the Cuban Reserve unit, formed that the officers who are qualified be as-

a Cuban Reserve is

and that when the training period is completed

signed appropriate positions in that unit.

10. There are many Cuban physicians in the U.S. and mary in the

Miami

area.

Many have been going to school in the U.s., qualilying

themselves to practice here.

Many would welcome an opportunity to train

and to serve as physicians with the Cubans who are being recruited for

this special program.

They are anxious to learn medical field work and

also to study and train for health and sanitation work when Cuba is li-

berated.

It is suggested that 10 or 15 Cuban exile doctors who volun

teer be brought into the Cuban training program on a contract basis.

I1. There are approximately as many Cuban Air Force officers in

exile as Army officers and as many civilian pilots as there are "Rebel

Army" officers, approximately 50 of each. Their biographies have been

transmitted to

the Defense Department.

In the current program for train-

there are only 4 Air Force officers included in the

will receive rather high level training.

U.S. enough Cuban pilots and Air Force officers for several Cuban squad-

sh level trainin orriers.

There are available in the

rons

and it appears desirable, therefore, to give them flight training,

tactics, gunnery, navigation, maintenence and other types of training.

12. It is reported that thirty to forty Cuban Navy officers are in

exile.

The biographies of about half of them have been transmitted to

1N 50955 Doc1d:32424018 Page 11

Para. 12 cont.

Washington. For those who are qualified, it would seem desirable to

provide training with small craft and weapons and related matters.

13. The training of Cuban Army officers appears to be the most

important and also the most easily arranged, as

compared to the train-

ing of Air and Navy personnel.

Accordingly,

it is recommended that the

trainine of Cuban "professional" at the earllest possible date with

"Rebel Arny" and "Liberation Army"

officers be given consideration

view to their entering upon training in the immediate future.

trothing progron for Cuban entisted men.

In viow of these exploratory

proposals

which more conveyed to me by Di, Miro, I discussed the matter

ength vith him as I interpreted the general iea, and convincue

him and his military assistant, Capt Despaigne, uf the wary advintages

to be gained if such a program could be worked

out. I requested

Capt. Despaigne to prepare i list and biographic data of the avui able

professical officers and Rebel Arny officers under 43 years of age

deemed to be qualified for this rather arduous training, These have

boen furnished tu die

ant are attached hereto as appendices.

It is to

bo assumed that twenty to twenty-five per cent of these officers would

be unable ti undertake trainiug ue to physical disque ification or

personal reasons.

In additin to these lists, Di, Miro has given me

personal recommendatins as to the officers whom he considers should be

given counter-insurgency training in Panana if this cun be arranged.

informed him that this type of training is such that it would be suita

ble for those officers who might be given responsibi ities at & later

liate for countermintel.igence an. counter-espionage and counter-insurgen

cy uties in Cuba and who, in turn, would be able tu train other person-

nel in such cuties.

4. In vict of the observations und discussions lentined above,

the following recommendations are subnitted for

consideratiin:

a. That at least four (4)

and not more than six (6) of the fol-

Loving

noned officers be provided with invitationas orders for training

at the corlest possible time

in the counter-insurgengy operit.ong

course uf 10 weeks curatin given in Pinana to Latin Americon officers

and governuent representetives: (Dr. Miro recumiends ind I concur in

his recourencution, that one or two

of the officers selected be "Rebel

Arny" officers ar: the others be professinal amy officers).

Montoazudo (and Dr Miro concurs) feels that host of the officers

That in accordance with toeir demonstrated abi ities they

ultimately be assigned as officers or advisers to the cubon units.

7. Di. Miro an! Col. Monteagudo also recomend that if such &

procature is adopted for

the professionel officers,

a Like procedure

be adopted for the "Rebel Aruy" and

"Liberatin Ari" officers; 1.0.

that they an ist as a group uni be sent to cunp as a group anu

be trained as

a separate unit with appropriate special conditiuns.

These officers would be less sensitive about their status and rould be

more inelined

to accept such & procedure which night offend the career

army officers.

8. Unfortunately nost of the officers of all categories are older

and vould be ineligi-

the 18 - 26 bracket.

Nineteen professional officers, 32 "rebel" and

9 Minberationt are

35 or under

Iwenty-four professional, & Brebeli

are 36 to 42, There are at least 15 to 20 officers

in exile over 48y

whose nives are not Inoluded in the attached 1ists and

biographies but nay be among biographas trunsmitted previously to

Washington,

9. If Cubun fficers are included in the current training program

for Cuban enlisted men in any advisory, cadre or enlisted status, it

is suggested that recommendati.ns be made by the U.S. instructor

as to theis titaess tos entrume with apropriate ascienante in

*the Cuban Reserve units

and that when the trilning period is completed

and a Cuban Reserve 15

formed that the officons who are quaiified be as

signed appropriate

positions in that unit.

10. There are many Cuban physicians in the U.S, an. many in the

Maond area.

Many have beer going to school in the u.s.y

chenselves to practice here.

Nony ould welcone an opportunity to train

also to study

and train for healtb and sanitation work when Cube is 11-

berated.

It is suggested that 10 or 15 Cuban exile doctors who volun

teer be brought into the Cuban training progran on & coutract basis.

11. There are aproximately as mady Cuban Air Force officers in

exiie as Arny officers and as many civician pilots as there are "Rebel

Army" officers,

approxinately 50 of each.

Their biographies have been

trans.itted to

the Defense Department.

In the current program for train-

there are only 4 Air Force Officers Inoluded in the

18. It is reported that thirty to forty Cuban Navy officers are in
