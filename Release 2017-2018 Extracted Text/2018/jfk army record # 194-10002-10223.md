SUBJECT: Dossiers on SD-18872, SD-6653

and SD-19056

We are returning the attached dossiers. As you know,

CAS, Miami, told us on 25 November they want to re-

establish contact with Junco, SD-18872. This we are

obliged to do as he is their source. I believe they

will fail to establish a working relationship with nim,

but unless you people can persuade them to give up their

interest, we are stymied. I suggest that we keep OI on

SD-6653 and SD-19056, as they will enable us to perhaps

use them and our OI as levers for further negotiation

if CAS fails again.

CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO

DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR
