On 5/3/61, PETER BOMBIK, 1520 Lincoln Ave., New Kensington,
Pa. (protect per request), advised SA THOMAS G; FORSYTH, III:

The MANNARINOs have purchased some new property near Camp
Jo-An, Pa., in Westmoreland County, A New Kensington, Pa,.,
“peal estate agent, A. F. BOYER, handled the transaction.

On 5/3/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH:

As yet, KELLY MANNARINO has not installed a telephone at his
cottage near Leechburg, Pa., When he wishes to make a

telephone call, he goes down Old Leechburg Road about a

- quarter of a mile to a Meadow Gold Dairy farm and uses a coin
telephone. It is believed, however, that when MANNARINO F
commences permanent summer residence at the cottage, which f

is imminent, he will want a telephone installed on the d Bf
premises,

Pittsburgh will remain in contact with the local telephone

company official who can advise when a telephone application
is made by MANNARINO.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
