1964 and to Abidian and the Tusnkin Street drop (key factor
in the PEMKOVSKIY corprorise). Subject becare very upset
at questicning on this subject and refused to discuss his

3. There still remain several areas of interest and
importance to be covered with the techniques used to date.
We expect to complete this line of questioning by 28 Octoder.

analyses of key asrects of this case. “ere imvortant is
the fact that NOSFNEO knows he is reacting in sensitive

KCB will get hir out. Related te this rav be the thoucht
that the EGR has CIA so deeply nenetrated that it would be

us in a different and stroncer posture. Therefore, wo now
plan to go beyond the limited aims originully set for this
phase of the interrogation. We plan to continue the inter-
rogation in the hope of getting a confession; written vlans

24 October 1966

1. This is an interim report on progress to date in
the new phase in the interrogation of HCSENKO, which began
on 18 October 1966, and covers the first four days, 18-21
October. After a break, it will resume on 25 October.

2. Our aims in thia phase of the interrogation have
been limiteds in view of the possibility of losing accesa
to NOSENKO, we have sought (a) to strengthen our basic report,
now in preparation, by testing his story further, clarifying
points of confusion and revealing new contradictions, and
by polygraph exaninations of key areas, and (b) to lead
toward his eventual confession by directly exploiting our
hypotheses about the true background of NOSENKO and this
KG3 operation, to convey to NOSENKC the impression that we
kno# more than before, that we possess irrefutable proof
of his cuilt and that he has no prospects for release, We
refrained from doing this in earlier phases of the interro-
gation, but at this point there seems little to lose.

3. The first four days have show that the method is
useful, NOSENKO again proved a cood reactor on polygraph,
he seemed disturbed by our knowledge and the special areas
of interest we revealed, and we were able to develop im-
portant new information, contradictions and indications
concerning the background of this operation,

Method

4.. Our basic spproach has Leen to question HOSENKO in
specific.terms cn selected end detailed aspects-of the story
he has told to date. We gave him no explanation for our
renedal of the interrogation, nor has he asked for any. Our
questions have been pointed and detailed and neither require
nor permit long-winded answers; they do not seek new infor-
mation but are clearly designed to check information he pro-
vided earlier; our questions are slanted to build up the
impression that they are based on data we have learned in-
dependently. The subject matter is teken up in a preceter-
mined order designed for maximum impact on NOSENKO, Inter-
rogation sessions are followed by polygraph examinations on
the matters covered in the daterrogation and/or other topics.
Somewhat more time is spent on direct polygraph examination
than on interrogation,

Highlights to Date

5. OSWALD Cases The opening session was a polygraph
examination conducted by Nicholas Stoiaken, whom NOSENKO
recognized as his earlier polygraph operator. The question-
ing was devcted entirely to Lee Harvey OSWALD and NOSENKO's
role in the OSWALD case. we hit this point before any other
in order (a), to permit clean polyoraph testing on this key
matter without having disturbed him with other questions,
and (b), to get over to NOSENKO the cravity of our concern
on this matter of highest state interest. The operator's
conclusions weres

ea. Subject was not personally or actually in-
volved in the OSWALD case from 1959 while OSAALD was
in the Soviet Union,

b. Subject received special instructions (from
the KGB) about the OSWALD case and what to tell An-
erican euthorities sbout it.

ce. Subject's allegec association with the OS#ALD
case both “before and after" the Kennedy assassination
was partly for the purpose cf supporting end sub-
stantiating Subject’s cover story “legend".

a, Subject heard of OSWALD (as a case) only after
Kennedy's assassination, howaver he was not an active
participant in 1963 as he indicates, but was probably
briefed on the case ky a KGB officer.

6. neva Meetings: We devoted several hours of inter-
rogation and polycraph testing to the Geneva periods, June
1962 and January-February 1964, we hit this point second in
order because there are clear signs of important deception
behind it and it offers us special opportunities to sugceat
inside information #hich in fact derive from observation and
deduction, Among the hich points were the followings

@. Pavel SHAKHCVs NOSENKO's story of his “investi-
gation" of SHAKHOV, a Soviet delegation member whom he
said was suspected 1n 1962 to be an American agent, was
covered again in detail. ‘The new data we obtained tend
to confirm that this is a serious part of NOSENKO's

SHAKHOV''s. background in fact suggests that
he ig_actually a KGB officers his contact in Geneva
with [Devid MARK, a former CIA cooptee in Hoscos is 06,08
et the center of NOSENKO's story. we slanted our
questions to suggest knowledge that SiAXHOV is a KGB
officer (not a KGB investigation suspect) and that
we may know of some of his important operational
ccentacts. NOSEXKO was inconsistent in his story

and reacted significantly under polygraph examina-
tion. we are currently tracing new nemes and data
wri are re-examining the sicnificance of this matter.

b. K&B Control in Genevat NOSENKO reacted very
strongly and consistently to the question of whether
or not he had been sent to Geneva by the KGB to con-
tact CIA, whether he was receiving KGB direction
there, and on related questions, including some re-
lated to his ostensible investigation of Pevel SHAKHOV.

¢. U.S, Personnel and Installations in Geneyar
HOSENKO was interrogated on his earlier story that

he had seen in Geneva in 1964 the file on KGB activity
against American installations in Geneva (KGB eryptonym
*SKOXPICH"), His version this time conflicted with
his 1964 version but contained the same message, that
the weak and understaffed KGB in Geneva had little
interest, limited fecilities and no success in opera-
tions against the Americans and had practically no
idea of the identities of CIA personnel there. In
addition, NOSENKO reacted to polygraph questions
related to whether the KGB had told him the name of
his CIA case officers. On the other hand, he did not
react to the names of the then COS Switzerland and

OB Geneva, which suggests that he was not told them
(these names were buried in lists of names).

d. KGB Personnel in Genevat NOSENKO's answers
to questions concerning Alexandr KISLOV conflicted
with certain details earlier reported, including KIS-

LoV's role in the{ARCHITCHAT case. He seemed disturbed 02

by the questioning "én KISLOV and finally said he saw

no reason to answer any more of them. However, his
polygraph reactions did not suggest that he was as
sensitive to KISLOV as to other individuals and matters
covered in the same series of questions. We also asked,
with the polygraph, whether he was withholding anything

concerning his alleced agent Gleg GRINEVSAIY, an
official of the Soviet delegation; his reactions py
suggested that he may cenuinely be ignorant of
GRINEVSKIY's KGB activitie

at the tine. He earlier
said thet his daily access to the KGB Residency in
Geneva in 1364 was due to his frequent contacts «ith
Mikhail S. TSYMBALy this tine he said that he only
Sad TSYMBAL twice in Geneva in 1964 end failed to
mention a Sunday meeting with TSYMBAL which he hed
reported to us at the time it cccurred. This leaves
open the whole question of how NOSiKO can explain
his daily access to the Residency, which he himself
no@ says = evidently on the basis of what he has
learned from our previous interrogations - is not
normally pemaitted. This will be covered in further
questioning.

7.Matters kel, Oo the PEIKCVSKIY Compromise

a. John ABIDIAN'? Visit to the Pushkin Street
Deaddropt NOSENKO reacted witn special sensitivity
and intensity when asked in a polygraph test whether
he had been instructed to tell CIA about ABIDINI's
wisit to the Pushkin Street deaddrop. In addition,
he refused for the first time to discuss his om
participation in the incident, adamantly claiming
that he does not remember when or even whether he
visited the drop or whather he read-reports on
surveillance coverace of it after ABIDIAN's visit.
(He had earlier said he visited the drop at least
twice, immediately after ABIDIAI's visit; he des-
eribed the location. and named the KGS officers.he
went with.) In sharp contrast to his reluctence
to discuss his personal role wes hic unhesitating
and confident response to other aspects of the
Pushkin Street drop story# he reiterates that
ABIDIAN was under full time, double-strength sur-
veillence throughout his tour in Moscow and that
RBIDIAN was surveilled to the drop. He now adds,
for the first time, that the KGS concluded that the
@rop had been initially found by a U.S. tourist or
Gelegation member and that ABIDIAN was merely check-
ing out its suitability for sone eventual use. (In
fact, PENKOVSKIY proposed the drop and ABIDIAN went
there only in response to the agreed telephonic
ah triggered by persons unknown, not by PENKOV-
SKIY.

be NOSEVKO was again queried on

Ob Go}onel DULAGKINS bugged restaurant meeting with
en officer, whose neme he gave as

ob in 3362 and ain 19€4. He could not clarffy
why he had confused the names. Since we now know
through Greville WYNNE that the Soviets were inter-
ested as late as early 1363 in clarifying PENKOV-
SkI¥'s allusion in a hucged conversation in 1961

0b to wa believe that NOSENKO's 1962 version
was @ KGW’ fishing expedition. However, NOSENKO
did not to a polycraph questicn concerning

O06 the nane and he may not himself know that
he was given @ wrong nane for the officer,
nor why.

c. 2amiral VORONTSOVs: It hed been speculated
that when NOSENKO menticned in June 1962 mectings
the name of his “big friend“ in the naval GRU,
Aémiral VORONTSOV, he may have been fishing for
comsents from us concerning Marshal VARENTSOV,
PENKOVSKIY's protector. Cueried this time about
Admiral VORONTSOV, NOSENKO said that ha had never
met him and had no personal or similar connection?
he seens to have completely forcotten ever having
clained a Repsonal relationsnip.

this. We then added to his concern by “gelling him (untruth-
fully, but with _a reasonable estimate of the true situation)

o bthat{PREISrAUzID elso' said that the KCB had told him to gay
he first met NOS’ 4n 1960. when polycraphed NOSENKO re-
acted stroncly and consistently to questions on the subject.
These reactions and our follow-up may well bear on the ques-

obtion of whethor [STORSBERG]was actually recruited by the KGB,
an issue we nave reviewed with the FBI. NOSENKO must be
concerned because he now seys that the @TORSBERG|easze was Si
primarily GRYNAZOV's, not his ow, although he, NOSENKO,

- supervised" it. Thus disappears the sole case that NOSENKO
has claimed as his very own.

9. Identity and Personal Backgrounds: One of the basic
questions underlying this cperation is NOSENKO's real identity.
and personal background, There are many indications, reported

earlior, that he has spent tine in prison and that he is
not in fact a KGB officer; similarly, his stories of his
early school end military service ore inconsistent and
unbelievable. We are trying in this interrogation to
clarify this important point. Among the points covered
so far are the followings

oe

a. Identity: NCSENKO was questioned extensively
on the polygraph concerning his ide:tity. In one
series of tests, for exeuple, he was asked whether.
Minister of Shipbuilding Ivan NOSENKO was the father
of Yuri Ivanovich NOSE‘KO and was then asked whether
Hinister NOSENKO was. his father; similarly with
Tamara WOSLAKO, his ostensible mother. NCSENKO did
not react to the question phrased “Yuri Ivanovich
NOSENKO", but reacted consistently when esked if
these were his owm parents. He was sensitive to
questions concerning h‘s marriage. (Tnere is reason
to believe he is not, in fact, married.) He was also
given a series of tests asking for the first letter
of his civen nama. The whole alphabet was covered,
and the polygraph charts show that he beceme increas-
ingly tense, culminating at the letter 5 (or perhaps
T) on both runs. ‘hile we recognize that testing of
this sort may not give valid results, it cortainly
gets over to NOSEWKO the decree of our doubt and may
even help us determine who he really is. We will
pursue this further, covering his patronym and family
name as well.

b. Homosexuality: We tested polygraphically our
observations that NOSENKO has homosexual tendencies
and experience, He showed himself extremely sensitive
to this line of questioning. The test results tend
to show that he had homosexual experience in Scviet
imprisonment (see below) and with the KGB homosexual
agents whom he has told us he recruited and handled.

c. Impcisonments: In view of the strong indica-
tions that NOSENKO has spent considerable time in
prison (as reported in the past), we questioned him
on this. He reacted strongly and consistently to the
question of whether he had been imprisoned in the USSR.
Wea then ran a series of tests to determine his relative
sensitivity to various types of imprisonment, various
crimes for which he may have been imprisoned, various
areas of the USSR where he may have been imprisoned,

and various years. of imprisonment. He seemed con=
sistently sensitive to correctional labor camps

as the type of prison, and to several possible
causes of imprisonment: particularly homosexuality,
desertion and felony. Interestingly enough he was
not sensitive te questions concerning imprisonment
for self-inflicted wounds despite his story that he
had shot himself in the hand during the war. He
seened more consistently sensitive to Siberia as

the area of imprisonment but the results were not

as clear as on other aspects of his story. He seems
particularly sensitive to the years 1954-1936, which
immediately preceed the period from 1956 onward,
when he began to appear in KGS operations.
