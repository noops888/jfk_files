toward his eventual confession by directly exploiting our

Geneva Meetings:

We devoted several hours of inter-

rogation and polygraph testing to the Geneva periods, June

1962 and January-February 1964.

We hit this point second in

or not he had been sent to Geneva by the KGB to con-

tact CIA, whether he was receiving KGB direction

there, and on related questions, including some re-

lated to his ostensible investigation of Pevol SHAKHOV®

U.S, Personnel and Installations in Geneva:

NOSENKO was Interrogated on his earlier story that

he had seen in Geneva in 1964 the file on KGB actlilty

against American installations in Geneva (KGB cryptonym

"SKO:PICH") •

His version this time conflicted with

his 1964 version but contained the same message. that

the weal and understaffed KGB in Geneva had little

limited facilities and no success in opera

tions against the Anericans and had practically no

1dea of the identities of CIA personnel there. In

addition, Nostiko reacted to polygraph questions

related to whether the KGB had told him the name of

his CIA case officers.

On the other hand, he did not

react to the names of

the then COS Suitzerland and

COB Geneva, which

suggests that he was not told them

(these names were buried in lists of names) .

to questions concerning Alexandr KISLOV conflicted

with certain details earlier reported, Including KIS

LoV's role in the lAECHITCHAT case.

He seemed disturbed 02

by the qestioning on KISLOV and finally said he saw

no reason to answer any more of them.

However, hig

polygraph reactions did not suggest that he was as

sensitive to KISLOV

as to other individuals and matters

covered in the same serles of questions.

We also asked,

and intensity when asked in a polygraph test whether

visit to the Pushkin Street deaddrop.

In addition,

he refused for the first time to discuss his own
