OGC 77-0427
19 January 1977
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM: Edmund Cohen
Assistant General Counsel

SUBJECT: -- Involvement as Witness in
“Gerald Parrick Hemming Case

1. In the late afternoon on 7 January 1977, Mr
informed the undersigned that he was being asked to ereerca—e—procoser
conference on 10 January in Miami, Florida, and expected to be a witness

jovernment in the case against Gerald Patrick Hemming. Mr.
fe Tne that he had been under cover while employed by the Agency
to 1974. He ansferred to DEA where he became involved
with Mr. Hemming. uy fie now back with the Agency and expected
to be put under cover very Shortly. Both for cover considerations and
because he felt the Hemming case had a great deal of "flap" potential,

rivaling the Werbell case, he desired OGC to intercede for him to keep him
from having to testify.

2. ve [feted that Hemming was a "walk-in", who was referred
to his boss at > Mr. Conein, by Mr. Werbell and that Conein, in turn,
had sent Hemming to him to be interviewed. Subsequently, Mr. Hemming
had "set up" Mr. Conein by first telling him that a brother wished to work
with DEA and requesting permission to give Mr. Conein a resume, and later
by publicly meeting Conein and handing him a manila envelope ostensibly
containing the promised resume. In fact, the envelope contained a report
with phony cryptonyms representing Hemming as an agent of Conein's.
Hemming's report detailed a variety of alleged official activities an
mentioned his prior contacts with Conein and witl
that Hemming would undoubtedly try to beat the
against him in Miami by claiming to be a DEA or CIA agent?.
testimony that he was a DEA employee when he met him but was a
employee both before and after would help cloud the issue. In addition,
such exposure could affec current usefulness to the Agency.

3. Thg undersigned checked with Mr. Robert Blandford, CCS, and
learned thal paver had been removed when he left the Agency, thus
his previout was _a.matter of public record. In addition, he was not

now under cover. Mr \C/CCS, opined that no cover problem
existed which would impede| \ |testimony.

4, The undersigned then spoke with Ms. Karen Atkinson, Assistant
U.S. Attorney in Miami (305) 350-5461, to inform her of M2’. urrent
sta Atkinson appreciated the potential problems, but concluded that
sep fest be a necessary witness for the trial which was scheduled
to 1 January. The question of travel expenses was also broached.
Ms. Atkinson stated that she did not have an expense fund to pay the travel
expenses of Government witnesses and that the usual practice was for the
employer Agency to pay the expenses of an employee testifying on behalf of
the Government about his official actions. The instant case was somewhat
unusual because CIA would be paying for et ee in effect, testify
about his DEA experiences, but she opined thi Ss a matter best
resolved in Washington.

5. In view of the limited time available, the undersigned informed Mr.
[set chief j\ \ |of the above and suggested that travel

cut for Mrf\ to Miami.

az

6. On ll January, following his return from Miami, Mr
informed the undersigned that Hemming's motion that his trial be severe
from that of his various co-conspirators had been granted and, therefore,
his testimony had not been required. Ms. Atkinson had informed him that

emming raise as a defense the allegation that he was a DEA agent,
ieee be called as a rebuttal witness. Ms. Atkinson also noted
that Hemming was alleging that DEA was representing him at the behest
of CIA because in the past he had "crossed" CIA.
