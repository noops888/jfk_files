About two weeks ago another Staffer named "Millie" who works in

Training and is a friend of TARASOFF received a letter from him in which

TARASOFF enclosed a photo of someone who he asked Millie to help identify®

Millie said she thought the individual in the photo looked like Valerie

Kostikoff (phonetic), a Soviet Intel Officer. Millie wrote back to

TARASOFF and advised him of same.

P-S. I don't know what this all adds up to.. Mr. Breckinridge was

primarily interested in finding out who the transcriber was. He said

the transcriber reported that whoever it was on the phone talking to

the Soviet Embassy spoke very poor Russian.••
