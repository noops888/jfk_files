INFO

02

Mrs.

of TSD just told me

in the course of a visit that Herman

E. KIMSEY of BEYISION fame,

a former TSD nick called her on

the phone and tried to get her to

have lunch with him, so he could

get her to analyse the handwriting

of some homosexuals who were

the "real murders of Martin Luther

King". KIMSEY gives out that he

is working to exonerate RAY for

this peccadillo..

said she avoided contact Â°)

and will report this to MIL

TSD Security Officer. (previously

she told

but he told

her to forget it and evade KIMSEY.

I suggested she better tell

as KIMSEY is capable of any action

involving her or the Agency.)

03

KIMSEY also told Mrs.

thathis

side-kick & Cleve BAKSTER has found

a way to use a lie detector on plants

even to detect people who murder

other plants in the presence of a

plant that serves as a witness....

Nothing succeeds like excess....
