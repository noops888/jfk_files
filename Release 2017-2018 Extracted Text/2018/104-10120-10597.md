INFO

Mrs, be TSD just told me
in the course of a_visit that Herman
E, KIMSEY of BEYISION fame,

a former TSDSnick called her on
the phone and tried to get her to
have lunch with him, so he could
get her to analyse the handwriting
of some homosexuals who were

the real murders of Martin Luther
King". KIMSEY gives out that he
is working to exonerate RAY for
this peccadillo.

eee she avoided contact °} |

and will report this to gaa
TSD Security Officer.0> (previously
she tol but he told
her to forget it and evace KIMSE ¥.
I suggested she better i aa

as KIMSEY is capable of any action
involving her or the Agency.)

KIMSEY also told Mrs, this
side-kick 8 Cleve BAK has foun
a way to use'a lie detector on plants
even to detect people who murder
other plants in the presence ofa

plant that serves as a witess....
Nothing succeeds like excess....
