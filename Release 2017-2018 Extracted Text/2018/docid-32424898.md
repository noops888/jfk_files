2. A maritime propaganda balloon launching capability and

appropriate policy authority to conduct propaganda balloon launching

operations.

3. Policy approval and authorization to conduct aircraft leaflet

dropping operations using U.S. and other contract crews.

4. Intrusion on live Cuban TV channels with video and audio

transmissions from airborne and seaborne platforms. Policy approval

is required.

5.

Continuation and, expansion of the "Voice of Cuba" submarine

broadcasting operations in collaboration with the Navy.

6. Continue and expand the present propaganda operations

infiltrating material into Cuba via the open mails, legal travelers,

or couriers.

7. Intensify propaganda activities utilizing political, professional,

cultural, student, and other groups which have a potential for getting

their message to their counterparts inside of Cuba.

C. Paramilitary:

To date, the paramilitary program against Cuba has been limited.

Experience plus continually tightening security controls has

demonstrated the difficulty of infiltrating and maintaining "black

teams"' in the target country for an indefinite period, nor has any

method yet been devised by which infiltrated "black teams" can be

effectively legalized with adequate documentation. Therefore, the

PM program must increasingly emphasize team infiltrations, spotting,

recruiting, and training legal residents, caching and exfiltration of the

original teams. This must be paralleled by an aggressive psychological

warfare program which will maintain the will to resist and revolt and

will provide "the spark of hope." Without this, it will be impossible

to recruit and train the necessary legal residents.

To accomplish the required tasks, the following program and

support is considered essential:

1. Commando/Raider Teams - Ten to fifteen such teams of

approximately twelve men each should be available for unilateral

caching operations, selected major sabotage operations, and hit and

run commando raids. Authority should be granted to strengthen

these teams with non-Cuban contract personnel. Ultimately, when

an internal uprising of strength develops they could be landed either

recruit, train, and lead (or participate in) "hit and run" guerrilla

bands and/or remnants thereof. These groups will require both

maritime and aerial re-supply. Attrition will be high. The psy-

chological warfare program in support of this effort must be

aggressive and hard-hitting if recruits are to keep flowing to the

guerrillas. It is estimated that within a year twenty small groups

of guerrillas can be activated.

It is not possible to predict

what the rate of attrition will be, but approximately 50% appears

probable. The teams to be infiltrated should have at least four

months Special Forces type training at DOD sites with Special

Forces instructors.

The trainees could be handled in groups of

fifty with two groups in training at a given time.

5. Cuban Exile Forces - The recruitment and training of

Cuban exiles by the U.S. Armed Forces should be pressed to the

maximum. Upon completion of their training, arrangements

should exist to permit the separation of selected individuals or groups

to permit the formation of a "Cuban Freedom Fight"-under responsible

exile leadership which can quickly be used to augment any significant

internal uprising. Non-Cuban, U.S., and other contract personnel

should be permitted within the "Cuban Freedom Fighter" groups.

Additional Policy approval is required.

6. Infiltration/Exfiltration - The increased Cuban defensive

capabilities plus the above outlined aggressive resistance program

requires freedom to utilize all possible infiltration/ exfiltration

tactics as required, including:

a.

Present and planned commercial/private maritime

capability.

D. Submarines and other naval crait

c.

aircraft.

Aerial overflight with contractor USAF crewe and
