In May, 1956, MM T-10 advised that RON WARNOCK

had been campaign manager for ARNOLD ZEMPLE,

returned from Havana, Cuba.

He advised that while in Cuba

he was in contact with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, who was still trying

that actually he still owns the same interest as he formerly

did.

MM T-Il advises that originally RON WARNOCK went

to Havana, Cuba, in the hopes of putting Spanish language

punchboards in that area.

He advised that WARNOCK was unable

to make arrangements for the punchboard, operation but that

while he was in Havana, he was in contact with the operator

MM 92-88

MM T-1l advises that the source of capital that

was to be used in purchasing the Sans Souci. Casino was from

Seattle.

He stated that actually he and WARNOCK could not

raise sufficient funds to purchase the casino but at the

same time, due to the inactive gambling patrons in the form

of tourists in Cuba, caused them to have little desire to

pay the amount necessary to purchase this casino at this

time.

Hotel Plaza Casino

MM T-9 advised on March 10, 1959, that he had been

informed by

JOE STASSI, one of the major interest holders

in the Hotel Plaza Casino, that STASSI had made a "payoff"

to an official of the Cuban government (unidentified) in the

amount of $50,000.00 in order to obtain permission for the

Hotel Plaza Casino to reopen. Source stated that although

the Hotel Plaza Casino now had permission to reopen, they

had no "bankroll" with which to operate and that STASSI and

other interest holders are contacting individuals in the

United States in an effort to obtain a new bankroll.

major interest holder, is patronized principally by Cubans

and is managed by BENNY FERNANDEZ, who was brought to Cuba

by TRAFFICANTE from Tampa, Florida.

been no indication as yet of resuming gambling activities
