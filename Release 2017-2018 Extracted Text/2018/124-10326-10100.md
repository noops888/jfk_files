/ As you are aware, James Angleton of CFA frequently turns i
over to the Bureau on a highly confidential basis information which
has been developed through operations headed by Angleton. In -many
instances the information is given to the Bureau without clearing
through regular CIA channels, In almost all instances it is given
to us with the clear understanding that if included in a report or
other communication prepared for dissemination outside the Bureau
the information will be so set forth that it cannot be traced back

to either ‘Angleton CIA. in such instances where the information i

in his opinion, recipient agencies gically conclude that

are concerned, Angleton requested that the information merely

could be described as being of known reliability. :

the Liatson Section could work out a procedure whereby Angleton
might be referred to as a Bureau informant.This would permit the
Supervisors receiving the Angleton material firsthand to transmit
it to the field and advise the field that the information in any
report should be attributed to an informant with a temporary symbol
number, which informant could be evaluated as having furnished in-
formation of a reliable nature in the past. On the informant page
