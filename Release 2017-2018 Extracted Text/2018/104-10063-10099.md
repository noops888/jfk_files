A. The Campus, Rucicaiis - The Deciine of SDS As A Significant Force

-The 1909 SDS Chicago convention irreparably split the organiza-

On Sunday, December 27, 1970 some 500 delegate members of the

PLP faction arrived in Chicago for what may “be SDS's last convention,
still seeking to weld an alliance with blue collax workers who despise
them. The Weathermen faction, decimated by governmental crackdowns,
its leadership or most of those still at liberty fugitives from the. .
law, and a rank and file increasingly disenchanted with violence, .un-
invited did not attend. The four-day get-together, marked by more
acrimonious and seemingly endless debate, stressed the need for fur-
ther missionary work among the working class. Attendance - gown to

served that outlaws living underground do not have a sense of what

she outlined proposed future activities to: "Change and share the

: The Background

For a variety of reasons, not the least of which are the violence
of their revolutionary rhetoric, their imagé as a group with internal
discipline, and possessing the "machismo" to "shoot it out" with the
police, the Black Panthers were internationally proclaimed by various
self-professed white rcvolutionsuries as being the vanguard qf “the
Revolution."' Panther leaders were wined, dined, and fussed over in
Pyongyang, North Korea, by an obvious government sanctioned group, a
“Committee for, the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland." The Party
has been lavishly praised by Maoist China, and eagerly courted by the

Russians. Arab guerrillas entertained visiting Panthers and reports

“ca THE NEO FASCISTS

‘A. Klan Kapers

As is the case with other nationwide. right-wing extremist. ylove-
ments, the Klan hangs on, with just enough activity to sustain /organ-
izatfonal life. United Klans of America Imperial Wizard Robert Shel-
don; released from jail about a year ago, has been making strenuous |

“efforts to rebuild on the foundation of the old Klan.” A tireless
‘traveler, Sheldon has been on the lecture circuit, making radio and

"television appearances (as the nation's #1 Klansman he apparently
“warrants being put on exhibition) and meeting regularly with local
‘klavern leadership. The United Klans remains the largest in a still
highly fragmented Klan led by ambitious and competing Imperial Wizards.
Latest (March 1970) official estimate by FBI puts total Klan member-

“ship at about 5500. But there are recént stirrings, motivated by a
desire to capitalize on left-radicai inspired violence. Klan activity
has been apparent in Pennsylvania (North Philadelphia, York and Bucks
County), Atlanta, Georgia, Wilmington, Delaware, North Carolina,

: Michigan and Florida. Some measure of political respectability ac-
crued to the Klan when the Michigan American Independence Party, sup-

porters of George Wallace, nominated the State Grand Dragon as its

Candidate for. Secretary of State in.last November's elections. (A

Klansman was a candidate for Pontiac's City Commission, but.withdrew

because of what he described as "tareats.") :



On November 29th Alabama's Lieutenant Governor elect Jere L.
Beasley addressed the United Klans national "klonvokation" in
Birmingham, Alabama and U.S. Senator James B, Allen in a telegram,
- expressing regret at his inability to attend because of his wife's *

- illness, pledged his continued fight against the "Federal bureaucracy."

In early January, the Florida Klan (affiliated with the U.S. Klan)
-conducted a vigorous orgunizing campaign in the Tampa area. * Grand ~
Dragon John Paul Rogers, seeking to eradicate the night riders' ter-
rorist image, described the Klan as a "Christian Crusade dedicated to -
honoring the American flag, revering the Bible, destroying Communism,"
and "upholding White supremacy." Rogers boasts that "within a few
years we'll'be so strong that without our endorsement, no candidate

B. Minutemen Minutiae ie cee pice eee ee eee Ve
_ With the surfacing in Washington, D.C. last December of A6 year
old George Van NeSs, self-described East Coast leader of the Minute-
men, it became apparent that a split in the once monolithic Minute- ©
Man organization was in the making. Never more than 5000 strong a
nationally (present total membership is/ believed to number 200) the ~
organization was run by founder Robert DePugh with an iron hand, and
card carrying members throughout the country were loyal to him. For
the past few years DePugh has had troubles with Federal authorities,
and for 17 months was a fugitive from justice. Taken into custody + :
by Federal agents in July 1969, DePugh was ultimately tried, convicted

“ ‘and on October 9, 1970 sentenced to nine concurrent Federal prison

terms of 10 years each on nine counts of violating Federal. firearms
regulations. aes : pene : eee .

Wan Ness, ina Hyattsville, Maryland news conference, declared
that the Minutemen would henceforth be independent of DgPugh, and that
he would be the liaison between. the membership, which hé said would
| remain underground, and the general public. Van.Ness declared that

the organization still was preparing to thwart a Communist takeover;:
that paramilitary maneuvers "in the mountains" were still an integral
part of their training regimen; and secreted away for future use was
ammunition, two mobile field hospitals, four communications vehicles,.
and machinery for an "intelligence network." The new Minutemen credo
will avow their belief in white supremacy, with blacks and Jews put
on notice that they would have to earn the right to equality. :

Van Ness' Minutemen organization is in opposition to the apparatus
left behind by DePugh to carry on until his ultimate release from
prison. Spokesman for the still loyal to DePugh faction is 25 year old

Minutemen are now a youth oriented organization, and that although
weapons and explosives were "still part of their training" Minutemen
are under strict orders to refrain from acts of violence at this
time."

“DePugh, while a fugitive, was groping for a "philosophy" for the
"movement," and for those who, like himself, had “somehow escaped the
brainwashing of the estabiishment controlled news media, the horrors
of progressive education, and the sophistry of modern Christianity."

Byers' plan for a campus based organization was originally con-"
ceived as a vehicle to mobilize cadres of rightist students on campus
to "crush" radical leftists. NYA evolved into a movement with a four
point program: (1) To oppose the.use of dangerous drugs and narcotics


: H .
and to run those who push them off the campus; (2) To neutralize and
overcome Black Power; (3) To restore law and order to the campuses

and to America by stamping out anarchist groups and movements and [4}
To bring peace to America by resisting any attempt to involve us in 4

foreign war. (Emphasis has been on the Middle East rather than
Indo China). a -

Organizational meetings have taken place on college campuses in
New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California. Byers claims, ex-
aggeratedly perhaps, a nationwide membership of more than 8,000 from
62 campus chapters. NYA publishes a monthly tabloid type newspaper
Attack ("to serve as an agitational and recruiting tool among young
Americans, mainly university students") with a claimed circulation

/ o£ 25,000 and a monthly newsletter Action with a claimed circulation |
_ o£ 4,000. : cena :

In addition to membership recruitment, current emphasis is on the
welding together of “hard hitting action units" which will participate
in rallies and demonstrations and if need be physical confrontation

-. with campus left-wing radicals, and undertake the mass distribution of
racist, anti-Semitic propaganda. A "Western Destiny" bookstore just
~ opened in Washingtan, D.C. stocks for mailorder,and over the counter
sales, books, tracts, and pamphlets. Inventory consists of anti-
Zionist, pro-Nazi and racist material, a portion of which was taken ~
over from the now closed bookstore maintained by the’late Lincoln ca
Rockwell's National Socialist White Peoples Party.” : a :
: Recent issues of Action have become stridently anti-Semitic. The.
Fall 1970 lead article was headlined "Mideast War Next Vietnam for
U.S.," with a sub-heading "Zionist Trap To Become New Slaughter, of
American Youth," and featured alleged Zionist atrocities stories, :
grotesque and anti-Semitic cartoons. Byers, in a Letter to the Editor
of the Washington Post (January 6, i971) stated that: "The NYA opposes
. Zionism in America because Zionists,.in their self-tentered pursuit of
“s-their own, extra-American goals, have not only shown a callous disre-
-. gard of American interests in favor of Zionist interests, but they have

habitually been willing to adopt anti-American policies whenever this
=. suited their aims." . nie

: Of late NYA has been beset by internal difficulties, with some
défectors seeking to create a competing organization. Byers, now as-
sisted by former American Nazi Party lieutenant Robert A. Lloyd, remains
as the dominant influence. : eee

The significance of an NYA lies in the fact that-for the first time
in recent history, a campus based, neo-Nazi movement is in existence.
It, remains to be seen if this ultra-rightist group organized to combat
left-wing excesses can survive in its new form as a neo-Nazi, anti- -
_ Semitic force on the college campus. . . : .
