A. The Campus. Radicils - The Decline of SOS As A Significant Force

The 1909 SDS Chicago convention irroparably split the organizi-

The second faction to emerge, Maoist and rigidly Marxist -

that the time was not row, and that revolution could only be brought

about with support from blue collar workers.

YSA lacks the SDS popuiar appeal of a few years back, and has little

potential as a catalyst for student violence.

B. A Change In The Weather?

In the latest (December 6, 1970) in a series of prophetic

"they cannot do that which is necessary to radicalize people."

While the proposed change in Weatherman action may be more

tactical than philosophicad, it is a fact that many students, pro

fessing dedication to the necessity of revolution now, have been

shocked by the results of some bombings.

Violence has not brought

turn, it was said, would

bring Weathermen mass sympathy and support.

In all probability there

will be a change in the revolutionary weather, for how long we do not

know.

C. Campus Demonstrations - Winter Hibernation?

Spring, the traditional season for campus disturbances,

is some

months off.

Accordingly despite a marked lull in protests

since

September it may be premature to dogmatically state that a major

polarizing student offensive against U.S. Indo China policy or some

form of "Establishment" authority is not in the cards. Student domin

The National Student Association, now considerably more leftist

than

previously, is.formulating plans for yet another anti-war rall!

to publicize the

signing of a "peace treaty" by U.S., Saigon, NLF

Yet there are discernible signs that a national student protest

of such magnitude and intensity capable of polarizing the nation to

the extent that did the May 1970 dimonstrations is only a slight

possibility,

barring an event wich the emotional charge of a major

military adventure in Indo China.

The Kert State killings had a

sobering effect on sudents, particuiarly the realization that it

could happen on their campus.

The senseless killing at Wisconsin

and other random bombings have undeniably diminished the romance of

violence as a condition precedert to a revolution which, incidentally

now no longer seems inevitable or necessary.

spread publicity was given the November 1970 offer by the Black

Panthers to the Vietcong's Liberation Armed Forces to send fighting

troops to

aid in the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Clearly, the Panthers had preempted the American field as a

swashbuckling, gun toting, "committed to the revolution" force,

idolized by the majority of America's white radicals and extremists.

With all the fanfare over the Black Power movement, the curiosity

created by Black Nationalisn, the publicity bestowed on

ephemeral al-

and the excitement gererated by the Black Panthers, the Black Muslims

have been all but ignored.

B. Minutemen Minutiae

With the surfacing in Washington, D.C. last December of 46 year

old George Van Ness, self-described East Coast leader of the Minute-

men, It became apparent that a split in the once monolithic Minute

man

organization was in the making.

Never more than 5000 strong

nationally (present total membership ig believed to number 200) the

organization was run by founder Robert DePugh with an iron hand, and

card carrying members throughout the country were loyal to him.

the past few years DePugh has had troubles with Federal authorities,

und for 17 months was a fugitive from justice.

by Federal agents in July 1969, DePugh was ultimately tried, convicted

and on October 9, 1970 sentenced to nine concurrent Federal prison

terms of 10 years

each on nine counts of violating Federal firearms

regulations.

Van

Ness, in a Hyattsville, Maryland news conference, declared

that the Minutemen would henceforth

he would be the liaison between. the

remain underground, and the general public.

Van. Ness declared that

the organization still was preparing to thwart a Communist takeover;

that paramilitary maneuvers

"in the mountains" were still an integral

part of their training regimen; and secreted away for future use was

ammunition, two mobile field hospitals, four

communications vehicles,

and machinery for an "intelligence network."

De Pugh, while a fugitive, was groping for a "philosophy" for the

of progressive education, and the sophistry of modern Christianity."

His quest ended with the discovery of "Imperium," the Francis Parker

Yockey anti-Semitic tome embraced by most of today's more erudite neo

Nazis.

The contending factions of the remains of the DePugh organizatio

seem destined to go their own route: Both seem to endorse hostility
