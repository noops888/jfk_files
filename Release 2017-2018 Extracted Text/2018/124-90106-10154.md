VSER

For several years Tuya Cuban Expres was favored with your air shipments

to Cuba.:

In 1960, due to the communist take-over, and the imprisonment of

my fat her and me, our ope rations were discontinued. Today, we are engaged

in the struggle against communism through "Comandos: L", and I come to ask

for your support.

Comando's "I"' was created in 1962 by a group of freedom-loving Cubans, most

of them businessmen and professionals, with no personal or political ambi

tions other than the liberation of Cuba. Their efforts and accomplishments

were clearly di sclosed by LIFE magazine of April 12th, 1963, whose front

cover displayed a remorable drawing of the attack on the Russian Ship Baku.

Lam convinced that victory over communism can be achieved if we

recognize.

that the international communist conspiracy is waging total war against us,

and that the re-establishment of democracy in Cuba is the greatest contribu-

tion we can make now to the sacred cause of world peace, a cause for which

many members of Comand os "I" have given their lives.

Stand with Comandos "I". Give us your spiritual support and your financial

to mage our wat

Your contribution will help provide the solid fin ancial backing neede

war against communism, today firmly entrenched only 90 miles

from your shores.
