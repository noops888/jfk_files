Reference: DIE 43259 :

i sbesijeeat to Rabney's discussion of QIWIN
on 17 April 1961, Headquarters indicated to Rabaey that 0!
wille might-have to be-déferred. | Accordingly, Rabaey tal
there might well be a long delay Iu moving him to Leopoldville
him in Europe. Following Rabuey's retura to Headquarters, ‘
reference to keep QUWIN sn Europe at least six months longer as 8 KUTUBE/D
PA and spotter. The reasons for this decision are simply that the pressures for
certain types of KUTUBE/D operations are increasing and that GJWIN is one of
our very few assets who can deal with the kinds of persons we are secking. The
following paragraphs will provide you with the information you need at present for
contact with him. : :

2. Although the contract signed by CUWIN (s for Leopeldvilie; we regard
tt as valid for continued work {n Europe or elsewhere. This 1o the ueual type of
contract for foreiga agents, and we are providing you herein only the specifics
applicable to the administration of QJWIN: His salary is $7,200 per annum (please
pay him $600 in cash at the end of each month). He will be advanced or reimbursed
travel expenses for authorised operational travel. He will be entitled to per diem
ia Liew of subsistence in the course of all travel performed for us. He will be ad~
vanced or reimbersed funds for necessary operational expenses facluding, bat not
limited to, entertainment and the purchase of information, The contract is effec-
tive 1 March 1961 for one year unless sooner terminated by ODYCKE (a) by 69 cays
notice to QJWIN, oF (b) without prior notice in the event af a breach of the contract
by QJWIN's violation of ‘security or by his otherwise rendering himself unavailable
for acceptable service. The contract a:ay be extended upon notice from ODYOKE.

accountings for travel and operational funds, we-do not wish to hold him toa rigid |
accounting for every cent (for cue reason, this would entail his making detailed
fiaancial notes as he moves about, in'iteelf a potential breach of security). - it will,
avifice if he provides you with whatever supporting documents are normally avail-
able to him (euch a6 hotel bills), if he gives you a general accounting for the use
of funde, and if you are satisfied that the funds were properly. Our experi-
exces with him so far have provided no‘indications of rivuse of farts. ne

u 4 During the discussion with QJWIN on 2 May, he raised two problems
__in the event of postponémeat of hie move to Leopoldville:

a.  Whei itis decided to move him, he ‘would appreciate ‘ody
a children to complete their then curk
gister for the next following term in Leopotdi
will be givea the fullest possible coasideration.

choot

b. he ts to remain in Burope for any length of time at car behest,

‘aa he now will per reference, he should move out of Luxembourg with his family.
As he correctly pointed out, he has no cover Job, now haa a good salary, is known
to the Gendarmerie in Luxembourg, and he foresees difficulty in explaining his
work, source of income, declaration of income tax, etc. We agree with his view-
point, and this problem is under active consideration. He cannot, of course, move
to Belgium with a sentence hanging over hie head there. We are reluctant to move
him-te Francé since he was once convicted there, and application for a residence
permit would result in a police files check with possible resultant and uodesirablo’
police attention to him. Furthermore, slace a good deal of his search activity has
taken place and will take place in France, we far prefer to have him reside else-
whore. Switzerland might be # possibility (except for tight police cortrols), bat
Germany appears to be a better possi lity. If QIWIN does move to Leopoldville

- at the end of this year, he can probably survive the period in Luxembourg. If the
move is to be postponed beyond the end of this year - and we shall tet you know as
soon as this iv decided - he should be relocated. In the meantime, please discuss
the above possibilities with him and let us know Ais ideas on residence other than
Luxembourg and on possible cover for his residence clsewhere. :

: 5. During April 1961, QJWIN epotted some candidates in Fraace, Two
or three of thece will have to ke revisited by him for a second look at them, and to
obtain data which he was not able to obtain during the first contact without arousiog
suspicion on their part. We shall inform you and send pertinent details (by dispatch
{f time permite) when we desire that this be done. In the meantime, please inform
QJWIN that the need for his recontacting these people without undue delay is recog~
nized and is on the front burner.

: 6. With regard to funding QJWIN, it ts requested that he pe given his
pay, travel money, operational money, and any other necessary fands in cash
duriog personal contatte only. (We were disturbed to note in the report of hie
LCFLUTTER examination his statement that money was deposited to the Banque
Internationale for him by the American Embassy. The deposit was pursuant to a
request fram Leopoldville, but the method of deposit was counter to the maximum
security we are trying to apply to our use of QJWIN. »

7% Et is essential that from aoow on all traffic be handled as follows:

: a. Cables to be elugged RYBAT ZRRIFLE only. (QJWIN is still the
eryptonym for the person and should be used in referring to him, Sut the slugging
must be as stated above to insure maximum security. ).

b. Dispatches to'Headquartere are to be sent te KUTUBE/D only,
in the original and one copy only, stan.ped TOP SECRET LAURICLE. The dis-
patches are to be sent in sealed envelopes marked TOP SECRET, LAUFICLE,
