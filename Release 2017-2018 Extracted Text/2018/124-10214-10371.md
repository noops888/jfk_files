that the building be looked over to see if there was any possibility
of burning it to the ground. Corretjer claimed that Manolo Ray, who

to begin recruiting people because he was to be head of the army.
Sierras wanted the list of personnel immediately in order to present it

of his plans from the organization. He also wanted to determine whether
the group would follow Manuel Artime Buesa and Manuel Ray Rivero. Sierra

The "Miami Herald," issue of 1/19/64, carried an article in
which the Ejercito Libertador de Cuba (Liberation Army of Cuba - ELC)
| (105-110055) announced its union with JURE headed by Manolo Ray.

On 1/22/64 Dunney Pio Perez Alamo, who had been Chief of

Military Operations for ELC, advised that the ELC at one time was part
of the same group which currently comprised JURE. He stated that
Manuel Ray had been leader of the MRP at the time of the Cuban invasion

; in April, 1961, and that the MRP was the forerunner of JURE, of which

| Ray was the regarded leader although he was only one of. the members of
the Executive Board of JURE. He continued that after the defeat of
Cuban forces in the April, 1961 invasion, Ray resigned from the MRP
and organized JURE at a meeting of former MRP members in Puerto Rico.

i At the time Ray resigned, the ELC was formed from a segment of the former

i MRP. Perez further related that he and other members disputed the
description of Ray "Fidelismo without Fidel" (desiring the same type of
government as Castro). He regarded Ray as a firm believer in democratic
principles and stated that Ray was one of the first in Cuba to work in
opposition to the Castro regime once he saw that Castro was taking Cuba
in the direction of communism. Perez stated that Ray renounced his
position as Minister of Public Works under Castro in 1959 and at that time
began to work clandestinely in Cuba to organize his MRP before he toaic
exile in the US around latter 1960.

of "Operation Judas" to which informant replied negatively. Nonnenmacher
explained that this was a plan for the assassination of Fidel Castro
and the taking over of the Cuban Government’ by new leadership with
Hubert Matos as the new head, Manuel Ray as a prominent leader and Eloy
Gutierrez Menoyo as Chief of the Army. Nonnenmacher indicated that this
plan would operate in accord with an internal uprising in Cuba and asked
inforniant's opinion. Informant did not believe the plan would succeed
and feit that it would probably be impossible since Matos was in prison,(yp
Cutierrez had been a traitor too often, Ray was not trusted by many
Cubans, and individuals inside Cuba were under strict police supervision

Nonnenmacher further asked informant's opinion of Ray, Armando
