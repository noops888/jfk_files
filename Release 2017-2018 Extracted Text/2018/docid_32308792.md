Cullennsylvania, and accordingly he shipped some of the machines

to ALBERTYARDURA and NORMAN ROTHMAN of the Tropicana Night

Club. in Havana in an attempt. to

na die overnet a nato non

MANNARINO stated that in

addition to using the machines in the Iropicana Night club,

the Cuban Government had granted them permission to place the

machines in various spots throughout the islands of Cuba

in much the same fashion as slots were formerly used in the

United States.

MANNARINO admitted that he would have

an interest in this slot machine operation.

SAMUEL

MANNARINO, on March 14, 1958, advised that he had

recently returned from a visit to Camague about ine Cuban

and while

there picked up a great deal of knowledge

pineapple business and was seriously considering making an

investment in that field. MANNARINO pointed out that he also

visited Chicago, Illinois, very recently and added that for the

past several months, he has been locating slot machines in the

"Tri-State area" for NORMAN ROTHMAN. MANNARINO said that a

number of the machineshad already been shipped to ROTHMAN and

each transaction was arranged in such a manner that only the

name of the seller and ROTHMAN, the consignee, were made a

matter of record.

MANNARINO explained that in each instance

the Department of Justice in Washington, D. C., and the U. S.

Attorney in Chicago, Illinois, were notified of the shipments

destined for ROTHMAN.. In conclusion, MANNARINO emphasized

that beyond locating

the machines for ROTHMAN he had absolutely

no personal interest in the machines whatsoever.

A source, whose reliability.is not known but who has been close

to the MANNARINO organization, advised on March 17, 1958,

that during the period 1951 - 1952, he had a twenty per cent

interest in the Sans Souci where he was employed as General

Manager. Source explained that while working at the Sans.

Souci he answered solely to NORMAN ROTHMAN, who evidently haga

the largest share in the club since he appeared to be

the person in authority.. Source, when asked whether SAMUEL

or GABRIEL MANNARINO Of

New Kensington had an interest in the

Sans Souci, replied that he could not honestly say they did,

unless ROTHMAN was fronting for them.

Source explained that
