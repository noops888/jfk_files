REFERENCE : USA V. Gerald P. Hemming, Et Al. (76-371-CR-CA)

1. During the period of my employment as a-Special Agent. at the
Drug Ent wont cAcalinietration Gi 1071 - don 1977), T conducted an
interview of Gerald Patrick Hemming (DPOB 1 March 1937, at Los Angeles,
California) on 23 May 1975 at DEA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

My report concerning that interview has become part of the case file
in USA v. Gerald P. Hemming, Et Al., Case Number 76-371-CR-CA,
Southern District of Florida, Miami, Florida.

2. Upon my entrance on duty in SE Division on 5 January 1977,
I orally informed the Division Security Officer, Billy Hix, about
the information in paragraph 1 above. Mr. Hix asked me to submit
the information in writing as soon as I was settled in the Division.
On 7 January 1977, however,,Special Agent Robert Fredericks
telephonically contacted{ DC/SE/X/LA, and told her that
the United States Attornery, Southérn District of Florida, had
requested that I appear. at the U.S. Courthouse, Miami, Florida on
10 January 1977 to confer with the Assistant United States Attorney,
Karen L. Atkinson, regarding my appearance as a witness in behalf of the
U.S. Government in the trial of Gerald P. Hemming.

3. During the afternoon of 7 January 1977 I conferred with Mr. Hix
who advised me to contact the Office of the General Counsel. I talked
to Mr. Edmund Cohen who advised me to get in touch with the Office of
Security, External Activities Branch (OS/EAB). I completed an
Outside Activity Approval Request (Form 879), obtained the concurrence
of DC/SE, Mr. John Stein, and submitted the Form 879 to OS/EAB.

OS/EAB sent me to Central Cover Staff (Mr. Blandford) and then to the

Office of the General Counsel. After discussions with Mr. Cohen, I called



ey : <

S/A Fredericks in Miami at Mr. Cohen's suggestion. S/A Fredericks was
not available. Mr. Cohen then advised me to retum to my office and
he would contact. me with further instructions. Mr. Cohen retained
the Form 879, Subsequently, Mr. Cohen advised me that I-should travel
to Miami as requested and that CIA would reimburse me for expenses
connected with my activities in behalf of the U.S. Government. He
further advised me that being in an overt cover status I should state,
if asked under oath, that I am currently a CIA employee.

4. On 10 January 1977 I traveled to Miami where T met and
conferred with AUSA Karen Atkinson and DEA S/A Robert Fredericks.
They informed me that Gerald P. Hemming's case had been severed and
his trial would not begin on 11 January. AUSA Atkinson told me she
wanted me as a rebuttal witness if Gerald P. Hemming presented the
defense that he had been working at the direction of DEA. She said
they would not call me until and unless that defense was presented.
She also said that she felt that any attempt to question me concerning
my current place of employment was irrelevent and she would object to
any such line of questioning. She said she would only ask me where
I was employed at the time T interviewed Hemming. I returned to

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM: Edmund Cohen
Assistant General Counsel

SUBJECT: U.S. v. Hemming

of

Gary Mattocks and Robert Barteaux, travelled to Miami to confer with

ge Hoeveler, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas M. Sherouse, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida, about subject case. Messrs] land
Mattocks had dealt with Mr. Hemming while they were employed by the Drug
Enforcement Administration and Mr. Sherouse wanted them available as rebuttal
witnesses. Mr. Barteaux also was sought as a possible rebuttal witness to describe
the Agency's relationship with Mr. Hemming in the event that Hemming raised a
CIA defense.

2. On 23 November Mr | Mr. Barteaux and the undersigned met in
chambers with Judge Hoeveler, Mr. Sherouse, Mr. Roger Howard, law clerk to
Judge Hoeveler, and Mr. Ted Sakowitz, Public Defender for the Southern District

of Florida. Mr. Sherouse decided that Mr. Mattocks would not be required to
testify and he did not attend the meeting. The Judge initially expressed some reluc-
tance to have an ex parte conference because Mr. Hemming had assumed primary
responsibility for his own defense with only limited assistance from the Public
Defender. The Judge insisted that a transcript of the meeting be made but he
promised that the transcript would be sealed and, in fact, would not be transcribed.

3. The undersigned indicated that the Agency had no interest in the outcome
of the case and interposed no objection,{o the introduction of any relevant information.
Our sole concern was to protect Mr ind his relationship _with’CIA both before
and after his DEA employment. The Judge was informed that Mr? sole con-
nection with Hemming was on 23 May 1975 and that he had no contact with Hemming
during any period of Agency employment. The national security consequences of
exposure of me? ommeal well as the career consequences were outlined. In addition,
the Judge was informéd that Mr. Barteaux was prepared to testify as an overt Agency
employee about any relationship between Hemming and CIA.

4. Judge Hoeveler asked Mr. Sakowitz to cross-examine Mr to

determine whether he had any information which might be relevant to Hemming's
defense. Mr. Sakowitz stated that although he was aware that Mr. Hemming wished
to call Mr [$s a witness, he was not fully informed of all aspects of the case
and, therefg re, reluctant to question Mr. }Thereupon, Judge Hoeveler,
swore in Mr nd proceeded to ask him a series of questions to determine
whether Mr | interaction with Mr. Hemming had been in any way connected
with his CIA emplo mt. At the conclusion of this examination the Judge gave

Mr. Sakowitz a second opportunity to question Mr? and when Mr. Sakowitz
again declined, he stated that in light of the national sécurity consequences which

had been ads to his attention he was not inclined to permit questions relating

to Mr IA employment.

5, At the conclusion of the conference in chambers, but before the jury was
admitted into the courtroom, Mr. Sherouse informed Mr. Hemming that Mr.
was available as a witness. When the trial proceeded Mr. Hemming concluded

is defense without calling mel Mr. Sherouse, however, did call Mr. z

las a rebuttal witness. On cross-examination Mr. Hemming asked Mr
whether he was with CIA. Mr. Sherouse promptly objected to the question,

Judge sustained the objection and Mr. Hemming went on to the next question. The
trial concluded soon afterwards without Mr. Barteaux being called as a witness.

It was subsequently learned that Mr. Hemming was found guilty as charged.
