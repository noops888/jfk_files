ar 127?),l conducted an

interview of Gerald Patrick Hemming (DPOB. 1 March 1937, at Los Angeles,

California) on 23 May 1975 at DEA Headquarters. in Washington, D.C:

My report concerning that interview has become part of the case file

in USA v. Gerald P. Hemming, Et Al., Case Number 76-371-CR-CA,

Southern District of Florida, Miami, Florida.

2. Upon my entrance on duty in SE Division on 5 January 1977,

I orally informed the Division Security Officer, Billy Hix, about

the information in paragraph 1 above. Mr. Hix asked me to

submit

the information in writing as soon as I was settled in the Division.

On 7 January 1977, however Special Agent Robert Fredericks

telephonically contacted

the United States Attornery, Southern District of Florida, had

requested that I appear at the U.S. Courthouse, Miami, Florida on

10 January 1977 to confer with the Assistant United States Attorney,

Karen L. Atkinson, regarding my appearance as a witness in behalf of the

U.S. Government in the trial of Gerald P. Henming.

3.

During the afternoon of 7 January 1977 I conferred with Mr. Hix

who advised me to contact the Office of the General Counsel.

I talked

to Mr. Edmund Cohen who advised me to get in touch with the Office of

Security, External Activities Branch (OS/EAB). I completed an

Outside Activity Approval Request (Form 879), obtained the concurrence

of DC/SE, Mr. John Stein, and submitted the Form 879 to OS/EAB.

OS/EAB sent me to Central Cover Staff (Mr. Blandford) and then to the

Office of the General Counsel. After discussions with Mr. Cohen, I called

S/A Fredericks in Miami at Mr. Cohen's suggestion. S/A Fredericks was

not available.

Mr. Cohen then advised me to return to my office and

He

further advised me that being in an overt cover status I should state,

if asked under oath, that I am currently a CIA employee.

4. On 10 January 1977 I traveled to Miami where I met and

conferred with AUSA Karen Atkinson and DEA S/A Robert Fredericks.

They informed me that Gerald P. Herming's case had been severed and

nanted me as a rebuttal witness if Gerald P. Hemming presented the

lefense that he had been working at the direction of DEA. She saic

She also said that she felt that any attempt to question me concerning

illy current place of employment was irrelevent and she would object to

any such line of questioning.

She said she would only ask me where

I was employed at the time I interviewed Herming. I returned to

Washington D.C.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Edmund Cohen

Assistant General Counsel

U.S.

v. Hemming

ary 2 tovember 1977 the undersigned accompanied by Messrs. ( 03

Gary Mattocks and Robert Barteaux, travelled to Miami to confer with

Judge Hoeveler, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas M. Shexouse, Un District

Court, Southern District of Florida, about subject case. Messrs.]

Mattocks had dealt with Mr. Hemming while they were employed by the Drug

Enforcement Administration and Mr. Sherouse wanted them available as rebuttal

witnesses. Mr. Barteaux also was sought as a possible rebuttal witness to describe

the Agency's relationship with Mr. Hemming in the event that Hemming raised a

CIA defense.

03=

2. On 23 November Mr.

Mr.. Barteaux and the undersigned met in

chambers with Judge Hoeveler, Mr. Sherouse, Mr. Roger Howard, law clerk to

Judge Hoeveler, and Mr. Ted Sakowitz, Public Defender for the Southern District

of Florida. Mr. Sherouse decided that Mr. Mattocks would not be required to

testify and he did not attend the meeting. The Judge initially expressed some reluc-

tance to have an ex parte conference because Mr. Hemming had assumed primary

responsibility for his own defense with only limited assistance from the Public

Defender. The Judge insisted that a transcript of the meeting be made but he

promised that the transcript would be sealed and, in fact, would not be transcribed.

3. The undersigned indicated that the Agency had no interest in the outcome

of the case and interposed no objection to the introduction of any relevant information.

Our sole concern was to protect Mr E

and his relationship with CIA both before

and after his DEA employment. The Judge was informed that Me?

Osole con-

nection with Herming was on 23 May 1975 and that he had no contact with Hemming

during any period of Agency employment. The national security consequences of

exposure of Mr.

as well as the career consequences were outlined. In addition,

the Judge was informed that Mr. Barteaux was prepared to testify as an overt Agency

employee about any relationship between Hemming and CIA.

4. Judge Hoeveler asked Mr. Sakowitz to cross-examine Mr.

to

determine whether he had any information which might be relevant to Hemming's

defense. Mr. Sakowitz stated that although he was aware that Mr. Hemming wished

to call Mr.

Tas a witness, he was not fully informed of all aspects of the case

and, therefore, reluctant to question Mr.

PiThereupon, Judge Hoeveler,

swore in Mr

and proceeded to ask him a series of questions to determine

whether Mr

interaction with Mr. Hemming had been in any way connected

with his CIA employment. At the conclusion of this examination the Judge gave

Mr. Sakowitz a second opportunity to question Mr:

and when Mr. Sakowitz

again declined, he stated that in light of the national security consequences which

had been brought to his attention he was not inclined to permit questions relating

CIA employment.

5. At the conclusion of the conference in chambers, but before the jurv was

admitted into the courtroom, Mr. Sherouse informed Mr. Hemming that Mr.

was available as a witness.

When the trial proceeded Mr. Hemming concluded

his defense without calling Mi

Mr. Sherouse, however, did call Mr.

as a rebuttal witness, On cross-examination Mr. Hemming asked Mr

whether he was with CIA. Mr. Sherouse promptly objected to the question, the

Judge sustained the objection and Mr. Hemming went on to the next question. The

trial concluded soon afterwards without Mr. Barteaux being called as a witness.

It was subsequently learned that Mr. Hemming was found guilty as charged.
