Memorandum of Conversation, Dan

Dated 6 September 1975

The referent memorandum contains two points

require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

In one form or another, the allegations are

The allegations are totally

thismatter are as follows:

check within the Agency at Headquarters

to determine whetjes

SLee Harvey OSWALD had ever been

ased by the Agency or been connected with it in any

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

He also ex-

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the warrén

Commission.

Although I had already checked. the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained ‹ before (plus those

items which had been integrated into the records system

of OSWALD had been requested by the foreign divisions

of their appropriate stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

I recall very clearly that we were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American returning

from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by

DCD, thus having

established contact with the Agendy-

The same point has now, quite understandably, been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been

to the USSR and returned to the US before

1957/1958.

Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that time was quite

uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in

those days.

The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end

of that decade there were so many persons travelling to

and from the SovietSUnion that DCD was incapable of talk-

ing to all of them'

Therefore, a program of selectivity

and specific target applicability was instituted.

In

light of therabove

i* seems to me that OSWALD if he

came to DC @attention at all--would have easily been

should be added that my above-described

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CIA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun.

But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i Mexico City.

We have now found that the: photograph that was ta sen was not

that of Oswald.

We do find from our informant dom there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

It is his

MEMORANDUM FOR: ME. Rocca

"Internal Mama Regarding Agency's Position in Dealing

with Warren Commission

The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the Dirgotor has received a telephone call from RA1030 A.

Tandingthe Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on tha

morning.

The DDP wishes to have from you a

but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews. I raised with Mi. HauMs the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive Wilsource.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that if should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction of made sure that the

Dizector is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

an the basiglodetailed questioning.

The DDP stared that he would

carefully and made a decision as

"estion of timing.

Given the schedule, you will

appi

that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

Back in the CIA offices, during Wllens! absence,

Slawson and Coleman discussed the cable traffic from the Soviet

there In September-October 1963 and immediately after the

assassination. Scott and White said that no Increases or

unusual variations had been noted at cither time.

We then dis-

cussed briefly the possibilities that the National Security

Agency might be able to "break" the codes for the times when

Oswald was in Mexico City, using as a key the fact that

Oswald's attempt to obtain a visa was probably communicated to

Washington on Friday or Saturday, Sertember 27 or 28. Scott

pointed out that all his office did with coded materials was

to send then back to the National Security Agency In Washington

and this neighborhood generally, the Cuban Enbassy and

Winston Scott had previously mentioned to us that he

he had anything along these lines and receiving a negative

The following are my notes

translated from the Spanish by Embassy personnel, on April 13,

1964. These notes are about as accurate and detailed as I

could make them without actually quoting the entire trans-

cripts. In a few instances, either where it was very Important

or where the meaning was obscure and therefore difficult to

paraphrase, I have quoted exactly. I have noted these portions

by placing them in quotation marks.

The voice in the Soviet Embassy agrees.)

This seems so because:

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or

sentence In the 2nd

subparagraph of paragraph 12b. Is there any significance

to the word,

"Althougk"? We wonder whether the informant

meant to say that there was something unusual In Mrs.

reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued

to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

Reference 1s again made to the 2nd subparagraph of

garagraph 120.

Your letter states that Mrs. Duran told the

Soviet Embassy" that Oswald"knew no one In Cuba" and that

the soviet official

"echoed her statement that the American

was not known.

It is unclear to us whether this discussion

Involved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Sovlet

officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not knowing

anyone in the sovlet and/or Cuban Embassies.

8. Reference is made to paragraph 12c.

Was the "direct

conversation" between one of the members of

the Soviet

Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was

at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that

Mira. Duran sent Oswald personally over to the Soviet Eubassy

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence

SUBJECT:

QJWIN

Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963,

following recommendations concerning the further handling

possible disposition of QJWIN:

I believe the original purpose for which

QJWIN was continued and sent to his

présent contract for this purpose

RONI BILED

QJWIN,

competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles

In Europe where we have very few assets.

Whether this

is of sufficient worth to continue bis

services depends

on the determination of how he can be used either by

che German Station or

the Austrian station

any other KUBARK Late as a long tern unofficial

cover agent.

He is not being used at the present time.

He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any

operational assignments are concerned.

C.

It is recommended that the present Chief of

Station Luxembourg and

RABNEY

be consulted by

Headquarters for their best recommendations as to

the continued use of QWIN.

After these recommendations

are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian

stations be consulted for their possible interest in

using him.

If after these discussions a sensible

Iramework

for the operational use of QJWIN can be

established, I would recommend we continue him.

If

not,

I would recommend that he be terminated at the

time his present contract expires.

As far as

the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation

which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for

security reasons and with which Fletcher I KNIGHT is fully

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck

me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

he information we need, because this individual looks odd."" We were

particularly interested

in the OI Oswald might provide on the Minsi

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "home".

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up sonething like two dozen similar cases.

We established links between

some of these women and the KGB. KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across.

It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1 Dissemination to the Intelligence Conmunity

E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically)

including

disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file.

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were,

therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's,

and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
