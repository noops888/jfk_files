Metorandum of Conversation, Dan
sHather/tes Midgley and the DCI,
Dated 6 September 1975

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and bees We crept up every so often
since then. In one form or x, the allegations are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD naacéee ‘connected with the Agency.

The allegations are totaly

@ Harvey OSWALD had ever been
used by the AgencXor been connected with it in any |
conceivable way. ordered me to make the checks
directly and personally to the degree possible and not
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R. |
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the Warren |
Commission. . . H

rechecked the Main Index and found no™:record beyond |
that which I had already obtained.béfore (plus, those 1
items which had been integrated inta the-records system H
since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO

4. I recall very clearly that we were extremely
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American:returning
from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by
Deb, thus having established contact with the Agency.
The same point has now, quite understandably, beén made
by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this \
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid
reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time. '
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD |
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite
uncommon. and we were hungry for eyewitness information in
those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade wtontcn so many persons travelling to
and from the SovdesSunion that DCD was incapable of talk- |
ing to all of hem’ Therefore, a program of selectivity |
and specificcfaxyet applicability was instituted. In
light of th@\aBove,<G& seems to me that OSWALD-- if he

came to D@D's)at! at all--would have easily been

him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J. EDGAR HOOVER
26 November 1963 - 11:20 a.m. oon

DCI: I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

Hr We have had the very best support that we could possibly |
expect from you.

Dal: Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

EB: We will feel free to do that

DCI: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to
make it.

H: We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question
that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i: Mexico City. i
We have now found that the. photograph that was ta cen was not

that of Oswald. We do find from our informant don there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has -
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him
the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wold take three
weeks. He had, I think, ‘a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

DCL: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there. We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.
Katee bved

Mc. Katzenbach iwho is handling it for the Department -_

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

SECRET of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report
that will be released to the public, probably through the White

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of tha Government agencies that are mentioned
in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc. |
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the °
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his :
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be |
sure that whatever is said in the report is conférredinandit |
is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said i
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

DCI: Well that will be fine, Thank you

2. The DDP wishes to have from you'a 5 Ge
comprehensive memorandum which highlights the baslt issues or
positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the
Commission. For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission
would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements
might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they
will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-
spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates
that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous
interviews. I zdiged with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

On 17 December Mr. Papich Se

anticipating a request from the ssion, named by President

Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials

supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

‘the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with the/Sylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich

inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of 7
t the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps.

Also, if possible, the FBI should devermine if it was common

Once again we asked Anderson to review the Gutierrez

Washington on this matter which we had not yet received. We i

were told that there were not. The status of the Gutierrez

the FBI Mex’.can office and therefore authenticating it would

be a problem to be handled eclsevhere. We agreed that we would

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

This seems so because:
a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the
Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban i

SUBJECT: . Letter to the Cen! gence Agency (CIA)
fhe JS, Posing Certain Guestions” on their Letter to Us

dated 31 January 1964

I would include in our letter to ion) CIA the following
- questions:

1. Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

+ supposed to have taken Place . in aa automobile outside the
* ” Cuban Enbassy in México City? -

2. Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet
Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Enbassy? If you
do, can we find out its contents?

- 3. Reference is made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your
letter. Would it be possible for us to see the full report
oe the Mexican police interrogatio: of Mrs. Duran and her |
yusbarid?. Ee, aa as sot

4. Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald,
"that same afternoon," came dack "again" to the Cuban
Enbassy. Does this mean that he was there twice the same
day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous
day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the
Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this !
sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed information i
found in the subsequent vication a8 In general, we would i

6. Reference is made ul en sentence in the 2nd
subparagraph of paragraph 12b. Is there any significance
to the word, "Although"? We wonder whether the informant
meant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran
reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued
to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

7 7. Reference is again made to the 2nd subparagraph of
aragraph 12>. Your letter states that Mrs. Duran told the
Soviet Embassy” that Oswald“knew no one in Cuba; and that
the Soviet official "echoed her statement that the American
_ was not known.” It is unclear to us whether this discussion
. 4nvolved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet
officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not knowing

anyone in the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies.

8. Reference is made to paragraph 12c. Was the "direct
conversation" between one of the members of the Soviet
Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was
at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that
Mrs. Duran sent Oswald personally over to the Soviet Seri)

: ta contact.” one. of the officials there? .-...

9. Reference is again made to paragraph l2c. Could
you olarify the many references to the "address" referred to
80 frequently in this paragraph?

10, ‘Throughout your entire letter the term "Soviet
Consulate” seers, to be used interchangeably with the term
soviet Embassy,“ Likewise with "Cuban Consulate" and

"Guban Embassy." We assume from this that the Soviet
Consulate and the Soviet oan inust be the same in Mexico
City, or at least ifp)fi Gand that the same
must hold true for hit an Consulate.

27 JUN 1963

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence
SUBJECT: Quwin

1. Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make
the following recommendations concerning the further handling
and possible disposition of QJWIN:

a. I believe the original purpose for which
QJWIN was continued and sent to his present under-

cover assignmen: EI ient validity
to justify the W yond the
termination of his present contract for this purpose
= ROUTED

b. QJUWIN, i Ro | competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles
in Europe where we have very few assets. Whether this
is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends
on the determination of how he can be used either by *
the German Station, or AZ Austrian Station or by
any other KUBARK Feta a long term unofficial
cover agent. He is not being used at the present time.
He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any
operational assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of
Station Luxembourg and RABNEY be consulted by
Headquarters for their best recommendations as to
the continued use of QUWIN. After these recommendations
are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian
stations be consulted for their possible interest in
using him. If after these discussions a sensible
framework for the operational use of QJWIN can be
established, I would recommend we continue him. If
not, I would recommend that he be terminated at the
time his present contract expires.

2. As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation
which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for
security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully
familiar as I orally advised you on 26 June 1963, except for
one precautionary "life line", aspects of this case have 4

been terminated and| f perhaps for minor
accountings, be co! A ie Fg

to 3 Walter P, HALTI

1, It makes little PR Ok BUTE concco had at poets an

OI interest in Oswald. As soon as I had heard Oswalf's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -~ sonetime in Summer 1960 --

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the laying

on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable channels. At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family fa ane
were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival. .

2. I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck >
me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I
told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get
the information we need, because this individual looks odd,"} We were
particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on the Minsk
factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city
itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop
target personality dossiers. .

3. I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at
the time, Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's arfival.
I do not know what action developed thereafter,

. heraonT neu

. 4 As an afterthought, ae ul i at the time I was becoming
.  inereasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered
in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually ~
divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "hone".
The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned ~
up something like two dozen similar cases, We established links between
some of these women and the KGB, KUDESK became interested in the developing
trend we had come across. It was partly out of curiosity to learn if
Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own exp: d in the U SSR, that we showed operational
intelligence interest in thi rvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that ~
effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1 Dissemination to the Intelligence Community
£.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

£.3  Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,
all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by
cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file. Ad-
ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.
Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff
received copies of all CSCI's.
