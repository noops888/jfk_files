SUBJECT: JFK names

So far, the DO has learned that C. Bustos (full name Charlotte Bustos-Videla} lives in Gacksonvile, Gi Ithas a PO Box, but not a home
address. The DO/IRO called the bank that receives her retirement check. He asked the bank to call her and have her call her old friend
about her retirement. The bank called Bill back and stated that Ms. Bustos had never heard of the old friend and was not interested. Bill
is now stumped on where to go.

Bill did contact R.W. Herbert. Mr. Herbert said revelation might cause some embarrassment to friends and associates. He will think over
the weekend about operational concerns. Mr. Herbert has relatives in Argentina, and a son who is an investment banker in London.
Further, he is president of two companies, one in Argentina and one in Addis Ababa.

Jalso spoke with Jeremy Gunn, Acting GC for the Review Board. | advised him that we were considering appealing on two names, but
had asked the DO to review the evidence of potential harm so we could make an intelligent decision. | asked him to find out whether the
Board would be receptive to a request for reconsideration short of appealing to the President. He thought such an approach would be a
good idea, but, obviously, had to talk to the Staff Director and Board Members. He is in New Orleans this week attending Board hearings,
but will be back in town next week.
