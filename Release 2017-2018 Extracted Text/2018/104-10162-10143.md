5. Referring to the just-announced capture of 17 raiders
at Norman Cay, Artime indicated’ that he was not particularly
exercised over them as individuals, but hoped the U.S. would
not be tricked into the position of bzing “what Castro
described as a protector of xissia and Cuba against exile
raiders." Of the exiles restricted to the Jade County area,
our bates duets acquaintance was Pedro diaz Lanz whom we
agreed had for some time been so uncontrollable as to raise
serious doubt's as to his mental stability. For his part,
Artime said, he hoped that. he would not be served with a
restriction notice since, if he was, he would depart the

“U.S. permanently with an attendant blast of publicity.

6. 1 asked about Jose Perez San Roman and leamed from
Axctime that Pepe had suffered a mental breakdown, that the
Robert Kennedvs had rented a home for Pene, his wife and two
children in the McLean area and that Artime had been with
them during the day when Mrs. Kennedy nad come tothe San Roman

and seen Artime. Artime learmed that the San Roman
ehildren were driven to and from school by the Kennedys. (It
turns out hat the Kennedy children, my three children, and
Pepe's two all attend the same parochial school on MacArthur
Blvd., so it is not ulikely that Pepe's children will seek
echoes $5 as the only cther Spanish-speaking children in the
scl . :

7. When I asked Artime’what tad brought about San Roman's
breakdown waa he indicated that it was the result of conflicts
arising from marital unhappiness and pressures on him by the U.S.
Govt, to persuade the Brigade to enlist in the U.S. Army. San
Roman apparently feels in retrospect that he should kave
evacuated the Brigade from the beachhead rather than sacrificing
it. Artime said tnat San Ronan was somewhat resentful over.
the fact that his psychiatric hill was being paid by Miro Cardona,
regarding it a way of making him indebted to Miro. (In the
context, I judged that Pepe viewed Miro as a symbol of the CRC.)

8  Artime also said that he had seen ar pea Fuentes and
Roberto Alejos in Guatemala and he suggested that Peralta's
coup had been amicably arranzed with Ydigoras. 1 inferred
that Artime had also seen Peralta on. his just-completed trip.

9. -Manolin Hernandez asked me about a certain "Col.. Earl

(lezernane who, he said, was living or had lived at the. Sheraton-

Park Hotel and who was moving through the Cuban exile community
looking for dark-skinned Cubans to be used in Haiti against

Duvalier, « gcording to Hernandez, Brennan asserts that his
activity is backed y the White House, his link being via
Ambassador Javid Bruce. Brennan's cone-on apparently, is
to tell former ney Fare members that if they help overthrow
Duvalier, Haiti will be at their disposal for whatever
action t] care to take against Castro,

10. In answer to their question, I said that I had not
Brennan in OSS in his self-described role, although
it was entirely possible that Brennan, like many other
officers, had actually served in CSS in one way or another,
4nd I pointed out that Dave Bruce had been Chief of our
Operations in ETO.

il, Hernandez commented that since the first of the year
he had been queried by both Jose Miro Cardona and Jose Ignacio
Rasco (MOC) as to whether I ("Eduardo") was still in the U.S.
and had denied any knowledge of my whereabouts,

12, By this time it was 2 otclock in the morning, the
three of us had downed a fifth of Sentch and we Tregrouned in

the kitchen where I prepared breakfast for all. Before leaving,

Artime said he would call me after he had seen the Attorn
