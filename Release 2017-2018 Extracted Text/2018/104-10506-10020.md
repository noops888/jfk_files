c. DBA 78315 dated 19 August 1964 (FBI):

Concerns Andrew G. BUCKNER akà Andy BUCKNER, and "Little

Caesar''

An FBI source reported that two employees of the Washington

Iron Works, Inc., Sherman, Texas told him that Harold TOTTEN, owner of

the business, and an employee, Andy BUCKNER, had made statements critical

of the U.S. Government and of high Government officials. Both TOTTEN and

BUCKNER reportedly had made so-called business trips to Mexico City in

the past. BUCKNER was reported to be purchasing agent for the firm.

BUCKNER had made remarkes among the firm employees that he believed Fidel

CASTRO of Cuba and Nikita KHRUSHCHEV of Russia to be smart people. Both

BUCKNER and TOTTEN criticised U.S. Govt policies and opposition to the

U.S. blockade af Cuba. They criticized the policies of both Presidents

Kennedy and Johnson. A few days before Pres. Kennedy was assassinated

on 22 Nov 1963, BUCKNER remarked to some of the firm employees that he

had read news stories about President Kennedy's planned trip to Texas and

thought "it would be funny" if something should happen to him. On the

afternoon immediately following Pres. Kennedy's assassination, BUCKNER

and TOTTEN were at the Iron Works, and after having heard of the

assassination, said it could not have been them because they were at the

Washington Iron Works at the time it happened. TOTTEN received newspapers

and literature from time to time in the names of John R. BRINKS and Thomas

E. EDWARDS. BUCKNER reportedly was hotheaded, thus the nickname "Little

Caesar."

Have asked Ops Liaison to obtain photo of BUCKNER from FBI to

determine if he is iden/with "Unidentified man".

d. DBA 99348 dated 18 Feb. 65 - Andrew Gormley BUCKNER (EBI)

d. continued -

The FBI contacted BUCKNER in Sherman, Texas on 28 Jan 65 for

an interview. He admitted receiving publications from China and the U.S.S.R.

TOTTEN was contacted by the FBI in Sherman, Texas the same day. The FBI

agent said in his opinion TOTTEN was a dangerous individual and a

"potential OSWALD." He considered it unsafe for an agent to contact him,

at his office and if an agent walked into TOTTEN's office, "he might

get a belly full of lead."

e. According to

report (NHA/524, dated March 1953,

one A. BUCKNER (Communist fellow travelers) was cited as driver for MOCZI,

the Hungarian Charge d'Affairs in the Netherlands.
