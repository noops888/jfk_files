HENORANDUM YOR: Director iD a .
Mational Security Agency Bi
SUBJECT 1 Villian &, MARTIN ;
% nuary 1968 this Agency received t!

following toformation from our lisison contact to a

a. The Canadian Press Correspondent ta Moscov,
Williag BUCKLEY, approachea our Eubassy informally in the
piodle of Leceaber on behalf of @illiam MARTIN, the
ex-eaployee of HSA who defected to the Soviet Union in 1960,

b, Accoraing to BUCKLEY, BARTIN wishes to see. his

pareate for compassionate reasons and wants to know if he
: would be adaitted to Canaua without fear of extradition to
. the United States if he vere to arrange a rendez-vous with”

bis parents in Vancouver, We do not :now vhother MARTIN

still has a United States pasaport or vhethor ne bas becose ;
: 2 Goviet citizea, In any eveat HARTIN considers himself
if inadaissible to the United States,

i c. BUCKLEY met HAATIN at the apartnert of

+ Hovard RAUSCH, the Moscow corresponaent for M:Grae-Hill
Publications, Ia addition EARTIN later telephoacd BUCKLEY

to itodicate hie iaterest in findiny out whether or not be
could cozc to Canada, BUCKLEY assumes, quite rightly I

would think, that the manner in ehi:n MARTIN hae made hie
request indicates that big aussisn hosts are avare of bis
interest in getting out of the Soviet Union to see his parents,

@, We bave informed our hmbassy that it should
take no action to encourage BUCKLEY or MARTIN to believe that
8 visa would be granted if MARTIN were to
application. Since, however, MARTIN's ia’
Canada is already in @ newspaperman's hands, ve caanot rule
out the possibility that BUCKLEY might write about MARTIN's .
interest. Such a story vould probably lead to the need for
a8 expression of the Canadian Government's attituce. Ia
making recoasoncatioas on the kind of response that might be
made in the event that a question is put to ay Minister, it

wouls Sc cvs usviul to knve what GéaTin's status in law is

Go far ag tho Unites States is concerned. If, for exanplo,
your Government could not taxe legal action, the Cenacian
authoritaes would be im a position if this matter came to
public attention to say that they tere not avare of any
barrier preventing MARTIN from seeing his parents in the United
States. [ should be most grateful if throuzh your channels

we could be provided informally eith an indication of

MARTIN tatus in law in the United States.

@. BUCKLEY's only other comment on MARTIN tas that
be dida't really know vhat to sake of MARTIN, MARTIN
Seemed outspoken in dealing with the shortcomings of life
im the Goviet Union, Oa the other band he spone with a
@light stamaer and seemed nervous. BUCKLEY's view far ehat
1t ie vorth io that MARTIN 1s not interested in getting tato
troublo sith the Russians or doing anything shich they might
coasider underhanded, I should eapbasize that no member of
the Canadian Embassy hag had any direct contact with HAKTIN,

2, On 18 January 1968 the Fedoral Burcau of Investigation
was advised of the foregoing informally, ia order to explore
the possibility of providing an indication of Subject's
status in law, as requested in paragraph 1. d. above.

3. This Agency was advised by the Department of State
oa 19 January that subject's parents had urittes to the
Departsaent advising that Subject would lise to visit his
parents, that he wes planning a visit to Canada, and
inquiring what Bubject's legal position would be if he cid
fadeed visit. The Department indicated that it planned to
inquire what the 0. 5, Embassy in Hoscow knew of Subject’s
travel plans, imcluding a check with the Canadian Eabaesy to
ascertain if Subject bad applied for a visa. The Departsent
was apprised of the informal Canadian inquiry as to Subject's
Status, but indicated that it vould refrain from masking any
refcronce to this ircuiry im seoxing information from the
U. 8. Eabassy im Moscow,
