18. December 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: DCD/OSG/OSB

ATTENTION

Craig Hale

SUBJECT

:Gordon Michael Dwane Novel

REFERENCE

: HH-27696, 10 December 1975

1. I have reviewed the allegations in reference that the

British, either British military or British intelligence (other-

wise not further specified), have outfitted a converted World

War II Liberty ship as a floating display case for British

military hardware.

I have further checked out the bizarre story

in paragraphs two and three of reference concerning use of the

British ship by MI-6.

2. This office has absolutely no information to substantiate

the story told in reference and Africa Division also has no

corroborating information.

3. In short, I consider the story developed in paragraphs

two and three of reference highly suspect since I do not believe

the British would be able to mount such an operation without it

coming to the attention of this office.
