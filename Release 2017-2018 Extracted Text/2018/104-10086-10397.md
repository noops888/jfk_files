1. On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
if : visited the Warrenton} Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such
bases : photographs, It appears that earlier photographs may have
. been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

». wcraapeowase: REPRODUCTION PROMIBITED

From the time. the Mexico Station was opened €in April 194) until
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of. Station(in_1955} the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a
mail intercept operation.

a i Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by (an employee of the Jocal}

Pencil telephone company who was} handled by a. Station case officer. The number

of lines tappéd was limited only by the availability of a listening post
od * | nearby and the availability of Tangauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
a American recruited agents.
Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer
‘-assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

* bassy (across the street) which had both.a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

ee

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street ‘on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate Photo-

“graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of
the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by. a re- :
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early (1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited ‘agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
“interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

(LIENVOY, was, run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by (Mexican)

vArmy officers In 1961, (because of mismanagement by the Mexican_prin-)
Ceipalss) the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post.

> suiccowsne REPRODUCTION PROMIBITEL

In mid-1962, (the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

G§oint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies .in anticipation of possible coverag§. The Station immediately

: Y
i @isconnected all of the unilateral telephone taps on these Embassies so

that they would not be discovered when the Mexicans hooked up their}

(taps. The. MexicansjJsoon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. “At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

i C000164



tr a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date ‘of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an Avierican identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviét Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before: since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis,
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of éach day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.

‘he instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

"photograph all Soviets, their families, all foretont. | and cars with

| foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

Were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a’ pulse camera which frequently developed niéchanical dif-

Tarasoff for translation because the caller was trying to speak in Russian.

There was some delay because Station Personnel waited to compare the
photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in
either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only
these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas.to go to Odessa.. He is told to call back at.1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

‘At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number ‘not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

«Item 395, pages 7-and 8 i

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a.call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Quba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he’ spoke at. the Soviet Embassy
because she*sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets -
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising ‘the (Department of) Iimigration in Cuba. She wants’ ~~
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not, advised..them of a-change of “address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
