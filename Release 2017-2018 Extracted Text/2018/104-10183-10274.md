Introduction.

1. The General Directorate of Intelligence (Direccion General de
Inteligencia - DGI) is the Cuban external intelligence agency,
gharged with maintaining security, collecting information,
and promoting Cuban Government intelligence policies abroad,
It is part of the Ministry of Interior Qtinisterjo del Inte-
rior), and was established sometime in mid-196I.” It 1s con-
Sorned only with operations abroad. The collection cf
intelligence within Cuba, counterintelligence, and security
are the respol bility of the Department of State Security
(Departamento de Seguridad del Estado - DSE). The two agencies
are independent but maintain liaison and coordination on cor-
tain matters.

2. The DGL, also known as "M," or “M Department," is organized
under a dircctor general and his deputy; its components, are

a main headquarters with administrative and personnel offices,
eight departments, and the director's office (see organization
Chart of page 14).2 [t is closely gonnected with Ramiro Valdes
Menendez, the Minister of Interior, and is also of continuing
interest to Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Ernesto “Che” Guevara.

gates located near the centet of the block on 80th Street. and a
back entrance with steel doors located directly through the
block on 78th Street. The main entrance is manned by quards
arned with PPShA machineguns;' the rear entrance is kept locked
and is used only in emergencie: No pass or identification is
required to enter the grounds,

The headquarters compound (sce diagram on page 15) contaans all
the DGI offices except PINEIRO's home office, the three: opera-
tional departments, and the Special Schools Department, described
below, The main building. called M Building, is situated near.
the center of the compound but off the main axis between the
gates. It houses most of the offices in its two stories and also
contains a canteen, public telephones, and a police radio for the
city and the Ministry of Interior. There are no large assembly
conferences are held in small rooms, Within the compound,
ated from M Building by driveways and parking lots, are

several other structures:

a. A two-story building housing the Personnel Department on the .

first floor and the Inspection Department on the second.

b. Three one-story service buildings: a guard office with
sleeping quarters for 20 to 25 guards, a food-storage ware-
house, and a clothing-storage warehouse. The guard office
itnd the Personnel-Inspection building flank the main entrance

on 80th Street,

c. A two-story building, in the angle of the grounds formed by
78th Street and 49th Avenue, housing the Technical Operational
Support Department, Two of its sections, the Photographic
Laboratory and the Concealment Device Section, occupy indi-
vidual boildings in the compound.

tranion of the DGI is handled from the M Building,
where PINELRO's deputy, (fnu) CHAIN,? pseudonym "Agusto," has

his office. sides acting as director general when PINEiRO is
away frou Cuba, CHAIN is responsible specifically for management
of large expenditures, South American affairs, and the approval

of false passports for travelers. He signs, in pseudonym, all
notices and circulars issued to the directorate. His secretary
has the pseudonym "Georgina." CHAIN's office, through "Vidalina,"
distributes cable traffic to the DGI departments, Incoming and
outgoing cable traffic and diplomatic pouch traffic are received
at this office from the Central Ciphering Service (Servicio
Central de Cifradus ~ SCC), which is a communal coding and de-
coding service operated by the DSE. CHAIN's office apparently
also acts as a receiving and distributing center for clandestine
radio traffic but docs not itself send or receive radio messages;
the actual transmission is possibly controlled by the Communist

Party.

Directly under the deputy director are two administrative depart-
t members, Personnel (Departamento de Personal) and

Tho Inspection Depart "Dario," which is
responsible for discipline in the directorate and for investiga-
tions of staff personnel, probably before hiring, has 10 to 12
members. Both department chiefs are probably former members of |
the DSE, and some of the office staff are also former DSK nember’.

Soviet Advisors.

Attached to the DGI headquarteis is a group of Soviet advisors,
who occupy officés in M Building. Their presence and identities
are kept as secret as possible, even among the officers who work
with them, and they are known only by pseudonyns. They have
especially close contacts vith Manuel PINEIRO and CHAIN, and
with the Illegal Department, whose officers can consult directly
with them at any time. Ordinary desk officers in other depart=
ments can consult the Soviet advisors only at their offices in
M Building,.where no special security precautions are observed,
but they do not see much of them except when visiting the
Illegal Department when the advisors are working there. The

~Sovieta can visit any department whenever they wish.

“Information obtained by DGI agents abroad can be passed to the

Soviet advisors.8 The five known are the following:
"El Frances" (The Frenchman), PINEIRO's personal advisor,
is apparently the chief Soviet advisor in Cuba. He bi

house, He was born between 1909 and 1914; is about five

hair; has blue eyes with bags under them; and wears at all
times gold-framed glasses with small-to-medium round lenses.
His Spanish is fairly good, Ie has a car assigned by the
Cuban government and drives it himself.

b. A Soviet man, name unknown, accompanies “El Frances." Ke
is five feet eight inches tall, is of medium to thin build,
woighing about 145 pounds, and is clean shaven. An officer
who saw him frequently at DGI headquarters never heard him

speak,

“Juan,” who shares an M Building office with "Bl Frances”
but works principally in the Illegal Department, is the
consultant on illegal operations, directs the recruitment
and handling of agents, arranges their entry and cover, and
maintains files. At one tine he spent about six months in
France; the general. impression is that he was there as an
illegal resident rather than in the Soviet Fmhassy. He
speaks excellent Spanish with very little accent and ap-
parently has known the language a long time. He too has a
car assigned by the Cuban government and drives it hinself.
Ho was born between 1919 and 1924 and is an active, athletic
man, about six feet tall and weighing a husky 200 pouads,
with b.ce eyes. Ho looks young, although his hair is grey,
as is the short-clipped mustache he wears low on his lip.

Of the eight departments making up the headquarters three are
operational, four are concerned with operational support or
training. and one is administrative, The three operational de~
partments are Legal Centers (Centros Legales - 35). Illegal
(ticgal). and National Liberation (Liberagt Ton Nacional - LN);

the fast two were formerly a single department, known as MA
Cintelligence), All three departments handle operations abroad
for the purpose of collecting information on the host country,
promoting Cuban political aims, and conducting subversive ac-
tivities, Their operations are distinguished by two factors,
legal connections and Communist Party-leftist group liaison.

The Departacot of Legal Centers is responsible for operations
conducted through Cuban official missions in countries with which
Cuba has -@iplomalic relations and has normally nothing to do with
illegal agents. The other two departments handle illegal agents,
both an countries with which Cuba has relations and in those with
which she has none, The Illegal Department has no connection
with Communist Parties or organized leftist sroups abroad; the
National Liberation Department deals mainly with such parties
and groups; the Department of Leyal Centers may work with them
gr unilaterally. All three departments are organized in geo-
traphical divisions with area desks for each country within
ieee yespective fields or responsibility; there is thus some
overlapping in desk coverage.

seat and the National Liberation Department, but each perso

requires. Field station chiefs report directly to PINETRO, but
administration goes through other channels, as explained below,

In all legal field stations. the DGI representative is charged
with keeping track of. checking. and reporting on the political
activities ‘of the other members of the mission to which he is
attached. DGI officers also assist with the political classes ,,
and lectures held periodically for members 6f the mission, but
this is a task shared by all mission members and is not assigned
to any officer specifically. Physical security, such as techni-
cal examination of Cuban premises for audio surveillance devices,
is not a DGI responsibility; 1t 1s performed by the DSE.

In countries with whick Cuba does not have diplomatic relations,
DGI activities are handled by agents stationed permanently in ~
the country as illegal agents$_or as members of Communist Parties
and leftist groups. Their assignments are sabotage. subversion,
selection and training of guerrilla warfare candidates and other
agents or groups in Latin America primarily. The DGI regards

Guatemala and Venezuela as the countries in which its operations
have been most successful. Such fzeld operations are run fron.

Operational Support Departments.

The operational support departments of the DGI are Technical
Operational Support (MI), Illegal Centers ). Special Schools
(EE). and‘Information Services (SI) They handle such functions
as spotting prospective agents, providing operational information,
training both intelligence agents and guerrillas. providing clan-
destine communications between headquarters and agents in the
field, procuring operational funds and supplies, etc.

The Department of Illegal Centers (Departamento Centros Ilegales -
NOY. The department is not, as its name implies, concerned Wit
operation of illegal field stations. but is an information col-
lection and agent candidate spotting department. It has three
major responsibilities: collection of information from foreigners
visiting Cuba; assessment of visiting foreigners for candidates
for intelligence agents; and screening of letters from abroad
volunteering info tion, both to extract any useful data and to
assess the writers as possible candidates for intelligence use.
Among visiting forcigners, the MO Department does: not concern it~ +
self with diplomats, they are left to the DSE. nor with foreigners
who are established residents of Cuba. who are the responsibility
of the Colonial Bureau (see below). In debriefing foreign visi-
tors, the department often works through ICAP, which makes arrange-
ments for many visits to Cuba: in many instances, the visitors
supply information unwittingly and are never aware that they are
in contact with Cuban intelligence. The MO Department does not
itself recruit agents; it only watches for, screens, and evaluates
foreign contacts as agent candidates. If the persons it selects
are members of a Communist Party or leftist organization, they
are referred to the LN Department: if they are not members of
such groups. they ave referred to the Illegai Department; one

of those two units does the actual recruiting.

jools (Departamento Escuelas

The Department of Special

Especiales - EE). This department is responsible for t¥aining
in guerrilla warfare and related subjects. It is headed by Luis

PIREZ, pseudonym “Bruno Diaz," who is a DGI officer but also a
captain in the Cuban Army. He has a deputy, pseudonym
"Aristides": an office assistant, pseudonym “Armando”; and a
courier, pseudonym "Garcia." The department staff, numbering
more than 50. is made up.entirely of Cuban Army personnel on
indefinite assignment to the DGI; they are directed by the DGI
but continue to be paid by the Army, which also provides all sup-
port for the department. The main office of the EE Department,
which is mainly administrative, is a residence at 178th Street
and and 31st Avenue, telephones 21-8426 and 21-8262,° in the
Barandilla section of the Marianao suburb of Habana. Training
is conducted at permanent school sites in Habana {none outside),
including guerrilla warfare schools at 310 51st Avenue. in the
Country Club district, and three in the Marianao subur' one
in the western part of the Arroyo Arenas section, one in the
western part of the San Agustin section, and one in the area
bounded by 214th and 226th Streets and 7th and 15th Avenues in
the Biltmore section. In addation there are technical training
schools (Escuctas Entrenaniento Tecnico) on East Street between
Parque and 37th Stree in the Alturas del Vedado section of
Habana, where Venezuelans and Salvadorans have been trained,

xo Spanish title, only NY.) This department 26 basically re-
sponsible for training individual intelligence agents and pro-
viding then technical operational support such as clandestine *
Communications systems, false documents, Ctc.} it also provides
technical support to, DGI staff members. The department chief is
Guillermo ARASTAGUIA, “pseudonym "Ree," who was formerly the sec-
retary of Ramiro VALDES. There are about 80 employees, including
a main office staff consisting of a secretary. pseudonym "Mayra';
two assistants. pseudonyms "Carmen" and “Maria Antonia"; and an
administrative officer, pseudonym “Victor.” The ME Department
seceives requests for training or support from the operational
departments; gives the training or provides or arranges for the
Support outside the operational department framework; and con-
tinges to process technical communications for the departments
after the agents have gone into the field. It has, however,
nothing to do with the dircction of agents; it is only a training
pnd support mechanism. The MI Department also does not supply
equipment, for example, for clandestine radio communication,

but tells agents what to procure and lets <hem make their own
purchases in their home countries with funds supplied by the
operational department directing them. As the main technical
department of the DGI, MI has most of the directorate's tech-
fieal equipment, which it services and repairs in its own es-
taplishment, the buildings within the M Building compound, ALL
kinds of professional technicians and semi skilled laborers are
available for such duties; they are all Cubans.

The MI Department has five sections, with the following
respunsibilities:

a. Chemical Laboratory ‘(Laboratorio Quimico — LQ) - LQ, which
ia headed by pscudonym "Contreras," provides chemical
ie uper writing systems and any other type of communications
or operational support requiring chemical action or analysis.
Qithough it supplies agents the systems or devices, it does
not train agents, but forwards the mater al to the training

country where the DGI operates or plans to operate. The
operational and other departments evaluate information they
acquire and send to the 10 Section of the SI Department what-
ever they think useful; the IO Section issues no formal re-
quirements. Most of the information comes from the Ilegal

information. The [0 Section sometimes debriefs staff members
returning from foreign tours or short trips for operational
information or data on foreign governments, but it does not
debrief agent trainees arriving in Cuba. It has one other
