SUBJECT Review of Selected Items in the
Lee Harvey OSWALD File Regarding Allega-
tions of CASTRO Cuban Involvement in the

John F. KENNEDY Assassination

REFERENCE : Letter by David W. Belin to
Mr. E. Henry Knoche, 15 April 1975,
paragraph 3 (Regarding Public Statement
by CASTRO, etc.), attached

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,
Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in
Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal
interview by the Associated Press correspondent,
Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. [There can be no question from the
facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been
expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this
event represented _a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a
message on the record in the United States.


13-00000

ft . ’

> “ SECRET ~

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of
topics but dealt principally with American political
leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-
coriated in extraordinarily provocative fashion
(® ... KENNEDY is a cretin;" " ... the BATISTA of his
times ... the most opportunistic: American President of
all time ..."). i

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary
reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing
the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in
the replay by United States newspapers like the
New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that
CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided
until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER story
appeared in the principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune,
on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-colunn head-
line: “CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders
Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the
HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) ~ Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of .

Cuba."


13-00000

t : C

SECRET

"Bitterly denouncing what he called
recent U.S. prompted raids on Cuban terri-
tory, Castro said: ‘We are prepared to
fight them and answer in kind. U.S. leaders
should think that if they are aiding terror-
ist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, they
themselves will not be safe."

" ,.. World affairs ... seemed to be
entering a more peaceful climate a few days
ago, but now this trend has changed with
attacks.

“The U.S. is always ready to negotiate
and make promises which later it will not honor.
This has happened to promises made during the
October crisis. They have been broken as can
be seen with new attacks.

"'But I warn this is leading to a very
dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's .

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference
to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real
significance. “The Washington Post did an abbreviated re~
write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted
any reference to the main ‘thrust of CASTRO'S remarks.

~ Phe Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed. the HARKER
story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the
paper (9 September 1963, page B-4) and reworded the content
of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-
litical aspects - in particular, highlighting the. GOLDWATER
elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States
leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY
assassination that this CASTRO interview was considered in
following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission
and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed
Headquarters attention to the AP story very shortly after
the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears
to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-
eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence
in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission
staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview
in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no
evidence in the files that anything along these lines was
stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's
request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the
assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know
from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results



13-00000

of the review, admittedly heavily using the 20--.20 quality

of hindsight, may be stipulated in summary:

a. There is no increment of credible
evidence, applying this phrase strictly, of
Soviet and/or Cuban political, intelligence
or security service involvement in the as-
sassination to what was developed and con-
sidered by the Warren Commission and its
staff. The Commission's finding that .
Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of
President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and did
them in alone and of his own determination
stands.

b. "Credible evidence" that would
upset or significantly modify this judgement
did (and does) not exist in Washington. But
such evidence could exist in Moscow and/or
Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the Warren
Commission wére minimal in quantity and
quality, designed to cover up any admissions
of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD
which might be related directly or indirectly
with the assassination. Therefore, the belief
that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB and/or
DGI) connection with OSWALD will persist and

by these governments of all elements of
OSWALD's handling and stay in the Soviet Union

CASTRO'S Cuba, DELGADO was probably the closest peer group

member to OSWALD during his specialist training period
at El Toro Marine Corps Base December 1958 - September 1959.
The Warren Commission Report takes note of this:

"OSWALD told DELGADO that he was in
touch with Cuban diplomatic officials in
this country, which DELGADO at first took
to be 'one of his lies, but later
believed. '"2

10. Actually DELGADO! s testimony says a lot more of
possible operational. significance than is reflected. by the
language of the report, and its implications do not appear ©
to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,
the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with
the Cubans starts with a question mark.

1l. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban
xelations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at
the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu-
larly keen about how to get to the island. DELGADO testi-
fied:

that OSWALD had at that time with the Cuban
Consulate?

"Mr. DELGADO : I did; because I thought it
funny for him to be receiving a caller at such a
late date - time. Also, up to this time he
hardly ever received mail; in fact he seldom
received mail from home because I made it a
policy, I used to pick up the mail for our unit
and distribute it to the guys in there, and very
seldom did I ever see one for him. But every so

12. OSWALD's application to Albert Schweitzer College,

Churwalden, Switzerland, was dated 19 March 1959, and he

was presumably to report there on 20 April 1960. Destined

accelerated his exit on grounds of family hardship in early
September 1959. “on 27 September 1989 he was issued a
U.S. passport valid for travel - among other places to
Cuba and the USSR. He entered the Soviet Union from
Finland on 15 October 1959.

13. DELGADO's testimony has the cast of credibility.
Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention
on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp
and talked with him for between one and a half to two hours.
The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually
there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else
we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before
or after his return to the United States. The record reflects
no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-
tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.
Assuming that, the questions are: Who was it, and was
there reporting from Los Angeles to Washington and Havana
that could, in effect, represent the opening of a Cuban

penetration dated 5 January 1962 describing events at the
yearly Communist Party cell meeting. The cell leader,
Morse BENITEZ Zabola, said that the Communist Party in
Guatamala should form a single new party; "We need not
preoccupy ourselves over the politics of President KENNEDY
because we know, according to prognostications, that he
will die within the present year, 1962."

15. This report apparently had been discounted when
it was received and was not forwarded until the Station:
xe-reviewed all of its material after the assassination.
The file reflects no follow-up or formal dissemination
of the report.

ENIGMATIC THREATS BY CUBAN THIRD SECRETARY IN THE anybe,
7 NOVEMBER 1963

16. A sensitive source, reporting after the

KENNEDY assassination, indicated that at the Soviet reception
on 7 November 1963, the Cuban Third Secretary,
Ricardo L. SANTOS Pesa, discussed the recent refugee raids
on Cuba and their implications with a host-country diplomat,
concluding with the admonition: " .., Just wait and you
will see what we can do. It will happen soon." Asked to
be more specific what would happen soon,’ SANTOS replied:
"Just wait, just wait.”

17. These data were passed to the Warren Commission
by memorandum, 31 March 1964. SANTOS was reported to have

from The Hague reportedly for reasons related to that fact
in April 1966.

INTERCEPTED CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE,
LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OP 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18. At 1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the
KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named
"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-
tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest
news. “Luisa” jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew
it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and
now, that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians! ..."

‘20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the
assassination, "“Luisa" also stated that the party at 7
Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear
that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would
they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she
said she planned to move that night into the house of a
doctor (a woman) friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion
of foreknowledge? This is the only item in the intercept
coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation.

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

a. “Luisa” was probably identical with
Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban
Directorate General of Intelligence (DGI).

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported
to be working in DGI Headquarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the
fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz
who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally
as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE
(departed $ November 1963). The deputy DGI
chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL's successor)
was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

ce. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's
conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican
national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known
visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban
installation§ in connection with a Cuban visa
application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the
Mexican Governmental authorities. A direct

confrontation with her was requested by the
Warren Commission staff but rejected by the

Mexican authorities. It is from Silvia DURAN's x
statements that it was learned that OSWALD

became engaged in a personal altercation on
27 September with Eusebio AZCUE.

d. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

alias Marcos, and his DGI assistant,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively
identified in February 1964 by two independent
sources as engaged in the active development
and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan
agents for the purpose of assassinating

General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, it is estab-
lished, was’ on post in Mexico City during
OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October ~
1963. He left Mexico city on 3 November 1963
for Havana. It was reliably reported ‘about
VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally
or illegally, had to pass through him first. He
took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba
for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days.>

For example, VEGA would have handled the details of the
visa action and facilitation of the trip to Cuba via
Mexico City from 28 December 1962 - 21 January 1963 that

23. here is no evidence in the OSWALD case file that
Silvia DURAN was subjected to a systematic elicitative
interrogation that would have related her dealings with
OSWALD, known or confirmed by intercept, with the data held
on the Cuban DGI, its personalities and methods, in :
Mexico City. Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,
considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the
applications to be handled solely by a local employee and
a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the
DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they
were not asked at the time. And there remains the more
fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its
face, could it have happened without the knowledge and
participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This
seems unlikely especially because VEGA is later cited by
a Cuban DGI defector as having stated he was aware OSWALD
made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear
CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security service could

have more in its files than was surfaced in the DURAN

was taken by Vincent Theodore LEE, the organizer of the
Fair Play Committee for Cuba, with which OSWALD established
relations from Dallas during the period 19 April -

2 November 1963. There is an overlap between LEE's and
VEGA's travels to Havana during that period: VEGA
departed Mexico City on 6 January for Havana and returned
on 13 February 1963. L is

Luisa CALDERON - as a member of the DGI unit in Mexico City -
could very well have known something that would make what
she said to her unidentified caller less a matter of
boastful self-indulgence than was assumed at the time.
SILVIA DURAN, SUBSTANTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ADMISSION OF
ALLEGED PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD, 1967

24, The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia DURAN
testimony already have been suggested above. (In that
context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider
the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations
on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,
and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquim Hernandez ARMAS,
because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-
tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about for been
offered?) money payments by her Mexican interrogators.)

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her
Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN
was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have
cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967, of
how she had been taken into custody and had been interrogated
after the assassination repeated what was already known.
She added, under circumstances that did not permit. the
source to challenge or elicit corroborative detail, that

and claimed she had sexual relations with him.

ALLEGATIONS OF CONSPIRATORIAL CONTACT BETWEEN OSWALD AND
CUBAN GOVERNMENT AGENTS WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO
ALLEGATIONS OF (A) ELENA GARRO DE PRAZ AND

26. .As the Warren Commission reported, “Literally
dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial contact between

OSWALD and agents of the Cuban Government have been

hundreds of CIA man-hours in Headquarters and abroad -

and similarly the FBI in the United States - was the

27. The ALVARADO case is taken up in detail by. the
Warren Commission under the cryptograph "D."7 ALVARADO

Mexico city. ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the
use of the polygraph, on which ALVARADO showed evidences of
deception, and by bringing ALVARADO's former Nicaraguan
security service control into the case.

28. ‘The ALVARADO story is a particularly acute repre-
sentation of the difficulties that beset the evaluation of
observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist
despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,
whose account did not become public until the release of
the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of
the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro
with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena GARRO de Paz is a mecurial, articulate and
socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated
from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She
is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN, the husband of
Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal
antipathy between the two women descending from
Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communism.

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall
of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently
kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's
account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the
Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,
including a repeated reference to a Negro with.red-dyed hair.

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in
a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964:
“Elena GARRO [said] that she and her
daughter were invited to a party at the Cuban
Embassy during the period she now finds out
that OSWALD was here in Mexico prior to the
assassination: She was invited by a Mexican
secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband
is a cousin of the GARRO family [Horacio DURAN].
At the party she saw three Gringos, not
drinking, not mixing and more or less just
standing around together like three bumps on a
log. They were so obviously out of place that
she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about
“them and was told that ‘they were just passing
through." She claims that on the way these
three Gringos stood out she took a good look
at them as did her daughter. When the
assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was
spread into the newspapers, both Elena and
her daughter immediately said that he was one
of the three Gringos 'without a doubt’ at the
party."
32. GARRO repeated her story to Mr. Charles William
THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on 10 December 1965:

Negro man with red hair [emphasis added]. In November 1963
when the identity of the assassin became known, she and
her daughter went to the Cuban Embassy and shouted
"assassins" and other insults at the staff there.® shortly
afterward, she and her daughter were visited by a friend,
Manuel CARVILLO [or CALVILLO], then an official in the
Secretariat of the Gobernacion and were told he had orders
to escort them to a small and obscure hotel in the center
of town. They were kept there for eight days under pretext
that they were in’ danger. When she told CARVILLO she wanted
to go to the American Embassy and explain what she knew of
OSWALD, she was told that the American Embassy was full of
Communist spies.

in certain particulars significantly modified her earlier
account, She also acknowledged that she and her daughter
had been interviewed by Embassy officers to whom she claimed
they did not give a very complete story because the
Embassy officers did not appear to give much credence to _~
anything they said.

34. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been
interviewed by the Legal Attache on 17 and 24 November 1964.
Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her
account to THOMAS but had not been substantiated by inquiries.
The FBI representative therefore considered the matter closed
and reaffirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA
Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador
on 25 February 1965. .

35. The Embassy Political Officer, however, persisted in
his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation,
13 July 1966, GARRO identified the place. to which she had been
taken by CALVILLO as the Hotel Vermont. (This detail checked
out affirmatively. GARRO was at the Hotel 23 ~ 24, 25 - 27
and 28 ~ 30 November 1963.) In another, on 7 February 1967,
GARRO's continuing vicissitudes with the Cubans are set out.
And finally, upon THOMAS's retirement from U.S. Government
service, the Department of State, at his request,

28 August 1969, disseminated to CIA and FBI a compilation of
his reporting of the Elena GARRO interviews.

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the
events she described as having occurred in the Mexican capital
in September 1963 never coincided with the confirmed data
of OSWALD's presence there. Her story, however, had two
points congruant with allegations by others regarding
OSWALD:

a. ALVARADO's allegations regarding the
Negro with the red-dyed hair [this detail could,
however, have been gleaned from the
Warren Commission's published account of the
"p" case] and

b. Silvia DURAN's later claim of
intimate personal contacts with OSWALD.

37. Beginning in March and amplified in May 1967, the
American Consul, Benjamin J. RUYLE, in Tampico developed a
contact with a local Mexican journalist,

Oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered
OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the
University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38. In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA
officer:

He studied law at the University of Mexico
for three years, approximately 1960 - 1964. He
belonged to: a clandestine pro-CASTRO revolutionary
group at the University. Regarding the OSWALD

case he was extremely cautious and although he
was not able or willing to give dates and

names, he said OSWALD visited the University

of Mexico campus shortly after the Cuban
Embassy refused him a visa to visit Cuba.

OSWALD made inquiries regarding pro-Cuban
revolutionary groups at the University and

was directed to CONTRERAS and his friend.
OSWALD met CONTRERAS and four other persons

as they came out of a round-table discussion
held in the faculty of Philosophy. OSWALD

told the group it was urgent that he visit

Cuba and the Cuban Embassy had denied him a
visa. He requested aid from CONTRERAS' group.
CONTRERAS and others mistrusted OSWALD because
they felt he was a CIA provocation. The group
allowed OSWALD to accompany them the rest of the
day, that night and part of the next day. OSWALD
was very introverted and appeared to be slightly
crazy. OSWALD made no mention of an assassination
plot but kept bringing up the point he had to
travel to Cuba immediately.

39. At this point, with FBI knowledge, the matter was

turned over to the Mexican authorities who determined that

CONTRERAS was indeed at the University of Mexico but only

for the years 1959 - 1960 and that he had been publicly
associated in protest activity for the Student Revolutionary
Bloc (BER) in January 1961. However, the group ceased
functioning as such in the middle of 1962, and i
Oscar CONTRERAS was never one of its leaders. No further
work is reflected in the files on the CONTRERAS allegations.
Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about
his own presence at the University, there is an additional
element that undermines the credibility of his account:
OSWALD's Spanish, which was barely adequate to get him meals
near the hotel, seems hardly likely to have permitted him to
carry on for an extended period with a University student

group.
