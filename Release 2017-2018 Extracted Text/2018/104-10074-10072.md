Response to Call-in to Agency Meadquarters/Initial Contact (Yelephone)
with John Daniel Williamson, Carrollton, Georgia

1. On 7 January 1975 Albert $. Coleman of tha Washington Field
Orfice called us to pass on information that he had just been given by

DCD Headquarters, regarding a call received by the Agency

duty officer on New Year's Eva from one John Daniel Williamson of
Carrollton, Georgia. Williamson identified himself as a Methodist
minister and gave his address as Rowte #2, Box 3646, Carrolitoa,
Georgia, Phone: (404) 854-8443,

2. In his call to Agency Headquarters, Williamson said that he had a
friend who had inforsatton on the impending overthrow of a foreign sovern-
ment. The information regarded illegal shipment of arms from the US to
the foreign country. Williamson said that bis friend bad wanted to try te
sell tha information to the foreign country concerned but that when the
friand told Williamson about it Williamson prevailed on tim te let him
(Williamson) bring it to the attention of the proper government agency,
resulting in his call to our headquarters on New Year's Eve. Williamson
asked that aomeone froa the Agency ba put in contact with him.

3, On the afternoon of 7 Jamary 1975, after verifying through the
phone operator thar Williemaon waa liated in the Carreliton area (he
tually lives at Roopville, Georgia, on Tyua Road, but tha Reepville
puones are handled under the Carroliten exchange}, we called his number.
We were informed by a young male voice, apparently his son, that Williamson
was indeed a Mathedist minister, but that he taught school every day during
the week in the high school at Pranklin, Georgia, except on Saturdays when |
he worked all day at a hardware store at Rockmart, Georgia. We were told
that he praached on Sunday mornings. We were not told what he does on
Suoday afternaonsa. Since he was not to be et home umtil after 5 ee
called him from our own home that some evening.

4, Williamson aeemed to be expectiag our cali although va had
identified ourselves during the eariler call. He gave us essentially
sama information furnishad during his lew Year's Eve call. Ha said that
the friend about whom ha called is a “former parishioner and lives in tha
Carrollton area.” Ue preferred not te provide us with the friend's vane
and address. The informacion, however—-that which we were abla to
aaceztain--soundad on the up-and-nup, as far as Me. Willdemsou's part in it
was concerned, for be seemed to be a siacexe and well intentioned individ-
wsen we tried to at least learn the name of the foreign country

5. Wa did learn that the friend whom Williamson deseribed as a
business consultant. ‘a kind of a high-finance nan involved in
setting up corperations,’ who often travals abroad, had been approached
by someone "locally, i.¢., in the Carrolltoa-West Atlanta area
(Carrollton is about 40 miles west of Atlanta). The friend waa said to
be “a good friend. a reliabde man, a college graduate, an established
ran in the conmumity.” According to Willdameon, the friend was
approached because of the nature of his work to perform some sort of ©
task for the group, and he “knew that somathing was wrong.’ The friend
then learned all bs could about the planned operation and eventually
talked with Williamson about it. The friend told Williamson that the
gun-running operation had been going on for about a yaar.

6. At one point Williamson said that hia friend told him that
“the people involved in this thing won't hesitate to kill him (the
friend) and he knows that he's going to have to leave this part of the
couatry when it comes to light.’ Williamson told ua: “I feel like I'va
got this nan’s life in my hands and I don’t wamt to do anything to
jeopardize his life, because I know him and his family and all.” :
Vilitamson suggested that wea meet his friend at tha Cape and Sword Motel
restaurant on I-20, near Six Flags Over Georgia, west of Atlanta, and
be said that the two of them had already talked of this as a good
meeting place, We told Williamson that we vould be glad to acet with
his friend but first we would like for his friend to give ue a call seo
that we nay talk with him. We gave our office phone mumber to
Williamson. As of the writing of this memorandum, we have had no cali.

7. From the information that Williamson provided, e.g., location
vf people involved, an attempt to meet with an Agency representative
{to possibly get us involved merely by association), we believe that much
of the substance of the matter could be the same as that which vas
veported from this office to OSS as related by Stephen Van Cleave
regarding Miteh Werbell, et al. (Sea ATL-39-74, 28 February 1974,
Resume of Contacts with Stephen Van Cleave; ATL-53-74, 9 April 1974,
Stephea Van Cleave.) Hiteh Warbell's operation, which hag been :
degeribed locally as a “machine-gun factory,” is locatad at Powder Springs,
Georgia, about ten miles north of the I-20 Capa and Sword Motel. At aay _
rate, Yr. Williamson's friend has been given the opportunity te contser us—
and we are awaiting his call. :
