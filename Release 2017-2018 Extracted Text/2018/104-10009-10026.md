MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT? "American Defectors to the USSR"

1, The attached material was part of a soft file entitled
“American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR/6
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components
until ca, 1963, The compilations were derived from a variety
of sources, and contain both classified and overt data,

|
{ 2, Inthe fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI
H Staff, In most instances, basic “information was then abstracted
“| for the US Defector Machine Program, In all instances in which
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
| a copy of this memorandum,

3. It is suggested that any dissemination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have already been made through the US Defector
Machine Program,
