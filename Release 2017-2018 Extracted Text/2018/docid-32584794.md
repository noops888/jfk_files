In reference to the verification of the birth of the

subjeet

as shown in the report of SA JAMES J: FILES dated

December 26, 1957 at Chicago:

Investigator JOHN. J. BURKE, Immigration and Naturalization

service: (INs), Chicago,

advised that he concluded that SAMUEL

GIANCANA was

born at Chicago.

Illinois on May 24, 1908, based

on birth certificate 5915 and Baptismal records of Holy

Guardian Angel Church.

These records both reflect the

birth of a son to the subjeet's parents on May 24, 1908.

Even though there is a discrepancy in the names, BURKE

believes this discrepancy arose from the fact that the

birth certificate was filed by

a midwife some time after

the event.

The delayed certificate filed by the subject in 1957,

also varies, but BURKE pointed out that a routine check

of the Bureau of Vital Statistics records at Chicago would

not have disclosed certificate 5919 and that undoubtedly

subject's lawyer located this only after having submitted

affidavits supporting the delayed certificate.

advised that INS has closed its deportation case on the

strength of the above verification of birth.

Arrangements have been made to monitor the account

of the subject at the Oak Park National Bank on a monthly

basis.
