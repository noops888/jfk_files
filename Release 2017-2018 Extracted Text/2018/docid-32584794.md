In reference to the verification of the birth of the
subject as shown in the report of SA JAMES J. FILES dated
December 26, 1957 at Chicago: -"

Investigator JOHN. J., BURKE, Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS), Chicago, advised that he concluded that SAMUEL
GIANCANA was born at Chicego, Illinois on May 24, 1908, based
on birth certificate 5915 and Baptismal records of Holy
Guardian Angel Church, These records both reflect the i
birth of a son to the subject's parents on May 2), 1908.

Even though there is a,discrepancy in the names, BURKE
believes this discrepaycy arose from the fact that the
birth certificate was filed by a midwife some time after
the event.

The delayed certificate filed: by the subject in 1957,

also varies, but BURKE pointed out that a routine check

of the Bureau of Vital Statistics records at Chicago would
not have disclosed certificate 5919 and that undoubtedly
subject's lawyer located this only after having submitted
the affidavits supporting the delayed certificate. BURKE
advised that INS has closed its deportation case on the
strength of the above verification of birth.

Arrangements have been made to monitor the account
of the subject at the Oak Park National Bank on a monthly
basis.

Regarding information furnished by CG 5951-C in

May, 195, as was reported in re report under the caption
T-9 on page 15, this informant was recontacted by SA ‘ROBERT
J. DENEEN on February 7, 1958. She advised that in using
the worg "syndicate" when discussing the positions of TONY
ACCARDO, TONY CAPEZIO and SAM GIANCANA in. May, 1954, she
could have had in mind no more exact meaning than that which
isin general use by the newspapers. That is simply that

a smalir group of individuals seem to dominate vice in :
general. in the Chicago area. The informant stated the use
of the worl "syndicate" was not meant to indicate ‘that #he
could positively state that there is any formal organization
