SOVIET TRADE ACTIVITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL WEST

Within a week after the
central committee approved
Khrushchev's plan for the chem-
ical industry, Soviet traders
apparently had their instruc-
tions and budget allocations

, and were renewing their activ—
ity in trade circles of the in-
dustrial West.

Contracts for fertilizer
installations, plastics and syn-
thetic plants, petrochemical
equipment, and mining machinery
are already i i f
report they have under consider-
ation a proposal by a West Ger-
man consortium to supply the
USSR with $400 million worth of
petrochemical equipment. A
Soviet mission is negotiating
with the British Imperial Chem-
ical Industry (ICI), which here-
tofore has supplied the USSR
with technical know-how. ICI
reportedly has offered to de-
liver equipment and processes
for the production of fertiliz-
ers, herbicides, rubber chem-
icals, and plastics. Negotia-
tions also are under way for
large numbers of Japanese chemi-
cal fertilizer plants.

Another Western consortiun,
involving US equipment and proc-
esses, is discussing delivery
of a large oil refinery. In
addition, contracts for a wide
range of other machinery and
equipment will probably soon be
signed. These contracts appar-
ently had been postponed until
the new chemical equipment buy-

ing program was presented to
the plenum and allocations for
various trade corporations for
next year were approved.

The Soviet need for addi-

tional credit to finance planned
expanded purchases is crucial.
The USSR presumably can generate
sufficient funds to meet down
payments on sizable orders.
However, credit arrangements
must be set now to spread out
the heavy crush of payments
which otherwise would fall due
in 1965-66 when equipment con-
tracted for next year will be
delivered.. Soviet ability to
increase hard-currency reserves
is not likely to improve in the
near future. Moscow's current
grain imports will reduce its
gold reserves by 25 percent.
If these continue beyond mid-
1964, the Soviet hard-currency
position will be under further
strain.

Despite the bleak foreign
exchange prospects for the USSR,
Soviet officials appear hopeful
that Western competition for
Soviet orders will be adequate
to foster Western governmental
and banking opinion favorable
to more and longer term credit.
Moscow may also hope that a
continuation of its relatively
restrained foreign policy will
be helpful in this context.
While viewing the USSR as an
acceptable commercial risk, the
banking community has hereto-
fore been unwilling to extend
credits beyond a five-year pe-
riod because of uncertainty
about future political develop-
ments. (SECRET)

CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERS'

With two weeks of their pro-
jected two-month tour of Africa
completed, Chou En-lai and For-
eign Minister Chen Yi can claim
high marks for their efforts to
project an aura of Afro-Asian
amity and to identify Peiping
with African aspirations. There
is no evidence, however, that
they have scored any comparable
success in the political or eco-
nomic fields.

The joint
on 21 December

communiqué issued
at the conclusion
of the Chinese leaders’ visit to
Cairo contains few surprises,
and reports from Algiers suggest
that discussions with Ben Bella
are following predictable lines.
Thus far the Chinese have at-
tempted to minimize differences,
play up past contacts, and press
such themes as militant struggle
against colonialism and "US im-
perialism,."

In both Algiers and Cairo,
Chou's hosts sought to demon-
strate their nonalignment by
actions designed to play down
the impact of the Chinese lead-
ers'arrival. Chou was greeted
in Cairo with a 2l-gun salute,
but Nasir was not on hand. In
Algeria, Ben Bella was on hand
to greet his guests, but the top-
level delegation he sent to the
Soviet Union just before Chou's
arrival is receiving more pub-
licity than the Chinese guests.

It has become increasingly
apparent that a major objective
of the trip has been to undercut
Soviet influence throughout the

continent. Criticism of the
USSR was reportedly a recurrent
theme in Chou's four lengthy
talks with Nasir. Nasir report-
edly said that Chou talked about
the USSR the way the Soviets
used to talk about the US, He
accused the Soviets of trying

to colonize China, of breaking
political and economic promises,
and of becoming tools of the

US, and he warned that any Afro-
Asian country which became de-
pendent on Moscow would suffer
the same fate as Peiping.

In Algeria, Chou sounded a
similar note. He cited China's
early support for Algerian rev-
olutionaries--support which ac
tually pre-dated that of the USSR.
He has also undoubtedly scored
Soviet unreliability. The Chi-
nese may be pressing the Algerians
to use some of the $50-million
credit offered in October. This
offer was made to counter a $100-
million Soviet credit offered
earlier the same month.

Sino-Soviet rivalry for
African support also flared at
the UN, where Peiping outmaneu-
vered Moscow on the question of
enlarging the representation in
principal UN organs to accommo-
date the African bloc. Soviet
delegate Fedorenko had attempted
to make it appear that the Chi-
nese were opposed to the African-
sponsored expansion plan because
they insisted that any change
in the UN be tied to Peiping's
own admission to the Security
Council. The USSR found itself
holding a suddenly emptied bag,

Page 2

TOP-SECRET DINAR

HW 55355 DocId:32401338 Page 8


however, when Peiping loudly
repudiated Fedorenko's statement
and accused the Soviets of using
the issue as a pretext for op-
posing Afro-Asian demands.

Chou can be expected to
capitalize on this during next
week's visit to Morocco and in
subsequent stops in Guinea,

Ghana, and Mali. No details of
Chou's itinerary beyond Rabat
have been made public by Peiping. |

EAST GERMAN REACTION TO RELAXATION

Reaction of East Germans
to the agreement to let West
Berliners visit relatives in
East Berlin is hopeful but still
fairly cautious, judging by re-
ports from local party officials.

The party central head-
quarters, obviously concerned
that the agreement might have
domestic repercussions, ordered
district officials to submit
immediate reports and detailed
follow-ups on reactions to this
partial relaxation of travel
curbs imposed in connection
with the building of the Berlin
Wall. Most of the responses
state that the people are elated
but are publicly voicing hope
that they may be permitted to
visit their relatives in West
Berlin and West Germany. Many
East Germans express hope that
the present move will be followed
by other relaxations--a reaction
probably quite unpalatable to
the regime.

Public comment--at ‘least-
as reported by the various

27 Dec 63

Such secrecy may well be prompted
by ‘security considerations. Chi-
nese officials were apparently
seriously shaken by the abortive
plot to kill Liu Shao-chi in
Cambodia last spring. The Chi-
nese envoy in Cairo reportedly
told Nasir of concern for Chou's
safety and asked that travel
plans during the Chinese leader's
visit to the UAR not be made

party headquarters--is still
fairly cautious: One party
member in Magdeburg said: "The
reason we don't let our citizens
go to West Germany is that we
are afraid they will defect."
But he was promptly silenced by
comrades who parroted the party
line on "the terror against our
GDR citizens in West Germany."

Public expression of dis-
satisfaction with harsh travel
and internal controls has been
recurrent in recent months,
reaching a peak prior to the
20 October parliamentary elec-
tions.

The people's reaction to

“the pass agreement with West

Berlin points up one of the re-
gime's major problems: how to
project an image of itself as a
sovereign state and of East Ber-
lin as its capital without in-
creasing discontent among its
population, who still risk shoot-
ing if they attempt to escape

to West Berlin. (SECRET KIMBO)

versary, on 20 December, of the
Viet Cong's Liberation Front,
despite. advance Communist propa-
ganda exhortation for a major
military effort. The Viet Cong
continued to direct attacks and
harassing activities primarily
at strategic hamlets.

South Vietnam's new govern-
ment is Showing extreme sensi-
tivity to discussion of a "neu-
tralist solution” to its in-
surgency problem. The Communists’
Liberation Front has repeatedly
proposed such a settlement, and
the idea is gaining new advocates
as a result of Cambodia's call
for an international conference.
Saigon's military rulers last
week closed down a newspaper
which was expressing interest in
neutralism. However, editorials

though attacking neutralism, have
kept the debate in the public eye.
On 20 December, Saigon students--
possibly encouraged by the re-
gime--demonstrated against neu-
tralism. :

On the military front, the
government is beginning to take
some steps to overcome the leth-
argy that has affected its coun-
terinsurgency effort since the

program has been launched in one
of the most troublesome provinces
inthe northern part of the coun-
try, and broad command changes
have been introduced in two prov-
inces south of Saigon where
security has been deteriorating.

members of the civilian advisory
Council of Notables. Returned
exiles apparently are not rep-
resented, and there is a dearth
of direct provincial represen-
tation. Many appointees, how-
ever, are. prominent political,
professional and lay religious
leaders who could provide effec-
tive guidance to the regime if
they are given a chance.

Apathy and disenchantment
over the new government are wide-
spread among such key elements
as middle-grade officers, stu-
dents and politicians. Criti-
cism centers on the lack of
firm direction by the ruling gen-
erals, on repeated reshuffling
of local officials deemed in-
competent, corrupt or close to.
the Diem regime, and on the rise
in Viet Cong activity. There
are signs that junta members
themselves are beginning to share
the disillusionment of some cir-
cles with Premier Tho's provi-
sional cabinet, which is described
as ineffective and regional in
outlook.

Leading generals nevertheless
seem to have few effective steps
in mind to rally popular support.
Three generals recently complained
to US officials that they were hav-
ing trouble finding qualified
Vietnamese to fill government posi-
tions and that press criticism
of their efforts was unhelpful.
General "Big" Minh, the chief of
state, has indicated a personal
distaste for a prominent role,
and has asserted that the people
would gradually come to appreciate
the new government as problems
were solved on a province-by
province-basis. (SECRET NO FOR-

Communist forces have

reportedly supported by sub-
stantial numbers of North Viet-
namese, on 19 December captured
Kam Keut and the nearby airfield,

Right-wing messages have de-
scribed a key rightist parabattal-
ion as "completely smashed."
Communist units have advanced

ist positions. along Route 8-A,
but there have been no indica-
tions that they intend to press
their advantage by a major drive
on Nhommarath, which is still
held by rightist forces. In
other areas, there have been
reports of only limited activ-
ity, involving scattered skir-
mishes and artillery exchanges.

Meanwhile, neutralist and
Pathet Lao representatives are
continuing their efforts to
negotiate an easing of tensions
between the two factions. At

a meeting on 20 December in the
Plaine des Jarres, both sides
called for an "early" meeting
between Premier Souvanna and
Prince Souphannouvong. They

also agreed, in principle, that
elements of the coalition govern-
ment should be transferred from
Vientiane to the royal capital

at Luang Prabang, which would be
neutralized and placed under tri-
partite control. Both factions
reiterated their support for

the formation of a mixed police
force in a neutralized Vientiane.

General Phoumi's right-
wing faction, which was not
represented at the meeting,
remains skeptical of Pathet
Lao intentions. Phoumi apparently
believes that an agreement for
the neutralization of Luang
Prabang is unlikely, but he may
join in talks on the subject.

He has indicated, however,that
the neutralization of Vientiane
is contingent on the willingness
of the Pathet Lao to allow free
movement in areas of Laos now

FRENCH CABINET MINISTER TO VISIT CAMBODIA

Armed Forces Minister
Pierre Messmer's visit to Cam-
bodia from 4-7 January is de-
Signed primarily to strengthen
French influence there in the
wake of Prince Sihanouk's call
for an end to the US aid pro-
gram. Messmer's high-level
entourage, which includes the
chiefs of the Foreign Ministry's
Indochina and Cultural and Tech-
nical divisions, will probably
recommend some increases in aid,
but De Gaulle apparently has
no intention of taking on any
large new commitments.

French-grant aid to Cam-
bodia since 1956 has amounted
to only $15 million. Current
assistance is threefold: a
military training mission of at
least 250 men; cultural aid in
the form of a university mission
and 319 teachers in Cambodian
schools; and the maintenance of
about 40 experts in the fields
of health and public works. In
addition, a number of French
nationals hired by the Cambodian
Government hold positions of
considerable influence in the
Ministry of Finance, the Treas-
ury, and the premier's office,
and are among Prince Sihanouk's
advisers.

Paris has indicated it has
no intention of equaling the

in military aid probably would

be limited to reconditioned and
obsolete equipment, such as
trucks and light armored vehicles.
Increased cultural and technical
assistance probably would include
further help for the French uni-
versity mission, more teachers,
and 30 or 40 additional technical
experts, especially agricultural-
ists.

The extension of French aid
will be complicated by Cambodia's
claims for compensation for
losses incurred as a result of
the 1958 devaluation of the
French franc. Since 1958 France
has asserted that a large-scale
aid program would be impossi-
ble until there is agreement on
an exchange rate, but a compro-
mise may now be in sight.

Sihanouk has sought French
help in maintaining Cambodia's
policy of neutrality, and in
recent talks with the US andthe
UK, France has supported his
call for an international con-
ference on Cambodian neutral-
ity, despite US objections.
Indeed, De Gaulle has consist-
ently sought to meet Sihanouk

ARABS PLAN NO OVERT ACTION AGAINST ISRAELI PROJECT

The Arab states evidently
do not plan any overt military
action against Israel when in
late January or early February
the Israelis begin pumping tests
for their Jordan River diversion
project, but sabotage of the
project's facilities may be at-
tempted.

The Arab military chiefs
who met in Cairo in mid-December
apparently decided that direct
military attacks are not feasi-
ble. The chiefs reportedly
agreed, however, that the states
bordering on Israel should
mount independent and uncoor-
dinated clandestine operations.

The Arab League Defense
Council, which meets in January,
probably will approve this rec-—
ommendation, but its implementa-
tion is another matter. Egyp-
tian, Jordanian, and Lebanese
officials have indicated pri-
vately that their governments
have no intention of taking
aggressive action of any kind
against the Israeli project.

Nasir, however, told the
Canadian ambassador in early
December that he was worried
that Syria might act unilater-
ally and present the other Arab

states with a dilemma. Damascus
will be under strong pressure
to fulfill its threats against
the Israeli scheme, particularly
in view of the close proximity
of the Syrian border to Israel's
pumping station on Lake Tiberias.

Nasir's wariness about be-
coming involved in a war with
Israel over Jordan waters was
also evident in a speech he
made on 23 December. He empha-
sized that the problem is polit-
ical rather than military in
mature and that the chiefs of,
staff cannot solve it. He
called for a summit meeting of
Arab presidents and kings to
seek a solution.

considers there is

an outside possibility that
Syria might bomb or shell the
pumping facility's transformer
station. However, the Israelis
believe the primary threat stems
from former Palestinians now
living in Syria, Jordan or
Lebanon, who might make a dra-
matic effort to sabotage the
project even though they prob-
ably could not cause serious
damage. (SECRET NO FOREIGN

Fighting between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities,
which began on 21 December and
was continuing on 26 December
despite efforts to obtain a cease-
fire, is the culmination of a
steady growth of tension on the
island during the past few weeks.
The new tension followed Presi-
dent Makarios' presentation to
Turkish Cypriot leaders of propos-
als for changing the Cyprus con-
stitution. The proposals, which
essentially involved removing the
guarantees to the Turkish minor-—
ity that had been written into
the Cyprus settlement of 1959,
were rejected by the Turkish Gov-
ernment even before the Turkish
Cypriots had made their views
known.

Most of the initial fight-
ing appears to have been between
Greek Cypriot police and the Turk-
ish underground, and to have taken
place in the Turkish areas of Nic-
osia.. The situation there de-
teriorated progressively during
the week, as the police lost con-
trol to extremist groups of ir-
regulars from both communities.

A cease-fire, to be supervised
by the British, had not been ef-
fective as of the morning of 26
December. Fighting had also con-
tinued at the port city of Lar-
naca; the rest of the island was
quiet but tense.

In the face of these de-
velopments, the Turkish Govern-—
ment threatened to exercise its
right under the 1959 agreement
to intervene on Cyprus. Three
Turkish jet fighters flew over
Nicosia on 25 December, and
Turkish naval units appeared off
the island. Part of. the 650-man
Turkish garrison on Cyprus left
its barracks to move into one
of the Turkish quarters of the
capital. Part of the 950-man
Greek contingent then moved to
protect Greek areas, The situa-
tion evidently prodded Athens
and London into a more active
role, and Greek, Turkish and
British forces on Cyprus have
been placed under a unified Brit-
ish-led command. Britain has an-
nounced it is sending 150 ad-
ditional troops.

The violence may make lead-
ers of both sides more cautious
in pressing political demands.
Soon after the outbreak, Makarios
told the US ambassador he would
go more slowly in pushing his con-
stitutional revisions, Both eth-
nic groups, however, will be fur-
ther embittered--particularly
the Turkish community, which
is believed to have suffered
much the heavier casualties.

THE COMMON MARKET CRISIS

The Common Market appears to
have averted disaster for the sec-
ond time in less than a year. The
eleventh—hour agreements reached
on agricultural policy on 23 De-
cember are apparently sufficient
to discourage De Gaulle from carry-
ing. out his threat to break up the
community. Moreover, the Germans
and Dutch succeeded in extracting
limited commitments from Paris on
EEC participation in the Kennedy
Round of tariff negotiations. These
agreements donot cover all the out-
standing issues, however, and the
manner in which they were reached
will leave a residue of bitterness.
Nor is it certain that major US
interests have fared well.

The main agricultural elements
in the "package" deal are the reg-
ulations concerning intracommunity
trade in beef, rice, and dairy prod-
ucts and the rules governing the
community farm fund, Their effect
is to open the large West German
market to farm exports of France,
Italy, and the Netherlands--gen-
erally at a substantial advantage
over the exports of nonmembers. Al-
though approval of these and the
financial regulations is an im-
portant step forward, the key ques-
tion of grain price unification is
still unsettled. Further considera-
tion of the formula proposed by Com-
missioner Mansholt has been delayed
until next year.

The agreement on a Kennedy
Round position is likewise an ad-
vance for the community, but from
the US view not necessarily favor-
able. On the long-standing problem
of tariff "disparities," the EEC
adopted a formula which would
exempt from the proposed 50-per-
cent linear reduction in tariffs
a far larger-number of items than
the US hoped for, The EEC position

URRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY REVIEW

on farm products in the trade ne-
gotiations--although an improvement
over the initial Mansholt propos-
als--also leaves much to be desired
from the US view. In general, the
EEC proposes that, if its levy sys-
tem operates in such a way as to
cause difficulties for the exports
of nonmembers, then the EEC Commis-
sion will be called on to propose
“appropriate, but unspecified,
measures. These would not apply

if it is technically impossible to
determine how much protection is
actually involved in the levy sys-
tem,

The general relief within
the community which greeted these
agreements reflects both the
depth of the crisis and some op-
timism that the Common Market's
unity may have been restored. The
prominent role played by the
EEC's commission in achieving
the compromise has in particu-
lar encouraged those who hope to
strengthen the community's in-
stitutional structure.

In France the conviction
was evidently widespread, how-
ever, that both Bonn and The
Hague were quite prepared to see

ket, and in the event of its
breakup, to seek alternative
ties with the Outer Seven. More-
over, while it may prove healthy.
that Bonn "stood up" to De Gaulle
in this instance, its motive was
strongly colored by a desire to pro-
tect its inefficient farmers, Nor
does it augur well for US~EEC re-
lations that the French blame the
US for much of the opposition
they encountered. (SECRET NO

WEST GERMAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

The opening of the Berlin
Wall during the holiday season
and the death of Social Demo-
cratic Party (SPD) chairman
Erich Ollenhauer have placed
Willy Brandt once again in the
center of the German political
stage.

The agreement to open the
Wall resulted from Brandt's un-
ceasing efforts to ease condi-
tions for Berliners. His will-
ingness to reach agreement with
the East Zone authorities on
the pass issue is being criticized
by some Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) leaders and by the
CDU-oriented press in West Ger-
many. Brandt, however, is bank-
ing on the expectation that most
West Germans, like the Berliners,
will approve his action. He
has even hinted that there may
be further negotiations with the
East Germans to extend the period
of the passes beyond the 5 Jan-
uary cutoff date. There is also
speculation that both East and
West Germany will find the pass
agreement a model for agreement
on other issues.

Brandt, who was the most
logical choice, was named acting
chairman of the SPD immediately
after Ollenhauer's death on 14
December. Deputy Chairman Her-
bert Wehner has proposed that

27 Dec 63

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY REVIEW

Europe

Brandt's position be formalized
at a special party convention
next month. Fritz Erler, the
party's foreign and defense
expert, is slated to take
Brandt's place in the hierarchy
as second deputy chairman. As
the SPD leader, Brandt would
stand to be candidate for chan-
cellor in the 1965 general elec-
tions. If current opinion polls
are any indication, the SPD
will give the CDU a strong race
in that contest.

Brandt, however, has not
yet committed himself, since
to accept the SPD chairmanship
might require him to resign as
mayor of Berlin and move to Bonn
In so doing he would have to
operate at a distance from his
political bastion.

Whatever Brandt decides,
the SPD is bound to miss the
conciliating influence of Ollen-
hauer, who was able to hold
together the often highly
antagonistic factions of the
party. Brandt, with his ideas
of greater flexibility in
foreign policy, may be expected
to clash more frequently with
Wehner, who--despite his Com-
munist past--has come to rep-
resent the SPD's right wing.

NATO: The NATO ministe-

ended on 17 December, avoided
serious discussion of the more
contentious issues facing the
alliance. There was, for in-
stance, only passing reference
to the matter of nuclear shar-
ing. While NATO's military
posture was generally recognized
as still inadequate, the Force
Planning exercise--which is
designed to help correct this
situation--was not discussed
at all. The dispute over basic
strategy, the chief stumbling
block to the exercise, was put
off until after De Gaulle's
press conference.sometime in
January.

All but the French agreed
that the alliance should explore
possibilities of negotiating
with the Soviets on outstanding
East-West issues. The Germans,
as usual, indicated some reser-
vations because of their sensi-
tivity regarding Berlin and Ger-
man reunification. The question
of restricting Western credits
to the Soviet bloc was reserved
for future consideration. (SE-

Iceland's near general
strike was settled on 21 Decem-
ber when labor and management
agreed to a 25-percent wage in-

page was led by Communist-dom-
inated unions seeking, as in
the past, to force the resigna-
tion of the Conservative - So-

discrediting its economic poli-
cies. The settlement is regarded
as a political victory for Prime
Minister Benediktsson's govern-
ment, since the Communists were
unable to maintain a solid grip
on labor.

The settlement, however,
will intensify inflationary
pressures and will probably
force Benediktsson to take ex-

economic stability. For polit-
ical reasons he will try to avoid
another currency devaluation,
but it is doubtful that the

without resorting to this meas-

DOMESTIC POLITICS IN CUBA

Fidel Castro is continuing his
effort to reduce the influence of
the veteran Communists who were lead-
ers of the Moscow-oriented, pre-rev-
olutionary Communist party of Cuba.
Castro's campaign against them,
launched in a bitter attack in March
1962, subsequently seemed to lose
steam, Recent reports from knowl-
edgeable clandestine sources, how-
ever, indicate that the old liners
are again on the defensive and are
likely to suffer further in govern-
ment Shake-ups which may be in the
offing. Castro nevertheless con-
tinues to move slowly in order to
avoid undue disruption within his
regime,

The only major veteran Commu-
nist figure to remain in Castro's
good graces is Carlos Rafael Rod-
riguez, the head of the National
Agrarian Reform Institute. Rod-
riguez' position has actually been
strengthened in recent weeks with
the raising of his job to cabinet
level. He has evidently convinced
Castro of his personal loyalty and
of his ability as an administrator.
It is also possible that Rodriguez
performs a useful and trusted liai-
son role between Castro and Soviet
leaders. He returned to Havana on
22 December after a two-week trip
to the USSR and several Soviet satel-
lites where, according to press ac-
counts, he was in contact with high-
ranking Communist Party officials.

The old-line Cuban Communists
remain strong, according to a re-
cent clandestine report, in the in-
termediate and lower echelons of
the military and party hierarchies.
Wherever possible, they continue

their "sectarian" efforts to secure
positions for their comrades at the
expense of Fidelistas. A clandes-
tine source reported hearing "ru-
mors" in high regime circles late
last month that veteran Communists
have banded together in clandestine
cells to work against Castro

Che Guevara continues to be the
Cuban leader most openly critical of
the Soviet Union and the most insist-
ent on the "necessity" of accelerat-—
ing the revolution in Latin America.
Fidel Castro is said to agree with
Guevara's position, but awareness of
Cuba's own self-interest still com-
pels him to be more cautious in pur-
suing policies that could be inter-
preted as anti-Soviet. It neverthe-
less remains a key regime policy to
encourage Communist revolution in
Latin America.

A clandestine source who is a
high-level Cuban diplomat asserts
that Cuban leaders privately recog-
nize that popular discontent with
the regime is widespread. He claims
however, that they are confident
their unpopularity has reached its
nadir, and that they are beginning
to make up lost ground. They ex-
pect, for instance, that economic
difficulties--a major source of
discontent--will be largely over-
come within three years. The strat-
egy of the government, this source re-
ports, is to hold on untii the econ-
omy improves and until Cuban subver-
sive efforts elsewhere in Latin
America result in the establishment
of one or more Communist allies in
the hemisphere. Then, the regime
feels, it will be secure. (SECRET NO

DOMINICAN REGIME FACES NEW POLITICAL CHALLENGES

The killing of 15 guerrillas
by Dominican Army troops on 21
December apparently removes the
last pocket of insurgents op-
posing the government. However,
the incident could provoke dan-
gerous political repercussions,

the brutal and unnecessary kill-
ing of the insurgents, includ-
ing the president of the pro-

Group. The army commander of
the area in which the incident
took place insists the deaths
were the unavoidable result of
a fire fight. If stories of

file Dominicans, who recall the
repressive measures of former
dictator Trujillo

among civilian and military
elements. Only the prompt ap-
pointment of Foreign Minister
Donald Reid to the vacant post
in the triumvirate appears to
have helped avert a serious
political crisis for the moment.

The triumvirate has asked
the cabinet--which was chosen
from and is responsible to six
minority political parties--to
resign to permit the appoint-
ment of a more independent group.
This move has promnted strong
protests from four of the splinter
parties backing the regime, who
stand to lose patronage; the
outcome is unclear.

However, the National
Civic Union, the only sizable
party in the government, backs
the cabinet reorganization.
More important, the key leaders
of the armed forces are provid-
ing the triumvirate with their
support, which could prove cru-
cial in a political showdown.

BRAZIL

Further changes in the Bra-
zilian cabinet are expected fol-
lowing the resignation last week
of Finance Minister Carvalho
Pinto. A moderate leftist, Ney
Galvao, was appointed Pinto's
successor, but there remains a
possibility that Leonel Brizola--
who had been actively pushed for
the post by the extreme left--
may eventually receive some min-
istry. There is widespread be-
lief in the army that War Min-
ister Jair Ribeiro will also be
replaced in the near future. As
one responsible Brazilian com-
mentator has remarked, with Gou-
lart "every minister is an in-
terim one."

Ney Galvao's appointment
actually reduces the previously
slight prospect that Brazil's
critical financial problems would
be handled effectively. Galvao's
qualifications in the economic
field are weak at best and his rec~
ord as head of the Bank of Brazil
aoes not command confidence with-
in the business community. Be-
fore taking his new post, he
served as minister without port-
folio in charge of coordinating
foreign trade policies, a job
he performed without any par-
ticular distinction.

Although his views are
perhaps somewhat to the right of

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY REVIEW

Western Hemisphere

Goulart's, Galvao can be expected
to toe the adminstration line
faithfully. Moreover, Galvao's
appointment may be a temporary
expedient designed to allay
fears that Brizola would succeed
Pinto. Galvao is a personal
friend of Brizola and there is
speculation that Brizola will,
in fact, eventually move into
the Finance Ministry.

The new finance minister
inherits almost insurmountable
economic and financial problems.
Chief among these are a rampant
inflation that may see the cost
of living increase 80 percent
this year, and a staggering
foreign debt involving approxi-
mately $1 billion in payments
due over the next two years.

The severity of the eco-
nomic situation and Goulart's
apparent intention to assume
greater personal direction over
financial policies increase
the possibility of radical meas-
ures that might be detrimental
to foreign creditors and in-
vestors. Goulart reportedly is
considering nationalization of
all public utilities and can-
cellation of mining concessions.
Measures such as these could
lead to further deterioration
of Brazil's economic position.
