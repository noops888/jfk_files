SOVIET TRADE ACTIVITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL WEST

Within a week after the

central committee approved

Khrushchev's plan for the chem-

ical industry, Soviet traders

apparently had their instruc-

tions and budget allocations

and were renewing their activ-

ity in trade circles of the in-

dustrial West.

Contracts for fertilizer

thetic plants, petrochemical

equipment, and mining machinery

are already in various stares of

ation a proposal by a West Ger-

man consortium to supply the

USSR with $400 million worth of

petrochemical

equipment.

A

Soviet mission is negotiating

the British Imperial Chem-

ical Industry (ICI), which here-

tofore has supplied

the USSR

technical know-how.

reportedly has offered to de-

liver equipment and processes

for the production of fertiliz-

ers, herbicides, rubber chem-

icals, and plastics. Negotia-

also are under way for

of Japanese chemi-

cal fertilizer plants.

Another Western consortium,

involving US equipment and proc-

esses, is discussing delivery

of a large oil refinery.

In

addition, contracts for

a wide

range of

other machinery and

equipment will probably soon be

signed.

These contracts appar-

ently had been postponed until

the new chemical equipment buy-

ing program was presented to

the plenum and allocations for

various trade corporations for

next year were approved.

The Soviet need for addi-

tional credit to finance planned

expanded purchases is crucial.

The USSR presumably can generate

sufficient funds to meet down

payments on sizable orders.

However, credit arrangements

set now to spread out

the heavy crush of payments

which otherwise would fall due

in 1965-66 when equipment con-

tracted for next year will be

delivered.. Soviet ability to

increase hard-currency reserves

is not likely to improve in the

near future. Moscow's current

grain imports will reduce its

gold reserves by 25 percent.

If these continue beyond mid-

1964, the Soviet hard-currency

position will be under further

Despite the bleak foreign

exchange prospects for the USSR,

Soviet officials appear hopeful

that Western competition for

Soviet orders will be adequate

to foster Western governmental

and banking opinion favorable

to more and longer term credit.

Moscow may also hope that a

continuation of its relatively

restrained foreign policy will

be helpful in this context.

While viewing the USSR as an

acceptable commercial risk, the

banking community has hereto-

fore been unwilling to extend

credits beyond a five-year pe-

riod because of uncertainty

about future political develop-

ments. (SECRET)

CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERS' AFRICAN TOUR

With two weeks of their pro-

jected two-month tour of Africa

completed, Chou En-lai and For-

eign Minister Chen Yi can claim

high marks for their efforts to

project an aura of Afro-Asian

amity and to identify Peiping

with African aspirations.

is no evidence, however, that

they have scored any comparable

success in the political or eco-

nomic fields.

The joint communiqué issued

on 21 December at the conclusion

of the Chinese leaders'

visit to

Cairo contains few surprises,

and reports from Algiers suggest

that discussions with Ben Bella

are following predictable lines.

Thus far the Chinese have at-

tempted to minimize differences,

play up past contacts, and press

such themes as militant struggle

against colonialism and "US im-

perialism."

In both Algiers and Cairo,

Chou's hosts sought to demon-

strate their nonalignment by

actions designed to play down

the impact of the Chinese lead-

ers'arrival.

Chou was greeted

in Cairo with a 21-gun salute,

but Nasir was not on hand. In

Algeria, Ben Bella was on

to greet his guests, but the top-

level delegation he

sent to the

Soviet Union just before Chou's

arrival is receiving more pub-

licity than the Chinese

guests.

It has become increasingly

apparent that a major objective

of the trip has been to undercut

Soviet influence throughout the

continent. Criticism of the

USSR was reportedly a recurrent

theme in Chou's four lengthy

talks with Nasir.

Nasir report-

edly said that Chou talked about

the USSR the way the Soviets

used to talk about the Us.

accused the Soviets of trying

to colonize China, of breaking

political and economic promises,

and of becoming tools of the

IS, and he warned that any Afro-

asian country which became de-

pendent on Moscow would suffer

the same fate as Peiping.

In Algeria, Chou sounded a

similar note.

He cited China's

early support for Algerian rev-

olutionaries--support which ac-

tually pre-dated that of the USSR.

He has also undoubtedly scored

Soviet unreliability.

The Chi-

nese may be pressing the Algerians

to use some of the $50-million

credit offered in October.

This

offer was made to counter a $100-

million Soviet credit offered

earlier the same month.

Sino-Soviet rivalry for

African support also flared at

the UN, where Peiping outmaneu-

vered Moscow on the question of

enlarging the representation in

principal UN organs to accommo-

date the African bloc.

delegate Fedorenko had attempted

to make it appear that the Chi-

nese were opposed to the African-

sponsored expansion plan because

they insisted that any change

in the UN be tied to Peiping's

own admission to the Security

Council.

The USSR found itself

holding a suddenly emptied bag,

The Communist World

however, when Peiping loudly

repudiated Fedorenko's statement

and accused the Soviets of using

the issue as a pretext for op-

posing Afro-Asian demands.

Chou can be expected to

capitalize on this during next

week's visit to Morocco and in

subsequent stops in Guinea,

Ghana, and Mali.

No details of

Chou's itinerary beyond Rabat

have been made public by Peiping.

Such secrecy may well be prompted

by security considerations.

Chi-

nese officials were apparently

seriously shaken by the abortive

plot to kill Liu Shao-chi in

Cambodia last spring.

The Chi-

nese envoy in Cairo reportedly

told Nasir of concern for Chou's

safety and asked that travel

plans during the Chinese leader's

visit to the UAR not be made

public. (SECRET NO FOREIGN DIS-

EAST GERMAN REACTION TO RELAXATION OF BERLIN TRAVEL

to the agreement to let West

as reported by the various

party headquarters--is still

fairly

cautious:

One party

member in Magdeburg said:

"The

reason we don't let our citizens

go to West Germany is that we

are afraid they will defect."

But he was promptly silenced

comrades who parroted the party

line on "the terror against our

GDR citizens in West Germany."

Public expression of dis-

satisfaction with harsh travel

and internal controls has been

recurrent in recent months,

reaching a peak prior to the

20 October parliamentary elec-

tions.

The people's reaction to

the pass agreement with West

Berlin points up one of the re-

gime's major problems:

how to

project an image of itself as a

sovereign state and of East Ber-

lin as its capital without in-

creasing discontent among its

population, who still risk shoot-

ing if they attempt to escape

to West Berlin. (SECRET KIMBO)

JEK Act 6 (1) (B)

NORTH KOREA IMPROVES AIR DEFENSE CAPABILITY

North Korea has recently

taken

several steps which signif-

icantly strengthen its air de-

fenses.

MIG-21 (Fishbed) jet

fighters, which were first de-

tected only at Pukchang-ni air-

field, now are being stationed

at other airfields.

Pyongyang

has also apparently just acquired

a large number of relatively

sophisticated types of radar

In addition, the North

Korean bomber force, which has

a total of about 100 IL-28

(Beagle) jet light bombers, is

in part now equipped with, and

has been training with, an im-

proved blind bombing and naviga-

tional system.

Testing of and

flight train-

ing with the new fighters--10

to 14 of which were apparently

obtained from

the USSR in the

fall of 1962--were first noted

in June 1963.

the MIG-21s have been detected

frequently in flight activity

involving ground controlled in-

tercept exercises.

Beginning in October, MIG-

21s have been noted operating

from Wonsan on the east coast

of North Korea.

Their deploy-

ment to this airfield places

supersonic fighters on both the

east and west coasts of North

Korea.

The North Koreans have re-

cently expanded their radar

coverage.

Six new types. of

radar, at least one of which

is believed to be exclusively

of Chinese Communist manufacture,

have been detected.

For the

present these radars will ap-

parently supplement rather than

replace North Korea's original

three types--Kniferest A, SCR-

270, and Token.

The identifiable new types

include Kniferest B,

Spoonrest

A, and a new type of Chinese Com-

munist origin which is probably

a substantial modification of

the SCR-270. Spoonrest A is

sometimes used as the acquisi-

tion radar for surface-to-air

missile

sites, but it is also

used in an early warning role

and is probably intended for that

use in North Korea. Acquisition

of these new radars reflects

North Korea's

efforts to extend

the range of its early warning

detection system. To improve

height-finding capability, Pyong-

yang has also introduced more

sophisticated radars such as

Rockcake and Stonecake.

Another improvement in North

Korea's air capability is the

equipment of about twenty IL-28s

with an improved blind bombing

and navigational radar system des-

ignated

Shorewalk.

When properly

used, this system permits preci-

sion navigation and blind bombing

without the use of ground communi-

cations which would betray the di-

rection of the flight and the tar-

get designation. (TOP SECRET DINAR)

ENTHUSIASM FOR SOUTH VIETNAM REGIME FLAGGING

Communist guerrilla activ-

ity increased only slightly in

connection with the third anni-

versary, on 20 December, of the

Viet Cong's Liberation

Front,

despite advance Communist propa-

ganda exhortation for a major

military effort.

The Viet Cong

continued to direct attacks and

harassing activities primarily

at strategic hamlets.

South Vietnam's new govern-

ment

is showing extreme sensi-

tivity to discussion of a "neu-

tralist solution" to its in-

surgency problem.

The Communists'

Liberation Front has repeatedly

proposed such a settlement, and

the idea is gaining new advocates

a result of Cambodia's call

international conference.

Saigon's military rulers last

week closed down a newspaper

which was expressing interest in

neutralism.

However, editorials

in the vernacular. press, even

though attacking neutralism,

kept the debate in the public eye.

On 20 December, Saigon students--

possibly encouraged by the re-

gime--demonstrated against neu-

tralism.

On the military front, the

government is beginning to

take

some steps to overcome the leth-

argy that has affected its coun

terinsurgency effort since the

A long-range pacification

program has been launched in one

of the most troublesome provinces

in the northern part of the coun

try, and broad command changes

have been introduced in two prov-

south of Saigon where

security has been deteriorating.

In the political field,

the government has named 60

members of the civilian advisory

Council of Notables.

Returned

exiles apparently are not rep-

resented,

and there is a dearth

of direct provincial represen-

tation.

Many appointees, how-

ever, are prominent political,

professional and lay religious

leaders who could provide effec-

tive guidance to the regime if

they are given a chance.

Apathy and disenchantment

over the new government are wide-

spread among such key elements

as middle-grade officers, stu-

dents and politicians.

Criti-

cism centers on the lack of

firm direction by the ruling gen-

erals, on repeated reshuffling

of local officials deemed in-

competent, corrupt or close to

the Diem regime, and on the rise

in Viet Cong activity.

are signs that junta members

themselves are beginning to share

the disillusionment of some cir-

cles with Premier Tho's provi-

sional cabinet, which is described

as ineffective

and regional in

outlook.

Leading generals nevertheless

seem to have

few effective steps

in mind to rally popular support.

Three generals recently complained

to US officials that they were hav-

ing trouble finding qualified

Vietnamese to fill government posi-

tions and that press criticism

of their efforts was unhelpful.

General "Big" Minh, the chief of

state, has indicated a personal

distaste for a prominent role,

and has asserted that the people

would gradually come to appreciate

the new government as problems

were solved on a province-by

province-basis.

been

reports of

only limited

ity, involving scattered skir-

mishes and artillery exchanges.

Meanwhile,

neutralist and

Pathet Lao representatives are

continuing their efforts to

negotiate an easing of tensions

between the two factions.

At

a meeting on 20 December in the

Plaine des Jarres,

both sides

called for an "early" meeting

between Premier Souvanna

an d

Prince Souphannouvong.

They

also agreed, in principle, that

elements of

the coalition govern-

ment should be transferred from

Vientiane to the royal capital

at Luang Prabang, which would be

neutralized and placed under tri-

partite control.

Both factions

reiterated their support for

the formation of a mixed police

force in a neutralized Vientiane.

General Phoumi's right-

wing faction, which was not

represented at the meeting,

remains skeptical of Pathet

Lao intentions.

Phoumi apparently

believes that an agreement for

the neutralization of Luang

Prabang is unlikely, but he may

join in talks on the subject.

He has indicated, however, that

the neutralization of Vientiane

is contingent on the willingness

of the Pathet Lao to allow free

movement in areas of Laos now

FRENCH CABINET MINISTER TO VISIT CAMBODIA

Armed Forces Minister

Pierre Messmer's visit to Cam-

bodia from 4-7 January is de-

signed primarily to strengthen

French influence there in the

wake of Prince Sihanouk's call

for an end to the US aid pro-

gram.

Messmer's high-level

entourage, which includes the

chiefs of

the Foreign Ministry's

Indochina and Cultural and Tech-

nical divisions, will probably

recommend some increases in aid,

but De Gaulle apparently has

no intention of taking on any

large new commitments.

French-grant aid to Cam-

bodia since 1956

has amounted

to only $15 million.

Current

assistance is threefold:

military training mission of at

least 250 men; cultural aid in

the form of a

university mission

and 319 teachers in Cambodian

schools; and the maintenance of

about 40 experts in the fields

of health and public works. In

addition, a number of French

nationals

hired by the Cambodian

Government hold positions of

considerable influence in the

Ministry of Finance,

the Treas-

ury, and

the premier's office,

and

are amono Prince sihanouk's

advisers.

Paris has

indicated it has

no intention of equaling

the

US aid program.

Any increase

in military aid probably would

be limited to reconditioned and

obsolete equipment, such as

trucks and light armored vehicles.

Increased cultural and technical

assistance probably would include

further help for the French uni-

versity mission, more teachers,

and 30 or 40 additional technical

experts, especially agricultural-

ists.

The extension of French aid

will be complicated by Cambodia's

claims for compensation for

losses incurred as a result of

the 1958 devaluation of the

French franc.

Since 1958 France

has asserted

that a large-scale

aid program would be impossi-

ble until there is agreement on

an exchange rate, but a compro-

mise may now be

in sight.

Sihanouk has sought French

help in maintaining Cambodia's

policy of neutrality, and in

recent talks with the US and the

UK, France has supported his

call for an international con-

ference on Cambodian neutral-

ity, despite US objections.

Indeed, De Gaulle has consist-

ently sought to meet Sihanouk

more than half way,

and Paris

may now encourage Sihanouk

to press this issue.

ARABS PLAN NO OVERT ACTION AGAINST ISRAELI PROJECT

The Arab states evidently

do not plan any overt military

action against Israel when in

late January

or early February

the Israelis begin pumping tests

for their Jordan River diversion

project, but sabotage of the

s facilities may be at-

tempted.

The Arab military chiefs

who met in Cairo in mid-December

apparently decided that direct

military attacks are not feasi-

ble.

The chiefs reportedly

agreed, however,

that the states

bordering on Israel should

mount independent

and uncoor-

dinated clandestine operations.

The Arab League Defense

Council, which meets in January,

probably will approve this rec-

ommendation, but its implementa-

tion is another matter.

tian, Jordanian, and Lebanese

officials have

indicated pri-

vately that their governments

have no intention of

aggressive action of any kind

against the Israeli project.

Nasir, however, told the

Canadian ambassador

in early

December that he was worried

that Syria might act unilater-

ally and present the other Arab

states with a dilemma.

Damascus

will be under strong pressure

to fulfill its threats against

the Israeli scheme, particularly

in view of the close proximity

of the Syrian border to Israel's

pumping station on Lake Tiberias.

Nasir's wariness about be-

coming involved in a war with

Israel over Jordan waters was

also evident in a speech he

made on 23 December.

sized that the problem is polit-

ical rather than military in

nature and that the chiefs of

staff cannot solve it.

an outside possibility that

Syria might bomb or shell the

However, the Israelis

believe the primary threat stems

from former Palestinians now

Lebanon, who might make a dra-

matic effort to sabotage the

project even though they prob-

ably could not cause serious

damage.

CYPRUS DISPUTE FLARES AGAIN

Fighting between the Greek

and Turkish Cypriot communities,

which began on 21 December and

was continuing on 26 December

despite efforts to obtain a cease-

fire, is the culmination of a

steady growth of tension on the

island during the past few weeks.

The new tension followed Presi-

dent Makarios' presentation to

Turkish Cypriot leaders of propos-

als for changing the Cyprus con-

stitution.

The proposals, which

essentially involved removing the

guarantees to the Turkish minor-

ity that had been written into

the Cyprus settlement of 1959,

were rejected by the Turkish Gov-

ernment even before the Turkish

Cypriots had made their views

known.

Most of the initial fight-

ing appears to have been between

Greek Cypriot police and the Turk-

ish underground, and to have taken

place in the Turkish areas of Nic-

osia..

The situation there de-

teriorated progressively during

the

week, as

the police lost con-

trol to extremist groups of ir-

regulars from both communities.

A cease-fire, to be supervised

by the British, had not been ef-

fective as of the morning of 26

December.

Fighting had also con-

tinued at the port city of Lar-

naca; the rest of

the island was

quiet but tense.

In the face of these de-

velopments, the Turkish Govern-

nent threatened to exercise its

right under the 1959 agreement

to intervene on Cyprus.

Three

Turkish jet fighters flew over

Nicosia on 25 December, and

Turkish naval units appeared off

the island.

Part of the 650-man

Turkish garrison on Cyprus left

its barracks to move into one

of the Turkish quarters of the

capital.

Part of the 950-man

Greek contingent then moved to

protect Greek areas.

The situa-

tion evidently prodded Athens

and London into a more active

role, and Greek, Turkish and

British forces on Cyprus have

been placed under a unified Brit-

ish-led command.

Britain has an-

nounced it is sending 150 ad-

ditional troops.

The violence may make, lead-

ers of both sides more cautious

in pressing political demands.

Soon after the outbreak, Makarios

told the Us ambassador he would

go more slowly in pushing his con-

stitutional revisions. Both eth-

nic groups, however, will be fur-

ther embittered--particularly

the Turkish community, which

is believed to have suffered

much the heavier casualties.

THE TARIFF DISPARITIES ISSUE.

The tariff disparities issue which has plagued preparations for the Kennedy Round for many

months originates in the fact that there are substantial differences between the EEC and US:

tariffs on individual items, even though over-all tariff levels are roughly the same. Because

the EEC common external tariff was arrived at by averaging the tariffs.of the member states,:

the EEC tariff schedule is characterized by the absence of "peaks and lows!'; in the US schedule,

on the other hand, the rates vary much more, and some individual tariffs remain very high in

comparison with those of the EEC. Accordingly, the EEC and the French in particular have.

long insisted that a 50-percent cut in tariffs by both the US and the EFC would leave the US:

with substantial protection on certain items and deprive the EEC of bargaining power to effect

their future reduction*:

The disparities issue was believed to have been settled at the GATT ministerial meeting

last May with a formula which provided that tariffs on industrial items would in general be

reduced equally and across. the board, except that special rules would apply: "where sigs

nificant

adverse effects on trade would result from disparities in tarif levels In fact, how-

ever, this formula merely shifted the argument to the problem of determining what dispartfies

are "significant" or "meaningfül in trade terms." Because the "special rules" would mean in

most cases a smaller tariff reduction by the EEC than by the US, the EEC has attempted to

maximize the area to which these rules would apply while the US has sought to minimize their

application.

After lengthy negotiation, a GATT_subcommittee reached a considerable: measure. or

agreement last month on a formula which would identify a "significant" tariff disparity in

the first instance as one in which the high rate is al least 30 percent of value and at least

10 percent above the lower rate: Because this formula would identify some 850 US items as

eligible for "special trearment," the sub committee proposed seven additional qualitative cris

leria which would reduce considerably the number of eligible items The three to which the

US attaches special importance would. (i) require that there be substantial imports of the ilem

concerned from the high tariff country into the low, (2) exclude tems where there are sub

stantial imports into the high tariff country; and 3) exclude items on which the low tarit

country maintains quotas.

The formula approved by the EEC on 23 December would substitute for the 30, 10 criterion

9 2/1 formula. A disparity would be identified as one in which the high tariff is twice as

high as the low one, apparently with the additiona, qualification that le most cases here

would have to be a ten-point percentage spread between the two rates This formula would

provide for special treatment for far more than 850 items, including items of special US

export interest. The arrangements for qualitative criteria also seem to have been modified

to the US! disadvantage.

THE COMMON MARKET CRISIS

The Common Market appears to

have averted disaster for the sec-

ond time in less than a year.'

The

eleventh-hour agreements reached

on agricultural policy on 23 De-

cember are apparently sufficient

to discourage De Gaulle from carry-

ing out his threat to break up the

community. Moreover, the Germans

and Dutch succeeded in extracting

limited commitments from Paris on

EEC participation in the

Kennedy

Round of tariff negotiations.

agreements do not cover all the out-

standing issues, however, and the

manner in

they were reached

will leave a residue of bitterness.

Nor is it certain that major US

interests have fared well.

The main agricultural elements

in the "package"

deal are the reg-

ulations concerning intracommunity

trade in beef, rice,

and dairy prod-

ucts and the rules

community farm fund.

is to open the large West German

market to farm exports of France,

Italy, and the Netherlands--gen-

erally at a substantial advantage

over the exports of nonmembers. Al-

though approval of these and the

financial regulations is an im-

portant step forward, the key ques-

tion of grain price unification is

still unsettled.

Further considera-

tion of the formula proposed by Com-

missioner Mansholt has been delayed

until next year.

The agreement on a Kennedy

Round position is likewise an ad-

vance for the community, but from

Kent on

the US view

not necessarily favor-

able.

On the long-standing problem

of tariff "disparities," the EEC

adopted a formula which would

exempt from the proposed 50-per-

cent linear reduction in tariffs

a far larger number of items than

the US hoped for:

The EEC position

on farm products in the trade ne-

gotiations--although an improvement

over the initial Mansholt propos-

als--also leaves much to be desired

from the US view.

In general, the

EEC proposes that, if its levy sys-

tem operates in such a way as to

cause difficulties for the exports

of nonmembers, then the EEC Commis-

sion will be called on to propose

"appropriate," but unspecified,

measures.

These would not apply

if it is technically impossible to

determine how much protection is

actually involved in the levy sys-

tem.

The general relief within

the community which greeted these

agreements reflects both the

depth of the crisis and some op-

timism that the Common Market's

unity may have been restored. The

prominent role played by the

EEC's commission in achieving

the compromise has in particu-

lar encouraged those who hope to

strengthen the community's in-

stitutional structure.

In France the conviction

was evidently widespread, how-

ever, that both Bonn and The

Hague were quite prepared to see

the French "leave" the Common Mar-

ket, and in the event of its

breakup,

to seek alternative

ties with the Outer Seven. More-

over, while it may prove healthy

that Bonn "stood up" to De Gaulle

in this instance, its motive was

strongly colored by a desire to pro-

tect its inefficient farmers. Nor

does it augur well for US-EEC re-

lations that the French blame the

US for much of the opposition

they encountered.

UK-US FRICTIONS OVER SHIPPING POLICY

British shipping and offi-

cial circles are incensed over

recent US demands for informa-

relating to rate discrim-

ination against US exports.

The British Government has

vised against compliance on

the grounds that this informa-

tion is commercially confiden-

tial, and that the US cannot

demand what the UK Government

cannot obtain.

Following a recent con-

gressional investigation into

alleged rate discrimination

against American exports, the

US Maritime Commission asked

the North Atlantic Freight Con-

ference to explain the differ-

entials on a long list of items,

setting a 20 January deadline

for compliance under penalty

of heavy fines.

tion is that US exporters are

being penalized because outward

rates are higher on the average

than the inward rates.

British and

other shipping

lines regard the differentials

as economically justified.

The

tonnage of Us

exports is much

greater than import tonnage,

and

shipping lines--anxious

to

avoid half-loaded or in-ballast

westbound

voyages--have tradi-

tionally charged

lower rates

for items imported into the US

than for exports from this

country.

Thus, what are seen as

American efforts

to regulate

international shipping lines in

order to improve the unfavorable

US balance of payments have

caused increasing rancor in

Britain.

Before Parliament ad-

journed for its Christmas recess

on 20 December, some Conserva-

tive MPs

called for retaliatory

restrictions on US ships arriv-

ing at UK ports.

Although the

did not specify what re-

strictions they had in mind,

the government cannot afford

in the present pre-election

period to leave itself open

to charges that it is not atten-

tive enough to domestic interests.

The Douglas-Home government,

while hopeful of some compromise

before the 20 January deadline,

is busily lining up international

support.

At the recently con-

cluded

conference of transport

ministers of 10 European mari-

time nations, Britain proposed

that Japan be invited to join

the united front of European

maritime countries in a general

protest against US shipping

policies,

thereby aligning

roughly three quarters of the

world's shipping business against

the Us position. Japan agreed

to do so, and the collective

protest was filed with the

State Department on 23 Decem-

ber.

WEST GERMAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

The opening of the Berlin

Wall during the holiday season

and the death of Social Demo-

cratic Party (SPD) chairman

Erich Ollenhauer have placed

•Willy Brandt once again in the

center of the German political

stage.

The agreement to open the

Wall resulted from Brandt's un-

ceasing efforts to ease condi-

tions for Berliners.

His will-

ingness to reach agreement with

the East Zone authorities on

the pass issue

by some Christian Democratic

Union (CDU) leaders and by the

CDU-oriented press in

West Ger-

many.

Brandt, however, is bank-

ing on the expectation

that most

West Germans, like the Berliners,

will approve his action.

has even hinted that there may

be further negotiations with the

Last Germans to extend the period

of the passes beyond the 5 Jan-

uary cutoff date.

There is also

speculation that both East and

West Germany will find the pass

agreement a model

for agreement

on other issues.

Brandt, who was the most

logical choice,

was named

acting

chairman of the SPD immediately

after Ollenhauer's death on 14

December. Deputy Chairman Her-

bert Wehner has proposed that

Brandt's position be formalized

at a

special party convention

next

month. Fritz Erler, the

party's foreign and defense

expert, is stated to take

Brandt's place in the hierarchy

as second deputy chairman.

As

the SPD leader,

Brandt would

stand to be candidate for chan-

cellor in the 1965 general elec-

tions.

If current opinion polls

are any indication, the SPD

will give the CDU a strong race

in that contest.

Brandt, however, has not

yet committed himself, since

to accept the SPD chairmanship

might require him to resign as

mayor of Berlin and move to Bonn.

In so doing he would have to

operate at a distance from his

political bastion.

Whatever Brandt decides,

the SPD is bound to miss the

conciliating influence of Ollen-

hauer, who was able to hold

together the often highly

antagonistic factions of

the

party.

Brandt, with his ideas

of greater flexibility in

foreign policy, may be expected

to clash more frequently with

Wehner, who--despite his Com-

munist past--has come to rep-

resent the SPD's right wing.

DOMESTIC POLITICS IN CUBA

Fidel Castro is continuing his

effort to reduce the influence of

the veteran Communists who were lead-

ers of the Moscow-oriented, pre-rev-

olutionary Communist party

of Cuba.

Castro's campaign against them,

launched in a bitter attack in

1962,

subsequently seemed to lose

against chen arch

Recent reports from knowl-

edgeable

clandestine sources, how-

ever, indicate that the old liners

are again on the defensive and are

likely to suffer further in govern-

ment shake-ups which may be in the

offing.

Castro nevertheless con-

tinues to move slowly in order to

undue disruption within his

regime.

The only major veteran Commu-

nist figure to remain in Castro's

good graces is Carlos Rafael Rod-

riguez, the head of the National

Agrarian Reform Institute.

Rod-

riguez' position has actually been

strengthened in recent weeks with

the raising of his job to cabinet

He has evidently convinced

Castro of his personal loyalty and

of his ability as an administrator.

It is also possible that Rodriguez

performs a useful and trusted liai-

son role between Castro and Soviet

leaders.

He returned to Havana on

22 December after a two-week trip

to the USSR and several Soviet satel-

lites where, according to press ac-

counts, he was in contact with high-

ranking Communist Party officials.

The old-line Cuban Communists

remain strong, according to a re-

cent clandestine report, in the in-

termediate and lower echelons of

the military and party hierarchies.

Wherever possible, they continue

their "sectarian" efforts to secure

positions for their comrades at the

expense of Fidelistas.

A clandes-

tine source reported hearing "ru-

mors" in high regime circles late

last month that veteran Communists

have banded together in clandestine

cells to work against Castro.

Che Guevara continues to be the

Cuban leader most openly critical of

the Soviet Union and the most insist-

ent on the "necessity" of accelerat-

ing the revolution in Latin America.

Fidel Castro is said to agree with

Guevara's position, but awareness of

own self-interest still com-

pels him to be more cautious in pur-

suing policies that could be inter-

preted as anti-Soviet.

It neverthe-

less remains a key regime policy to

encourage Communist revolution in

Latin America.

A clandestine source who is a

high-level Cuban diplomat asserts

that Cuban leaders privately recog-

nize that popular discontent with

the regime is widespread.

He claims,

however, that they are confident

their unpopularity has reached its

nadir, and

that they are beginning

to make up lost ground. They ex-

pect, for instance, that economic

difficulties--a major source of

discontent--will be largely over-

come within three years.

The strat-

egy of the government, this source re-

ports, is to hold on untis the econ-

omy improves and until Cuban subver-

sive efforts elsewhere in Latin

America result in the establishment

of one or more Communist allies in

the hemisphere.

Then, the regime

feels,

it will be secure.
