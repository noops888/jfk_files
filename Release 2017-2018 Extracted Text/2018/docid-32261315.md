Interview: On May 9, 1978 Staff Investigators Joseph j. Basteri

and Albert Maxwell interviewed James Robert Todd in the offices

of his attorney Jerry Biesel. Mr. Todd states that he is self-

employed and heads the Todd Oil and Investment Co. Inc., located

at 6116 North Central Expressway, Dallas, Texas. (Tel:214/369-6585) •

Todd states that he was born in Groesbeck, Texas and came

to Dallas in 1939 and was arrested soon after as he was mistaken

for Henry Noble, a known criminal in the area. While in jail he

met Lois Green and their friendship continued until Lois Green

was killed by an unknown assailant on December 24, 1949.

While mention was made that Lois Green headed a gang that

was operating in and about the Dallas area, Todddid not subscribe

to this description of Lois Green. Todd states that the Green

gang is nothing but propaganda generated by the local press.

There was no such organized crime but only a group of fellows

who hung out together.: These men may have committed crimes

together but it was not under the direction of Lois Green.. A

few minutes later, while dening organized crime existed in Dallas,

he remarked that whenever

these persons to inform them that dallas is their territory

and for them to get out of town

and find their own territory.

Todd admitted that in the 30's and early 40's Dallas was

a wide open town until a reform district attorney by the name

of Will Wilson cleaned up the town.

To illustrate how he and Lois Green had no law enforcement

or political connections, Todd suggested we check their arrest

records which will disclose the countless times they had been

arrested for vagrancy. He pointed out that if anyone had any

connections they would certainly not be harrassed by the police

department in such a manner.

Todd answered that he does not know the following named

persons: Irwin Weiner, Lenny Patrick, Sam Yaras, Barney Baker,

Harry Hall, Alex Gruber, Ralph Paul, Robert Ray McKeown, Andrew

Armstrong, Tom Eli Davis III, William Cies, Harry Olsen and

James Braden. His answer as to his relationship with the fol-

lowing persons are:

Lewis McWillie - Only knew him as a crap player and gam-.

bler.

Never associated with him.

George Senator - Only knew him as a person who would sell

clothing; has bought: a few

suits from him.

George Butler - Only knew him as a police officer and he

was

always "tailing me."

Morgan Brown - Todd said he met him for the first time two

or three months ago in Dallas. The meeting concerns some

oil properties that a doctor friend of his invested

$30,000 in. After some negotations by Todd, Morgan re-

turned the $30,000 back to the doctor.

William Decker - Only knew him as a police. officer.

He

had a reputation of being a good, firm man. Word was

also out that Fritz

was not a man to fool around with.

Jettie Bass - He is dead now. Died of a heart attack a

few years ago. He was an Indian... Todd knew him as a

burglar.

Nick Cascio - Describes him as a very nice guy until some-.

one crosses him and then he could be very tough. Has

known him for 35 years.

Todd last saw him three or four

months ago and is in bad health with cancer. He said

Cascio was a burglar.

Angelo Thomas Casten -States he only knows him from the

Dallas area.

Hollis de Lois Green - Has known him since 1939 and lists

him as one of his best friends. He would not go into too

much detail as to what type association they had but only

constantly praised Lois Green

as being a "great guy."

Ray Brondo - A used car salesman; hasn't seen him in 25

years.

R.D. Mathews - Todd states he knew Mathews very well. When

we attempted to question him regarding any illegal acti-

vity he and Mathews were engaged in during the Green

Todd replied, "Let's just say we were social friends

and leave it at that."

James Henry Dolan - Only knew him as a casual friend.

Paul Roland Jones - Had known him for two or three years:

Did not know too much about him but questioned the fact

that Ruby associated with Jones.

Todd said that Jones

was not the type to have Ruby around him because of his

(Ruby's) association with the police.

Joe Bonds - Todd said he knew him as a night club operator

and that Lois Green was killed outside of Bond's night

club.

Campisi - Todd said he is just a guy who runs a restaurant.

Never associates with him but has eaten in his restaurant.

It must be noted that Todd was purposely vague about describ-

ing details of the persons that he was associated with. He also

would not go into too many facts concerning any illegal activi-

ties with the exception of admitting to two crimes that he had

committed. One was for the crime of homicide and the other was

a burglary. He was convicted and served time for both crimes.

The details Todd gave concerning his homicide arrest was as fol-

lows: Todd stated that on September 3, 1953, while seated in

, a restaurant, a man entered, and without any provocation, pro-

ceeded to cut Todd on the side of his throat and other parts of

his body. Todd ran outside, bleeding profusely, obtained a gun

from R.D. MATHEWS, fired one shot into the air to make certain

the gun was in working order and then entered the premises and

shot

said assailant to death. He

was arrested and served two

years for this crime. On November 22, 1961 he received a

• full

pardon for

this crime.

The other crime Todd admitted to was

when he was

arrested for burglary by throwing a rock through a

window and stealing $500 which he gave

to a friend who needed

the money.

Todd denied ever being engaged in safe cracking activities

although his arrest record discloses 4

_ arrests for transporting

explosives indicating the arrests may have been for carrying

• nitro, an explosive commonly used by safe crackers for blowing •

up safes.

Since the death of Lois Green in 1949 Todd said he began

to break away from what he was doing and decided to get a job.

He worked at different places until finally he went into the

oil business and has

been extremely successful.in that field.

Mr. Biesel, Todd's attorney, had quoted to us during an earlier

interview that Todd is now a millionaire. He heads the

located at 6116 North Expressway, Dallas,

Texas.

When asked about Sue's Used Car Lot, Todd replied that

he

was very familar with the place as he worked

there as a sales-

man for several years. The car

lot was operated by Sue Souther-

land who later married Harry Hammond. They are still married

and she is presently the Vice President of the Merchants Bank.

Todd

described Sue Hammond as an extremely honest person who

would never be involved in any dishonest act.

Todd denied

that the Sue's Used Car Lot was used as a hangout for his

cronies and that while there they planned illegal activities.

Todd denied these charges, explaining that the purpose he ob-

tained this job for was to offset the frequent arrests for va-

grancy that he was receiving from the Dallas Police Department.

He also would not allow any of his friends to use these premises

for a hangout out of respect for Sue Hammond as he knew she

would not approve of it and he did not want her to get into

trouble.

According to Todd, he does not remember what year or under

what circumstances he met Jack Ruby. He describes their asso-

ciation as being so casual that he really cannot recall any de-

tails of even when he last saw him. Todd could not explain or

understand how Ruby would have his phone number in his possession

as he does not believe he ever gave his phone number to Ruby.

Todd admits to being in the Silver Spur several times and had

visited the Vegas Club. He thinks he remembers Eva Grant as

being at the door of the Vegas Club. Todd strongly denied hav-

ing any dealings or associations with Ruby. He would explain

that when he met Ruby in the street he would exchange greetings

and continue: to walk as Ruby would always try to stop and engage

him in a social conversation. Todd characterized Ruby as al-

ways being in the police station on social calls and he wasi

extremely friendly with police officers. On the other hand,

Todd said he and his friends wanted nothing to do with police

officers and

stayed as far away from them as possible. Todd

could not conceive of Ruby being associated with anyone in-

volved in any criminal organization with him (Ruby) being so

closely associated with the police department. The fear was

always there that Ruby could be a police informant, so stated

Todd.

Todd answered the questions rather freely and we were never

cautioned by his attorney, Jerry Biesel, as to the type of

questions being asked. The interview ended with Todd suggest-

ing, if needed, we can

again call him and he would be willing

to speak to us again.
