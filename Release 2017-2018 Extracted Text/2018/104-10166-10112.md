i KEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Wil Diyision !

: SUBJECT : Meeting with Luis CONTE Agdero; :
Date: 2 Saptember 19: Aase

Officer:

1, A three hour meeting was held with Subject this
worning, The purpose of the meeting was to impress upon
Bubject the need to follow KUBARK direction concerning

the aftermath of recent developments in the Dominican
Republic,

2, Bubject reported the following: He talked by
bptoa canard on 31 August with McGeorge Bundy, Subject's
interpretation of this conversation was that McGeorge
Bundy invited him to come to Washington, He also stated
that he had asked Bundy to, arrange. for a meeting for him
with the President of the U. S. He did not explain to ae
Bundy the real purpose for wishing a meeting with the H '
President, All he told Bundy was that ho wanted to give
the President the original copy of Imbert's resignation, i '
What Subject really wants is to tell the President that ie
Imbert has a proposal for provoking an attack upon the
Cuban Government involving the Armed Forces of the
Dominican Republic. Imbert's personal message to the
President (which Subject is to convey) is that the
Dominican Armed Forces are ready to engage in war against
Cuba, if the Dominican Armed Forces have coy=zrt U.
support.

had not heard from Bundy, but he had heard from Robert A,
Stevenson cf ARA/CCA and he was te-moet with Stevenson
some time this afternoon, As for the meeting planned

offictaldom to be of real use. Similarly, Subject said
that he would not. reveal Imbert's proposal to McGeorge
Bundy, but would only deliver this proposal orally to
the President.

4, The Case Officer persuaded Subject to give him
a copy of the Imbert resignation (attached herewith with
photos and newspaper clippings) and told Subject that the
Case Officer would send these by messenger to the White
House and would inform the President that Subject has a
proposal to convey to the Prosident from Imbert. The
Case Officer impressed upon Subjoct that it was not at
all likely a meeting could be arranged with the President,
Finally, Subject said he would wait until tomorrow after-
moon or not later than Saturday and, if no meeting could
be arranged, he would return to Miami,

5, In the course of the conversation it became
apparent that Subject's personal reason for desiring a
meeting with the President is not so much to convey the
Imbert message but to have himsolf photog:aphed with the
President and to derive publicity which would enhance
Bubject's personal prestige among the members of the

exile Cuban community,

6, The Case Officer berated Subject, who responded
good naturedly, on his uncoordinated and unilateral
action as outlined above and told Subject that he was
only hurting his position with KUBARK, particularly if
it became known among newspapermen that he was a KUBARK
agent, Subject said he was sure this would not become
known and he could handle this aspect of the problem,
Subject also said that if his Case Officex in Miami was
unhappy with his behavior, Subject was willing to resign,
He said further he had just recently received an offer
for a combined radio/television program from a Caracas,
Venezuela station making an offer of $5,000 per month,
(Subject's KUBARK s.iary 18 $3,000 per month.)

7. Subject finally agreed that ha would coordinate
with the present Case Officer in Washington prior to
any discussions with newspapor people here ur with Govern-
ment people and that ho would report on ate a! a the
Case Officer,

8. Stevenson has bee: informed by WH/C that he ae
i is to tell Subject (if a meeting takes place) that .
7 Subject is to coatact his Case Officer in Washington.
Another meeting is scheduled with Subject before his i
Hl departure for Miar:., As the situation now stands it 7
| is unlikely that Subject will have any contacts with
Government officials with the possible exception of
Stevenson. The present Case Officer has impressed upon
Subject the lack of wisdom in his present benavior, the
danger of blowing himself and the consequences that
would follow. Subject appeared to have understood the
gravity of the situation and expressed willingness to
cooperate, at least for the present.
