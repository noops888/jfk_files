of Training, General Staff of the Cuban Rebel Aray, is anti-
Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the
word. He sticks to his military duties acd scrupulously
ayoids politic: he keeps himself completely isolated from

all political elements. He is proud of his present status

and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears ufwilling to undertake any kind of activity against

that he has few officers with the military discipaine,
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
