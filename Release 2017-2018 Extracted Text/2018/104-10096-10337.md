MEMORANDUM FOR: .. JEW aatene

Shep phoned to say that James Wileott, Ivey a finance
clerk with the Agency from 1957 (EOD .as GS-4), who served
in Tokyo 1960 to October 1968, has told HSCA people that
GIA hired Lee- Harvey Oswald when Oswald served in Atsugiy
Wilcott, after returning from Tokyo was assigned to JMMAVE
in 1965, and resignayretired ip 1966.

I noted that Oswald retired’ from the Marine Corps in
September 1959. and went to the USSR in Oftobed:that veer ,
returning totihe US in June 1962. He was gone from Japan
by the time Shep told me Wilcott got there. “Anything tht
Wileott thinks he knew had to be second hand.’ I said that
Russ Holmes inherited the so~called Oswald files, but that
he has assured me the Agency had no contact with Oswald, If
there are contrary records they would have to be in EA files

at WIC, and EA should be on it right away to identify what
is involved. When anything turns up to be checked, 0/Fin
should then get at if tight avayy He is after ity
