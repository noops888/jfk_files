MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with AMVHIP/1, New York City, 20 August 1964

1. Meeting Time/Place/Purpose. This meeting was held in
the offices of AWWHYD/I from 1200 until 1430 and from 1815 until
2000 on 20 August 1964. The purpose was to discuss MHAPRON
matters and to brief him for his coming trip to Europe and the
expected re-contacts with AMLASH/2 and UNSNAFU/19.

2. Details of Meeting.

8. “El Mago" ROBREXO. According to ROBRENO'’s futher
who is prosently Tiving In exile in New York City, El MAGO
is presently living in Madrid at Pension HISPANA, Ave.

Jose Antonio 44, Plaza del Callao; telephone No. not known,
A/1 will go Madrid to see EL MAGO on MHAPRON rqms, and then
take him to Paris for a few days, if he is willing. (EL
MAGO should be useful for gleaning information from the
Embassy types while in Paris.)

b. Jewelry Deal. According to AMWHIP/1, there have
not been any transactions since the initial ones of 300,000
and 10,500 in June 64. He had expected to receive a packet
of jewelry per month worth ca. 50,000 dollars. A/l also
wrote some time ago (June 64) to UNSNAFU/19, but has not re-
ceived an answer to date. It is not known at this time
whether the lack of further jewelry packets is just poor
adainistrative procedures on the part of the Cubans, or
whether perhaps A/l is suspect for some reason by the Cubans.
This should be resolved when next A/l meets with 0/19.

c. FAL Equipment. A/} stated that he felt one of the
first things 5D HAGO would ask him was about the FAL equip-
ment which AMLASH/1 has requested. A/l was told that the
Silencer for the FAL did not exist and that it probably was
not feasible to attempt to adapt a make-shift one, according
to wespon authorities. The matter of a telescopic sight was

not discussed. A/l was told that special equipment fo- a
Fifle such as the FAL was difficult to procure as the
weapon was designed primarily as a general-purpose combat
weapon, not for special tasks. A/l then asked about the
possibility of purchasiag a special scapoa ia Europe and
have EL MAGO take it back with him, He was told that such
special rifles (probably for bunting big game)were un-
doubtedly available in Europe, but that this did not solve
the biggest problem of how to get it into AMLASH/1. He
was told that such a gun or any part of it would undoubted
ly be highly suspect if EL MAGO tried to bring any such
items into Cuba. It is apparent, however, that this topic
will continue to be one of concern to all persons connected
with the AMLASH/1 operation until it is resolved. Perbaps
the ‘best bet would be to level with AHLASH/1 at the next
meeting and tell him that such equipmnt will net be forth-
coming from KUBARK or ODYO<E sources, together with the
reasons why not.

da. sau tion Cuban Pesos. A/1 stated that he had
called Ricardo jon in iphia several times
(confirzed by telecons earlier between undersigned and A/1
in New York) but that im each case, the son had stated that
he had received no packages from his father from lexico
during the latter's last time in that city. A/1 thought
this indeed strange. The undersigned opined that perhaps
it was difficult to obtain pesos today due to the stringent
currency controls now in force in Cuba. We suggested to
AMWHIP/1 that he not pursue this problem with BORDO further,
as any over-zealous efforts on his part to obtain the
currency might come to the attention of the Cuban authorities.
Of course, if BORDO does produce thé pesos at a later date
(with no additional prompting from A/l), they will be readily
accepted.

©. Eduardo PERNAS. A/}-Stated that he believed long- .
time Commie Vincentina Antina was the mistress for many
years of Eduardo PERNAS, a jeweler acquaintance of A/1's
who owned (until intervened several weeks ago by the Castro
government) part of the jewelry firm of Pernas Gomez y Cia
(Consulado) located on the corner of San Miguel and San
Rafael Ste, Havana. PERNAS also had a store in Mexico City.
According to A/1, PERNAS is now out of Cuba in Mexico, and
should have some interesting information to provide, since
he was ac close to ANTUNA for many years. PERNAS can be
reached at his store, Plaza de la Constitucion 7, Hexico
City, telephone No, 13-32766. (Eqs traces on one Eduardo
PERNAS, possibly identical with above PERNAS are attached.)

PERNAS is originally of Spanish national: . This lead
bas been passed to the MHAPRON shop for Yollow-up. A/1
stated that he believed PERNAS's business was protected
from interveption up to thi. time through the inter~
cession of earURA (AMMHIP commented that his business
along with those of most of his friends suffered their
fate quite some time ogo.)

2. Raymundo TORRES ("El Gua¥iro"). TORRES called
A/1 from Wexico y Ww: a mes From AMLASH/1 for
A/1 (see below), At that time, TORRES out from Cuba on
a trip, was staying at the Hotel Guardiola, Ave. Madero
and San Juan de Letran, phone 218580, Later he moved to
Hornes 74, Apt 304, Mexico, D.F. A/1 stated that TORRES
was all right and apparently was trusted enough by AMLASH/1
to deliver an inocuous message and letter, the latter being
not so haraless, A/l stated that TORRES wae g:ven to
# et drinking and took dope upon occasion. (No identifiable
ciate traces on TORRES).

€- AMLASH/1, LASH sent A/l the accompanying letter
mailed by TORRES. from Mexico. The text is self-explanatory.
It bas been decided that there would be too much room for
suspicion if KUBARK tried to bave LASH invited to the cited
National assembly of Surgeons. A/l has an acquaintance
+e with one Manuel RODRIGUEZ, who was in 1959 a eedical student :
and President of the Mexican F.E.U. He suggested that if !
he could locate RODRIGUEZ, he might be able to have hin
formally invite AMLASH to the Assembly, as the latter desires. :
A/) has not seen RODRIGUEZ (on whom there are no identi- :
fiable traces) for about three years, but believes tiat
—— there is no risk in attempting to locate hia and asking this 4
favor. It is perhaps worth the effort, although admittedly a
it is a long shot. It should be noted that RODRIGUEZ'S
father is believed to be a communist, but that, according
. to A/1, RODRIGUEZ is not. (This would adually not be a
problem, providing RODRIGUEZ believed that he wis just doing
& favor for A/1 who desires to see his old friend LASH.)
The note added to LASH's letter from "Marzo" is fron
Marcelino ARTIME Vega, who was used as a cut-out for mail
‘ between LASH and A/1l prior to the October 62 Crisis. MARZO
is a former phys. Ed instructor in the Batista eza , and ia
presently employed at Los Hermanos store selling Jewelry.
He ie trusted by LASH and A/I, ne@dless to say.

3. There were no incidents of a security nature which
_eame to the attention of the undersigned. A/1 will be contacted
telephonically concerning arrangements and advice on the AMLASH/1
letter. If necessary, @ personal meeting will be arranged prior
