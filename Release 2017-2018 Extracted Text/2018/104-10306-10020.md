MEMORANDUM FOR: General Carter, DDCI

Attached is a copy of a memorandum for my file outlining
policy decision in connection with the Cuban prisoner transaction.
In your absence this memorandum was discussed with Messrs.
Helms, Houston, Miskoveky and McManus, and upon receiving
final approval from higher authority at 1:45, Mr. Houston was
instructed by me to initiate appropriate actions.’

3t ie exceedingly important that great care be exercised
to minimize the publicity and to emphasize humanitarian interest
on the part of the United States Government in securing the release
of the prisoners. Both the President and the Attorney General are
anxious that the explanations giventhe Cuban Families Committee
be handled with great care. I agree with this and urge that extreme
caution be taken to avoid attribution or CIA implication in this matter.

14 November 1962

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
CONCERNING THE NEGOTIATION FOR THE RELEASE OF THE CUBAN
PRISONERS.

The meeting took place at the residence of the Attorney
General at 10:30 a.m., on Thursday, November 14, at the DCI's
request.

McGone explained that he had had dinner the evening before
with Mr. Edward Foley (former Under Secretary of the Treasury,
legal representative and a Director of the Drug Industry Association).

Mr. Foley had questioned DCI concerning the negotiations
for release of Cuban prisoners in exchange for some 50 million
dollars in druge, and stated that Mr. Donovan had been in touch with
members of the industry (presumably Pfizer and Merck) in the past
few days, that indications were that the transaction was to be worked
out promptly, and the subject would undoubtedly be discussed at
length at the Industry's Board of Trustees meeting in New York on
November 16th.

Mr. Foley stated that the Industry had mo clear understanding
of the Government's position, most particularly in view of Cuban
developments of the last three weeks.

After explaining to Foley the background of the transaction
I told him that Mr. Donovan had been told to do absolutely nothing
in thie matter and expressed great surprise that the subject was a
topic of current discussion ameng members of the Industry.

In the meeting with the Attorney General I expressed \ erave
concern over the situation, pointing out haa
dollars on covert deposit in the (Bani t
of: Credit on issued by the Baik, one in the amount.
dollars td and one for \evenimillion dollars
long as this money wae on deposit and ‘the letters outs:
was a danger of publicity emanating from ther Donovan or the drug
industry, or both. Despite the fact that’no official government



SECRET-LHES

connection had ever been admitted, publicity would implicate the
Administration and CIA in the negotiation because of recent press
stories (most particularly the Herald Tribune articles). identifying
Administration and CIA activities and citing the.exact amount of

\7 million| dollars as representing the Government cost of the drugs.

T pointed out that certain elements of competition between the members
of the drug industry made it almost a certainty that "leaks" would
come from industry sources as long ae the letter of credit were
outstanding, regardiess of Mr. Donovan's denials. -

Furthermore, consummation of the transaction seemed
totally unrealistic in view of current difficuities with Castro and if
en article appeared indicating we were still pursuing this transaction,
the American public and a great many others would be confused and
disenchanted,

For the above reasons, and feeling that damaging publicity
undoubtedly would appear, I strongly recommended that we arrange
for the bank to withdraw the. Letters of Credit, forthe withdrawal

: of-a-substantial part of the.money from the (Ban! Also

advise Mr. Donovan that the pursuit of this effort must await a better
climate although our interest remained constant. I urged that
action be commenced today.

The Attorney General, after some discussion involving an
exploration of pessible alternatives, agreed with the course of
action.

We agreed that we should carefully explain to the Families
Committee and possibly to Miro Cardona that we were inno way
abandoning our intention to secure the release of the prisoners but
were forced because of circumstances beyond our control to set the
negotiation aside pending further developments on other important
problems involving our Cuban relationship.

MeCone discussed the above with Mr. Bundy who personally
approved the action and, in turn, received approval from higher
authority. The latter was communicated te the DCI by telephone
at 145 p.m.

November 6, 1962

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Cline, DD (1)

SUBJECT: Castro as a Threat to the Americas.

I think that in analyzing Castro's potential in the Western
Hemisphere as covered by paragraphs 9 through and including 21,
we should consider his posture and potential under various alternatives
of possible United States decisions and probable Soviet policies.

Let us assume for the moment that the United States meets
the exact letter of the Kennedy-Khrushchev exchange and no more,
This would mean the withdrawal of IL 28s, the halting of the establish-
ment of a submarine base, and some acceptable form of inspection
verifying the removal and assuring against the reintroduction of
offensive devices, U.S. commits not to invade. At this point U.S.
commitment on propaganda, sabotage, guerrilla activities and other
actions designed to overthrow Castro is not very clear, but I think
that we can assume that such activities if attempted would be no
more successful in the future than they have been in the past, which is

about zero.



TOP SECRET

Having reached this point, the Soviets have at least three
alternatives:

One, they can abandon Castro, reduce military and economic
aid, cut their losses, and in such event Castro would soon collapse.
Current intelligence does not support such a probable Soviet course
of action, otherwise they would not be disposed to leave such quantities
of extremely valuable modern military hardware, including the SAM
sites, communications equipment, and extensive Naval and ground
equipment and a large number of technicians.

Second, they could maintain about the same level of economic
and military support as in the past, although I would feel this could not
be a very reasonable assumption from the standpoint of military support
as the presence of large amounts of additional military equipment, in-
cluding those mentioned above, would necessitate a higher level of
military support than before in order to provide operational readiness,
training, maintenance, spare parts, replacements, etc, This does not
mean more economic supporthlthough I think Castro could insist upon
it-on the grounds that Soviet equipment is a burden to him and of course

Dorticos alluded to this in statements in New York.



QP SECRET

Third, the Soviets having accomplished one of their objectives,
that of securing a U.S. guarantee against invasion, will increase their
oh military and economic aid so that all military materiel will be work-

able at all times and the Castro economy will be reasonably well off.
Under each of these alternatives, Castro's posture and his

effect on the United States and other Western Hemisphere countries

will differ vastly and I would suggest that your paper be oriented so
that it will project for the benefit of policy makers the consequences,
favorable or unfavorable, under these several alternatives,

It is my personal opinion that Mikoyan will return to New York

ay in a few days and will announce an agreement for some perfunctory

Red Cross ground inspection of the missile sites and nothing else,
will deny any intention of a submarine base, will dismiss the IL 28

issue as wholly. beyond the Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement, will

indicate that all Soviets are leaving Cuba except economic and
agricultural advisers, and will state most persuasively that the
Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement has been fulfilled to the letter and
demand our non-invasion commitment.

He will then build Castro up and indicate Soviet intention for

supporting in every way and to go right down the line with him,



Castro will feel secure, his political and military structure will be
manageable, and Cuba will be used by Castro and the Soviets more
aggressively in the future than it has in the past in disturbing
Western Hemisphere countries,

This is the situation 1 fear, and I think our policy makers
whose negotiations are trending toward the establisiment of a set
of conditions and commitments which will make the third case
mentioned above a probability, should have the benefit of our
thinking as to the consequences, In doing this, equal attention
should be given to the first two alternatives,

In further reference to the paper, the historical background
is excellent, the country by country annex useful, although if time
permitted we might get the chiefs of station to give the current view
of their contacts as Win Scott did, The inventory of equipment is
useful but I propose that it be broken down into three columns, a

pre-July lst, 1962, added since July 1962, and the total as of now.

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: CIA activities in Seeth Viet Nam

1. Prior to January 1962 the CIA maintained a modest station
im South Viet Nam, the purpose of which was te support the Ambassador
and Headquarters with reports on the internal situation in South Viet
Nam, the activities of the Viet Cong and the Communists and their

threat to the government, and to assist the governmennt in ite internal

escurity problema, Among other things we trained aad equipped
Special Forces whose mission was te conduct a variety of unconventional
activities euch as the infiltration of V.C, centere, interdiction of
supply voutes, interfering with V.C. communications, sabotaging

V.C, efforts, harrassment, etc.

The CIA station crested about a denen training centera
throughout South Viet Nam in which selected nearby villagers would
be trained in comnaumity defense and civic action. K issued arms and
thus provided the actual defense of the strategic hamlets created
in the arene. These activities were carried on with the support af
the U.S. Special Feeces. As the activities expended, s determination
wae made to ahift prime responsibility to the military, with CIA
im support, and the switch has been accomplished succesefully.
About 75,000 South Viet Namose have been trained,

GIA created a South Viet Namese intelligence organisation,
established a civilian intelligence system and trained the personnel.
in adflitioa the Agency aseisted in the development of intelligence
spparatus within the SVN military.

im addition a variety ef activities were supported designed to
assist the basic objective of winning the war.

Without exception ell CLA programs in South Viet Nam were
cosrdinated with the Ambassader and alee in Waghington, CIA tock
ne unilateral actions nor involved {tself in designing policy. CIA has
been represented at all policy meetings in Washington, including NSC
and Executive Committee meetings and all cf the McNamara-Pear!.
Harbor mpetings held to review progress. The activities of the
station were examined by all inspection teams ouch ac Gensral
Wheeler's mission, General Krulak's several missions,

Mg. Ferrestal’s missiona, etc. At no time pricr te recent surge
of eritieal publicity have CIA's activities in Saigon been reported
other than cooperative and en integral part of an accepted and agreed
policy.
2. CIA Reparting.

tn June 1962 I traveled extensively in South Viet Nam.
I reported upon my veturn that repressive meacures ef the Diem/Nhu
regime were causing considerable criticiem and that there was

-2-


danger of a coup. This situation was watched carefully by our CIA
station and at frequent intervals we reported that the image of the
tegime was tarnishing and hence its effectivensas was questionable.
A sumber of estimates and e great number of reports and appraisals
were issued, each one warning that the deterioration of the regime's
popularity gave tise to sericus question concerning the future trend
of the war and CIA warned that unless corrective measures ware
taken by the regime te impreve its image, it was quite pessible
the war would be lost or that 8 popular uprising would cause the
removal of the regime. For 18 months at frequent intervals rumors
of coups were received by our station and were reported to the
Ambassador and te Waghingten. Throughout thie period our Chief
of Station at the direction of the Ambassador met once every two
weeks with Ngo Dinh Nhu, explored all problems relating to the
eituationa in which we had a common interest, and reported to the
Ambassador, Contacts were also maintained with many groups in
South Viet Nam, with military leaders and with knowledgeable
citisens,

A review of the reporting over 18 monthe and resulting
estimates bear out that the Agency consistently warned of the

deteriorating situation and the pessible consequences.


13-00000

During this period we also analysed the progress of the
war and the thrust of our reporting was to the effect that as the
Arsorican advisers wore able to exercias their influsnce on the
Seuth Viet Namese military, and our Embassy and General Harkins
wore able to pereunde Diem to recrient and redeploy his forces,
gradual but consistent favorable progress was made.

3. Attitude af the Station and Others

in ony difficult sitestion involving guerrilla warfare where
progress can not be measured in territery won or lest, and in
casualties and prisoners, differences of opinion among observers
arise, Lihewise Americans required to work with a stubborn
and authoritarian regime eften become exasperated by the
difficulties inveived. Furthermore Americansaccustomed to our
civil liberties, freedems, and the rights of the individual are
shozked by tho conduct of a government which deprives the individual
of these privileges. Finally an American community living ameng
natives, many ef whem age visiously critical of the government (aad
thie {9 the cace in Saigon and Has), are bound to be influenced
by, and te a dagree espouse, these criticiems.

For these reasons there have been serious differences within
the American community.


13-00060

Within the CIA station there are differences of opinion.
Some feal the cause is hopeless with the Diem regime in power,
Others feel it best to go along with the regime until a better one
appears, The reporting has been, however, consistent and has
coincided with the views of Ambassador Noiting.

Within AID and USEA there have been strong differences
of opinion and the eame is true of the Embassy staff. On the
other hand, the military which is devoted to the single task of
defeating the Viet Cong, had turned its back on political problems
and concentrated on military probleme and have been stesdfast
in refusing to be deterred by internal political iasues,

Many people have become highly emotional, have talked
tee much and have given the impression of very deep splits.

4, Situation in the lnct several weeks.

The Hue incident on May 8th was a serious setback for the

Diem Government. The agreement with the Buddhists on June léth was

deaigned to impreve the situation. The agreement wae never carried
out, Incveasing agitation by the Buddhiste culminated in the raids on the
pagodas on Anuguet 2l. This wae earried out apparently at the direction
of Nhu by the Special Forces, seme ef whom are in -he Saigen - Hye
area and by the military, In this connection i¢ te to be noted that neither
MACV nor CLA maintained absolute contrel ever the deployment of the
Special Forces and it is to be noted that substantial units of them were
deployed to the north and eagaged in their regular assignments.

The action on August 21 broke the camel's back as far aa those
in the United States Government who felt that the cause would be lest if
the Diem regime remained, Therefore, a cable was cent to the Ambassador
instructing him to insist on effective reforms including reducing the influence
and authority of the Nhus and if thie could uot be accomplished by peseustiba
to take such action as would accomplish this ebjective even though it meant
removing the regime.

The fault in this instruction wae that there existed at the time no
flym estimate ae to the possibility of successfully reforming the regime
and no plan for a successor regime.

At this point CIA was asked by the Ambassador and General
Harkins to query certain military leaders and te determine whether the
-6-

enone
eee)


resentment had created a body ef opinion among the military, the Security
Forces and the public that would carry off a coup and establish a new
government, CIA reported this condition did not exist. During the week of
Auguat 26 and without taking a position as to whether the regime should or
should act be removed, the Agency urged care and deliberation. It pointed
out that to act precipitously and without eseurance of eyccuses a civil war
would inevitably result, the war against the Viet Cong would be lost and
the Communists would take over.

This poeition was highly exasperating te those who wished to
move precipitously. It is. for this reason that the advocates of action to

move precipitously without coordination and without intelligence support

: ate now carrying on a campaign against the Central Intelligence Agency

and the Station.

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Carter

You will note from the very brief memorandum of my.
discussion with Secretary Rusk that he made two requests --
the first, a study of the reasons for lack of action of the
Communists in Southeast Asia. This is a matter I discussed
at this morning's meeting and I hope that we can have an OCI
memorandum on my return,

The second question was concerning clandestine channels
to Castro, the Chinese Communists and Hanoi. This should be
given serious thought by DDP. Each situation differs. Iam sure
we could, if we desired, open up a channel to Castro, The
Peiping and Hanoi situations are more difficult. In one respect

there is a channel open ini ugh Warsaw, but it is not
effective, Perhaps th ould have some thoughts
on this. Also, there is a channel to Hanoi through the

representative on the ICC; however this obviously is an "official"
channel and is not very productive. I think it would be well to
go over this matter with Dick Helms when he returns.

Secretary Rusk expects comments on both these points
next week, c
