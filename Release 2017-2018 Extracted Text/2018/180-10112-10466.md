Notes - call from Frank Sturgis 6/25/76

He just ran across a friend of his who used to be an agent, in

communications,

and a he "revived" his mind

on something that

he "completely

had lost

forgot."

He had previously told me that he

almost all his notes from his adventures in the

intelligence business, which explains why he hadn't remembered

this before.

He reminded me he told me that he had been sent to washington

by a group of key men

in Castro's inner circle and told to

give some secret documents and lists of names to Hoover, personally.

(Sturgis didn't tell me this, but Pedro Diaz-Lanz -- the guy who

came out with Sturgis and was head of Castro's Air Force -- told

someone the list contained the

names of Cuban exile double agents.

At the top of the list, says Diaz-Lanz, was Artime's name. )

sturgis

says he never did get to see Hoover but he did see his

personal secretary.

He says he was sent to Hoover directly

because the insiders didn't trust the. American Embassy.

He believes the Rockefeller Commission and the Watergate Commission

has testimony from

his about plots

agamast Castro, but he couldn't

get

an OK to assassinate pa*s Castro because of the Eisenhower

administration.

One of the people that Sturgis says he was in touch with here,

besides *hadia tbe ClA, was

Tarabochia.

He was in touch

with

Tarabbohia at this particular time, and therefore Tarabochia

would know of this incident:

There was a meeting

in Cuba bout two, two and half months

before the Kennedy assassination.

There were a number.of

high-rakking rebel officers present:

Ee Fidel, Raul, Che,

¡the chief of G2 (can't remember his name), a man who

was called

"El Mexicano, "

several other people, a woman...and Jack Ruby.

The meeting was in Havana. One of the rebel officers present was

sa half-brother at of a Cuban exile living in Miami.

After the

JFK assassination, the officer sent a letter to his half brother

telling of the meeting, the discussion to assassinate JFK and

the presence of Jack Ruby. He smuggled the letter out, probably

ithhough Mexico.

The deal was that Castro would supply Ruby with a flow of drugs.

Ruby would

get the money to buy the

drugs by being given the

winning number in the bolito drawing.

That's how Ruby would

be

paid off..

When Cuban exile got letter some ClA agents found out about it, but

"before they

could get it from him,

in Miami

and he turned over the letter to agents from the Miami: FBI

office.

ro to control tre i re

made contact with the FBl here

They advised him that it was a very delicate situation and

not tell anyone about it.

Sturgis doesn't know name of Cuban exile, but he worked.

in a factory

in. Miami or Hialeah. He's going to try to find out, he's checking

on it now.

The friend he ran into, the guy with the company, was the one who

told him Tarabochia had this information.

the background is this:

Ruby had gone to Cuba many

times and

while he was there he was

trying to get some action

"McWillie was

friend of his, as you know."

(NOTE: In

interview with Canfield in Coup d'fat

sturgis has a tough time

remembering who McWillie is page 243). This is where Ruby

probably thought a up the idea of making a deal with Castro.

"We all know he had criminal connections."

There should be

some record of his trip through the American Embassy in

Mexico City of his trip to cuba through there. "But this could

have been a secret ten trip he went on,

on the other hand, if

he was involved an in an

assassination."

He doesn't know how long after the assassination the Cuban exile

got the letter from his

half-brother. (l/. probably.came

Sturgis: "This

man here like to had

a shit hemorrhage."

(Coincidence?: From Robert Morrow's Betrayal: "Not to be vulgar,"

I thought aloud,

"but he'll have a shit hemorrhage." Morrow

speaking of Castro's reaction to his counterféét operation. d

(1 asked him about Crile's piece in the Wash. Post re the Castro-

Trafficante

relationship)

sturgis says that's news to him. But he doesn't believe it

because Castro kicked out the mob and Lansky and Trafficante

lost their casinos.

told Santos one

day, I said, 'Santos,

I: just ***xa left a meeting with Castro and he ordered me to

close down the casinos for 10 days.".

And he did. Sturgis was

put in charge of casinos for a while by fastro.

Sturgis believes if that was the case, that would make Aleman an

agent for Castro also. But if he did make contact with Trafficante

it was through Rolando Martinez, because he knew Trafficante

very well, he used to work for the Havana Hilton, so he knows

all. ** the mob people, "He knows them as well as l do."

Aleman and Martinez are xaXxa*ia

very close friends.

Barker got fired from the ClA because of his connections with the

racket people.

Sturgis - 6/30/76 = tatel

--says: Tarabochia should

remember Castro-Ruby incident because

"I know thellA agent, or former agent, who told him about it.".

-thinks the

woman he mentioned

as being at the meeting was Tanya,

Che's secretary who was

killed witth him

Bolivia..

-also trying to get

name of Cuban exile in Miami who received

the letter

=-his ex-ClA friend

spoke to. Tarabochia. about it at the time and

perhaps

Tarabochia wa should have it on

record.

...it

should alsok be part.of the FBl files

in Washington, along

with the original

letter...

-ClA should have a report in too,

"We sent the report in."

***

--re Cellula Fantasma: (Was that Company operation or Naval

Intelligence operation?,

"No, Company operation." The people

who were involved, in that were Dr. Louis Conte-Aguerra (sp?);

he asked

my assistance and l went to see my CO, who was

Sam Jenis.

Conte-Aguerra was associated with the Company and

they came to me because

they knew

I was about the a only one

who could do successful air operations.

So they asked me

if I would do a series of five

air operations and I said, certainly,

I would...

cre l heard of the relationship ax of Jukio Lobo and his

anti-Castro

activity.

I understand Bill Attwood went down

to interview him and...

"Well, Bill was with the Company.

No, wait a minute, wait

a minute..

Attwood, Attwood...

forget... l think he was

the company... I'm not sure offhand...l didn't know all the agents."

(Wasnit it Rojas in charge of Cellula Fantasma?)

Conte-Aquerra

was the big man on it.

He's the one who arranged for the

financing for the people that I would do the operation for.

As a matter of fact, I went on three of them myself..l couldn't

get the Cubans to do it sol used Americans. One of the pidots

•was Bill Johnson..)

(What was Rojas' role?)

I didn't fool around with. Rojas.

You know,

there was

a movement within ClA which told Conte-Aquerra

that he

was going to be a big official in the new government..

And many of

the agents who were

also

going

to get positions went

along with

the

idea that Conte Aquerra would be the president of the new Cuba.

And

he was

being

financed through

his own ClA contacts to do a

series of these operations

(How does Lobo fit in?)

Well, Julio gave money.

He was working

also with ClA.

money which he was taking off income

tax and so forth.

This was the way what you'd call 'washigg" money.

This is how ClA would wash money through different Cuban business

people--and American businessmen--which wouldn't lead directly

to the ClA. Julio Lobo was one of the people.

(Were you dealing

with him much?) Well, I worked

with him, but

I wasn't dealing directly with

him because he wasn't connected

with a the s

people 1

was

associated with.

He was

more with

the economic section, you

know, that certain officials dealt with.

(You met him here in Miami or Havana?) In Havana.

But I didn't

have any

& dealings with him because, you know, certain people

worked with certain people. It was the thing

that you call

compartmentation, you know.

They dealt with didferent people in different ways.. Just like

Tony Verona.

He was a ClA agent. He not only was one of the

leaders, he was an agent per se.

And even today Manolo Artime

is still an agent.

He wasn't then but he is today.

He's still

with them.: You know he was the civil coordinator between the

Revolutionary Junta and the Bay of Pigs..:

(mentioned Gerald Shamma and her Artime story) Heh heh bah, she

told you that story, eh. I wish she hadn't told you that

sodry,

heh heh heh.

Artime: "When he came back from Cuba, they made him a businessman,

they

made

him a very wealthy man.

I think he's got a little

problem with Semoza

now,

but he was working closely with him.

**But if you're with

the right people they don't give

a shit

what you did, as long as they control you.

The ClA got some

shits of the world working for them.

The Agency slammed the door on all four of us when we got

out of prison. Colby sent orders out to all stations not

to talk to us or have any contact with us.

But it makes no

**difference to me, if I need to get to them I go through other

people..

But,

hey, that's the

name of the game, I guess.

When you get

into the

big league stuff with the powefaul people up in Washington

or Langley, if the wrong group of people are in control and you're

not in

that league, they can hurt you. And right now the wrong

group is up there.

Have been since Colby's been up there.

Colby's

got his own

people and l'm not one of them."

(Looks like they're getting ready

to hang & Lucien Conein, Well,

you know,

Howard knew him very well.

Evidentally,

he's been

involved

in some things and they don't want to let it come out.

But there's a lot of shit Colby has been involved in and he comes

out smedling like

a rose" Evidentally, he [Conein] is in band bad

with the wrong

people. Colby cleaned

house and

put his own people

in theeean and

what they do is use people for sacrificial lambs...

like they did us in Watergate... to take

the heat off of them..

Howard himself didn't realize that he was used and we in turn

worked with Howard and they buried

all of us..

But like I told you before, Bennett

was the man who really did

a number on the President.

(Bennett of Mullens Co.) And though

they

closed house and withdrew

all the agent that were overseas

working

for the & Mullens Co,

they re-opened

a new company

and had to re-do

the

agents with the new company...

l curious to

find out

where Bennett is right now.

(Howard Hughes connection) Oh yeah, they used him.. They let

him make a lot of money:

There's still a lot of places down

here especially that are still ClA fronts...

-remembered also that Castro's G2 at meeting name wasR

Romero Valez...

-notes--call from Frank Sturgis 7/28/76 -tatel

-said he wasn' surprised by the Schweiker announcement of

running with

"I think schweiker's using this thing,

but, hey, you can't blame him, he's a politician. The thing

worked out beautifully

he asked: "Is he still

officially investigating the JFK thing?"

I said, yes, he was

still interested. After a few minutes of inconsequential

conversation,

he

asked again: "Hey, let me ask you something.

Are you still

checking up

on the JFK thing?"

I said, yes, l

was.

Then

he said: "I told you about that letter from Cuba,

didn't 1?"

I said we

as had checked up on it and that we had gotten a

Tarabochia about it but the memo said nothing

although it did mention a trip to Cuba by Ruby.

He asked did the report mention about the letter that came

to the relative in Miami, he said his friend

"Salvatore" Ithe

former ClA man] told him definitely there was a ** letter

and that "Bob Dwyer probably was the man [the FBI agent], because:

he was in charge of the Cuban desk at the Bureau downtown, was

probably one of the agents who picked up the letter."

I told him that Tarabochia's memo indicated only that Ruby

went to Cuba, not that he had seen

Castro, and that the FBl

man was

James D'Oonnor, not Dwyer. Sturgis asked how we got

a copy of that memo and I told him I didn't know.

He implied

that perhaps it was changed or censured and I said that was

possible.

for all l knew, because

I had never seen the original.

He then

said that Ruby could have been to Cuba without people

knowing it, of course.

Sturgis then asked me if I o had ever heard of lyle Stuart.

said yes. he's the ax book ax publisher who has published

a lot of sensational and controversial books. "You know he

supposedly met Oswald a month before Kennedy was assassinated

in Miami, accordäng

to a report

There's supposed to be something in the newspapers in 1963 before

Kennedy was killed about Oswald being in Miami, Sturgis said, and

he is going

to the library to check up on that.

Lyle stuartit was also

says sturgis, was head of the Fair Play for Cuba

committee.

reported

he was very pro-Castro and

that Castro was supporting him financially

and that Lyle

Stuart was seen

with and connected with Oswald. And it was

reported in the papers that Oswald

was here a month before

the

assassiaation.

NOw

it may all

be bullshit but l'm still

going to

check

it

out."

sturgis said

the

man

who told him this was a writer who was "pretty

much

involved" in the investigation of the assassination.

He was

last night, and the guy said that lyle Stuart would be the

one to check

with.

The guy's name is Bob Traflins.

"I did ask him& if it would be alright for him to talk with you."

At this time sturgis went to get Trainins phone number and in the

background I could hear the television news which - coincidentally.-

happened

just then to announce the news of Howard Hunt filing the

$2-1/2 million libel suit against Weberman & Canfield.

"Did. you

hear that?" Sturgis asked, just to make sure.

"What Ellis is doing," said sturgis, "is to file Howard's now

and then by the we end of the week

or next week he's filing

mine.

Both Howard and myself

are

using Ellis. " [Ellis Rubin,

local controversial attorney

is most

known in Miami for his

publicity ploys and long-standing

feud with. State Attorney (Dade. co.)

Richard Gerstein. Sturgis

said the suit dad would be against

the authors and publisher of Coup D'Etat and against Playboy.

and Hefner and later maybe against Dick Gregory ("As soon as

I dig up enough about

him. ":

I said libel suits are tough to

win.

"Yeah, but hey," said Sturgis ISt. George was right: he

says

"but

hey" a loth, even if

we get a judgment for a dollar

it'll stop

all the shit about us

being involved in the the

assassination

of John F. Kennedy."

He asked if I had a chance to.

that

letter.

speak with the Cuban who received

I said no, l haven't had a chance because as a result

of his television appearances Wally. Weston had come forth with

his information and I had been busy on that.

"I spoke to

Wally Weston tonight," said Sturgis, "and I have a meeting to

sit down and find out what he can tell me and so forth."

Back on Oswald's meeting with Lyle Stuart, Sturgis said he

thinks it may have been

possible because there

was a report that

he himself had met Oswald in Miami and that could have been very

possible, what with all the anti-castro people he met and the

double-agents, but he himself didn't

remember it.

But he did

hear

that Stuart was connected with the Fair Play for Cuba

Committee and getting financial assistance from Cuba. "This

Bob Tralins was a

friend of his

and dislikes the man

very much,

but: he definitely told me this."

Switching subjects, I asked him

what he knew about operations

that took place from Cay Sal island.

[the Hughes connection.]

Afl he knew, he said,

that there was

a black Customs official who

tried to keep people off the island because the ClA used it as

a stepping stone,

like

a "listening

post": off the coast of Cuba.

He himself didn't have any operations from there. "On some .of..

the island close by there we stopped by occasionally for several

houss, but I kept away from Cay Sal

by other people, other aroups."

because it was being operated

"They were ClA operations.

C???] Was it Clavor other opegators?

One time Barker got a hold of me because

was doing

something, in some operations with Bill Johnson which

was financing, and Barker got

a hold of me and said, 'Hey, we're

doing something

very

sensitive

that area' and he asked me to

stop

for a while and

go into another area." [Note: This is obviously

conflicting: Who was Sturgis working for if not ClA? Here he became

very deliberately convoluting and

wound up talking about pinar de Rio

operations in Cuba. J

I asked him if he was involved in the training camp in New Orleans

with Gus

DeLabarre and Rudodph Davis: "No," he said

at all. I never knew about any

quickly.

"Not

l asked him

about the guy who was reportedly the head ClA

man

here, Mr. B, or Bender or his supposedly "real" name,

Drescher, and

what he looked like.

"Oh, I don't know," he

said.

mean

I never met him. You've got to understand the

agents

didn't talk to the contract employees, but there would

just be a telephone system of reporting.

The telephones were

connected by relays

so that if the FBl were checking the number

it would be

located

in

one area but it would just be a relay

station, so they could

never check it down."

Sturgis

talked then about Schweiker

and the Reagon situation and

I said

I thought they would have a

tough fight on their hands

against Ford who, after all, has all the power. "1 disagree

with you, " said sturgis.

"1

think the power is up there and

they're advising him

what to do.

He's being controlled, like

all Presidents are. Certain power groups control, you know

what I mean?"

He changed the subject and mentioned he had been out in California

last week. He said

he was invited out by Chuck Ashman La former

Miamian who has a radio or TV talk show out there and has

wiitten some exploitation books about the Mafia and the cla].

Sturgis said he has Oscar Fraley

i Cauthor of "The Untouchables")

who wants to do the

story of his life. EFraley's latest book

is on Jimmy Hoffal.

He said he has been trying to get a hold of his ex-agent friend

(Salvatore) who told him about

the Ruby in Havana story to get

more information

but the quy is in the Domican Republic for

the week.

Sturgis then asked if it were possible to get a copy of the

Tarabochia memo and I said l would

check on that

with my office.

The conversation got back on the ClA:

"The ClA is very funny," he

said.

"They

do things right up to a point and then they turn right

around and screw you.

Depending what their policy is; lf they

want to change it they'll change it and bury your ass

700.:"In

the last few years they've had their own internal, power struggle

and in that struggle a lot of people sa get hurt who are decent

people. Like if I favor Howard Hunt and his boss gets whacked out.

then everybody down the line goes. That could go into hundreds or

couple thousand people.

Just like when Helms left. I told you

that Nixon wanted

some

files

from

Helms and Helms

wouldn't give

it to him; so the president fired

him.

Now

I'm assuming..from

my discussions with certain ClA officials fired now. the files

he wanted

pertained to the Bay of Pigs and also the JFK assassination.

And Helms didn't to turn them over.

He was scared that if he

turned it over to the President, that Maldeman

and Erlichman

would have used it for political

reasons. And

after Helms was

fired McCord turned

aax around

and said, 'If Helms goes, all the

trees in the forest will fall!' That's why McCord blew

the

NW 50955

## Page 10

whistle on the President. Well, you know who Deep Throat was,

don't you?

I think Helms ordered Bennett to bury Nixon.

Deep Throat was probably several guys, but the main man was

Bennett, the ClA man.

Unfortunately poor Howard got sucked

into this thing, I don't think he even knew anything about it.

And Bennett was his boss, both at the Mullen company and

I suspect, his ClA chief also. Oh yeah, I believe certain

ClA officials,

Helms the major one, set up Nixon to be caught.

And the company's hot at me because I told all this to the

Rockefeller and the Senate Watergate committees. But fuck'em,

they screwed me enough

all these years.

Maybe Schweiker will

get to be the Vice President and j'11

get him to get

me

into ClA and 1'1l clean

that place up myself..."

And on that note....

Says

he's

at a friend's house

and this friend just came back

from

Israel.

He was in one of the big notorious prisons over

there, Pomley (sp?) prison outside Tel Aviv, the top security

prison where

all the major captured terrorists are locked up..

... his friend is very much in with the American dews in this

area and he had gone to Israel with the idea of trying to

help Israel

as an undercover agent, to help infiltrate the

He did that and came back with a lot of information.

sturgis told him. he would

try to get someone to talk with

him because he feels there is much

information his friend

has that our government should be avare of, since he made

friends and has

lot of connections

now with the terrorist

leaders in prison.

He put himself in prison with. the knowledge

of Israeli Intellengence.

"This guy has worked for me in the past and he's worked as

an undercover agent for several federal agencies.

He used to

be with the French

Foreign Legion, the guy is really a hot-shot

guy. "

--Name is Edwin Keiser .

sturgis said he thought I might find

this guy's story of interest. "Whether it can be of

any help

to you or schweiker, I don't know. After all, your boy is

running for politics

now. "

I said I didn't know whether Schweiker would be interested in

that information since it's really outside our subject area.

"You never can tell," said Sturgis, "you know how politicians

are.

If they think there's a little bit of something that they

might be able. to use and Schweiker, I don't know what a kind of

religious background he's got but that sounds. Jewish anyway."

I said

wasn't interested in the political

aspects of any kind

of intelligence

information and /didn't think schwiker.was either.

"Well, why don't you just say hello to my friend here anyway,

1:

said Sturgis. "He's got an interesting backgoound, l've known him

for a number of years and he's good to know.

"Hell, Frank," I said, "isn't there anybody you don't know?"

iSturgis laughed and

said,

"Well, there were some people I swear l

didn't know and l'd

like

to keep it that way. Ha, ha, ha, you know,

one of those things."

Ed Keiser got on the phone and said that his problem was that the

American Embassy in Israel, specifically the vice consul (whose

name is John Adams and who

is, in fact, chief of the ClA station),

told him

That when he:

Keiser, returned to the l.s. he would be

in touch with certain

people and now he

found that no one wants

to talk with him, because

technically he's under arrest for having

left this country with

a xasxe falsified

passport.

He says he had lost his

citizenship back in the mid-50's, without

his knowledge of losing it, when ate he joined the kraa French

Foreign Legion. He says it

was taken away without a hearing or trial

and he has since found out that shouldn't have been done.:

. He says,

however, he has

never stopped fighting Communism and he has been

out of the country several times

since then on false passports.

This last time he went to Israel he went on a forged passport and

after a month and a half he gave himself up and agreed to work

undercover in the prison for

the Israeli government.

He was

in Romley prison for five and a half months, including with

the 43 people they wanted to exchange on the hijacking

program

in Uganda, all the top-ranking terrorists.

He ked left in

good standing with these terrorists, including the six jews

and 30 Arabs who had plotted to take over the Israeli government

who had come in out of Syria.

He dame back to the U.s. to be prosecuted, paroled to this

country by the Israeli government an an Ra Israeli.

'I brought back quite a bit of information with me," he said.

For instance, he said, he was in prison with an American. whose

father is

very

big

man in the California movie business.

The

son was arrested for smuggling a half a ton of hashish, and

his family is dealing heavily here in the States and in south

America with cocaine and other drugs...

The Federal agents he's xxx

tried to talk with said they

can't talk with him because he's

under arrest aar

(for

false

use of a passport and his case

is not resolved.

"It's really stupid," he says. "I'm carrying

information around

with me, I supposed to be in

contact with intelligence over there

and

carry on with what l was doing, and I can't even talk with

people in my own coumtry to see if

they want me to continee.:

He was arrested by FBI here

after he arrived at kennedy airport

after being deported by

Israel.

They

put a $25,000 bond on x him

in New York and another $25,000 bond in Miami.

They a brought him

here for prosecution

because

here's where he

falsified the passport.

subpoenaed to Watergate when

Frank was

involved

was taken but nothing was done.

•"It was

really a sad

thing,' he said. " think it was just

used politically.. I had agents

in Cuba that were coming out of Havana who were willing to come here

and testify, but the Senate wouldn't send a PBY or couldn't get

authorization to pick them up.

This

all went to Howard Baker and

his

assistant Liebenaood and

they didn't do anything.

I have but

one life to

live and

I'll give it to my country, but l felt sour

about that..

He said he was

working

with the Cubars here in Miami

for a while

after Watergate but he

decided to go

to Israel and fight Communish

there "because those people are serious."

He says he effectively infiltrated the terrorist and communist groups

within Israel prisons and he brought

out important information

but

now

"it seems like my own country could care less about it."

He says he'd like to get the information primarily to: the ClA, especially

stuff about the & PLO. He says he has

pages of information which,

"if

he dropped on the United Nations

"would blow the lid off.": He wouldn't

do that, of course, without

the authorization of his government; "But

I'm sitting

on a g

keg of dynamite

here and I don't know why my

government is not. at

least talking with me... If they want to put me

jal!, put me jail, but at least first talk to me."

He says his wife put up their house to raise money for his bond.

He says. he's being represented by a public defender because

he

cant afford an attorney: Edward G. Galante (305-350-4391)

He says he talked

to people from DEA who say they're interested

in what I got and to head of intelligence of U.s. Customs

(Steve Czukos) here in South Florida == but they all put him

off and he hasn't heard

from any of them.

--meanwhile,

he says he is supposed to get back in touch aäk with

Israeli intelligence, he has a code and it was should have

been started a week ago, but he doesn't want to start it up

again without making our government aware of what he is going.

He says he also has

agents with the PLO who are waiting now

in Rome for him and he has been putting that off too.

He says his attorney is talking about making a deal with the

government but he's not interested, he's interested only in

getting out the information he has...

"I think that the information l have has something to do with

the security of this nation,

because it has something to do

with the security of Israel."

He says just the information

he has on

drugs alone is valuable.

The guy he met in prison who was busted with a half tone of

hash should be

out in two or three weeks and he's on be his

way back to California with a conspiracy he put together in

the Israeli prison..

Keiser says he's got knowledge of how

drugs are coming in, who's arranging for them, and who is

carrying them.

He says the DEA told him they are interested but because he is

still on charges and has a court case

pending, it is not. allowed

to talk with him or work. dak with him..

SHis home number is 832-3358.

He said: "If you can't get a hold of

ame, you can always get a hold of Frank and he'll know where l am

because l don't do

anything without his knowledge anyway."

I told Keiser I don't know what, if

anything, I could do about

his problem

but that I would bring it to the

attention of my office.

Sturgis than got on the line again and said that what keiser forgot

to

mention to me is

that he has

information that PLO leaders are

using the drug traffic to finance their terrorist operations.

--asked if | contaeted the person who got the note from

Cuba re

meeting of Castro

and

Ruby... asked if l would give him the ar

names and details again of the Tarabochia memo...

- doesn't know the name of Pratkin or Paskin mentioned in memo..

(Why would Ruby visit him?) well, why would

Ruby go visit

McWillie.. You know

Mcwillie was one of the big boys there...

so evidentally he had more than one connection... but remember

when he went over there there were no more racket guys there,

so why would he go see this man?

--Trafficante came out, I think, in 60, when they closed the

casinos... that was after l came

out...l left in

June of *2882*959-

1959

-- the casinos were still operating..

(Could Trafficante have had a deal with Castro?) I doubt it.

Remember I closed the casinos for 10 days on Castro's orders.

There was a big uproaa.

I told Trafficante and some of these

otherpeople, because l

was in charge of the casinos for

the government, and I told them,

I says, I want to tell you

something

for

your own good, Fidel has said that hasx he's going

to run all the gangsters out

of Cuba and take all their businesses.

On one

of my tours of the casinos I ran into Santos and l told

santos, l said, I want to tell you something, if you see your

other friends

tell them I was in the prime ministers office with

Fidel and Bidel said he's gonna

nationalize all the American

businesses here and he 's goinna run you fuckin' gangsters out

of Cuba.'

And he says,

'Naah, he can't do that, we got over

a hundred million dollars in

investiments here! Who the fuck

does he think he is?! He was really hot. "That sunavatich

should be dead!'

Naah, he was

an

enemy of Fidel's.

(what's behind Crile piece then?) I don't know. Crile took some

cracks at me.

Well, I can't say that's wrong, because l don't

know, all I can say

is what happened to me and what l know.

But, let's face it, Martinez worked for the mob. He was working

for

the Havana Hilton when I met him in 1959 on the baccarat table.

-- knows Aleman, not well. "not buddy

buddy with him like arenar,

never talked to him about this; "I'm

surprised Aleman came up with

that because one time Aleman borrowed some money from Santos when

he needed it."

Trafficante kill JFK?

"I don't think

50, no, I don't think so. The

man most logically to want to kill JFK would

be that guy k in New

Orleans, whassisname,

yeah Marcella.

He would be the logical one."

Surprised Aleman

said that.

"He's got

a lotta balls to say that

in the paper; argestatkex but why didn't it come out down here?"

**

But I don't know why Martinez k is working with Barker. Barker is

a totten sunavabitch.

But one of these days l'll find

out why a

certain ClA

agent wanted me to do a domestic assassimation. I wish

I bad a

good memory to &x find out when it was asked me because that

would nail that sunnavabitch CO of the party, because as I understand

his CO was very leftist and considered

an undercover Communist agent,

but l'll dig it out one of these days..

You know, Ambassador smith called

who was

chief of ClA in Havana

in 1959, a "goddamn Communist."

Oh,

you don't know what

went on...

(Was there a Cogswell also?)

I don't know, l'll have to check

some

of my notes on

some of these things.

You know Paul Bethel

was there also, he was the press agent... that was a nice little

cover...yeah,

he was an

agent... he may be retired right now,

but l believe he's done

some contract work for them off and on...

No, I can't believe that Santos worked with 8d Fidel; You know

I told you that they contacted me once, wanted me to kill fidel..

(Yeah, Norm Rothman asked you,

didn't he?)

Опаха по, по, по.

It was Hymie Levine and another party... but they had

a lot of

connections with other people, besides me, who were constantly

with Fidel and if they wanted

to nail him

they could have..:

Trafficante hangs out at Capra's (80th & Biscayne) when he's

in town... that's one of his people there.... 8 o'clock.

I haven't been there for years, but l know

, I was told one

time, if you ever

want to see me or something like that.

g'oclock,

have spaghetti with

me, you know, we'll both hit,

but I don't go there,

light.

course, you know me and Barker a. are on the outs.

I don't like Barker... You know,

I was gonna put Barker's

head through the wall kap in prison.

The sunavabitch

is

freakin!

coward.

I tried to get at him and four of the

prisoners grabbed me and he went into the corner like

goddamn baby, the sunavabitch.

But l'11 fix his ass.

You know I told the Senate Watergate Committee that

one

CIA

associate of mine asked me to do a domestic assassination,

and I told *e them it was Bernard Barker.

Add I told them,

if you don't believe me,

give me a polygraph...And his

CO was a goddamn Communist bastard! (yells)

Because he

sure loved Fidel, even over here.

But I told Barker I wanted

the orders directly from the because l wanted to make

sure l knew who the & people was...

I told Barker, if you're

co told you to contact me, then

I want to see him...then

the co told him he didn't

o want me to

do it...

And I don't

know what year

this

was...

•The Rockefeller Commission really

went into detail with me on that.

told them, I says, well,

• 111 be honest with you, because

this is why l'm so mad at

these goddamn ClA officials.

They get you to do their dirty

work and after a while they throw you to the wolves, like

they did at the Watergate and...uhh, you know... uhhh.. so now

I'm down

on them. Fuck em.

well, whatayagonna do?

lasked him who Barker's CO was:

talked

around it) Barker had

same CO here as he had in Havana

I forget who is CO was.,

because an employee had various

types of agents: Barker and

Martinez were contract agents,. I was not a contract agent, because

-2X 34X

I didn't sign a contract and

didn't swear to arreax secrecy,

but I was a so-called field operator recruited by them to

work for them on a cash basis, for a week or for months...but

I wasn't in the same position

Barker and Martinez was...because

there were times here when they wanted me to turn in Cubans

making raids against Cuba and I said, Hell, you gotta be kiddin'

I'm

a goddamn

revolutionary! Just because you people are not

assisting Cubans anymore,

l'm gonna

turn them in? Fuck you, l'm

not gonna

like l was very close to Sam Jenis and

whole x family, we were very close, very close, since 1956,

and I worked with that whole family, and two of the family

members

were ClA people, but they knew

how I felt, they knew I would

never betray the cubans..

... this here David Phillips, he knocked the shit out of me on

televisoon, he said, "We

never did no

assassination, and Sturgis

is full of

shit, he never had no association with. us, he never

was an agent!"

Well, fuck him; the sunavabitch, a week later

all the shit

broke loose about assassinations and all, and the

Gianncanna bit, and then admitted

on

television that when he was

chief of

western hemisphere division, that he notified the Cuban

government--Castro!

--through the Czechoslovakian embassy, when

Cuban groups were leaving the

south Florida area to da.go to

CubaR and a do operations against him.

Here's a man admitting

that he was betraying Cubans to.

********

(1 heard & he was involved in some Castro assassination attempts

that never came off)

"I'm gonna tell you something.. I think it's a little game they

play.

I think the plots that they

wanted us to do were simply

done

to go ahead and make certain people think that they were

working.

But I think what they were doing all along, they were

really betraying us, you know

what I mean?

They have one

policy: Nail 'em,

but behind the

door stop it. The Cubans

had.a d force here and they had this feeling against Castro;

SO

to pacify certain people who had

lot of influence here, they

had to pacify

them by saying, well, we're gonna do things, but

at the same time they're doing the

betrayal bullshit...

And

David Phillips convinced me

that they had been doing

this all

along, just betraying everyone, the American public and everyone..

(I hear he was pretty much involved in the Chilean thing also)

Who, Phillips?

With the Allende thing? You better believe it!

l1 asked him why did David Phillips have an interest in his

Cellula Fantasma operation, as l had heard he had?)

I don't

know, he said,

I really don't know. Well, he was pretty high

up, you know.. leven in 61, 62?)

••well, yeah..."

Said the

guy in charge

was conte-Aquerra, he worked for

the company, later

they sent him

to Europe on an economic mission...

"Then Diaz-Lanz

go!

into

the picture, he was suppose

to take over the group,

and that's what started a

lot of problems.

We had a lot of

problems and

think this is where David Phillips came in, becaase

;then

he started to get interested, you

know, because of Pedro

Diaz Lanz

coming into the group."

"I'm writing

a book.

I sign a contract with Oscar Fraley this

Sunday."

Doing a movie with Morgan on the Trujillo thing, and

Fraley will do the book of his life, less the trujillo thing..

-talk to Pedro Diaz Lanz, that's how

1got involved in the Trujillo

thing.

for the people.

Geraldine Shamma will tell you that also. she hates him..

(Do, you see him much?) Not too much. When we were in prison, yean.

Talk to Pedro diaz labo"fell you artimes andedle.

And talk to him about Artime. You Artime is still working

Artime's an double agent.

But since l've been out l've kept away from him.

don't want a

goddamn thing to do with the company...

-- (About about Roselli?) I think they nailed him good. How do l

read it? Cuban agents.

But | leave

a question mark.

I hate to

jump on something

else, really, but they're capable of doina

anything.

"Cause I did

a lot of dirty work for the sunavabitches,

believe

me,

and they'll get people like me - because you know l

was considered one of the most six dangerous men in thexartax

country - and

they can get people like me to do a lot of their

dirty work, you know what

I mean, because it leaves their hands

clean and if they want to discredit you they can because they have

the force and the power, they got everything working for them...

But l'll give them the benefft of the doubt, I don't think they

had anything to do with killing the President through. That l'll give

them the benefit of the doubt...

about the letter, they told me that

they told they didn't know

anythingabout a letter...

*** O'Connor now

Hey did you read anything about four constables fron

... they turned it over to the FBl. and they gave a number

and now they can't find the documents.

Canyoubelieve that?

Just like

they can't find the letter, they can't find the

documents...

..You never got a whold of Salvadore, did you?

(You never gave

me his name)

Yes,

I did, I gave you his

phone number but

he told me

he wouldn't talk toyou, Schweiker!s

man..

Salvadore Garcia - former ClA guy... says he doesn't like

Schwelker.

The 8 FBI guys also asked me

I didn't believe l knew Roselli.

about it... They asked me

Rome about old them

about Roselli. I told them

I told them l know nothing

what I thought, I said I fought the

mob got rid of him..they're always fightingamong: temselves..

(re Crile pieces) l don't believe it.

I don't think Trafficante

had anything to do with it.

l don't

believe a guy like Trafficante

could

go ahead and do something like

that on his own,

he would

have to get permission

from the Commission, and I don't believe

the commission would

allow him to do something

like that. They

tried it once before with Anastasia.

Anastasia wanted.totake

over some of the gambling in Havana and the Commission said no.

What happened, he went against the Commission's orders And

Look what

happened to him.: The same thing happened to Dutch

schultz who wanted to knock off Tom Dewey.

You

I told you how in cuba the emiessy

how smith

And here you have

the mob

over there, all

these Cubans who were working for the mob

over there,

they came over here and the ClA made agents out

of them!

So, hey, the mob knew everything was going on..

You know, you

had

Normie Rothman who had the Biltmore Terrace,

which was Batista's money, the top floor over there was

going to house Batista if

the government gave me him permission

to come into thecountry.. Now that place was the hang out

of a lot of mob people.. a lot.. and a lot of cuban ClA boys

used to work for Batista.

the

That's bullshit.

That's where I met Martinez when

I was

working for the Embassy.

I told that to the Senate Watergate

Committee when they

asked me...(why) Well, because Martinez has

been working on $100 month retainer for the ClA and he has probably

dug up a lot of information for the company and writing thebook

with Crile and talking about Trafficante and Aleman, so naturally

the ClA don't want anybody to know there was any connection. de's

not goxax going to admit he worked for the bauxa gamblers..

(partial)

(get any reaction from the New Times piece? Came drunks heavy

on CIA..any reaction from them?)

No, except David Phillips, you know every time he gets a chance

wacks me.

Because I made a big liar out of him..

KaN You

know when I

was in frint of tee Rockefeller Commission, I spent

16 hours with them,

they want over very much withime on the

JFK stuff and the mob stuff and CIA assassinatin plots and

all this

* stuff and everything started to leak out. Then

David Phillips came ut out and started wacking me.

Then

got mad and I

said, Fuck them, the hell with them, I'll just

tell the truth!

And that's when I said, Yeah, damn right,

I been in tron touch with them,

I was associated with them!"

That's when David Phillips went on television and started

knocking me,

saying I was never an agent. I never told anyone

I said I was associated with them. But the truth is

I was recruited by them, because it's on record.

It's in CIA

records

(Did you ever meet Phillips in Havana?) I don't know. This

is the problem. I don't

KnoW.

You know my contact man, the

CO I was working with, was Colonel Nichols.. And Nichols had

Major Van Horn working with him..

And I met a few other CIA

guys but I had never any contact with because the rest was

strictly telephone.

You know when you make contact with

an agent, an employee, and you are directly in contact with

someteing happens where

teey have to leave, well,

they li give you a code name and they 1l dive you a number

and they'll tell you that this man hexexer here, so and so,

will contact you,

and this is the number.

Then

he disappears

and then it's strictly telephone. You never really in touch

with one another, after the first shot, after your first man

leaves.

..Just like Barker. Barker met Hunt only one time. When he

vas turned over to Hunt...'cause Howard told me thi'...I said,

How many times did Barker ever meet you? He says, Well, one

time.

shasxax His man, who Barker was in touch

when

he came over here, he

says, he turned Barker over to me,

I needed

an assistant,

has he says, so he turned Barker over

me, I met him one time and then after that we checked by

telephone, the normal way of contact. He says

after that when

I left, I

turned Barker over to somebody else, he said.

It all depends on the situation you're in. Like Martinez, he was

in maritime operations and so forth.

Well, when you're in

maritime

operations you come in direct contact with one or more CIA CO's

at one time....las a result of working on a ship where CIA officials

xe are sir restricted in their movements).. in maritime you have

more personal contact with them, because thep stay with the nahrar

mother ship...

Frank Sturgis- notes - 9/21/77

tre

Lorenz

story)

(Had you known

she

was going to break this?)

No!

I got a call Monday night, tonight's: Wednesday, right?,.from

Paul Meskil, and

Paul

told me, he says, "Frank, Merita gave me

something and I wanted you to de know

about it and I want your

comments

on it." I says,

"Shoot."

He

says,

"You know, she has

made

statements and

gave

it to us and my editor is thinking

about putting it in

the papers."

So! says, "What is it?"

He says,

"Well, she claims, she says, you know, this, this

and this about

Alex Rorke and some pictures somewheres in

a training

camp, l suppose,

you know, and pictures of you,

Daaz Lanz,

I think she mentioned Diaz Lanz, l'm not sure,

well

anyway, me, Oswald and

so forth.

So'l

says, "Oh yeah, what else?"

And he says we had some

maps out with a

couple of Cubans,

Pedro Diaz Lanz, yBurself, Oswald, and it had D*arx&x Dallas,

and that we were, we all

got into two automobiles and

we drove

to Dallas a couple days, a few days, whatever, before the

assassination, and that we went there, and that we were members

of Operation

40, and that we went there specifically to go

ahead

and kill the President of the United States:

I says, "She's got to be out of her goddamn mind! She's gotta

be whacko to say shit like that!.. How the hell can she prove

this?

I says, I volunteered, like you know with the JFK

assassination, to take a polygraph. l says, l'11 do the same

goddamn thing now!

That shels lying."

So ha says something about

supposedly the two pictures

that she had, one was missing with some German girl who was

supposed

to write her

book....

(Had she ever mentioned

this to you before?) Not a thing

cabout that.

You know, my own opinion, she's been messing

around with these gangsters.

And yank you know, the father

of one of her kids is a very wealthy man,

owns some race horses

and stuff like that, a lewish guy, and he's a loan shark for

the mob. (Know

his name?)

Ed something. I think maybe him

or the other da guy might have pushed her, because she's always

bitching that she needs money, and I think maybe more or less

they busted her balls

and

said, hey look, you want cash for

your book, this and that, you gotta k get something spectacular,

you know, they always came

up

with some goddamn mob lawyers

for

her to handle her book and so forth, and you know, she's

a little whacko.

This

is the conclusion l come to, but l don't

know what's behind

her mind to do this, because, hey, we're

friends, but, christ, with something

like this,

she'

s actually

getting

herseef, and

Pedro and muself involved

in killing

the President!

She's gotta

be out of her goddamn mind!

Was she in Miami at that time, in November. of '63?)

"I can't remember that

long.

All I know is,

like l told you, the

iday that Kennedy got killed I was here in the house. It beats the

"hell out of

me,

I can't get remember that long if she was here

at the time.

"Well, you

know, too, she was Perez Jimenez's mistréss.

And Perez Jimenez was giving

of the Cuban people

And also in New Orleans, with money

so. forth.

And she told me, at one time, that possibility at one

time that Jimenez wanted to do something against the

Kennedys.

Now I don't know who she meant, weether it

was the President or Bobby Kennedy or what, l don't

but it's something she told

me this pasped year

up in New York.

•How true it is, I don't know.".

(Did

Jimenez have

a lot of money when he was here?)

Shit,

yeah.

He lived on one of the island here,

kept her

in a fancy apartment because you know she had a baby by

Jimenez, a girl, and she's a split image of jimenez.

And the

was involved in all kind of bullshit, Jimenez was.

But who knows whether it's true.

The only way to go ahead

and

get the truth

out of her, like l told Paul, l says

Paul, the people from the Assassination Committee if they

believe her,

should make her come to Washington and put

her under oath, then

ask her to take a polygrah.

And

1'1l xax tell you this, l'll take a polygraph that the

statement that she said is a complete lie! That it is

not so!

No way in the world did l ever travel to Dallas,

Texas with her, with Bosch, with Pedro, or Oswald.

Cause I told the Committee

and I told you, too, hey, to

the best of my knowledge I don't think l ever met Oswald.

Because you know the shit that was coming out of the town

from here, that

I made the statement the FBl got dox going

that oswald was in town here, and this Lyle Stuart, the

guy who was financing the fair Play for Cuba thing, and

that's known as being backed up with Communist money, that.

supposedly Oswald was here and was on a radio station,

there was some article about it in the paper, that he

front of some TV station or something, but

hey, I don't know, this is all some bullshit talk,

I don't

know if he was here or not? But I was talking with a friend

of mine today, Bob Tralins, and he remembered Oswald was

(Talked to him last year)... "Oh you did." (Didn't

rRe Lorenz claim that Hemming was in photol "Yeah, he called

me up last nicht.

(Where was

that training camp supposed to

have

been?)

"Big Pine Key, or No Name.

Well there were several

down there.

We had

one out in the Everalades too.

But eventually

they separated from me and started doing shit on

their own.

Jerry had all the fuckin' garbage all over theunited states in

with

nim,

bunch of crazy bastards." (erry knew Merita,

als0,

didn't he?) "I don't know. That's it, l really don't know.

"But

why Merita would say shit like this, l

really krox don't

know either. But I tell you sometting, she's got a lot of balls,

this gal.

But, hey, this gal here did some good stuff for

the government, believe me.. You know, in the past she turned

over Communist codes to me, and documents and shit like

that. she worked for the Company before and she worked

for the FBl as

an

undercover

agent for about seven vears,

even had her kid do shit for them.

And she was out being

a mistress. for the top Russian KGB agent in New

York.

She

was his

undercover mistress,

he bought her jewelry and

booze, wining and dining

her. and she was ballin' him.

You know, she won't say it to anybody because it would

make

her look

like a whore, you know, but hey, man, she really

did a job. And I took tabe recordings of all that shit, k

you know, and I turned it over to our

intelligence, they

got it,

they took copies of it

ax and all that. Yeah,

she's got a lot of balls...

(re clicks on

line) "That's probably the FBl bugging me,

ha, ha, ha.

I hope they got a court

order.

Hey, you

know, that's how Nixon lost his 18 minutes of tape, you

know.

the rabe cap.

You know I know who did it, I know

who ordered it.

I was told who ordered it, and l believe

I know the man who x erased it.

It was erased electronically.

(Why?) Well, you remember there were statements l made to

you and then

it came out in the press about Nixon * was

trying to cover himself about the files he wanted from

ClA about the Bay of

Pigs and the missiles and the Kennedy

assassitation,

he ordered Helms to give it to him and

Helms wouldn't

give it to him.

Three times he wouldn't

give it to him

and then Nixon

fired him for it. Well,

in that 18 and half minutes tape l think there were

conversations

on that, that pertained

to what I was talking

about, and this ex-agent told me, he says, "Frank, you're

right, with the statements that you made, you know, that

I read

about what you said about

Nixon being set up and

so forth and about the files and all that, well, l want to

tell you something, l was hired to erase those tapes." And

he says, "It was done electronically. And the man no hired

me was so and so.

And 1 got the tape recordine of it, too.

10f the guy telling you

this?) Yes,

sir. Hopefully, it's

still here.

I mean, hopefully it's

still in my possession,

baerasex you know what l mean,

if I don't go ahead and

get

It.all

erased,

ha.

ha.

But he told

me, and whether it was

bullshit or a

lie done know, bus this quy was an

R ex-CIA:.

agent.

Well, after a period of time these people get a little

disgusted with their government, with what goes on and so

forth times, and

sometimes people will tell other people,

yOU

know, which

is limited to the

people they tell, of so and

SO

and so and so.

Who

knows, it's a

funny world.

I suspect one

of these days

I'm conna xak wake un and somebody is gonna

shoot my ass.

But, hey, *a it's the name of the game..

I don'+

worry about it.

But sometimes I think Pedro is right. You

know he thinks

the Agency is gonna kill him.

He says,

"1 know

too much about the Agency.' You know, he thinks Artime is a

double agent.

(Have you heard

from Artime?) Hell, no,

Artime wouldn't call. me.

You know who called me yesterday?

Howard. (Hunt?) Yeah, ha, ha, ha, Howard.

Here comes all

these press people inside the doors and Howard calls me

on the phone and

says,

"Hey, sorry to hear about this, so

on and

sar so forth.

I saw you on television, you really

did a good job.' Yeah, I says, Howard,. I got

all the press

walking

* in the front door right now.

Ult's a wonder

she didn't put him in this thing, too, huh?)

"Wall, she pulled a boo-boo by saying

that when she

came from Cuba she met Howard Hunt and myself. And I called

her up and I says,

"You never met Howard Hunt and me! It

was not Howard Hunt!T. She says, 'Well, I thought it was

Howard Hunt.' I says, "If you saw Howard Hunt todays you

wouldn't know who the

hell the man was! How & could you

go ahead

and say that?'

She says, 'Well, it don't make

no difference, what difference does it make?' I says, 'It

makes a

lot of

difference!' I says,

"I never knew Howard

at that Fime. ' I says,

"Now l'm

under oath telling these

people, the senate Watergate Committee that taxI didn't

know Howard,

never met -- which

is true, you know -1

never personally

met Howard until either late 171 or 172

and you come

up with

a cockamania

story that Frank arranged

for my escare out of Cuba and the

first people l meet in

Miami is Frank Sturgis and

E. Howard Hunt.

You gotta be

crazy! To say shit like that, oh God.

But she wants to

get in the goddamn papers.

You know

Howard's been hittin'

the

papers quite a

bit.

But I says,

"Why do you want to

put the man in the jackpot for? That's a lie.' I says, "Them

people ever ask you to take a polygraph, for christ's

sake,

they'll make a goddamn liar out of you.

Because you never

met Howard Hunt because

I never knew Howard Hunt.'

She

never met Howard Hunt.

At least the best as l know.

Maybe

in bed someplace she met him, you know, ha, ha, ha. she

sure as

hell didn't

meet Howard Hunt with me?"
