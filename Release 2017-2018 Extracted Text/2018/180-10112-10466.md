Notes -- call from Frank Sturgis 6/25/76

He just ran across a friend of his who used to be an agent, In
communications, and # he "revived" his mind on something that
he "completely forgot." (He had previously told me that he
had lost almost all his notes from his adventures in the
intelligence business, which explains why he hadn't remembered
this before.)

He reminded me he told me that he had been sent to Washington

by a group of key men in Castro's inner circle and told to

give some secret documents and lists of names to Hoover, personally.
(Sturgis didn't tell me this, but Pedro Diaz-Lanz -- the guy who
came out with Sturgis and was head of Castro's Air Force -- told
someone the list contained the names of Cuban exile double agents.
At the top of the list, says Diaz-Lanz, was Artime's name.)

Sturgis says he never did get to. see Hoover but he did see his
personal secretary. He seys he was sent to Hoover directly

because the insiders didn'+ trust the American Embassy.

He belleves the Rockefeller Commission and the Watergate Commission
has testimony from his about plots agasast Castro, but he couldn't
get an OK to assassinate pxaks Castro because of the Eisenhower
administration.

One of the people that Sturgis says he was in touch with here,
besides xke@ka the CIA, was Al Tarabochia. He was in touch

with Tarabbohia at this particular time, and therefore Tarabochia
would know of this incident:

There was a meeting in Cuba bout two, two and half months
before the Kennedy assassination. There were a number of
high-rahking rebel officers present: Fidel, Raul, Che,
the chief of GB (can't remember his name), a man who was called
“El Mexicano," several other people, a woman...and Jack Ruby.

“The meeting was in Havana. One of the rebel officers present was
sa half-brother wk of a Cuban exile living in Miami. After the
JFK assassination, the officer sent a letter to his’ half brother
telling of the meeting, the discussion to assassinate JFK and

the presencd of Jack Ruby. He smuggled the letter out, probably
thhough Mexico.

The deal was that Castro would supply Ruby with a flow of drugs
Ruby would get the money to buy the drugs by being given the
winning number in the bolito drawing. That's how Ruby would be
paid off..

shen Cuban exile got letter some CIA agents found out about it, but
‘before they could get it from him, he made contact with the FBI here
in Miami and he turned over the letter to agents from the Mlami FBI
office, They advised him that it was a very delicate situation and
not tell anyone about it,

Sturgis doesn't know name of Cuban exile, but he worked in a factory
in Miami or Hialeah, He's going to try to find out, he's checking
on it now,

The friend he ran into, the guy with the Company, was the one who
told him Tarabochia had this information.

Sturgis says the background is this: Ruby had gone to Cuba many
times and while he was there he was trying to get some action

because "McWillie was a friend of his, as you know." (NOTE: In
interview with Canfield in Coup d'tat, Sturgis has a tough time
remembering who McWillie is.¥page 243). This is where Ruby

Probably thought @ up the idea of making a deal with Castro.
v"We all know he had criminal connections." There should be
vsome record of his trip through the American Embassy in

Mexico City of his trip to Cuba through there. "But this could

have been a secret x&xep trip he went on, on the other hand, if

he was involved am in an assassination."

He doesn't know how tong after the assassination the Cuban exile
got the letter from his half-brother, (It Probably came via Mexico)
Sturgis: "This man here like to had a shit hemorrhage."

(Coincidence?: From Robert Morrow's Betrayal: "Not to be vulgar,"
! thought aloud, "but he'll have a shit hemorrhage." Morrow was

speaking of Castro's reaction to his counterféét operation.)

(1 asked him about Crile's piece in the Wash. Post re the Castro-
Trafficante relationship)

Sturgis says that's news to him, But he doesn't believe it
because Castro kicked out the mob and Lansky and Trafficante

lost their casinos. "! told Santos one day, | said, 'Santos,
| just kekxa left a meeting with Castro and he ordered. me to
close down the casinos for 10 days." And he did. Sturgis was

put in charge of casinos for a while by Gastro.

Sturgis believes if that was the case, that would make Ateman an
sagent for Castro also. But if he did make contact with Trafficante
at was through Rolando Martinez, because he knew Trafficante

very well, he used to work for the Havana Hilton, so he knows

all x the mob people, "He knows them as well as 1 do."

Aleman and Martinez are waxyeka very close friends

‘Barker got fired from the CIA because of his connections with the
“racket people,

Sturgis ~ 6/30/76 - tatel

--says Tarabochia should remember Castro-Ruby incident because
"] know theCtA agent, or former agent, who told him about it."

-thinks the woman he mentioned as being at the meeting was Tanya,
Che's secretary who was killed wilt him in Bolivia...

-also trying to get name of Cuban exile in Miami who received
the letter

--his ex-ClA friend spoke to Tarabochia about it at the time and
perhaps Tarabochia wk should have it on record...

we.it should alsob be part of the FBI files in Washington, along
with the original letter...

-CIA should have a report in too, "We sent the report in." blab

--re Cellula Fantasma: (Was that Company operation or Naval
Intelligence operation?), "No, Company operation.” The people

who were involved. in that were Dr. Louis Conte-Aquerra (sp?);

he asked my assistance and |-went to see my cO, who was

Sam denis. Conte-Aquerra was associated with the Company and

they came to me because they knew | was about the » only one

who could do successful alr operations. So they asked me

jf | would do a series of five air operations and | said, certainly,
| would...

(re | heard of the relationship xx of Jukio Lobo and his
anti-Castro activity. 1 understand Bill Attwood went down
to interview him and...

"Well, Bill was with the Company. .-- No, wait a minute, wait
a minute.. Attwood, Attwood...1 forget...1 think he was with
the Company...!'m not sure offhand...t didn't know all the agents."

(Wasnit it Rojas in charge of Cellula Fantasma?) Conte-Aquerra
was the big man on it. Hets the one who arranged for the
financing for the people that | would do the operation fores.
As a matter of fact, | went on three of them myself..! couldn't
‘get the Cubans to do it sol used Americans. One of the pidots
was Bilt Johnson..)

(What was Rojas! role?) 1 didn't fool around withsRojas. You know,
there was a movement within CIA which told Conte-Aquerra that he
was going to be a big official in the new government. And many of
the agents who were also going to get positions went atong with

the idea that Conte Aquerra would be the president of the new Cuba.
And he was being financed through his own CIA contacts to do a
series of these operations

(How does Lobo fit in?) Well, Julio gave money. He was working
also with CIA. He was giving money which he was taking off income
tox and so forth. This was the way what you'd call "washigg"™ money.
This is how CIA would wash money through different Cuban business
people--and American businessmen--which wouldn't lead directly

to. the CIA. Julio Lobo was one of the people.

recantation,

(Were you dealing with him much?) Well, | worked with him, but

| wasn't dealing directly with him because he wasn't connected
with & the « People | was associated with. He was more with

the economic section, you know, that certain officials dealt with,

(You met him here in Miami or Havana?) tn Havana. But | didn't
have any w dealings with him because, you know, certain people
worked with certain people. It was the thing that you call
compartmentation, you know,

They dealt with different people in different ways. Just like
Tony Verona. He was a ClA-agent. He not only was one of the
leaders, hé was an agent per se. And even today Manolo Artime
is stilloan agent, He wasn't then but he is today... He's still
with them. You know he was the civil coordinator between the
Revolutionary Junta and the Bay of Pigs...

(mentioned Gerald Shamma and her Artime story) Heh heh ebh, she
told you that stor » eh. | wish she hadn't told you that sdébry,
heh heh heh.

Artime: "When he came-back from Cuba, they made him a businessman,

they made him a very wealthy man. | think he's got a little

Problem with Semoza now, but he was working closely with him,
**But if you're with the right People they don't give a shit

what you did, as fong as they control! you. The CIA got some

shits of the world working for them,

The Agency slammed the door on all four of us when we got

out of prison. Colby sent orders out to all stations not

to talk to us or have any contact with us. Bot it makes no
**difference to me, if | need to get to them | go through other

people.,

But, hey, that's the name of the game, | guess. When you get

into the big league stuff with the powefdul people up in Washington
or Langley, if the wrong group of people are in’contro! and you're
not in that league, they can hurt you. And right now the wrong
group is up there. Have been since Colby's been up there. Colby's
got his own people and I'm not one of them."

(Looks like they're getting ready to hang w Lucien Conein) Well,
you know, Howard knew him very well. Evidentally, he's been

involved in some things and they don't want to let it come out,
But there's g Jot of shit Colby has been involved in and he comes
out smeéling like a rose" Evidentally, he {[Conein] is in hard bad
with the wrong people. Colby cleaned house and put his own people
in theeeam and what they do is use People for sacrificial lambs...
like they did us in Watergate...to take the heat of¢ of them...
Howard himselt didn't¢ realize that he was used and we in turn
worked with Howard and they buried alf of us..

But like | told you before, Bennett was the man who really did
a number on the President. (Bennett of Mullens Co.) And though
they closed house and withdrew all the agent that were overseas.
working for the x Mullens Co, they re-opened a new company

and had to re-do the agents with the new company...

| curious to find out where Bennett is right now.

(Howard Hughes connection) Oh-yeah, they used him. They let
him make a lot of money: There's still a lot of places down
here especially that are still CIA fronts...

-said he wasn't surprised by the Schweiker announcement of
running with Reagen: LE think Schweiker's using this thing,
but, hey, you can't blame him, he's a politician. The thing

worked out beautifully for him." Then he asked: "Its he still
officially investigating the JFK thing?" 1! said, yes, he was
still interested. After a few minutes of inconsequential
conversation, he asked again: “Hey, let me ask you something.
Are you still checking up on the JFK thing?" Jt said, yes, i}
was. Then he said: "I told you about that letter from Cuba,
didn't 1?"

| said we wm had checked up on it and that we had gotten a

memo from Tarabochie about it but the memo said nothing about
Castro, although it did mention a trip to Cuba by Ruby.

He asked did the report mention about the letter that came

to the relative in Miami, he said his friend "Salvatore" [the
former CIA oan] told him definitely there was 2 xk letter

and that "Bob Dwyer probably was the man [the FBI agent], because
he was in charge of the Cuban desk at the Bureau downtown, was
probably one of the agents who picked up the letter."

1 told him that Tarabochia's memo indicated only that Ruby

went to Cuba, not that he had seen Castro, and that the FB

man was James O'Oonnor, not Dwyer. Sturgis asked how we got

a copy of that memo and | told him 1 didn't know. He implied
that perhaps it was changed or censured and | said that was
possible. for all | knew, because | had never seen the original.
He then said that Ruby could have been to Cuba without people
knowing it, of course.

Sturgis then asked ihe If | @ had ever heard of Lyte Stuart.
| said yes. he's the wx book Bk publisher who has published
a lot of sensational and controversial books. "You know he
supposedly met Oswald a month before Kennedy was assassinated
in- Miami, accordéng to @ report I'm trying to track down.""

There's supposed to be something in the newspapers in +963 before
Kennedy was killed about Oswald being in Miami, Sturgis said, and
he is going to the library to check up on that.

tyle Stuart, says Sturgis, was head of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee. "It was also reported he was very pro-Castro and
that Castro was supporting him financially and that Lyle
Stuart was seen with and connected with Oswald. And it was
reported in the papers that Oswald was here a month before
the assassiaadtion. Now tt may all be bullshit but ttm still
going to check it out.

Sturgis said the man who told him this was @ writer who was “pretty
much involved" in the investigation of the assassination. He was
with him last night, and the guy said that Lyle Stuart would be the
one to check with, The guy's name is Bob Traflins.

ry did ask him & if it would be alright for him to talk with you."

At this time Sturgis went to get Traifins phone number and in the
background | could hear the television news which -- coincidental ly
happened just then to announce the news of Howard Hunt. filing, the
$2-1/2 million tibet suit against Weberman & Canfield. "Did. you
hear that?" Sturgis asked, just to make sure.

“What Ellis is doing," said Sturgis, "is to file Howard's now
and then by the mm end of the week or next week he's filing
mine. Both Howard and myself are using Ellis." [Ellis Rubin,

focal controversial attorney is most known in Miami for his
Publicity ploys and long-standing feud with State Attorney (Dade. Co.)
Richard Gerstein.] Sturgis said the sult wak would be against

the authors and publisher of Coup D'Etat. and against Playboy

and Hefner and later maybe against Dick Gregory ("As soon as

' dig up enough about him." | saig tibel suits are tough to

win, "Yeah, but hey," said Sturgis [St+. George was right: he

says "but hey" a Lot], even if we get a judgment for a dollar

it'l! stop all the shit about us being involved in the the
assassination of John F. Kennedy.”

He asked if | had a chance to speak with the Cuban who received

that letter. 1! said no, | haven't had a chance because as a result
of his television appearances Wally Weston had come forth with
his information and | had been busy-on that. "Il spoke to

Wally Weston tonight,” said Sturgis, "and | have a meeting to
sit down and find out what he can tell me and so forth,”

Back on Oswald's meeting with Lyle Stuart, Sturgis said he
thinks it may have been possible because there was a report that
he himself had met Oswald in Miami and that could have been very
possible, what with all the anti-Castro people he met and the
double-agents, but he himself didn't remember it. But he did
hear that Stuart was connected with the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee and getting financial assistance from Cuba, "This

Bob Tralins was a friend of his and dislikes the man very much,
but he definitely told me this.”

Switching subjects, | asked him what he knew about operations
that took place from Cay Sal island. [the Hughes connection. ]
All he knew, he said, fhat There was a black Customs official who
tried to keep people off the island because the CIA used it as
a stepping stone, like a “Listening post" off the coast of Cuba.
He himself didn't have any operations from there. "Qn some of
the island close by there we stopped by occasionally for several 7
. houss, but | kept away from Cay Sal because it was being operated
4 by other people, other aroups." [772] Was it CiAvor other opesators?
pp “they were CIA operations. One time Barker got a hold of me because
| was doing something, in some operations with Bill Johnson which
| was financing, and Barker got a hold of me and said,'hey, we're
doing something very sensitive in that area' and he asked me to
stop for a while and go into another area.” [Note: This is obviously
conflicting: Who was Sturgis working for if not CIA? Here he became
very deliberately convoluting and wound up talking about Pinar de Rio
operations in Cuba, ]

! asked him if he was involved in the training camp in New Orleans
wtth Gus DeLabarre and Rudopph Davis: "No," he said quickly. "Not
at all. | never knew about any training camp in Dallas...or

New Orleans." [NOTE: WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT DALLAS???

HW.50955 Docld;32264840 Page 8


|} asked him about the guy who was reportedly the head CIA

man here, Mr. B, or Bender or his supposedly "real" name,
Drescher, and what he looked ftike. "Oh, ! don't know," he
said. "Il mean | never met him. You've got to understand the
agents didn't talk to the contract employees, but there would
just be a telephone system of reporting. The telephones were
connected by relays so that if the FBI were checking the number
it would be located in one area but it would just be a relay
station, so they could never check it down."

Sturgis talked then about Schweiker and the Reagen situation and
| said | thought they would have a tough fight on their hands

against Ford who, after all, has all the power, "I! disagree
with you," said Sturgis. "I think the power is up there and
they're advising him what to do. He's being controlled, like
all Presidents are. Certain power groups control, you know

what | mean?"

le changed the subject and mentioned he had been out in California
last week. He said he was invited out by Chuck Ashman [a former
Miamian who has a radio or TV talk show out there and has

written some exploitation books about the Mafia and the clad.
Sturgis said he has Oscar Fraley (author of "The Untouchables")
who wants to do the story of his life. [Fraley's latest book

is on Jimmy Hoffa].

He said he has been trying to get a hald of his ex-agent friend
(Salvatore) who told him about the Ruby in Havana story to get
more information but the quy is in the Domican Republic for

the week.

Sturgis then asked if it were possible to get a copy of the
Tarabochia memo and | said | would check on that with my office.

-The conversation got back on the CIA: "Tbe CIA is very funny," he
said. "They do things right up to a point and then they turn. right
around and screw you. Depending what their policy ist If they
“want to change it they'll change it and bury your ass too. In

the last few years they've had their own internal: power struggle
and in that struggle a tot of people xk get hurt who are decent

people. Like if | favor Howard Hunt and his boss gets whacked out,
then everybody down the tine goes. That could go into hundreds or
couple thousand people. Just like when Helms left. J told -you

that Nixon wanted some files from Helms and Helms wouldn't give

it to him, so the President fired him. Now I'm assuming, from

my discussions with certain CIA officials fired now. the files

he wanted pertained to the Bay of Pigs and also the JFK assassination.
And Helms didn't to turn them over. He was scared that if he

turned it over to the President, that Haldeman and Erlichman

would have used it for political reasons. And after Helms was

fired McCord turned za around and said, 'Ilf Helms qoes, all the

trees in the forest will fall!' That's why McCord blew the

“whistle on the President. Well, you know who Deep Throat was,
don't you? |! think Helms ordered Bennett to bury Nixon,
Deep Throat was probably several guys, but the main man was
Bennett, the CIA man. Unfortunately poor Howard got sucked
into this thing, | don't think he even knew anything about it.
And Bennett was his boss, both at the Mullen company and,
| suspect, his CIA chief also. Oh yeah, | believe certain
CIA officials, Helms the major one, set up Nixon to be caught.
And the company's hot at me because | told al} this to the
Rockefeller and the Senate Watergate committees. But fuck'em,
they screwed me enough all these years. Maybe Schweiker will
get to be the Vice Bresident-and I'll get him to get me
into CIA and I'll clean that place up myself..."

“Notes -- call from Frank Sturgis w/ Ed Kelser.8/2/76 tatel

Says he's at a friend's house and this friend Just came back

from Israel. He was in one of the bia notorious prisons over
there, Romley (sp?) Prison outside Tel Aviv, the top security
prison where al] the major captured terrorists are locked up..
ssshis friend is very much in with the American Jews in this
area and he had gone to Israel with the idea of trying to

help Israel as an undercover agent, to help infiltrate the
PLO. He did that and came back with a lot of information,
Sturgis told him he would try to get someone to talk with
him because he feels there is much information his friend
has that our government should be aare of, since he made
friends and has a lot of connections now with the terrorist
leaders in prison, He put himself in Prison with the knowledge
of Israeli Intel lengence,

"This guy has worked for me in the past and he's worked as
an undercover agent for several federal agencies. He used to
be with the French Foreign Legion, the guy is really a hot-shot
guy."

~-Name is Edwin Keiser , Sturgis said he thought 1 might find
this guy's story of interest. "Whether i+ can be of any help

to you or Schwéiker, | dont+ know. After all, your boy is
running for politics now."

| said-l didn't know whether Schweiker would be interested in
that information since it's really outside our subject area.

"You never can tell,” said Sturgis, “you know how politicians
are, If they think there's a little bit of something that they
might be able.to use and Schweiker, | don't know what = kind of

religious background he's got but that sounds Jewish anyway."

| said | wasntt+ interested in the political aspects of any kind

‘of intelligence information and | didn't think Schwiker was either

"Well, why dont+ you just say hello to my friend here anyway,"
said Sturgis. "He's got an interesting backgoound, I've known him
for a number of years and he's good to know." 7

“Hell, Frank," | said, "isn't there anybody you ‘don'+ know?"

Sturgis laughed and said, "Well, there were some peopde | swear 4

didn'+ Know and I'd like to keep it that way. Ha, ha, ha, you know,
one of those things."

id Keiser got on the phone and said that his problem was that the

American Embassy in Israel, specifically the vice consul (whose
name is John Adams and who is, in fact, chief of the CLA station),
told him Fhat when he, Keiser, returned to the ULS. he would be
in touch with certain people and now he found that no one wants
to talk with him, because technically he's under arrest for having

left this country with a kag¢te falsified Passport.

He says he had lost his citizenship back in the mid-50's, without
his knowledge of losing it, when hk he Joined the kxne French
Foreign Legion. He Says it was taken away without a hearing or trial
and he has since found out that shouldn't have been done. He says,
however, he has never stopped fighting Communist and he has been
out of the country several times since then on false passports,

HW 50955: DocId:32264840 Page 11


This last time he went to Israel he went on a forged passport and
after a month and a half he gave himself up and agreed to work
undercover in the prison for the Israeli government, He was

in Romley prison for five and a half months, including with

the 43 people they wanted to exchange on the hijacking program

in Uganda, all the top-ranking terrorists. He kad left in

good standing with these terrorists, including the six Jews

and 30 Arabs who had plotted to take over the Israeli government
who had come in out of Syria.

He dame back to the U.S. to be prosecuted, paroled to this
country .by the Israeli government an an ks Israeli.

"| brought back quite a bit of information with me," he said,
-For instance, he said, he was ’in prison with an American. whose
father is a very big man in. the California movie business. The
son was arrested for smuggling a half a ton of hashish, and
this famity is dealing heavily here in the States and tn South
America with cocaine and other drugs...

The Federal agents he's xxx tried to talk with said they
can't talk with him because he's under arrest ax (for false
use of a passport) and his case is: not resolved. 7

"It's really stupid,” he says. “i'm carrying information around
with me, | supposed to be in contact with intelliaence over there
and carry on-with what ! was doing,_and | can't even talk with
people in my own coumtry to see if they want me to contines..”

He was arrested by FBI here after he arrived at Kennedy airport,
after being deported by Israel. They put a $25,000 bond on x him

in New York and another $25,000 bond in Miami. They pw brought him
here for prosecution because here's where he falsified the passport.

He sags he was also subpoénaed to Watergate when Frank.was Involved
andihe brought up Information that could have really he}fped Frank,

the information was taken but nothing was done. "It was really.a-sad
thing,” he said."t think it was just used politically. 1 had agents
in Cuba that were coming out of Havana who were willing to come here
and testify, but the Senate wouldn't send a PBY or: couldn't get
authorization to pick them up. This all went to Howard Baker and
his assistant Liebengood and they didn't do anything. | have but

about that...”

He said he was working with the Cubans here in Miami for a while
| after Watergate but he decided to 90 to Israel and fight Communish
there "because those people are serious."

He says he effectively infiltrated the terrorist and Communist groups
within Israel prisons and he brought out important information but
now "it seems like my own country could care less about it."

stuff about the k PLO. He says he has pages of information which, if

he dropped on the United Nations "would blow the lid off." “He wouldn't
do that, of course, without the authorization of his government; "But
I'm sitting on a g keg of dynamite here and | don't know why my
government is not at least talking with me... If they want to put me
jail, put me jail, but at least first talk to me."

He says he'd like to get the information primarily to. the CIA, expecially


He says his wife put up their house to raise money for his bond

He says he's being represented by a public defender because he
cant afford an attorney: Edward G. Galante (305-350-4391)

He says he talked to people from DEA who say they're interested
in what | got and to head of intelligence of U.S. Customs

(Steve Czukos) here in South Florida == but they all put him

off and he hasn't heard from any of them.

=-meanwhile, he says he is supposed to get back.in touch mk with
Israeli intelligence, he has a code and it mam should have

been started a week ago, but he doesn't want to start it up

again without making our government aware of what he is doing.

He says he also has agents with the PLO who are waiting now

in Rome for him and he has been putting that off too.

He says his attorney is talking about making a deal with the
government but he's not interested, he's interested only in
getting out the information he has...

"L think that the information | have has something to do with
the security of this nation, because it has something to do
with the security of Israel."

He says just the information he has on drugs alone is valuable.
The guy he met in prison who was busted with a half tons of
hash should be out in two or three weeks and he's on kx his
away back to California with @ conspiracy he put together in

the Israeli prison.. Keiser says he's got knowledge of how
drugs are coming in, who's arranging for them, and who is
carrying them,

He ‘says the DEA told him they are interested but because he is

--asked if 1 contaeted the person who got the note from Cuba re
meeting of Castro’and Ruby... asked if | would give him the an
names and details again of tbe Tarabochia memo...

~-doesn't know the name of Pratkin or Paskin mentioned in memo..
(Why would Ruby visit him?) Well, why would Ruby go vigit
McWilltie.. You know McWillie was one of the big boys there...

so evidentally he had more than one connection...but remember
when he went over there there were no more racket guys there,
so why would he go see this man?

--Trafficante came out, | think, in 60, when they closed the
casinos...that was after | came out...! left in June of £Q@@7%a59-

1959 -- the casinos were stil | operating..

(Could Trafficante have had a deal with Castro?) | doubt it.
Remember | closed the casinos for 10 days on Castro's orders
There was a big uproas. | told Trafficante and some of these
otherpeople, because | was in charge of the casinos for

the government, and | told them, 1 says, | want to tell you
something for your own good, Fidel has said that kesx he's going
to run all the gangsters out of Cuba and take all their businesses
On one of my tours of the casinos | ran into Santos and | told
Santos,! said, | want to tell you something, if you see your
other friends tell them | was in the prime ministers office with
Fidel and Bidel said he's gonna nationalize all the American
businesses here and he 's goinna run you fuckin! gangsters out
of Cuba.' And he says, 'Naah, he can't do that, we got over

a hundred million dollars in investiments here! Who the fuck
does he think he is?’ He was really hot. 'That sunayatich
should be dead!" Naah, he was an enemy of Fidel's.

(What's behind Crile piece then?) 1 don't know. Crile took some
cracks at me. Well, | can't say that's wrong, because | don't
know, all | can say is what happened to me and what | know.

But, let's face it, Martinez worked for the mob. He was working
for the Havana Hilton when | met him in 1959 on the baccaret table.

*
~7knows Aleman, not well. 'not buddy buddy with him like BeGweR '
never talked to him about this; "I'm surprised Aleman came up with

that because one time Aleman borrowed some money from Santos when

he needed it."

Trafficante kill JFK? “I don't think so, no, | don't think so. The
man most logically to want to kill JFK would be that guy & in New
Orleans, whassisname, yeah Marcelle, He would be the logical one."
Surprised Aleman said that. "He's got a lotta balls to say that

in the paper; exmnekakkyx but why didn't it come out down here?" **

But | don't know why Martinez # is working with Barker. Barker is

a totten sunavabitch. But one of these days I'll find out why a
certain CIA agent wanted me to do a domestic assassittation. | wish

| bad a good memory to £m find out when i+ was asked me because that
would nail that sunnavabitch CO of the party, because as | understand
his CO was very leftist and considered an undercover Communist agent,
but I'll dig it out one of these days..."

DocId:32264840 Page 14


You know, Ambassador Smith ooo who was
chief of CIA in Havana in 1959, a “goddamn Communist.” Oh,

you don't know what went on... :

(Was there a Cogswell also?) | don't know, I'IIT have to check
some of my notes on some of these things. You know Paul Bethel
was there also, he was the press agent...that was a nice little
cover...yeah, he was an agent... he may be retired right now,

but | believe he's done some contract work for them oft and on...

No, | can't believe that Santos worked with Bd Fidel! You know

| told you that they contacted me once, wanted me to kill Fidel...
(Yeah, Norm Rothman asked you, didn't he?) Ohmxer no, no, no.

it was Hymie Levine and another party...but they had a lot of
connections with other people, besides me, who were constantly
with Fidel and if they wanted to nail him they could have...

Trafficante hangs out at Capra's (80th & Biscayne) when he's
in town... that's one of his people there.... 8 o'clock.

| haven't been there for years, but | know, | was told one
time, if you ever want to see me or something like that,

-asked if | spoke to Barker or Martinez yet?

Crite wrote an article about me that didn't put me in a good
light. Of course, you know me and Barker @ are on the outs.
| don't tike Barker... You know, | was gonna put Barker's
head through the wall xaf in prison. The sunavabitch is

a freakin' coward. | tried to get at him and four of the
prisoners grabbed me and he went into the corner like a
goddamn baby, the sunavabitch. But I'tl fix his ass.

You know | told the Senate Watergate Committee that one

CIA associate of mine asked me to doa domestic assassination,
and |. told x# them it was Bernard Barker. Add | told them,
if you don't believe me, give me a polygraph...And his

CO was a goddamn Communist bastard! (yells) Because he

sure loved Fidel, even over here. But | told Barker | wanted
the orders directly from theCO because | wanted to make

sure | knew who the m people was... 1 told Barker, if you're
CO told you to contact me, then | want to see him...then

the CO told him he didn't m want me to do it... And | don't
know what year this was... The Rockefeller Commission really
went into detail with me on that. | told them, | says, well,
1'}1 be honest with you, because this is why I'm so mad at
these goddamn CIA officials. They get you to do their dirty
work and after a while they throw you to the wolves, like
they did at the Watergate and...uhh,; you know...uhhh.. so now
{'m down on them, Fuck em. Well, whatayagonna do?

(asked him who Barker's CO was: talked aronnd it) Barker had

same CO here as he had in Havana... | forget who is CO was,
because an employee had various types of agents: Barker and
Martinez were contract agents, | was not a contract agent, because
1 didn't sign a contract and | didn't swear to ERKEBER secracy,

but | was @ so-called field operator recruited by them to

work for them on @ cash basis, for a week or for months...but

| yasn't in the same position Barker and Martinez was...because
+here were times here when they wanted me to turn in Cubans

making raids against Cuba and | said, Hell, you gotta be kiddin’,
11m a goddamn revolutionary! Just because you people are not
assisting Cubans anymore, I'm gonna turn them in? Fuck you, I'm
not gonna do it... tike | was very close to Sam Jenis and his
whole x family, we were very close, very close, since 1956,

and | worked with that whole family, and two of the family members

were CIA people, but they knew how | felt, they knew | would
never betray the Cubans..
...this here Navid Phillips, he knocked the shit out of me on

televiséon, he said, “We never did no assassination, and Sturgis
is. full of it, he never had no association with us, he never
was an agent!" Well, fuck him, the sunavabitch, a week later
all the.shit broke loose about assassinations and all, and the
Gianncanna bit, and then admitted on television that when he was
chief of western hemisphere division, that he notified the Cuban
government--Castro! ~~ through the Czecheslovakian embassy, when
Cuban groups were leaving the South Florida area to #a&.90 to
Cuban and & do operations against him. Here's a man admitting |

wee t
that he was betraying Cubans to be caught over there and executed!

(Cl heard & he was involved in seme Castro assassination attempts
that never came off)
"t'm gonna tell you something. | think it's a little game they
play. | think the plots that they wanted us to do were simply
done to go ahead and make certain people think that they were
working. But | think what they were doing all along, they were
really betraying us, you know what | mean? They have one
polic¥: Nail "em, but behind the door stop it. The Cubans
had.a # force here and they had this feeling against Castro, so
to pacify certain people who had a lot of influence here, they

had to pacify them by saying, well, we're gonna do things, but
at the same time they're doing the betrayal bullshit... And
David Phillips convinced me that they had been doing this all

along, just betraying everyone, the American public and everyone.,

(l hear he was pretty much involved in the Chilean thing also)
Who, Phillips? With the Allende thing? You better believe it!

Cl asked him why did David Phillips have an interest in his
Cellula Fantasma operation, as 1 had heard he had?) 1 don't

know, he said, | really don't know, Well, he was pretty high

up, you know.. (even in 61, 622) +-well, yeah..." Said the

guy in charge was Conte-Aguerra, he worked for the company, later
they sent him to Europe on an economic mission... "Then Diaz-Lanz
got into the Picture, he was suppose to take over the Group,

and that's what started a lot of problems. We had a lot of
E*******® Droblems and | think this is where David Phillips came in, becasse
“then he started to get interested, you know, because of Pedro

Diaz Lanz comina into the group."

"I'm writing @ book. ' sion a contract with Osear Fraley this
Sunday." Doing a movie with Morgan on the Trujillo thing, and
Fraley will do the book of his life, less the Trujitlo thing...

~-talk to Pedro Diaz Lanz, that's how I got involved in the Trujillo
thing. And talk to him about Artime. You Artime is stilt working
for the people. Maxx He!t| tell you Artime's an double agent.
Geraldine Shamma will tell you that also..she hates him.

(Do, you see him much?) Not too much. When we were in prison, yeah
But since I've been out I've kept away from him, | don*t want a
goddamn thing to do with the company...

~= About about Roselli?) | think they naifed him good. How do J
read it?) Cuban agents, Put | leave a question mark. | hate to
jump on something aek else, really, but they're capable of doing
anything. "Cause | did a lot of dirty work for the Sunavabitches,
believe me, and they't} get people like me -- because you know |
was considered one of the most six dangerous men in thexwarkdx
country -~ and they can get people like me to do a lot of their
dirty work, you know what | mean, because it leaves their hands
clean and if they want to discredit you they can because they have
the force and the Power, they got everything working for them..,
But I'll give them the benetft of the doubt, I don't think they

1 had the FBI call me. On the JFK stuff. They said, well,
you made some statements on televiston andwe'd |ike to
get together with you. Met tbem over at Denny's. It- was
about when | went to Calif. and was on TV out there and made
certain statements about the meeting with Castro and Jack
Ruby and they wanted to know about that... said Wash. calledthm...
agents..Ben Conte and ???

...when | asked them about the letter, they told me tet
O'Connor had investigated that and that O'Connor wes the
one who spoke withme abott the JFK assasstadion. But
they told they didn't know anythingabout a letter...

*** O'Connor now In New Orleans????

Hey did you read anything about four constables fran Dallas
who received a box of letters and documents pertaining toa
meeting between Oswald and Ruby and so forht?? This bx of
33 documents turned over to Dallas DA Henry Wade.... id
...ewell, a friend of mine called me up last night and |
copied dan some shit on it...you want to rad you sore

of this??? (is this frons clippings?) It my have
because he told me he got it out ofsarme papers...

..ethey turned tt over to the FBI and theygave a number

and now they can't find the documents. Canyoubelieve that?
Just like they can't find the letter, they cantt find the
documents...

...You never got a nhold of Salvadore, did you?
(You never gave me his name) Yes, | did, | gave you his
phone number but he told me he wouldn't talk toyou, Schweiker's
man..
oe . Salvadore Garcia -- former CIA guy... says he doesn't like

Schweiker

The & FBI guys also asked me about Roselli. | told them

1 didn't believe | knew Roselli. t told them | know nothing
about it...They asked me what 1 thowht, 1 said | touht the

mob got rid of him..they're always fightingamong themselves...

(re Crile pieces) 1 don't believe it. 1 dnt think Trafficante
had anything to do with it. 1 don't believe a guy like Trafficnte
could go ahead and do something like that on his own, he wold
have to get permission from the Commission, and | dontt belive
the Commission would allow him to do something like tht. They
tried it once before with Anastasia, Anastasio wanted totake
oer some of the gamblin in Havana and the Commission said no.
What happened, he went against the Commission's orders And

L ook what happened to him. . The same thing happened to Dutch
Schultz who wanted to knock off Tom Dewey. t can't see it. . |
don't think the mob would want that kind ofcatastrophe tohappne
to Rill the president.

(re the Rolling Stone piece and Trafficante relation tothe
Bay of Pigs and his contatct in that operation, FS)

(Laughed) Was that in Rolling Stone? You know, ['m trying to
get my lawyers to sue them sunavabitches for about $20 million.
Well, you know the mob was here on the Beach. And remember

{| told you h i a the Embassy was divided and how Smith
even sceeset ht the chief of station of CIA, of being
a communist because all his agents were feeding information

to the guerillas and Castro... And here you have the mob
over there, all these Cubans who were working for the mob
over there, they came over here and the CIA made agents out
of them! So, hey, the mob knew everything was going on...
You know, you had Normie Rothman who had the Biltmore Terrace,
which was.\Batista's money, the top floor over there was
going to house Batista if the government gave ma him permission
+o come into thecountry.. Now that place was the hang out
of a lot.of mob people..a lot.. and a lot of Cuban CIA boys
used to work for Batista...and alos intelligencé agents
from other countryes would come in there...and the American
CIA agents used to go wine and dine there, used to have
a ball there

..and-as far as I'm concerned, t don't have contact yokk with
Santos Trafficante here and | don't have any contact with the
mob...

(re Watley's statement of Sturgis contact with Trafficante)

Han Well, | don't know how Richard Waeatley can goahead and
say shit like that because that's garbaxge....That is
garbage!

(Who was Whatley?):

kWhatley was one of these mercenaries who used to fool
aoround with this Jerry Patrick, trying to get involved
with the Cuban exiles...

You know, when | came out of Cuba they came up withall sorts
of wild stories that | was the contact between the mob and tte
CIA,..that'a all bullshit

-re a conflict of interest on Ellis Rubin part because of suit
with Hunt and him against CREEP (772)
..But t'm goftng to Washington anyway tomorrow... Yeah, | ‘told you

that Senator Baker wanted to see me..yeah, they called me,
Michael Madigan and Howard Liebengood called me, they sayd,
come on up, we'd like to talk to you about this JFK shit.
Yeah, | was surprised...

(re Martinez working at Havana Hilton.and Crile saying no)

That's bullshit. That's where | met Martinez when | was
working for the &mbassy. | told that to the Senate Watergate
Committee when they asked me...(why) Well, because Martinez has

been working on $100 month retainer for the CIA and he has prebably
dug up a lot of information for the Company and writing the book
with Crile and talking about Trafficante and Aleman, so naturally
the CIA don't want anybody to know there was any connection...He's
not ggkax going to admit he worked for the Bakxk gamblers... |

met him at the Havana Hilton working on the baccarat table..
(fairly well off?) Yeah, he did abortions, he had a whore howe
over there...yeah, he was pretty well off... 7

(re WerBell trial) Yeah, you know | recruited the undercover
agent that got Bernstine..Jerry Buchanan... 1 got a hold

of the Company first because It was out of the country,
because they have a drug..you know,, thing, but thy

slammed the door on me when | contacted them...1 even

had to go to Washington for the damn thing...so | got a

hold of other friends of mine and they made the conneetion..
that's how Jeryy was recruited...and he made out pretty good,
they busted one of the biggest international dum drug
conspiracies in the country..+. and Bernstine turns around
and he starts to work for the government....

(undercover?) Buchanan got involved up to his eyeballs with

Bernstine... | don't know how he made the connection...
(Bernstine involved in Bay of Pigs?) | think that's all
bulgshit...

(Bernstine crash an accident?) No, | think somebody killed him.
He's too good a pxa pilot...

(WerBell) Well, he's x a friend of my old friend Andrew Sst

(partial)

(get any reaction from the New Times piece? Came dronnke heavy
on CIA..any reaction from them?)

No, except David Phillips, you know every time he gets a chance
he wacks me. Because I made a big liar out of him.. Hem You
know when I was in frrnt of tee Rockefeller Commission, I spent
16 hours with them, they went over very much withime on the
JFK stuff and the mob stuff and CIA assassinatirn plots and

all this x stuff and everything started to leak out. Then
David Phillips came ux out and started wacking me. Then I

got mad and I said, Fuck them, the hell with them, I'll just
tell the truth! And that's when I said, Yeah, damn right,

I been in txmm touch with them, I was associated with them!"
That's when David Phillips went on television and started
knocking me, saying I was never an agent. I never told anyone
I was. I said I was associated with them. But the truth if
Iwas recruited by them, because it's on record. It's in CIA
records

(Did you ever meet Phillips in Havana?) I don't know. This
is the problem. I don't know. You know my contact man, the
cO I was working with, was Colonél Nichols. And Nichols had
Major Van Horn working with him. And I met a few other CIA
guys but I had never any contact with because the rest was
strictly telephone. You know when you make cwntact with

an agent, an employee, and you are directly in contact with
them, if someteing happens where teey have to leave, well,
they'll give you a code name and they'll give you a number
and they'll tell you that this man Nexexxx here, so and so,
will contact you, and this i§ the number. Then he disappears
and. then it's strictly telephone. You never really in touch
with one another, after tke first shot, after your first man
leaves,

..Just like Barker. Barker met Hunt only one time. When he
was turned over to Hunt...'cause Howard told me thi'...I said,
How many times did Barker ever meet you? He says, Well, one
time. &hxkxmx His man, who Barker was in touch with in Havana,
when he came over here, he says, he turned Barker over to me,

I needed an assistant, kax he says, so he turned Barker over to
me, I met him one time and then after tleat we checked by
telephone, the normal way of contact. He says after that when
I left, I turned Barker over tw somebody else, he said.

It all depends on the situation you're in. Like Martinez, he was
in maritime operations and so fortk. Well, when you're in maritime
operations you come in direct contact with one or more CIA CO's

at one time....[as a result of working on a ship where CIA officials
KR are six restricted in their movements].. in maritime you have
more personal contact with them, because thep stay witk the nokhasr
mother ship...

(why is Phillips on your back?) Becas$e I told-the Committee that
the CIA helped Fidel. The Communists were out to kill Fidel at the

NW 50955 DocId:32264840 Page 21


very beginning when we came out of the mountains. When
Ambassador Smith asked the CIA the background of the Castro
brothers and his top military officials, the Cia said no,

they had no communist background. Well, the FBI in the Embassy
waS given all the information on the Castro brothers, but

the ldn't give Smith the correct intelligence informatonn.
fo co) Willi rdwell, was the CIA station s chief and
Smite Called noteing but a fuckin communist. He said
90 % of tee agents that work for me here are noteing but
pro-communist bastards. That's why..CIA_had_ Smith removed
through pressure in Washingtan,. And was another
one of them. He was later Barker's C ere, and that sunavabitch
was way to the left. -

(when was Barker's CO here?) Right You
see, Hunt left a week before the invasion. got tr
be Barker's next political officer. Hunt w up to
Washington and was in the Cuban desk, and the man...remember
Hunt was a political officer...and Hunt was transferred from
the. politicad office tr work with David Phillips, who was
propaganda...

during and after the Bay of Pigs’ e's a queer sunavabitch.

(Wasn't he Barker's CO?) No! Bender? No! Bender was
over-all chief of CIA here for the poliitcal section. That's
old Droller. He wa’ German born...and he was faggot too.

No, he_w. : r's CO. B 's CO was Hunt and teen
it was[| [ worked under Bender, just
like Hunt...

[Not 5 Droller also called DRESCHER...]

(Don't Know where Droller ig now; may be retired; he's a few
years older than Hunt..)

(When waS Bender here?) Frank Bender? He was here before, }e

(RE PRIO); under gin financial pressure recently; wife only allotted
him $1000 a month; he snorted Coke for years; only those close tr

him knew how much business pressure he was under..***] asked a LE
friend of mine who was close what happened..." {Duran???] . [

No, he wagn't involved in narcotics...only yeass ago back in

something and | wanted you to ke know about it and | want your

comments on it." | says, "Shoot." He says, "Yau know, she has
made statements and gave it to us and my editor is thinking
about putting it in the papers." So Il says, “What is it?"

He says, “Well, she claims, she says, you know, this, this
and this about Alex Rorke and some pictures somewheres in

Dhaz Lenz, |. think she mentioned Diaz-Lanz, 1'm not sure, well

supposed to write her book....

Gilad she ever mentioned this to you before?) Not a thing

-of one of her kids is a very wealthy man, owns some race horses
and stuff like that, @ Jewish guy, and he's a loan shark for

cbitening that she needs money, and {| think maybe more or less

“they busted her balls and said, hey look, you want cash for
