JFK PROJECT

The following is in response to your request for a

statement "reaffirming" CSI's commitment to apply available

resources to complete the processing of records related to

-be assassination of President Kennedy.

As Jeremy Gunn stated in his letter of 28 October to the

EXDIR,

the pace of reviewing JFK-related documents is

accelerating. He also stated that the JFK Board has

established 1 September 1998 as the deadline for all

agencies to finish the processing of records

and transfer

them to the National Archives.

In order to complete all the necessary tasks required by

the Board and meet the deadline, we will clearly need to

increase the resources now dedicated to JFK. There are a

growing number of requests from the Board to review records

from both CIA and other agencies, to search files for

additional information, and to brief the Board and its

staff.

At present, one staff officer and 13 part time

independent contractors are devoted to JFK.

In addition, we

draw on a small CSI computer unit for support and share

overtime employees who perform indexing and document copying

for the Center.

In the absence of additional

resources being provided

from elsewhere, CSI (or OIM) will need to shift resources

then at that on i tango one atono

from other projects to JFK for all tasks to be done on time.

One option is to interrupt other declassification projects,

such as that on DI finished intelligence on the soviet

Union,

and the Guatemala covert action, and assign reviewers

and others working on those projects to JFK. The moves

would need to happen in the next few weeks.

Another important consideration is that the

directorates, particularly the Do, will need to increase

heir resources to keep pace with HRG. These resources are

required to coordinate declassification of records and to

declassifi cat 10

prepare responses for requests from the Board for additional

information and files.

Whatever resource adjustments are made to bolster the

effort on JFK, there will still be an unpredictable factor

that could require a surge in additional resources later.

This stems from the potentially large number of documents

from the FBI and other agencies containing CIA equities that

the Board could ask us to review.

There is a good chance

that such documents will surface near the September

deadline, which would leave little time to complete the

processing.
