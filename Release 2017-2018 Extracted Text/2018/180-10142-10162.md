Did Lee Harvey Oswald or an Imposter Contact the Cuban

And Soviet COnsulates in Mexico City?

Other Than His Visits to the Cuban and Soviet Consulates,

What were Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City?

Was Lee Harvey !Oswald travelling alone in Mexico?


I. INTRODUCTION.

A. Issues Addressed.

The House Select Committee on Assassination's inves-
tigation into Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico
City has been directed at answering the following ques-
tions:

1) Did Lee Harvey Oswald visit the Soviet and Cuban
Consulates or Embassies in Mexico City?

2) In addition to the visits which may have been made
to the Embassies what were Lee Harvey Oswald's ac~
tivities while he was in Mexico City?

3) Was Lee Harvey Oswald alone in Mexico City? If not,
who were his associates and what were their activi-
ties?

4) Did the Central TwrelViqgwce agency maintain any
surveillance operation(s) aimed at the Cuban and Sov-
iet diplomatic missions in Mexico City? If so, what
kind?

5) What information, if any, about Oswald's stay in Mexico
was known by the CIA Mexico City Station prior to
thé assassination and what was the source of that
information? :

6) Was the information, if any, in the possession of the
CIA Mexico City Station reported to the CIA Head-
quarters accurately and expeditiously prior to the

assassination?


7) Was the information in the possession of the
CIA Mexico City Station reported te the CIA
Headquarters accurately and expeditiously after
the assassination?

8) Was the information developed by the CIA in
Mexico City communicated to the Warren Commis-
sion in an accurate and expeditious manner?

9) Did the CIA photo-surveillance of the Cuban and
Soviet diplomatic compounds in Mexico City, if sucB

Phovosorve larg existed, obtain a photograph of Lee Harvey

Oswald? -If so, what became of that photograph?

B. Differences Between the Warren Commission Investi-
gation of Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in Mexico
City and the House Select Committee on Assassina—

tions Investigation.

The approach taken by this Committee's investigation
differs from that of the Warren Commission primarily in
terms of scope. The Warren Commission and the investiga-
tive agenciés at its disposal went to great lengths to

- establish Oswald's travel to and from Mexico; but devoted
minimal effort to evaluating Oswald's contacts with the

“Guban and Soviet Consulates. It is the conclusion of

this.Committee that the.Warren Commission established

that Oswald had indeed traveled to Mexico City, Hence,
this Committee has chosen not to reinvestigate Oswald's tra-

vel to and from Mexico City. Instead, the Committee's approach

Soviet and Cuban diplomatic missions in Mexico City and
on evidence that was not available to the Warren Commis-
sion that could possibly shed light on Oswald's activi-
ties in Mexico City outside of the Soviet and Cuban in-
stallations.

The Warren Report limited its discussion of Oswald's
contacts with the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic missions to
information obtained from Sylvia Duran and the Cuban Govern-
ment. (See Warren Report, pp. 299-304, 733-736, In sup-

port of ‘their account of Oswald's contacts with the So-

viet and cuban diplomatic missions the Warren Commission
published the following as exhibits:
1) A note from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs
to the Swiss Ambassador in Cuba. (Commission Exhibit
2445)
2) Lee Harvey Oswald's visa application and the Ministry

)
of Foreign Affairs of the Public of Cuba's letter

&
denying the visa. (Commission Exhibit 2564)

3) Letterhead Memorandum to J. Lee Rankin from Richard
Helms re: "Technical Examination of Photgraphs-of
Lee Harvey. Oswald's Application for a Cuban Visa."
(Commission Exhibit 3127)

4) The pages of Lee Harvey Oswald's notebook with the
telephone numbers of the Cuban Consulate, the Soviet
Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache's office.

{Commission Exhibit 2121)


5) A letter dated 11/9/63 from Lee Harvey Oswald to
the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. (Commission

Exhibit 19) oe

6) A letter from J. Edgar Hoover to the Warren Commis-—
sion listing the contents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's file holdings on Lee Harvey Oswald
prior to the assassination. (Commission Exhibit 834.
This document listed a Central Intelligence Agency

"release" dated 10/9/63 that reported Oswald's con-

tact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.)

7) A memorandum dated 5/14/64 to the United States Em-
bassy in Mexico City from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Mexico. (Commission Exhibit 2120)

an 8) A memorandum dated 6/9/64 from the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs of Mexico to the United States Embassy in
Mexico City. (Commission Exhibit 212%) a

9) A letterhead memorandum to J. Lee Rankin from Richard

Helms re: "Hours of Work at the Cuban and Sowiet

eeaad nae KK
Consulates." (Commission Exhibit 2568.) % At one
point-in-the Report the Commission referred to other
information:

By ‘far the most important confirmation
“of Senora Duran's testimony, however, has been
supplied by confidential sources of extremely
- high reliability available to the United
7 * States in Mexico. The information from
i: EEE these sources establishes that her testimony



was truthful and accurate in all material
respects. The identities of these sources
cannot be disclosed without destreying their
future usefulness to the United States.
(Warren Report, p. 305) .

The Warren Commission did not print anything in the
twenty-six volumes of evidence to support its statement
that Silvia Duran's testimony was confirmed by "confiden-
tial sources of extremely high reliability.”

In an attempt to answer the questions posed by Lee

Harvey Oswald's visit to Mexico City in September and
: October of 1963, the House Select Committee on Assassinations
has pursued the following investigative procedure:
1) Conducted extensive interviews, depositions,
and executive session hearings involving Central
aoe i Intelligence Agency personnel;
2) Interviewed Cuban citizens who could have know-

ledge of Oswald's sojourn in Mexico;

3) Interviewed Mexican citizens who could have

knowledge of Oswald's activities and assoGia-
tions while he was in Mexico;
4) Conducted, an extensive review of the files of
“the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal
an P'S = “Bureau of Investigation that pertain to Oswald's

sojourn in Mexico;

5) Conducted an extensive review of the public

source documents that pertain to Oswald aiid

Mexico City.


C. Conclusions

1

2)

Someone who identified himself as Lee Harvey
Oot called the Soviet Consulate on 1 October
163. This individual indicated that he had
visited the Soviet Consulate at least once.

Other evidence would indicate that the individual
visited the Soviet and Cuban Consulates on five
or six different occasions. « While ‘the majority
of the evidence tends to indicate that this
individual was indeed Lee Harvey Oswald, the
possibility that someone else used Lee Harvey Os-
wald's name during this time in contacts with

the Soviet and Cuban Consulate cannot be abso-
lutely dismissed. =
This committee has not been able to determine

Lee Harvey Oswald's activities outside of the
Cuban and Soviet Embassies with certainty. There
is evidence, which has not been confirmed; indi-
cating that during his stay in Mexico Oswald
attended a “twist party" at.the home of Ruben
Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of Silvia Duran.
There is also unconfirmed evidence which, if true,
would indicate that Oswald spent one night and
parts of two days with a group of pro-Castro stu-

dents from the University of Mexico. a



pass [eee

3) There is some evidence that Oswald may have
been in the company of a tall, thin, blond-
headed man while in Mexico. This evidence has
not been confirmed. If true, it is possible that
this same individual may.on occasion have used
Oswald's name in dealing with the Cuban and Soviet
Consulates. The man's name, if there was such
aman, is not known.

4) On the dates that Oswald was in Mexico, the CIA
had photographic surveillance operations which
covered entrances to the Soviet Embassy and the
Cuban Embassy and Consulate. The CIA also had
electronic surveillance on telephones in the So-

viet Consulate and Military Attache's Office and

/tne{teLephone at the ) ca
Cuban Consulate was not subject to that surveil-
enence:

5) The CIA's Mexico City Station definitely knew of
Oswald's contacts with both the Soviet and Cuban

diplomatic compounds and -~ his desire to obtain

an intransit visa for travel to Russia via Cuba.

surveillance on the Soviet Consulate and Soviet

Military Attache's Office.

“‘fné information in the possession of the CIA

Mexico City Station was not reported to CIA
Headquarters in an accurate and expeditious man-
ner prior to the assassination.

With the exception of a few, possibly benign,
irregularities, and considering the possibility
that not all of the information available to the
Station has been provided to this Committee, the
information in the possession of the CIA Mexico
Station was reported in an accurate and expedi-
tious manner after the assassination to headquar-
ters.

With the exception of those areas that involved
sensitive sources and methods, such as the infor-
mation pertaining to the(etectronic and) photogra-
phic surveillance of the Soviet and Cuban diplo-
matic compounds, GBB information developed by the
CIA in Mexico was generally relayed to the Warren
Commission in an accurate and expeditious manner.
It.is the conclusion of this Committee ‘that the
CIA's photo-surveillance operations in Mexico
City probably obtained a photograph of Lee Harvey
Oswald entering either or both the Soviet and
Cuban Consulates. The CIA denies that such a
photograph exists. Hence, the disposition of the-

ERISTEO.

photograph which the Committee believes ‘o-exist’


is unknown.

The following report detailing the results of this

Committee's investigative efforts regarding Mexico City
is divided into general areas:

1) CIA surveillance operations in Mexico City during
September and October of 1963;

2) Information about Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in
Mexico City that was known prior to the assassina-
tion;

3) Reconstruction of the CIA Mexico City Station
and Headquarter's activity regarding Oswald
prior to the assassination;

4) Mexico City reporting of information after the
assassination;

5) Silvia Duran;

6) Investigation of related information that was not

it : available to the Warren Commission; and

7) Reconstruction of Oswald's activities in Mexico

City
