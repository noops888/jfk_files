Lounge in Jefferson Parish along with a partner but they closed

the lounge 12/31/60. Informant stated that PLANCHE and his

partner formerly had a music box in their place which belonged

to Jefferson Music Company. Approximately

closed they had Jefferson Music Company take the box out and

they bought their own music box and put it in the lounge.

financial arrangement with Jefferson Music Company, but because

they could keep all of

purchased.

NO. 1133 said that PLANCHE was not bothered or

intimidated by the Jefferson Music Company

or any of its

Company music box.
