A review of the newspaper morgue of The Arizona Re-

publ1c disclosed an article written in the February 22, 1963,

Issue of the paper. This article is set forth verbatim as

follows:

"I did just what I had to do." "And what did Ricardo

Diaz have to do?

"Fashion a knife from a spoon, kill his prison guard,

and navigate 100 miles of open sea in a stolen sail-

boat.

"But it freed the 31-year old Diaz, now a Phoenix auto-

mobile salesman, from the Cuban revolution he embraced

before it turned down the Communist path.

"Now Diaz, whose full name 1s Diaz-Lanz, 1s afraid

someone will consider him a hero.

"It was expediency," he said.

"I was like a pig in a

pen.

I had to get out. It was my brother who was

hero.

"His brother is MaJ. Pedro Diaz Lanz, chief of the

Cuban air force, who became dIsenchanted with the

revolution in July 1959 and told the world of Fidel

Castro's ties with communism.

"Ricardo was a social worker in the Castro regime. He

was thrown into prison without explanation.

He was

beaten and kicked.

Some of his ribs were broken.

"Twenty months later, last Sept. 28, he escaped from

the Isle of Pines.

He slew his

guard during one of

their dally health walks on the island.

"A night and day later he landed at Key West, Fla.

"Ricardo was a revolutionary and acquaintance of

Fidel Castro

at the University of Havana. Ricardo

has a master's degree in sociology.

"But he took no part in the abortive revolt of July

26, 1956, at the Havana police barracks; nor in

Castro's landing after his return from exile.

"In fact, his family had been among the favorites of

the Batista regime, and Ricardo had a paper-shuffling

job in a Havana government tourist agency.

"Ricardo said:

"He doubts that Castro had any Communist help until

after his successful return to Cuba from Mexico. He

landed with 17 men and meager supplies.

"Castro didn't need any help from Russia.

"Cuba was overwhelmed with hatred of the Batista

regime and ready for revolution. It had been talked

up by the students and young intellectuals of Cuba

for years.

"But

there was no leadership, no planning. Castro

didn't provide it either.

"But the sheer audacity of his attack on the police

barracks tabbed him as a man of action.

And his sue-

cessful return three years later made him the man of

the hour.

"By the time Cubans learned he had betrayed them to

communism, it was too late.

"So what are the plans of a learned young man with a

dream of equality for everyone, a young man who had

a hand in an abortive attempt at a bright new world?

"I want to

make a lot of money," he said. "Maybe

"He's made a pretty fair start in the capitalistic

world.
