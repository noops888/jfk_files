With the exception of a weekly publication by the

Committee on January 1, 1973, the intelligence functions
of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group are handled

most active in generation and coordination of terrorism
information for the Working Group-are the CIA, the FBI,
NSA, DOD, the Secret Service, the Department of Treasury
and the State Department.

These Working Group agencies set their own priorities
"and parameters concerning intelligence on terrorism mat-
ters. From time to time the CIA requests comments from
the Working Group on its weekly terrorism reports.

The organization of the Cabinet Committee is de-
lineated in the President's memorandum of September 25,
1972. The Working Group is composed of senior repre- |
sentatives of the ten agencies on the Cabinet Committee
and representatives of the Following agencies: Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, Energy Research and
Development Administration, Federal Protective Service,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration, Metropolitan Police Department,
National Security Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Office of Management and Budget, and the United States
Information Agency. These additional agencies were in-
vited to participate in the Working Group by the Special
Assistant to the Secretary and Coordinator for Combatting °
Terrorism (S/CCT), in his capacity as Chairman of the
Working Group.

Under the Working Group there is one formal sub-
group, the Behavioral Science Resource Group (BSRG),
which is composed of behavioral science experts from
the State Department, the CIA, the FBI and USIA. The
State Department member chairs BSRG. The Resource Group

§ 8} Counsel Division of this Furean, dated June 26, 1975, captioned "DAG

E Inquiry Re Communication by Former AAG Doar to FEI Regarding
88,1 | Misslssipp! Freedom Democratic Party Delegation. "

Regarding your request contained in referenced communication
for the Bureau to locate and furnish certain documents, it is my under-
standing that you are in possession of the documents requested.

iC

In response to your request that we turnish our observations
concerning the making of the documents available to former Assistant
Attorney General John Doar, may I suggest that this raises an issue
which has been discussed in the past by the Bureau and the Department
-and other Governmest agencies. This issue to my knowledge has not
been resolved. That issue is whether a former employee should be
allowed access to documents in the Government's possession to refresh
his recollection for possible testimony before the Senate Select Committee.
ft is this Eureau's position that such docaments should not be made
available for the aforementioned purpose, and in those instances where

‘ff {| a former employee cannot respond accurately to the question of the Senate
van __| Select Committee or any other Congressional investigative body, the
Committee or Congressional body can be referred to the appropriate
bareau or agency which will, if appropriate, furnish the necessary
formation. I am sure you will understand our concern in this regard
ofar as setting a precedent which might serve for future requests ot

furnished to him. The Department also asked our views as to whether
he should be given access to or delivered the documents for the purpose

(1) The DAG has asked me to request that the Bureau make
a file check to determine what, if any, documents may be found
in FBI files relating to a request made by Mr. Doar in August
1964 for information and Bureau-action regarding members of the
subject delegation. It is our understanding that Mr. Doar
requested certain information from the FBI regarding this dele-
gation in mid-August 1964; and that some information was delivered
to the DOU (either to Mr. Doar or then DAG Katzenbach) shortly
thereafter, in the latter part of August 1964.

(2) It is possible that Mr. Doar may be asked about these . f
matters in connection with the Senate Select Committee inquiry :
(reference Appendix D, Item 7, 5/14/75 SSC request). The DAG
has also asked that, after such documentation as may be developed
under (1) above has been located, the Bureau furnish to him its
view as to the access/delivery to Mr. Doar of such documentation
for the purpose of refreshing his recollection.

(3) An expeditious response to this request will be
appreciated. REC. ly

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) oF

By letter dated 5/14/75, with attached appendigess

the SSC requested certain information and documents from #
the FBI.

Appendix C, Item number 10, requested all memoranda
and other materials relating to the elimination of the Liaison
Section of the FBI in 1970 and its reestablishment in late
1972.

Among the enclosures to our letter to the Attorney

General (AG), dated 6/13/75, being proposed for forwarding
to the Committee is E. S. Miller memorandum to Mr. Felt,
7/14/72. On page 2 there is information that “our close
association with the Chief Postal Inspector and his top
officials has resulted in that agency providing support in
some of our most delicate intelligence operations looking
to the identification of illegal hostile intelligence
activities in this country." This could possibly be construed

to include opening of mail. It is to be noted that opening

of mail by FBI is the subject of a separate SSC request and

' future correspondence with the SSC, through the AG, will

address itself to this subject. Former Chief Postal Inspector

Henry B. Montague, with whom we have had extensive dealings

in the past, is scheduled to appear before the full SSC on

_6/12/75 and it is expected that he will be questioned about

possible FBI participation in mail openings. _ 3]

DATE,

This morning (7/2/75) Michael Epstein, Senate
Select Committee (SSC) Staff Member, advised SA Paul V. Daly,
Legal Counsel Division, that he, Epstein, is to interview
SA John R. Borys and former Assistant Director Ivan Conrad
at 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m,, respectively, Monday, 7/7/75.
Borys is assigned to WFO and Conrad resides 1307 Capuret
Court, McLean, Virginia 22101, unlisted telephone number
356-7590. Interviews are to concern the former FBI
investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.

These are the latest in a series of interviews
regarding the King case being conducted by the SSC Staff of
present and former SAs, It is believed that Borys and if
Conrad should be released from their secrecy agreements to
enable them to be interviewed which is the same procedure
which we have been taking with the others who have been
interviewed. The release from the agreement which we'are
recommending will, of course, be conditional that the interview
relate only to the King mactenests

RECOMMENDATIONS : /

6a-We 395-35)
1. Borys and Conrad be released from their ff

secrecy agreement in order to be interviewed, but only

relating to the King case, On approval, Legal Counsel Division

will advise them of the release and invite them to consult

with the Legal Counsel Division early a.m, 7/7/75 in

preparation for the interviews. Poe

B11iff apologized for the submission of the 6/25/75 draft letter,
isaying it was forced upon the Committee by the White House.
ccording to Elliff, the SSC has been aware that much of the
information requested from the Intelligence Community was being
eld up by the White House until such time as the SSC identified
specific abuses it was interested in investigating. As a result,
the attached draft was put together by the SSC to break the
logjam. E1liff admitted that much of the information requested
in the 6/25/75 draft letter was embodied in the request of 5/14/75.
For this reason, Elliff advised he contacted Mr. K. William
O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Depart-
ment of Justice, on the morning of 6/30/75 to request a meeting
between himself, O'Connor, and Messrs Wannall, Mintz and Cregar.

“Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Enclosed with this letter are notifications concerning
certain matters currently under investigation by-the Select
. Committee which relate to government entities under your a
* jurisdiction.

These notifications are submitted pursuant to an
agreement between the Committee, the various intelligence
entities, and the White use. Pursuant to that agreement,
the various entities in the Rxecutive Branch have agreed not
only to make available tne pertinent witnesses, but also to
submit in response all information and material which they
possess that is relevant to the areas and cases which the
Committee wishes to invest te. The response should include
all relevant underlying docwmentation and other information,
including documents which may not have come to the Committee!
attention and which the Committee has not specifically reau
and all material relating to any prior Executive Branch in
into the matter. In addition, we would welcome a current
analysis of.the particular questions raised by the Committee
and any other observations on the subject that you believe
would be helpful.

We 7 nm
elosure that underlies that agreement. . Success in fulfil ling
the full disclosure policy contained in the agreement is
iridispensible to the Committee's analysis and to the formulation
of our ultimate findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

Within the Committee mandate, contained in S. Res. 21,
there are four broad subjects relating to the intelligence
community which we are required to investigate and study in
order to determine the facts and ultimately to decide whether

1. The structure; performance, and utility of
+ government operations with respect to -
intelligence activities;

2. Whether certain policies or practices are or
are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise
_ improper;

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive
“ duplication or inadequate coordination. between
and among intelligence agencies and, more
generally, the efficiency of intelligence
activities; and

. 4, Whether there has or has not been adequate
ao internal and external control and oversight ae
over the policies and practices of intelli-
“ gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these fundamental
questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways. First, we
are examining intelligence functions broadly as instruments
of government policy, giving attention to the authority for
particular functions, the problems which intelligence activi-
ties are designed to solve, the procedures by which intelli-

_ Bence activities are and have been proposed, approved,

* executed, evaluated, and terminated, the range and scope of
the activities utilized to achieve intelligence objectives,
and the propriety and utility of the activities undertaken.

. Second, we will examine -in depth certain specific subjects
within’the broad topics of investigation. (We would, of
course, welcome your suggestion of other cases that would
give added insight into intelligence matters under your
jurisdiction.) These specific subjects for investigation
are not intended to limit the scope contained in the more

general questic

The annexed notifications spell these matters out in
- greater detail. In addition, they ask certain specific questions
set forth certain previously requested documents not yet receive:
request additional documents,* and, in some cases, ask for the
names and present addresses of persons who have held certain

information and material, including-documents, whether or
not they have been brought to the Com tee's attention or

positions. Where appropriate, the subject's description
indicates, pursuant to the agreed Outline for Inquiry
Procedures, the matter primarily concerns allegations of abuse
or other controversial specific matters where there is reason
to believe improprieties may have occurred. Finally, the
notifications indicate the name(s) of the staff members(s)
who, in addition to the Committee's senior staff, will be
responsible for the particular -matters. :

The Committee, in the course of the next few months,
will undertake other subjects for investigation as its work
proceeds and will notify you as appropriate.

We look forward to your cooperation in these
matters.

SenEReeny A ‘Legal Authority for FBI Intelligence and “counter~
Oe eee on intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities.
There may be serious question as to the adequacy
of the present legislative framework for the FBI's

sot functions in these fields. Current statutes

— ° authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence
activities. Therefore, the Committee seeks to
determine whether the FBI's authority should be

— “ Clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-

hensive statutory charter.

The Committee is investigating the structure and
‘operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-
sion. Proposals have been made that the national
security intelligence and counterintelligence
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate
- agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's

criminal investigative activities. Further recom-
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina~

‘tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,
for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and,

countcrintclligence activitics by the Attorney

General or an independent board, and tor clearer
standards and procedures for FBI activities in this
s area. Therefore, the Committee desires complete
"*  Anforriation on the operating practices and proce~
dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the

FBI Internal Security Intélligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature
and purpose of FBI intelligence operations

“directed at foreign intelligence activities

and subversive or extremist activities within
the United States. It has been alleged that
the scope of FBI intelligence investigations

is too broad and has extended to legitimate
political activities.. Consequently, the Com-

The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community.

The Committee seeks to determine what have
been the policies and procedures for coordina-
tion between the FBI and other agencies in the
U. S. intelligence community. There have been
occasions in the past where friction between
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious
dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence
community. The purpose of this inquiry is to
evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-
ordinating mechanisms.

Geheral Questions

The descriptions which follow of the specific cases the
Committee intends to study are intended to serve the
‘dual purpose of notifying the FBI of the issues the
Committee ‘will explore in connection with each case
and eliciting from the FBI all information and material
in its possession relating to the questions the Committee
wishes to explore in each case. In order to avoid
unnecessary repetition of certain questions which will
be basic to the Committee's investigations of each
ease, certain fundamental questions are set forth
below. As to each case described, the Committee
intends to explore these fundamental questions, and
expects that the FBI will, as to each case, provide
all-information and material it has relating to these
basic questions even though they are not repeated in
the discussion of each particular area.

1. What is or has been the asi authority for the
activity?

2. What have been ‘the purposes of the activity?
3. What techniques have been employed in the activity?
4, What kinds of information have been gathered in

the activity?

5. How have specific uses of the activity been initiated
and approved?

cation of the general question to the specific case.
Except where inapplicable by their terms, all general
questions relate to each specific case.

y ab Blectronic Surveillance

_The Committee is examining all forms of electronic
i interception of:communications including wiretap-
ping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual elec-
tronic surveillance interception of video and data
communications, local monitoring devices, and all
i other forms of electronic or technical monitoring.

The Committce's general questions apply to each of
! the techniques listed above, as well as to the

‘matters set forth in the following specific cases.

1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the
Attorney General should have the authority

to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-
tain purposes without a prior judicial warrant.
This power has been exercised vy succeeding
Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit
directive of the President. The Supreme Court
has ruled that this power does not tend to
purely doméstic inatters, Bub the reinaining scope
of the Attorney General's authority remains un-
definedby the Supreme Court. z

Ecees : Questions

. The Committee requests that the FBI and the
- Justice Department address the following specific
questions:

pecEGEeeeseeces -. a. What is the scope and basis of the claim -
. of Executive authority to conduct warrant-—
Less electronic surveillance?

b. What have been the procedures for considera-—
tion and approval of requests for warrantless
electronic surveillance’ authorized by the
Attorney General?

‘ c. What are the specific disadvantages of the

electronic surveillances which have been
authorized by the Attorney General?

Act of 1968 inappropriate for electronic
surveillance conducted for national secu-
rity intelligence purposes?

Documents

The Committee requests the following additional
documents bearing on the questions stated above:

authorizations by the Attorney General for
warrantless electronic surveillance from

Clandestine Informant Activities

‘The Committee is examining: all aspects of the

FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover

-personnel and the techniques employed by such per-

sons. Although informants are the single most
productive source of intelligence information, the
aifficulties of controlling their activities may
inerease the possibility of improper conduct. The
use of informants to infiltrate organizations also

-Mmay pose dangers to the right of associational pri-

vacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for
the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement
or other safeguards for the use of informants.
The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as
well as the contributions of informants to the

“accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant
activities with respect to several particular situa-
tions and cases. This investigation may involve
specific allegations of abuse or ctuont#oversial
matters where there is reason to believe improprie-
ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry
covers the general circumstances surrounding the

‘following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;
b. Kent State; i

c.- New York v. Stroble (Attica);-

.d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

@. United States v. Briggs (Camden);

_f,. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

g. United States v. Marshall (Seattle). — eee

* Additional cases may also be examined.

- In addition to the above cases, the Committee is

- .examining the role of FBI informants in providing

information to the FBI concerning members of the
following organizations:

On 6/26/ 15 James J Angleton, former Chief, |
Counterintelligenc Operations Central Intelligence Agency,
telephonically furnished the follewing information to
SAL. F. Schwarts.(q) a)

Angleton recently testified under oath before three
Senators and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC).
He appeared without counsel, During his testimony, Angleton
was asked numerous questions concerning his knowledge of
Israeli capabilities to conduct intelligence collection in the
United States. Among the questions asked Angleton were questions
bearing on Israeli efforts to gather nuclear information in
the United States. Angleton indicated that the SSC apparently
is aware of Angleton's past close relationship with the Israelis,
and Angleton feels that the questions directed to him by the
SSC may be related to information provided to the Committee by
correspondent Tad Szule who, according to Angleton, is writing i.
an article concerning Angleton's rélationship with the Israelis é :
for Penthouse Magazine. Angleton understands that Szule has y:
either testified or has been interviewed by the ssc. fg) ww a

Angleton stated that he avoided any direct answers
on the above questions by stating that any knowledge he might
have would be secondhand and fragmentary, He advised the SSC

that such questions might more properly be directed to pie )

Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

area, Angleton replied that he did not know but that he believed
| the current senior Bureau official. concerned with operational
matters to be Deputy Associate Director James B, Adams. (YY) ()
In addition, Angleton advised that certain questions
he was asked dealt with alleged Soviet attempts to infiltrate
the CIA and other agencies. Again, Angleton avoided a direct
answer and indicated that the FBI would be the appropriate
agency to direct such questions to. Finally, Angleton commented
that in the event the Bureau thought it desirable he would be
happy to personally brief the Director or other appropriate
Bureau official concerning his testimony. He commented that
he has not been asked to, nor has he offered to, brief William
Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, concerning his testinoey sf

&

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. We are checking for any available information
in files concerning}/Israeli intelligence collection capabilities
in the United States.] Results will be summarized in separate
memorandum, (2, 7

2. It is not believed appropriate to request
Angleton to brief the Director or other Bureau official
concerning his testimony, particularly since Angleton has
not seen fit to brief his former superiors at CIA. A request
by the Bureau for a briefing by Angleton might be misconstrued
if it were to come to the attention of Colby or other CIA
officials. yr

GENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: CONTACT OF MR, AND MRS, SCHAPER WITH STAVE MEMBERS OF SSC

Aceording to the Schafers, Hy. Epstein began the
interview with tha Schafers by stating the purpose of the
Senate Coumitiee and why the Schafers were asked to Washington,
Bc. Mr, Epstein stated that the Committee was trying to
develop information on want the U. 5, intelligence agencies
have been doing, what changes in these agencies are needed
and "where niotakes wight have happened,"

The Schafora advised they requested Mr. Epstein to
ask thea specific questions, He asked them what was the
entire period of time of the Schafers' relationship with the
FBI aud if they wore still associnted with the Bureau.
ir. Schafer told Mr. Epstein that he was not going to admit
any associntion with the FBI at this point and the veply seemed
to groatly upset Mir. Epstein, We asked the Schafers why they
had come to Washington, O, C. The Schafers replied they
wanted to establish some groundwork for any relationship with
the Senate Comnittce. Mr. Epstein attempted ta have the
Echafcrs relate their activities in behaiz of the FBI.
ie, Schafer advised they refused to comply due to Mr, Epstein's
nhanner and presentation, The Gchafers stated they receiyod
the definite impression that Mv, Epstein ond his colleagues
expected to hear an afternoon of interesting stories and
anecdotes,

Mrs, Schafer told Mx. Upstein that they had done
nothing wrong, illegal, immorai ox unethical in their
"movement" activities and they were proud of thoiy contributions
to the nation's internal security. The Schafers related thoy
enjoyed a happy relationship with the FBI and they knew of
nothing questionable ox unprofcssional recarding the Bureau's
handling of their information, The Sehafors said they made
At clear that they would be happy te tell the 85¢ these
things; howover, since they were not reassured by Mr. Epstein,
and were in fact put off by his manner and his colleagues!
prusque reactions, they would not furnish anything further
to Mr, Eostein, The Schaiers stated that short of appearing
before tho Senate Coumittee, they wanted to be icit alone.

SENATE SELECT COMMETTED OW INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: CONTACT OF HR. AND MRS. SCHATER WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF SSC

According to the Schafers, Mx. Epstein and his
eolleagucs gava the clear impression that they wore disappointed
and annoyed with the Schafers' reluctance to tell them anything.
Mr. Epstein asked 42 tho Schafers wanted to tnik to any of
the Senators and the Schofers stated they would bo willing
to speak to Senator Goldwater; however, Mr, Epstein made no
specific arvangencnts other than to check with Charlie Lonbard,
Goldwater's vepresentative. My. Epstein did notmy if tho
Schaerg would be subpoenned; nor wero any fira arrangements
made Bhout reimbursing them for thelr expenses. According to
the Schafors, the wecting broke up rather abruptly and
iy, Epstein's colleagues Left without saying gaod-by.

7 The Schafors stated they made an effort to be

; friendly, cooperative and suenablo to Ur, Dootvein and hic

mae collicagues, and they made a goad faith gesture in nppearing
before Mr. Epstoin in Wasliington, BD. Cc.

NOTE:

The Schafers, as paid informants, furnished
information from October, 1969, until March, 1975, to the
Bureau. Information in this LHM was contained in
New Orleans teletype to the Director, dated June 11, 1975.
Several personal statements made by the Schafers, such as
“pearded hippy"' in reference to one of Epsteints colleagues,
were not included in the LHM as this type of information
is not fully germane and our reporting of it might be
inferred as our being prejudicial.

Legal Counsel to Adams, Memo
Re: SENSTUDY 75

We have prepared an airtel to San Francisco with an
enclosed letter for Mr. Todd in response to his request. We
are having the San Francisco Office hand deliver the letter
so that any questions he may have can be answered.

We have not regarded requests for interviews as
"demands" within the meaning of 28 CFR 16.22; therefore, no
release from the Department is necessary.

Regarding his request for access to Bureau files,
we have not had former employees make this request previously.
Our position should be that they not have access but rather
rely on their recollection. If they cannot answer a specific
question, the Committee can be referred to the Bureau.
RECOMMENDATION:

Attached Airtel with enclosed letter to Mr. Todd
be approved and sent.

Mr. Clarence M, Kelley Ne
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D. C. co

Dear Mr. Kelley: i

On this date Supervisor Berr,
cisco Office read to me a teletype to the effect the Bureau
head approved a secrecy release for me to respond to questions
from Senate investigator Lester B, Seidel in connection with
a Senate Select Committee on Internal Security investigation
of the CoIntelPro as it related to the Black Panther Party.
A copy of a letter from me to Mr. Seidel has been furnished

to the Bureau previously.

At the time I was designated supervisor of the squad
handling internal security investigations of the Black Panther
Party (BPP), the BPP was international in scope; Eldridge
Cleaver and others had been granted asylum in Algeria; the
BPP had support and/or branches in France, Germany, Scandinavia
and China, Aspects of the counter intelligence program
approved by the Bureau of which I am aware were directed against -";,
some BPP foreign operations. Thus, interrogation by the Senate
investigator may involve information disseminated to other
government agencies under security classification and may

touch on foreign policy as well.

Therefore, prior to furnishing information obtained
in‘an official capacity to Mr, Seidel, who according to the
Bureau's teletype Will be in San Francisco in about two weeks,
I would like written confirmation of the release which was
furnished me orally, preferably an official document covering
any secrecy agreement made with the Bureau as well as releasing
me from the provisions of any applicable executive orders which
preclude disclosure of official information without approval of

he Attorney General or an authorized Departmental officer,
I would also appreciate being advised 1f there is any limitation
on the scope of the material which I may release,

|
8A

FORMATION

Ix

Since the Bureau's teletype also approved a secrecy
release for current SAC Charles Bates, this presupposes he
will be authorized to furnish Mr. Seidel with the contents of
files if Mr, Seidel so requests, Therefore, I would also
appreciate advice as’ to whether I will be permitted to refresh
my recollection by reviewing official files prior to or during

the interview with Mr. Seidel,

Attached is a FD 302 reporting a conversation
SA Paul V. Daly had with Mr. Paul Wallach, staf£ member of
United States Senate Select Coiiiittee on” Intelligence
Activities. The gist of the conversation is that Mr. Wallach
informed SA Daly that he had a list of national security
Mail covers which cover the last five years and that he would
use this list for committee business including for interview
purposes if the Bureau did not promptly comply with the Committee's
request for a list of mail covers.

The contents of the attached FD 302, were. orakly.fiirnished
on 6-18-75 to Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,
Michael Shaheen of the Department. Mr. Shaheen and Mr. O'Connor,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, contacted
F. A. O. Schwartz, Chief Counsel to the Senate Select Committee,
to protest Mr. Wallach's actions. Mr. Wallach denied, ina
conversation with Mr. O'Connor, that he had stated he had such
a list to SA Daly. Subsequent to this conversation with
Mr. O'Connor, and on the same day according to Mr. Shaheen,
Wallach called Shaheen and told Shaheen that he wanted to talk 7
to him off the record, at which point Mr. Wallach stated that |
he had access to a list of mail covers through a source of his,
but did not have possession of same. He also stated that he
may have suggested to SA Daly that he had such a list.

Mr. Shaheen stated that it was obvious that Wallach
could not be trusted and remarked that the Department had been
keeping book on him. Shaheen informed SA Daly that Wallach

had contacted Mr. Cox, Chief Counsel for the United States Postal
Service, at which time he informed Mr. Cox that the White House
had authorized the release of all national security mail covers,
and requested Cox furnish same to him. According to Shaheen,

Cox then contacted the White House to determine if Wallach's

story was in fact true, at which time James Wilderotter, Assistant
Counsel to the President, advised that Wallach's name was unfamiliar
to him, and that :he. had not been given authority to obtain
national security mail covers. Mr. Shaheen stated he, at the
direction of Mr. O'Connor, was furnishing the Bureau in writing, a
report of his conversations with Wallach and also stated that
O'Connor stated he would no longer have any dealings with Wallach
because of the obyieus unethical conduct and lack of honesty on
Wallach's part.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the United States Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, telephonically contacted me on
6-18-75 between 2:30 and 3 o'clock P,M., and inquired as to the status of a
request by the Committee concerning mail cover information. He asked if I
could furnish him a time when he might expect our response to be delivered
to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discussions with me and
Mr. Shaheen of the Department concerning this matter, and Mr. Shaheen
had indicated to him that he could expect the response to have been given to
him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a time certain for
delivery of a response concerning this request could not be given, and it
was explained to him that a vast amount of material was being reviewed
pursuant to request of the Senate Select Committee and other committees of
Congress and that because of the amount of work involved in all these requests
it was not possible to make a judgment as to the date of the response.

Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been misled by Mr. Shaheen
into believing that he would have a response to his request and that he was
going to recontact Mr. Shaheen. He made a general inquiry as to whether one
Agent might be gathering all the information and as to whether he might be
allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review what has been gathered to
this point. He was informed that all disclosures have to receive proper
Bureau approval and that it would not be possible for him to review such
information in the absence of such approval. He asked if the Bureau could
separate the response by making available immediately portions of the mail
cover lists such as the identities of people who were the targets of mail
covers in the domestic field. He again was informed that this was not
possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallach stated that he
wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list of Bureau mail covers
for the past five years which he had been furnished by a source whom he did
not identify. He was asked (1) if this list concerned the mail covers in the
national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Mr. Wallach stated it
was a national list in the national security areas. He stated he was not sure
of its accuracy. He indicated that he would have no reservations about using
the list to conduct the Senate Select Committee business and stated that inter-
views may be conducted based on the list.

He was advised that the list would contain sensitive information
which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau investigations. He replied that
the names were not classified, and since they were not classified he would
have no problem in using the list. It was explained to Mr. Wallach that
despite the fact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive
since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the
very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in
possession of sensitive information concerning that individual, Mr. Wallach
pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been informed
previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the
material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureau
should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names
are sensitive and which are not. Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two
other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list,

Miss Gandy was interviewed by itaff Members Mark

used by Mr. Hoover since it was most convenient to his private
office. Mr. Mohr stated that Mr. Gitenstein had attempted to draw
a chart of Mr. Hoover's office. Since that chart was a poor one,
Mr. Giteastein asked Mr. Mohr to draw a rough chart of the office,
which Mr. Mohr did. Mr. Mohr recalls that he inadvertently omitted
the supply room from the chart; which room, he said, would have beea
of Little or no significance to the questioners since it contained only
supplies and no files. Mr. Mobr said concerning the back door to
Mr. Hoover's office, that interviewers were informed that persons
visiting Mr. Hoover were not brought through this back door, which
was for Mr. Hoover's use.

Miss Gandy was asked by Staff Members about the use
of the confereuce room, who attended the conferences, and the purpose
of the conferences. She said that Mr, Mohr explained that the Director
at these conferences discussed with FBI officials matters

| volumes, ring binders of interesting cases, and miscellaneous books.

Miss Gandy was asked how many {ile cabinets were in
her office. She answered that she could not be positive but she believed
there were approximately ten or twelve cabinets of five drawers each.
These cabinets were secured with special locks and the key was kept
im a special locked key cabinet.

Miss Gandy was asked for the names of other employees
im Mr. Hoover's office and she provided the names of Miss Edna Holmes,
Mrs. Erma Metcalf, Miss Ruth McCord, Miss Nancy Ana Mooney and
Mr. Ronald E. Thompson.

Miss Gandy was asked if the Office Manager, Miss Holmes,
had files in her office and she answered,"no." She was asked if the Office
Manager's secretary, Miss McCord, had files in her office and she |
answered that Miss MeCord did have those files necessary to her super-
vision of office personnel and maintenance. She also explained the
funetion of the office receptioniat.

U. 8. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

- Migs Gandy was asked whether {files were kept in the
Telephone Room and answered that the only files kept there were
background material necessary to the functioning of that office. She
was asked if a record was kept of telephone calls and visitors to the
Director. She replied that a daily log was maintained, and that these
logs were permanently filed in the main Bureau files.

Miss Gandy was asked if files were kept in the office
of the mail clerk, Miss Mooney. She answered "yea," and described
these files as mainly photograph files and scrapbooks.

Concerning the mail in Mr. Hoover's office, Mr. Mohr
said Mr. Gitenstein raised a question about "Expedite Processing" of
mail, to which Miss Gandy replied that the personal and confidential
mail for Mr. Hoover was handled by Miss Mooney and that she,

Miss Gandy, was not aware of just how this mail was handled. Mr. Mohr
said he explained to the questioners that this mail was received in the
Routing Unit of the Records and Communications Division and was

taken unopened to Miss Mooney, whe opened it. The clerical employee
who brought the mail then logged it and stamped "Expedite Processing"

off the log. Mr. Mobr said

“Expedite Processing” logs were maintained permanently and Mr. Mohr
answered that to his knowledge the logs were not kept after the items
on a particular log had been accounted for.

Mr. Mohr said that Miss Gandy was asked about
procedures regarding Mr. Hoover's commitments and she explained
that each moraing the employees in the Telephone Room prepared a
“commitment card” of Mr. Hoover's commitments for the day and this
eard was placed on Mr. Hoover's desk the first thing in the morning

for his information. Miss Gandy told the questioners that she received
a copy of the commitment card and that these cards were act retained
permanently. Mr. Mohr said that it was explained to the interviewers |
that the Bureau had an instruction that items of a temporary nature |
bio dhrli lavensihndrpnmndianr Abyeubeteten dal asntmrvatmresdh iron d |

that
Mr. Hoover's office made certain the Telephone Room employees were
promptly advised of all Mr. Hoover's commitments as they were made.

Further, concerning the Telephone Room, Mr. Mohr
said the interviewers were informed that calls for Mr. Hoover were
received in the Burean switehboard and were then referred to the
Telephone Room in Mr. Hoover's office. The employees in the Tele-
phone Room connected Mr. Hoover with the calls. Mr. Mohr said
the iaterviewers asked whether the Telephone Room "screened"

Mr. Hoover's calls and that they were informed that the Telephone
Room did not “sereen" them except for “aut" calla.

Miss Gandy said she informed interviewers, in response
to questions, that she did receive calls from persons wishing to speak
with Mr. Hoover and if he was in his office, the calls would be transferred
to his Telephone Room. She said Mr. Gitenstein made a remark about
a special telephone connection between Mr. Hoover and former Attorney
General Robert Kennedy and also remarked that Mr. Hoover and former
Attorney General Jobn Mitchell also had a special telephone connection.
Miss Gandy said she corrected Mr. Gitenstein immediately by informing
him that no special telephone connection existed with any Attorney
General except Attorney General Kennedy.

Concerning the OC files maintained in Mr. Hoover's
office suite, Miss Gandy said she informed the interviewers that these
files were kept in a locked file cabinet and occupied about one and

one half or two file drawers. In answer to questions from the
interviewers, Miss Gandy said she informed them that on the day of
Mr. Hoover's death she spoke with Mr. Clyde Tolson, who was then
Acting Director of the FBI, and with Mr. Mohr and asked to whom

Mr. Toleon instructed that the OC files and all other
Bureau material sech as interesting cases, monographs and manuals
be delivered to Mr. Mark Felt who then was Assistant Director-Deputy
Associate Director of the FBL Miss Gandy said she was exhaustively
questioned by Mr. Epstein as to whether she called Mr. Tolson or he
called her and concerning Mr. Tolson's location at the time.
Miss Gandy said she told Mr. Epstein that at this late date she had
no idea who called whom but Mr. Epstein was assured that she and
Mr, Tolson communicated. She was also asked when Mr. Tolson
arrived at Mr, Hoover's house on the morning of Mr. Hoover's death.
She answered that Mr. Tolson arrived there soon after Mr. Hoover's
body was discovered. Miss Gandy said she asked the interviewers if
they desired more details of that morning and was told that they did not.

Mise Gandy said she told the interviewers that Mr. Tolson's
instructions were carried out. The OC files and the index cards
pertaining to them and the other Bureau material meationed above were
placed in cartons and delivered to Mr. Felt. She was asked who
delivered the cartons to Mr. Felt's office and answered that she
believed that the delivery was handled by messengers or maintenance
personnel, but indicated she was not certain about this.

Miss Gaady said she told the interviewers that as soon
. L. Patriek Gray II was named to head the FBI, Mr. Felt
him to Director's office to afford him an idea of the office
After Mr. Gray indicated a very special interest in the files in
office, the contents of these files were explained to him and he

was invited to view the contents. Mr. Gray did glance through a
drawer and obviously was satisfied that they contained

correspondeace only and was also satisfied that the Bureau material
had been delivered to Mr. Felt.

Miss Gandy said one of the interviewers remarked that
there appeared to be more OC files than had been indicated aad that 2
larger sumber bad been given to Attorney General Levi. She responded
that she would not know whether other files had been added to the group
after they had been delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr- Citenatein, she said,
attempted to show her a pamphlet apperently containing
the Attorney General ‘which doowrited cortare of the five tn question.
Mr. Gitenstein asked her about specific cases im the OC files and she
teld him that after three years she would not presume to try to
remember specifies. Mr. Gitensteia asked if there was a file containing
| reports from the Washington Field Office. She told him that she
| certataly would not remember such a file, if one existed.

Miss Gandy said there was much questioning about the
jadex cards which pertained to the OC files. She told the interviewers
that they were filed in one index file, that cards of a differeat color
were used and that this index file was locked.

Mise Gandy said she told the interviewers that strictly
personal correspondence of Mr. Hoover had been contained in the file
cabinets in her office and that from time to time during the past fifty

Present at questioning - Mark Gitenstein
Mike Epstein
v Martha Talley (morning session only)
John P. Mohr
Helen W. Gandy

The first questions concerned the set-up of the Director's
office suite. Special interest was indicated in the rear
exit of the suite and it was explained that this exit was
used by the Diredtor as it was most convenient to his private
office. Hr. Mohr algo mentioned the kitchen and lavatory,

as the questioners appeared to be completely unfamiliar with
the arrangement of the suite.

xo Next, the conferente room was described and in answer to
“SS questions the use of the conference room was explained - also,
: ¥ information was given re the contents of the bookcases in this
SENG room, ie, miscellaneous books; the Criminal Code volumns;
Bay the ring binders of Interesting Cases.
2 Numerous questioyns were asked:
How often did the Director call conferences of
the officials of the Bureau -
what were the purposesof these conferences ~
v just who attended them -
were they called by the Director - and was this
at set and regular intervals.
Mr. Mohr explained that tle Director from time to time,
as he reviewed matters of policy and like matters that
; came to his attention, made notes which he discussed with
f the officials, giving them his ideas on these matters and
in turn listening to their views. These sessions considered
oxgr all matters re Bureau administration and policy.

Three; The physical set-up of the office of the Executive
Assistant:
I was asked re the number of file cases in my office -
I answered that I could not, at this date, be positive,
“ but I believe there were approximately ten or twelve fiye-
drawer cabinets =
What were the contents of these cabinets and where
were the so-called o.c. files » were the 0.¢. files
contained in combination locked cabinets ~
I. answered that all of the cabinets in my office were
~ secured with special locks and key, and that the key was
kept in a special locked keyscabinet in this office.
Questions-did I receive calls for the Director from
his friends and others, and did I transfer them to
his desk; did I make memoranda of such calls; did I
v- . keep a diary; (Mr. Gitenstein made a remark re a
* * speéial telephone connection between the Director
and "Bobby", apparently thought better of it, and
remarked that Mr. Mitchell had such a connection)

Eg lOSUIY { la 3H ae OF
HW 55029 DocId:32989611 Page 116 (gd a tla OA



! He was immediately corrected by me to the effect
| i that no such comection existed with Attorneys

| General other than Attorney General Kennedy.

I answered that I did receive calls from persons wishing
to speak with the Director; that, if he were in his office,
such calls.would be transferred to the Director's Office
telephone room to be connected with the Director if he
should be in his office and could teke the call. (Here
Mr. Mohr explained in @tail the system of handling tele~
phone calls in the Director's office and the functions of
the FBI telephone switchboard. )

It was explained that the file cabinets in my office
contained strictly personal correspondence of the Director;

« that from time to time during the past fifty years files

which were no longer current were eliminated,

Re the so-called o.c. files-~ it wag explained that these

files were located in one of the locked cabinets; that there

were, possibly one and a half or two file drawers of these.

In answer to questioning it was explained that on the day

of Mr. Hoover's death I spoke with boty.Mr, Tolson, who at

“ that time was Acting Director, and Mr, Mohr, and asked for
instructions as- to whom I should deliver the 6fficial-

<:. Confidential files and other Bureau material contained in

the Director's offices. I also advised Mr. Tolson of

v. Myr. Hoover's expressed instructions that his personal

correspondence be destroyed, and that he, Mr. Hoover, had
begun a review of these personal files sometime previaus to
» his death, and some already had been destroyed. Mr. Tolson
instructed that the official-confidential files and all
other Bureau material, ie, Interesting Cases;. monographs,
Manuels, be delivered to Mr. Mark Felt.(Here, I was asked
» Where the Bureau material was kept and answered that booke
eases in my offbe were used for this purpose.
I was exhaustively questioned by Mr. Epstein as to whether -
I called Mr. Tolson (and where he was. located at the time)
<r, or whether Mr. Tolson called me. I told him that at this
late date I had no idea as to who called whom, but that he
was assured that Mr. Tolson and I communicated. I also was
asked when Mr. Tolson are ved at Mr. Hoover's house on the

| morning in question and/W&s told Mr. Tolson arrived after

Mr. Hoover's body was discovered. (I asked if more details

| ss of that morning were desired and was told no.)

I explatned that instructions were immediately carried out;
the 0.c. files, with the“index cards pertaining to them,
together with the above mentioned Bureau material, was placed

, im cartons and delivered to Mr. Felt. I was asked who carried
these cartins to Mr. Felt's office and said I could not at

this date answer this but I believe they would have been

carried by either messengers or maintenance personnel.

“There was quite much questioning here as to how and where the
index cards were filed. It was explained that they were filed

& an the one index file, cards of a different color being used,
and that this file also was locked.

\ HW 55029 DocId:32989611 Page 117


bk

Four: Questions were asked, in further connection with the
set-up of the office and personnel.

AW 55029 DocId:32989611 Page 118

In connection with the above authorizations it was
explained that as soon as Mr. Gray was named as the

new Director Mr. Felt brought him to the Director's

office to afford him an idea of the office set-up;

that Mr. Gray indicatéd a very special interest in

the files in my office; that. their contents were ex-
plained to him and that he was invited to view the:
contents. He did glance thru a drawer and obviously

was satisfied that they contained personal correspondence
GQnly, and was also satisfied that the Bureau material had
been delivered to Mr. Felt. One of the questioners
remarked that, there appeared to be more o.c. files than
had been indicated; that a larger number had been given
to Attorney General Lewi...I remarked that I would not
know whether other files had been added to the Broup
after they had been delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr. Gitenstein
then attempted tq show me a pamphlet indicating what
appeared tb be testimony of the Attorney General describing
certain of the files in question and asked questions re
specific cases which were contained in the o.c. files. I
told him I would not presume, after three years, to try
to remember specifics. He asked if there were a file
containing reports from the Washington Field Office. 1°:
told him certainly I would not remmamber such a file, if
orie existed.

To questions regarding the destruction of personal
correspondence files I explained that up until the

time I left the Bureau I continued to tear up and de- .
posit the contents of these files in the "confidential
trash" waste baskets; (Mr. Mohr here explained this
method of disposal.) that I had asked Mr. Gray.if, in
order to vacate the office as soon as possible for his
convenience, I could have his approval to send to

Mr. Hoover's house files which could not be disposed of
before my date of retirement and finish the taskthere.

He did not hesitate to give me this permission. (Mr. Felt,
who was present when I spoke with Mr. Gray (in my office)
suggested that a locked room on the fifth floor, with a
key only I would have, could be made available so the files
would be disposed off without moving. ~. ‘ .I said that
would not be necessary and Mr. Gray agreed. At this point
Mr. Gitenstein asked me if I thought I might not be the
only one with a key. I asked him what he would have thought
and he smiled and said he would have thought that.

The office of the Office Manager (Miss Holmes). Did she

have file cases in her office. The answer was "no".

The office of the secretary to the Office Manager (Miss McCord)
Were there files in her office and if so what Sia they contain.
The answer was "yes" and the contents were material necessary

maintainance. 7 if 2

The reception room,

The function of th

> "as
ua" : e .

The telephone room. Here, again, close questioning re
files kept in this office. Assurance was given that
the only files kept here were background material necessary
to the functioning of the office. Questions were asked
if records were made of telephone calls and visitors to
the Director. Information was given that a daily log was
maintained, and it was described. Question was asked re
where and how long the logs were maintained. Answer was
~“ that they were permanently filed in the main Bureau files.
Mail clerk's (Miss Mooney) office. Were there files here?
Answer was yes, mainly photograph files and also the
scrap books.

v The names of Miss Holmes - Mrs. Metcalf - Miss McCord -
Ron Thompson and Miss Mooney were requested and given.

At one point during the sessions in being questioned re the

uw Director's being advised of Bureau matters the questioners were
told by. both Mr. Mohr and me that Mr. Hoover never was out of
touch with the Bureau, day or night, whether in town or out of
town. :

Also, I said at a point when the questioning appeared to be
getting pretty éar afield, if what they were trying to learn
vw was whether there was contained in the 0.c. files anything that
pons be used for political purpose, the answer was NO + that
had never found the need to lie about anything.

5/23/75

RE: MISS GANDY'S QUESTIONING BY SENATE
SELECT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING
FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH INTELLIGENCE-
GATHERING FUNCTIONS

Miss Gandy and I appeared before the staff of the
subcommittee for questioning on May 15, 1975, our appointment
being set for 10:30 a.m. The group consisting of Messrs. Gitenstein,
Epstein and M. S. Talley immediately proceeded to the former
Carroll Arms Apartment building which is now used as an office
building by the U.S. Senate. We were taken to the sixth floor where

we entered an empty office which contained telephone equipment,
some chairs, and a desk.

N

Mr. Gitenstein had apparently drawn up a list of
questions he wished to discuss with Miss Gandy and he referred to
xc this list throughout the questioning period.

E There is attached a rough draft memorandum
consisting of four pages and dated May 15, 1975, which was prepared by
; Miss Gandy concerning her recollection of what transpired during
aN the interview. The interview, incidentally, lasted until
lp.m. when a one-hour break was taken for lunch. The session
reconvened at 2 p.m. and was terminated at 3 p.m.

I am setting forth hereafter in numbered paragraphs
items which I recollect transpired during the interview which
should be helpful in embellishing Miss Gandy's me morandum.

(1) During the early part of the questioning, Mz. -Gitenstein
attempted to draw a chart of Mr. Hoover's office in the Department of
Justice building. He said he had previously visited Mr. Kelley's suite in
the Justice Building. His effort at charting the office was poor at best
and he requested my assistance. A rough chart was drawn showing
Mr. Hoover's personal office on one end and Miss Mooney's office on
the other end. In making up the chart I inadvertently left out the supply
room which, of course, would have been of little or no significance to
the questioners since this room contained supplies only and no files.

e

HW 55029 DocId:32989611 Page 120



(2) Sometime during the interview, Mr. Gitenstein
raised a question about "Expedite Processing" of mail and how it was
handled in Mr. Hoover's office. Miss Gandy pointed out that the
handling of personal and confidential mail for Mr. Hoover was
handled by Miss Mooney and she, Miss Gandy, was :
just how this mail was handled. I explained that a REEL AAA gonticentian
in the Routing Unit of the Records and Communications Division
was taken unopened to Miss Mooney in Mr. Hoover's office where
she opened this mail and the clerical employee who brought the mail
down then logged it in and stamped the mail "Expedite Processing"
on the left-hand edge. Thereafter the clericd employee would take
the log back to the Routing Unit and when the mail was subsequently
returned to the Routing Unit for regular filing purposes the item
would be crossed off the log. Mr. Gitenstein wanted to know
if the "Expedite Processing" logs were maintained permanently and
he was informed that to my knowledge they were not kept after accounting
for the particular items of mail contained on the particular log.

(3) Mr. Epstein qiestioned Miss Gandy at length

concerning her title as "Executive Assistant." He wanted to know when
she acquired this title and she said she could not recall. He wanted
to know whether anyone else at the FBI had occupied this position and
Miss Gandy explained that she was the only employee with the
title of Executive Assistant who had served under Mr. Hoover during
his tenure in office. Mr. Epstein seemed to pay a great deal of

a attention to the title Executive Assistant and I endeavored to explain
to him that the title was a Civil Service Commission title and that
Miss Gandy's position.was set up under the Classification Act administered
by the Civil Service Commission. Although I am not sure what was
behind Mr. Epstein's lengthy questioning about! this matter, I got the
impression he might be trying to find out if Miss Gandy acted for Mr. Hoover
on her own initiative. This is just a guess on my part and I am not sure

‘ what was behind his questioning.

(4) During Miss Gandy's description of the various
offices, she did mention specifically the fact that the interesting case
files were maintained on the shelves in the big conference room in black

~ folders. They asked what the interesting case files consisted of and I
explained this to their satisfaction; namely, that they were writeups of
closed cases which might be of irt erest for various purposes.

NW 55029 DocId:32989611 Page 121



(5) I should mention that Miss Gandy in describing exactly
how Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files were destroyed said
she reviewed each item that she handled to make sure that it was not
related to Bureau official business. She had previously indicated
~~ that Mrs. Erma Metcalf had assisted her in destroying these files
but she did not mention that Mrs. Metcalf endulged in the same type of review and
Miss Gandy was not questioned whether Mrs. Metcalf had made such a
review as she went through the files and helped destroy them.

(6) Both Mr. Gitenstein and Mr. Epstein queried Miss Gandy
at length about the log kept in the Telephone Room of all calls taken by
Mr. Hoover. They also queried her at length concerning a log that was
L kept in the Telephone Room of all visitors to FBI Headquarters who were
seen by Mr. Hoover. Miss Gandy explained that these logs, to her knowledge,
were currently retained in the regular Bureau file room.

(7) Miss Gandy was asked regarding Mr. Hoover's commitments
and she explained that each morning the employees in the Telephone Room
prepared a commitment card of Mr. Hoover's commitments for the day
and this card was placed on Mr. Hoover's desk the first thing in the
morning for his information. Miss Gandy reported that she received a
copy of this commitment card. She was asked whether these commitment
cards were rdained permanently and she replied in the negative. Somewhere
along the line it was explained to the interviewers that the Bureau had an
instruction that all items of a temporary nature, such as ticklers and the

+ - like were to be destroyed after they were 90 days old. Miss Gandy

indicated these commitment cards would have come under this category

for destruction. Miss Gandy was queried at length as to just how the
Telephone Room employees got their information to make up the commitment
card and she explained that all employees in Mr. Hoover's office made
certain the Telephone Room employees were promptly advised of all of

Mr. Hoover's commitments as they were made.

(8) In explaining the telephone set-up in the Department of Justice

building as far as it related to the FBI, the Staff members were informed
that calls for Mr. Hoover were received in the Bu eau's switchboard and
were then referred to the Telephone Room in Mr. Hoover's office and the
employees in the Telephone Room handled the problem of connecting

Le Mr. Hoover with the caller. They wanted to know whether employees in
the Telephone Room screened Mr. Hoover's telephone calls and they were
informed Telephone Room employees did not screen them except for "nut"
calls.

(9) During a rather heated conversation in the afternoon
Y/Y about some of the questioning being done which seemed to be repetitious and

HW 55029 DocId:32989611 Page 122 -3-



irrelevant, Mr. Gitenstein was told by me that I felt it was high time
the questioners quit "beating around the bush" and came to the point by
asking Miss Gandy if she had ever destroyed any official and
confidential files. Mr. Gitenstein replied they had a discrepancy
concerning the O and C files in that a reliable source had reported
that Mr. Mark Felt had five two-drawer cabinets marked "O and C Files”
in his office. Miss Gandy on the other hand told Mr. Gitenstein in
response to a question that she had turned over to Mr. Felt after
Mr. Hoover's death, as she recollected, one and one-half drawersand
possibly two drawers. of O and C files. I explained to Mr. Gitenstein
that Miss Gandy would have no way of knowing what files Mr. Felt had
in his office and if there was a discrepancy the person to resolve the
discrepancy was Mr. Felt who Mr. Gitenstein had told me previously
had been interviewed by him and had been cooperative. I had previously
explained to Mr. Gitenstein in response to qu stions he asked me when I
appeared before the Staff that at the time Mr. William C. Sullivan had
furnished the data of the 17 White House telephone taps to Mr -Mardian in _
the Internal Security Division of the Department that Mr. Hoover had
insti cted that any Assistant Director or Bureau official who had any
files in his office he considered to be confidential and relating to the
Bureau's work were to be immediately transferred to Mr. Felt and
a memorandum prepared concerning exactly what was transferred to
Mr. Felt. I told Mr. Gitenstein I had no idea how many files Mr. Felt
collected as a result of Mr. Hoover's instructions. It is interesting to

“ note that I was not asked at any time whether I Ind turned over any files
to Mr. Felt in connection with Mr. Hoover's instructions.

(10) Miss Gandy was asked whether there were any files.
vi Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence in Mr. Hoover's former hone
at the present time. Miss Gandy replied no. :

(11) At some point during the interview a reference was
made to the confidential trash baskets maintained in the Bure au, to wit,
the trash baskets with the painted rim-/on top. Mr. Epstein wanted to
know if a log was maintained of items placed in the confidential trash
baskets for destruction. I informed him it wuld be ridiculous to think

: that such a log could be maintained and he was advised exactly how
confidential trash is destroyed in the Bureau. He was also informed of
the Bureau files that were scattered over the streets of Southwest Washington
as a result of the Department of Justice engaging in destruction of some of
their files. This reference permitted an immediate termination of any
questions along the lines of the destruction of confidential trash.

~4-

NW 55029 DoclId:32989611 Page 123



(12) Miss Gandy refers to the fact that questions were
raised concerning Mr. Hoover's back door entrance. The questions
concerning this back door were to determine just who used this
back door entrance and its purpose. In addition to explaining it was
immediately adjacent to the elevators at 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue
which Mr. Hoover used to enter and exit the building, they were also

VY advised that this was Mr. Hoover's private and personal entrance and
that persons wishing to see Mr. Hoover were not brought through this
back door.

The foregoing is submitted for information purposes and
as an auxiliary record of Miss Gandy's appearance before the Staff of _
Senate Select Committee on May 15, 1975, accompanied by me,
John P. Mohr.

On 6/9/75, Mr. K, William O'Connor advised me that the Panel.

He advised that the Deputy Attorney General had requested him to

ADDENDUM: INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 6/10/75 (ee

Intelligence Division strongly feels Exhibits A through E should not
be made available. These constitute work papers prepared on an expedite
basis by Special Agents operating under the understanding their effort was
of 2 rough draft nature which would be utilized by a committee of the Justice
Department and FBI for an in-house investigation. The Agents preparing |
the documents never conceived that their effort would be subject to review
outside of the Department and particularly outside the Executive Branch.

By letter dated 4/21/75 to the Attorney General it was pointed
out these exhibits related to the internal deliberations of the Department
and FBI representatives, some of the material in these summaries is
classified and relates to sensitive operations and they should not be revealed,
Also, Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Silberman in testimony before the
Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee (Edwards Committee)
on 42/20/74 indicated as regards these documents, "If we had thought it was
appropriate to release the full discussion we would have done so at the time.
There are a lot of internal working documents which go into the making of a
final report. *

Further, if these documents are released to the SSC, or if the
Coremittee is allowed access to them, we would not then be in a position to
deny access to them by the Edwards Committee or the House Select Committee
on Intelligence (‘Nedzi), Should they be released and come within the public
domain, we could then be in a position of violating individual rights of privacy
and compromising sensitive investigative techniques and Bureau sources,

We feel we should first go through these work papers and excise such items
to avoid any such complication.

Dor INTD recommends Legal Counsel advise Mr. O'Connor we strongly
i object to the release of the above Exhibits to the SSC, However, we
yr recognize our objection may be overruled by the Attorney General; and if so,
L pconged _ | we would request we bave an opportunity to make the excisions noted above
ant, d nae prior to the a turning the Exhibits over to the SSC.

letters of May uw and May 23,

1975, informing the Select Committee of five additional
COINTELPRO-type operations disclosed by the continuing FBI

review of its counterintelligence files.

The Committee ap-

preciates your candor in disclosing the sensitive aspects of

these programs. Pursuant to

its rules, the Committee will

handle this information with the necessary security. —

I have been informed that a member of the Commit-
tee staff has inspécted and taken notes on the 39-page

report of the Petersen committee on COINTELPRO.

I believe

that our security arrangements are more than sufficient to

safeguard the confidentiality of its contents.

The Commit-

tee members themselves as well as the staff would be con-
venienced by its availability in our secure facilities.

I believe that it is vitally important for the Com-
mittee to be provided with Appendices A through E of that

report.

our stringent security arrangements.

These documents will also be handled according to

In addition, Appendices

K and L should be made available for inspection by designated

Committee staff at the Department of Justice.

I understand

that these appendices are not "raw files" of the FEI.

As to O-FBI public statement - no interest.

As: to P (the overall FBI recommendation) , he
would like personal access. :

ce I discussed as an alternative, access to the

initiating documents in the COINTELPRO matters; and
that I would attempt to obtain those as an alternative
solution to his inquiry. He said that he might be
interested in those documents, but they were far less

- important to him than access to A-E. He reiterated
his sensitivity to the question of raw files, and. ‘
indicated a strong inclination to avoid the raw files
question, proceeding by the proposed expanded summaries | ;
route if necessary, with expanded summaries to be pre- '
pared only in the event of specific questions being
raised after staff access to A-E.

He then went on to state that he perceived a
significance in the recommendation and proposals of the
Petersen Report; and that he felt FBI and DOJ policies
might be perceived as at loggerheads, although this was
muted in the prose. He said that he felt sure that, at
an appropriate time, the Committee would wish to explore,

. by AG testimony at SSC, the actions of the DOJ on the
. recommendation reflected in the report. I said that I
understood his interest in that process.

My recommendation is that, in view of ‘the retrench-
ment regarding "raw files", A-E be made available, under
the conditions outlined above; I am furnishing a copy of
this memorandum to Mr. Daly for dissemination to appro-
priate Executives of the Bureau, and to “Mr. Maroney of
the Criminal Division.

I believe a prompt decision as to A-E would be
most helpful.

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland
Re: Senate and House Select Committees
on Intelligence Activities

Referenced memorandum pointed out that Mr. Clarke
ard Mr. Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's
Committee was already following the procedures outlined in
the Memorandum of Understanding, and had completed the
Committee Staff, it would be inappropriate to furnish a copy
of the Memorandum of Understanding to Senator Church. How
would the Senate Select Committee know it is following the
procedures outlined inithe Memorandum of Understanding if
it does not have a copy? Does it have a copy of DCID 1/14
which has been, and possibly still is, classified?

The FBI has now received a request for a total
of 122 investigations from the Senate Select Committee.
This is many more than anticipated with all expenses absorbed
by the FBI in connection with a function of the Legislative
Branch. In addition, 16 requests have been received to
date from the House Select Committee, Also the FBI has been
asked by the Senate Select Committee to conduct additional
investigation concerning Patricia Ann Monaco, already employed
by the Committee, who admits living with Neal Stevens up
to 4-75, and frequenting a lounge known as a hangout for
prostitutes. Neal Stevens has said he engaged "in all forms
of sexual activities" with Monaco. There is also the definite
possibility that we will have to process many of these cases
under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974,

To date notification has been received from the
Director of Central Intelligence (CIA) that a total of 49
employees of the Senate Select Committee have been certified
as meeting requirements of EO 10450 (Security Requirements
for Government Employment) for access to classified information
up to and including Top Secret, Of this number, 17 staff
members have been brief@d on compartmented information and an
additional 5 staff members designated to receive compartmented
information. From the above it is not clear that, as stated
by Mr. Clarke and Mr. Moore, that the Senate Select Committee
"had completed the Committee Staff."

It is noted that CIA refers to EO 10450 but the
| Memorandum of Understanding, as approved by CIA, does not
refer to EO 10450,

Senate Select Committee (SSC) has made several requests of
the Bureau for information and documents relating to the
so-called "Kissinger 17!' This material is being made avail~
able to the Department with the caveats that the Government
has not publicly admitted to 15 of the coverages involved
and that some material contained in the file has been
impounded by court order due to the Halperin (one of 17)
civil suit, The decision as to whether or not the material
prepared in response to the SSC's request is to be turned
over to the Committee was left to the Department. As
mentioned in above memoranda, Mr. O'Connor advised that he
believed it necessary for a representative of his office to
personally review the file in question before a knowledgeable
determination could be made as to what material should be
turned over to the SSC, In anticipation of the Department's
request, Legal Counsel Division inquired of the Department's
Division as to whether the court order of impoundment
woulc. prevent such a review. On 6/20/75, it was ascertained
that USDC Judge John Lewis Smith, who issued the impoundment
order, gave court clearance to make the "Kissinger 17" file
available to the Department for review as indicated above,

The Attorney General

NOTE:

By memorandum from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams
dated 6/3/75 captioned "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities," Legal Counsel Division transmitted an “Eyes Only"
communication, dated 5/30/75, from the Executive Secretary
of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group. In its communication,
the USIB Group requested that recipients furnish Mr. James A.
Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, with
suggestions for administrative or legislative action relative
to United States intelligence programs.

In response to USIB's request on behalf of
Mr. Wilderotter, INTD Supervisors have been canvassed for
suggestions and results obtained incorporated in communication
being attached for Attorney General's approval. Since USIB's
communication was marked "Eyes Only," we have not specifically
referenced this document in our response to Mr. Wilderotter.
We are, however, providing copies of the USIB letter and our
response for the Attorney General's records and for the Office
of the Deputy Attorney General. The latter action would
appear appropriate, since the Department of Justice was
included amohg the recipients of the USIB letter, although
Inspector John B. Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division was
erroneously designated as the Departmental addressee by USIB.

TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE; DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO THE
“HUBTON PLAN, " COINTELPRO, AND
OTHER PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS

COINTELPRO gr, DIFORMTION ¢
HEREIN 15 Be

Reference is made to memorandum from captioned
Committee dated May 14, 1975, and the appendices thereto, which
contained requests for information from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). Item 20, Part I, Appendix C, requested a list
of any Cointelpro-type activities, as defined in the prepared statement
of Attorney General Saxbe before the House Judiciary Committee on
November 20, 1974, which were engaged in by the FBI subsequent to
April 28, 1971, be provided.

ta response to this request, it is noted all Counter-
intelligence Programs (Cointelpros) were discontinued by FBI
Headquarters airtel to Albany, with copies to all field affices, dated
April 28, 1971. Specifically, this communication listed seven Cointelpros.
In addition to the seven mentioned in the April 28, 1971, airtel,
subsequent reviews at FBI Headquarters disclosed five additional
Cointeipros. In this context, it should be noted several of the 12
Cointelpro operations related to FBI activities in the foreign counter-
intelligence field.

FBI Headquarters airtel April 28, 1971, discontinuing
the Cointelpros noted as follows, "In exceptional instances where it is
considered counterintelligence action is warranted, recommendations
should be submitted to the Bureau under the individual case caption to 0
_ which it pertains. These recommendations will be considered on an we
. : .

individual basis,"
1- The Attorney General Pim Rw

’ Documents Pertaining to the "Huston Plan,"
Cointelpro, and Other Practices and Programs

A review of all of our files which have been referred
to as Cointelpro files revealed no Cointelpro-type activity since
April 28, 1971.

tn foreign counterintelligence operations the objectives

their agents in the United States. Among these are double agent
operations, disruption, disinformation, penetrations, recruitments,
Posner loae aged visa denial and, in rare instances when
conditions allow, prosecution. Thus, it can be seen that so-called
"Cointelpro- type" techniques are, pene seating an integral
part of our foreign counterintelligence efforts, whether they were
practiced in individual cases or under the aegis of a formalized progra.
This is a critical distinction to be made between our foreign counter-
Premed operations and operations conducted in the domestic Securit”

In an effort to comply fully with the request to provide
a list of any Cointelpro- type activities engaged in subsequent to April 28,
1971, in addition to the review of Cointelpro files noted above,
of the Intelligence Division were contacted daring the week of June 2- -6,
1975, to determine if any had knowledge of any euch actions.
foreiga counterintelligence operations, the results of this inquiry were
negative.

NOTE:

See letter to the Attorney General, dated 6/23/75, captioned
‘United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities,
prepared by DR:pld.

It is noted in one instance one individual alluded to the
TARPRO disinformation-type operation which has been directed against
the Soviet intelligence service as being of a Cointelpro character. It is
not believed this latter technique constitutes the type of information.sought
by the Committee.

FROM :R,

SUBJECT: FBI INTELLIGENCE LETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT

This memorandum recommends that we extend our dissemination
of the FBI Intelligence Letter (Inlet) to include Vice President Agnew.

Inlet is outgrowth of Director's personal suggestion for a
channel of high-level intelligence directly to the President. It has provided
medium for furnishing President sensitive and top-level data in which he
would have direct interest and has been disseminated only to President and
Attorney General. Since first Inlet issued 11/7/69, we have prepared
86 issues which have summarized 120 individual items of significance
on a wide range of topics, including racial violence, New Left intrigue,
Soviet and communist bloc espionage, and important foreign intelligence
data, Material is presented in a one-page format tailored to the President's

convenience.

Vice President Agnew in recent conversations with the Director
has indicated a keen interest in the information the Bureau has been furnishing
him in recent months regarding domestic and foreign subversion. It is
obvious the Vice President is relying on the Bureau as a key source of
information. In view of Mr. Agnew's vital interest in these matters and
the high position he occupies, it is believed we should at this time include
him in dissemination to Inlet.

ACTION: er Sette

i If the Director approves, the Vice President will be inclided
in future dissemination of this material.

concerning sworn testimony given to the SSC by Mr. Robert R.

Nichols who served as an BA of the FEI from January 6, 7
= until Bie retirement May 12, 1972. This information is as
voluntarily furnished to the FEI by Nichols.

CIRCUMSTANCES PRELUDE TO TESTIMONY

On May 28, 1975, Nichols telephonically advised the
FBI that S8C Staff Member Lester 5B. Seidel had requested,
and Michols agreed, to travel to Washington, D. C., from
Atlanta, Georgia, to be interviewed in the Committee's
offices, Seidel indicated the interview would concern
Martin lather King, Jr., Stanley David Levison, and related
matters. Nichols was unable to advise whether it would be
a staff interview or an appearance for testimony purposes
before an Executive Session of the Committee. fie was not
told by Seidel that bis appearance would be pursuant to a
subpoena. Michols requested that the FBI make available a
representative so that Michols might consult with him during
the interview, if necessary. Nichols was informed that the
presence of a Bureau representative should not be interpreted
as the FBI furnishing counsel but that the representative
would merely assist Nichols in determining whether a specific

which might compromise a source; information which might
divulge a sensitive investigative technique or method;
information which might divulge what had been furnished the
FBI by other Government agencies and/or foreign intelligence
sources; and information which might adversely affect an
ongoing investigation. It was pointed out to Nichols that
if he se desired, he could obtain private counsel, He was
im ited to obtain additional personal briefing on the early
morning of May 30, 1975, before his appearance before the
S8C, froa the Legal Counsel Division and the Intelligence
Division of the TBI

Early on the morning of May 30, 1975, Nichole was
briefed by the FBI, including advice to him that his
employment agreement with the FBI was being waived for the
purposes of the interview by the SSC to the extent that it
pertained to King, Levison and the Southern Christian

adership Conference (SCLC), the organization which had been
headed up by King. Nichols was reminded of the areas of
privilege and, at his request, was accompanied to the &8SC
offices by SA Seymor F. Phillips of the FBI.

At the SSC offices, Nichols and Phillips net
Mr, John Bayly of the office of the Minority Counsel of the
Committee who indicated that the interview would be under
cath. Staff Member Seidel then appeared and inquiry was
made of him by Phillips as to whether the interview would
be under oath, it being noted that it was only then, after
appearing at the SSC offices, that Nichols and Phillips
became aware of the cath aspects of the interview. When
Seidel said that Nichols would be interviewed in an Executive
Session, Phillips asked that he be permitted to confer with
FBI Headquarters as it would require clearance from the

Sach AG clearance was immediately obtained telephonically

Seidel and Mr. John Smith, of the office of Senator Walter D.
Huddleston of the Committee that clearance for the interview
had been obtained from the AG provided the interview was .
within the scope of the aforementioned areas. Phillips
further indicated that if Nichols believed the interview

was outside the scope, he could invoke 16.22, Code of Federal

Sescion to take place in the nearby did Carroll Arms Hotel
while Phillips remained at the 88C offices in the event he was

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

Nichols was questioned as to what type of
investigation concerning King was conducted besides the
use of a technical surveillance. Nichols replied that he
had attempted to initiate action to infiltrate the SCLC
with live informants but that every one of his suggestions
along this line was turned down by FBI Headquarters. Nichols
furnished the reason for these rejections as being that the
FBI did not want to interfere with civil rights organisations
but indicated that the Bureau had never told him this in
the rejections and that it was his own rationale. Nichols
indicated that from time to time spot physical surveillances
would take place in Atlanta to verify contacts between King
and individuals known or suspected of being communists.
During this phase of the interview, Seidel mentioned the nane
of Harry Wachtel and Nichols acknowledged he was one of
King’s contacts. In response to a question as to whether or
not trash or mail covers were used against King, Nichole
responded that they were not.

Inquiry was made as to why so much reliance was
placed by the FBI on technical coverage of King and so little
was done in the way of physical surveillances, Seidel
pointed out that a technical surveillance of an individual
was a greater infringemeat of bis privacy than was a physical
surveillance. Nichols responded that the Bureau did what it
felt was necesasry to get the information it needed. Seidel
then asked Michols how be would personally feel about a
technical surveillance on him, Nichols, MNichols' response
was that he would rather have his phone tapped than to always
be followed around.

Nichols was questioned concerning the authority for
the technical surveillance of King and how Nichols would
learn of such authority. Nichols explained that he would be

called into the office of the Special Agent in Charge and
told that advice from the Bureau had been received that the
technical surveillance was authorized. When inquiry was

made concerning the mechanics of installing the surveillance,
Michols answered that he had nothing to do with this phase.

On questioning, Nichols discussed the monitoring plant

he had set up with a cover company and Nichole gave the general
location of the plant. Michols indicated that he did not know
who actually made the installation and was asked if an

Al Miller was the sound man in’ the office, Nichols
acknowledged that he was and when asked if Nichols had
monitored the surveillance, Michols indicated he had on a
spot is.

Nichols was questioned and furnished information

of a biographical and personal nature. It included such
things as the period of time he was amwigned in Atlanta, the
period of time assigned security work, the King case and
| criminal work, as well as when and why he had beea transferred
from Atlanta to Oklahoma City. Seidel brought up the matter
of Michols' testimony in Houston, Texas, in connection with
an FBI case concerning the heavyweight boxer Cassius Clay. ;
On joning, Nichols acknowledged he had been transferred
to Oklahoma City because of what the Bureau considered his
deficiencies in his testimony in that case. Seidel inquired
as te what actually Michols had done wrong and Michols |
replied that he had received a letter of censure but had thrown |
| it away and cannot now recall the specific deficiencies for
| which he was censured. He only recalled that bis testimony |

was considered not up to Bureau standards, Seidel then asked, |
What are the Bureau standards? Didn't you tell the truth?”
| Michels respended that there was 20 question as to the
truthfulness of his testimony, that he had told the truth. |

Be: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before S8C Executive Session

Nichols was questioned about his contacts with
another retired FBI Agent, Alan Sentinellia, to whom the King
case Was assigued after it had been handled by Nichols.
Nichols was asked if he had discussed his forthcoming
testimony with Sentinella who resides in Atlanta, Nichols
acknowledged that he had had a discussion with Sentinella
but that they had both purposdy avoided any discussion of the
substance of Nichols’ testimony-to-be and the testimony which
Sentinella had already given the SSC, They discussed only
procedural aspects as Nichols wanted to have some idea in
advance as to what might be expected in any trip to Washington
to testify. It waa Nichols’ impression that Seidel thought
that Nichols was holding out some information on this matter.

| On at least three occasions Seidel inquired of

| Nichols as to whether he had discussed his forthcoming
testimony with Charles Harding of Atlanta, a retired FAI
Agent who had also been acquainted witb the King case in 1964.
On each oc@sion, Nichols denied that he had had any discussion
with Harding on this matter.

Michols was questioned as to whether the technical
sarveillance on King was justified and his response was that
it was justified. hen asked why, Nichols stated that there
was considerable evideace of communist influences on King
inasmuch as King was receiving much advice in his work from
Levison and other communists. Seidel asked if they included
Jack O'Dell and Harry Wachtel and Nichols acknowledged that
it did. When Nichols was asked as to whether or not he had
developed any information as to the communist background of
Levison, O'Dell or Wachtel, Nichols responded that he had
not and that the information was developed by others.

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI

chols Before SSC Executive Session

At one point, when Seidel asked about alleged
harassment by the FBI, Nichols told him of FBI investigations
of chureh burnings in South Georgia and that the Bureau
recognized outstanding work by its Agents in this field
and that some of the ‘ts, including Nichols, had received
meritorious awards. Nichols indicated that he had been
commended for hig work generally in civil rights investigations.

When asked about what the FBI was doing in the King
case beeides use of wiret » Michols advised that he had
attended a conference at Headquarters to explore avenues
of investigation that might be pursued in the King case.

The objective was to discuss ways of better determining the
extent of the communist influences on King. Nichols furnished
the names of the tollowing FBI personnel as attending the
conference: Agents Henry Rouse and Nichols from Atlanta;
and from FBI Headquarters, Assistant Director William C.
Sullivan, and Agents Larry Gurley and Fred Baumgardner.

| (Nichols advised that also attending the conference was

a Bureau official, Joseph Sixoo, but that he did not furniah

this name during his testimony as he did not then recall his

| presence at the conference). Nichols told the SSC that he

| could not remember what decisions were made at the conference.

Nichols was questioned concerning a dispute between

King and former FBI Director Hoover which had been aired by
the news media. Michols was asked if the dispute was the
reason for technical coverage of King and Nichols answered
that he was convinced that that was not the reason for the
technical coverage; that such coverage was otherwise fully
justified. Nichols pointed out that the investigation of

was initiated before the dispute although it was his
recollection that the technical coverage started after the
dispute,
