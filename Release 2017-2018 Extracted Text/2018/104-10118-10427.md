Further study did not commend implementation of the Working
Group's recommendation that all TSD research and development be
placed under DD/R. The DD/P made a substantial argument in favor
of leaving all of TSD under his control in order to insure close and
intimate relations with the operating unite, Further, an argument of
almost overwhelming proportions indicated that the DD/R already had
some very major responsibilities without taking on the diverse and
generally unrelated responsibilities of TSD,

Other Research and Development
aera and Mevelopment.

After considerable additional study it was decided to transfer all
ELINT to DD/R, except for the direct command of certain field units
which under all circumstances should be left under the station chiefs.
Research and development in suppoxt of NPIC would fall under DD/R
for thase very advanced items, but not for current production require-
ments.

Coordination

The staff of the Assistant for Coordination has continued to work
on the same basis as formerly and continues to be constituted of
assignees from other agencies. There appears to be progress in

_ achieving closer inter-agency coordination, but whether this is due

to the work of the Coordination Staff or to the DCI's personal interest
in this subject would be hard to determine,

considered of greatest importance.

IV. Elements of DD/R

1. It should be recognized that Deputy Director for
Research is a cover and this‘ office not necessarily confined
to research but should be tai ked with operationed responsibi-
lities. Also most important project under DD/R is OXCART,
therefore DD/R must be restrained from taking on collateral
activities so fast that OXCART will suffer. The DD/R
responsibilities will cover all phases of Agency responsibility
and activity in NRO which may or may not include the actuai
operation of OXCART. It will include intelligence input into
OXCART and CORONA and SAMOS planning, irrespective of
where operations rest.

2. Location of OSI should be resolved. .

3. Interrelationship between DD/R and DD/P to provide
staff support and particularly the Cl production should be
established by directive of Deputy DCI.


4. With respect to paze 23, certain operational reésponaibi.
lities should pss from DO/2 to DD/P upon completion of
research and development; however a study should be made to
determine whether the many fully integrated operational activities
such as OXCART and some fully integrated ELINT operations
should not be permanently under DD/R who {8 to have both
operational and research and development responsibilities,

Considerations of OXCART
ee OR VAG ARS

1. Responsibility for all phases of OXCART are to follow
the direct supervision of Sec/Def and DCI by agreement with the
OD, Charyk as AR/Sec.Def., will be executive head of NRO, DD/R
will be his Deputy and by assignment will be responsible for all
phases of OXCART.

2. Details of operations, as contrasted to R&D, will be
worked out at a later date.

: 3. NSC directive agreed OXCART tasks are responsibility
of Special Group and question of augmentation {s a matter for Special
Group, not CIA, to decide.

ae 4. DD/R should be charged with the xesponsibility of
mobilizing and utilizing all necessary resources of DD/I, DD/P and
DD/S and General Counsel in performance of DD/R's assigned respon-
sibility as Deputy Director NRO and manager of OXCART project.

5. Question of uae of Air Force officers versus civilians
must be decided by higher authority, likewlse the question of operational
responsibility between that of CLA or DD/R or personnel secanded from
the Air Force versus direct Air Force operation must be decided by DCI
and Sec/Def. and the President after careful consideration of all fssues
and problems relating to this matter.

6, Because of imminence of commencement of test
{lights immediate careful attention should be given to all aspects of
the cover story as certain iaformation concerning the plane will
become known when it is observed in FAA (hat othex radar

V. National Indications Center Watch Committee

1. Appointment should be made next week for General
Carter and myself to visit the NIC and the DLA Centers and
observe the Watch Committee operations and make a judgment
as to whether this organization is properly set up and
efficiently operating, and to rosolve differences between
Mr. Coyne and USIB,


2. White House briefings should continue; a substitute
for Mr. Amory should be arranged until a more adequate
arrangement is provided: Daily briefings of Bundy, Clifton
and Taylor and an occasional briefing of the President by
DCI should suffice.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT : Final Report of Working Group on Organization
and Activities

1. Ihave the honor to present herewith the final report of the
working group which you established in January to consult with you and
advise on the organization and activities of the Central Intelligence
Agency, and of its relationship with other agencies in the intelligence
community. This report reflects the views of the working group and is
divided into two parts. The first part deals primarily with the organiza-
tion of the Central Intelligence Agency and reflects the unanimous views
of the working group, The second part contains comments and recom-
mendations on areas dealing with the work of the Central Intelligence
Agency and activities of the intolligence community in which the working
group was either unable to agree or felt that considerably more study
was needed before action was taken,

2. For the record I would note that the working group held its
first session on January 3 and met on 35 different days between that date
and its final session with you on March 28, During its work the group
had approximately 100 briefings, Most of these briefings dealt with the
organization and activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, but also
included a full day spent with the Department of State in addition to several
briefings on State Department activities and ite relations with CIA; approxi-
mately one-half day spent in the Pentagon in addition to other briefings
by the Defense Intelligence Agency; and a full week spent visiting SAC,
NORAD and other activities in the United States. We were briefed by
the head of every major cormponent in the CIA with the excepticn of three
DD/P area divisions whose briefings had to be excluded because of the
pressure of time. However, we feel that having heard from four other
area aivisions the working group hada knowledge of the activities and
problems of these units, In addition to the 100 briefi 3, the working
group had more than ten executive sessions in which it discussed and
debated at great lengih its findings and conclusions. Finally, there were



some 20 mectings with yourself, and with senior Agency officials to
discuss ovr findings and conclusions. These included at least two
sessions with each of the Deputy Directors and with the Assistant
Director for National Estiraates and the Assistant Director for Cur-
rent Intelligence.

3. The attached report does not purport to be complete or ex-
haustive in any respect, but rather it is an aide memoir to recall to
mind our oral discussions and to record some of the reasons and
Philosophy behind our recommendations,

PARTI

This section deals primarily with the organization
of the Central Intelligence Agency and represents

the view of the entire Working Group.


OFFIC AF TES DCI
ee

Organization of LCl'e Mrficé

We reco:nmend that the organization of the DCI's office be’

changed In order to provide more effective support to the DCI, a /

¢
eysternatized control of messages both oral and written, anda
clear delineation of the responsibilities of the assistants to the v-

DCI. In this connection we would urge that a secretariat be
created,- that the head of this secretariat assign individual ree
sponsibilities to each of the personal assistants to the DCI, that J
daily staff meetings be held for a full exchange on the activities

of the staff, and that all personnel in the Agency be advised as

to how to keep the DCI's staff informed Properly of the activities /

of the Agency.

Comptroller

We recommend that the Comptroller's office be brought
out from under the DD/S, report directly to the DCI's office and JS
receive full authority for fotal fiscal control of the Agency.

We recommend that the Comptroller be designated Chair-

man of a Financial Policy and Budget Committee composed of i

the appropriate senior officers of the Agency, We believe that



such a committee should be kept fully and currently informed of
all Agency activities, and in order to be effective should meet

regularly and submit its reports to the DDCI and DCI,

Inspector General

We recommend that the Audit Staff be combined with the

staff of the Inspector General and that the merged staff report to

the DCI’s office.

We believe that the size of the Inspector General Staff

should be increased with qualified professional personnel assigned

from their respective components in order to perform more
frequent {nspections of Agency unite. We urge‘inepections at
least annually of major operations and of field stations.
General Counsel

We recommend that the General Counsel's staff be
removed from the organization of the Deputy Director (Support)
and report directly to the office of the DCI. In sucha position
the General Counsel should reaume the responsibility for the
direction and guidance of the work of the Legislative Counsel,

which is currently the responsibility of the Inspector General,

Cable Secretariat ‘

We have examined the Cable Secretariat which is currently

* located in the office of the DCI and reports to the Executive Officer, _

We believe it should continus to be in the office of the Director under
the careful supervision of the Executive Director, We are con-

cerned that as it now operates Tequirementa for cables have not

been adequately coordinated, and cables have been disseminated

too often on the judgment of junior officers, We believe this needs Ie

careful study.

Contracts oF,
We believe that the Agency is vulnerable on sole-source

contracts for auch activities as TSD and DPD, and that thase gh,

contracts currently in existence should be reviewed and that all ‘ Pan

such future contracts should be passed on by the DCI's office

prior to approval.

Personnel Assignments
We believe that the DDCI and DCI should be the fiual

approving authority for all assignments to positions of Chief a
or Deputy Chief of Offices (DD/P Divisions and Staffs) or of

field stations and bases, both foreign and domestic.



: ‘oi
We believe the DCI's office should also review all assign- K a

ments in the middie management echelon with particular reference

* to insuring the proper language qualifications, operational training

and suitability,

Public Relations

We recommend that the ‘present system of public relations
by the Agency be changed. While we see the necessity for the wt
DCI to have an assistant in his office handling relations with the BS

public media, we belleve that every effort should be made to

minimize the amount of publicity that CIA recéives,

. We strongly recommend that the Present practice of

&

giving background briefings to newspapermen cease and that of
CIA give information to the press only where CIA hae something
which for operational reasons should be released on an unattri-

butable basis, We urge that no public speeches be given by

Agency officials.

Reduction {n Force
We recommend that the DCI and DDCI insure that the
present reduction in force in the Agency include senior officera,

particularly supergrades who are no longer aa effective as they

should be in their assignments.



Handling of Communications Other Than Cables

We note that under Present arrangements communications:
i

other than cables are handled by the Records Integration Division.

Prenat
of DD/P, which is not always fully cognizant of the interests of tn ay
non-DD/P parts of the Agency, Woe recommend that the entire I a
System of handling incoming and outgoing communications be bo
subjected to further study with a view to insuring adequate dis-
6emination of all communications, Particularly in DD/I, DD/R
and DD/S, which may have need for Prompt receipt of such

material,

Executive Director
amiss Sirector

We have not tried to spell out the responsibilities of the

Executive Director, fnasmuch as we believe this to be Primarily |
& matter that should be tailored to the personal Preferences of i tt
the DCI and DDCI and how they wish to operate their office and ‘ Be
the Agency, We urge, however, that special attention be directed :
to the avoidance of a Straight vertical line of commaad; i.e., all ; {

Problems should not have to pass through each of the three officers,

Executive Committee
Se Lommittee
We recommend the creation of an Executive Committee

to be chaired by the DDCI and consist of the four Deputies, the



Comptroller, and the Assistant to the DCI for Coordination and
Intelligence Community Guidance. This Committee, from a
Policy standpoint, would review Proposed major projects and
maintain a continuous review of all major activities and make
Bppropriate recommendations thereon to the DCI, This Com-

maittee would replace the present Project Review Committee.


ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE
DEPUTY DIRECTCR (PLANS!

Office of the DD/P
tect the D/P

We commend the decision of the DD/P to abolish the Position

of the A/DDP/A, and believe that the restoration of tha previous

organization with just the DD/P and COP in the line of command
in the front office will result ina clear delineation of respongibili-

ties and more efficient operations,

The Staffs
We studied at some length the staffs in the DD/P. We con-
sidered a possible merger of the FI, Cl and CA staffs. We also

studied proposals for divesting the staffs of all operational responsi-

bilities. We beliave that while both are desirable objectives, neither

*
are practicable under present circumstances. We therefore urge

that the FI, Cl and CA staff functions be drawn closer together

under the Chief of Operations and that these organizations insofar

as practical act in the classical sense as staffs for the DD/P, We
further believe that the Operational Services Staff, the Central Staff,
and the residual of the Cover and Commercial Staff, after the changes
recommended below are completed, be transferred to the Central

Support Staff which is Proposed,



|
|

/

Merger of Covert Action Staff and International Organizations Division
The DD/P has advised us of his desire to merge the Covert

Action Staff with the International Crganizations Division. While

this is contrary to the trend of divesting staffs of operational duties,

we nevertheless do not observe any major reasons against such a

merger and believe that it should be tried out in accordance with

the DD/P's wishes.”

Central Support Staff
We recommend that the DD/P draw together into a Central

Support Staff control of personnel and other support mattera cur-
“¢
rently decentralized to the divisions and staffs in order to locate

these functions directly under him.

Special Task Force Cperations

We recommend the creation of an organizational entity to

be known as "Special Task Force Operations reporting directly
to the DD/P, which shall be activated and deactivated upon need,
and which shall be the command inechanisim for handling such
projects ag the Cuban operation which demands the creation of an

organization from Agency-wide assets.



RGR

Assistant to DD/P for Paramilitary and Air Sunport Operations

We recommend the creation of an office in the DD/P to be
known as Paramilitary and Air Support Operations, under the
direction of an Assistant DD/P, to develop the capability for covert
paramilitary and air support operations. We suggest that the bulk
of this new organization be located at [ ? 0 3 where it will have
facilities for organization and training. Such a move will also relieve
the burden on the headquarters building. We recommend that the
individual to head this organization be drawn from military service
and be a senior Colonel or a Brigadier General with wartime para-
military experience. Having in mind the total disestablishment of

‘

the DPD in its present form, we recommend that the Air Support

Branch of DPD be transferred to the new Paramilitary Office of DD/P.

Domestic Division : as

We endorse the-proposal to create a Domestic Division. We
strongly urge that the new Domestic Division utilize the Contact
Division of OO, which is to be transferred from the DD/I to the DD/P,
as the nucleus for field work in the United States. We also believe
that this Domestic Division should take over those functions of the
Cover and Commercial Staff presently carried out by the Commercial

Group, plus all those activities of the Cover Division which involve



SECRET

contacts with domestic organizations in the United States such as
business and foundations. This would involve the transfer to this--
Domestic Division of the Air Proprietaries Branch of DPD, and of
the responsibility for the management of CAT from the DD/S, and
of managing Fairways Corporation. In consolidating CAT and Fair-
wats into the Air Preprietaries Branch we wish to draw attention
to the necessity of having ihe right man to head this branch.

We would also urge that a complete review be made of the
Agency's present and future requirements for air proprietaries and
that a statement of the requirements be provided the Air Proprietaries
Branch indicating exactly what may be needed rare parts of the world,
With the création of the Domestic Division we urge that the DD/P
examine. the requirements levied by DD/P components on the Office
of Security for operational support and if possible reassign these
requirements to the Domestic Division in order to relieve the Office ©
of Security for its more important responsibilities in regard to the

security of CLA,

Operational Aids Unit

The DD/P should have a new unit charged with the following

functions:

-10-



a. Residual TSD activities not transferred to DD/R.

b. Preparation of “operational characteristics" for new
or improved equipment desired to be developed by DD/R.

¢. Close contact with DD/R activities involving develop-
ment of items for DD/P.

dad, The condact of rigorous field tests of these itema
before they are released to divisions for operational use.

We recommend that all of the research and development responsi-
bilities currently in TSD be transferred to DD/R. Remaining uaite
in TSD should be transferred to the new DD/P division recommended
above; e.g., Audio Support lesa Research and Dévelopment, Photo-
graphic Support less R & D, Special Assistance, Intelligence,
Personnel, Authentication, and Graphic Arte Reproduction. We
note, however, that DD/P himself would prefer to retain under his
own responsibility the R & D function as it pertains to specific items
to be used by individual agents (audio devices, incendiary items, etc. )
Deputy Chief for British Commonwealth Affairs, Western European ,
Division
We recommend the creation in the Western European

Division of a second Deputy Chief for British Commonwealth Affaira.

‘We suggest that this Deputy Chief have as hie line responsibilities



fpunuanae. ae

all matters involving ( o 4 .
: 2). Further, this officer should
have full control authority over. ‘a
ao
: a
and all other components of the Agency, including the DD/I,should

keep this officer advised on'a daily basis (é 2 a

a |

War Plans
Becauge of the vital importance of war plans to the Agency's

‘
relations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we recommend that the War

Plans Croup receive direct support from the DDCI, even though it

should remain organizationally as a part of the Central Support Staff

of the DD/P. : :

Police Programs

We are convinced that United States Government support to
the police in friendly nations can provide great benefits to the
United States and that some of these benefits will assist CIA in its

work.. The President has recently indicated to AID that he wishes

this program to receive strong support. We believe that CIA should



give it greater support than it has previously received. We recom-
mend that the police group in the CI Staff receive such augmentation

as is necessary, and that Project c 2p ©

J be transferred from the NE Division to the CI Staff.

0
Liaison with Department of State
een re epartment of state

We urge that the DD/P centralize liaison with the Department
of State and maintain careful records of all discussions between the.
Agency Flr State Department officials. We note that nearly every
area division chief has a weekly meeting with his counterpart in the
Department but that under the present system there is no organized
method for keeping the central management of thé DD/P informed

of what takes place at these meetings,

Advice to State on Black Propaganda

We recommend that the DD/P develop procedures which bid
insure that other appropriate agencies of the government (Depaxtment
of State, Defense, White House and USIA) are kept appropriately
Eaeenea of black propaganda activities which otherwise might be
misunderstood and believed to be legitimately the views of a foreign
power. We have in mind our discussions with the Department which
heard expressed concern that ‘the Department was unaware of certain

black propaganda activities relating to Communist China and: conse-

quently was led astray.

CLA Personnel Under State Cover
We recommend that CIA personnel under the Department of
State cover make greater efforts to truly live their cover. We. believe

in this connection that the DCI should receive assurances from the

“ DD/P, after proper study, that CIA allowances for rents, servants

and entertainment are in line with comparable State Department

allowances.

“Legitimate: £ oF ckover

We recommend that the Agency more and more place people
under C or 3 cover by the "legitimate" method of recruiting
individuals, having them [_ oF 4

“normal £ or Jeareer. CIA should obviously keep £

and covertly train them. By this method such individuals will be
under true C of a cover and will not only be unknown to

other intelligence services, but also to their colleagues in E

oF J.

|. : Latin American Cperations

We urge that the Agency give high priority to supporting
the expansion of activities of Latin America, and insure that the
Banal: level of competence is assigned to these important posts.
American Friends of the Middle East

We recommend that the project for support of the organization
known as the American Friends of the Middle East, which is cur-
rently being run by the ne Division, be transferred to the IO Division
inasmuch as it now transcends NE Division area responsibilities and
ae activities in Africa, or, if it is determined that AFME activities

- ve
are not worth the Agency's support, that the project be abolished.

ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE
SPUTY DIRECTOR (INTELLIGENCE) Ve

oe

Office of the DD/I

We have carefully reviewed the organization and activities
of the DD/I's immediate office and believe that with the addition
of a full time deputy he will be able to assert the degree of
influence on the management of the units under him required for
gound operations. At present his three office assistants provide
good staff work in this review, but we did observe that a con-
siderable amount of the intelligence produced in the DD/I area
ia reviewed at no higher a level than office chief, if that.

' We recommend that the DD/I establish in his office a
focal point through which all intelligence, processed or unevaluated,
going to the White House must flow. If for reasons of urgency a
report ig sent to the White House prior to evaluation, we recom-
mend that a special notice to the effect that it is unevaluated be
attached to the report and that an evaluation follow the report at

the earliest possible moment,

Board of National Estimates

The Office of National Estimates should be strengthened by
the addition of one top-level foreign affairs expert to the Board of
Estimates, and if obtainable a top-level scientist and a top-level

economist. We also believe that the Board would benefit by the



addition of an individual experienced in business in the international

field, provided one of sufficient caliber could be found who would

be willing to spend two.or three years on the Board of Estimates.

Control of Estimates
We urge that the DCI utilize the USIB to control the

scheduling and to limit the number of National Estimates,

Office of Operations

We recommend that the Office of Operations be abolished,
that the Contact Division be transferred to DD/P to be the nucleus
of the Domestic Division, i oe

“The DD/I haa advised us that with the transfer of Contact
Division, Office of Operations, to the DD/P, he {s considering
closer integration of the Foreign Documents Division and the
Foreign Broadcast Information Division, These units have a lot
in common: both Process unclassified information, both have
considerable language capability. We believe such an integration
should be considered, On the other hand, the Assistant Director
for Central Reference believes very strongly that the Foreign
Bocuse Division should be assigned to OCR, He advances as
reasons: that the procurement of foreign documents are arranged
by OCR; that the dissemination of the FDD product is handled by

OCR; that OCR through ite relations with the Library of Congreas

and other agencies is in a good position to assist in coordinating
the exploitation of foreign documents. We urge that the DD/I
integrate FDD and FBID into the most compatible area of the

DD/TI organization.

at MIT is currently being handled by the DD/P.. If such support

ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR (SUPPORT)
Security Office
We recommond that the burden on the Security Office for
support of the DD/P be reviewed (see DD/P section). In the
meantime, we believe that a careful look at the Security Office
is necessary to insure that the volume of work it {s carrying
fe not in a way Jeopardizing its primary responsibility of
‘insuring that every‘possible measure ia taken to keep the Agency
“secure,
We recommend that all security clearances be centralized
under the Office of Security; ¢.g., clearances taat are issued
by DPD, OCI, NPIC, and other Agency components, While we
would leave the policy of granting clearances with the appropriate
officials, we believe that the Office of Security should maintain
a centralized index for special clearances and do all of the

proceasing of these clearances.

Audit Staff

We recommend that the Inspection and Audit Staff check

regularly on activities in the

plant which are of vital

concern to the Agency.

DD Support

We recommend that the DD/S be given the responsibility for

-support to all projects under the control of DD/R, providing of

course the necessary security safeguards, and that in the future

no parallel support mechanism be developed in the Agency.

Automatic Data Processing

We believe the Automatic Data Processing Steff can
properly remain under the DD/S inagmuch ar this isa aupport
mechanism, although we strongly recommend that the DD/S
in consultation with other deputies concerned direct this staff
to aggressively pursue the objective of automation in the Agency
in such a way as to insure the ultimate compatability of auto-
matic data processing aystems throughout the intelligence

ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR (RESEARCH)
The Office of the Deputy Director (Research) having already
been created, we now make the following recommendations as to

those units which should be included under this Deputy.

Development Projects Division - Special Projecte Branch

We recommend that the Special Projecta Branch of DPD
plus the necessary supporting elements, including those projects
supporting the Department of Defense in advance reconnaissance

Programs, be placed under DD/R.

Technical Services Division
ee ES vivision

We recommend that all TSD research and development

be placed under DD/R. _ :

Other Research and Development

We recommend that the extent to which research and
development for SIGINT collection equipment, including agents
SIGINT equipment, air-borne collection, etc., should be transferred
to DD/R, be left as a matter for negotiation and agreement between
DD/I and the Director of Communications.

We recommend all research and development in support of

NPIC be transferred to DD/R.

PARTI H

This section contains comments and recommendations on areas
of the work of the Central Intelligence Agency and activities of the
intelligence community in which the working group was either unable
to agree, or felt that considerably more study was needed before
action is taken. These views are presented herewith so that they
may aasist and guide those who ae be asked to pursue these matters

further.



Coordination

We note your intention to abolish the present office of the
Assistant for Coordination and to create inits stead an Assistant
te DCI for Coordination and Intelligence Community Guidance.
With the exception of Mr. Coyne, we are fully in accord. We set
forth below our concept of the principal functions of this Assistant.

a. He should be the DCI's principal advisor on coordina-
tion matters within the community and his personal representative
in dealing on such matters with top officials of the community.

b. When so directed he should represent the DCI in
negotiations and discussions on intelligence mattérs with appropriate
officials of foreign governments.

¢c. He should be responsible for development of Comint
and Elint policy insofar as this is an Agency function.

d, He should keep continually under review the general
extent and direction of the intelligence efforts of the community to
insure that such efforts fully and effectively support national policy,
submitting reports and recommendations to DCI as appropriate.

e. He should correspondingly maintain a continuing
review of activities and efforts of the Agency to insure that they
remain fully and effectively coordinated with the activities and

efforts of other members of the community.



We do not consider it practicable at this time to suggest the

“number or qualificaticns of supporting staff officers for this

Assistant. We feel, however, that he will need a group of such
officers and that they should be of particularly high caliber and
broad experience. The functions we visualize for this office are
highly important for the community and for CIA. They have not
been adequately handled in the past. The Assistant should be given
whatever staff the full development of his role may later require,

Mr. Coyne does not concur in this recommendation. He dis-
agrees with (a) the proposed organizational placement and title of
the recommended office, ‘because this would perpetuate the present
ineffective arrangement of the Coordination Office now in existence
and would not provide the recommended office with the stature required
to Her the DCI in fulfilling his heavy responsibilities throughout
the Intelligence Community; (b) the limitations in the functional
concepts of the office, as outlined ator: Further, he does not con-
cur in this recommendation because it does not distinguish sufficiently
the internal CIA operating functions of the DDCI from the community-
wide functions which the recommended office must perform if the

DCI is to execute effectively his principal mission as assigned in

the President's Directive of January 16, 1962, Mr. Coyne believes



that if the office is established along the lines recommended above,
it will be incapable of effectively assisting the DCl in performing
his principal Presidentially-assigned responsibilities of (a) i

coordinating and effectively guiding the total U. S. foreign intelli-

" gence effort; (b) establishing necessary policies and procedures to

assure adequate coordination of foreign intelligence activities at all
levels; (c) maintaining a continuing review, with the heads of the
Departments and Agencies concerned, of the programs and activities
of all U. S. agencies engaged in foreign intelligence activities; and
(d) assuring efficiency and effectiveness, and avoiding undesirable
duplication in the total foreign intelligence effort. Mr. Coyne will

submit his recommendations on this subject at a later date, "!

Princeton Consultants to ONE

Mr. Coyne recommends thatsthis group be disbanded based on
advice from principal concerned officers of the Agency that the group
nike no contribution to the intelligence estimating effort. The other

members feel that on balance the group should be continued,

National Photographic Interpretation Center

We are concerned about the capability of NPIC to handle what

may be a greatly increased volume of work in coming months. Wea



recommend that as a matter of priority the USIB have this matter
reviewed and insure that any increased flow of raw material does
not result in slowing down the prompt and complete processing'so

urgently required.

Caliber of Personnel
We believe that the DD/I should devote some considerable
effort to improving the caliber of personnel in his offices. Although
we did not make a study in depth, we believe that there is a serious
. problem in this regard in OCI and that stepa should be taken under
the new management of OCI to improve the caliber of supervisory

personnel and thus improve the morale of that office.

Merger of ONE and OCI

We studied at some length the feasibility of merging the Office
of National Estimates with the Office of Current Intelligence. We
found the Office of Current Intelligence eager for a merger, the
Office of National Estimates strongly opposed. The DD/I was inclined
to favor it, but foveuces certain personnel difficulties. We do not
believe that such a merger would be wise unless it wae well esta-

blished that the result would be the creation of better national estimates

and current intelligence dailies and weeklies, The DD/I feels that



he should be given at least sixty days to explore this peopeeal and
to prepare his recommendations. We concur.

Mr. Coyne does not agree with the above paragraph and in lieu
thereof recommends that the ONE and OCI be merged now, He

believes that such merger will result in improved intelligence

Products to support the national policy makers. /

Preparation and Dissemination of Memoranda

We have noted considerable unhappiness in the Department of
State because ONE and OCI have established the practice of distri-
buting throughout the community, and to the White House, uncoordinated
memoranda on intelligence matters. These memoranda are prepared
as "think pieces", but the Department of State feels that they often
seem to influence policy at high levels, We think the Department
of State has a point, and we urge‘that such memoranda be carefully
restricted to circulation within the Agency unless or until they have
been coordinated across-the-board.

‘We also urge that the DCI adopt the practice of asking other
agenciea to prepare such memoranda if the subjects fall within the
purview of their responsibilities; e.g., the Department of State on
strictly political matters, We believe that, at a minimum, when

CIA is asked for a memorandum that inquiries should be made of


other departments to determine whether such a memorandum hasn't

already been prepared or might be in the process of preparation,

White House Relations

We are concerned about Agency relationships with the White
House insofar as handling of intelligence matters is concerned. We
would like the opportunity to discuss this with you orally before

framing recommendations.

Research on International Communism

We are concerned about the reported inadequacy of research
done on International Communism, At the present time some is
done in the DD/I area in both OCI and ONE, some is done in the DD/P
area in the International Communism Division of the Counter Intelli-
gence Staff, and some is done in _ State Department in the Special
Studies Group of INR. The DD/I expressed himself as believing
this was sufficiently covered. The Chief, Cl Staff believes it is
insufficiently covered. Representatives of the Department of State
urged that greater expertise be brought to bear on the aubject.
Inasmuch as it will fall squarely on the shoulders of the DCI if not
enough is being done, we urge that the matter be reviewed by the DCI
at an early date to satisfy himself that all necessary research in this

field is being accomplished,

~28~-


Office of Scientific Intelligence
On the new chart we have shown OSI as a division under DD/R

since we understand this to be'your desire, We feel, however, that
OSI in its major activities is more closely linked to DD/I than to

DD/R and therefore more properly belongs under DD/I. DD/I himself

‘strongly supports this view and urges that he retain OSI. We believe

that if this is approved, scientists in OSI should be members of DD/R's
career service, subject to transfer between OSI and units of DD/R as

might be agreed between the deputy directors concerned,

DD/R's Operational Responsibilities

We have some concern relative to your intention to have DD/R
carry into the operational phase his responsibility for certain major
projects involving complex and coordinated operations which are
highly sensitive and where a mis;step could have serious national
or international repercussions. DD/R's key people will be mostly
scientists, technological experts or leaders in specialized develop-
ment fields. Such individuals on the average have no professional
intelligence operating experience and little background or interest
in detailed operational problems requiring thorough inter-agency

coordination, painstaking and tedious follow-up actions and careful

attention to security details, DD/P, onthe other hand, hae a number



of top-flight people who for some years have dealt almost exclusively
with just such problems.

: We recognize all the difficulty, in the course of a project of this
type, of shifting responsibility from one deputy to the other; and we
realize that development must also lap over into the operational

phase. We suggest having as a general rule (but granting that excep=

tions will arise} that when operation begins the responsibility for the

operations should be the DD/P's, but that DD/R should retain his

responsibility for seeing that the equipment he has developed continues

to function properly. There is here attached a specially classified

annex, ve



L.
ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
National Indications Center - ‘Yatch Committee
We have examined quite carefully the National Indications
Center, its organization, its capacity to support fully the Watch
Committee, and its relations with other departments and agencies.
We note that opinions within the community concerning NIC and its
functions vary widely -- from the feeling that it should be abolished,
or combined with DIA indications center -= to the belief that it is
entirely satisfactory in its present situation. We do not fully sub.
scribe to either of these views. i
The functions of the Watch Committee, and NIC, with their

terms of reference, were developed prior to the time when DIA was

: created, Now DIA has developedsa strong capability to provide both

early warning and indications of approaching crises to the community.
Its capacity in this regard will develop even further in the months
ahead,

We are aware that USIB is now considering the Fitch Committee
Report. But we doubt that few if any members of that Committee
were intimately aware of the full capacity of DIA and of its future
plans. We note that General Carroll was reluctant to be drawn into

the Committee's deliberations,

~3l-.

coef


We recommend, therefore, that except as noted below, NIC
operations be allowed to continue as they are for the next three or
four months, At that time we recommenda thorough review of the
Watch Committee and NIC operations, particularly in the light of
DIA's capabilities and activities, with a view to redefining the
xeaponsibilities and functions of NIC as may then appear desirable.

Mr. Coyne disagrees and recommends that the NIC be abolished
now, and that the DIA be assigned the national-strategic warning
fanction and that its personnel complement be enlarged to include
representation from appropriate members of USIB. Mr. Coyne
points to reasons outlined in his memorandum to the DCI dated
February 5, 1962.

We do believe that the National Indications Center should be
properly manned and should receive both the high caliber of pere-
sonnel at the proper grade and the number of personnel to perform
its function promptly and efficiently. In this connection the Depart-
ment of State has no representatives at NIC at present and the DCI
should ask the Secretary to remedy this situation immediately.

We would suggest a change in the present method of preparing
the Watch Committee report. If NIC is adequately manned, we see

no reason why it should not draft, 24 hours in advance, the weekly

-32-


Watch Committee report, circulate it to all agencies for considera-
tion prior to discussion at the Watch Committee meeting when it
could be decided upon in final form and reproduced and disseminated.
Related to the Watch Committee -~ but also an important aapect
of all coordinated intelligence community reports -- we believe that
substantive disagreements should be encouraged and even spelled
out in Watch Committee reports; that NIEs and SNIEs rather than
being suppressed or covered by watered down language as is some-
times the case today, in all cases should reflect the consensus of
views of the intelligence community. If there are differing minority
views on the part of one or more agencies, including CIA, these

i should be spelled out in appropriate footnotes.

CIA Relations with the Department of State
<-

We examined the relations of CLA with the Department of State.
Several matters of concern in this area are mentioned in the section
on the DD/P, We would note that "covering" for the Agency poses
eee problema for the Department in its relations with the Congress.
These include such items that attract Congressional interest as:

the number of officers in each Embassy, particularly the political

section; the designation of CIA officers aal 3 the CIA role in



handling State communications, etc. In these areas we recommend
closeé liaison be maintained with State on Congressional matters and
that whenever possible State be given a helping hand with the appro-
priate Congressional committees on these matters,
We are particularly concerned that the c 2 4 2 designa-

2¢

tions of CIA personnel c J, particularly (79, are so

revealing. We recommend that the Agency arrange with State to
= - ¢ 2 4 a designations.

The Department of State indicated concern about the level in
CIA on which Comint policy matters are handled, and also. noted that
on occasions there appears to be lack of coordination within CIA on
Comint policy matters. This factor is one. of the reasons why we

recommend raising the level of Sigint policy matters to the Assistant

_to the DCI for Coordination and Intelligence Community Guidance.

State's Counter Communiem Office
a  mamuniem Uitice

We reviewed with some interest the proposed creation in the
office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs of the
Department of State of a strategy group for combatting communism.
While the full scope of its function is as yet unclear, we believe that
CIA should follow the developments in this office closely as its

activities will have considerable bearing on the work of the Agency.

- 34.



State's Operational Center

We reviewed with some interest the embryonic operational
center which the Department of State is developing. We found that
this is an interesting development and would obviously have bearing

on the intelligence community,

State at White House Briefings

We recommend that in accordance with the present practice of
@ representative of the Defense Intelligence Agency attending the
briefings of the White House staff by CIA, that a representative of

the Department of State also be invited to attend these meetings,

Receipt of Top Classification Messages

We recommend that the DCI take up directly with the President

the preblem of receiving all pertinent mess4ges dealing with foreign
; .

affairs which might have any bearing on intelligence estimates or
reports, or on covert operations, We have particularly in mind
such communications as between the President and Khrushchev, etc.
We believe that it is important for the DCI to see such messages in
order to give proper guidance to the intelligence and operational

activities of the Agency,

other departments where appropriate, of any black Propaganda activi-
ties that might be misinterpreted by the U.S. Government if they were
presumed to be legitimately the statement of another government. |

CIA Personnel Under State Cover
cet ener State Cover
The DD/P is making a thorough review of State cover directed

toward insuring that CIA personnel are not out of line in their various
allowances with their State Department colleagues.



Assistant to DD/P for Paramilitary and Air Support Operations

We recommend the creation of an office in the DD/P to be
known as Paramilitary and Air Support Operations, under the
direction of an Assistant DD/P, to develop the capability for covert
paramilitary and air support operations. We suggest that the bulk

of this new organization be located af Where it will have

facilities for organization and training. Such a move will also relieve
the burden on the headquarters building, We recommend that the
individual to head this organization be drawn from military service
and be a senior Colonel or a Brigadier General with wartime paras
military experience. Having in mind the total disestablishment of
the DPD in its present form, we recommend that the Air Support

Branch of DPD be transferred to the new Paramilitary Office of DD/P.

Domestic Division a.
—e sion

We endorse the proposal to create a Domestic Division. We

' strongly urge that the new Domestic Division utilize the Contact

Division of OO, which is to be transferred from the DD/I to the DD/P,
as the nucleus for field work in the United States. We also believe
that this Domestic Division should take over those functions of the
Cover and Commercial Staff presently carried out by the Commercial

Group, plus all those activities of the Cover Division which involve



| : all matters involving :

{ : : Further, this officer should

coat

have full control authority over

and all other components of the Agency, including the DD/I,should

keep this officer advised on a daily basis i

War Plans

Becauge of the vital importance of war plans to the Agency's
relations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we recommend that the War
Plans Group receive direct support from the DDCI, even though it

should remain organizationally as a part of the Central Support Staff

of the DD/P, .

Seeeeeceeaeeeeevceectesees

Police Programs
We are convinced that United States Government support to

the police in friendly nations can provide great benefits to the
United States and that some of these benefits will assist CIA in its
work. The President has recently indicated to AID that he wishes

this program to receive strong support. We believe that CIA should


wot tied

give it greater support than it has previously received. We recom-

mend that the police group in the CI Staff receive such augmentation

as is necessary, and that Project

be transferred from the NE Division to the CI Staff.

Liaison with Department of State

We urge that the DD/P centralize liaison with the Department
of State and maintain careful records of all discussions between the
Agency and State Department officials. We note that nearly every
area division chief has a weekly meeting with his counterpart in the
Department but that under the present system there is no organized
method for keeping the central management of thé DD/P informed

of what takes place at these meetings.

Advice to State on Black Propaganda

«

We recommend that the DD/P develop procedures which will
insure that other appropriate agencies of the government (Department
of State, Defense, White House and USIA) are kept appropriately
informed of black propaganda activities which otherwise might be
misunderstood and believed to be legitimately the views of a foreign
power. We have in mind our discussions with the Department which
heard expressed concern that ‘the Department was unaware of certain

black propaganda activities relating to Communist China and conse-

quently was led astray,

CIA Personnel Under State Cover
We recommend that CIA personnel under the Department of
State cover make greater efforts to truly live their cover. We. believe
in this connection that the DCI should receive assurances from the
: DD/P, after proper study, that CIA allowances for rents, servants
and entertainment.are in line with comparable State Department

allowances.

We recommend that the Agency more and more place people

under jcover by the "legitimate"' method of recruiting

individuals, having them|

‘normal : career, CIA should obviously keep the 7

dvised concerning these individuals, work with the /
