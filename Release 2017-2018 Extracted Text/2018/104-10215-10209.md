of the people present,

and this was obviously of a passive nature.

knew all those present (about four in number, the rest of the work force

being on vacation) and assured us that they were all trusted employees.

Should they ask any questions, which Subject felt was unlikely except

thra possibly noimal business curiosity, he would say that we were

just a customer interested in pricing jewelry.

•5. Items of interest.

A. AMLASH. Subject discussed at length

talking to AMLASH, and about his general mental attitude today. The

"complexes" of AMLASH, referred to in other previous correspondence,

included guilt feelings about people he has killed in Havana and the

necessity and validity of the act,and resolution of the problem of his

wife, who, although they are separated, is still well-liked by AMLASH.

It seems, married her out of obligation, and although he doesn't

love her in the husband-wife sense, he adnires her and is concerned

for her welfare and happiness.

The problems of the Cuban scene today

also are pressing upon AMLASH, 1.e., the sell-out of the revolution by

Castro and the plight of the people. To interest AMIASH in defection,

it will probably be necessary to agree to attempt to get the wife, child

(2 year old female) and the mother out of Cuba.

• Commo Channel with AM.AS

When necessary to communicate

curely with AMLASH, Subject has contact in Italian Embassy who tak

Letter into Cuba, gives personally to a cousin of Subject,

gives it personally to AMLASH. In this manner several months ago, Subject

stated he told AMIASH to try again to come out this sunner (62) and they .

could meet in Europe for talks.

In reply, AMIASH sentepost card post

The postcard was nailed in an envelope.

message said that ANTASH hoped things didn't go as last jear (no meeting)

and that he would expect to Subject in Paris during the last half of

This postcard and envelope are attached herewith.

C. Other Leads for Dissadents and Potential Defectors/Agents.

I.) Montreal. Roberto Echevarria. Secretary in

Cuban Ottawa Mission (Economic). InTorred Subject during his recent trip

to Montreal that 6 new members had been assigned to the Cuban Economic

Mission Phone 738-8883) but not sure of functions or actual office in

which they working. (Trace phone number for answer.) Echevarria,

according to Subject, can probably be had. First, however, we must

squash an old (1958) NYC police charge of stealing an auto.

used by Echevarria and an accomplice to take another Cuban for a ride

because he had taken money from Echevarria's group for guns in the fight

against Batista, and

then had not delivered.

The victim was not hurt,

according to subject, as he escaped fron the flat where he was held when

the guards were asleep. If this charge is squashed, and Echevarria can

get eventual assylum here, this would be big incentive for him vis-a-

vis recruitment in place or defection according to Subject.

2.) Jose REVEILLON, might be possible to get in

the future, says Subject.
