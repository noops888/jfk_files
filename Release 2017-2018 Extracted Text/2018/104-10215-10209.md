against AMLASH. He objected to an offer to meet his expenses in full

of the people present, and this was obviously of a passive nature.

None approached the office where the discussions were held. Subject
knew all those present (about four in number, the rest of the work force
being on vacation) and assured us that they were all trusted employees.
Should they ask any questions, which Subject felt was unlikely except
thru possibly no:mal business curiosity, he would say that we were

just a customer interested in pricing jewelry.

5. Items of interest.
SS SE ores

A. AMLASH. Subject discussed at length the problens of
talking to AMLASH, and about his general mental attitude today. The
Teomplexes” of AMLASH, referred to in other previous correspondence,
included guilt feelings about people he has killed in Havana and the
necessity and validity of the act,and resolution of the problem of his
wife, who, although they are separated, is still well-liked by AMLASH.
AMLASH, it seems, married her out of obligation, and although he doesn't
love her in the husband-wife sense, he admires her and is concerned

for her welfare and happiness. The problems of the Cuban scene today
also are pressing upon AMLASH, i.e., the sell-out of the revolution by
Castro and the plight of the people. To interest AMLASH in defection,
4t will probably be necessary to agree to attempt to get the wife, child
(2 year old female) and the mother out of Cuba.

B. Commo Channel with AMLASH. When necessary to commmnicate
securely with AMLASH, Dubject has contact in Italian Embassy who takes
letter into Cuba, gives personally to a cousin of Subject, who in turn
gives it personally to AMLASH. In this manner several months ago, Subject
stated he told AMLASH to try again to come out this summer (62) and they
could meet in Europe for talks. In reply, AMLASH sentfpost card post-
marked Vienna 26 June. The postcard was mailed in an envelope. The
message sald that AMLASH hoped things didn't go as last year (no meeting)
and that he would expect to Subject in Paris during the last half of
August. This postcard and envelope are attached herewith.

C. Other Leads for Dissadents and Potential Defectors/Agents

“I.) Montreal, oserto Wehovarria. Seoretary in
Cuban Ottava Mission (Kec

nome). —InTorne ject during his recent trip
to Montreal that 6 new members had been assigned to the Guban Economie

which they working. (Trace phone mumber for answer.) Echevarria,
according to Subject, can probably be had. First, however, we must
Squash an old (1958) NYC police charge of stealing an auto. ‘This was
used by Echevarria and an accomplice to take another Cuban for a ride
because he had taken money from Echevarria's group for guns in the fight
against Batista, and then had not delivered. The victim was not hurt,
according to Subject, as he escaped from the flat. where he was hela when
the guards were asleep. If this charge is squashed, and Echevarria ean
get eventual assylum here, this would be big incentive for him vis
vis recruitment in place or defection according to Subject.

2.) Jose REVEILLON, might be possible to get in
the future, says Subject
