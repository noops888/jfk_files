SUBJECT: Funding of AMIRON and AMBUD Organizalions

1.

With the launching of the AMBUD organizalion we are faced

with the Immediate need of re-appraising our funding relationship

with AMIRON. Il one cuneidera that AMBUD is, for all practical

purpoes, an outgrowth of AMIRON, it would appear completely

logical to expect AMBUD to take over certain functions which were

previously the responsibility of AMIRONas vur chosen Instrument.

For all practical purposes, AMIRON has served its purpose and.

now that we have AMBUD, no longer noeda lo exiat.

2. When AMBUD-l returned from his visit to the camps, Peter

N. LICARI informed him of the urgent need for deciding what functione

of the AMIRON organization he wanted to take over. To date, we have

had no word from AMBUD-1 on this subject.

3. Since we will probably not be successful in gotting the deaired

information from AMBUD -1 within the next few days it is believed

that the following would be the most practical approach to the problem

of interim financing of the AMBUD organization and the gradual cur-

tallment of funda for AMIRON.

A. That LICARI inform AMBUD- 1 that the sum of $15, 000

is being deposited to a separate account to be managed by

AMTIKI-I separate from regular AMIRON funds. Thie fund

can be utilized by AMBUD-1 for:

(1) Salaries of a small public relations staff;

(2) Salaries of a small planning stall;

(3) Travel and related expenses of AMBUD membere;

(4) Any miscellaneous expenses deemed necessary by

AMBUD-1.

thought to his budgetary. and porsonnel needs but should not

two woeke under present arrangements.
