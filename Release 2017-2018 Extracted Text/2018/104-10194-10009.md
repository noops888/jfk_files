-1., Latin American Consultant =

area Knowledge and spanish language fluency dates back to
1946-49 when I engaged in preparation of ec:nomic and political
studies and analyses of Latin American republics for U.S. Air Force
staf? and command dissemination. After studies in Scononic and Social
Sciences at universities of Costa Rica and Havana, I contributed to,
or supervised, research, analysis and preparation of investment and
marketing studies in Mexico-and Cuba. Because of languase fluency
I have frequently maintained business and social contacts with xhe
government agencies and ind nous organizations.

2. Training, Administrtion anc

At various times, I have supervised two to five company personnel
and up to twenty or, tuirty, indégenous field axents. This also involved
2 eee nad esmlegaaene and training of indigenous personnel as well.
as funding their field survey operations. Training usually xax included
the techniques: of- interviewing as attuned withthe field of study or
survey. Id Phe comoilation of studies and publications frequently
required cditoriai supervision and using skills
in maps, photography, reproduction
