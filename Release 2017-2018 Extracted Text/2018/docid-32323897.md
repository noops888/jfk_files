among the Italiam element and it will be very fnlikely
that the FBE would find anyone who would have anything
to say concerning CIVELLO. He pointed out CIVELLO.
apparentiy has untold resources and that he is most
anxious and willing to underwrite any anterprise so
long as he can be assured of a ten percent profit on
his investment. CIVELLO reportedly complains that he
is hurting financially because the trial concerning the
Apalachin meeting cost him between $35,000 and $50,000.

““Dagos" in Dallas and he is highly respected and regarded _

be used % bac. up against the wall force cooperation.

PCI stated FRANK TORTORIELLG bears considerable
watching as he appears to be loaded with money, is very
elese te JOR CIVELLO snd mekes frequent and numerous trips
to Chicago (probably runner). PCE has stated that CIVELLO
has been backing the Pedigo’s Drive-In Grocery, approximately
6 to 7 throughout Dallas. He is presently financing the
construction of & big Pedigo lrive-In Grocery at the inter=
section of Fitzhugh and ‘Cole.

PCY stated that approximately 3 or 4 months ago he
was looking for a drive-in grocery himself and had made
prelimiasry negotiations with the Metager Dairy people to
assist in a financing of 4 new location. While he was
negotiating for this new location he was contacted by JOE
CIVELLO whom he knew of previously, but did not know personally.
CIVELLO told him that he had heard that he was interested in
going into.the drive-in grecery business and that he should
deal with CIVELLO as CIVELLO could finance everything and
anything he needed. As a result of this contact with CIVELLO
the met CIVELLO at CIVELLO’s instructions exch day at approxi-
mately 9 AM at the “pump” (Gulf Station on Ross) and they
would ride around town locking for new locations. This went
on for approximately 14 weeks. PCI stated that a decision
was made for him to open up # drive-in grocery at the inter-
section of Inwood and Lemmon Avenue. CIVELLO would put up
$90,000 to lease the property and PCI would have to pay
$400 @ month rent. for the property over a 5 year period
with a 5 year option for renewal, PCI stated that CIVELLO
is extremely cagey and nou-committal and when he came to draw
up the contract PCI was concerned as CIVELLO‘s name did not
appear anywhere in the transaction. He inquired of CIVELLO

- #8 to where he would stand if the thing fell through and

CIVELLO told him that he would have no worry that he, CIVELLO,
would take care of everything for him. PCI stated that ~
CIVELLO wants a minimum of 10% profit from all investments of
this type he undertakes. Before the contract was fully

7 negotiated there was some difficulty in the actual obtaining

* of the property, therefore, PCI was able to get out of -
the agreement. He was having considerable trouble by his
wife's pressure being brought on him not to negotiate with
CIVELLO and this was @ graceful way for him not to deal with
CIVELLO. PCI stated that “who operates the
Ross Drive-In on Lemmon, was completely financed by CIVELLO.
