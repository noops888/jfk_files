SUMMARY

Re Dallas airtel 5/8/61.

Re: JOSEPH FRANCIS CIVELLO, aka.

AB (DI. 92-36; DL 162-1)

On 5/14/61, ASAC DAVID W. BREEN talked with

PCI JOHN MICHAEL GRIZZAFFI and he related the following:

He pointed out that JOE CIVELLO is one of the smartest

"Dagos" in Dallas and he is highly respected and regarded

among the Italian element and it will be very anlikely

that the FBI would find anyone who would have anything

to say concerning CIVELLO. He pointed out CIVELLO.

apparently has untold resources and that he is most

anxious and willing to underwrite any enterprise so

long as he can be assured of &

• ten percent profit on

his investment.

CIVELLO reportedly complains that he

is hurting financially because the trial concerning the

Apalachin meeting cost him between $35, 000 and $50,000.

who talks too nuch at times and who could

be used ty backst up agalost the wall to force cooperation.

Pc. stated

FRANK TORTORIELLO bears considerable

watching

as he appears to be loaded with money, is very

ClOSe tO JOE CIVELLO

and nakes

frequent and numerous trips

to Chicago (probably runner).

PCI has

stated that CIVELLO

has been backing the

Pedigo's Drive-In Grocery, approximately

6 to 7 throughout Dallas.

He is

presently financing the

construction of a big pedigo Mrive-In Grocery at the inter

section of Fitzhugh and

PCI stated

that approximately & 0r 4

months ago he

looking for a drive-in grocery hinself and had made

prelimiday

negotiationg with the Metager Dairy people to

assist in a financing of & new location. While he was

negotiating for this

new location he was contacted by JOE

CIVELLO whon he knew of previously, but did not know personally.

CIVELLO told him that he had heard

that he was interested in

going into the drive-in grocery business and that he should

deal with CIVELLO AS CIVELLO could finance everything and

any tring he

needed.

As a result of this contact with CIVELLO

he net CIVELLO at CIVELLO's instructions each day at approxi-

mately 9 AM at the "pump"

(Gulf Station on Ross) and they

would ride around town looking for new locations.

This went

on for approximately l, weeks.

PCI stated that a

decision

was made for him

to open up & drive-in grocery at the inter.

section of Inwood and Lennon Avenue.

CIVELLO would put up

$90,000 to lease

the property and PCI would have to pay

$400 & month rent. for

the property over & 5 yeaz

period

with a 5 year option for renewal.

PCI stated that CIVELLO

is extrenely cagey and non-cornital and when he came to draw

up the contract PCI was concerned as CIVELLO's name did not

appear anywhere in the transaction. He inquired of CIVELLO

to where he would stand if the thing fell through and

CIVELLO told him that he would have no

worry that he, CIVELLO,

would take care of everything for him.

PCI stated that

CIVELLO wants a minimun of 10% profit fron all investments of

this type he undertakes.

Before the contract was fully

negotiated there was some difficulty in the actual obtaining

of the property,

therefore, PCI was able to get out of

the agreement.

He was having considerable trouble by his

wife's pressure being brought on hin not to negotiate with

CIVELLO and this was & graceful way for himnot to deal with

CIVELLO.

PCI stated that PalE MERRay, who operates the

Ross Drive-In on

Lemmon, was

completely financed by civilio.
