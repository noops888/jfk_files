Querido Amigo:
Paso a contestar tu atenta nota de fecha 2

del actual.- Rapidamente, trataré de darte un panorama de !o que

ocurre aqu{ y de algunas ideas para Ja FLAT.- Para mejor informa-

cidn tuya, te acompatio ademfs un informe sobre la situacida inter- a

na de la CGT Argentina y algunos problemas que nos afectan muy agu-

damente a los trabajadores de esta parte de Latinoamerica,-

l= La huelga general de los obreros del puerto
lieva ya al dfa de la fecha - 53 dfas de duracién.- A pesar dé la
solidaridad que han recibido de muchos gremios y de todas las fuer=
zas populares, la situacidn de estos compaieros es muy dura,~ Los
motivos de la huelga los encontrards en e] informe adjunto,-

La ITF ha “recomendado" el boycott interna~
cional en apoyo de los portuarios argentinos.- La medida es justa,
pero ha resultado bastante limitada ya que no todos los sindicatos
adheridos a la ITF lo han puesto en prf&ctica, ademés en-algunes lu-
gares se aplicé mal, pues se boycoteaba a los barcos argentinos, pero
no a los de otros banderas que venfan con mercaderfas de Argentina;
esto uo es eficaz y se presta a maniobras turbias.- YO ESCRIBB A LA
CLASC y a la CISC pidiendo un apoyo decidido a los portuarios argen-
tinos, pero aun no hemos recibido aqu{ la documentacién sobre. las me-
didas que hayan adoptada nuestras centralgs internacionales,~

2.- Otro conflicto sumamente grave, es el que
enfr@ntamos en este momento los ferreviarios.- El gobierno ha sancio-
nado por ley un nuevo reglamento de trabajo que nos retrotrpe a 50
ailos atrés en muchos aspectos; adem#s el plan oficial prevé Ja redu@
cidn de los 25 talleras eon 51 lineas de produccidn que existen, a
solamente 19 talleros con 31 1fneas de produccion, Esto significa
RESOQUPACION y ademas, perjudica al sistema ferrevigrio y al pafs.-

. a
Es necesario preséonar a la Federacién In~
ternacional de Sindicatos Cristianos del Transporte de la CISC, y a,
las organizaciones do base de la FLAT, para que se prenuncien tambien
en este grave conflicto, crucial para cl movimiento obrero argentino,
YA QUE LA UNION FERROVTARIA ES EL. SINDICATO MAS PODEROSO DE LA AR-

GENTINA,=

3.- La CCT Argentina se ha lanzado ya q un en= >
frentamiento abierto contra cl gobierno militar de Onganfa, Fl proxi-
mo miercoles 14 habra un paro general de 24 horas, como protesta con-
tra cl escandaloso aumento del costo de vida, contra el "arbitrajo
obligatoria” v en apoyo do los gremios en conflicto,~

On 3)had only the following to add concerning
<(cRaimundo ONGARO and his activities:—After ONGARO had made his

Vislent Speech on television if Santo Domingo he was cornered
by the Cuban (exile) delegation the members of which were in-
censed by his allegations concerning Cuban exiles and his
misinformation about the Castro regime. According to ANICE-31
their arguments prevailed and ONGARO in the end was quite
apologetic and admitted to them (ANICE-31 thought sincerely)
that he had been in error. As proof of the sincerity of
ONGARO's change of mind on the Cuban question AMICE-31 pointed
to the fact that, on behalf of the Cuban delegation, ONGARO
approached Juan Luis GALLO Estevez, the intransigent Uruguayan
whose negative vole (the only one) doomed the Ci.ban~sporsored
resolution on political prisoners to defeat, and tried to get
him to go along with the majority.

2. AMICE-31 called ONGARO basically "un buen muchacho"
and non-Communist. He reported that ONGARO was a strong
peronista and a "good, practicing Catholic”. ‘added this
atter description with some wonderment because he had always
placed "good, practicing Catholics” automatically in the pro-
U.S., anti-Castro camp.

Headquarters has con ered the invitations
received by AMICE-31 and nas reached the following
conclusions on his proposed travel:

A. There seems no useful gurpose to be served
by covering AHICE-3l's personal éxpenses for
the trip described in paragraphs 1 end 2 of
the referenced dispatch ss WCFACT has good
coverage fron other sources.

B. Headquarters has no interest in AHICE-31's:
attendance at the meeting described in
paragraph 3 but also no objections to his

i accepting the invitation if Station JMWAVE -

H _deens it advisable or considers this will be

of value in any of the Station's own

operations.

1 1. Attached is AMICE-31's report on the neeting of the
“fighth Continental Council of the Confederacion Latinoamericana

i de Sindicatos Cristianos (CLASC, Latin American Confederation

i of Christian Trade Unions), held in Medellin, Colombia, from

4 § to 14 January 1966.

2. Since the Station has not received copies of any
disseminations that may have been made from information cabled
during the meeting at Medellin, no attempt has been made to
prepare portions of AMICE-31's report for dissemination. If any
of the report is disseminated at Headquarters, the Station would
Appreciate receiving copies, along with copies of any reports
that may already have been disseminated on the meeting at

, Medellin, and any future disseminations on the CLASC.

3. Also attached, under separate cover, is a copy of a
report by Keith G. BONGIRNO which includes a list of AMICE-31's
achievements at the meeting and his impressions of and attitudes
toward certain delegates and issues.

PICo's TRY? 70 MEDELLIN
~~" Apter reading Pico's report and talking to hin twice I reached following

conclusiens 1

T acmayEteyss «| Pico.

1, Achieved with the cooperation of ager Maduro te soften the anti-Us
line in the Declaration of Principles and elimination of US name which

was xx replaced by "imporialisas",

 ... 2» RXEOMCIKKDOUAATOUKE Logether with the Venezuelan delegates drafted
the motion condemning the Tricontinental Conferences and participated actively
in druming up the support for this motions

3. Pushed thru the motion condemning Castro's regimes

4, Excoreised a strong cati-conmnist and enti-Castre influence among the
"_dologates,

LLIN MEETING

1, Pheo.cane back favorably impressed by strongly anti-cocmunist stand of the
delegates, Hs says that even if Maspere would try to cooperate with the
commios the rank and file will not let him to do so,

2. Pico noted only, three rabid anti-US delegates $ Miguol Caniose(Accion
Sindical Uruguayg, Diogenes Gutierrez( Federacion Istmeha de Trabajedores
Cristianos -Panama) and Heliodoro Agudelo Rivera(Accion Sindical Antioquena) «
Eee

“3, Pico informs that Henry Molina( Sec,Gen.of Confederacion Autonona de Sindicates
Cristianos CASC=D. Re ) even tf highly critical of US intervention in D.R. is
an outspoken peimmunt st and he retomiends him as a material for recruitmonte

Molina spoke very favorably of Conrado Rodrigues who during his stay in D.R,
as FORDC delegate made an excellent impression and. became good friend of

CASC

Tt 4s evident from tho briefing instructions received from HQ and cables
received from “our man in Medellin® that a strong spposition te CLASC uQ
atand (or Haspera's) to the new funding proposal by GISC and ISI was expected.
Pico says that ho could not discever auch eppesition and that three national
unions vAich already applied for direct funding according th the instructions
received from CISC quickly withrew their application, Eico alse did not note
any "betrayal" on the part of Foderscian Campesina.

5.

Tous I see two possibilities + a) the opposition to CLASC HQ stand that all
funding should go thru #Q was exaggerated b) Pico 49 considered aa close {jurul
oe Sgapero and was ‘not trusted by the eppesition.

ihacconting te Pico the fooling was quite unantacus the the funding sheuld go
\ thru CiASC HQ end the CISC attempt of direst funding was resontad a2 an effort
Vite undermine ClAg¢ Executive Cosmittos,

re) ae)

6. It looks that our friend who talked to Pico in Medellin and Bogota was
disgusted because Pico was satisfied with the results of the meeting. Picola
satisfaction stewned from the strong antis“astro stand the Council adopted 1

and 4t 4: obvious that the funuing problem so important to us celid not < upsst

hia, > .

2» Pico reports that there is a good chance that Dagoberto Genzalez( Sec.Gon.of
Trabajadores Copeyanes) will be olected as CLASC president at the next CLASC
Congress, According to hin Jose Goldsack will becone Treasurer and present
treasurer Alfredo di Pacco will hoeditiew CLASC office dedicated to raiso funde
from the LA affiliates,

Pico cousiders Gonzalez as a Staunch anti~conqunist and better disposed tovard |
than ‘Raspero, He thinks that flanked by Gonzales and Geld sack, Maspere wail
not have so mich to say and his power will be limited. Gonzalez is apparently s
much more forceful personality than Goldsack, who doesn't have onough guts to

eppose Maspero.

8. Pico believes that Haspero is less aggressive and anti-US as he used to be, He ~
thinks that the preSsure from CISC and ISI plus a strong anti-commnist posture
pf the affiliates accounts for this.

In the cables received from our Colombia office there is a strong criticism of
Pico as a sort of Maspero's stooge. After discussiong this topic several tines
with Pico I think that his opinion of Maspero udHKi 4s +

vdvcoied :
Maspero 4s a forceful, dfnante and well Sepssrns? leader. As igh Argentine and
ex-peronista he has more drive and is a better erganizer than the others in
CLASC, Besides he offers CLASC a promise of bringing CTG into an alliance with
then, a feat which only he can accomplish, For Pico's taste “aspare is too
demagogic and he doesn't like his anti-US and soft of comales attitude, hovever,
Pico clains that Maspero lately ig much mere aware of come danger. As Maspero
is without doubt the most powerful single individual in CLASC end as Pico posits
4s weak(his Federation 4s not created yot and ho has to ke confirmed as Secretar
General) he sees no use of bucking Maspere especially as no organized and strong
. opposition exists. Pico,however, would see with sympathy “aspero power restricte
or it will not bother hin al all to see “aspero removed coapletoly. “ut as long
as he exists Pico believes that for his personal good and in order to bo able te
push strong anti-Vastro etand(in which he 4s mainly interested) he has te work
ard live with Maspero,
This position impresses me as a sensible one.

TIT HISC. REMARKS :

1, Thore 4s some Anconsistence in the cables we received, In eno of then Rosano
Tschumi, CLASC Executive Secretary for the Dutch Antilles and President of cepsy
4s described as ® widely considerad insignificant and unipresive eleaent*, In
another cable this same Techunie is quoted as a source ( direct source not via
Pico as Pico said that he didn't know about campesinos sold out) and as a now
CLASC Asst Secretary Goneral(Pigg also claims that he doesn't know about it oven
Af he was eritici89dbefore: sexi hina getting his info from such a Jousy source
as 4schunte).

pe Jue bah,
2. Phco reports that in Caracas he mot Carl Nerden from ISI Benn effico in
CLASC office. Carlos Moris( vice-directora of Instituto do Estudios Pocleles di
Caribe}, Mariano Senites(Centro Dequaentacion -“eracas) Santiago Tortosa(Sea Gea
of CODKSA), Baequiol Borges(CI3) wore also present, Nonion reperted that the



US Esdassy in Bonn informed than on Sunday Yea, 16th in the morning about
ell inportant totpics discussed, resolutions ote adusted in Nedeilin, waile
Amprossed by the fast work and correct reporting ag Nomen oxpressed his
curiosity as. to how it was possible that the exbassy in Bonn was so fast
informed ( NOTE : I an surprised yen more that « biubber-nouth like orden
was informed about such report!). “he general cansonsus of tho present was that

CIA aust have few men infiltrated among the delogateseceee

Je Accbriing to the new by-laws Pico's Transport Federation(in formation) will hav:
3 votes during the next Congress, equal to other L,A, Federations and national
delegations, Threfore it is inportant for us that we continue to work with Pico,

Pheo should also-go to the CIASC meeting in Guatemala in March when the Central
American Confederation will be crested. CLASC also wants to create Central
Anorican Transport Federation and there where Pico's presence is requesteds

&

Se T asked Pico Af his CLASC friends don't ‘resent the fact that he works for FORDC.
He said that this problea was solved once for ever, CLASC executives know that
nly two principal c&rrenta existy aitong the Cuban exiled laber s the batistiar
and the revolutioneries, The Batistianos are the Mujalistas of Cit aided by ORIT
and CLASC is against the Mujalistas. They are in favor of the revolutionaries an

they are in FORDC, which is the only really active exile labor organizations.
GLASC leaders know that FORDC is being supported by the US goverment , but they
accept it aa a necessity and understand that 1t is inevitable as neither the
batistianos er the comunists will support it and CLASC has no funds to do so.

sueaya OP

randy
By no means I consider that Pico is an ideal agent. He dfvht be influenced or awed
by Haspero, Ho also is sometimes inpulsive and puts his foot in the mouth. On tho
other hand he is 1 young, agressive, better educated than average Cuban labor loade;
He is accspted in CLASC, his erganization ORT is a fatk member and he will be the
hoad of the Latin American Transport Federation which will give him following
advantages $ a) voice and 3 votes at CLASC mestings b) can influence CLASC decisions
c) will bring strong anti-Castro and anti-comunist influence d) will soften up
anti*iS outbursts 9) will report to us, oven if te have to take his reliability wit
a grain of salte :

NOTE s I forget to call your attention to the curious Uittle item in Pico's repor

He advises that the-Copsyanos gained the control of the Sindicato Portuario 1n
Porte Cabello wrestling at away fron Correa after at was found that 200,000
bolivares were missing fron the treasury. Pico also reports that there are
widespread ruaors that Correa is living it up at the expense of the boycott
and that he is blackmailing Spanish, Japanese and British embassies setting hard

Facilitate Entry of Identity A

1, Identity A, who is the mother of AMICE/31, a Station asset,
has been twice denied permission to enter the United States as a
refugee from Cuba. The local ODURGE office has stated that
Tdentity. A has been placed on a denied admissions list because of

information supplied by ODACID.

2. According to AMICE/31, Identity A applied for admission to
the United States with her daughters, Identities B and C, Identi-
ties B and C received the necessary authorization on 24 February
1966 from the Swiss Embassy and arrived in the United States by air

on 28 February.

3, Identity A was the wife of Identity D, a member of the
Cuban Communist Party for some twenty years, at the time of her
first application to leave Cuba. Identity D died in October of
1688 and according to AMICE/31 lost his Communist Party membership
card about a year prior to his death. According to AMICE/31,
Tdentity A has never joined or been a member of the Communist
Party aithough there is a possibility that her husband may have
placed her name on the membership lists. AHICE/31 also stated that
Pha has long been a practicing Cathclic and that ehe is very anti-
Communist. Sent as separate cover attachments are two statements
from the Bishop of Gienfuegas and the Assistant Bishop of Havana
testifying to her good character and to her standing as a practic-

ing Catholic.

DISPATCH i UFGA 25851

4. It is requested that Headquarters contact the
appropriate ODACID gnd ODURGE officials for the purpose
of removing Identity A's name from the denied admissions
list since her close connection with a member of the Cuban
Communist Party, which presumably was the basis of the
derogatory information, is no longer a fact.
