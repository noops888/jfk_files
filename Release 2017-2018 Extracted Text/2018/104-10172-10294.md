1. By reference dispatch we zenticned an intriguing turn of events
in the Costille/Golub relationship concerning the latter's request for
Costitle te fix hin up with 2 girl, However, we vould first like to bring

you caxpletely up to date on our contact with Golub, We have recently been
ha er of consular xatters which we have dealt with through Golubs
A nusber of Anericans have been calling at the U. S. Fabassy who have not
previously applied for Soviet visas and express 2 desire to travel to the
USSR, Costille has been referring these Anericans directly to Golub at the
Soviet Rubasay, as Golub once told Costille that he had the authority to
grant visas without prior approval frem Moscow. As long as the Anericans
had made travel arrangenénts through a locel travel bureau, as well as hotel
reservaticns, he stated he had rec objections in civing them a viea in a
matter of minutes, We have had four occasions to try Golub out in thie
matter, and a0 fer he has fulfilled his promise, Golub. on 3 August invited
Costille for drinke in’a local bar, end Costille asked hin again if he was
still willing to continue handling the Americans that he referred to Golub
‘at. the Soviet Consulate. Golub stated that he was because he was interested
in having Azcricans visit the Soviet Union, "And besides," he edded, "since
you are allowing Khrushchev to visit the U, S., there is no reason why I
can't let ordinary Arericans cone to the USSR." Golub then began asking
about the official functions of an American Consulate and began comparing his
duites with ours. when he listed his typical duties, he added that it was
his responsibility as a Soviet Consul to hendle Soviet defectors who cone to
Finlend. Colub mentioned that he had just returned from one of his more un~
pleasant duties of recovering the tody of a Soviet sailor, who had gone berserk
‘and had shot and killed a number of Soviet citizens on an island off the coast
of Estonia, stole a small motor launch and headed for Finlend, His body was
found in the sea by a Finrish fishermen near the Finnish island of Mustatavenen
with s Finnish life jacket on, (This was reported in most of the Finnish
newspapers.) Hvidently, the Soviet had attempted to swim for it ind drowned.
Golub stated that he had to go to this island, recover the body and bring it
back to Helsinki where it was put into 2 mortuary, The cause of death was
definitely drowning. The body only had a Finnish life jacket and a pair of
swirming trunks on. They later found the motor boat, but the motor was gone
and there was rothing in the boat. Later a Soviet destreyer came to Helsinki
to retrieve the boty. It was evidently Colub's responsibility to make ell

of these crrengenents. Goltb stated on this evening that he would like to
make a call on the U. S. Cengulate sometime. Costille said that he was welcome
at any tine, The next moming Golub. phoned Cestille to say he would like to
wmurr cone over. He arrived carrying a number of Soviet visa and other. formas
He recained in the Ccnsulate for about an hour and asked =any questions as

to consular duties and U.S, citizenship. He departed inviting Costille to
pay a sintlar call on hin at the Soviet Consulate. The next day Costille
pkoned Golub to ask if he might come over tc see the Soviet Consulate. We

also wanted to introduce to Golub an Eabassy eazployee, Edward 5erg, who is

in Helsinki through the suzer froa the U, $. Bubassy in Feris on TOY for the
purpose of helping the Eabassy with the nunber of VIP and other Azerican
tourists esing to the U.S. fair in Moscow. Since he has alse been handling
sone visa prebiers, we wanted hin te meet Gelub, Golub welcomed Costille

and Serg at the Seviet Consulate eni teok then inte his office where the three
chatted fer abcut 20 minutes. Costille clso had with hin the vises of two
Americen women whe wanted to spend one mere day in the Soviet Union and to
take the train rather than fly. Golub made the necessary clanges cn treir
visas without a question, At this tine Golub invited Cestille ard Perg to

have lunch with Rin on 10 August.

ry Saturday evening,

had
that he knew a 2sed Fir
trustworthy and could hendle the situation,
soparcte scver ss Identity, On friday evening, Cestitle contacted Iden to
briefly exelata whst she shculd expect, Iden is atout 31 years old, extrenely
attractive, well dressed, speaks toth Finnish and inglish, end remsed very
coorerative. ¥e told her thot Golub was tte Soviet. Consul, a personal friend
of Costilie's, urhaprily married with his wife who wes in Moscow, and that

he had recuested a date, She mentioned that it sc=nded interesting and that
she weuld be ready for anything, We told her nothing about any operational
Interest in Golub but mentioned we would lixe to keep posted on the relation=
ship, However, we strossed that as far as Golub vas concerned Iden and
Costille had known each other before and had dsted. She unterstood this
corpletely. Our only reservations cbout Iden was that she is far from an
"intellectual" and hee a rather silly giggle. There would be only one reason
why Golub would be interested in Iden, and this would not be for her minds

3. Tae evening was Ze atnner dancing at 2 local night spot. Also
attending were Subsect of[OF/A)2918, Berg and anothor Ancrican teaching school
fn Helsirki. Golub seeued toenjoy himself trenendously, was always at ease,
put preferred Costille's date to his own. Ke peid very little attention to
Iden. although he was pleasant te her; he only talked at length with her when
he felt it necessary to be polite. Golub danced with all the girls end
appeared to be a passable dencer, A night club photographer was asked to teke
a photo cf Golub with his dete while dencing. The picture turned out with a
profile stot (however recognizable) of Golub, but unfortun.tely hi: datets
faco was cocpletely hidden, Golub was net avare of this photo. (The original
we are keeping in cur files but have atteched a thernofax copy.) The only
ve reeatian corth reporting waa that Cosi Me asked Subject of (OFHAj2918, CC
who is a teacher of English in Helsinki, 4f she wuld be willing”to teach soze
Soviet diplomats English. Sho agreed, tut nothing core has been heard cn thia
Score, Gelub then requested that we continuo the evening in his apartzent
