Since 4/17/61, there has been little organized
anti-CASTRO activity in the Metropolitan New York area. The
activity which has taken place since April, 1961, has been
dominated by the Frente Revolucicnario Democratico (FRD), and
this activity has taken the form of pickets and public meetings.
There has been activity by the Junta de Liberacion Nacional
{JLN), and the individual groups within the framework of -the
FRD have also sponsored individual meetings. Dr. CARLOS PRIO
SOCARRAS, former President of Cuba, was scheduled to hold a
meeting in New York on 9/30/61, but this meeting was allegedly
cancelled on advice given by unknown individuals from Washington,
D.C. '

ARAGON said that MIRO CARDONA went to PRIO's residence in

Miami and asked for PREO's support and anything that PRIO could
do that could enhance the position of the Revolutionary Council.
ARAGON advised that at this meeting PRIO promised his support,
but also asked Dr. MIRO to put several of his, PRIO's, men on
the payroll of the Revolutionary Council. ARAGON stated that Dr.
MIRO told him that the Council did not handle the money, as this
was at thet time handled directly by the FRD. ARAGON stated
that Dr. MIRO and CARLOS PRIO have met several times since

and on each occasion Dr. PRIO has infermed Dr. MERO that he 1g
in support of Dr. MIRO but then PRIO goes on and makes propaganda
which definitely is against Dr. MIMO and in his, PRIO's, favor.
ARAGON advised that as a result of recent statements made vy

Dr. PRIO, Dr, MIRO CARDONA no longer has any desire to speak
with CARLOS PRIO.

WY 2865-S advised that in early September, 1961,
he was with GUILLERMO ALONSO PUJOL in New York, and PUJOL
showed him a confidential letter on the atationery of the U.S,
House of Representatives written by VICTOR L, ANFUSO to Secretary
of State DEAN RUSK. NY 2865-8 stated he was not sure of the
date of this letter but believed it was 8/27 or 28/61. In this
letter to DEAN RUSK, Representative ANFUSO asked RUSK to
recognize a Cuban government in exile and offer 1% all the
necessary assistance in order te overthrow the present Cuban
Government, ANFUSO also, in his letter to RUSK, stated that
Dr. CARLOS PRIO had supported Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA as
Provisional President in the event such a government in exile
was recognized by the United Statea..

From information available thusfaer, there does not
appear to be any definite plans on the part of CARLOS PRIO to
set up a government in exile in a Latin country. The Cuban
exiles are divided about PRIO and the majority of them greatly
question his ability to unify a majority of Cubans.

(4) INVASION EFFORTS

There has been no information received from Cuban
exiles in the Metropolitan New York area indicating any serious
plans to mount an invasion from the US te Cuba. There are also
no reports of any invasion being planned by individuals in the

have taken place during July, August and September, 1961,

ARAGON stated that he and Dr, MIRO CARDONA discussed probleme
facing the Revolutionary Council and what the Revolutionary
Council believes should be done in the Cuban question. He

also advised that the main difficulty of the Revolutionary
Council ig with liaison with CIA, ARAGON steted that eat his

last meeting with RICHARD GOODWIN on 9/14/61, GOODWIN advised
that there was a retired Colonel from the New England area,

how undew trensfer to Miami, whe would act as lipison man between
Dr. MIRO SARDONA, the White House and CIA, ARAGON stated that
he was informed by GOODWIN that this man would have cemplete
authority to make final decisions in all matters, ARAGON
advised that as of 9/25/61, when he last spoke to Dr, MIRG
CARDGNA, Dr. MIRO stated that, he had not yet. been contasted

by this liaison man. ARAGON also stated that neither he

nor Dr. MIRO CARDONLwas given the name of this man, but they
were informed that Dr. MIRO would be contacted by this individual
on his arrival in Florida.

ARAGON also expressed his personal opinionregarding
RICHARD GOODWIN and other advisors at the White House by stating
that they were very brilliant young men who can advance wonderful
theories but cannot put anything inte practical working order.

ARAGON also stated that CIA continues to operate
with various underground groups, and these groups are being
supported by CIA, ARAGON advised that the underground inside
Cuba is being built up and it is becoming efficient, but ARAGON
believes. that there is a lack of coordination and a lack of
authority and although it is possible by underground activity to
overthrow the present Cuban Government; he believes that
unless this matter of unification is attended to inmediately,
the end result could be chaos and untold bloodshed.

ARAGO} piso stoted that hig contact at CIA ig one
AYMOND 8, CLARKPwith whom he is in regular contact and who
znibhes him mOney which he carries to Miami for Dr, MIRG CARDONA,
ARAGON advised that the Revolutionary Couneil has been given

hampered the activity of the Revolutionary Council, ARAGON

the Revolutionary Council by four, and he, ARAGON, had given
the nemes of the four individuals to ROBERT HURWITCH, of State
Department, to see if the State Department opposed any of these
individuals, ARAGON identified the four proposed members of the
Revolutionary Couneil as RICARDS LORTg NINO DIAZ, JORGE SOTUS,
and CONTE AGUERO, ARAGON advised that he furnished these names
to ROBERT HURWITCH on 9/20/61, and he had to go to Washington
on 9/2 foi to see EL. fo pick up some money, and upon meeting
with (CLARK, CL, nformed him thet the four people proposed
for the Revolutfomd4ry Council by br. MIRO were acceptable to
CIA, and stated that as a general rule of thumb, Dr. MIRO can
select anyone he wants but mast ex@lude all Batistianos, Communists
and fellow travelers.

ARAGON stated that he was not entirely optlmistic
about the future of Cuba. ARAGON said thet the Cuban people
cannot be entirely unified as there are so many politically
ambitious leaders among the exiles and there are any jealousies
and there is much criticism Leveled against the Revolutionary
Council and the United States Government. because of the
unsuccessful invasion of April, 1961, ARAGON advised that ‘he
betdieved that the Cuban Government was weakened day by day, :
that the underground would eventually overthrow CASTRO, together
with the economic hardships which the Guban Government is
suffering, but without a strong unifiedopposition and 100
per cent cooperation from the United States, he saw a very
unhappy pieture for Cuba in years to come.

above information is disseminated, extreme care be used concerning
information furnished by ERNESTO ARAGON, ARAGON has cooperated
