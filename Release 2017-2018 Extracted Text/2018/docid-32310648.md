type which is sought by JURE is that equipment used by

the United States Armed Forces.

JURE has some boats in the Miami area, and also

has a 50-foot boat, location unknown, that can be used

for infiltration purposes. JURE has two .20 mm cannons and

other miscellaneous military equipment. It is planned that

five or six infiltration teams, each team consisting of

five or six individuals, will be sent to Cuba.

- Finances -

JUNTA PAVOLUCIONARIACUBANA

JURE 1s presently

selling bonds to raise

money

to pay for the organization's expenses. J. JA/MARABOTTO,

formerly a Vice-President of a bank in Cuba, is presently

U)

employed in a bank in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

MARABOTTO handles

JURE's finances, and has recently arranged for a bank in

San Juan to grant a loan of $125 to any Cuban exile in

Puerto Rico. Of the $125, JURE will receive $92, and the

rest of the money goes for interest, stamps and administrative

costs. The individual has one year to repay the $125 loan.

If the money is not repaid, JURE guarantees the loan. As

a result of these loans and bond sales, JURE has been able

to raise between $25,000 and $30,000 in Puerto Rico, and

about $1,200 in the Los Angeles area.

- Military Sectión -

LARRACA advised that MANUEL CASTRO, VARELA

Elizabeth, New Jersey, was formerly a Colonel in the

Cuban Army, and is a well-considered military man, with an

excellent reputation. CASTRO has accepted the position of

Military Chief of JURE. He is expected to come to Miami

and formalize the military part of the organization, and to

choce a General Staff..

ALVAREZ AÄSCRI

GUEZ

On February 6, 1964, SANTIAGO ALVAREZ/RODRIGUEZ,

541 Northwest 45th Avenue, Miami, advised he was former-y

one of the leaders of Comandos I (C-L), an organization

which has conducted raids against Cuba. ALVAREZ advised

that JURE, through its leader, MANUEL RAY, has very good

contacts in the Cuban Militia and Rebel Army. ALVAREZ

stated that JURE has a large quantity of arms and munitions.

ALVAREZ said he recently returned from Columbus, Georgia, where

he talked to a reliable individual who claims to have sold a

considerable quantity of arms to RAY, and delivery was made

to an island in the vicinity of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.

ALVAREZ stated he had no doubt that RAY would try to establish

some military activity in Cuba in the near future.

On February 28, 1964, CARLOS ZARRAGA advised

that

JURE's bond sales had increased considerably, and the

organization has sold between $50,000 and $75,000 worth of flilk:

bonds.

This money was used by the organization for expenses

and purchases of additional military equipment. The largest

donation given to the organization was from ROMULO, BETANCOURT,

President-of Venezuela, with whom RAY had recently conferred.

LARRAGA continued that RAY has publicly stated

he plans to be in Cubaby May 20 1964; final preparations

are being made, and there is no doubt that RAY will be

there by the time announced.

On March 5, 1964, JOAQUIN GODOY, head of the

anti-CASTRO organization Movimiento Revolucionario del

Pueblo. (MRP), advised it is his opinion that RAY will

open a small

operation in Cuba for about three or four

months beginning sometime in May. RAY will then return

to the United States on a big organization drive, for the

purpose of establishing a large unity movement for the

eventual return to Cuba.
