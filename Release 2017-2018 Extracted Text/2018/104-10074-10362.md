July 11, 1972

On June 5, 1972 a reliable source was

• advised by Wu, Chun (Attache,, P.R.G. Embassy, Ottawa)

that the China Peoples' Friendship Association in

Peking would like to invite three or four of the

leading members of Susan WARREN's group to visit China

in June or July 1972 or any other time convenient to

them. WARREN apparently had no previous knowledge of

this invitation. WU did not identify the individuals

who would possibly participate in the trip to China.
