that Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA would rezizn his post as head
of the Cuban Revolutionary Council. The article said
exile sources gave two possibilities for his resignation,
One faction believed that MIRO's recent trip to Washington
from which he returned Sunday (April.7) was to pin down the
United States Government to a statement of positive policy
regarding Cuba. Another schsol of thought was that the
Council head was retiring from his poet in protest of
Government curbing of hit-and-run raids on the Comuunist
ieland of Cuba,

The article went on to state that Dr. MIRO's
leadership in the Council, aimed at uniting all Cuban
exiles, has been burdened by protlems since his appointment
in March 1961,

plans, 1t will do so without consideration
