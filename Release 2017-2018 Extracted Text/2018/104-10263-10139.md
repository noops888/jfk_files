Reference and have submitted the following comments and
question: H

1. “We have a number of questions about this document
on which we should be grateful for your comments, and as
background to some of these we think it will be useful for
you tohave. an account of (QANNE-ELHIS, dealings with AELADLE:

Ree ol

a, “They date from June 1961 when he was con-
sidering a visit to the U.S.3.R. He mentioned this to the
Soviet Ambagtador, whom he met at. the Quee Brthday
Celebration in Helsinki, (he did not realise at first that
dt was the Ambassador co whom he was talking), The Ambassador

<"puggested that he should get in touch with Ivan Efimovich
BEROGEEV, an identified R.I.S. officer, wb

bd, “Between 5th and 15th July 1961 (enime-EiaTs
went to the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy to seo
about the viea. Apparently he. did not eee SERCFEV but met
AELADLE who showed a good deal of curiosity about him and
asked whether he had ever been to the U.S.3.R. before,
whether he had applied in London for a visa, what he was
doing in Helsinki ste, The possibility of ABLADLE taking
English lessons from WYNKE-ELLIS)was mentigned and AELADLE
paid he would get in?touch wit, IYYNNE=E! Sigpout this. He
asked for a short biogfphy of IE-ELLIS)~

co. “He brought the visa application forms and his
biography to AELADLE two daye later and although AELADLE was,
apparently very busy he aeked WYNNE-ELLIS) for glarification
of various details. AELADLE did es otal Bagliah lessons

a, at the end of September, or beginning of

Octobex 1961, ivwNECELLTS received a letter from AELADLE

nz for the address of’his pen friend in Ruesia, Stanislav

IN, who had, been concerned in (erine- stra renruitment
by the R.I.Sh (QYHNE-ELLIS) telephoned AELADLE to say that
he did not have the new addreas. AELADLE told him that if
he wanted it, he could have a visa ‘tomorrow! to visit
Stalingrad (now Velgograc) end. in the ceurse of conversation
said 'gometines it is better to visit places but not old
friends', We wondered at the time, and ever more after
AELADLE's defeotion, whether this remark had any special
significance. :

ab
e. “on 16th November AELADLE invited (WYNNE-ELLIS)
to attend a Soviet concert, AELADLE toid him that he had
peen granted a tourist view but that if he wished to vioit
his pen friend he would require a letter of invitation Crom
him, AELADLE asked about Hs Britigh frionds in Helsinki and
said that he would phone W@YNNE-ELLID next week to make a
further appointment, He Ad pot do this, urea 7

that GYNNE-ELLIS*had had a hand in AELADLE's defection,

4, “our questions on the(WYNNE-ELLIS) doounent mupplied
by AELADLE are as follows:

a. “What is the manuscript word at the top of the
first page, and what ia its significance?

bd, “The two typed worde, one immediately below
the manuscript word on page 1 and the other to the left, are
not legibie on our copy,

co. “Is there any significance in the date 11th
“Movember being in inverted commas, thus "11"?

da. “We are puzzled by what at first sight appeared
to be a date, 22,XII.1961, in the heading immediate}v above
the text on page 1. In fact the Roman numerals 'Xii‘ are
the cyrillic letter X77, but we do not understand their
meaning, Can AELADLE explain this?

e, “What is the name in which the document is
Bigned, and does AELADLE know the true identity of this person?

f.d"ve are a little surprised at the oyrillic trans-
literation of YNNE-ELLIS" name, We should have expected the
KGB to have a eystem which would enable them to get back to
the correct English spelling. Admittedly (AINNE-ELLIS) 8 name
is an awkward one to deal with. oG

g. "We should have expected that ABLADLE would havo
gent a trace request to his Headquarters shortiy after the
first meeting with (/YNNE-ELLIS in July 1961, Yet the reply
was apparently sent~only on llth November, Can AELADLE
