JOSEPH - ‘MOODY, U. S, Coast Guard, Miami Beach,
Florida, who is a diver attached to this Coast Guard Station,
was. interviewed ie ncerning. ithe .Size..and nature of the-hole
in the bottom of. the "Caribbean Venture," MOODY has seven
bach dh hg oc beared and during the course. of this i
ce has conducted a variety of unde: ‘i
for the U.S, Coast Guard, ee eee

After examining the underside of the “Caribbean
Venture", HOODY stated that although the visibility was very
poor due te the murky water and location of the ship, he
would estimate that the hole blown in the bottom was approxi=
mately three feet wide and five feet long. He stated this
hole was located amidships slightly to the starboard side,
and appears to have occurred in the area where two strainers™ |
er grills are located over the main water injection intake. |
(After reviewing a sketch of the ship shown to him by the ~~ '
Engineer, MOODY stated this would appear to be in the area i
ef ribs 55, 56, and 57}. MOODY stated that the strainers,
er grills that are attached to the intakes are attached to
the bottom of the ship with numerous bolts and that to take
eff one of these grills or strainers is a three or four.
hour job. He stated that during the course of his Coast
Guard duties, he has, on occasion, removed such a strainer
and that is on what he bases his opinion.

MOODY advised that after observing the hole, he
would say that the explosion was caused by an explosive :
which was attached to one of the Strainers or grills, inas-"**
much as all metal in that area’ was blown inward. He stated
he could not locate either one of the grills which should
be cevering the intake, and that he presumes they were
either blown into the ship, a blown into pieces and fell
to the bottom of the harbor.

MOODY stated that in his opinion, the explosive
was attached to the grill, probably either by wire of some
type of toggling device by a swimmer who used air tanks.

MOODY advised that the hole in the bottom of the
ship was large enough for both he and the diver from

the Dade County Public Safety Department to enter and
observe the interior. He stated, however, that due

to the poor visibility, approximately one foot, he was
unable to ascertain if any parts of the hull, the strainer,
or explosive devices were located inside.

MOODY stated that judging from his own past
experience, he would say that the explosive was attached
to the strainer or grill by an experienced skin diver.
He stated this diver would, of necessity, have had to
use underwater swimming tanks inasmuch as he knows of
no one.who could have accomplished such a feat without
the aid of tanks. He stated that he believes that in-this
ship, or any other ship, the injection intakes can be
located by an experienced diver by merely locating the
smokestack on the ship and proceeding across the hull
dead center from the stack. The intake could then be
located by swimming either 15 or 20 feet fore or aft
from that section, MOODY stated, however, that in
order to locate anything on the underside of <he ship,
it takes a very experienced diver either using the seams
of the ship, or a compass in order to keep from getting
disoriented due tc the darkness.

MOODY stated that he believes that this hold
was made by « "shape charge", °

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date August 14, 1968

JOSEPH. MOODY, U. S. Coast Guard, Miami Beach,
Florida, who is a diver attached to this Coast Guard Station
was. interviewed concerning. ‘the .size and nature of the-hole = '
in the bottom of the "Caribbean Venture." MOODY has seven
years diving experience and during the course of this
experience has conducted a variety of underwater missions
forthe U. S, Coast Guard, ©

After examining the underside of the “Caribbean
Venture”, MOODY stated that although the visibility was very
poor due te the murky water and location of the ship, he A
would estimate that the hole blown in the bottom was approxi-
mately three feet wide and five feet long. He stated this
hole was located amidships slightly to the starboard side, . _
and appears to have occurfed in the area where two strainers”
er grills are located over the main water injection intake. |
(After reviewing a sketch of the ship shown to him by the
Engineer, MOODY stated this would appear to be in the area
of ribs 55, 56, and 57}. MOODY stated that the strainers,
or grills that are attached to the intakes are attached to
the bottom of the ship with numerous bolts and that to take
eff one of these grills or strainers is a three or four.
hour job. He stated that during the course of his Coast
Guard duties, he has, on occasion, removed such a strainer
and that is on what he bases his opinion.

MOODY advised that after observing the hole, he
would say that the explosion was caused by an explosive
which was attached to one of the strainers or grills, inas- ~~
much as all metal in that area was blown inward. He stated
he could not locate either one of the grills which should
be cevering the intake, and that he presumes they were
either blown into the ship, a@ blown into pieces and fell
to the bottom of the harbor.

MOODY stated that in his opinion, the explosive
was attached to the grill, probably either by wire of some
type of. toggling device. by a.swimmer who used air tanks.

MOODY advised that the hole in the bottom of the

the Dade County Public Safety Department to enter and
observe the interior. He stated, however, that due

to the poor visibility, approximately one foot, he was
unable to ascertain if any parts of the hull, the strainer,
or explosive devices were located inside.

MOODY stated that judging from his own past
experience, he would say that the explosive was attached
to the strainer or grill by an experienced skin diver.
He stated this diver would, of necessity, have had to
use underwater swimming tanks inasmuch as he knows of
no one. who could have accomplished such a feat without
the aid of tanks, He stated that he believes that in this
ship, or any other ship, the injection intakes can be
located by an experienced diver by merely locating the
smokestack on the ship and proceeding across the hull
dead center from the stack. The intake could then be
iocated by swimming either 15 or 20 feet fore or aft
from that section, MOODY stated, however, that in
order to locate anything on the underside of the ship,
it takes a very experienced diver either using the seams
of the ship, or a compass in order ty keep from vetting
disoriented due te the darkness,

MOODY stated that he believes that this hold
was made by “ "Shape charge",

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date August 14, 1968

SOSEPH MOODY, U. S. Coast Guard, Miami Beach, |
Florida, who ig a diver attached to this Coast Guard Station,
was. interviewed concerning the size.and nature of the hole
in the bottom of the "Caribbean Venture," MOODY has seven
qoare dieing experience and during the course of this

£ iS conducted a variety of underwa
for the U. 8, Coast Guard, a : oe ee

After examining the underside of the “Caribbean os
Venture", MOODY stated that although the visibility was very 1
poor due to. the murky water and location of the ship, he
would estimate that the hole blown in the bottom was approxi-
mately three feet wide and five feet long. He stated this
hole was. located amidships slightly to the starboard side, i
and appears to have occurged in the area where two strainers~
er grills are located over the main water injection intake.
(After reviewing a sketch of the ship shown to him by the
Engineer, MOODY stated this would appear to be in the area
of ribs 55, 56, and 57}. MOODY stated that the strainers,
or grills that are attached to the intakes are attached to
the bottom of the ship with numerous bolts and that to take
eff one of these grills or strainers is a three or four. _,
hour job. He stated that during the course of his Coast
Guard duties, he has, on occasion, removed such a strainer
and that is on what he bases his opinion.

MOODY advised that after observing the hole, he : ‘|
would say that the explosion was caused by an explosive — i
which was attached to one of the strainers or grills, inas-
much as all metal in that area was blown inward. He stated
he could not locate either one of the grills which should
be cevering the intake, and that he presumes they were
either blown into the ship, af blown into pieces and fell
to the bottom of the harbor.

. MOODY stated that in his opinion, the explosive
was attached to the grill, probably either by wire of some
type of toggling device by a swimmer who used air tanks.

HOODY advised that the hole in the bottom of the

the Dade County Public Safety Department to enter and
observe the interior. He stated, however, that due

to the poor visibility, approximately one foot, he was
unable to ascertain if any parts of the hull, the Strainer,
or explosive devices were located inside.

MOODY stated that judging from his own past
experience, he would say that the explosive was attached
to the strainer or grill by an experienced skin diver.
He stated this diver would, of necessity, have had to
use underwater swimming tanks inasmuch as he knows of
no one who. could have accomplished such a feat without
the aid of tanks. He stated that he believes that in this
ship, or any other ship, the injection intakes can be
located by an experienced diver by merely locating the
smokestack on the ship and proceeding across the hull
dead center from the stack. The intake could then be
located by swimming either 15 or 20 feet fore or aft
from that section. MOODY stated, however, that in
order to iocate anything on the underside of the ship,
it takes a very experienced diver either using the seams
of the ship, or a compass in order to keep from getting
disoriented due te the darkness,

MOODY stated that he believes that this holé
was made by # "Shape charge".
