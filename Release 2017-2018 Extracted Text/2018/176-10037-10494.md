I. . NGO DINK NEU, BROTHER AND POLITICAL'

ADVISOR OF PRESIDENT NGO DINE DIEM,

¡STATED ON 14 FEERUARY 1962 THAT THE STRATEGIC HAMLETS' PROGRAM WOULD BE MORE

THAN À METHOD OF AFFORDING DEFENSE FOR THE POPULATION OF VIETNAM; IT WOULD BE A

BASIC STRANGGY FOR THE LEVELOPMENVI OF VIETNAM. HE SIATED THAT A COMMON COMPLAINI

ier.

IN VIETNAM WAS THS WEAKNESS OF ITS CADRES, WHO FAILED TO TURN THE GOVERNMENT'S

REVOLUTIONARY PROCRAM INTO REALITY. HE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COMPLAINI WAS

ONLY PARTIALLY TRUE, AS THE OTHER ASPECT. HAD BUN THE INABILIIY OF THE CADRE TO

OPERATE IN THE CORDIZION OF INSECURTTY IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. IT WAS NSCESSARY

FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SO ORGANIZE THE SITUATION THAT THE CADRE COULD HE PLACED

MY THE AREA OF HIS WORK AND AFFORDED THE NECESSARY PROTECTION AND FACILITIES

FOR THE WORK.

THE SIRALEGIC HAMLETS'. PROGRAM WOULD' PROVIDE BOTH OF THESE.

2. THE PROGRAM AS PLANNED BY. NHU HAD THREE MAIN ELEMENTS WHICH WOULD MAKE

IT PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR VIETNAM.

IT WAS FIRST OF ALL TRADITIONAL, RESTING UPON THE BASIC UNIT OF

THUS IT CAPITALIZED UPON THS INGRAINED HABITS OF THE

VIEINAMESE SOCIETY.

POPULATION.

B.

THE SECOND ASPECT WAS THAT IT WOULD AFFORD THE MEANS TO MODERNIZE

VIETNAMESE LJFE. NHU STATED THAT IT WAS LESS A PROBLEM OF RAISING THE STANDARD

OF LIVING THAN OF CHANGING THE MODE OF LIVING. HE SAID THAT IF ATTENTION WAS

GIVEN TO INSERTING NEW MODES OF LIFE INTO THE ORDINARY PEASANT'S EXISTENCE, IT

WOULD INEVITABLY BRING SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN HIS ORIENTATION. NHU COMPARED

THE RESULI OF THE INSERTION OF SMALL AUTOMOBILES, WASHING MACHINES, ETC:, INTO

• THE LIFS. OF THE EUROPEAN WORKING CLASS WHICH HE CLAIMED HAD DISRUPTED COMMUNIST

INFLUENCE OVER THIS CLASS. AS A RESULT, NHU SAID, MOST EUROPEAN COMMUNIST

PARTIES OPPOSED MODERNIZATION. HE STATED THAT THE ASIAN COMMUNIST PARTIES

WERE LESS INTELLIGENT IN THEIR APPROACH, AS THEY ADVOCATED MODERNIZATION OF

ASIAN LIFE WITHOUT REALIZING THAT IT WOULD INEVITABLY REDUCE THISIR OWN ORGAN-

IZATIONAL. POWER.

NHU STATED THAT A STUDY OF STEPS APPROPRIATE FOR VIETNAM ALONG

THIS LINE SHOULD HE MADE: AND A CONSCIOUS EFFORT DEVOIED TO INSERTING THESE NEW

MODES OF LIFE INTO VIETNAM.: AS AN EXAMPLE, HE CITED THE' EFFECT OF DISIRIBUTING

BICYCLES WITH MICROMOTORS, THUS MAKING THE PEASANT MOBILE AND CHANGING HIS MODE

OF LIFE. THE SIRATEGIC HAMLET, HE REITERATED, WOULD AFFORD THE NECESSARY

PROTECIION AND ECONOVIC BASIS FOR SUCH A MODERNIZATION: PROGRAM.

C.:

THE THIRD ELEMENT, NEU SAID, WOULD BE DEMOCRATIZATION. HE

DEFINED IT AS THIS APPLICATION. OF JAW AND ORDER TO RURAL LIFE, HE STAIED THAT

AT PRESENT THE PEASANTS WERE EXPOSED TO ILLEGALITY BY THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNISTS

AND BY GOVERNMENT OF VIBINAM (GVN) ELEMENTS; BOTH MILITARY AND CIVIL. THIS WAS

IN PART A RESULT OF THE DISPERSION OF THE POPULATION AND ITS INABILITY TO ASSUME

ITS OWN GOVERNANCE. AS AN INDUCEMENT TO FORM A STRATEGIC HAMIET, NEU SAID THE

POPULATION SHOULD EE ASSURED THAT TEE HAMLET WOULD BE GUARANTEED THE FULI

APPLICATION OF LAW BY IIS OWN AUTHORITIES, THUS MOVING IT TOWARD A SYSTEM OF

DEMOCRAIIZATION APPROPRIATE TO THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, IT WOULD HAVE LITTIE OR

NOTHING TO DO WITH CHANGES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN SAIGON. NEU STATED THAT HE HAD

BROUGET OUT IN A RECENT TALK TO GVN OFFICIALS THAT ONE COULD CHANGE THE .

GOVERNMENT. IN SAIGON 35 TIMES WITH NO EFFECT UPON THE REAL SITUATION IN THE

COUNTRYSIDE; BUT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE STRATEGIC HAMLETS' SYSTEM WOULD

DEFINITELY AFFECT THE INMOCRATIZATION OF THE COUNTRYSIDE IN A WAY WHICH TOUCHED

THE POPULATION ITSELF.

THE STRATEGIC HAMLET WOULD ALSO, ACCORDING TO NEU, AFFORD

A BASIS FOR THE BUILDING OF INSTITUTIONS IN VIEINAM TO GIVE ADDITIONAL STABILITY,

E.G., COOPERATIVES, MEDICAL SERVICES; EDUCATION, WOMENS' MOVEMENTS, YOUTH

MOVEMENTS, DIC.

: 1.30

NHU STATED THAT HE HAD DISCUSSED THE STRATEGIC HAMLETS' CONCEPTS WITH

A GROUP OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS RECENILY, AND HAD MADE ONE VERY SIRONG ADDITIONAL,

POINT TO THEM. (FISLD COMMENT, IVS-7034, IDGS-3/501, 110 GAVE AN ACCOUNT, FROM

A FAIRLY RELIABLE: SOURCE, OF NHU'S REMARKS AT THE MENTING.) HE STATED THAT HE

WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS MUCH DISCONTENT AMONG THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF THE

GOVERNMENT, WHICH, HE SAID, STEMMED FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH IO THE JOB.

ANY LOCAL OFFICIAL WHO FACED A PROBLEM MADE A REQUEST TO HIS NEXT HIGHER AU-

• THORITY FOR ASSISTANCE AND WAS DISCONTENIED IF THE ASSISTANCE WAS INADEQUATE.

THE NEXT LEVEL REQUESTED THE CELEF OF PROVINCE, WHO REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FROM

THE MINISIRY, AND HAD THE SAME REACTION. THE MINISTER MADE THE REQUEST OF THE

PRESIDENT AND WAS DISCONTENTED AT INADEQUATE SUPPORI. THEORETICALLY, THE

PRESIDENT SHOULD MAKE REQUESTS OF THE AMERICANS AND BE DISCONIENIED WITH THE

AMERICANS FOR LACK OF ADEQUATE SUPPORT. NHU STATED THAT' THE ENTIRE PROCESS WAS

INFANTILE, AND A CETIDISE WAY OF LEPENLENCE UPON A SUPERIOR TO SOLVE ONE'S

PROBLEMS. HE STATED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A MATURITY IN THE

VIEINAMESE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY HOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOLVING THEIR

OWN PROBLEMS, UTILIZING SUCH ASSISTANCE AS WAS GIVEN THEM, BUT NOT ATTEMPTING

TO SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. HE STATED THAT THE

STRATEGIC HAMLET WAS THE WAY TO INTRODUCE THE PROCESS OF BEGINNING MATURITY

TO THIS VIEINAMESE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT. NHU SAID THAT THE OFFICIALS WERE

MUCH AMUSED AT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCONTENT AND FOUND MUCH VALIDITY. IN HIS

STATEMENT OF HOW TO OVERCOME IT. HE SAID, HOWEVER, THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO

KEEP REPEATING THE LESSON, AS OTHERWISE THE OLD HABITS OF DEPENDENCE UPON

POWERS ABOVE WOULD RETURN AND THE WHOLE VICIOUS CYCLE OF DISCONTENT WOULD START

AGAIN.

FEBRUARY, STATED THAT NHU HAD GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE STRATEGIC HAMLETS'.

PROGRAM BE CONDUCTED UNDER THE FULL: CONTROL OF THE NEW. INTERMINISTERIAL

COMMISSION. HỆ SAID THAT NHU HAD SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DID

NOT WISE A REFETITION OF THE ERRORS MADE IN THE INITIATION OF THE AGROVILIE

PROGRAM. NHU EMPHASIZED THE NECESSITY OF EXPLAINING TO THE POPULATION WHAT

IT WAS BEING ASKED IO DO AND OF FOLLOWING VERY STRICT RULES, FOR INSTANCE,

THAT THE POPULATION HE ASKED TO ASSIST ONLY IN ITS OWN LOCALITY AND NOT BE

REQUIRED TO WORK ON DISTANT AREAS: HE ALSO STATED THAT THE PROVINCE CHIEFS

WERE INSTRUCIED NOT TO LAUNCH OFF IN ALI DIRECTIONS, CREATING STRATEGIC HAMLETS

ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN IDEAS, BUT TO FOLLOW THE PROGRAM AND PATTERN TO BE

ESTABLISHED EY THS STRATEGIC HAMLETS' COMMITUSE.
