SUMMARY OF INFGRMATI IN:

“~The Agency Operator transferred a call from Subject whe re=
quested to speak with the Chief Agent. Subject alleged to be
publisher of the United Labor News, (circulation 5,000), Toledo,
Ohio, and wanted information on the disposition of one O1ga

's jails. Initially, jee stated
“that "Morgan has been imprisoned for six to seven years, later
changing this, upon questioning, to fifteen years. Subject then
‘seemed uncertain as to when thé invasion occurred. Subject is
calling for Morgan's mother, Mrs. -FNU Morgan, 1909 Collingwood
Avenue, Toledo, Ohio. Cy

Subject appeared to create an impression that he is a real
go~getter who expects a prompt reply to his query. Subject
noted that he would be calling Jack Anderson, syndicated columnis
following his talk with the Ageacy.

Subject was highly sarcastic initially but became less strident!
as the conversation developed. Subject stated that he expected
his call to be returned. He.was advised, ‘however, that a report
of his call would be prepared and passed to appropriate Agency
officials.
