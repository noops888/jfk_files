brother and sister of FIDEL, and CELIA SANCHEZ. Anyone at aii
well versed in the revolutionary days 4f, Asana CASTRO, and

is the secretary and mistress of FIDEL Neancen and was in the
Sierra Maestra Mountains wilth him.

By naming ane we) une NZ, RIVERA probably means t the
well known PEDRO LUI ho fled from Cuba in June ~~

1959, and returned to fae ‘leaflets on Havana in in October, 1959,
denouncing CASTRO as a Communist. SA Rohe N L. SWEET was in

Cuba at that time, as well as when CAMI CIENFUEGOS and his

plane disappeared, and when Major HUBER’ foc was arrested as a
"counter-revolutionary". RIVERA's report\on these matters is

not factual. Major DIAZ LANZ has a brother, MARCOS, but none cue
by the name‘of RAFAEL, insofar as is known to MM 4 3
Special Agent SWEET.

MM 492-S, (and many former close associates of
FIDEL CASTRO support his statement) stated that neither FIDELmr
UL CASTRO ever led anyone in any assault or battle; as a
speaker, FIDEL worked’ Cubans up to a point of excitément where they
would make an attack, as he did in the assault on Moncada Barracks
on July 26, 1953, which gave rise to the famous "July 26 Movement",
but neither CASTRO was ever known to be in the front line, and
for this reason, both RAUL and FIDEL always managed to escape.

MM 105-10317 CONFIDENTIAL

Confidential source, Dr. AGUSTIN CASTELLANOS, a famous
childrens' Heart Specialist now in charge of the cardiac depart-
ment at Childrens Variety Hospital, Miami, Florida, was
extremely active in many charity hospitals in Cuba. One of
these was ONDI, mentioned by RIVERA, and another was the Sacred
Heart Clinic of Dr. ALFRED ANTONETTI, also mentioned by RIVERA.
Dr. CASTELLANOS knows ANTONETTI very well, but he advised
on August 12, 1965, that he could not recall ever having known
RIVERA, or his mother who allegedly works at the Glinic, or
his father who allegedly worked for many years at Casa de
Beneficencia y Maternidad. Dr. CASTELLANOS pointed out that his
failure to recall subject or any of his family does not :
preclude the possibility that each works, or has worked, just as
subject claims they have. : ) -

‘| Dr. CASTELLANOS stated ALFRED CpEREZ, ‘ASELLA is a,
very close friend of his, and now lives goméwhe in Panama,
and even though CASTELLANOS opposed BATISTA's return to powe
and was as active, politically, as his duties as doctor would
allow, he never knew that PEREZ CASELLA was a follower of FIDEL
CASTRO. ae

By subject's own statement, he left Cuba for
the United States, in January 9f1958. Many people who had been
very active in the guerrilla resistance to BATISTA, especially
young men, had been virtually unknown to police authorities
until after CASTRO's advent to power, January 1, 1959. His
story of what happened is therefore not first hand after
January, 1958, and his confusion of names could be due to that,
but it appears to be the usual Cuban desire to give the impression
of being of much greater importance than they really are,
especially that portion indicating that his father wasan
industrialist (shoes) worth over five million dollars in 1961,
when dispossessed by FIDEL CASTRO. Cuba was noted for its
many, small, privately ownéd shoe factories, and a problem
now commented upon by CASTRO controlled newspapers in Cuba,
is that of combining all into one, and taking used parts from the
worst machines to repair and make serviceable the better of the
other machines.
