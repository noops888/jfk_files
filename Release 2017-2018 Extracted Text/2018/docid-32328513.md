FIDEL CASTRO was a member of the violent group known

as Union Insurrectional RevoLucionartz,

LUIR-Insurrectiona

Revolutionary Union) 'of which EMILIO TRO/RIVERO, apparently CUbi

no relation of subject, was the leader, /and who was shot and

killed September 15, 1947.

CASTRO was an active speaker and rabble rouser in 1952,

but was not a leader of anything as of that time.

are not well known to MM 492-S other than RAUL

brother and

sister of FIDEL, and CELIA SANCHEZ. Anyone at

well versed in the revolutionary days of. FIDEL CASTRO, and

COBA

even at present, should know that CELIA SANCHEZ, and not CELIA

CRUZ

is the

secretary and mistress of FIDEL CASTRO, and was in the

Sierra Maestra

Mountains with him.

By naming:

LANZ, RIVERA probably means the

well known PEDRO LUISK DIAZA LANZ,

who fled from cuba in June,

1959, and returned to drop Meaflets on Havana in October, 1959,

denouncing CASTRO as a Communist.

SA EDWIN L. SWEET was

in

Cuba at that time, as well as when CAMIDONCIENFUEGOS and his

plane disappeared, and when Major HUBERI MATOS was arrested as a

"counter-revolutionary"..

RIVERA's report on these matters is

not factual.

Major DIAZ LANZ has a brother, MARCOS,

but none cuße

by the name of RAFAEL, insolar as

Special Agent SWEET.

Is Known to uN A92 Si AEy LANZ

YM 492-S, (and many former close associates of

FIDEL CASTRO support his statement) stated that neither FIDELr

RAUL CASTRO ever led anyone in any assault or battle; as a

speaker, FIDEL worked Cubans up to a point of excitement where they

would make an attack, as he did in the assault on Moncada Barracks

on July 26, 1953, which gave rise to the famous "July 26 Movement",

but neither CASTRO was ever known to be in the front line, and

for this reason, both RAUL and FIDEL always managed to escape.

Confidential source, Dr. AGUSTIN CASTELLANOS, a famous

childrens' Heart Specialist now in charge of the cardiac depart-

ment at Children's Variety Hospital, Miami, Florida, was

extremely active in many charity hospitals in Cuba. One of

these was ONDI, mentioned by RIVERA, and another was the Sacred

Heart Clinic of Dr. ALFRED ANTONETTI, also mentioned by RIVERA.

Dr. CASTELLANOS knows ANTONETTI very well, but he advised

on August 12, 1965, that he could not recall ever having known

RIVERA, or his mother who allegedly works at the clinic, or

his father who allegedly worked for many years at Casa de

Beneficencia y Maternidad.

Dr. CASTELLANOS pointed out that his

failure to recall subject or any of his family does not

preclude the possibility that each works, or has worked, just as

subject claims they have.

Dr. CASTELLANOS stated ALFREDO PEREZ CASELLA is

very close friend of his, and now lives somewhere in Panama,

and even though CAsTELLaNoS opposed BATISTA's return to power

and was as active, politically, as his duties as a doctor would

allow,

he never knew that PEREZ CASELLA was a follower of FIDEL

CASTRO.

By subject's own statement, he left Cuba for

the United States, in January of1958.

Many people who had been

very active in the

guerrilla resistance to BATISTA, especially

young men, had been virtually unknown to police authorities

until after CASTRO's advent to power, January 1, 1959.

His

story of what happened is therefore not first hand after

January, 1958, and his confusion of names could be due to that,

but it appears

to be the usual Cuban desire to give the impression

of being of much greater importance than they really are,

especially that portion indicating that his father was an

industrialist (shoes) worth over five million dollars in 1961,

when dispossessed by FIDEL CASTRO. Cuba was noted for its

many, small, privately owned shoe factories, and a problem

now commented upon by CASTRO controlled newspapers in Cuba,

is that of combining all into one, and taking used parts from the

worst machines to repair and make serviceable the better of the

other machines.
