Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,
31 January 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel:

“Thank you for your memorandum of January 25,
1964, transmitting a detailed chronology of Lee Harvey
OSWALD's stay in the Soviet Union and the alphabetical
list of persons in the Soviet Union who were known to
or mentioned by Lee Harvey OSWALD or his wife.

"Based on an initial review I am confident that
this material will be of great assistance to. the work
of this Commission. However, I have a question re-
garding the mention of an appendix in the Name List.
For example, there are references to "Appendix B'
under items No. 70 and No. 91. I would appreciate
knowing whether one or more appendices have been
prepared to the materials which can be made available
to this Commission."

Letter to Mr. J. Edgar HOOVER, Director, Federal Bu-

reau of Investigation, dated 31 January 1964, from.J. Lee

RANKIN, General Counsel.

"We understand you already have furnished the
Central Intelligence Agency with the Summary Report
entitled ‘Investigation of Assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, November 22, 1963', and accompanying
exhibits; the Summary Report entitled ‘Investigation
of Killing of Lee Harvey OSWALD, Dallas, Texas, 24
November 1963'; and the two Supplemental Reports to
these summaries. At a conference on January 28, 1964,
attended by Mr. MOLLEY and representatives of the
Secret Service and the Central Intelligence Agency,
we discussed the possibility of supplying additional
reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the
Central Intelligence Agency in order to enable that
agency to be of further assistance to the Commission.
It was agreed that F.B.I. reports would be made avail-
able to C.I.A. and that representatives of the two
agencies would consult regarding the precautions to
be taken in the use of these materials.

"Accotdingly, the Commission would appreciate |
your furnishing the C.I.A. (Attention: Mr. Richard
HELMS) copies of the following reports:

"All correspondence carried on by Lee Harvey
OSWALD with persons in the Soviet Union, in particular,
the letters referred to on page 63 of your Supplemental
Report on the Assassination of President Kennedy.

"As additional materials in these general areas
are developed by the Bureau in thé course of its in-
vestigation, we would like the reports to be furnished
to the Central Intelligence Agency... . . "

relating to information developed by your Agency on
Lee Harvey OSWALD activity in Mexico City during
the period of September 28 to October 3, 1963.

"I assume - and would like to be so advised

an investigation is currently being pursued with
Tespect to an allegation of some significance
which emanated from the White House and which is
not referred to in the above-mentioned report.
With respect to this allegation, it would be
greatly appreciated if you would furnish us with

Memorandum for the Record, dated 12 March 1964;
Subject: Meeting with the Warren Commission on 12 March

1964.

"On 12 March 1964, Mr. HELMS, Mr. MURPHY, and
Mr. ROCCA met with Mr. RANKIN, Chief Counsel for the
Warren Commission, Mr. WILLEMS, and other members of
Mr. RANKIN's staff. The purpose of this meeting was
to discuss the current status of the CIA contribu-
tion to the work of the Warren Commission.


SEDIET
"2. The first topic raised by Mr. RANKIN
concerned information on Lee Harvey OSWALD's
stay in the Soviet Union as reported by the FBI,
based on their interview of the defector, Yuriy
Ivanovich NOSENKO. This discussion is reported
in a separate memorandum.

"3... . Mr. RANKIN's staff showed us a
detailed memorandum they had prepared based on all
of the information available to them, including
our own contribution concerning OSWALD's stay in
the USSR. . ..

"4, Members of Mr. RANKIN's staff then spoke
about having found a book in OSWALD's possessions
which had certain letters cut out giving the impre-
ssion that this might have formed the base or key
for a cipher system. ...

"S. Members of Mr. RANKIN's staff then com-
mented on the testimony of Mrs. OSWALD to the effect
that the letters from her son regarding his desire
to return to the United States had the appearance
of being dictated since they contained none of his
usual grammatical errors and used legal language
with which he would not have been familiar... .

"6. Mr. WILLEMS noted that Mrs. OSWALD had
introduced a statement to the effect that she sus-
pected her.son to be a CIA agent. ...

"7. A considerable part of the meeting from
this point forward consisted of a review by Mr.
RANKIN and his staff 6f the gaps in their investi-
gation to date. ...

"8. In connection with the Mexican phase of
the investigation, members of Mr. RANKIN's staff
questioned Mr. HELMS and Mr. ROCCA regarding the
extent of the CIA file on OSWALD for the period
8 October to 22 November 1963. .. .

"9, The question of why no action was taken
by other agencies of the government after their
receipt of CIA information that OSWALD was in
contact with the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in
Mexico City was next discussed. .. .

"10. Thé Commission, Mr. RANKIN said, would
be interested in any information held by CIA on
Jack RUBY. ...

"11. Mr. HELMS was then asked if CIA had done
any follow up to its original telegraphic dissemi-
nation of the information on OSWALD's visits to the
Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City. Mr. HELMS
replied that there had been no CIA action following
our initial dissemination. Mr. WILLEMS then asked
if there were any liaison problems faced by CIA in
its efforts to deal with other agencies in matters
affecting internal security. . . .

"12. Mr. WILLEMS then asked if CIA's intelli-
gence collection system was automated. .. .

"13. In speaking of the broader question of
protection for the President, Mr. RANKIN asked
about our procedures for working with the Secret
Service when the President travels abroad. ...

"14, Mr. WILLEMS asked if we could check on a

regarding one of the pictures identified by Mrs.
OSWALD as that of Jack RUBY... ."

Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,
dated 16 March 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel

“During our conference of March 12, we discussed
informally several questions. concerning Presidential
protection, which I would like to put informally to
obtain any comments your Agency may desire to make.

“First, at the time of the assassination, did
the Central Intelligence Agency have any written
description of the criteria to be employed by its
personnel in determining what information coming to
their attention should be furnished to the Secret
Service? If not in a written form, was there any
general policy with respect. to this matter?

"Second, has the Central Intelligence Agency any
recommendations to make regarding possible improve-
ments in any aspect of Presidential protection,
whether or not involving matters within its jurisdic-
tion, including intelligence arrangements and proce-
dures, liaison somg federal agencies, particular
protection measures, and any other aspect which. ap-
pears relevant?"

Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,
dated 16 March 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel.

"I would like to confirm our understanding of the
arrangements agreed upon at our conference on March
12, respecting the furnishing to the Commission of
certain materials to complete your response to the re-
quest of our letter of February 1964.

"As we understand it, you will supply a paraphrase
of each report or communication described in the second
paragraph og our letter of February 12, 164, with all
indications of your cinfidential communications tech-
niques and confidential sources deleted. You will also
afford members of our staff working in this area an
opportunity to review the actual files so that they may
give assurance that the paraphrases are complete.

"The same procedure would be followed with respect
to any materials described in the third paragraph of
our letter of February 12, 1964, which have not hither-
to been furnished because of similar security conside-
rations... In addition, we will be furnished actual
copies of disseminations on October, 10, 1963 to other
federal agencies regarding information ori OSWALD's ac-
tivities ‘in Mexico City, and any other materials not
already furnished and within the scope of the third
paragraph of our letter, which do not present security
problems requiring paraphrasing. ° ‘

“if these arrangements are satis factory to you,
I would appreciate your advising Howard P. WILLENS or
Samuel A. STERN fo our staff when it would be conven-
ient to have them visit your Agency to review the
files involved."

2 April 1964 :

Memorandum for the Record, dated 2 April 1964, by
Raymond G. ROCCA, Chief, CI/R4A; Subject: Meeting with
" Representative’ of the President's Conmiséion on the
Assassination of President Kennedy, 27 March 1964,
Langley.

"1, I talked with Mr. Samuel A. STERN re-
garding the Commission's interest in original
Agency materials on Friday, 27 March 1964, from
2:30 to 4:00. ...

"2. Mr. STERN hewed closely to the guidelines
which had been established between Mr. HELMS and Mr.
RANKIN: he read - or asked to read - only papers
that had a bearing on the summarized information
that had Already beeh forwarded to the Commission.
In the course of the discussion, he viewed the
following specific items of original Agency docu-
mentation:

"a. DIR-74673 dated 18 October 1963
to State, FBI, and Navy reporting ‘contact
w with Soviet Embassy, Mexico, hy American,
Lee OSWALD. (Forwarded to Commission
under cover of DDP memo, No. 4-1554, dated
24-March 1964.)

"b. “MEXI-7019 (IN-66846) dated 22
November 1963 re photos of unidentified
American entering Cuban Embassy on 15
October 1963. (To Commission under cover
of rey memo, No. 4-155S, dated 24 March |

64.

"c. MEXI-7020 (IN-66891) dated 23
November 1963 which forwarded names of
three persons possibly identical with
OSWALD who flew.from Mexico to U. S. in
November 1963. (To Commission under cover
of DDP memo, No. 4-1555, dated 24 March 1964.)

"d. MEXI-7021 (IN-66896) dated 23
November 1963 indicating that FBI agent hand-
carrying photos of person suspected of being
OSWALD to Dallas for mailing to D. C. (To
Commission under cover of DDP memo, No.

"e. Six photos mailed to Washington,
referred to in paragraph 2.d. above. (There
was no discussion as to how the photos were
acquired.)

"£. Copies of the three informal, un-
dated disseminations handcarried to the
Secret Service based on 2.b., c, and d above.

"g. DIR-84915 dated 23 November 1963
to the FBI re activities of North Ameritan,
possibly identical with OSWALD, who visited
Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico on 28
September 1963. (To Commission under cover

of DDP memo dated 31 January 1964, p. 8.)

"h. Originals of the thirty documents
from CIA's dossier on OSWALD which were for-
wardéd to the Commission under cover of DDP
memo, No. 4-1224, dated 6 March 1964. (See
attachment to that memo for inventory of
documents.)

. Machine run sheets on documents
accessioned to CIA's dossier on OSWALD.

"3, Mr. STERN stated he had a keen interest in
Agency programs for electronic data handling of in-
formation. I pointed out to him the up-dated machine
control record on the contents of the OSWALD file,
and suggested that I was sure that Mr. HELMS would
be pleased to offer him and others in the Commission
the possibility of viewing the Agency's data pro-
cessing mechanisms. It was also noted that a consi-
derable effort had already been made by Mr. HELMS'
subordinates to interest members of the intelligence
community in an interagency approach to the machine
control of counterintelligence and security informa-
tion. A presentation had been made before the ICIS

-on this matter and an article had been prepared for

Studies.in Intelligence. I promised to make a copy
of the article avalTapte to Mr. STERN.

"4. Mr. STERN was eager to view our actual
meghanisms for machine control of our. information:
and readily accepted the suggestion that a briefing
take place. It was indicated to him that he would
becontacted by CI Staff's Machine Records Officer

who would arrange the details for the presentation
in the near future.

"S. Mr. STERN volunteered oneepoint in the dis-
cussion that the Agency handling of the information
in the OSWALD case was unique among what the Commis-
sion had found had happened in every other agency.
He was critical of the Navy. He raised specifically
the question: why had the Navy not forwarded the
photograph of Lee Harvey OSWALD requested by the
Agency? He added that there were six or seven other
points on which the Navy had been gigged by the Com-
mission and there would be discussion between him and
the Navy in the near future. He stated flatly that
no Federal component except CIA had been able to show
the Commission hard documentation whéch indicated
there had been immediate action on field reported
information by headquarters and full instructions for
follow-up. Mr. STERN tended to equate this perfor-
mance to the way we handled our data and for that

. reason placed great emphasis upon what the Commissi:u
might be able to do in its report for an improved
methodology based on machines among departments and
agencies involved in security matters."

Memorandum for Deputy Director for Plans, dated 13
April 1964, by David E. MURPHY, Chief, SR Division; Subject:
'
* Discussioris with Mr. Allen W. DULLES on the OSWALD Case.

"1. At the instruction$ of the DDP, I visited Mr.
DULLES on 11 April to discuss with him certain ques-~
tions which Mr. DULLES feels the Warren Commission may
pose to,CIA. Mr. DULLES explained that while the Com-
mission wished to clarify certain aspects of the OSWALD
case in which a response from CIA seemed necessary it

SEGRT


~9-

was not sure how en dEaDET sons should be posed
nor how CIA should respond. Mr. DULLES hoped
that our discussions would enable him to advise
the Commission on this matter. He first raised
the allegation that OSWALD was a CIA agent. He
mentioned two sources for this accusation. One
was Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD, Lee Harvey OSWALD's
mother, and the other was Mr. Mark LANE, Mrs.
OSWALD's attorney. ...

"2. Mr. DULLES then suggested that the res-
ponse to this question could be in the form of
sworn testimony before the Commission by a senior
CIA official or a letter or affidavit. He re-
called that the Director of the FBI had replied
by letter to a similar question. In any event,
Mr. DULLES felt that the reply should be straight-
forward and to the point. He thought language
which made it clear that Lee Harvey OSWALD was
never an employee or agent of CIA would suffice.
We should also state that neither CIA nor anyone
acting on CIA's behalf was ever in contact or
communicated with OSWALD. .. . I agreed with
him that a carefully phrased denial of the charges
of involvement ¥th OSWALD seemed most appropriate.

"3. The next question concerned the possi-
bility of OSWALD's having been a Soviet agent. Mr.
DULLES suggested that the Commission's question on
this matter be phrased somewhat as follows: 'In
the knowledge or judgement of CIA was Lee Harvey
OSWALD an agent of the Soviet intelligence services
of the intelligence services of other communist
states at-any time prior to.22 November 1963, or
was OSWALD solicited by these intelligence services
to become such an agent?' ... Mr. DULLES and J
felt that it would be better to . . . confine our
response to a precise statement of fact. This state-
ment, in Mr. DULLES' view, could note that CIA |
possessed no knowledge either gained independently
or from its study of the materials supplied by the
Commission tending to show that Lee Harvey OSWALD
was an agent of the Soviet intelligence services,
or the services of any other communist country, or
for that matter of any other country.

"A, ee

"S. . . . Mr. DULLES mentioned other issues
which concerned the Commission. He remarked that
members of the Commission could not understand why
cia had not begun an investigation of OSWALD as
soon as it received word that he had defected. I
noted that this question had been discussed with
Mr. RANKIN and his staff and there seemed to be
considerable [mis]Junderstanding of the practical
circumstances which made it impossible for CIA to
undertake such investigation inside the USSR. I
expressed the hope that it would not be necessary
for CIAto place matters of this sort in the public
recotd. Mr. DULLES agreed.

"6. Mr. DULLES then asked if it were normal for
the Soviet Government to permit a Soviet woman to
marry a foreigner and then allow her to leave with
her husband shortly after the marriage. This question
perturbed |the Commission and they would like to have
an answer. I said that . . . the problem seemed to
lie more in the consular field and I suggested that
the best way to obtain an opinion on what constituted
"normal practice’ in marriage cases in the USSR would

SECRET


- 10 -

be to question the SECRET. of State. Mr. DULLES
agreed.

"7... . I did offer a personal opinion in
regard.to the way in which CIA should respond. Noting
that testimony on questions such as these would be
difficult to insert in the public record, I suggested
that it would be best if the CIA response were in writ-
ten form. However, much will depend on the form in
which the questions are eventually put to us and I
imagine that a final decision can be made at that time.

21 April 1964 :

Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,
dated 21 April 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel.

"On behalf of the Commission I would like to thank
you and your representatives for the fine cooperation
which was extended to representatives of the Commission
during the course of their work in Mexico City from
April 8 through April 13, 1964. ...

"During their stay in Mexico City the Commission
representatives discussed with Mr. SCOTT and agents
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that portion
of the Lee Harvey OSWALD investigation which: ‘con=.:
cerned Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte. .. .

"Upon review of our complete file on this matter,
we find that we lack full documentation of the inves-
tigation conducted of these allegations. It would be
helpful if our records could be supplemented by a re-
port from your Agency supplying more details regard-
ing the investigation undertaken by your Agency and
other concerned agencies into this matter and your
evaluation as to the truth of ALVARADO's assertions.
In particular, it would be helpful if a report could
be submitted by the expert wgo conducted the. poly-

clusions which he made based on the responses by
ALVARADO in answering key questions on this matter."

Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,

dated 24 April 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel.

"As an aid to testing the reliability of infor-
mation we possess on Lee Harvey OSWALD's dealings
with the Cuban.and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City
in late September and early October of 1963, the
Commission would like to have as much information
as can be obtained regarding the hours at which
these two embassies are open to the public, their
normal working hours for other purposes, and the
procedures and regulations, whether formal or in-
formal, involved in issuing Cuban visas or other
permits to travel to or through Cuba. In addition,
we would like to have a description of the proce-
dures and regulations enforced by the Mexican au-
thorities, whether formal or informal, in connec-
tion with travel by Americans to and from Cuba
through Mexico.

"We are advised by the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation, from which agency representatives of the
Commission requested this ififormation in Mexico
City, that your agency is in a better position to
respond to this request."

Meeting with Mr. SLAWSON of the Presidential Commission.

"1. On 5 May, Mr. (WHITTEN) and Mr 2gHALL met win
Mr. SLAWSON of the Commission in Mr.(WHITTEN)s office
This meeting had been requested to ask for a’ fresh
translation of the taped conversation between Cuban
President BORTICOS and Ambassador ARMAS (sic - HERNAN-
DEZ Armas}. Win SCOTT had told the Commission staff
visiting Mexico City that his translators, in the
rush at that time, might have misconstrued certain
nuances of meaning in what was a difficult recording:
In view of this, Mr. SLAWSON asked that a new trans-
Tation be made, if possible, by a person knowledgeable
of the Cuban dialect.

"2. According to Mr. SLAWSON, only Messrs.
RANKIN, WILLENS, COLEMAN, and he presently know of
the telephone taps in Mexico City. SLAWSON, WILLENS ,
and COLEMAN were briefed on the taps during their
visit to Mexico City.

"3, In about three weeks the staff will begin
presenting to the Commission evidence on the conspira-
torial aspect of the assassination. At this time,
apparently, their evidence is against the existence
of a plot. They will wish to present to the Commission
the ARMAS-DORTICOS conversation. SLAWSON suggested
the possibility that a knowledgeable CIA man could
make this presentation, interpreting the conversation
in the light of our study.

"4. Mr, WHITTEN)said that wé will again itranslate
the tape, using the best available Cuban linquist, and
once again study the nuances of the conversation. Any
presencation to the Commission, however, would have to

"At a meeting on March 12, 1964, between
representatives of your Agency and this Commission,
a memorandum prepared by members of the Commission
staff was handed to you which related to the back-
ground of Jack L. RUBY and alleged associates and/
or activities in Cuba. At that time we requested
that you: review this memorandum and submit to the
Commission any information contained in your files
regarding the matters covered in the memorandum, as
well as any other analyses by your representatives
which you believed might be useful to the Commission.

"As you know, this Commission is nearing the
end of its investigation. We would appreciate
hearing from you as soon as possible whether you
are in a position to comply with this request in
the near future."

"The Commission wishes to consider the possibility
that during his stay in the Soviet Union Lee Harvey
OSWALD may have received medical or psychological
treatment or conditioning designed to reinforce or ac-
centuate his apparent hostility to authority and
thereby render him a disruptive factor in this country
after his return,

"We think that a study of the latest Soviet tech-
niques in 'mind conditioning' and so-called 'brain-
washing' would be helpful in that regard. We would
greatly appreciate your making such materials as you
may have on that subjeet available to Mr. Wesley J.
LIEBELER of our staff. Perhaps a conference'on this
subject between appropriate members of your organiza-
tion and members of our staff would be desirable."

Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,
25 May 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel.

"In connection with some discussions recently
had with Mr. Abram CHAYES, the Legal Adviser to the
Department of State, Mr. CHAYES has informed the
Commission that members of the Department of State
have informed him that at the time Lee Harvey OSWALD
received his tourist visa to enter Russia from the
Soviet Embassy at Helsinki, Finland, at least a week
ordinarily transpired between the time when the tou-
rist applied for his visa and the issuance of that
visa. If this is true, then the fact that Lee
Harvey OSWALD obtained his tourist visa in from two
to four days may have some significance.

"From material previously supplied to the,
Commission by the Central Intelligence. Agency we
have concluded that OSWALD arrived in Helsinki on
an airplane from London on October 10, 1959, that
his Soviet tourist visa was issued from the Embassy
in Helsinki on October 14, and that he departed for
Moscow on a train on October 15. Assuming that he
applied for a visa the same day he arrived in Hel-
sinki, four days were required for him to obatin
the visa. If, however, his airplane arrived too
late on October 10 for him to reach the Soviet
Embassy and apply for a visa that same day, he
probably would have had to wait until Monday, Octo-
ber 12, to tender his application. We have no in-
formation on the probable time of ktrival of his
flight or the closing time of the Embassy, so we
cannot estimate whether he had sufficient time to
get from the airport to the Embassy before it
closed on Saturday, October 10.

"We have already asked that the Department of
State look further into this matter and give us its
best opinion regarding the average time required to
obtain a Soviet tourist visa from Helsinki in October
1959 and also the regularity or lack of regularity
evidenced by the soviet Embassy in this regard. We
are of course interested in the question of the re-
gularity of procedures because we want to know whether,
if OSWALD did in fact obtain his visa more quickly
than was: normal, his doing so was significant, or
whether it may have been only the result of a not-
infrequent deviation from normal procedures.

"If it is still possible at this time to deter-
mine the approximate hour on October 10, 1959 when
OSWALD's flight arrived ‘in Helsinski and the hour
when the Soviet Embassy closed, this information,
plus an estimate of the time required to travel from
the airport to the Embassy by commercial transporta-
tion, would also be of assistance to the Commission."

"1. Pursuant to the Director's suggestion,
I called on Chief Justice WARREN at 11:30 in the
office of the President's Commission. I presen-
ted him the letter which I had drafted for the
Director's signature. Chief Justice WARREN read
the letter carefully, after which I gave him
some highly classified details about the NOSENKO
case and why we were unwilling to vouch for him
as a bona fide defector. The Chief Justice that
he and Congressman FORD had already expressed
reservations about the use of the NOSENKO material
in the Commission's published report, although
other members of the Commission desired to use it
in some form or other. He concluded his remarks
by saying that based on the Director's letter and
my observations he would see to it that the
NOSENKO information was not used. He asked per-
mission to show the Director's letter to the other
members of the Commission, to which I replied that
he could usé the letter in any way that would be

CRE
Commission Report. I told Mr. DULLES that this
concern was understandable but that we felt the best
course by far would be to omit any reference to the
NOSENKO information in the final report. While it
is conceivable that NOSENKO might someday be in a
position to claim that he provided information on
the KENNEDY assassination, I said that the differ-
ence between NOSENKO's situation and that of other
bona fide defectors was such that it would be less

would be for them to indicate that doubt existed
regarding the source of the information. We would
be opposed to this because it would signal to NOSENKO's
principals something of how we viewed this case and
could also bring about renewed press and public in-
terest in NOSENKO.

"2. Mr. DULLES.and I then exchanged views on
the possibility of finding language which wold al-
lude to the existence of otherm unverified informa-
tion on the OSWALD case. This language would per-
mit the Commission to say if challenged in the future
on this issue that it had taken the NOSENKO informa-
tion into consideration in the final report but at
the same time it would not be presented in a manner
which would be at variance with the important opera-
tional considerations we have raised.

"3. “It was agreed that an effort might be made
to find such language if Mr. DULLES is again unsuc-
cessful in persuading his colleages to eliminate any
reference to the NOSENKO information from the report.
To attempt this, however, we would have to know pre-
cisely in what context the Commission intended to
make use of the NOSENKO information. This, Mr. DULLES
will have to determine from Mr. RANKIN. .. .

Memorandum for the Record, dated 9 July 1964; subject:

Discussion with Warren Commission Staff Member; signed by
Lee H. WIGREN, C/SR/CI/Research.

"1. With the approval of C/SR and the DDP, I met
with Mr. W. David SLAWSON of the staff... . The ,
purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent incon:
sistencies in material provided the Commission by CIA
and by_the Department of State which were called to
our attention in a letter from the General Counsel of
the Commission to Mr. HELMS, dated 3 July 1964,

"2. By way of introduction, Mr. SLAWSON said that
in the portion of the Commission's report that he was
writing, he would have to deal with the question of
whether or not the OSWALDs' departure from the USSR -
and the circumstances (i.e..timing) of that departure -
were unusual or suspicious in any way. He expressed
his belief that they probably were not and cited
Soviet relaxation in such matters in the post-Stalin
era. However, he wanted to be sure in his own mind


Sika
o

.
that our information was not in conflict with that
which the Commission had received from State since
all of that information would remain in the records
of the Commission.

"3, After stating my belief that there was no
real disagreement or inconsistency between the infor-
mation from CIA and that from State, I expressed the
view that the matter resolved itself into three
questions:

“a. Do the Soviet authorities normally
permit Soviet citizens married to foreign
nationals to emigrate from the Soviet Union
to the homelands of their spouses?

"b. Do they normally permit such Soviet
citizens to accompany (i.e. depart simultane-
ously with) their spouses from the Soviet
Union?

"c. How long does it take such Soviet

citizens to get Soviet exit visas for such a

purpose (time lapse from application to gran-

_ ting of visds)? ;

"4, Concerning the first two questions (3a and
3b above) I pointed out that we had addressed our-
selves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens
being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while
State dealt valy with the larger question of Soviets
married to foreigners being allowed to emigrate with-
out reference to whether or not they left simultane-
ously with or at another time from their spouses.

Mr. SLAWSON commented that this explanation was most
helpful and he reread what both we and State had said
in that light.

"S. By way of further explanation, { said that
the statements in paragraph 6 of our memorandum of
6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being permitted to
accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on
a review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans.
In only ‘four of these cases did a Soviet wife leave
the USSR in the company of her foreign husband; in
14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone;
and in the remaining seven cases insufficient details
are known to permit us to categorize them. I added
that although State's information began by citing
the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant
visas by the American Embassy in Moscow during the
period FY 1954 to December 1963, it did not indicate
how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens who
had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided
detailed information for only sixteen cases and did
not indicate in many of these whether or not the
Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.

"6. In response to a question from Mr. SLAWSON
I stated that most of the 26 cases upon which we based
our statements involved foreign students, exchange
teachers and other relatively transient persons, and
while & number of cases have certain points in common,
they bear little similarity to the OSWALD case in that
none involved a defector who married prior to repatri-
ating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 Apri} 1964
memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out.
Mr. SLAWSON indicated he was now satisfied on this
matter.

"7. Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet

authorities to process visas for Soviet citizens married

to foreign nationals (question 3c above), I stated
that, in my opinion, the information provided by
State (in the third enclosure to Mr. MEEKER's
letter) substantially corresponded to the views ex-
pressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of our memorandum to
the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. SLAWSON
asked if it would be possible to elaborate para-
graph 7 of our memorandum of 6 April by providing a =
Statistical breakdown of the cases on which our
poraerones were based. I indicated that this could
e done.

"8, At this point Mr. SLAWSON stated that as a
result of our discussion he felt that the question of
possible inconsistencies had been resolved. However,
he asked that we send a brief written reply to the
Commission's letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the sub-
stance of what I had said concerning the basis for
Statements included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum.

Memorandum of Conversation, dated 17 July 1964;

subject: Use of NOSENKO Information in Warren Commission

Report. [Participants in meeting held on 16 July 1964:

J. Lee JRANKIN, General Counsel of the Commission, Mr.

SLAWSON, Mr. Tennent H. BAGLEY, and Mr. Lee WIGREN.]

"1. At mr. HELMS' request we discussed with
Mr. SLAWSON and Mr. RANKIN how and in what manner
NOSENKO's information might be used in the published
report of the Warren Commission. Mr. HELMS had dis-
cussed this problem with Mr. DULLES and Mr. RANKIN
and Mr. MURPHY had also discussed it with Mr. DULLES
(the latter conversation was reported in a memoran-
dum of 8 July 1964). Mr. HELMS' instructions to me
were to discuss the matter cooperatively but to
leave all decisions to Mr. HELMS.

"2. Mr. SLAWSON, with whom we spoke alone for
the first 20 minutes, had drafted a memorandum to
Mr. RANKIN proposing a text embodying NOSENKO's in-
formation for the Commission's report. He invited
us to read and comment on it. ...

"3. After reading Mr. SLAWSON's proposed text,
I told him that CIA wanted to assist the Warren Com-
mission in any way possible. For a number of reasons
the proposed text could be damaging to the interests
of the-Commission:

"a. Regardless of the wording of the
source description, it was very likely that
the press would very quickly be able to i-
dentify the 'confidential Soviet Union Source!
as NOSENKO. (Neither Mr. SLAWSON nor, later,

’ Mr. RANKIN disagreed with this.)

"b. NOSENKO is very likely to be uncovered

publicly as a KGB plant at some time in the future

When this occurs unsophisticated readers of the



--19

SECRET

Commission's report will be inclined to read
his statements through a mirror and to assume
that the reverse of what he said was true;
i.e., that OSWALD was a KGB agent, perhaps
dispatched on a mission to kill President
Kennedy.

"ce. The inclusion of NOSENKO's informa-
tion, followed by the later revelation that he
was a Soviet plant, would cast a shadow over the
reliability of the report and the judgement of
the Commission.

"d. Revelation that NOSENKO had any speci-
fic knowledge of OSWALD's case in the Soviet
Union would be seized upon by an alert press as
the most intriguing new item in the whole report.
It would make NOSENKO into a public figure again
and would raise demands for public appearances
and testimonies. This would have catastrophic
results on our current plans to get to the bottom
of the NOSENKO affair and, among other things,
would lessen our chances of eventually learning
the true story behind his OSWALD information. If
we do, we might be able in this way to contribute
significantly to the work of the Commission.

"4, Mr. SLAWSON immediately and without further /
discussion said that he was convinced of the validity
of our arguments. .. .

"5. Mr. RANKIN was convinced that whethér or not
NOSENKO's name or information were included in the re-
port, the press representatives would specifically ask
Commission spokesmen whether or not NOSENKO, the well-
publicized KGB defector, had been asked for his know-
ledge of the affair. The Commission did not want to
be in the position of having overlooked this source
nor of having withheld matters relevant to the inves-
tigation. However, since NOSENKO appears to be a
KGB plant, it did not appear necessary or desirable to
use his information in full and Mr. RANKIN agreed that
there would be a public tendency to mirror-read NOSENKO's
statements after he was revealed to be a KGB plant.

"6. At this point we all agreed that some language
could be found which would protect the Commission from
later accusations of having used planted information
or of witholding testimony. CIA's aim was to avoid
NOSENKO's becoming a public figure or mystery or center
of attention. We wnated if possible to slide through
the publication of the Warren Commission report with
our handling of NOSENKO. as untroubled as possible,
Since Mr. RANKIN seemed rather certain that the press
would ask whether NOSENKO had been consulted, even if
his name did not appear: in the report, it might very
well be in CIA's interest, as well as the Commission's,
to have NOSENKO's name mentioned in the report. (in a
manner which would discourage further questions). Mr.
RANKIN_was inclined to say, at one point, something to
the effect that the Commission received information
from various confidential sources, without specifying
what information or which sources were involved, which
information 'did not affect the Commission's conclusions’.
We also discussed the possibility of drafting a state-
ment to be used by Commission members should they be
questioned by the press.

"7, It was agreed that Mr. RANKIN and Mr. SLAWSON
would work out some phraseology which would meet our
needs and that they discuss this wording with CIA,
perhaps with Mr. HELMS present... .

Memorandum of Conversation, dated 28 July 1964;
subject: Use of NOSENKO Information in Warren Commission
Report. [Participants in a meeting on 27 July 1964:

Mr. Allen W. DULLES, Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, and Mr. David
SLAWSON of thé Warren Commission; Mr. Richard HELMS, Mr.
David E. MURPHY, and Mr. Tennent H. BAGLEY of CIA.)

"1, This discussion, following earlier ones on
the same subject, was called by Mr. RANKIN to discuss
proposed drafts for inclusion or non-incluéion of
NOSENKO's information in the report of the Commission.
Mr. SLAWSON had prepared a short memorandum with three
attachments, offering alternative drafts. A copy of
Me. SLAWSON's memo, which was an informal one and not
for permanent Commission records, is attached.

"2, Of these drafts, one (#2) names NOSENKO, ad-
mits he had direct knowledge of OSWALD's case in the
USSR and comments that his reliability is uncertain.
Another (#3, parts 1 and 2) includes information from
NOSENKO about OSWALD which would be included in the
report; NOSENKO is not named as the course. A third
(#4) is for inclusion in the Commission report if no
NOSENKO information is used, explianing why certain
information was not included in order to protect the
Commission from later charges of having failed to
use NOSENKO's information.

"3. The CIA representatives thought that it woutd
be undesirable to include any NOSENKO information in
the report, and after some discussion, there was
general agreement on this view. The circumstances which
contributed to this conclusion are summarized here:

“a. NOSENKO is a KGB pland and may be pub-
licly exposed as such some time after the ap-
pearance of the Commission's report. CIA can-
not at this time, however, evaluate the accuracy
of what NOSENKO has reported on the OSWALD case,
nor the significance of his having reporting it.

ro

“b. Even without public discrediting of the
source, specific aspects of NOSENKO's information
are likely. to. lead to questions and doubts on the
part of perceptive readers.

"ce. Once NOSENKO is exposed as a KGB plant,
there will arise the danger that his information
will be mirror-read by the press and public,
leading to conclusions that the USSR did direct
the assassination.

—~ "d. The Agency's greatest contribution to
the resolution of the questions at hand would be
to break NOSENKO and get the full story of how -c
and why he was told to tell the story he did
about OSWALD. While we have no certainty that
we can ever do this, if.we are to succeed we need
time and must in the meantime avoird creating
* pressures which might force us to release NOSENKO
to the public domain. . (There, articulate and
plausible, he would unqestionably be able to es-
tablish himself beyond hope of dislodging, since
his story cannot be easily be piereed even by
trained specialists, much less by private citizens



-21-

SECRET

however intelligent.) The release of the fact
that NOSENKO knew specifically about the OSWALD
case would, of course, create such pressure, and
no hedging on source description could protect
his identity.

"4. The Commission representatives, particularly
Mr. RANKIN, felt that some mention of NOSENKO might be
inevitable, at. least when after the publication of its
report, the press would ask the Commission about him
and whether he had had anything to contribute. Mr.
HELMS suggested that CIA could provide a number of
Soviet intelligence defectors to testify to the Com-
mission, and the Commission could then report that
‘defcetors', in general, and without naming NOSENKO,
had given information. It was agreed that the Agency
had already provided such defector information in its
previous reports, and that wording to this effect
could be worked into the Commission's draft #4, which
was otherwise quite suitable from the point of view
of the Agency and the Commission. At Mr. HELMS! sug-
gestion, it was agreed that CIA would undertake to
draft a few sentences to this effect.

"7. Mr. BAGLEY reported that, in response to the
Commission's request, we have tested, in the Soviet
Embassies in Stockholm and Helsinki, the time required
to get a Soviet tourist visa, and find that 2+3 ‘days
is impossible and five days the apparent minimum in
both places. In one, however, it was implied that
shortage of hotel space might be a contributing factor,
so these findings might not be valid for the month of
October, when OSWALD apparently got his visa in twe or
three days."

Letter to Mr. Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans,
dated 11 August 1964, from J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel.
. "The Department of State has very recently
informed the Commission that it has files which in-
Clude information about persons who were confined to

the Botkinkaya Hospital in Moscow during the Fall of
1959, the same period during which Lee Harvey OSWALD


ak
-R-

was, according to his Tel eoric Diary and informa-
tion supplied by the Russian Government, also con-
fined to that Hospital. W. David SLAWSON of the
Commission staff discussed with Mr. Raymond ROCCA
of your Agency on August 10, 1964, the possibility
of ‘the Agency's attempting to locate and question
Mr. Waldemar Boris KARA-PATNITZKY in West Berlin.
Mr. KARA-PATNITZKY, according to information fur-
nished by the Department of State, was admitted to
the Botkinkaya Hospital in late September, 1959,

is an American, and is now 75 years old. He, there-
fore, may very well be the 'elderly American’ OSWALD
referred to in his Historic Diary as having been
confined in the same ward with him.

"Mr. SLAWSON forwarded to Mr. ROCCA via hand
delivery on August 10, 1964, Mr. KARA-PATNITZKY's
passport file, obtained from the Department of
State, a Secret Service Memorandum to me dated
August 7, 1964 and carrying Secret Service no.

1964 by Special Agents Thomas and Wong and a copy
of a letter I wrote to the Secret Service describ-
ing the work we asked the Service to do in respect
to this problem in connection with two other per-
sons who might have related to it.

"Mr. ROCCA told Mr. SLAWSON the Central. Intelli-
gence Agency would proceed immediately to locate
Mr. KARA-PATNITZKY and carry out. whatever question=

subject: Report of the President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy.

"David SLAWSON, during a discussion on another
topic, mentioned that he was sending over this after-
noon or tomorrow (via Mr. RANKIN) an advance copy of
a draft of the portion of the Commission's report
on the foreign conspiratorial angle of the Kennedy
assassination. It would include a precise indication
of what attachments and quotations were going to be
used. . This would be for our reading and approval."

"Enclosed and marcked Attachment A is a.list of
documents supplied to the Commission by the Central
Intelligence Agency which the Commission contemplates
using as authority in the 'Possible Foreign Conspiracy’
section of its report. Unless otherwise indiéated, the
Commission contemplates publishing each such document
in its entirety. 3

"We would appreciate receiving a letter from you
approving. the publication of the documents on the at-
tached list. If you believe that some of these docu-
ments, or portions of them should not be published,
will you please provide me with an itemized list of
your objections, as a basis for discussion.

"The second page of attachment A also contains a
list of documents entitled ‘State Department Files’.
These are papers which were sent to the State Depart-
ment by the Central Intelligence Agency and turned
over to the Commission by the Department. The Com-
mission does not contemplate citing any of them in
its report. However, unless the Central Intelligence
Agency objects, the Commission will leave them in the
State Department files, where they will presumably be
transferred to some depository, such as the National
Archives, and there made available for examination by
anyone with a legitimate interest in them. Copes of
each of these State Department documents have Been
Perera this letter to aid in your identification
of them.

"The Commission would appreciate the Central
Intelligence Agency, at its very earliest opportu-
nity, analyzing and testing these documents to as-
certain their authenticity and for any other pur-
pose it deems appropriate. In particular, but not
intended as a limitation, we would appreciate your
attempts to ascertain whether the signature ‘Lee
H. OSWALD' is in the handwriting of Lee Harvey
OSWALD, and whether the notation at the bottom of
the application, 'Hotel del Commercio, Room 18-46-50-

other appropriate person employed in the Cuban Em-
bassy in Mexico City at the time OSWALD was there.

"The Commission would appreciate receiving
memoranda from the Central Intelligence Agency
which can be published and cited as authority for
the following proposttions:

"(1)_ It is not unusual for a Latin
American to,exaggerate the lightness of a
North American's skin or jair color. (This
is in reference to Silvia DURAN's identifica-
tion of OSWALD as 'blond'.)

"(2) The Hotel Berlin and the Hotel
Metropole were both under the same admini-
stration and both are closely watched by the
KGB. “

(3) The 'Passport and Visa Office’
which Rimma SHIRAKOVA told Lee Harvey OSWALD
had been notified of his desire to become a
citizen of the Soviet Union, is probably

the Visa and Registration Department “of. the
Ministry of Internal Affairs.

(4) There have been allegations that
Syliva DURAN and her husband, Horacio DURAN
Navarro, are members of the Communist Party.

"(5) The usual Soviet procedure is to
send defectors who have carried out their
defection in Moscow to some place in the
Sovoet Union other than Moscow reasonably
soon after it has been determined toaaccept
the defector. (In establishing how long Lee
Harvey OSWALD probably waited to be accepted
by the Soviet Union for residence there, the
Commission would like to have authority for
relying upon the fact that so long as OSWALD
|was in Moscow staying in a room at the Metro-
pole Hotel, he probably had not yet been ac-
cepted for residence in the Soviet Union.)"

SILVIA TIRADO BOZAN DE DURAN

Personal information taken from her interrogations on 23 and

28 November 1963:

"Silvia Tirado de DURAN stated she is Mexican
by birth, 26 years old, married, no religion, employed,
address in Dept. 3, house no. 143 Constituyentes, Mexi-
co City; that she has been-married to Horacio DURAN
Navarro since $ November 1958 and that they have a
daughter named Patricia three and one-half years old;
that in July or August of 1961, she was offered em-
ployment as coordinator at the Mexican-Cuban Institute
of Cultural Relations, then headed by Lic. Augustin
Cue CANOVAS. That since that time she had frequently
visited officers of the Cuban Embassy, having personal
friendship with Ambassador PORTUONDO, the cultural
attaches Teresa PROENZA and Luis ALVERU as well as
with other employees. Her contacts were principally
with Maricarmen OLAVARRI, Secretary to Consul Eusebio
AZCUE, a Spaniard and relative of AZCUB, and who re-
ceived 500 pesos monthly.

"In December 1961 she and her husband made a trip
to Havana by plane. They paid for their own tickets,
but all other expenses of their visit to all the is-
lands were paid by the Cuban Institute of Freindship
with the Peoples (Instituto Cubano de Amistad con los
Pueblos - ICAP) and the Cultural House.

"She sympathized with the Cuban movement since its
beginning; that she was a coordinator of the Mexican-
Cuban Institute of Cultural Relations since July or
August 1961 and that she studied for the career of an
English-Spanish secretary at the Escuela Bancaria.
She mastered English, knows some French, and i3 study-
ing philosophy. She has a leftist ideolosy, by con-
viction, and is in accord with communism, but does not
belong to any political group nor has she participated
in meetings or acts of this nature. That officers of
the Cuban Embassy, including the Consul, have been in
her home; that she knows almost all the principal lef-
tists in Mexico without being a friend of them; that
except for one visit to Brownesville, Texas, she has
not been in the United States."

[Memorandum for Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, dated 21 February 1964,
from Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans; Subject:

Translations of Interrogation Reports of Silvia DURAN.]

"She said she knew Carlos LECHUGA Hevia who was
Cuban Ambassador in Mexico and who arrived here when
she was working as Coordinator in the Mexican-Cuban
Institute of Cultural Relations. She became friendly
with this person but she never did any personal work
for him. She ‘said that this Ambassador came to her
house to visit her on the occasion of a party which
she held. She considers him as a friend and she saw
him frequently

"She said that while she was'working in the afore-
mentioned Institute, and before working as a secretary
in the Consulate she went to the Cuban Embassy to help
Teresa PROENZA. The help she rendered there consisted
of answering the telephones and doing secondary tasks.

SECRET


oo

SECRET

The Cultural Attache PROENZA never assigned her any
work outside the Embassy. She said that she had

know PROENZA before she had been coordinator for the
Institute since she was a good friend of Paul FLORES
Guerrero, the husband of DURAN's sister-in-law, who
died about three and a half years ago. It was through
FLORES that DURAN met PROENZA.

"She stated that she has had her present ideology
for about five years, and that it is based on convic-
tion and studies. She said she had not belonged nor
does she belong to any student groups.

"DURAN indicated she was acquainted with the
Leninist Spactacus League (Liga Leninista Espartaco)
but that she is not in agreement with it, and that her
husband shares her opinion. They admire Jose REVUELTAS
as a writer but not as a politician since they are in
disagreement with his book entitled "The Headless Pro-
letariat" (Proletariado sin Cabeza) in which he tries
to prove the inexistence of the Mexican Communist Party
(Partido Communista Mexicano, PCM) while it is obvious
that this party does indeed exist, although it is dis-
organized. She said that she had not belonged to this
organization but that she is friendly with its leaders
such as Jose REVUELTAS and the two LIZALDES.

"She disclaimed membership in the PCM, and said
she had not tried to joon it because she was in disa-
greement with it except for its support of Cuba."

[Memorandum for Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, dated 21 February 1964,
from Richard HELMS, Deputy. Director for Plans; Subject:

Translations of Interrogation Reports of Silvia DURAN.]

At the time of her arrest on 23 November 1963,
DURAN had been employed by the Cuban Consulate in
Mexico City as a temporary replacement for Maricarmen
OLIVARRI upon the latter's death in July 1963. Mari-
carmen OLAVARRI had served as secretary to the Cuban
Consul Eusebio AZCUE, who left Mexico on 18 November
1963 after having been replaced by Alfredo MIRAVAL
Y DIAZ.

DURAN's duties included the preparation of visas
and the handling of visa applications which were for-
warded to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs for
approval.

[MEXI-7065 (IN 67737), 25 November 1963; FBI Report, dated
18 May 1964.]

Horacio DURAN Navarro - Mexican by birth; an industrial
designer, forty years old, and lives in Mexico City at
Constituyentes, Dept. 3. He lived the first eight

years of his life in Los Angeles, California; he then
lived in Chile for one and a half years before returning
to Meixco. He received a degree from the_Escuela Nacional

26 November 1962 : (Date of dissemination)

A usually reliable and sensitive source in Mexico
City reported that on 26 November 1962 Gladys LECHUGA,
wife of Carlos LECHUGA, Cuban Ambassador to the United
Nations, formerly Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, said that
she had received two letters from her husband in New York.
He asked for spparation and said that the person in whom
he is interested is Silvia T. de DURAN; that she is "of H
his ideas" and was willing to go to Cuba. According to
source, Teresa PROENZA, Cultural Attache at the Cuban Em-
bassy in Mexico City said that DURAN had never been a
Marxist or a communist.

Another usually reliable source with good contacts in
the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City reported in November 1962
that. LECHUGA and DURAN did have an affair. The Cuban Embassy
was aware of it, but efforts were made to keep-it. ‘from.be-
coming known.

Information from a source whose reliability could not
be judged reported that LECHUGA had offered to marry DURAN,
a Mexican married woman, after divorcing his wife, since she
(Silvia DURAN) was ready to accompany him to Cuba.

if the concession of a Soviet visa were assured.

At 1605 hours (Mexico time) on Friday, 27 September
1963, Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee
of the Cuban Embassy, Consular Section, a receptionist “[Sic]
speaks with an unknown male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia
DURAN tells the man that the American citizen was there,
the one who wants. a visa for Cuba on his way to the Soviet
Union, and he wants to know with whom he was talking there
because she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet Em-
bassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa,
then the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him a visa without
further paper work, only advising immigration in Cuba. The
American, she says, wants to know with whom he had talked
there because he says he was told there would be no problem.
The man in the Soviet Embassy says to wait a moment. A
different Soviet speaks, and Silvia DURAN explains the same
thing to him. This man says to leave a name and telephone
number and says he will call back. Silvia DURAN gives the
telephone number 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate). She also takes
advantage of the conversation and stated she haS moved and
wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of her change of address
so that she can receive the Soviet Embassy's bulletin. The

man Says to call KOUKHARENKO to give her new address, then

Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN received a con-
firmation from the Soviet Embassy that the American had been
to the USSR installation. He had shown them a letter from
the Soviet Consulate in Washington indicating that he had
been long awaiting a visa for himself and his wife to #o to
the USSR. No answer had come from Washington; however, the
waiting period was sometimes four or five months. The Ameri-
can also had a letter attesting that he was a member of a
pro-Cuban organization but he had claimed that the Cubans
would not give him a visa unless he had already received a
Russian visa.

Although the American was still at the Cuban Consulate,
Silvia DURAN repeated that she could not give him a transit
visa unless a Soviet visa was forthcoming, notwithstanding
the American's wish to go to Cuba to wait there for his So-
viet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one in
Cuba and she intended to annotate appropriately the American's
card. The Soviet official echoed her statement that the
American was not known.

At 1626 hours (Mexico time) on Friday, 27 September

sulate, asks Silvia DURAN if the American had been there.

Silvia DURAN says he is there now. The Soviet says the

American showed papers from the Consulate in Washington,
that he wants to go to the Soviet Union and be there for

a long time with his wife, who is Russian, but the answer
has not come from Washington in respect to this problem,
eadteccording to this procedure it takes four to five
months, but without permission from the Soviet Union they
should ask, or better said, they cannot issue a visa there
without asking Washington. However, according to this man,
he showed a letter indicating he was a member of an organi-
zation in favor of Cuba and that the Cubans said that they
cannot issue a visa without his having a visa for the Soviet
Union, and now he (the Soviet) does not know what to do with
him (the American), because they have to wait for an answer
from Washington.

Silvia DURAN agrees the same problem exists with the
Cubans, that the problem with him (the American) is that he
does not know anyone in Cuba and therefore if that is true
it will be difficult for him to get a visa for Cuba, be-
cause he was thinking of processing his visa (for the Soviet
Union), because he knew it would require waiting a long time
for his visa to the Soviet Union while in Cuba,. and from
there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet said the thing is
that if his wife right now were in Washington she would re-
ceive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet
Union, to return to her country, she is going to receive her
visa in Washington but having this visa, she could communicate
to any place this permission, for example here or any place
she could receive it (visa or permission), but right now they
‘do not have them. Silvia DURAN says certainly and they can-
not give a letter either because they do not know if the visa
will be approved. The Soviet says he cannot give a letter
or recommendation either because he does not know him (the
American) and asks to be excused for bothering her. Silvia
says that*s all right and. many thanks. ‘

Silvia DURAN was again visited at the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico City by the American seeking a Cuban transit visa
Mrs. DURAN contacted at least two members of the Soviet Embassy
and facilitated a direct conversation between one of the So-

erican stated that he already had been to the Soviet Consu-
late and had left an address. The Soviet official replied
that he was aware of that. The American suggested that he
had not known his address then, and he had gone to the Cuban
Embassy to ask for the address, because they had it. The
American then acceded to the Soviet official's invitation to
come by and give them the address.

other members of the family about OSWALD's visits after she
read the name and saw his picture on television, she attribu-

not like. The Station then indicates that the source of the

23 November 1963

lieved he had made arrangements in Washington whereby in-
structions would be sent to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico to
issue a Soviet entry visa in a manner which would not require
him personally to visit the Soviet Embassy. Failure of his
real or imagined instructions to work smoothly caused him to
become rude to the Soviets. Her impression was that he was
simply a "comrade" who could not live confortably under the
rigors of capitalism and wished to return to his spiritual
home in the USSR. If OSWALD talked to anyone else in the
Cuban Embassy, she was unaware of it.

Luis ECHEVARRIA told the Chief of Station that Silvia
DURAN was completely cooperative and gave a written state-
ment attesting to two visits by OSWALD. She could not remem-
ber the exact dateg but said it was the latter part of Sep-
tember. OSWALD showed her a American passport showing a !
long stay in the USSR. OSWALD said he was a communist and
an admirer of CASTRO. He wanted her help to get a transit
visa to Cuba in order to go to the USSR. She said she could
only arrange transit through Cuba if he already had a Soviet
visa. The Soviets told her that they had further checking
to do before they could issue a visa. DURAN did not know
why he returned to the United States without a visa. DURAN
told Gobernacion that she had recognized OSWALD on the tele-
vision on +22 November 1963. ‘

to Cuba right away, alone, or have his wife join him there

of the International Federation of Professional Newspaper
Organization, he was at the offices of the newspaper Excel-
Sior on the night of 25 November 1963. There he learned
through the Mexican press that the Mexican Government had
arrested one Silvia DURAN; that DURAN allegedly had OSWALD
as a guest in her house during his visit to Mexico; that
DURAN placed OSWALD in contact with officials of the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City. DIAZ Verson went on to claim that
he was told by Dr. DORRELL Navarros, an exiled Cuban news-
paperman employed by Excelsior that OSWALD and DURAN on the
day following OSWALD's arrival in Mexico City went to a res-
taurant called the Caballo Blanco or possibly the Caballo
Bayo where they met an official of the Cuban Embassy. DIAZ
Verson claimed he knows nothing about OSWALD and the Cuban
official leaving the restaurant together in a car.

Consulate in Mexico’ City about OSWALD's reported application

In its note, the Cuban Government had charged that its
Consulate's- employee, Senora Silvia DURAN, had been detained
by the police on 23 November, held in prison until midnight,
physically mistreated, and subjected to insinutations about
alleged "intimate relations" with OSWALD. The Cuban note
said that this "illegal" investigation corresponded to the
plan of reactionaries in the United States who were using
President Kennedy's assassination to promote a war policy on
the bases of accusations against Cuba and the Soviet Union.
Alleging that the Mexican police actions had disregarded the
minimum guarantees owed to employees of a consular office,
the Cuban note concluded that the incident had damaged the

made the following statements regarding Salvador DIAZ Ver-

Salvador DIAZ Verson was in Mexico City as he claimed
and did discuss Lee OSWALD with BORRELL and other Cuban
exiles. BORRELL did not tell the story credited to him by
DIAZ Verson concerning the visit to a Mexico City restaurant
by OSWALD and Silvia DURAN. BORRELL had never heard this
story or any similar story before.

BORRELL knew of no meeting between OSWALD and Cuban

Embassy officials other than the meetings which allegedly
occurred at the time OSWALD visited the Cuban Consulate in
Mexico City.

The legal Attache in Mexico City informed the Mexico
Station of current problems in the FBI's investigations of
leads pertinent to Lee Harvey OSWALD:

"a. EBI Headquarters sent a cable to Mexico stating
that Salvador DIAZ Verson was the source of the ana-

lysis prepared by Cuban psychologist, Jose I. LASAGA
of Miami.

“b. FBI interviewed DIAZ Verson who said that Silvia
DURAN took Lee OSWALD to Caballo Bayo Restaurant near
Chapultepec Golf Club where they met Cuban Ambassador
to Mexico, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas. Then HERNANDEZ
took OSWALD for a ride in his car so that they could
talk privately.

"c. DIAZ Verson told the FBI his source was Eduardo
BORRELL Navarro, Mexican newspaperman who writes edi-
torials for Excelsior.

"d. The FBI sent Matthew CRAWFORD to interview BORRELL

Navarro on 12 January. Latter sajd he did not know any

more than that OSWALD had been to Mexico and had visited

the Cuban Embassy and Silvia DURAN. He said everything
{ he knew had been published and was public knowledge.

On 17 January 1964, a source who has furnished reliable

information in the past advised that he had been unable to
locate a Caballo Blanco Restaurant in Mexico City, but stated
that there is a Caballo Bayo Restaurant located on the out-
skirts of Mexico City. He advised that on 11 January 1964,
he exhibited photographs of former Cuban Consul Busebio AZCUE
Lopez, who was in charge of the Cuban Consulate at the time
of OSWALD's visit there, of Cuban Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ
Armas, of Silvia DURAN, and of OSWALD to employees of the
Caballo Bayo Restaurant and had conducted extensive interviews
of these employees. The source said he was unable to find
anyone among the employees who could recall any of the persons
whose photographs, were exhibited as having been at the restau-
rant.

29 January 1964 * :

DIAZ Verson, the source of Jose I. LASAGA's information
that the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico City had a long conference
with Lee OSWALD at a restaurant outside Mexico City, turns out
to be a highly unreliable source, with a reputation for fabzi-
catiok. He did go to Mexico, via Guatamala and Nicaragua,
leaving Miami on 18 November 1963. He was to attend a confe-
rence in Mexico of the FIOPP (Federacion Internacional de

Organizaciones de Periodistes Professionales) between 19 and

29 November 1963.

The FBI has questioned DIAZ Verson about his story. He
said that Silvia DURAN, clerk of the Cuban Consulate in Mexico
City, took Lee OSWALD to the Caballo Cayo [sic] Restaurant
near Chapultepec Park where they mat the Cuban Ambassador
Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas and that HERNANDEZ Armas took OSWALD

for a long ride in his car so he could talk. DIAZ Verson said

that his source for this information was Mexican journalist;
Eduardo BORRELL Navarro, editorialist for the large conser-
vative daily Excelsior, but when the FBI asked BORRELL about
it he said that DIAZ Verson had made it all up. BORRELL
said he knew nothing beyond the fact that OSWALD had been in
Mexico, had visited the Cuban Embassy and talked to Silvia
DURAN.

A senior FBI official in Mexico, Clark ANDERSON, told
our Station Chief that he knew DIAZ Verson well wehn they
were both in Havana and that DIAZ Verson was noted for "re-

(Ports based on his intuitive feelings". He rarely reported
facts.

This seems to discredit completely the story, that OSWALD
had had a long conference with the Cuban Ambassador in Mexico
City.

Salvador DIAZ Verson was interviewed by Special Agent
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at Miami, Floride,
on 27 February 1964, at which time DIAZ Verson furnished the
following information:

"DIAZ Verson resides at 8770 S.W. 21st Street, West-
chester, Miami, Florida. He is a Cuban exile, for-
merly associated with the Cuban police in 1933, Chief
of Cuban Military Intelligence Service during the
period 1948 to 1952, but primarily a newspaperman by
profession. : es

“He had been previously interviewed by a Special
Agent of the FBI on January 4 and 9, 1964, on which
dates he furnished the data which he had obtained
while attending a Congress of the Internationa
Federation of Professional Newspaper Organizations
(FIOPP), in Mexico City, from November 20, 1963 to
November 29, 1963.

“He stated he knew absolutely nothing first hand
concerning the visit of Lee Harvey [OSWALD to Mexico
or of persons contacted by OSWALD while in Mexico.

He stated, as previously reported, that he did have
contact with Dr. Eduardo BORRELL Navarro, who is
employed by the Mexican newspaper Excelsior, but
stated he did not, and does not, attribute to Dr.
BORRELL Navarro the information regarding the contact
of OSWALD with Silvia DURAN, an employee of the Cuban
Consulate at a Mexico City restaurant.

"DIAZ gtated the only contact of OSWALD discussed by
him with BORRELL Navarro was that of the visit of
OSWALD to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico, and the fact
that Silvia DURAN was picked up and interviewed by the
Mexican police. He said there was some speculation
and talk regarding the identity of the specific offi-
cial of the Cuban Consulate or Embassy with whom DURAN
may have placed OSWALD in contact. DIAZ Verson stated
Dr. BORRELL Navarro never stated that OSWALD went to a
restaurant in Mexico City called the Caballo Blanco or
possibly the Caballo Bayo, where OSWALD and DURAN alle-
gedly met an official of the Cuban Embassy. DIAZ Ver-
son stated he did not discuss with BORRELL Navarro the
allegation that OSWALD was a.gust,in the house of Sil-
via DURAN while he was in Mexico. ‘

"DIAZ Verson stated the matter of OSWALD allegedly
meeting with DURAN at the restaurant and allegedly be-
ing a guest in her home, were strictly unidentified
questions, comments, and the voicing of thoughts and

speculation by a rather large group of Latin American
newspapermen in the offices of Exeelsior on the night
of November 25, 1963. —

"DIAZ Verson stated that after Angel FERNANDEZ Varela
was interviewed by the FBI in Miami, he came to DIAZ
Verson and asked: ‘Just what were those details about
OSWALD meeting DURAN in some cabaret or restaurant in
Mexico City and the introduction of OSWALD to an offi-
cial of the Cuban Embassy?’ FERNANDEZ Varela admitted
he had not understood the story too well and perhaps
had confGsed it 'a little’ when he retold it.

"On February 29, 1964, upon being further interviewed
concerning variations in his accounts of the above
events, and especially the sources responsible for
certain specific statements, DIAZ Verson admitted that
he did make statements to a Special Agent of the FBI
on January 4 and 9, 1964, slightly at variance with
each other, and both at variance with what he related
to another Special Agent of the FBI on February 27,
1964, He stated he did not do this out of malice or
bad faith, or with intent to mislead anyone. He de-
clared he did not regard anything he heard, os said he
had heard in Mexico, as evidence, or of serious impor-
tance; he stated he had engaged in loose talk and re-
peated theory and speculation, and when challenged as
to his sources, he was ashamed to admit an irrespon-
sible naming of sources.

"

"DIAZ Verson declined to take a polygraph examination
stating it would only humiliate him further, and show
what he had already admitted.
“With regard to a relationship between BORREL Navarro
and. Horacio DURAN Navarro, DIAZ Verson stated BORRELL
Navarro is a Cuban, only temporarily residing in exile
in Mexico City. Horacio DURAN Navarro and his wife,
Silvia, are Mexicans. DIAZ Verson stated that Cuba
protested the arrest and interrogation of Silvia DURAN
by the Mexican Police; the Mexican Foreign Office re-
jected the protest, and in doing so, stated DURAN
Navarro and wife are Mexican citizens. DIAZ Verson
stated this was the account published in Mexico City
newspapers, and he concluded the same materfal name
of Navarro for BORRELL Navarro and DURAN Navarro is only
coincidence."

their having been in a group with OSWALD here last fall dur-
ing the days that he was in Mexico. The write-ups of the

cussion, and they apparently had never really sat around de-

The main points covered:

"Elena and Deba are first cousins of three young
Mexicans named DURAN - Ruben, Horacio, and Lynn.
Horacio is the husband of Silvia DURAN, the Mexi-
can girl who was arrested for questioning about
OSWALD because she had been in touch with him at
the Cuban Embassy when he went there looking for
a visa. [She is or was also a ringleader (no ad-
tional details provided by source) at the Cuban-
Mexican Institute, according to the source.]

“While OSWALD was here last fall the DURAN cousins
invited the GARRO sisters and young Elena PAZ to a
‘twist party’ at the home of Ruben DURAN mid-week.
A few communists they knew (Deba is a communist and
“Elena has been in touch with communists since she
was a young girl and went to Republican Spain with
Octavio PAZ.) and a number of people who struck
them as very peculiar at the time, were there
OSWALD was there with two other beatnik looking
boys, one of whom was very tall and all three of
whom they remember quite well. When they began
asking questions about the Americans, who were
standing together all evening and did not dance

at all, they were shifted to another room (the
FARRO's were); however, they were intrigued be-
cause their cousin said he did not know who they
were, except that Silvia DURAN had brought them,
and none of the other guests made any attempt to
approach them. When the GARRO's were’ so’ insistent
about meeting them, the DURANS replied that the
boys were leaving town very early the next morning.
The next day, well along in the day, the GARRO sis-
ters and Elenita PAZ saw all three boys together
on Insurgentes. In other words, they had not left
town. At the time they they remarked about it.

"As soon as OSWALD's picture was printed in the news-
papers all three clearly remembered him, and, of
course, the arrest of Silvia DURAN almost immedi-
ately afterward, underlined their certainty. They
were so sickened (Elena and Elehita) that they broke
off their relations with the DURANs; however, their
cousins very nervously looked them up later, Deba de
Guerrero GALVAN says that Lynn DURAN and one of the
DURAN boys have madé trips to Texas, and that most
conspicuously they have all prospered this last year
Always poor before, they now have an expensive car
each.
“Horacio DURAN works on the El Dia newspaper."

24 November 1964

1964 by Elena Garro de PAZ and her daughter, Elena PAZ Garro

“They are residents of Mexico City, but declined to
supply their home address. Mrs. PAZ stated she is a
cousin of Ruben, Lidia, and Horacio DURAN, the latter
being the husband of Silvia Pirado de DURAN. She said
she had not furnished previously the information set
forth hereinafter because of fear of reprisals.

"Mrs. PAZ said that on August 23, 1963, she attended
a dinner at the home of a Mexican communist whom she
declined to identify. Among others present at this
dinner were Cuban Consul Fusebio AZCUE and his wife
She had not previously known AZCUE. In conversation
with him during the course of.the evening she learned
that he was supposed to return to Cuba on or about
August 27, 1963. She later learned that he did not
depart Mexico at that time.

"According to Mrs. PAZ, she had infrequent contact
with her cousins, the DURHNS; however, on a-date she
fixed as Saturday, September 28, 1963, she received

a telephone call from Ruben DURAN, who invited her

and her daughter to attend a party at his house during
the first past of the following week.’ She was unable
to fix the exact date of this party, but felt it had
been held on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday,’ September
30, October 1, and October 2, 1963, respectively, with
the most likely possibility that it was held on the
evening of October 1 or October 2, 1963.

"It was Mrs. PAZ' recollection that at about 9:00 a.m.
on the date of the party she and her daughter were
picked up and taken to the party by Lidia DURAN. Also
accompanying them was Mrs. PAZ' sister, Deva Garro de
Guerrero GALVAN. She described this sister as a commu-
nist who was expelled from the Party for being a Catho-
lic.

"

"At about 10:39 p.m. three young, white Americans arri-
ved at the party. They were greeted by Silvia DURAN
and spoke only to her. They more or less isolated
themselves from the rest of the party and insofar as
she observed they had no conversation with anyone else
at the party.

"The three Americans appeared to be between twenty-two
and twenty-four years of age. One of them was dressed
in a sweater and dark trousers and appeared to be about
five feet nine inches in height. The second one was
about six feet tall, had blond, straight hair, a long
chin, and was a bit 'beatnik' in appearance although
his dress included a coat. The third American wore

no coat.

"

"It is to be noted that investigation has established
that Lee Harvey OSWALD departed Mexico City by bus at
8:30 a.m. on October 2, 1963, and could not hdve been
identical with the American allegedly observed by Mrs.
PAZ at the party of this party were held on the evening
of October 1 or October 2, 1963.

30 June. 1965 : (date of dissemination)

The Agency forwards a dissemination to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation containing information on Silvia

DURAN.

"1. A-usually reliable and senisitive source
reports that on 15 June 1965 an unidentified
woman speaking French called Joaquin HERNANDEZ
Armas, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, from Chicago.
The woman stated she was calling on behalf of a
Mr. GAN (phonetic); she asked whether Silvia
DURAN was a friend of Harvey Lee OSWALD, and if
DURAN had returned to Cuba. The Ambassador, who
does not understand much French, said that DURAN
used to work at the Embassy, no longer does, and
that she resides in Mexico, but he does not know
the address. The woman again asked if DURAN was
a friend of OSWALD. The Anbassador, who appeared
not to understand the question fully, answered
affirmatively.”

10 December 1965 : (date of report)

Charles W. THOMAS, Political Officer, U.S. Embassy,
Mexico City, reports that in the course of a discussion
about other matters, Sra. de PAZ mentioned that she had
met Lee Harvey OSWALD. She was very reluctant to discuss
the matter, but finally imparted the following information:

"1, In September 1963, shortly after her return from
abroad, she went to a party at the home of Ruben DURAN,
who is married to her cousin. Her daughter, Elenita,
accompanied her. There she met OSWALD and two other
young Americans who were with him. The three young
Americans remained apart from the other guests. She
expressed an interest in talking to them, but was dis-
couraged from doing so by some of the other guests.

"2. Most of the guests at the party were communists

or philocommunists. She remembers seeing the Cuban
Consul, ASQUE [sic - AZCUE]; General Clark FLORES of
the Mexican Olympic. Committee; Silvia DURAN, who she
later learned was OSWALD's mistress while he was here;
Emilio fARBALLIDO, the writer, who she thinks is now |
in the United States; and a Latin American Negro man
with red hair.

"3, In November 1963, when the identity of Kennedy's
assassin became known, she and her daughter went to
the Cuban Embassy and, once admitted through the front
gate, shouted 'assassin' and other insults at the staff
there.

"4, Shortly afterward, she ‘and her daughter were visited
by a friend, Manuel CARVILLO, who was then an official
in the Secretariat of Gobernacion, and were told he had
orders to escort them to a smalI and obscure hotel in

the center of town. They were kept there for eight days
under pretext that they were in danger.

When she told €ARVILLO she wanted to go to the Aneri-
can Embassy and explain what she knew of OSYALD's co-
mnections here with Mexican communists and Cubans ,
she was told that the American Embassy was full of
communist spies. She said CARVILLO tries to give the
impression that he is an extreme rightist. He now
has a job with Bellas Artes.

"5S. Some of the other people who were at the party
with OSWALD were taken to the state of. Veracruz,
where they were 'protected' by Governor LOPEZ Arias.
Ruben DURAN is reportedly ‘protect! by General Clark
FLORES and is now driving a big car and looking very
prosperous.
"6. Many communists and philocommunists here believe
Kennedy's assassination was the result of a communist
plot engineered by Fidel CASTRO. Ruben DURAN has sub-
sequently told her that he is not really a communist
and that it had been a great mistake to kill Kennedy.”

On 25 December 1965, Elena Garro de PAZ again discussed
at considerable length her alleged encounter with OSWALD. Some
further information on this subject was given subsequently
on 9 January 1966. During this latter conversation, Mrs. de PAZ
admitted that she had gone to the Embassy on an earlier occa-
sion with her daughter and mother-in-law and had talked with
two Embassy officers (presumably from the Legal Attache's of-
fice) about this matter. She said since the Embassy officers
did not give much credence to anything they said, they did not
bother to give a very complete story. The following informa-
tion supplements and in some instances corrects that given
in the memorandum of 10 December. ~

"4, Although Sra. de PAZ had returned from an extended
stay in Europe only in June or July, she had already
met Eusebio AZCUE and knows positively that he was at
the Party. On another occasion (it was not clear
whether before or after the party in question), she at-
tended a party where she saw, among others, Eusebio
AZCUE; Fmilio CARBALLIDO, the pro-CASTRO writer; and a
Latin American negro man with red hair. (These last
two were not at the DURAN party as was mistakenly sta-
ted in the December 10 memorandum.) .. . The day
after the assassination, Elenita de PAZ encountered
Sra. de AZCUE in Saborns. On seeing her, Sra. de AZCHE
turned and hurried out of the store. AZCUE was imme-
diately called back to Havana after the assassination,.
and his wife followed him shortly thereafter. (NB:
According to Agency files, AZCUE left Mexico City on

18 November 1963 - four days before the assassination.)

"7, Later that day [23 November 1963], they were visited
by a friend, Manuel VALVILLO, who said’that they were in
serious danger from the communists and that he would take
them to a small hotel where they would be safe for a few
days. . . . Among other things he said was that Sylvia
DURAN had been arrested. This was not public informa:
tion at that time. [According to Blena de PAZ, CALVILLO
was known around town to be an undercover agent for the
Secretariat of Gobernacion and to be a personal friend
of Noe PALOMARES and Gustavo DIAZ Ordaz.)}

"13, At about the end of January 1964, Ruben DURAN v

26 May 1967

During a meeting with his agent handler, LIRING/3
Stated that "he was doing his best to keep active cer-
contacts he had had in the past that were on the periphery
of the official Cuban circle. He mentioned specifically
the case of Silvia and Horacio DURAN... He related that
Silvia DURAN worked as a receptionist at the Consulate in
1963-1964 and was on duty when Lee Harvey OSWALD applied
for a visa. She had been recommended to the Cubans by Teresa
PROENZA, the Press Attache from 1959 until 1962. LIRING/3
described Teresa PROENZA as a Cuban woman aged about 52, a
Lesbian, and a member of the Communist Party of Cuba, who
was currently in jail in Cuba as the result of a conviction
for espionage on behalf of CIA. LIRING/3 recalled that dur-
ing his last visit.to Havana, a friend of his in the Minis-
try of Education, informed him of Teresa PROENZA's present
Situation and advised LIRING/3, in the event he was asked,
he deny that he had known Teresa PROENZA or had had anything
to do with her. LIRING/3 continued that just the other day
Silvia DURAN had telephoned him to say hello and that he had
visited her at her hone to renew his acquaintance.

(LIFEAT SAN-26 (10.8) reveals that at about 1245

on 22 May 1967, LIRING/3 telephoned 15-78-11 and

asked for Sra. Silvia. When (the maid) informed
him she was not in, he asked for Sr. Horacio,

dying at some school and at the moment is free

to talk to LIRING/3. The latter replies that

he would go by to visit her (Constituyentes143,

apt. 3) in a few minutes.]

LIRING/3 continued that Silvia DURAN informed him that
she had first met OSWALD when he applied for a visa and had
gone out with him several times since she liked him from the
Start. She admitted that she had sexual relations with him
but insisted that she had no idea of his plans. When the
news of the assassination broke she stated that she was im-
mediately taken into custody by the Mexican police and in-
terrogated thoroughly and beaten until she admitted that she
had had an affair with OSWALD. She added that ever since
then she has cut off all contact with the Cubans, particu-
larly, since her husband Horacio who was badly shaken by the
whole affair, went into a rage and has forbidden her to see
them. She added that she felt certain that her telephone
was tapped by the Mexican police, or, more probubly by CIA,
since tapping was an expensive proposition and the Mexicans
wouldn't be able to afford it for so long a period.

ROWTON (P), LIRING/3's agent handler, counseled LIRING/3
against further contact with the DURAN's on the ground that it
might put him under some sort of suspi¢ion whether in the eyes
of the Mexican police or the Cubans. He pointed out that lit-
tle -r nothing was to be gained from such a contact.”

Renn ebTs concerning Leé Harvey OSWALD and the assassination ‘of President :
Kennedy. wo : .

“a. Shortly after the assassination of President
Kennedy, boorse and Jeanne de MO RENSCHILDT were
among the ‘guests attending a- cocktail party in Haiti.
:_+ + The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was ~7

any substance to the view expressed in certain foreign:
periodicals such as’ L'Express, a left-wing Parisian
weekly newspaper, that the Kennedy assassination was
a plot organized by Dallas millionnires. George de
MOHRENSCHILDT said that President Kennedy was hated
by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was-very
likely that certain reactionary elements in Dallas ha
organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis
turbed person such as OSWALD to achieve their ends. :
Mrs, de MOHRENSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis. :
