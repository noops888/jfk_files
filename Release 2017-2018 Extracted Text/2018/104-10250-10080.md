\NDUM FOR: Jim O'Connor, TSD/Sscurity

SUBJECT: Contact with Herman E, Kimsey - Jan Beck, TSD/GARB

1, As you requested at our meeting on 25 January, I heve prepared
this sumiary of my contact with Mr. Kimsey since he left the Agency

in August, 1962.

2, Ky contact with K, has been via the telephone, except for a
couple of occasions when I hed lunch with him or he visited Chief, GARB

in Central Building, I cannot re
to me heve been nostly to the off

cell ever calling him, but his calls

ice end only a few to my home.

3, With a few exceptions his reason for calling seems to have
been non-specific; he just wanted to chat. Often he would open the
convers-tion wit 2 gambit ef asking for someone's telephone extension,

what they were doing nowadays, and so on. Since I usually avoided

answering such questions directly, I cannot tell if he already knew
about the person in question and wanted confirmation, or if he was
fishing. The bulk of the converstions then consisted nainly of
dialogue about his job plens, femily, mutual friends outside the igency,

and so on,

4. Several calls were about the one instance when I was directly

involved with him on a project.

It pertained to a job opening which

I had heard about and wented to pass on to hin. It was as a document
exeminer or a related job with the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office,
Portland, Oregon. He seened interested in pursuing the possibility,
put in a recent conversation he had still not applied and did not seem

interested.

6. Until'22 January hehad no‘. mentioned the subject of the
Polish colonel at all, He called me at home, and I immediately
x up the subj2ct since I had read about his disclosures in the
pa a week earlior. ‘when I prodded him about being in trouble
over the newspeper interview, he appeared confident thet he was not
in any trouble because he was "in daily contact with Agency people".
He further said that his purpose in the disclosure wes to pry loose
from the Agency those documents which would help the colonel establish
his true i 3 But it was pretty obvious thet K, was surpised by
the big play given the story in the paper. In fact, he had even
considered calling the reporter and asking him to retract some
distortions - he did not say which - in the story, but on second thought
could not put his finger on any clear-cut error worth ‘fighting over.
Other items frort the conversation: if the colonel's cleim is successful

and that s to tell me that the colonel was to be on television, the 11
