PG 92-236
On February 14, 1966, PG T-6 advised:

Recently, KELLY MANNARINO called aff indi-
vidual on the telephone and told this individual that
he would give him "the book" for all types of bets,
but this person stated, "What if I don't accept?" |
MANNARINO replied, "Think it over for one day-and-
then I believe you will." It was rumored that this
person thought it over and thereafter took the booking
action. The unknown individual called at the time
is still not known. E

LA_COSA NOSTRA

It is noted that it has been reported
previously that sources have identified GABRIEL
MANNARINO as a member of La Cosa Nostra.

On March 10, 1966, PG T-7 advised:

In a recent conversation with ANTHONY
"WHITEY" BESASE, LCN member from Toledo, Ohio,
BESASE stated that TONY DELSANTER, Warren, Ohio,
is a member of the "Cleveland family." BESASE
also indicated that he has been in frequent con-
tact, of late, with KELLY MANNARINO and TONY RIPEPI,
Pittsburgh members of La Cosa Nostra; however, in-
formant was unable to ascertain the purpose of these
contacts.

MISCELLANEOUS
On February 18, 1966, P@ T-1 advised:

4 Recently, SAM MANNARINO stated that while
he was incarcerated at United-States Penitentiary,
Lewisburg, Pa., from mid-1964 to mid-1965, a building
contractor named (FNU) DALEY had cheated him out of
a substantial amount of money. According to MANNARINO,
his brother, KELLY MANNARINO, and "some friends" had
come to him, upon his release, and suggested the killing
‘of DALEY, but MANNARINO claimed he disuaded them from
this course of action, saying that the risk involv
was too great for the snl amount of money he had lost.
