assertions were the subject of official inquiry:

“TL. organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select
Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for
Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the
investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
“follows:

This crime was committed on United
States soil. Therefore, as far as the
Federal government was concerned, the pri-
mary investigating agency would have been
the Federal Bureau of Investigation without
any question. The role of the CIA would

have: been entirely supportive in the sense

had no investigative role inside the United
States at all. So when I used here the

word "supportive," I meant that in the

literal sense of the term. We are (sic)

trying to support the FBI and support the

Warren Commission and be responsive to

their requests, but we were not initiating

‘any investigations of our own or, to my
recollection, were we ever asked to.

{Executive Session Testimony of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 17-18.) .

On November 23, 1963. Helms. called a meeting of senior-
level CIA officials to outline the Agency's investiga-
tive responsibility vis a vis the assassination. (SSC,
Book v, p-.25.). At that time, Helms placed John Scelso,

Scelso testified before the Select Committee,

that he was given charge of the Agency's investigation
on the basis of two considerations: 1)!his prior
experience in conducting major CIA security investi-
gations and 2) the observance of Oswald by CIA

surveillance in Mexico, (Scelso's operational concern)

less than two months. prior to the assassination. (SSC

Book V, p. 25, HSCA Class. Deposition of John Scelso,

5/16/70, pp. 111-112.°;) Scelso also noted that

theories nor reach conclusions within a set period of

(Executive Session Testimony of Richard Helms, 8/9/78,

Helms' reasoning was expanded upon by Raymond

in part by the establishment of the Warren Commission.
(HSCA Classified Deposition of Raymond Rocca, pp. 12-13.)

‘all of the (cra) divisions." Angleton testifed
to this Committee that the Agency's efforts to
gather and coordinate information related to

the assassination underwent a metamorphic
transition. Initially, Angleton noted, the
Director, Deputy Director, Division Chiefs and
Case Officers approached Warren comission£~
requirements in a piecemeal. fashion: However,
Angleton testified the Agency was eventually
able to focus its’ resources to avoid duplication
of effort and provide a system for the central

Mr. Goldsmith.. But I believe earlier we

As noted above, the CI Staff assumed responsibility
in late December 1963 - early January 1964 for the
coordination of CIA efforts to assist the Warren
Commission in its investigation. At that time, Raymond
Rocca, Chief of Research and Analysis for CI Staff,
was designated point of contact with the Warren
Commission. (HSCA Classified Deposition of James

-.A, Opinions. of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren. Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of
the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of
the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-
generated information to the Warren Commission. The
general cansensus of these representatives is that the
Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful
working relationship during the course’of the Commission's
investigation.  “(HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,
p.-18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test..of Richard Helms,
8/9/78,.p. 24.) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel
for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren
Commission staff. counsel W. David Slawson on matters
which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

«

highly competent, cooperative, and. intelligent. ™@ »
(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,
8/2/78.) Mx. Slawson expressed a similar opinion

regarding the Agency's cooperation and quality

"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information
bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the
supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was
propounded by Richard Helms. -Mr. Helms, who served as
the CIA's Deputy Director for. Plans auring the Warren
Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the
CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination Andthe

CIA made every effort to. be as responsive as possible to
Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard
Helms; 8/9/78,  p- 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony
regarding the manner in-which the CIA provided its infor-
mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-

mission). We would attempt to respond to it.

Mr. Goldsmith: In summary, is it your. position that

Mr. Helms: That is correct. Pr

(Ibid., p. 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

Commission requests ona casthbSsis rather than uniformly
‘volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission
stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's perception
of the CIA's investigative responsibility. . Mr. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by thé

reticence to inform the Warren Commission, at least

oN

during. the initial stage of the Commission's work, P
of the CIA' s[ telephonic and ]photo surveillance

The reason for the sensitivity of these

only becyp@se it was sensitive from the
Agency's standpoint, but the [telephone
taps were [funning i onjunction with

the Mexican authorities) and therefore,

if this had become public knowledge,

it would have caused[{very bad feelings

and that was the reason.. (Exec. Sess. ;

The CIA's unwillingness. to inform the Warren

a-source of concern to this Committee. It is 4 yt
indicative of an Agency policy designed

The Committee's belief that Slawson had t a

further supported by reference to his memorandum
of March 27, 1964 (CD 692) wherein he states his

conclusion, hé ‘wrote, was based upon an analysis of
Silvia Duran's testimony before the Mexican police:
This memorandum bears no indication that he had
reviewed any of the Duran transcripts. Furthermore,
had Slawson been given access to these transcripts,

During the Rockefeller Commission. inquiry,
Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

intercepts at might suggest foreknowledge
ofa plot fo assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether she
had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

“Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me enfere

(the first person of the verb enterstegis,

past tense) should be translated as -i found

almost before Kennedy 7did7."- In other words,
Calderon was saying she -héard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's
position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderos ¢

On May 8 Langosch further @isclosed AMMUG's

Langosch paraphrased ANMUG's knowledge of Calderon
as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have p
had contact with Oswald because I learned

about 17: March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to Mexico, that she had been

involved with an American in Mexico. The

information to which I refer was told to

me by a DGI case officer... I-had commented

to (him) that it seemed strange that Luisa

Calderon was. receiving a salary from the

DGI although she apparently did not do

any work for the Service. (The case officer)

told me that hers was a-peculiar case and

that he himself. believed that she had been

recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head

of the DGI, did not agree.. As I recall,

(the case officer) had investigated Luisa :
Calderon. This was because, during the time ?
she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted d
a letter to her by an American who signed

his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in

Spanish so Iam not sure of how the name

mentioned by Hernandez .should be spelled.

It could have been “Howara" or something

different. As I understand the matter, ere ‘
the letter from the American was a love

letter but indicated that there was a

clandestine professional relationship é
between the writer and Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the case officer)

that after the interception of the letter

she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.. I do not know if ’
this could have been Oswald... (Ibid.)

in what form this information was provided,

The CIA responded by memorandum:

“Although the (Mexico City) Station considered

The Committee's initial review of the
materials provided by the CIA to the Warren
Commission did not disclose the existence of the
AMMUG files. However, the Committee did during
the course of its review examine a file containing
material passed to the Rockefeller Commission. . That
file made reference to A-1. Included in this
file was a memorandum of May 5, 1964 written by
Joseph Langosch which concerned information A-1
provided about the Oswald case. (CIA Doc. FOIA 68-290
Langosch Memorandum, 5/5/64) Also contained within
this file were the A-1l debriefing memorando of
May 7, and May 8, 1964 previously cited with regard
to Luisa Calderon. (CIA Doc. FOIA #687-295, attach's

Committee requested access to all CIA files

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

g When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-1's defection
and considered the possibility that he
might have some knowledge of the Oswald
case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions
to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing
AMMUG~1...WH desk records reflect that
AMMUG-1 was debriefed on 4 May 64 regarding

¢ this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing
on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive
y matter, it was dictated directly to a CI
M4 (Counterintelligence) stenographer on
5 May 1964. /Note: A-1 was debriefed on
oN several subjects on 4 May 64. ‘The procedure
& 4 Al was to assign each subject discussed a
v 4 debriefing number and they were written
\ ¢ up in contact report form by the WH case
a. officer. The instructions from CI staff
were to handle the Oswald case debriefing
é \j very closely and not to keep any copies in

WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing
report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly
to a CI staff stenographer. There would

be no reason to include the number 40 on
the report of this special debriefing for
CI staff, since it was their only debriefing
report. We are certain it is the debriefing
report (#40) because the date is the same;
it is the only debriefing report on Oswald @m i.
listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)
the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in
Oswald's 201 file.

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this
Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit
executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who “served
as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the
entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs
Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it
progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent L. Pollock,
executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically
contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation
was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond
FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an
assassination operation. In pertinent part, Pollock
drew the following conclusions:

b To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald

considered the AMLASH operation to be a political
. action activity with the objective of organizing

a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the
Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. TI heard
Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation
frequently, and never heard him characterize it as
an "assassiantion operation." Mr. FitzGerald
stated within my hearing on several occasions
his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

p loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH
operation as an “assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I,~as Executive Officer, never
discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with
Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the othgr
branch chiefs and the special assistants could no
have so characterized it since they did not know
about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a
hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH
for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day
of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the
pen with disdain. /Tbid., par. 4, p. 2/), (Ibid.,
par. 6, p. 3)

not simp1y "ba fog is tds Sit spateric
from ClA—controlled documents:
assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death. The broader and more significant issue,
as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether
the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy
to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH Operation this
determination is a most difficult matter to
resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their
characterization of the Agency's operational
objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence
it-is the Committee's position that such informa-
tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,
might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-
tive concern for possible Cuban involvement or
complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin
commented before this Committee:

+:+when I read...the Church Committee's %

report--it was an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

could have happened back in 1964.

I think there would have been a

much better charice of getting to

the heart of it. It might have

only revealed that we are involved

in it and who approved it and all
that. But I think that would

have at least come out. (HSCA Class.
Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin

that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to

the Warren Commission, the Commission might have

been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture

that has s‘urrounded the AMLASH operation during

the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH

operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba andthe United States.
