OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30,

1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations

/Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5412 Augmented

by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for

providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress."

(00181)

Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection

upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.

The plan itself at pages 00183 through 00187 included establishing intelligence-agents

inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting

ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical Surveys of air fields, military

installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government

organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and negotiating for British help in

contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation.

"The British want to

know, 'how serious are you?', before risking their assets to help the U.S.".7(00180-00187)

" A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.

Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least

create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve

CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which will permit provocative

actions in support of a shift to overaction.

Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate

to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks

are for each of the entitities involved then follows in Lansdale's memo. The memorandum

notes that the President directed that the Chief of Operations conduct the project through

the appropriate organizations and departments of the government.

In this regard the memo

of a resisitence movement will not remain controllable, so that operational time tables

produced during the next four weeks can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of

The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for inside Cuba

have been assessed in depth. Fifteen locations have been selected as suitable centers for

Operation MONGOOSE."

Hard intelligence coverage of Cuba has been developed. Fifty-nine

controlled agents inside of Cuba exist.

Not so successful on infiltrating intelligence

reporting in resistence cadre teams. Failure to meet the original schedule of team in-

filtrations primarily was due to two factors: "(a) Lack of policy approval by higher

authority to make any extensive utilization of Department of Defense personnel and support."

"Had we been permitted to mount a more intensive and agressive, the original infiltration

schedule probably would have been met, possibly exceeded."

The speed and extent of future

infiltration teams for resisitence purposes into Cuba "will of course depend upon policy

approvals by higher authority and the amount of support we can count on thereunder."

OCCURRENCE:

Lansdale briefed the group on numbers of agents in Cuba.

Air resupply

proposal submitted by CIA "should be deferred pending broader review of the entire

situation." Taylor noted if urgent need for air supply proposal could be made to the

Special Group Augmented at any time. "Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra-

tions of the Cuban government have yet been attained."

"The Attorney General inquired

about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt

against him." Lansdale replied, "There is no rallying point for active oppesition."

The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities

by Castro in the hemisphere.

A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of

July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al-

ternatives open to the U.S. should be developed." tookne into monosalsto suhcidira
