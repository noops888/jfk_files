CARD ONE OF TWO

OCCURRENCE: As to Phase I, CIA staff personnel@uyy veg are devoting full time to this
effort. '"A very large number of additional personnel are devoting part time efforts to
Operation MONGOOSE." Hard intelligence coverage of Cuba has been developed. Fifty-nine
controlled agents inside of Cuba exist. Not so successful on infiltrating intelligence
reporting in resistence cadre teams. Failure to meet the original schedule of team in-

filtrations~primarity-was~due—to—two-factors:— (a)—Lack-of-poliey—approval_by—higher-

authority to make any extensive utilization of Department of Defense personnel and support.”
"Had we been permitted to mount a more intensive and agressive, the original infilitration
schedule probably would have been met, possibly exceeded.'' The speed and extent of future
infiltration teams for resisitence purposes into Cuba "will of course depend upon policy
approvals by higher authority and the amount of support we can count on thereunder."

"It is our opinion that there is an excellent chance such a revolt could be incited
