On 1/17/83, source was queried concerning any

knowledge he might have of the NOSENKO matter.

He advised

that "officially" the KGB never discusses defectors and

generally all one would hear would be rumor and gossip.

JOSENKO is considered a "tr

as far as source is aware. (XY" in the eyes of the KGB

The source assumed that NOSENKO told western

intelligence everything concerning Second Chief Directorate

(SCD) activities in Moscow and further assumes that, as is

custom, a

"special Commission" of the SCD was convened

following NOSENKO's defection to do a damage assessment.

As an aside, source noted that his defection would be

"examined" by members of the K Directorate of the First

Chief Directorate and by members of the 9th Department of the

§ DirectorateS

Source has no knowledge concerning any connection

between the NOSENKO defection in 1964 and LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S

assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963.

Asked

to give his opinion on the merits of some speculation that

NOSENKO defected under the direction of the KGB to convince

the US that the KGB had nothing to do with OSWALD's actions,

source did not believe that to be the case.

In source's

opinion, NOSENKO's defection and all the information he furnished

about the sc would have been too great a price to pay "to

save one man.".

и)

Source does not believe that the KGB would risk

'blowing an illegal" by tasking the illegal to

attempt to

locate a defector such as NOSENKO in the west!S) Likewise,

source has never heard that the KGB killed or attempted to kill

a defector.

COMMENT:

by the KGB to attempt to verify NOSENKO's presence at a

Nashington, D.C. apartment complex. ATLAST Was not,

given NOSENKO's name but only a physical description.
