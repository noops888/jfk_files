1. WOFIRM has been requested by an Australian newspaper
editor (Attachment A) to release the Warren Commission Document

$71 (CD 971 is Attachment 8) which relates te anonymous telephone
calls to the Canberra Embassy at the time of the assassination of
President Kennedy. His request was turned down. As you probably
know, there has been mounting public pressure to release classified
documents of the Warren Commission. While no decision has been
made to declassify Cb 971, it is highly possible we will be asked
to do so in the near future by National Archives, which bas
official custody of the documents, or by some higher authority.

2. Melbourne Station is requested to discuss Paragraph -
One above with SQUIB/1 afterhis return to Australia. The SQUIB
service is mentioned in Paragraph 4 of CD 971 and release of the
document is certain to provoke questions in Australia. Since
CD 971 is a U. 8S. Government document we need not (and should not)
request SQUIB concurrence for release of the document. He should
be informed, however, that release of CD 971 to the public domain
is presently under consideration; that the United States Navy
has no objections; and that we are giving his advance notice as
a matter of courtesy. Any views voluateered by SQUIB/1 regarding
this release should be reported promptly to Headquarters.
