DB MEMO #6585

3 January 1964
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, wa/2
ATTENTION: ;
BUBJECCT: —— rea of Letter and Envelope -
REVERENCE! Ws/2 Memo dated 13 December 1963

1. In response to referenced request, an original typewritten
letter and envelope addressed to the American Embasay, Stockholm,
were examined in order to determine the origin of the letter and the
nationality of the writer.

2. The following conclusions were drawn concerning the letter
and envelope:

a. The typewriter in question is equipped with an obsolete
style of German-made type which, according to our references, was
fitted on a muaiber of typevriters made in Germany during the 1920s
and early 1930s. The possible makes would be Btoewer, Torpedo,
Mercedes, Rheinmetall, Urania, Orga, Fortuna, Continental, Kappel,
Groma, Triumph, Mere and possibly some others. Of these makes,
the Torpedo, Mercedes, Rheimmetall and Triumph were probably the
most widely distributed.

b. The machine in question is equipped with a black and red
ribbon. The keyboard is very probably Swedish, as shown by two
strike-overs: umlaut-u for hyphen end "sz" for “a”. These
characters are adjacent on the standard Svedish keyboard, but not
on the German. The umlaut-a was not used in the street address,
"Strandvagen” (where the dots should have been placed over the
second "a"). hia might be either a simple oversight or an attempt
to conceal the writer's familiarity with the correct spelling.

baa ad of the letter is of the international standard
(om)" size "AN" which fe almost universally used in Sveden. The
linen-textured stationery seems to be rather common in Sweden.

The two emaller pieces of blank paper match the letter paper with
respect to width, thickness, color, texture and look-through, and
were probably cut from another sheet of the same type. ‘The envelope
matches specimens of Swedish envelopes taken from DB/5+Postal.
Intelligence files.

a. The letter was posted from the Stockholm Ban post office,
which is located in the central railway terminal in Stockholm.
All mail deposited in street mail boxes in this area or in the post
office would be processed through this station.

e. The cancellation cachet on the envelope is identical in
all respects (format, postmark, mumber style and length of killer
bars) to exemplars available in our office.

f. The postage 1s correct for Swedish internal mail and the
postage stemp is of current issue.

g- A possible irregularity is the time lag between the internal
date of the letter, the date of the postmark and the date of receipt
in the American Exbassy. The total time from the internal date of
the letter to the time of receipt is eight days, the time between
the date of posting and the date of receipt is more than three days.
This tranait time of more than three days for intra-city mail appears
irregular when compared with the average transit time of only two-
three dsys for arrival between Stockholm and the United States.

3- The text of the letter warrants some comments because a nwnber
of peculiarities were noted - aside from pure spelling or typing errors -
which seem to indicate a Swedish writer. The folloving words represent.
either Swedish spelling or modification: "reserv", “etablished", "“murded",

"Krustjev" .« Other examples of Swedish grammar ana syntax would be:

must" (as past tense), “in Soviet” (Svedish form tut not spelling),
“he was spy” (without indefinite article), "FBI, UGA" (without definite
article), "should" (rather than "would”), "“outsomggled"” (Swedish past
participle form), and “whole the world” (pure Swedish form).

4. Another significant detail is the name given, “Ryo Lieng Yuan”.
"Ryo" is not a standard spelling in any known Romanization system used
for Chinese. "R" is seen in the new Chinese Commmnist national system,
but never in combination with "yo". "Ryo" is a Japanese spelling. In
the name given it is not-kmown whether the Chinese or Western presen-
tation is used, in other words, whether “Ryo” or. "Yuan" is meant to be
the surname. Among Chinese syllables which could be represented by the

Japanese "Ryo" are Liao, Iieng and lung. Of these Lung ('10:7893) and
Idang (102733). ere used as survames. In either case, “Ryo” is hardly
6 name by which a real Chinese would identify himself.

5. In summary, and based on the above information, it is concluded
that the letter was transmitted via normal Swedish postal channels. The
letter is probably a “crank letter", most likely written by a Swede,
using a Swedish-keyboard typewriter and Swedish stationery.
