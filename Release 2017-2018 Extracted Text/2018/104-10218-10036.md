Action : Headquarters approval of Project LIHUFF es outlined
in this dispatch end separate cover attachments.

1. Reference advised the Mexico Station that Chief, WH and KUWOLF / ¢
start decided net to request approval of the LIHUFF Project as outlined in
HMMA~20931 dated 22 March 1963. The reasons for this decision were:

(a) that the Project would support a rightist conservative group |
in Mexico without adequate operational control and without
adequate control of the expenditure of KU-ARK funds; i

(b) shortage of funds for CA operations;

(c) thet the LIHUFF magazine 1s too conservative end too narrow in
interest to merit KUBARK support;

(a) that Headquarters hes not been sufficiently informed about the;
student activities to recommend a subsidy of US$8,000 per year.

Reference asked for Mexico Station reaction to Headquarters’ position and .”|
for details on how the group could be financed end guided under standards
more acceptable to Headquarters, |

2. Headquarters is correct regarding the right-wing conservative.
attitude of the group; and it is true that the Mexico Ststion vould probebly
never have complete operational control of the group. It is also true that!
funds once given to the group can no longer be controlled by KUBARK except |
/ ,@ through the influence of LIHUFF/1, Nevertheless, the LIEUFF group does _sond

3. The Mexico Station agrees that the LIHUFF magazine is conserva;
tive and “pro-capitalist". From the financial point of view, it is be har
that HIsS-2530, dated 15 August 1962, and HMqT-3023, dated 50 August 1962,. |
and MEXI-2246, dated 18 October 1962 be reviewed for"backsround on the manner _

narrow in interest to merit KUBARK support", Chief of Station, Mexico has
asked IDEN B and his company to pay this subsidy in the future, This
arrangement will begin on 1 January 1964, ‘The circulation of this magazine
is epproximately 2000 copies. It is definitely conservative, strongly
pro-private enterprise and anti-Socialist. In a mesting on 30 July 1965
with the Chief of Station and Michael C. Choaden, the Chier, MBFLNCR said,
"we do far too little propaganda of IDEN'A type; that is, that which is pro-
capitalist and strongly anti-Communist". He said this 15,000 pasos monthly
is less than it costs monthly for,us to put one officer abroad and thie is
far wider - far beyond what one more man could do", He asked -hat the Chief
of Station appeal to GALBOND to keep financing IDEN A.

4, As previously pointed out to Headquarters, IDEN C provides the
Station with a research facility not othervise available. ‘They are able to
place articles in nevspapers and magazines, sponsor lectures, and sponsor
research projects.

5. Manuel CALVILLO Alonso is an intellectual asset connected with
the LIHUFF organization. He is a source of positive intelligence on right~
wing political groups. He is the brother-in-law of Dr. Salvador NAVA
Martinez of San Luis Potos{, prominent eye surgeon and politician. CALVILIO
also knows the educational field better than any source of the Mexico Station.
He, additionally, provides the Station with background information on well-
mown leftists, He has just completed a book on "Penetration of Mexican’

Educational System by Communists". This manuscript hes been read by Chief,
HBFINCH Mexico, IDEN D, IDEN 4, pra Michael C. Choaden
and the Chief of Station, all o! ellent historical

ae penetrations by Communism into the Mexican educational system,

who has lived through the years cited (1930-1963) believes the

the book (which he says is factual and excellently documented)
“will be terrific". . HMMA-21976 transmitted a copy of this to Buencs Aires
with a request for publication. The timing of this publication is important
because of the impact it is expected to have on impending national elections
in Mexico.

6. Tke student activities of this group (IDEN 5) have been far ~
more effective than it would appear from Station reporting. LIMUFF/1 and
the Station are at fault for failing to keep Headquarters fully informed on
these activities. Headquerters (in reference) recomnended that instead of
@ flat subsidy for basic expenses for the student group, the Station provide
funds for specific activities, trips, demonstrations, etc. ‘This arrangement
is perfectly acceptable to the Mexico Station. Those activities which ere
financed by KUBARK will be coordinated by the Station CA staff. IDEN E
consists of 200 shock troops who are vigorously anti-Commmnist and campaign
actively against Communist and pro-Castro groups at the UNAM; the University
in Guadalajara, and the University in Puebla. Thies is an excellent channel
for action, for anti-Commnist propaganda and for pro-Free World propaganda.
They are willing to take direction from LIHUFF/2 who will take direction from
LIHUFF/1 (who is in contact with Chief of Station, Mexico). The group
publishes a weekly news organ (IDEN F) forwarded under separate cover. Also
by seperate attachment is a list of some of the activities of this group
during the past few months.

7. ‘In sumary, the Mexico Station requests that the LIHUFF Project
be approved for an expenditure of US$30,000 to be used for spot covert
action activities via the LIHUFF organization. Of this amount, US$6,000
will be used to pay ¢. monthly salary of US$500 to LIMUFF/1. The remaining
sum will be used for specific activities in coordination with other CA
activities of the Station.
