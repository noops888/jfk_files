,
1. Dr. Charles Bohrer recommezts (subject to Howard
Osborne's concurrence) that the tvs fellewing defectors
be added to the Brezhnev visit watch list:

a, Anatoliy GOLITIYN (AEL&2ZE)}. Delusions of
* grandeur; expected much more from ste U.S. Government than
he in fact received in terms of persezal recognition. Frus-
trated, reclusive. May take some actiea to “get even."

2. b. Yuri NOSSENKO (AEDONOR}. Not seriously neurotic,
aoe but because of the way in which he sas handled he has reason —
to be vengeful, and may take the Brezhnev visit as an oppor-
tunity to embarrass us,

oA ry

1. Howard Osborn's recommendations for the Brezhnev
“watch list":

a. Delete NOSSENKO. He's happily rehabilitated,
well disposed toward CIA and the USG, well adjusted. Not
a threat.

b. GOLENIEWSKI, Absolutely nutty. Put him at

. the top of the list. He hates ‘the Soviet Government because

it's depriving him of the Romanov crown jewels.

WY ¢. Anatoliy GOLITZYN. Agree with Bohrer. Put
him on the list.
