It is not clear to the Bureau from wording in re
Mexico City airtel whether data furnished by Mexican Federal
Security Police can be further disseminated, especially to
the Internal Security Division of the Department which requested
this investigation and to the Department of State with which the
Department of Justice would, by necessity, have to discuss the
ease to arrange for appropriate testimony of Mexican witnesses.
It appears that restrictions placed by Mexican Federal Security
Police in furnishing data to Legat, Mexico “solely for information"
was possibly to emphasize the fact that the data could not be
used as evidence without proper arrangements made through $
diplomatic channels (¢

When the above data (which is definitely most perti-
nent to the current investigation) is submitted in letterhead
memorandum, clarify above in cover pages thereto and specifically
advise what the Internal Security Division of the Department can
be told to assist in gathering evidence and otherwise preparing

its case for possible prosecution. ©

recovered, by Mexican authorities appear on the Munitions Controy

In April, 1967, Fiorini and two cogpanions proceeded to Mexico with
explosives to carry out bombing. (Bombing, however, was not carried
out and explosives were buried in Mexico which were recovered by
Mexican authorities based on data furnished by one of the two
individuals who was with Piorini. Legat, Mexico, has obtained

- &8 4s already Known, the Secretary of the Government,
through the (Mexican) Federal Security Police (D.F.8.), requested
the cooperation of the technical personnel of this Department in
the finding, identifying and destruction of some “bonbs," detonatoys
and other devices which, according to information obtained by the
D.P.S8., had been brought into the country and buried at a spot

near the Mante-C.. Victoria road, between kilometers 643 and 644.

ir. becehrotat of the Zone and Spot Where the Ezplosives Were
Found. :

As a result of the above request, the undersigned and
Captain Olmos, accompanied by two agents of the D.Fi:8., went
immediately to Ciudad Mante, Tamaulipas, and arrived at said
plaza at 3:20 A. M., May &, 1967.

On the same day, at 8:00 A. M., we went to the indicate
spot, between kilometers G43 and 644, for the purpose of determining -
the indicated gone where, according to the information, was located
the spot where the explosives had been buried.

At the end of four hours, we succeeded in finding the
exact spot where the explosives had been buried, in a promontory
bordering the left side of the road and approximately 15 meters
from the road, between kilometers 642 and 643. The location is
shown on Photographs No. 1 and 2.

1) A "bomb" or a double explosive charge, wrapped
in sections of a tire inner tube, and fastened by adhesive tape.
Photographs 3 and 4. .

2) Four magnets, consisting of coiled spools
especially positioned, in pairs, to fasten each of the explosive
charges to metallic parts. Photographs 5 and 6. The magnets,
like the charges, were found wrapped in sections of an inner tube

3) The detonators for the explosive charges. These
were found wrapped in a plastic bag. Photograph No. 7

4) The vemnants of anvexplosive charge. It is
thought that farmers in the area accidently discovered it and,
in attempting to see its contents, destroyed it completely. Phot
graph No. 8. —
O£ these «remnants, the following were recovered “
separately: - :

a) The explosive material.

: b) Fragments of a container, a blue plastic
tape, labels from the factory which manufactured the explosive,
remains of newspapers, pieces ef plywood and pieces of a mesh,
plastic cloth. Photograph No. 9.

Iv. Identification of the Explosive Material. Visual
Examination.

Once all the items in the area had been unearthed, we
proceeded to examine them in detail in order to attempt to identif;
them and ascertain as to what condition they were in so as to
destxoy them, should conditions warrant it. : :

a) The Explosive Charge ~ Rectangular in shape with
the following approximate dimensions: 30 x 20 x 7 centimeters.
The charge consists of a biock of explosive covered with 4 solid,
putty-like, plastic material, the entire surface of which ws
covered with black insulation tape. At one of its edges, 2 plugs
for an iron pipe of 3/4 inch diameter were found. These are
fastened separately by a screw to lengths of galvanized iron pipe
of the same diameter and approximately 15 centimeters long. The
pipes are located inside the explosive charge and serve; as a
lodging for the detonators. Two metallic rods of 7 millimeters
in diameter and 10 centimeters long extend along the longitudinal
axis of the charge. They have screws at the ends which serve to
fasten them to the spools.

Una vez que se hubieron desenterrado todos los elemen-~
tos que se hallaron en la zona, se procedié a examinarlos de
coeertenida y cuidadosamente para tratar de identificarlos, y ver
en que condiciones se encontraban, para que en su caso, pro~

ceder a su destruccidén.

Laden Carga explosiva. De forma rectangular, con las me-
' @idas aproximadas siguientes: 30 x 20 x 7 cms. Es-
t& hecha de un block de explosivo recubierta por —-
un material de pasta sélido, reforzada en todo su-
superficie, con cinta de aislar, color negro. En -
uno de sus cantos, se encuentran dos tapones pura
tubo de hierro de 3/4", los que se fijan por medio
de rosca, a sendos pedazos de tubo de hiezro galva
nizado. del mismo didmetro y como de 15 cmst. de
c - Llongitud los que se encuentran dentro de la curg
Fy “:i « explosiva, y sirven como alojamiento a los detona-
dores. Segin el eje longitudinal de la carga, so
bresalen unas varillas metdlicas de 7 mm. de did.
*, metro y de unos 10 ems. de longitud, roscadas en-
_ Bus extremos que sirven para sujetarla a las bobi-
nag que se encontraron.

El explosivo, que contiene, es una masa de co--
lor blanco, de consistencia pldstica, y desconoci-
do, en lo que se refiere e sus caracteristicas y -
potencia.Serd necesario llevar a cabo los anélisis
-correspondientes para determinar su clase y tipo.

: Se comprovddé que la carga explosiva, no estaba —

«,organizada ni preparada para funcionar, ya que no=
contenfa, los elementos de iniciacidén, comunica---

‘cidn y multiplicacién para ser detonadu. Fotogra--
fia No. 10.

b).= Bobinas-imanes o "calamitags". Estas que son cuatro,
estan constituideas por una bobina de aproximademen
te 3" x 2" x 1", teniendo en suse extremos dos pla-
placas metélicas sujetas por unas tuercas.,in es--
