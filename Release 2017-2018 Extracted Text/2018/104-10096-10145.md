CIA OPERATIONS AGAINST CUBA PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION
OF PRESIDENT JOHN F.~ KENNEDY ON 23 NOVEMBER 1963 -

A. “INTRODUCTION

1. Agency planning and operations directed at. Cuba during the latter
part of 1959, 1960 and early 1961 were almost totally devoted to the
development of the paramilitary operation which culminated in the Bay of
Pigs invasion on 17 April 1961. During this period, major efforts were
devoted to training a paramilitary force, formation of a Cuban exile
organization in Miami to direct opposition activities and to provide
future Cuban leadership and a propaganda campaign designed to rally op-
position to Castro in Cuba and élsewhere in Latin America. |

2. Some of the actions initiated during 1960-61 continued following
the defeat of the Agency supported Cuban brigade. For example, prior to
the break in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the U.S. on 3 January
1961, CIA maintained a Station in Havana. This Station recruited and
trained intelligence agents and procured and cached communications
equipment to form a staybehind net to provide intelligence on Cuba
following the break in diplomatic relations. Following the Bay of Pigs
defeat, this net continued to function providing information on Cuba

via radio communication and Latin American diplomatic pouches. Radio

Swan is another example of an operation which continued after the Bay of
Pigs. It was established in the Spring of 1960 as a component of the
anti-Castro propaganda campaign. [It continued in this role until its
termination in 1968.

3. Following the Bay of Pigs and in response to administration
urgings. to do something about Castro, CIA established a large Station
in Miami in September 1961 to continue operations against Cuba. The
operations described below were developed and run by the Miami Station;
many of them were still in the developmental stage at the time of
President Kennedy's assassination.

4. The Station initiated three major classes of activities:
intelligence collection/espionage, covert action/propaganda, and
infiltration/exfiltration actions. It should be noted that there was
no clear delineation between these activities, e.g., an exile organi-
zation primarily engaged in propaganda on the Agency's behalf might
also provide positive intelligence information from interrogation of
an exile or provide candidates for an infiltration team to perform
sabotage. It should also be noted that infiltration/exfiltration ac-
tions were undertaken for a variety of purposes such as espionage,
sabotage and to assist defectors. Aside fron intelligence collection,

all of the remaining activities would constitute forms of covert action.

B. COVERT ACTION/PROPAGANDA

1. Agency Supported Cuban Exile Organizations:
CIA provided monetary support and guidance to a number of Cuban .

exile organizations in the Miami area who disseminated anti-Castro propa-
ganda. Some of these organizations came into existence through Cuban
exile initiative, but they became largely dependent on CIA to carry on
their activities.

a. Directorio Magisterial Revolucionario (DMR):

‘An exile teachers organization in which CIA became interested
in early 1961. DMR produced a bulletin (Magisterio Cubano Libre) which
was mailed to 18 Latin American countries, to DMR members and to press and
radio organizations in the U.S. Radio programs directed at Cuba were pre-
pared and broadcast over station WIE, in Miami. Copies of these programs
were sent to various Latin American countries and were broadcast over 88
different stations. The DMR also produced seven TV programs which were
broadcast over Channel 2 in Miami. The theme of DMR propaganda was the
destruction of the Cuban educational system by Castro. The head of DMR
attended the National Education Association meeting in 1962, gave a talk
at the meeting and was instrumental in having a resolution. approved con-
demning the Castro regime. By the end of 1962, the DMR was mailing out
350,000 booklets and pamphlets a year to various Latin countries and

France.

b. Union Deportiva de Cuba Libre (UDCL):

A sports ortented organization established by CIA in October
1962. Led by a well known Cuban sports figure and a prominent Cuban
sports writer. Purpose of UDCL was to expose Cuban abuse of international
sporting events for political propaganda purposes. UDCL leaders attended
the IX Central American and Caribbean Games at Kingston, Jamaica in August
1962, disseminated anti-Castro propaganda and were in part responsible for
the defection of ten Cuban athletes. A similar operation was launched at
the II Ibero-American Games at Madrid in October 1962 with less success.
Propaganda was distributed and two defections were induced. Pamphlets
were also distributed at the IV Panamerican Games at Sao Paulo, Brazil in
January 1963: No defections were induced. In 1963, the UDCL is credited

with obtaining a temporary suspension of Cuba from Olympic competition

and changing the site of the XVI Amateur Baseball World Championship from
Cuba to another country.

c. Comite DeOrganizaceones Juveniles Cubanas in el Exilio (COJCE):
A youth organization headed by a former Cuban Boy Scout leader.

CIA began support to this organization in December 1962. Starting in July
1963, COJCE published a monthly bulletin with a distribution of several
thousand copies to Latin American and European youth contacts. Purpose of
bulletin was to furnish information on the effect of Castro-Communist

policies-on Cuban youth.

d. Directorio Revolucionario. Estudiantil (DRE);

Led by several former Cuban student leaders. CIA support to
the DRE started prior to the Bay of Pigs. The DRE was primarily a para-
military organization and prior to April 1961,°21 DRE members were trained
and infiltrated into Cuba to create resistance and guerrilla units. This
DRE apparatus was destroyed in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs. Subse-
quent paramilitary operations also ended in failure and CIA withdrew its

_ paramilitary support in December 1961. In January 1962, the DRE turned
to hemispheric propaganda operations. DRE sponsored students were placed
‘in Latin American universities where they carried on anti-Castro activi-
ties. This so-called student project also engaged in such activities as
drumming up support for the U.S. position at the 1962 Punto del Este Con-
ference and carrying out successful operations at the Helsinki Youth
Festival in May 1962. Starting in 1962, the DRE began broadcasts over
#NY shortwave radio station WRUL six days a week and Miami radio station
WMIE once a week. The DRE also published an international. bulletin which
was mailed to contacts throughout the hemisphere and a pony edition of
4,800 copies was mailed into Cuba.

e. Frente Obero Revolucionario Democratico Cubano (FORDC):

Established by CIA in October 1960 as a rallying point for

middle and upper echelon trade unionists in exile. Led by former Cuban

labor leaders, FORDC published a weekly circular letter which was mailed
to labor organizations throughout.Latin America, Prior to’ 1961, FORDC
sponsored a daily program over Radio Americas (Radio Swan). Starting in
December 1961, FORDC broadcast a daily program over station WMIE. In
addition to published and radio propaganda; groups of FORDC leaders were
sent on trips throughout Latin America to maintain contact with hemi-
sphere labor leaders and to sample attitudes toward Castro. FORDC also
maintained contact with international labor organizations.
f. Unidad Revolucionaria (UR):

Originally established in Cuba ‘in December 1960 as a clan-
destine resistance movement. Its leadership was largely put to death or
imprisoned as a result of the Bay of Pigs. The organization was re-
established in Miami in August 1962 with CIA support. A paramilitary
arm was established in April 1963, but no effective paramilitary action
was ever carried out. Starting in March 1963, UR sponsored a daily
radio program over WMIE targetted at Cuban farmers and another daily
program exposing Cuban internal security service activities. In July
1963, UR initiated a shortwave broadcast from station WRUL, New York.
The UR utilized nonobjective, lurid propaganda themes. The UR was also
a prolific producer of propaganda pamphlets. During 1963-64, 1,442,500

items were mailed to Cuba and other Latin American countries. Ona

weekly basis the UR published a list of free world ships visiting Cuba.
This was consistently picked up by the Associated Press and Agence
France Presse. Throughout its history, the UR was wracked with internal
bickerings and power grabs which detracted from its ‘impact.

2. Agency Supported Individuals:

Aside from utilizing various exile organizations for propaganda
purposes, CIA also supported several prominent extles who prepared propa-
ganda materials. Zig Zag Libre was a successful satire magazine in Cuba
prior to the Castro regime.’ The Agency supported its former editor who
Published an edition for mailing into Cuba. In the 1963 period it was
considered an effective weapon for ridiculing Castro. CIA also supported
a former prominent student leader, and one of the former directors of
Prensa Libre, a leading Havana newspaper. These individuals produced
daily radio programs for Radio Swan and prepared propaganda materials
for publication. These individual efforts tended to be more effective
and to receive better audience response from Cuba than the organizational
broadcasts described above.

3. Agencia de Informaciones Periodesticas (AIP): -

AIP was a news information service Financed by CIA. Agency

sponsorship was an open secret. It was designed to fill the gap in

coverage by the regular news media. It was accepted in the hemisphere

as an accurate and objective reporter of events: It prepared four news
bulletins a week which were distributed to 1200 Latin American news
outlets and prepared radio ‘tapes based on the bulletins which were dis-
tributed to hemisphere radio stations.

4. Radio Americas (Radio Swan):

An Agency-financed radio stattons the transmitter was located on
Swan Island with broadcast studios in New York initially and later. Miami.
Started broadcasting in mid=1960 with entertainment programs purchased
from Pan American Broadcasting interspersed with news programs and propa-
ganda. CIA sponsorship was an open secret. Its image and credibility
was smudged considerably as a result.of its use in the Bay of Pigs opera-
tion. Most audience. response was received from Caribbean countries out-
side of Cuba.

5. Mailing Operation:

Most propaganda mailing operations were directed to Latif American
countries outside of Cuba. This project, initiated in 1963, was designed
as a mass mailing operation into Cuba to encourage subtle sabotage, re-
sistance and harassment. Utilizing names and addresses from Cuban tele-
phone books, letters with fictitious return addresses were mailed to
Cuba from various Latin American countries and by insertion into inter-

national mail transiting the U.S. From refugee debriefings, it is known

that some of this mail was delivered, but like most of the operations de-
scribed in this section, it is unknown if the Program was effective in

increasing Cuban resistance.

C.° INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION/ESPTONAGE
"1. Refugee and Defector Exploitation:

Cuban refugees were entering the United States at the rate of 1700
per week during 1961-62. The Immigration. and Naturalization Service (T&NS)
recorded basic biographic data on all incoming refugees. Cards, containing
this data, were provided to the Miamt Station to conduct a file check for
counterintelligence purposes. In reviewing the cards, the Station identi-

: fied refugees who might be used for operational purposes and arranged

interviews. which, frequently, also provided positive intelligence infor-
mation.

CIA's Domestic Contact Division (DCO) had primary responsibility-
for obtaining positive intelligence information from refugees. DCD inter-
viewed refugees of positive intelligence interest at the Caribbean Admis-
sions Center (CAC) in Opa-Locka. These interviews were documented in
Preliminary Information Reports (PIRs) which were provided to the Intel-
ligence Community and to the Miamt Station for review to obtain opera-
tional leads.

Prior to the Cuban Missile crisis in October 1962, the flow of

refugees was large, and it was relatively easy to obtain information on
current events in Cuba and Cuban exiles that could be utilized opera-
tionally. Following the crisis, the flow of refugees decreased signifi-
cantly. As a result, the Station established a section to exploit :
refugees more intensively, to centralize files on refugees, and to pre-
pare studies on extle groups operating in the U.S.

2. Anonymous Organization Group:

During 1960-63, this Group consisted of between 50 to 100: Cuban
exiles who constituted a structured intelligence support group for the
Station. It performed a variety of functions for the Station, and it
was the Station's prime source of information on Cuban exile activities.
It is considered the single most valuable operational activity under-
taken by the Station. In summary, this Group:

re Infiltrated exile groups and reported on their
activities.

b. Maintained extensive files on Cuban exiles, exile
groups and Cuban Government personalities.

c. . Monitored Cuban radio broadcasts ‘and summarized
content.

d. Produced intelligence reports and special studfes.

e. Debriefed refugees.

f. Recruited infiltration agents.

3. Intelligence Net:

In mid-1962, the Agency recruited a former Cuban politician to
establish an agent net in Cuba. This individual recruited a member of
the presidential entourage, a Cuban working in a foreign consul, and a
third individual. These individuals recruited an extensive net of 150
subagents and informants which was very productive in reporting informa-
tion of intelligence interest via the diplomatic pouch of the foreign
consul. The high living and immoral behavior of one of the principe”
attracted the attention of the Cuban security service. This individual
was arrested and interrogated prior to Christmas 1963 resulting in the
arrest and conviction on espionage charges of all of the members of the
net.

of the oppressed Cuban people, but on behalf of the Communist movement.

D. _INFILTRATION/EXFILTRATION OPERATIONS

As noted earlier, infiltration/exfiltration operations, which started
in mid-1962, were undertaken for a variety of purposes, such as:
a. Emplace arms and communications caches for use by agents and
resistance groups.
b. Infiltrate agents to recruit agents for espionage purposes.
c. Exfiltrate agents who had completed their missions. or for
further training, or to obtain reporting.
d. Exfiltrate significant political defectors.
e. Commit acts of sabotage.
Each of these operations were approved by the Special Group or its succes-
sor, the 303 Committee. They were a major preoccupation of the Miami
Station and large amounts of money and manpower were devoted to them.
They were executed with varying degrees of success and were frequently
aborted because they encountered resistance from Cuban security forces
or rendezvous were missed. e
These operations were supported by a small maritime force which, in
1963, consisted of three mother ships and six smaller vessels. During

1963, 88 operations were planned of which 15 were cancelled. Of the

operations carried out, four involved sabotage and ten others encountered
contact with Cuban forces. Thus, during 1963, the Castro Government was
aware of at least 14 operations involving tnfiltration of Cuban coasts and
harbors, and it would be logically assumed that the U.S. had a hand in ,
these actions. ;

During 1963, a CIA trained exile paramilitary group committed two acts
of sabotage which inflicted some damage, caused a great deal of commotion
and attracted a lot of publicity. On 31 August 1963, this group attempted
to destroy a POL dump in Casildo Harbor using an 8imm mortar and a 75mm
recoilleFs rifle. Unknown to the team, the Harbor was under an air de~
fense alert at the time. Shortly after opening fire, the team came under
heavy enemy fire. The team inflicted some damage on the POL dump, and
hastily departed in two small boats. This. attack was reported in the
Cuban press.

On 30 September 1963, this group conducted a commando raid against a
large. sawmill on the coast of Oriente Province. The sawnill was destroyed
and no enemy opposition was encountered. “The mil] was a main producer of
railroad ties. Its loss was felt, and noted in a Castro speech, when a
hurricane destroyed most of the railroad's lines in part of Cuba several

weeks later.
