Current Overall Evaluation

The general trend appears slightly favorable, with the GVN continuing

to improve its military, and to a limited extent, its political and econc-

nic position. Basic problems are being eroded but quick and decisive

action 1s rare.. There were no major breakthroughs or important victories

and nors appear likely in the lumdiate future. The Viet Cong show no

weakening in strength or deternination despite reportedly heavy losses.

On the military side, Operations Binh Minh and Hal Yen continued

well, Viet Cong casualties were up and their activities down (there is

an unconfined news report that a major battle took place July 3, however,

in which the VC defeated a regular army battalion)

This may be due to

raorganization and woather rather than OVN successes.

The Vi took several

good but idnor stops to increase popular support for the war affort, and

several rural arcial and econonic programs moved ahead significantly. On

the international front, there were some favorable responses to our efforts

to set up an aid coordinating group of donor nations. Economie conditione

Improved somewhat, with stable prices, credit a little less tight, consu

mer goods sales and tax collections up, and rice deliveries contimed good.

Fearing that the prospective lam settlement w1ll facilitate Viet Cong

activities and that it may presage a U. S. move to neutralize Viet-Nam it-

self, the OVN has made difficulties at Ceneva over several issues and

threatens to boycott the conference.

President Kennedy has sent Dien a

personal letter stressing the importance we attach to a laos settlement

and our determination to continue to help Viet Nam defend Itself. There

is no response as yet.

Progress on Action Program

1. VC Activity

Viet Cong activity continued at a relatively low level, with armed

attacks falling to the lovest point over & year, 60, for the period 20-27

June and rising oaly slightly to 75 for the period June 27 - July 4. The

lack of VC aggressivess is likely due to the rainy season and their

efforts to regroup in order to counter the improved mobility and perfor

mance of the GIN forces.

Observing that this appears to be a period o

VC reorganization and assimilation of recent infiltrators, COMUSMACV 2

but this Information 1s unconfirned and there are no reports of infilt

tion since.

Is spite of reduced VC activity, VC casualties vere high and included

some main force personnel. For the period 20-27 June the VC suffered a

reported increase of casualties of almost 25 per cent over the previous

reporting period. Killed in action for the two week period were 365 vo

and 14l friendly forces.

Reports continua to indieste a critical VC shortage of medical supplies.

Inconfired reports raise the possibility that the YC are attaining an snti-

aircraft capability.

(Following itens are keyed to the Viet-Nam draft action program of

J02l5 3)

2. Strengthen popular support. The CVN took several steps to generate

more popular support in the last two reeks. These include the July 7 release

of 794 prisoners in connection aith the celebration of the "double seven"

holiday (anniversary of Dien's coning to pover), a stepped-up drive to root

out lo4 level corruption and abuse of power by GVY officials, and a Presiden-

tially proposed amendment to the Constitution permitting the questioning of

Cabinet Ministers both by Coumittees of the National Assembly and by the

National Assembly 10 plenary session. The prisoners released may include

leading oppositionist Phan Quang Dan, uno has been in prison since his par-

ticipation in the atteupted 1960 coup. We have urged the last item on Dien

in the past in an effort to increase the powers and prestige of the National

Assembly.

Another favorable develpment Is increased emphasig on working with and

for the people in the current training progran for strategic hanlet cadres.

Ngo dinh Nhu (President's brother in charge of the strategie hanler program)

is concerned that the program win genuine popular support.

He favors the

election of hanlet officials by secret ballot inatead of by custonary shost

of haris. This is now being done in some hamlets.

4. Seek International Support

(s) Cembodian Ralations. The GN replied milaly to the Cambodian

note concerning

the ARIN border Incursions of June 16 but did not apologize

or offer indemnities. The note insists that all precautions sere taken to

avoid crossing the poorly marked frontier, admits that in spite of these pre-

cautions the frontier may have been violated, points out thet any such inad-

vertent crossing was not motivated by hostility toward Cambodia, denies the

arrest of or harn to Canbudian inhabitants, and proposes a mixed border con-

tan? cormittee to study frontier incidents and provide for future border

cooperation.

Another source of GVi-RKO friction, disputed coastal islando:

was the subject of an exchange of notes which threatened to stir up further

troible betwen Cambolla and Vie:-Nan.

(b) Third Country aid.

The United States has suggested &

Saigon, and possibly a later Washington neeting of donor country repre-

sentatives to coordinate aid to Viet Nam. The intention is to stimulate

more third country ald 1f possible, and to make sure that current third

country contributions are being effectively applied. To date, Australla

and New Zealand have indicated willingness to participate In such meetings,

Gorany will take part in informal Saigon meetings but would not attend

any fornal Washington gathering, and the Japanese are "proceeding with

caution" because of the expressed fear that too close identification

with the U.S. will open up japanese technicians in Viet-Nam to Viet Cong

reprisals. Canada has declined to participate because of its membership

on the ICC. The Belgians. French, Italians and the UK have not yet

responded.

Negotiations for the integration of Australian trainers into

our MAAG appear near completion. The GVN has indicated its willingness to

receive a New Zealand medical teem at any time and the details are being

worked out with Wellington and Saigon.

10. MIlltary Civic Action

The 31st Engineer Battalion assisted the local population at

Cheo Reo in Pleiku Province in the construction of a Buddhist temple.

In addition to the 150, 000 copies of a news sheet distributed weekly by

soldiers to the local civilian population, 35,000 copies of the sheet

were also air dropped.

12. Develop and Implement Mutually Agreed Plans

Operations Binh Minh and Hal Yen. Saigon reports both clear-

and-hold operations continuing to make progress without serious VC reaction.

Increased contact with the VC is reported in the Hai Yen area, however, as

the military move into ve territory.

Hamlet Councils have been elected in the Hai Yen area, but the

Embassy notes a serious problem in the fact that a hamlet Council member

receives only 300 piasters (about $4.00) per month for what is theoreti

cally a full time job.

In Operation Binh Minh, an effort will be made to

induce the people to move voluntarily into the fourth village to be set

up there.

The plan calls for extensive propaganda and explanations in

advance of the move. establishment of military control over the area so

that the people will be free to move voluntarily, and up to 15 days to

accomplish the move itself (previous regrouping actions allowed only a

very short period for the physical move).

Montagnards. Latest information developed as a result of joint

surreys indicates the Montagnard situstion is more a long term problem

than an emergency. There hes in fact been a movement of some 17,000 Mon

tagnard as a reaction to VC pressures, and this movement will probably

continue, particularly if the OVN provides adequate food and security.

Almost all Montagnard refugees are at least temporarily resettled and re-

ceiving minimum food, shelter and security.

The Embassy connents that while this information somewhet reduces

the urgency of the problem, it does not change the problen'a magnitude or

importance. Difficulties steming from the absence of a well directed,

national Montagnard relief program, linited relief resources, and the Viet-

namese prejudice against the Montagnard continue. But the principal and

most encouraging aspect is the fact that the Montagnard have fled the VC

pressures and more may do so.

Strategic Hamlet Program. The second ten day training course for

490 strategie hanlet cadres was Inaugurated by Ngo dinh Nau in Saigon July 2.

Future Plans. According to CAS,

15. Provide Increased Technical Assistance.

Village Radios. As of July h, 817 of the planned 2500 village

radios were installed and operating. Tests of radios for use on trains

were started.

Defoliation. The Embassy has proposed a test of the effectiveness

of defoliants against VC food patches in the mountainous area of Operation

Governor Harriman opposes the use of defoliants on food crops be-

cause of the effect on Asian opinion. Deeision and action will be delayed

until the Governor's return from Geneva.

20. Integrate Economic Measures with Counterinsurgency Effort.

Apricultural Extension. A pilot training program for agricultural

efforts associated with counterinsurgency plans opened July 3 in Qui Whon.

One hundred farmers will study farming and stock raising methods for one

month, Including the use of fertilizers and pesticides.

Provincial Hospitaly. Construction of four of the 25 planned

hospital surgical suites began on schedule.

Anti-Rat Program. The USOM-supported rat destruction campaign was

carried out In ten northern provinces June 12-22, resulting in the destruction

of an estimated 15-20 million rats or 20,000 per village.

25. Publicize the War Within Viet-Nan and Internationally.

Viet-Nam Photo Service. USIS Saigon is sending out a weekly packet

of photos designed to enlist third country interest and support for the GVN

var effort. Eight posts have reported favorably on the effort, imlicating

no difficulty in placing the photos in leading newspspers.

28. Establish Network of USIS Sub-posts.

The GN has agreed to the establishment of virtually any number

ut USIS sub-posts throughout the country. Negotiations on locations and

physical arrangements are underway.

Current Situation evaluatzon

The RIG has accepted the International Court decision avarding the

disputed Phra Viharn Temple to Cambodia. That delegates attended the

Geneva Conference on laos, which reconvened on July 2, but the RTG has

not yet announced its intention to attend the next meeting of the SEATO

Council of Representatives in mid-July.

On July? the US began the redeployment of 1, 000 Marines from the

Third Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Udorn. Possible Thai concern over

this move was lessened by our informing them at the same time of a US

financed progran to improve logistic facilities in Thailand (see below).

On June 29 police arrested one suspected Communist in Chiengrat and

one in Larpang, both in the North of Thalland. The Thai press reporta

that subversive documents were confiscated at both locations.

According

to unconfirmed recorts these documents originated from

ingequipment. Ine Thai have agreed to the proposal in principle although

LAOS

Current Situation Evaluation

The principal remaining issues before the Geneva Conference, Including

SEATO, having. been resolved, It is anticipated that the new Accords way be

signed next week.

There is nevertheless one serious stumbling block, which

endangers the satisfactory conclusion of the Conference, 1.e., the possible

refusal of the OVN to sign. The OVN's position stems from its belief that

so many concessions have been made to the Comunists that the security of

SVN Is gravely threatened. We are, however, hopefal that Diem will still

be persuaded that we have achieved the best

obtainable compromise for Laos

and that we stand firm on our commitments to SVN.

ProgreSS on Action PrOßFEN

There has been little progress on our action program. We are con

centrating at present on the following problems:

1. Econonic Assistance. Flaboration of our future aid to Laos awaits

the visit of Souvanna Phouma to Washington, tentatively scheduled for

July 25-27. In the meantime, we seak to spread the burden of providing

Souvanna with the material assistance he requires 'by enlisting contribu

tions from other Free World nations.

2. RIG Diplomatic Relations.

The RIG's decision to recognize 5 bloc

countries and accept an exchange of Ambassadors poses a major problem with

respect to the GVN. CRC, Federal Republic of Germany and the ROK. Further

action by the RG 13 deferred until Souvanna's return to laos.

In the in

terim we are attempting to assist the pro-Western countries involved in

establishing or maintaining satisfactory representation in Laos.

3. ICC. We have asked our Geneva delegation to request the ICC to

prepare a detailed budget and list of equipment needs so that we wil be

prepared to meet quickly our share of the roguirements. With regard to

the essential heavy equipment - helicopters and light aircraft - we are

taking steps to make 1t lmediately available to the ICC.

BURMA

Current Situation Evaluation

The Internal situation remains unstable. This fact was highlighted

by incidents on July 7 and 8 when student denonstrations led by pro-

Cornist organizations were ruthlessly repressed by the police and army.

Ne Win regime and to a rift between the regime and the opportunistic

political supporters.

Internal security conditions are apparently continuing to deteriorate,

though not dramatically. A special Goverment amnesty offer expired June 10

without producing significant response from the insurgents.

Progress on Action Program

1. Political

It has been confirmed that Brigadier Pin Pe of the Undon Revolutionary

Ceancil will come to Washington for medical treatment as planned probably

in late July, although precise dates have not been determined.

2. Economic (AID)

No new developments.

3. Military

a. The Burmese are ready formally to accept the FY 1962 military

"gales" program. State and DOD have agreed to accelerate deliveries of M2

This action will also, hopefully, earn some political credit

b. Embassy Rangoon has confirmed that United States training

CAMBODIA

Current Situation Evaluation

Cambodia's differences with neighboring Thailand and South VietNam

continne,

but they have so far not significanty affected the presently

generally satisfactory relations between the United States md Cambodia.

Thai moves concerning Preah Vihear temple are being watched closely, and

it appears likely that if the arnounced decision to respect the World

Court's award is not implemented by September the matter may be brought

by Cambodia to the attention of the UNGA.. The dispute between Cambodia

and Viet-Nam over the ownership of islands off the Cambodian shore has come

to the fore again, with the GN rejecting a Cambodian protest against Vietna

mese naval movements near them on the grounds that they belong to Viet-Nam.

Organization of a new Cabinet has been postponed pending religious rites

celebrating the World Court decision.. New evidence of anti-Sihanouk plotting

in Bangkok has developed.

Progress on Action Program

RKG-GVN Border Commission (Pol. 8). The GWN reply to the RiG's proo

test against. the June It border VIolations is not entirely satisfactory, but

Phnom Penh believes it may allow progress on the border conmission proposal

and has raised this possibility with the Foreign Ministry.

2. Force Increase (MIl. 1). The initial reaction of the RKG to approval

of the request for a force increase of 3,281, for MAP support only, 1o one of

disappointment that military budget support was not included.

3. New Aircraft (Kl. 5). Four I-28 aircraft, first increment of si-

teen, have arrived in Cambodia. Formal turnover awaits the arrival of
