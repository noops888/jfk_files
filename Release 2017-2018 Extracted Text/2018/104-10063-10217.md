day tour, Fuller spoke with leaders of various liberation

fronts in southern Africa who advised him of the need for

support by black people in the United States in the form of

funds and medical supplies as well as homogeneous political

people in the Americas (the United States, Canada and the

Caribbean) to demonstrate their solidarity with the libera-

tion movements in Africa.

Religious Foundation for Community Organizations (IFCO) of

to aid churches in allocating their funds to mutual-interest

projects of the various denominations. IFCO has also had

preparations for the 27 May demonstrations in Canada include

extensive press coverage in Contrast, a newspaper for the

black community in Canada, Black Student Union and United

Negro Improvement Association have sponsored social activ

ities to raise funds. Organizational meetings of the African

Liberation Day Steering Committee are held weekly. The 27

May demonstrations will include marches past the selected

and cultural performances by New York poets. Walter Rodney

conditions and firm police control are a deterrent to any or-

ganized activity on the part of black extremists.
