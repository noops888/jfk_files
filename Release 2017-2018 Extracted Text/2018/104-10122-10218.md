7. The pitch was made to Roselli on 14 Septermber 1960 at

Two articles appeared in the Chicago press,
one on 16 August 1963, and one on 20 August 1343,
that suggested Sam was working with the Agency.

The first article appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times: :

written by staff writer,’Sandy Smith, and had as ics

headline: CIA Sought Giancana Help for Cuba Spying. _

It relates that the Agency reportedly was in touch
with Sam in 1959 and requested that he assist them
in obtaining intelligence out of Cuba. it also men-
tioned the Las Yegds wiretap, which the article
claimed was handled by a "Florida investigative
organization." It farther went on to state that,
upon inquiry of this organization, they stated the _
tap was placed at the request of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. The other article appeared.in the
Chicago Daily News, authored by Columnist Tony
W zel, and commented that during March 1952,
Sam confronted an FBI Agent who was shadowing
him and said, '‘Vhy don't you fellows leave me
alone? I'm one of you!" Sam allegedly stated that,

17. Roselli was introduced to James P, S'Coenneil, af this

was identified to him as an employee of Robert A
“u, Associates. Over the several months of ciose contact be- :

en these two individuals, Roselli began to speculate as to
O'Connell's true employer and, at one point, stated that he was
convinced he was employed by. the CLA, and thai the project was
sponsored by the Agency. He hastened to state that he was not

18, In May 1962, because of Mr. O'Connell's 23sigament
to an overseas post, it was decided to turn Roselli over to
Mr. William Earvey, who was at that time Chief, Task Force. W.
Harvey was introduced as William. Walker, It is net known whether
Roselli ever became aware of Harvey's true name.
