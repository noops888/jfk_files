8 April 19641121

Dear Carlos,

(rasancos) and I are vriting this letter since we have not:

received an answer to the preytous one

-As I told you to the first letter, 4 Man la Spain for about

I0 days but an back here again.

As I told you on my arrival, I have several things to

talk over with you; and tl'1 stay on In Paris now, it's solely

because I'= waiting for you; the cost of living here is very high

Indeed so, please, 1f it's

possible I would like to have you

• "hop" over here, because I am not able to settle several matters

until I afscuss them with you; I will explain them.

Furthermore, Rolando wrote to ask me whether I had spoken

to you and I don't want to answer him until after we talk.

O6 " don't know whether you are aware that the "öld one"

(Irasanco'9) father) has left Cuba and is now in Madrid trying to

obtain permission to go to the United States. My ex-wife and the

children are in Barcelona with one of my uncles who lives there.

They are also trying. to get permission to go to the USA.

I wrote "ex-wife" above, but I don't know whether you

have heard that I am getting a divorce and remarrying, possibly

here in Paris but if not then in Spain. The woman whom I am going

to marry is here in Paris with me:

You know her -- (Sonia Perla 06

(G11) from the (Rivera) Do you remember?

After getting murried, I am thinking of going back to .

Cuba iith her, but this depends on several factors that i will digcuss

with. you

As I told you when we last spoke, the message I have for

you is not urgent but, I repeat, it is very important; two months

have already gone by, and there will be some additional delay

(ln sending the answer) even alter ve do talk, so I think it would

be best to settle this matter as soon as possible.

Well, Carlos, without anything further, and in the hope

of seeing you soon.

Un Suerte abrazo (a big hug)

fron your friend
