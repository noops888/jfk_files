MADE

IT CLEAR THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM TALKING TO

AMERICANS, AND NAMED C/O'S DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP WHOM HE HAD

MET THROUGH J/1.

3.

DURING THE CONVERSATION, J/1 SAID HE HEARD AN AUDIBLE

"CLICK" WHICH HE IS SURE WAS THE SOUND OF A TAPE RECORDER

SHUTTING OFF:

J/1 SAID HE IGNORED THE SOUND, BUT BOTH HIS HOST

AND HOSTESS WERE SHOCKED BY THE NOISE. J/1 SAID THAT

SEEMED TO BE ALL BUSINESS THAT EVENING, ASKING QUESTIONS AND

LEADING THE CONVERSATION.

WHEN J/1 PHONED HIM ON 13 SEP WITH A

PHONE NUMBER HE HAD REQUESTED, L

—SEEMED TENSE. ON 15

SEP, l

]CAME BY TO SEE J/1 AT HIS OFFICE, AGAIN REFERRING

TO HIM AS HIS BROTHER. L

FRIENDLY SELF AND ASKED J/1 WHAT HE WAS DOING OVER THE WEEKEND

AND J/1 SAID HE WAS VERY BUSY.

J/l'S IMPRESSION IS THAT HE WAS

BEING TESTED AND THAT HE PASSED THE TEST. C/OL

I WOULD

CONSULT THE WASHINGTON EXPERTS AND ADVISE J/1 AT NEXT MEETING

WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 1500 ON 24 SEP. WOULD APPRECIATE HOS

COMMENTS PRIOR TO THAT MEETING.

4. DURING THE MEETING,

_TOLD J/1 THAT HE WANTED THE

BIBLE FOR HIMSELF SINCE HE WAS CATHOLIC.

HE SAID THAT

PREVIOUSLY, PARTY MEMBERS COULD NOT BE RELIGIOUS AND REMAIN

PARTY MEMBERS.

HOWEVER, THINGS HAD LIBERALIZED TO THE POINT

WHERE HE COULD NOW HAVE A BIBLE.

10 ASK WHY, IF THINGS WERE MORE LIBERAL NOW,

BEAL NO MIT THAT OUTER

COULD NOT

GET HIS OWN BIBLE FROM CUBA.)

5. J/1 SAID THAT BASED ON HIS ASSESSMENT

WOULD NOT GET FAR WITH HIM USING OFFICIAL AMERICANS.

HE SAID HOWEVER, THAT A SOUTH AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN INTERESTED

IN TRADE IN CUBA (SPECIFICALLY IMPORT/EXPORT) WOULD BE OF

TAS HE HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN LEAVING

THE GOVERNMENT AND INVOLVING HIMSELF IN BUSINESS DEALINGS. J/1

AS BEING INTERESTED IN MONEY (HENCE THE

IN BUSINESS), BUT STILL RETAINING AN INTEREST IN

POLITICS.

C/O TOLD J/1 THAT STATION AND HOS STILL HAD AN

INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF

PERSONALITY AND THAT HE SHOULD

CONTINUE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT. C/O AGAIN TRIED THE PLOY OF

HAVING J/1 WRITE A LETTER TO C/O DESCRIBING

_AS IF C/O

HAD NEVER MET HIM. J/1 SAID HE WOULD TRY TO DO THAT.

STATION ASSESSMENT OF THESE RECENT EVENTS IS TWOFOLD.

IT IS LIKELY THATL

JHAS REPORTED HIS CONTACT WITH C/O'S

DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP.

IT IS POSSIBLE THEN THAT A SECURITY

OFFICIAL INSISTED THAT|

CONFIRM HIS VERSION OF THE

CONTACT WITH

J/1. THE EVENTS OF 9

SEP WOULD SUPPORT THIS THEORY, ESPECIALLY THE OBVIOUS AGENDA

AND THE SHOCK AT THE MIX-UP WITH THE TAPE RECORDER (THIS IS NOT

A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL CONDUCTING A TEST.) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY

IS THAT THIS WAS A TEST FOR J/1, A SORT OF VETTING EXERCISE.

CAME BACK TO J/1 AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,

WOULD APPEAR THAT J/1 PASSED THE TEST.

THE QUESTION REMAINS AS

TO WHO WAS ABLE TO REVIEW THE TAPE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF
