1. The request in Memo No,.43 for support of the Cuban Catholic
Information Bulletin put out by the Committee of Cuban Catholics in
Exile was dinapproved ag have been previous requests for support for
Catholic bulletina (for example, Father Gonzelez Pesada's request for
support for hia seml-monthly Jesult information bulletin on Cuba),
The reasons for dénying aupport to this bulletin ares :

i @, The type of material covered by thio bulletin is slready
covered. in other publications with wider audiences in Latin America,

b, he audience. resched by this bulletin 1s already an
informed audience and is reached by other church organs with good

Cuban information,

ce, This bulletin (published in Spanish and English) does
not reach the masses who must be reached by our propaganda,

@. Support of this type of bulletin is the province of
Catholle groups such as NCWC (which has the NC News Agency and reaches
ehurch papers) and the religious ordera auch 93 the Jesuits,

e, There sre altogether too many "bulletins" at present,
Every group has one and they serve more to publisize that sroup than
to put over effective propaganda to reach the people of Cuba and
Latin America, All such bulletins should be centralized in one
effective information-news type bulletin with up to date truth on
Cuba simply stated ond stressing pictorial content to be spread
throughout Lain America and Cuba without seeking to promote the
interests of any one group, ‘If the CRC continues to publish its
bulletin, this iu the direction it should take,

2. In regard to Memo No, 46, a cable request for approval of
operation Grieta 13 being forwarded,
