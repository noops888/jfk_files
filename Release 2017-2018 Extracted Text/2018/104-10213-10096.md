scheduled for Wednesday, November 2, 1977 at 9:30 a.u. It has

been alleged fros numerous sources that M.. Trafficante was

involved in various activities in conjunction with the Central

Intelligence Agency.

I would appreciate it if you could determine whether or

nor Santos Trafficante, in any manner, had any relationship or

was ever affiliated with the CIA and inform me of this informa

Further, even if Mr. Trafficante had no relationship with

the CIA, he may believe that actions he has taken were at the

direction of responsible persons in the Central Intelligence

Agency.

Accordingly, in order for the Select Committee to

obtain Mr.. Trafficante's truthful testimony, it would be most

•useful for the Co-mittee to have a letter from yourself re

Leasing ir. Trafficante of any obligation of secrecy he may

.. have made to the CIA, to anybody who represented himself as

being affiliated

with the CIA or to anybody it. Trafficante be

lieves was affiliated with the CIA.

It would be very much

appreciated if we could have this letter prior to Mr. Traffi-

cante's scheduled testimony. .

Thank you for your continued cooperation in the Select

Conmittee's investigation.

Sincerely,
