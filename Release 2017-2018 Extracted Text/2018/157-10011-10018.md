to reactivate the operation, to renew the attempt, until
after I had left the Agency, which was in Poerery 1962.
Senator Mondale. Now, you say you discussed probably
with Bundy and Rostow the capability in developing more
i

capability of assassinations. And you may have discussed

it in the context of various potential targets; without
[

deciding on them. Once you decided on a targe or you were

going to recommend a target, what was the process of getting
clearance?

Mr. Bissell. I can't answer you that, simply because

no specific target was ever recommended. And |to the best

of my knowledge and belief, other than the case we have discuss

at length of Castro, which in time preceded the SRRIFLE pro-
ject. The issue of obtaining clearance never arose. I
can speculate on how that would have worked if you wish.
Senator Mondale. No. |
The Chairman. Let's go ahead then with the questions.

Mr. Schwarz. Senator Baker asked, did Helms succeed you?

Mr. Bissell. That is correct.
Mr. Schwarz. Did you turn over SRRIFLE to him and
did you tell him about it? |
Mr. Bissell. I believe I did. And I also believe
that Mr. Harvey told him about it promptly after the turnover.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you know a man called ‘Tustin [e)

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ask him in words or |substance to

kill Mr. Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I asked him to investigate the possibility
and to make explanation for so doing.

Mr. Schwarz. When did you do that?

Mr. Bissell. I don't remember the date of that. I may

have it on a chronology here, but I imagine that is a matter

of record, or that he has testified to that date. I don't
remember the date. !

Mr. Schwarz. Did you tell him this connection with
making plans to go see the passer of the poison, (ie Soteiieh?

Mr. Bissell. I think I probably did. :

Mr. Schwarz. Did he tell you he wouldn't do it?

Mr. Bissell. Later he told me that he didn't want to
do it. But he also said that he thought it was jan inappro-
priate action, and that the desired object could be accom-
plished better in other ways.

Mr. Schwarz. Who authorized you to tell

to take steps: to move toward assassinating Mr. 'Lumumba?
|
Mr. Schwarz. Did you inform the White House of that?

Mr. Bissell. Nobody.

Mr. Bissell. No.

|
Mr. Schwarz. To the best of your knowledge, did anybody
inform the White House of that?

Mr. Bissell. To the best of my knowledge, no.

Mr. Schwarz. Why did you seek to assassinate Mr.
Lumumba?
Mr. Bissell. I didn't seek to assassinate him. I
told a member of the clandestine service to make plans and
develop the capability so to do if it were approved and
ordered.
Senator Goldwater. Approved by who?
Mr. Bissell. It would have then had to have approval
at the highest level of government.
The Chairman. Where did the idea come from?
Mr. Bissell. I don't remember, Mr. Chairman. It could
possibly have been mine.
The Chairman. It could possibly have been) yours?

Senator Baker. How many others did you plan on, just

as a contingency? H
How many other people did you instruct to draw up plans

Mr; Bissell. I don't believe there were any others which |
went to the point of instructing that a man be prepared.
Senator Baker. How many were there that didn't go that

far? How many murders did you contemplate?

Mr. Biseéll. Well, Senator --

quoting a cable concerning the asset WIROGUE, who was sent
to the Congo in the fall of 1960.
The Chairman. Mr. Bissell, the memorandum| to which
counsel has referred reads as follows:

"In recommending the agent or asset ROGUE), (the }

Station, Leopoldville, the Chief of the Agency's African

Division, probably Bronson Tweedy, wrote in late 1960:

‘He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong,
but if he is given an assignment, which may. be morally wrong
in the eyes of the world,but necessary because his case offi-
cer ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he
will dutifully undertake appropriate action for its execution
without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can’ rationalize
all actions'".

Is that fairly representative of the philosophy that
applied to such matters at the time?

Mr. Bissell. Well, it certainly applied within the

range of matters that would have come under SRRIFLE.

Could rE say, Mr. Chairman, that I know of no way in
t

which it is possible to operate a secret intelligence agency

or a secret service unless it has at least a number of

employees who are willing to and can be depended upon to

carry out orders involving acts of this sort.

The Chairman. That assumes, of course, [that the

United States ought to assassinate foreign leaders.

they might eventually be so used.

Mr. Schwarz. Is that a supposition, or is it based upon
any recollection?

Mr. Bissell. I would say it is a faint recollection.
But I find it very difficult in this case to distinguish
between an element of supposition and a dim recollection.

Let me come to what I seem to remember about this matter,
There was, as you have already indicated, several discussions
in the Special Group, and one or more at least in other very
small groups with representation from State, the White House
and the Agency. And I am clear -- I do oe tece EHee the
plans at that time contemplated the arming of obviously a

|

relatively small group inside the Dominican Re uublic, that is,

the provision of arms perhaps for a dozen or soj people, but
not for something like a Bay of Pigs invasion or a major

geurilla activity.

Now, in discussing that kind of an operation, I am
perfectly certain that everyone that participated in the
discussion was clear that weapons so supplied might very well
be used against Trujillo or other senior supporters of his.

Mr. Schwarz. For how many countries in your experience
at the CIA has the US Government supplied arms to dissident

groups within the country?

Mr. Bissell. Well, we have talked about two cases;

common to supply arms to dissident:.elements in countries all
over the world?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, that is correct.

Mr. Schwarz. Does taht also imply that there is an

The Chairman. But you would distinguish this matter from
just supplying of arms to dissidents? In other words, there
was an element of knowledge here that the arms were supplied
for a purpose, and that that purpose might well be the assassi4
nation of Trujillo or other highly placed people in this
Government, correct?

I think is basically consistent with what you said. I would
say that in the planning of this operation, and in the approval}
process, those involved would probably have given a higher
probability to such use being made of the weapons than they
would in some of the other operations that I have referred to.

Mr. Schwarz. However, just focusing on the Special
Group as of the 12th of January, you can't tell from the
minutes which state of mind existed, but you have a faint
recollection that the more targeted state of mind existed as off
the 12th of January?

Mr. Bissell. My impression is that as of that time, as
I mentioned at the end of the testimony this morning, the
reason that the State Department, and probably ne Agency's

1
representatives in the Special Group, favored this group was

ry

a pragmatic reason. It was to maintain and strengthen politica
ties with the dissidents:
Mr. Schwarz. The next matter of record that we should

focus on igs a memorandum of January 25, 1961, apparently

reflecting a discussion of Mfmonece*eMDERD . Was fEMDEED the
code for the overthrow of Trujillo?

Mr. Bissell. I suspect it was the code name for the
project of support to the dissidents.

and this record, which is a record we have obtained from
the Agency, may be unfair to you. But do you fee agree
that on this record it appears that on the item of the pass-
ing of the weapons which were the weapons that aece in fact
used, it appears that the AGency elected to keep the State

I believe that °~ what ‘eventually passed to the dissidents

of these cables in fact refers to the passage to the dissi-

dents:

This cable states the conditional willingness at some

time in the future to pass machine guns. That permission
was never granted and they were never passed.

It refers to pouching revolvers. And I don't
know whether there was a record that those were ever passed,

or even intended to be passed, to the dissidents. And it would
