TECHNICAL DATA FOR A PROPOSED INSTALLATION OF MISUR
COVERAGE AT 902 SOUTH EIGHTH STREET, PHILADELPHIA, PA.

The telephone cable information, previously supplied, and
technical data telephonically furnished have been reviewed. Two
instailation techniques are submitted for your consideration.

1, BIRD. Thie anit employs the game principle as the BAT
described on-page 27, Part i, of the Handbook of Technical Equipment.
The miciophone unit is small enough to be concealed within the network of
a Western Electric 500+type telephone. instrument. . It is connected across
the telephone line at-all times, .drawing three milliamperes from the "quiet"
‘telephone battery source your telephone company contact agreed to supply
to the target line. This unit is not operative when the telephone is in use,
therefore the current drain should not affect normal telephone operation.
However, before: installing. this device, you should check with your sources
in the company to determine if this three milliampere drain will operate
central office ‘line equipment, particularly.to determine whether it will be
reported by the automatic line~checking (testing) equipment.

As with the BAT, the intelligence picked up by the mierophone
cannot be heard by use of a linesman's test set or with ordinary headphones.
Relatively complex equipment. is required to recover the intelligence.

The recovery equipment is.in.a cylinder measuring 1" in diameter
and 15"long. This equipment: should bemaounted on the pole or along the cable
in the rear of 906 South 8th Street. The target telephone line should loop
through the recovery unit by connecting a-pair of wires from this unit to
Binding Post 8 and another pair of wires from this unit to the drop line
serving the target instrument. A third pair of wires from the recovery

: unit. should be connected to the leased line back to the central monitoring

: point. The mi¢rophone-coverage (signal) is audible between the recovery
unit, and the monitoring plant and can be read with a pair of headphones or
a.linesman's test set.

. A Regulated Power Supply will be connected to the leased line
in the monitoring plant to furnish operating current for the recovery unit
‘and to reamplify the MISUR signal. The transmission range for the output
‘of the recovery unit should be no more than five wire miles. If the trans-
mission range exceeds this limit, it may be necessary to install the
preamplifier at a multiple point, such as at the corner of South 8th Street
and Washington Avenue, - If the’multiple point is used, provision must be made
for the installation of a Regulated Power Supply in a secure place accessible
for changing batteries or one with 110-volts alternating current for an AC
power supply. A second léased line will be used for transmitting the output
from the Regulated Power Supply back to the monitoring plant.

- Ini summary, if the mukiple appearance is used for this
installation, one pair of wires must be reserved or leased to provide a
transmission path from the recovery unit to the multiple appearance and a
Second leased pair is used for transmission of the preamplified signal output
of the Regulated Power Supply to the field office monitoring plant.

2. YWener Activated Microphone (ZAM). This technique employs
the same installation principle as the Single-Pair Microphone-Télephone
(SPMT) technique described on page 181, Part 1 of the Handbook of Technical
Equipment. A ZAM unit may be installed in the network of a Western Electric
§00<type telephone set instead of the altered condenser can described in the
manual.

If this technique is employed, a secure area, either in close
proximity to the terminal box in the rear of 906 South 8th or at the multiple
appearance at Washington Avenue and South 8th Street, where the target
telephone line can be looped through a concealed automati¢ SPMT ‘unit.

The automatic SPMT unit is contained in four cases as follows:

A. An SPMT switching unit measuring 7 5/8" wide, 8 1/4" high
and 10" deep. This unit automatically transfers the target line from "Telephone" |
to "Microphone" immediately when the hand piece is removed from the cradle.
Approximately 7. 5 seconds after the hand piece is restored to the cradle
(hung up) this unit will automatically switch to the “Microphone" mode for
MISUR coverage. Because this unit is position sensitive it should be operated
in-the vertical position at all times.

B. A battery supply measuring 6" wide, 4 3/8" high and 5" deep
contains the batteriés to operate the microphone, current regulating

devices to prevent excessive current damaging the microphone and a meter
to measure microphone current. It is recommended that the batteries in
this unit be replaced with fresh batteries no less than once each a week.

“The SPMT unit must be in the "OFF" mode while the batteries are being

¢ehanged.

¢.. Remote control tone switching unit.. This unit, in a case
measuring 7" wide, 5 3/4" high and 15" deep, is used to turn the SPMT unit
on and off. Included in this unit is a transistorized audio amplifier to bring
the MISUR signal up to the normal telephone line transmission level.

D. Notch filter, This unit measures 3 3/4" wide, 5 3/4" high
and 5 1/4" deep. This is used to prevent certain voice frequencies from
activating the tone equipment described in C.

The equipment, described in A-D, above, must be placed ina
secure room or space where the target line may be looped through the SPMT
unit, A 110-volt source at 3 amperes must be available for the equipment.
The equipment should be placed in a dust-free enclosure accessible for
servicing.

‘The steps for installing this technique are as follows:

a. Substitute an altered telephone for the instrument now in the
target area.

b. Have a spare cable pair available for service from the remote
plant to the terminal box in the rear of 906 South 8th Street. If a secure area
is selected in close proximity to 906 South 8th Street, it will not be necessary
to provide a cable pair for service between the SPIMT unit and the target line
as the target line may be looped through the SPMT unit via a four~-conductor
drop line,

€, Set-up the remote plant, as set forth above, looping the target
line from Binding Post 7 at 8th Street and Washington Avenue, through the
SPMT equipment to the spare cable pair terminating in the rear of 906 South
8th Street,

d. Connect the cable pair running to the monitoring plant to the
output of the automatic SPMT unit.

é. Test the continuity of the target telephone service and, if
satisfactory, transfer the drop wire serving the target instrument. from
Binding Post 8 to the pair described in b.

Complete wiring diagrams and detailed installation procedures
will accompany the equipment.

‘The ability to install either of the above-described techniques is
contingent upon the substitution of an altered instrument in the target area
and making certain changes at the terminal box at the rear of 906 South 8th
Street. The BIRD will require a full-time "quiet" battery supply from the
telephone and the installation of ‘a recovery unit at the working appearance for
the target instrument. The ZAM will require no change in the telephone
battery source but will need a small secure area in which the automatic
SPMT equipment may be concéaled. it is not necessary that this SPMT
equipment be in the immediate area of the target instrument. The only
change required at the working appearance for the target instrument is to
shift the drop wire from the assigned Binding Post to a new Binding Post
described in 2b.

Another factor to consider in this case is the matter of readable
signal, The MISUR signal between the BIRD and the recovery unit is not
readable with headphones or a linesman's test set whereas the signal level
of the ZAM is readable with headphones or a linesman's test set.
