ReBulet 2/11/64 and telephone call from Supervisor Dave Breen

and sa John l. Pearce, of your office, in captioned matter.

The telephone

cable information, previously supplied, and technical data telephonically

furnished have been reviewed in the Laboratory.

The Laboratory's technical

observations are attached for study by the sound-trained personnel of your

oftice.

You should, after a review of the attached by your sound-trained

Agents, advise the Bureau the technique you propose to install in the target

The telephone instrument you desire altered should be sent to the

Laboratory for installation of the disguised MISUR equipment.

In scheduling

the installation date, a minimum of three weeks, after receipt of the equip-

ment in the Laboratory should be allowed for the packaging of the line

equipment and altering the instrument.

It, in your opinion, you feel on-the-spot technical assistance of

the Laboratory is needed, you should so indicate in your reply.

This technical data is for use by your office in evaluating the

installation possibilities in this case and does not constitute authority to

make the installation. Authority to install must be obtained separately.

TECHNICAL DATA FOR A PROPOSED INSTALLATION OF MISUR

COVERAGE AT 902 SOUTE EIGHTE STREET, PHILADELPHIA, PA.

The telephone cable information, previously supplied, and

technical data telephonically furnished have been reviewed.

Two

installation techniques are submitted for your consideration.

1.

BIRD. This unit employs the same principle as the BAT

le rite pipe i am on the ta come edict the peters of

a Western Electric 500-type telephone instrument. It is connected across

the telephone line at all times, drawing three milliamperes from the "quiet"

telephone battery source your telephone company contact agreed to supply

to the target line. This unit is not operative when the telephone is in use,

therefore the current drain should not affect normal telephone operation.

However, before installing this device, you should check with your souces

in the company to determine if this three milliampere drain will operate

central office line equipment, particularly to determine whether it will be

reported by the automatic line-checking (testing) equipment.

As with the BAT, the intelligence picked up by the microphone

cannot be heard by use of a linesman's test set or with ordinary headphones.

Relatively complex equipment is required to recover the intelligence.

The recovery equipment is in a cylinder measuring 1" in diameter

and 15" long.

This equipment should bemounted on the pole or along the cable

in the rear of 906 South 8th Street. The target telephone line should loop

through the recovery unit by connecting a pair of wires from this unit to

Binding Post 8 and another pair of wires from this unit to the drop line

serving the target instrument. A third pair of wires from the recovery

unit should be connected to the leased line back to the central monitoring

point. The microphone coverage (signal) is audible between the recovery

unit and the monitoring plant and can be read with a pair of headphones or

a linesman's test set.

A Regulated Power Supply will be connected to the leased line

in the monitoring plant to furnish operating current for the recovery unit

and to reamplify the MISUR signal.

The transmission range for the output

of the recovery unit should be no more than five wire miles. If the trans

mission range exceeds this limit, it may be necessary to install the

preamplifier at a multiple point, such as at the corner oi south oth street

and Washington Avenue. I the multiple point is used, provision must be made

or Changin batteries rene with poet al ra te cue place an ible

power supply. A second leased line will be used for transmitting the output

from the Regulated Power Supply back to the monitoring plant.

In summary, if the mutiple appearance is used for this

installation, one pair of wires must be reserved or leased to provide a

transmission path from the recovery unit to the multiple appearance and a

second leased pair is used for transmission of the preamplified signal output

of the Regulated Power Supply to the field office monitoring plant.

2. Zener Activated Microphone (ZAM). This technique employs

the same installation principle as the Single-Pair Mierophone-Telephone

(SPMT) technique described on page 181, Part I of the Handbook of Technical

Equipment. A ZAM unit may be installed in the network of a Western Electric

500-type telephone set instead of the altered condenser can described in the

manual.

If this technique is employed, a secure area, either in close

proximity to the terminal box in the rear of 906 South 8th or at the multiple

appearance at Washington Avenue and South 8th Street, where the target

telephone line can be looped through a concealed automatic SPMT unit.

The automatic SPMT unit is contained in four cases as follows:

A. An SPNT switching unit measuring 7 5/8'' wide, 8 1/4" high

and 10" deep. This unit automatically transfers the target line from "Telephone"

to "Vicrophone" immediately when the hand piece is removed from the cradle.

Approximately 7. 5 seconds after the hand piece is restored to the cradle

(hung up) this unit will automatically switch to the "Microphone" mode for

MISUR coverage. Because this unit is position sensitive it should be operated

in the vertical position at all times.

B. A battery supply measuring f" wide, 4 3/8" high and 5" deep

contains the batteries to operate the microphone, current regulating

devices to prevent excessive current damaging the microphone and a meter

to measure microphone current. It is recommended that the batteries in

this unit be replaced with fresh batteries no less than once each a week.

The SPMT unit must be in the "OFF" mode while the batteries are being

changed.

C.

Remote control tone switching unit. This unit, in a case

measuring 7" wide, 5 3/4" high and 15" deep, is used to turn the SPMT unit

the MISUR signal up to the normal telephone line transmission level.

D. Notch filter.

This unit measures 3 3/4'' wide, 5 3/4" high

and 5 1/4" deep. This is used to prevent certain voice frequencies from

activating the tone equipment described in C.

The equipment, described in A-D, above, must be placed in a

secure room or space where the target line may be looped through the SPMT

unit.

A 110-volt source at 3 amperes must be available for the equipment.

The equipment should be placed in a dust-free enclosure accessible for

servicing.

The steps for installing this technique are as follows:

Substitute an altered telephone for the instrument now in the

a.

target area.

b. Have a spare cable pair available for service from the remote

plant to the terminal box in the rear of 906 South 8th Street. It a secure area

is selected in close proximity to 906 South 8th Street, it will not be necessary

to provide a cable pair for service between the SPMT unit and the target line

as the target line may be looped through the SPMT unit via a four-conductor

drop line.

c. Set up the remote plant, as set forth above, looping the target

line from Binding Post 7 at 8th Street and Washington Avenue, through the

SPMY equipment to the spare cable pair terminating in the rear of 906 South

8th Street.

d. Connect the cable pair running to the monitoring plant to the

output of the automatic SPMT unit.

Test the continuity of the target telephone service and, if

satisfactory, transfer the drop wire serving the target instrument from

Binding Post 8 to the pair described in b.

Complete wiring diagrams and detailed installation procedures

will accompany the equipment.

The ability to install either of the above-described techniques is

contingent upon the substitution of an altered instrument in the target area

and making certain changes at the terminal box at the rear of 906 South 8th

Street. The BIRD will require a full-time "quiet" battery supply from the

telephone and the installation of a recovery unit at the working appearance for

the target instrument.

The ZAM will require no change in the telephone

battery source but will need a small secure area in which the automatic

SPIT equipment may be concealed. It is not necessary that this SPMT

equipment be in the immediate area of the target instrument. The only

change required at the working appearance for the target instrument is to

shift the drop wire from the assigned Binding Post to a new Binding Post

described in 2b.

Another factor to consider in this case is the matter of readable

signal.

The MISUR signal between the BIRD and the recovery unit is not

readable with headphones or a linesman's test set whereas the signal level

of the ZAM is readable with headphones or a linesman's test set.
