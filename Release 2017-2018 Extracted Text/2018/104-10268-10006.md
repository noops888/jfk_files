))

Metiorandum of Conversation, Dan
Setather/Les Midgley and the DCI,
Dated 6 September 1975

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and that<fave crept up every so often
since then. In one form or i x, the allegations are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD hadPeew connected with the Agency.

The allegations are oe “uytfounded. .
<
2. The facts re, € tter are as follows: :

7 SY es
a. On 2 mba 39$3 I was instructed by

Mr. R.G.Roc fe superior at that time, to
make a tho! auecprthin the Agency at Headquarters
to determi: @ Harvey OSWALD had ever been
used by the ‘agend o& been connected with it in any
conceivable way. ordered me to make the checks
directly and personally to the degree possible and not
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R. \
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one ,of the i
Agency's key contact officials with the Warren i
Commission. |

b.° Although I had already checked the Main Index
of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I
rechecked the Main Index and found no’ record beyond
that which I had already obtained.before (plus, those
items which had been integrated {nto the-records system i
since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO
records which indicated any Agency connection with
OSWALD. |

negative results.

results were negative.

4, I recall very clearly that we were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American‘returning

from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by
pcb, thus having established contact with the Agency.

The same point has now, quite understandably, been made
by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge’of this
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid
reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite
uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in
those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade ‘e were sO many persons travelling to
and from the Sot Inion that DCD was incapable of talk-
ing to all of fhem? Therefore, a program of selectivity

and specific-taxye axyet applicability was instituted. In

light of tk@\a & seems to me that OSWALD-- if he
came to DEA Sat nts at all--would have easily been
by-pass. “beca SN simply did not possess the type of
nfo: Sted was seeking at that time. DCD would
sure, ts limited manpower on travellers who
ha ater access in the USSR.

Shou be added that my above-described
search in She Agency file holding produced no record or
indication that any other US Government agency had used
him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J. EDGAR HOOVER
26 November 1963 - 11:20 a.m. ono

Da: I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. 1 know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

Hi We have had the very best support that we could possibly }
expect from you.

DCL: Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

Bi We will feel free to do that

DCI: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to |
make it.

H: We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that firedthe gun. But there is no question
that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i: Mexico City.
We have now found that the. photograph that was ta cen was not

that of Oswald. We do find from our informant dovm there that i
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has - :
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit !
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wold take three

weeks, He had, I think, ‘a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

DC: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there. We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.
Biber shock

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of the.Government agencies that are mentioned
in it, State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc. i
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the .
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be 1
sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it
is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will
have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said i
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements
might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they
will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-
spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates
that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous
interviews. I raiged with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent
information which yOu are processing which originated with the
sensitive WHSouree. I informed him that in your view. this would

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the GI covers the ex-

a cover adapted to his situation, and the DGI takes care of all the expenses

On 17 December Mr. Papich GR
anticipating a request from the \Qmiission, named by President

Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials
supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-
vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with the/Sylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States
Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich
inguirea as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some
other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter vas discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and othera

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of *
the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive information vhich could relate to

telephone taps.
Mr. Papich again raised the question on 19

mber and after

Mr, Papich that when the Bureau is facg4\ WO problems of this
nature in meeting the needs of the a the Bureau should
not pass to the Commission infoj Sy Agency, but should
refer the Commission to the Ag onal information.
Tt was mentioned to Mr. Peg ‘to meet the needs

from it or simply as revenge. The Ambassador added that not
even the allezations of Alvarado or other rumors which may have
been current in next Pe BY hat money had been
given to Oswald were y lal Y hen s suspicions, since
the Alvarado allegationfp} pee @ay or so later,
but that the fact that Oswald had visited the Cuban and Russicn
- Embassies in Mexico City shortly before, the assassination, which
he had learned from his security officers at the Embassy, plus
_ what he believed about Castro's character, seemed sufficient to
“him to raise the gravest suspicions. Later, he pointed out,
when he had 4 chance to listen to the Dorticos-Armas intercepts,
his suspicions were strengthened.

Ambassador Nann knew of no contacts by Oswald with

anyone in Mexico City other than his visits to the Cuban and

Soviet Embassics and his staying at the Hotel del Comercio.

such an examination had not yet been made and that he

bound for Cuba. Likewise, the Mexiczn Immigration officials

will not permit anyone, whether Mexican or American, to depart

for Cuba unless he has the proper Cuban travel permits. No
special Mexican travel permit is required for Americans at
least, but the Mexican officials indirectly enforce Cuban law
by insisting upon complete Cuban documentation. (It should be

“could make them without actually quoting the entire trans-

information on Oswald, since he has stated that he has no

recollection of Oswald ever having stayed at the hotel?

1. One of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate other

than his first was in the afternoon. See paragraph 11 of the
first police interrogation.

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

“Consulate at least twice and probably three times.

This seems so because:
a. There 1s no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday.

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban
Consulate at least once on Friday and at least once on

Saturday, see CIA memorandum, pages 6 through 8.

e. Oswald's argument with Azque was in the after-

the argument with Azque took place was itself different from

Silvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get
a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip
of paper with her name and telephone number; because Azque
telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,
see paragraph 4 of this memorandum, and Oswald was given
Duran's slip of paper subsequent: to this phone call, when he

“Posing Certain Questions’ on their Letter to Us
dated 31 January 1964

I would include in our letter to ene CIA the following
. questions:

1. Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

. * | Supposed to have taken place in an sufomobile outside the
Te + °° Ouban Enbassy in Mexico City? -"---

2. Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet
Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? If you
@o, can we find out its contents?

- 3. Reference 1s made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your
letter. Would it be possible for us to see the full report
- of the Mext. police inter ms. of Mrs. Duran and her
husbarid?... = i 4 poate So roe D . .

4, Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald,

. "that same afternoon,” came back “again” to the Cuban
Embassy. Does this mean that he was there twice the same
day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous
day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the
Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this
sentence seems consistent with the CiA-confirmed information
found in the subsequent paragraphs . In general, we would
appreciate as much cla on as you can give us on the i
time sequence of the) P Be aragraph 7. Of t
course, if you are the full text of

She intended?

6. Reference is made to BITED sentence in the 2nd
subparagraph of paragraph 12b. Is there any significance
7 to the word, "Although"? We wonder whether the 4nformant
is, + meant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran
we reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued
” to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

7. Refermce is again made to the 2nd subparagraph of
: aragraph 12b. Your letter states that Mrs. Duran told the
Soviet Embassy” that Oswald"knew no one in Cuba} and that
the Soviet official “echoed her statement that the American
. _ was not known." It 1s unclear to us whether this discussion
* . Anvolved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet
officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not Inowing
anyone in the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies.

8. Reference 1s made to paragraph 12c. Was the "direct
conversation" between one of the members of the Soviet
Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was
at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that
Mrs. Duran sent Oswald personally over to the Soviet Ded
wee + ta-contaet.’one of tha officials there? . --.. .

9. Reference is again made to paragraph 12c. Could
you olarify the many references to the "address" referred to
80 frequently in this paragraph?

10. ‘Throughout your entire letter the term "Soviet
Consulate” sees, to be used interchangeably with the tern
"Soviet Enbassy,* Likewise with "Cuban Consulate” and
“Cuban Embassy." We assume from this that the Soviet
Consulate and the’ Soviet ee wast be the same in Mexico

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence
SUBJECT: Quwin

1. Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make
the following recommendations concerning the further handling
and possible disposition of QUWIN:

a. I believe the original purpose for which
QUWIN was continued and sent to his present under-
cover assignmen’ Karwan i

to justify the q Be lautelles
termination of his presen: SonerAee” 6r this purpose

we Qawin, ROLE 1... ueeeie

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles
in Europe where we have very few assets. Whether this
is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends
on the determination of how he can be used either by *
the German beeen pe oo he Austrian Station or by
any other KUBARK as a long term unofficial
cover agent. He is not being used at the present time.
He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any
operational assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of
Station Luxembourg and RABNEY be consulted by
Headquarters for their best recommendations as to
the continued use of QJWIN. After these recommendations
are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian
stations be consulted for their possible interest in
using him. If after these discussions a sensible
framework for the operational use of QUWIN can be
established, I would recommend we continue him. If
not, I would recommend that he be terminated at the
time his present contract expires.

2. As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation
which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for
security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sometime in Summer 1960 --

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family ease
were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival. .

2, I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck >
me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I
told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get
the information we need, because this individual looks odd." } We were
particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on thg' Minsk
‘factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city
itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop
target personality dossiers. ‘

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered
in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet |
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually ~
divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning “home”,
The AEOCEAN 3 case was.among the first of these, and we eventually turned
up something like two dozen similar cases, We established links between
some of these women and the KGB. KUDESK became interested, in the developing
trend we had come across, It was partly out of curiosity to learn if
Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of
interest in Oswald's own exp d in the U SSR, that we showed operational
intelligence interest in the/flarvep story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Repart conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that °
effort.

The lists fall into the foliowing sections:

E.1 Dissemination to the Intelligence Community .
E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission
£.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,
all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by
cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file. Ad-
ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.
Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff
received copies of all CSCI's.
