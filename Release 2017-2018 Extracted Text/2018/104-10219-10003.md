DCS Case 53199

On 4 September 1969, Chief, LAPO, met with Hugh C. McDonald,

President

of World Associate Inc. A former law enforcement officer (Chief of Detectives,

L08 Angeles County Sheriffs' Office, retired) he has an excellent reputation

among law enforcesent ageneles.. Ho

has cooperated with the Agency fully in

the past.

He de a cleared source of LAFO/DCS.

Since hia retirement McDonald has started Horld Associates Ine., a

company with two divisions, the Security Diviaion and the Alrcraft Division.

3. The Security Division provides, de its primary service, a bank

security system, desigred to provide banklag institutions wich a means to

control and curtall looses from fraud and robbery.

4• The Aireraft Division vas set up because of the exclusive contract

) World Associates has wich the Hughes Tool Company (Hugnes Alreraft) for the

¿sale of helicopters co lau enforcement agearles, to operate a helicopter pilor

#training achool for municipal and other lew enforcement agencies and to handle

the installation of helicopter patrol syasems.

This contract applies to all

countries escept the lS. McDonald said he expecte to sell the Hughee Model

300 hellcopter to foreign law enforcement agencies. None of these has been

sold abroad, with the exception of the Philippines.

He will have to open up

offices in order to demonstrate, sell and arrange for servicing of the

helicoptere.

A helicopter pilot-salesman and a technical representative would

be noeded at a beginning cost of about $13,000 per year. McDonald said he

would have a good, plausible reason for sercing up

such an office in Hong Kong,

not only: to sell and service police helicopters in the Crown Colony, but alse

to use de a base for other Asian country activities. McDonald expecte to

ratart exploring the foreign police potential for helicopters in the near

future, beginning with a trip to South America.

The possibillty of using foreiga offices to promote che activities of

the Security Diviaion of the company also exiets.

6. Currently, MeDonald 1e in Hawall and is exploring the possibility of

setting up a police intelligence school in Havail to train police officers

from Asian countries.

Attached are copies of data pertaining to prospectus, products.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECTI MGotiaß With DiT. Hugh C. MicDonald, Preaidant of

World Aesociates Ince

A/S

7149Ü59

lo In rosponse lo a request from Air. Killgore, on the stall of

SERsBOr Barry Colduater (No, Arizo), 1 met with Dir. Hugh C. MeDonald

al the Madisoa Hotol this afternoon, MeDonald explalaed that he le in

the banking and security business, baving previouely worked in the

Los Angelos County Shortl'a Office. He also said he had a contractual

relationchip eilà the Agency some years ago and served as chief of

cocurity for Senator Goldwater during his campsige for the presidency

ln 1953.

2. Ar. McDonald ladied this morning with Senator Goldwater

about bie interest in mooting with aomeone from the Agency to discusa

a report which he has prepared on the subject of highly senaltive Sovlet

bacteriologiest mirfare activities on the island of Vosrobdenlya in the

Aral Ses. McDonald sald be originally bocame avare of the existence

of the nocret Sovlet activity in thia locality while in Europe on a businese

trip. Ho docided to follow le up and was referred from one contact lo

another until he was virtually at the Russian border and decidod he had

Inventigatad the matter as far as he fall ho could vitiour the possibility

of personal ries, MeDonald poiated out that the information in tie report

was obtained from sourcos uho apoke freely lo him without any remunera-

don whateoever.

He added that he understood from some of bia sources

that thay had been in louch with the Agency or with U.S. Intelligence

reprosentatives and had become reluctant to deal further with theoe

representatives because they were not treated properly by them and

the sourcos feared the Agency had been penetrated by Soviet a gento.

The reasons for McDonald'e contact with us are threefolds

a. After preparing the 65-page raport. (a copy of stich

be gavo me) he became concerned that publication of thie

document mighi not be in the rational interest. He la andou

for our advice on this.

b. He is intereated in knowing whother the information

do rosoonably accurate. He quito naturally does not want to

publish a story that contains errors.

C. He is interested in knowing whather the Agency wante

bo dolve fusther into this mattor.

4o With regard to the possible publication el the raport, McDonald

aaid he planned to talk in very general torms this aftemoon with repre

pentatives of Time/Lifo. He will make no commitments to them and

will treat ble meeting an strictly exploratory, It is McDonald'e opinion

that the story would appeal to publishers and would bring approsimately

$200, 000 to $300,000.

Mr. NcDonald claims he has no real interest in pursulag thie

subjoet further unlass the Agency feola thore la real merit in it. He

cald hão cources are "vide Open" and he le confident that further informa-

Men could be developed although he bas no direct contact with them ao

Isdividuale and woald probably havo to go through the same laborioue

procese of contacting one person through another as he did before.

Bo McDonald plane to leave Washington tomorrow, but eald be

could atay.in town through Friday if this was neccaonry. He said ho

camo hore for the express purpose of discuening the report with us.

He said ho did not consider Senator Goldwater a personal friend, but

Indicated he had traveled thousando of miles with the Senator during

Mo presidential campagn and although ho argued with him on many

subjects had a very high regard for him. It was agreed that I would

get the report in the hande of the appropriate Agency people as coon as

possible and attemptto give him a preliminary reaction some time

around; that I had perconally hoard the Director comment years aso

that he would nor permit any pressure on anyone, anytine, anywhere.

Heronald replied,

"Thon he has changed. I know that people have been
