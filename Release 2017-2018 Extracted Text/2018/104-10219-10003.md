not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System, Finally, he does not
Plan 8 “world tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting
bankers aad government security people in various Latin American countries.
He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries.
Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries.
Hig.purpose in making these trips is to sell. Hughes helicopters to foreign
police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD era

SUBJECT: Meeting with d:: Hugh C. ‘McDonald, President of

World Associates Inc. <1)
oo 7
py

1. In response to a request from Mr. Killgore, on the staff of
Senator Barry Goldwater (K., Ariz.), I met with Mr, Hugh C. McDonald
at the Madison Hotel this afternoon, MeDonald explained that he is in
the banking and eecurity business, having previously worked in the
Les Angelos County Sheriff's Office. He also said he had a contractual
relationchip with the Ageacy some years ago and served as chief of
security for Senator Goldwater during bis campsign for the presidency
in 1963.

i 2. Mr. bicDonald taixed this morning with Senator Coldwater
about his taterest in-moeting with zomesne from the Agency to. discuso

-bactoriologics! warfare activitice on the island of Vogrozkdeniya in the
Aval Sea. . MeDonald eaid be originally became aware of the existence
of tho secret Soviet activity in thio locality while in Europe-on a business
trip. Ho decided to follow {t up and wae referred from one contact to
another until he wao virtually at the Ruasian border and decidod hs had
dnvestigated the matter ag far as ho falt be could without the possibility

of personal risk. Mcionald pointed ont that the infarmation in his report
was obtained from sources who apoke freely to him without any romunera-
on whatsoever. He added that he understood from same_of his sources
that thay had been in touch with the Agency or with U.S. intelligence
feprosentatives and had become reluctant to deal further with these
representatives because they were not treated properly by them and

the sources feared the Agency had been penetrated by Soviet agents.

3. The reasons for McDonald's contact with us are threefold;

a. After preparing the 6S-page report. (a copy of which
be gavo me) he became concerned that publication of this
document reight not be in the rational interest, He is anxious
for our advice on this, .

b. He ie interested in knowing whether the information
f fe reasonably accurate. He quite naturally does not want to
F publish a story that containg errors,

€ He ia interested in ‘mowing whethsr the Agency wants
te delve further into this matter.

_ 4. With regard to the possible publication ef the report, McDonslé
asid he planned to talk in very general torms this afternoon with repre.
sentatives of Time/Life. He will make no commitments to'them and
will troat his meeting a. strictly exploratory, it is MeBonald's opinion

that the story would 2ppeal to publishers and would being approximately
$200, 000 to $300, 000, i .

5. Mr, MeDenald claims he has no real interost in

., Subject further uniass tho Agency feels there.is

ohington tomorrow, but eaid he
6 WAS necesonry, He said ho

joldwater a personal friend, but

No prooidential campaign and although ho argued with him on many
subjects bad s very Mgh regard for him, It was Agreed that I would
get tha report fa the hands of the appropriate Agency people as.seon ag

possible and attemptto give him a preliminary reaction some time
tomorrow. .



7. Tke report haa been forwarded to Dr. Karl Weber, of Ost,
for review. A check with the Domestic Contact Service Heclosed that
MeDonald had been a contact of the California Field Office an
considered by DCS to be somewhat of a phony and a nuisance, his
clearances wore verified by them. MeDonald deeo net appear to me
to be 5 crackpot although I have not read his report, He gave no indication
at this meetizg of making a "pitch"! He appesred concerned about the
informatics be hae uncovered and seems to cant to do what io right undor
the circumstences. Me. Killgore, in Senator Goliwater’s office, has
eoked that we give him a followup report on cur contact with McDonald,
