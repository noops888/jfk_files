MLMORAWDUM TO FiLis
From: James ». Weidner

Subject: Interview with Raymond G. Rocca,
February 14, 1975, 2 p.m.

A, BACKGROUND

Rocca is originally from San Francisco, and
he still maintains a home there. ine was graduated from
the University of California in 1938 with an Ab and in
1939 with an MA in international relations. His thesis
related to tne facist problem in the Meditarranean area.

In April, 1942, he joined the Researcn and
vevelopment Section of the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence
Service. With the collapse of Italy in September, 1943,
Rocca joined. the UsS K2 group (which was independent
although coordinate with the counterintelligence OSS unit).

Until carly July, 1944, when ne went to Rome,
Angleton assumed command of the X2 unit in 1944, Rocca
eventually became Anyleton's executive aide there.

Angleton left Rome in wovember, 1947. Rocca
remained, under student cover. lie was not under “official
cover."

Rocca returned to the United States and

stayed a year in CIA headquarters. ne attended the
wational War Colleye in 1954-55. Rocca then joined
Angleton in the recently created Counterintelligence (CI)
Staff of tne CIA. (ithe Staff was set up in vecember,
1954 or early 1955. Prior to that time, the counter-
intelligence operation nad been submerged in foreign
intelligence. At this point, it was broken out to be

an independent unit.) Rocca was assigned to be the chief
of the Research anu Analysis (2 and A) component of the
CI Staff. ie remained in that capacity until 1969 when
he became Angleton's ueputy. ue resigned/retired from
the CIA on vecember 31, 1974.

b&b. OBJE

IVES OF COUNTLRIN co LGuuCk

‘vyne overall opjective of the Staff was to
form a uoctrinal vasis for CI. because CI nad not been
a separate unit theretofore, it was necessary to specify
precisely what its purpose and operational objectives
would be. ‘these ovjectives were: (1) penetration of
other agencies; taat is, identification of other agents
and achievement of placing otaer ayents therein; (2)
developing uouble ayents; (3) handling uefectors,
principally those coming out of other services; (4)
development of types of controls; that is, intercepting
and deciphering of communications (Tne mail intercept
program would have fallen within this objective.); and
(5) accomplisument of research. ‘nis involved building
files, analyzing relevant information, and creating
uescriptive papers.

Lxamples of this support were the arrest of
Sobel in the 1950's (R and A mace a ian available to work
on this case.) anu the Reino uaynanen defection leading
to the conviction of Abel.

b. training

R and A uoes part of tie counterintelliyence

Rocca gave me a detailed outline of the
organization of the CI Division. A schematic of tuat
organization is annexed hereto. ‘rhe organization retained
its structure until August, 1973, when its operations were
reduced substantiaily. (According to Rocca, approximately
100 of the CI personnel were shifteu to other areas.)

“&. Mailing Intercept Program

Rocca knew notiiing of the program at all until
1960 when R anu A conmenced receiving through COMIn?
channels moderate anounts (no more tnan one or two pieces
a month) of descriptions or Photograpas. He could not
recall the particulars of any of these matters. He
assumed that tne entire project had been directed and
properly approved. ‘the project was handled, insofar as
¢I was involved, by the Special Investigations group.
It was highly compartmented. When Rocca became Angleton's
deputy in 1969, he learneu more concerning the existence
of the project. ie understood tnat it was a special
project prouucing niyh-yrade information on the main
adversary. Rocca saiu that ie would classify the project
as a "strategic significance" because it yielded information
on individuals communicating witn people working for the
KGB, le could not recall specific details, Particularly
important, in his opinion, was the fact that the adversary
did not know tnat the project existed.

Rocca was not responsible on a day-to-day
basis for the project even after he became ueputy. ‘that
responsibility was given to Fred uubbard, Angleton's
sxecutive virector, whom I believe had been appointed at
approximately tne same time as Rocca. Monthly reports
from the project would come to Rocca at which time he
reviewed them briefly and passed tacm on to Angleton.

Rocca says tnat he iad no particular discussions concerning
the project with ecitner Angleton or bubbard which he can
recall.

In 1971 or 1972, however, Rocca nau to
“defend" the project to aaranessines. ‘nis was a part
of what constituted, in essence, an annual review by the
veputy Director of all significant projects in which CI
was involved. ‘the task fell to Rocca because Angleton
was then on vacation. liubbard and others involved
directly in the project prepared a pro forma justification
for Rocca to present to Karamessines. ‘This was based on
the production of the project, as well as tne high
security surrounding it.

In July, 1973, after tubbard had left, Rocca
and the JCI had determined to abanuon the mail intercept
project. Rocca was assigned to winu down the operation.
At that point, there were three or four CI people in
heauquarters involved in the project.* ‘the project was
located in the COMI area on the seventh floor. Because
COMINT needed the space, Rocca developed a new vault for
it on_the second floor with tiie remainder of el,
urs. | _ was reassigned to Uperations, and the two
translators were assigned to R and &. Tne product of
the project still remains in tne vault area on the
second floor,

Rocca hau no knowledge of the specifics of the
operation in New York. ‘this was because that aspect of
the project was handled by the Office of Security. In
essence, the Special Investigations group of CI was a
“customer" of the Office of Security. In addition, CI
analyzed the materials and distributed them to the
appropriate recipients. Angleton determined who would
receive the materials.

Rocca knew nothing of the Wew Orleans
operation and almost nothing about tne San Francisco
Operation. wis only connection witir the latter was
when people from, ae believes, tie Far iast operational
unit inquired of him avout the wew York operation.
because Rocca knew little of tne operation, he referred
tnem to Security.

Rocca knew nothing of tnis operation at the

tion relating to foreign contacts of uissidents in this
country would be ovtained and analyzed. ie recalls that

On the second floor and established his own operation
somewhere else in. the building.

When Rocca became Angleton's ueputy, the
project had already been established and was fundeu
through tne regular staff budget. Rocca never saw any
of the substance of the project. tis only connection
with it was signing authorizations for expenses upon
Ober's request. Ober did not explain what the expenses
were for. ‘his was typical where, as here, the operation
was fully compartmented.

Althougn Rocca was generally in charge of
staff briefings on projects, he did not brief on this
project. ‘ine briefing was done by Ober of any personnel
who naa the need to know.

helms on this project. ne uid not deal through Rocca,

Rocca said that this project was simply not within his
duties as a deputy, anda that he did not exceed the scope
of his assignment as a deputy.

contact with any local police to the extent that such

Rocca said that ae was aware of only four
areas in which CI presently operates in the United States.

1. CI nandles four Sovict or bloc defectors
in the United States. For example, CI has a man on the
fast Coase who is a retired annuitant acting as a local
handler of a defector,

2. CI has various consultants on projects
doing work in the United States. ‘these are people
actually working under a contract with CIA, For example,
a woman is currently working part time on a book relating
to the use of disinformation. ‘the contract relating to
preparation of tnis book calls only for its publication
abroad, and a foreign publishing nouse has agreed to the
publication.

3. CI has twenty former agents who previously
worked abroad, now acting under military cover in the
United States analyzing the Sovict press for relevant
intelligence information.

4. lI has several people who may not be CIA
personnel reporting on their contacts with Soviets.
woth in the United States and abroad, these people may
also report on their contacts with people abroad who,
in turn, have contacts with the Soviets.

a fraud. se thinks tnat the informant must have been a
person fraudaulently posiny as a former CIA agent because
the information contained in the article is, according
to Rocca, not only incorrect but does not even make sense
in the context of the CIA. Rocca could not elaborate on
exactly what he meant but strongly suggestea that we talk

seemed apparent to me that Rocca must nave spoken to
hood and did not want to incorrectly interpret what liood

Based On the above discussion, Rocca said
that he felt it was important tnat a Federal law be
enacted which makes it a crime for a CIA employee or
former employee to reveal classified information which
he learns in the course of nis activities. Rocca said
tnat it was ironic that such laws existeu for other
agencies but not for tne CIA.

Rocca also referred to the iiersh article of
January 10, 1975, relating to the possible destruction
of CIA files. Rocca said that contrary to the implication
in the article that files might be uestroyed, he personally
wrote a memorandum stating that no files should be
destroyed under any circumstances given the existence
of the present investigations. Rocca will provide a
copy of that memorandum,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Leaving CIA - Raymond G. Rocca's Story

1. The immediate background of Mr. Rocca's departure
from CIA was a brief discussion between Mr. Angleton and
Mr. Colby late in the afternoon of 20 December 1974. The
gist of the discussion was related to Mr. Rocca by
Mr. Angleton at around 1800 hours when Mr. Rocca was

summoned to Mr. Angleton's office.

Mr. Angleton said Mr. Colby, after referring
to a forthcoming article by Mr. Hersh, which,
however, had not exercised a determining influence
in his decision, had asked Mr. Angleton to leave
his position as chief and take the advantages of
retirement. In response to Mr. Angleton's question
about a successor, the DCI said he had not given
any thought to that, but had named three individuals,
presently overseas, as examples off the top of his

head. Mr. Angleton, as Mr. Rocca understood it from

Chachi Fol

fo TSU ISAZ
OLets “/
ah: RQI26157


him, asked the DCI whether the leadership
possibilities were extendable to Mr. Rocca or
Mr. Miler and was told, "that was negotiable."
It was stipulated that further discussion should
take place with the DDO, Mr. Nelson, and only

Mr. Rocca would be informed at that stage.

2. On Saturday, the 2lst, Mr. Angleton telephoned
Mr. Rocca and expressed the view--with which Mr. Rocca
agreed--that he should ask Mr. Nelson to enlarge the range

of discussion by including Mr. Miler.

3. Mr. Hersh's piece, falsely accusing CIA of running
a massive domestic surveillance operation, appeared on

22 December.

4. At. 1000, Monday, 23 December, Mr. Miler and

Mr. Rocca were asked to accompany Mr. Angleton to a meeting
in Mr. Nelson's office. Mr. Nelson's deputy, Mr. Blee,

was present. The discussion took place under considerable
time pressure because as the meeting went on, it became
clear that a Special DDO Staff Meeting had been called for
1100, at which, presumably, the results of the discussion
underway would be announced. Among other details there

was an extensive discussion between Mr. Angleton and

IZLE cae
Fe TS 7G S27
OL Obs wy


Mr. Nelson on two points:

a. By Mr. Angleton. That it would be a mistake
to retire him at that stage because it would be
universally interpreted as an admission of the New
York Times story. Also Mr. Angleton reviewed the items
of upcoming business that had already been programmed

in sensitive CI matters for January and February.

b. By Mr. Nelson. The absolute necessity to take
action necessary to assure the integrity of the investi-

gations which were to be foreseen.

Mr. Angleton's removal as cued é aT ies assumed in this
discussion, presumably by derivation from the Friday talk
with the Director. Mr. Angleton reviewed the merits of
having the succession in the staff passed to Mr. Rocca and/or

to Mr. Miler.

5S. At a certain point Mr. Nelson asked what did
Mr. Rocca and Mr. Miler want to do. (It will be recognized
that there was, under the circumstances, no chance for
consultations, and, actually, no possibility of considered
thought.) Mr. Nelson’ did not offer either of these men the
succession to Mr. Angleton, neither did he ask Mr. Rocca

(or Mr. Miler) to leave the Agency. He did request that

Fe TS MISIP

they stay on in their positions for a transition period.

6. Mr. Rocca, in the absence of any indication of
interest by Mr. Nelson in him as successor, stated he was
not desireous of remaining on in any task other than
counterintelligence. He would be willing to stay on for
the transition--under a contract, which Mr. Nelson had
stated would be possible-~for whatever time was necessary,
and therefore he too would retire by 31 December, bearing
in mind the advantage of the joint cost-of-living increases

of 31 December and 30 June 1974.

7. To sum up, Mr. Rocca would not have retired on
31 December 1974 had he been offered the command succession.
(That, as he understood it, would have been Mr. Angleton's
wish.) He was not made the offer. As he saw it, under the
circumstances, there was really no other option to retire-

ment in the interest of the CI function or in his own

interest.

RAYMOND G. ROCCA
(Former Deputy Chief, Counterintelligence Staff)

Background

Mr. Rocca joined the Counterintelligence (CI)
Staff of the CIA in 1955, having previously served
in Italy as a member of the X2 Unit of the OSS. The
chief of his unit in the OSS had been Mr. Angleton.

Upon joining the CI Staff, Rocca became a
Member of its research and analysis component. He
remained in that capacity until 1969, when he became
Deputy Chief of the CI Staff, under Mr. Angleton.

Mail Intercept Program

Rocca knew nothing of the program at all until
1960 when R and A commenced receiving through COMINT

program was highly compartmented.

When Rocca became Angleton's Deputy in 1969,
he learned more concerning the existence of the
project. He understood that it was a special project
producing high-grade information on the main adversary.
The project was handled, insofar as CI was involved,
by the Special Investigations group.

Rocca was not responsible on a day-to-day
basis for the project even after he became Deputy.
That responsibility was given to Fred Hubbard,
Angleton's Executive Director. Monthly reports
from the project would come to Rocca at which time
he reviewed them briefly and passed them on to
Angleton.

In 1971 or 1972, however, Rocca had to
"defend" the project to Karamessines, the Deputy

stituted, in essence, an annual review by the Deputy
Director of all significant projects in which CI was
involved. The task fell to Rocca because Angleton
was then on vacation. Hubbard and others involved

Rocca has no specific knowledge of the
part of the operation which occurred in the
New York City Post Office. This was because that
aspect of the project was handled by the Office of
Security. In essence, CI was a "customer" of the
Office of Security. In addition, CI analyzed the
materials and distributed them to the appropriate
recipients. Angleton determined who would receive
the materials.

In July, 1973, Rocca was assigned to wind
down the operation, after the DCI had determined to
t rageie P a the physical location of
project within headquarters and arranged to have
the three or four people involved in the project re-
assigned. The work product of the project remains
at headquarters.

Dissident Operation

Rocca knew nothing of this operation at
the time it was established, except that he recalls
having seen the memorandum which specified that
information relating to foreign contacts of dissi-
dents in this country would be obtained and analyzed.
He also knew that in 1967, Ober, who had been under
Rocca in Research and Analysis (R and A) was assigned
to Operations, where he became the Referent for the
Domestic Operations Division. At that point, Ober
left the CI area and established his own operation
somewhere else in the headquarters building.

MR. WEIDNER: At that time was the counterintelli-
gence funcwion of the CIA just being established in a formal
sense?

MR, ROCCA: The question turns in a formal sense ‘
there had been counterintelligence in OSS,it had been indepen- |
dent under General Donovan, it had heen headed by Jimmy Murphy,
it had its own cadre, it had its own ciphers, it was an
autonomous part of OSS function, it was submerged as a functio:
to foreign intelligence during the SSU and following periods.
In other words, it became a subordinate part of what we call
foreign intelligence activities until late ‘54, early '55,
when it was finally broken out as a coordinate activity at the
staff level.

MR. WEIDNER: Was one of your early functions to
determine precisely what counterintelligence activities had
been going on up to that point that were not particularly
coordinated?

MR. ROCCA: Yes sir. One of our first jobs was to

MR. ROCCA: This is activity within the United States
with respect to defectors.

MR. WEIDNER: We will return to other activities in H
a more general sense. But you mentioned the mail intercept |
program,

When was the first time you became aware that such
a program was in existence?

MR. ROCCA: I became aware of the actual.content of
the program and of its existence in a formal sense on the 4th
of April 1960.

MR. WEIDNER: How is that?

MR. ROCCA: This fact is registered and I was able

to confirm by simply looking. At that point I was cleared
for the reception of material.

MR. WEIDNER: When you say it is registered, the
registration is the fact of your clearance?

MR. ROCCA: There is a card which indicates the name

of every individual who knows or knew.

possible,

MR. WEIDNER: You say you assumed that it was a

Dulles having gone to the Postmaster:General, it is my best

MR. ROCCA: Yes sir.

CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER: The reason I raised the ques+

this program was initiated back in "49, I think. Was it '52?
Excuse me?

MR. ROCCA: It may have had a lapse.

CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER: In a previous Administration.

MR. ROCCA: He may have had a lapse,

MR. WEIDNER: What is your understanding?

MR. ROCCA: My understanding is it was '55.

MR. BELIN: "52 or '53,

of working against the Soviet Union. That was the SP Division.

MR. GRISWOLD: Could you speak yp. You are talking

MR. GRISWOLD: Thank you.

MR. WEIDNER: When you started receiving these

MR. ROCCA: Yes sir.

MR. WEIDNER: What sort of a flow in terms of numbers
of materials would you receive?

MR. ROCCA: It was a very small flow of material and
none of it sticks in my mind at this time as outstanding in
importance to what we were doing in R&A. I have better
recollection for later pieces of information that concerned,
that is, for information in the '60's when we became very much
interested in the problem of disinformation ~- dez informatzia

MR. WEIDNER: You became Mr. Angleton's Deputy in
1969, is that correct?

MR. ROCCA: Yes. First of July I judge was the date.

MR. WEIDNER: Did you gain any further information
concerning the mail intercept program at that point?

MR. ROCCA: Not at that point. At that point in the

Chief of Research and Analysis, where my Deputy succeeded in
my place, I took with me a good number of jobs that I had
already begun on the research side and there was created an
executive officer and it was through him that the direct
oversight was continued in the project. Now, what had happened
is, more than what I had stated to you the other day, in
becoming Deputy, I did not’ succeed to the job which the
previous deputies had, and there had been two, Mr. Horton, and
Mr. Hunt, had had which was simultaneously acting as Deputy

at this time, and he took over the chore of direct oversight |
of the project though I remained 6n the distribution for
materials as they came in on a routine monthly basis indicating/
what had been covered in cryptic language, and I was in general
aware of the project on that level until it was terminated, and!
that was in '73, I judge. : i

MR. WEIDNER: Did there come a time when you hada :
discussion with Mr. Karamessinas, who was the Deputy Director
of Plans, concerning the project?

MR. ROCCA: I did. At one time during this period -+

MR. WEIDNER: What period is that?

MR. ROCCA: 1971 is my best recollection. During Mr.
Angleton's absence, inasmuch as it was my function as Deputy
to act in his absence, there was some kind of a question that
had arisen that required the pyvesentation of an indication of
the results as they had accumulated in the recent past, for
him, and to the best of my recollection Mr. Hubbard and I went
together to present these elements of proudction and security
review. They were interested in how secure was the project
and so forth. And I presented these materials to Mr.
Karamessinas in written form, as I recall.

MR. WEIDNER: Was it Mr. Karamessinas' general mode

MR. WEIDNER: But the processing of it, that is the
analysis, was done in headquarters in Washington?

MR. ROCCA: That is correct, sir. |

MR. WEIDNER: And that was done by counterintelli-
gence?

MR. ROCCA: That was done by a very highly compart-

mented small unit of Russian language specialists who were set |
up in a comintarea,a vaulted area, under every possible safe- |
guard, and they treated this material in accordance with their
skills, that is they translated or summarized or otherwise
prepared it,
MR. WEIDNER: Was that vaulted area in the part of
the building where CI is. located or was it in a separate area?
MR. ROCCA: It was in a separate area for most of thd
time that the project existed, as far as I know. They may
have started in 1955-56 in that area, in that timeframe, on
the same floor, but very quickly thereafter moved to the 7th
floor into comint area where a vaulted area had been prepared.
MR, WEIDNER: Was there any particular reason for that
Move, that you can recall?

that it was decided to discontinue it in approximately July
of '73?

MR. ROCCA: I did not, sir.

MR. WEIDNER: Did you learn of that decision?

MR. ROCCA: I learned of it.

MR. WEIDNER: Who told you? |

MR. ROCCA: Mr. Angleton.

MR. WEIDNER: Did he tell you why?

MR. ROCCA: The indication that he gave me was that
Mr. Schlesinger had agreed to go to the President to geta
top executive decision with respect to the contuance or
discontinuance of the program, that this issue had been raised
in a discussion between him, Dr. Schlesinger and Mr. Colby,
before that; that Dr. Soniseinege had agreed to take that

“action, Mr. Colby, or someone was to talk with Cotter, or
someone, whoever it was.

MR. WEIDNER: Who was Cotter?

MR. ROCCA: As I understand it, he is the individual
on the Post Office side who was actually handling it, the
Post Office interest, and he refused to permit the time
necessary for Dr. Schlesinger to go to the President. The
thing therefore ended sumarily at his choice.

been out of it by that time.

MR. WEIDNER: Were you told whether the impetus to

terminate the project had come from within the CIA or from
without? : |

MR. ROCCA: No; I was not. I jusged that there had |
been some difference with respect to the project inside as well

as out but I only know that by hearsay. H

MR. WEIDNER: What difference?

MR. ROCCA: That the decision as to whether or not i
should be continued or terminated.

MR. WEIDNER: Did you play any part in the termina-
tion of the project, that is, once the decision was made to
terminate it?

MR. ROCCA: Yes, these decisions coincided with the
decisions made by Dr. Schlesinger to compress personnel in the
Agency and as a consequence the first large hemorrage of per-
sonnel took place on the retirements that took place on 30
June 1973, and among them was the Executive Office.

MR. WEIDNER: And the Executive Officer is Mr.

pressure of the need of our comint people for additional space
on the top floor, and they wanted,: in other words, to usefully
employ the space we occupied, we secured new vault space of

MR..BELIN: Before you leave that subject, there may

be a question of two some of the Commission might want to ask.

You have discussed this entire area with Mr.

Angleton recently in interviews with members of the staff; is
that correct?

MR. ROCCA: Well, I read the attachment.

MR. BELIN: That Mr. Angleton prepared?

MR. ROCCA: Yes, ; |

MR. BELIN: Or was prepared that Mr. Angleton
presented?

MR, ROCCA: Yes sir.

MR. BELIN: Is there anything in the attachment with
which you disagree?

MR. ROCCA: No sir. It seems to me like a perfectly
complete narrative, descriptive account, as far as I know.

COMMISSIONER REAGAN: This chart that you gave us
here, we have some difficulty identifying them. How do we
estimate the increase in the number of agents, foreign agents
they have?

MR. ROCCA: These are official personnel assigned
here, sir, you see, and within the official personnel that theyj
assigned here on l6th Street. There is an institution known
as the Resident Toura which comprises those that work for

State Department and for GRU, Soviet military intelligence,

so these charts reflect the growth of Soviet official presence
throughout the world and in the United States, delineates in
another line, a solid bar, what wé know among them to be
security and military intelligence operatives, and then it

draws another line, which is an estimate, and it is a minimal

estimate, the 40 percent line, which we have come upon as the

result of the research that I have been doing for years, as

the minimal. And as you see we are falling behind in our
identifications both here and abroad, and very seriously
abroad.

MR. CONNOR: May I ask a question on this subject.

Based on your experience, was the substance of the
material that was obtained from these written communications
back and forth of value to the counterintelligence group?

MR. ROCCA: I consider it sir, mind you, I am talking
now completely as an individual who was not privy to the begin-4
ning of it and did not get into it until 1960, and therefore,
to a large extent impressionable. It seems to me that for the
‘50's and '60's this what may be called a source of strategic
importance for counterintelligence. AS to the extent that the
Soviets did not know it we had it. It was capable of bearing
indications that would have given us identifications not only 1
legals but of illegals and of other interests that the Soviets
had that we could get in no other way and that I could only

compare it to the overhead photography which functioned at the

same time and gave us another type or for a good part of that
time of strategic information.

This taken together with the six or seven defectors
that ame out in the '50's, who gave us living examples and
t

identifications, and the three penetrations that-we had going

in the ‘50's of the Soviets, they were Popov, and Penkovsky, ark
GoyeneveSKi, three people working inside those surfaces over a |
period of time from '53 to '61. We had the foundation of a
strategy response to the Soviet threat and all you have
to do is to read the '60's and you read the results because
at no time in the history of Soviet intelligence and counter-
intelligence have they been hit so hard as in the decade of
the '60's. We got Blake in '61. We got Philby in '63. We
got Pak, these are two UK fellows, Vassil, another UK one, in
‘64. Pak in France in '64. Felfe, the Chief of German
Counterintelligence, West German, about the same time. There
are a number of NATO cases that grew out, all of them, of this |
combination of what I call strategic CI weaponry. Defectors,
penetrations and unfortunately all of these penetrations were
compromised. Penkovsky was tried and shot, Popov was tried
and shot. Only one got away, and that is Goyenevsky.

So I would say that this was an extraordinary resourde
particularly in view of the way it was handled for counter-
intelligence. I can't go beyond that because, as I say, I

don't know where every distribution went to the Bureau, how

data and can gauge it for yourself. To me it was part and
parcel of an advantage which was extraordinary and it hurts

me to talk about it now,

MR. GRISWOLD: What was the relation of this to the
defectors. I haven't found that connection.

MR. ROCCA: Well, a defector will talk about collec- |
tion by true name and in some instances in this project, in
this material, we found that individual writing to people here,
and so by that kind of correlation of identification of names,
the project makes its contribution to an ongoing lead which
began with a defector. So that the idea of backing up
operations with research involves using all of these tools
against the target.

That is a specific example that I can recall offhand.

COMMISSIONER CORBIN: You have given an example of
mail coming from USSR. What about mail originating in the
United States?

MR. ROCCA: As I say, the stuff I saw came from the
USSR. I can't make anything out of the other at all because
I was not that close to it.

substantial than the mail intercept program; isn't that true?

MR. ROCCA: I can't argue the merit really in that, |
with that fineness of degree of detail because they were laid !

COMMISSIONER BELIN: To follow through the question
Mr. Corbin asked, was there anything that you can specifically
remember that was gleaned from intercepting the mail of an
American citizen going to the Soviet Union?

MR. ROCCA: I have not that capability, not because
it doesn't exist, in fact I think there are some specific
examples cited in the report.

COMMISSIONER BELIN: In Mr. Angleton's report?

MR. ROCCA: Yes. But maybe other witnesses could
clarify that.

COMMISSIONER LEMINITZER: You don't know whether
it went to the FRI?

MR. ROCCA: I am sure the reports were shared with
the FBI. I am sure they were. Sir, what I don't know is in
response to Mr. Belin's question, how important it was, whether}
they made any cases,that kind of thing.

At that point you were sitll in R&A; is that correct?

MR. ROCCA: That is right.

MR. WEIDNER: Were you aware that this particular i
project was being established?

MR. ROCCA: I was aware of it when it was announced
in the regulation. It was not discussed with me before it was
announced, before the action was taken. I was not privy to
that kind of thing as Chief of Research and Analysis though
the very man chosen had spent sometime in Research and Analysi
working specifically on machine records and techniques which
was a matter of grave concern to him, and interest. He was
specifically interested in developing and perfecting the
techniques of ADP control over data. I recall him, Mr. Ober,
a fine officer, who spent sometime in R&A before he went down
to OPS, from whence he went into this unit.

COMMISSIONER GRISWOLD: Excuse me. What do you mean
when it was announced?

MR. ROCCA: I would say there was an actual ee

unit has been created under the headship --

it was absolutely compartmented and sat in another part of the

MR. WEIDNER: There seems to be a certain parallel
between the mail program and what I will call the dissident

you want to call it that, somewhat out of the ordinary. Is
that a fair statement?

MR. ROCCA: Yes, I think that is probably a fair
statement and in both instances I think the differences pertain
to the sensitivity of the activity.

one concerning the propriety of the dissident program? .

MR. ROCCA: No, I would never have thought of it as
being improper. The National Security Act in its provisions
with respect to limitations on our powers does not proscribe
that we live in another country in doing our .operations and

to the contrary, that Mr. Ober's activity, the activity of

MR. WEIDNER: You say that is your assumption. Do
you have any specific facts on which you would base that?

MR. ROCCA: I don't know Mr. Ober's operations. He
had them because, as I say, I know the budgetary line-up of
the period and, therefore, I am sure you can get them from him|
They were never explained to me under this need to know
principle.

One operation that I know is his, and maybe you
already know about it, is the penetration of Agee in Paris.

MR. WEIDNER: Perhaps you can tell us about that.

MR. ROCCA: Agee is a defector, an American intelli~
gence defector, as far as I am concerned, the only one we have
had, and he has just written a book that is going to he a
massive blow to the security and identity of our operations
in Latin America. It comes out in England, He was an
individual recruited in the late ‘50's, he operated in Latin
America in the '60's, and left us under what he himself called
very friendly circumstances in 1968 in Mexico City after his
personal affairs had become completely mucked up as a conse~
quence of the collapse of his marriage.

had made two trips to Cuba. The origins of his ideological
conversion, whatever they might be, in Mexico City, after he

left us, presumably, he went to the University of Mexico, he

had, as I say, marital problems, another woman, whom he has i
since left. I can't judge. But when he became by his action |
a threat we only had to point out what the nature of that

threat was and to assess it. It is, I am told, that the

confidence in Paris was Mr. Ober and this was one of his
operations, perfectly legitimate operations, as far as I am
concerned, because while it involved an American, I think,
maybe not maybe, it was in Latin American, but whatever, it
took place outside of this country and it presented us with
extremely useful information on the basis of which we could

assess the potential damage and intention of Agee, all of which

has come to pass.

MR. WEIDNER: You say this was a part of Ober's
special operations?

MR. ROCCA: As far as I know this is one of Agee's
operations and it should figure as one of the big cases.

MR. WEIDNER: I think you mean one of Ober's
operations?

done any surveillance of any kind. It has no capability to do
it or experts to do it, and we have a TO officer that was as

we are in direct touch with and to whom we move and from whom

Second, we have three consultants. These are

We don't buy all of their time, we buy some of it, and those

MR. WEIDNER: These consultants are U.S. citizens

MR. ROCCA: Yes.

MR. WEIDNER: Do you have any other activities within

the United States in which counterintelligence is involved? {
i

MR. ROCCA: We have a group of former agents.

These are people who work for us abroad that we keep under
appropriate cover here in Washington, official cover, working
on overt Soviet publication, that is things in the Russian
language, that they read and from which they extract infornat
dealing with Soviet intelligence and security matters. These
people have cover status: in official buildings, they don't
figure as CIA. We pay them salaries and we interact with them
I think that is the entire extent of it.

you maintain contact with other Soviets here in the United

Mr. Belin, if you are interested in it, en extent that you
seem to be, should be gained from someone who has expert
knowledge, and I think you ought to lay the question on for

in the course of briefings designed to keep me from using even

the degree of sophistication of coming in and discriminating,

extraordinary thing. It is going on right here in your back

That is the word that means the organized intelligence and

‘SECRET

Aide-memoire for the Commission on

CIA Activities Within the United States

My preoccupation in this discussion grows out of the
conviction, based on operational facts, that hostile
espionage, political action, and counterintelligence-~-in
other words, uncontested expansion of Soviet intelligence
presence, successful recruitments, penetrations, and
disinformation by the Soviets and the Bloc services of
intelligence and security and other conspiratorial organs-~

will increase during the period of detente.

The hard fact that KGB presence under Soviet official
cover has continued to increase throughout the world,
particularly in areas of direct concern to us like Western
Europe, Latin America, and Africa, makes it a matter of
urgency for CIA to devote a larger part of its energy to
that CI problem. The same thing has happened in the U.S.;
the remedy, through the appropriate Federal agency or

agencies, will have to be the same.

The fact that the KGB/Bloc services, including Cubans,
have continued in the past two years to undertake develop-
mental relations and have made pitches to and significant
contacts with American officials overseas at an undiminished
rate, that work out to one or more per week, is the
complementary operational element that underlines the
urgency for an effective counterintelligence response

abroad and domestically.

Overhead photography and sophisticated but remotely
Operating equipment will NOT, and never will, tell us who the
Soviet, Bloc, and Cuban spies are. This inimical activity
originates abroad and is no respector of our organizational,
jurisdictional, or territorial distinctions. As we are
presently organized in the United States, no one Federal
agency can hope to deal successfully with the growing threat
alone. This integrated, determined adversary can only be
dealt with by coordinated, innovative, and aggressive defense
through counterintelligence and counterespionage operations
which bring together the operational capabilities of all

Federal agencies invested with the problem.
