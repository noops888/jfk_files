RE :

GABRIEL MANNARINO, aKa

AR

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

By airtel 4/7/61, Miami advised that spot checks of the LOUIS

VOLPE residence,,

12850 Maple Rd., Keystone Point, North Miami,

Fla., were unproductive and subject GABRIEL MANNARINO not

observed.

Same airtel set out that only vehicle observed at GABRIEL

MANNARINO's house at 8919 Dickens Ave., Surfside, Fla., was

1960 Oldsmobile station wagon, Florida license 1W9966, registered

to BETTY AMATO. It is noted that BETTY AMATO is the wife of

FRANK D. AMATO, GABRIEL MANNARINO's brother-in-law.

on 4/7/61, PCI JIM KELLY, New Kensington, Pa., advised SA THOMAS

G. FORSYTH III, as follows:

Within the past two weeks,

the MANNARINO controlled horse-room

which had ben located on the second floor at 937 Barnes St.,

New Kensington, was moved to the basement of the Garibaldi

Bldg., Fifth Ave., at 12th St., New Kensington. This means

that this location operates as a horse-room by day and as a

barbout-craps gambling casino by night.

on 4/7,10/61, CIs and PCIs familiar with the MANNARINO activities

Kensington, Pa., were given the assignment of finding out

if the MANNARINOs use

a wire service

name thereof.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
