Thi ‘ommittee has queried former Commission and CIA

of the Calderon conversation was ever shypn to the Warren


Commission. The response @n both accounts has uniformly
been that the Calderon conversation was never made avail-
able to the Commission nor was its existence ever made
known to the Commission. (Rankin dep; Slawson interview,
Willens response to letter, but see Rocca deposition
wherein he states that he is sure the Commission knew of
it, Helms hearing.) In addition, the Calderon 201 file
bears no reference to the conversation nor does it indi-
cate that it was ever made known or provided to the War-
ren Commission for its analysis.

“tier, “The available evidence supports the conclu-
sion that the Warren Commission was never given the informa-~
tion or the opportunity by which it could evaluate Luisa
Calderon's significance to the events surrounding Presi-
dent Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been

that the above-cited domestic exploitation section was

of recruiting any person associated with the Cuban Intel-
ligence Service. He did recall that he had recruited
women to perform tasks for the Agency. However, he did
not. recall ever recruiting any employees of the Cuban
Embassy/Consulate in Mexico City. Finally, Mr. Ronis
stated that he had no recollection that Luisa Calderon

THE AMLASH OPERATION

During 1967, the CIA's Inspector General issued a
report which examined CIA supported assassination plots.
Included in this report was discussion of the CIA-Mafia
plots and an Agency project referred to as the AMLASH
operation (67 IGR pp. 1-74, 78-112). The AMLASH operation
involved a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA
eryptonym AMLASH/1) who during 1962 while meeting with a
CIA representative expressed the’ desire to assassinate
Fidel Castro (1967 IGR p.84). As a result of AMLASH's
expressed objective and the CIA's desire to find a viable
political alternative to the Castro regime, the Agency sub-

sequently provided AMLASH with both moral and material

inate Fidel Castro. (1967 IGR
pp. 80-94). The AMLASH operation was terminated by the
CIA in 1965 as the result of security leaks (1967 IGR
pp. 104-106). During 1965, AMLASH and his conspirators
were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting against Castro.
AMLASH was sentenced to death, but at Castro's request the
sentence was reduced to twenty-five years imprisonment.
(1967 IGR pp. 107-110).

In its examination of the AMLASH operation =o the 1967
IGR concluded that the CIA had offered both direct and in-
direct support for AMLASH's plotting (1967 IGR p. 80).
The most striking’example of the CIA's direct offer of sup-

port to AMLASH reported by the 1967 IGR states:



aay

~

it is likely that at the very moment Presi-

dent Kennedy was shot a CIA officer was meet-

ing with a Cuban agent in Paris and givinghim

an assassination device for use against

CASTRO. (1967 IGR p. 94)

The 1967 IGR offered no firm evidence confirming
or refuting Castro's knowledge of the Uftasu operation prior
to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Report
adés note that, in 1965 when AMLASH was tried in“Havana
court, November 1964 was given as the At aN wt
time~ee—whieh AMLASH's actions wersenbied eo tia support .
(1967 IGR p. 111)

The Church Committee in Book V of its Final Report
examined the AMLASH operation in great detail. (SSC,
Book V, pp.2-7, 67-69) The Church Committee concluded:

The AMLASH plot was more relevant to the Warren

Commission work thay the early CIA assassination

plots with the underworld. Unlike those earlier

plots, the AMLASH operation was in progress at

the time of the assassination; unlike the earlier

plots, the AMLASH operation could clearly be traced

to the CIA; and unlike the earlier plots, the CIA
had endorsed AMLASH's proposal for a coup, the
first step to him being Castro's assassination,
despite Castro's threat to retaliate for such
plotting. No one directly involved in either
investigation (i.e. the CIA and the FBI) was told

of the AMLASH operation. No one investigated a



connection between thé AMLASH operation and

President Kennedy's assassination. Although

Oswald had been in contact with pro-Castro

and anti-Castro groups for many months before

the assassination, the CIA did not conduct

a thorough investigation of questions of v

Cuban government or Cuban exile involvement in

the assassination. (Church Committee, Book V,

Final Report, p. 5) i

In 1977, the CIA issueged a second Inspector

General's Report concerning the subject of CIA sponsored
assassination plots. This Report,in large part ,was in-
tended as a rebuttal of the Church Committee's findings.

The 1977 IGR states:

The Report ‘(of the Church Committee) assigns

it (the AMLASH operation) characteristics that

it did not have during the period preceding

the assassination of JFK in order to support

the SSC view that it should have been reported

to the Warren Commission. (1977 IGR p. 2)

The 1977 IGR concluded that prior to the assassination
of President Kennedy, the AMLASH operation was not an

assassination plot and that the treatment of the issue

by the Church Committee was both imprecise and misleading. yak
: why?
(19771 IGR Tab D, p. 28) 7

Nevertheless, the 1977 IGR did state:



it would have served to reinforce the credi-
bility of (the Warren Commission) its efforts
had it taken a broader view of the matter (of
normal avenue of investigation). The CIA,
too, could have considered in specific terms
what most then saw in general terms~-the possi-
bility of Soviet or Cuban involvement in ‘the
assassination because of the tensions. of the
time. It is not enough to be able to point to
erroneous criticisms made today. The Agency
should have taken broader initiatives then as
well. That CIA employees at the time felt--
as they obviously did--that the activities
about which they knew had no relevance to

the Warren Commission inquiry does not take
the place of a record of conscious review.
(1977IGR p. 11)

It-shorhi-be-noted that Richard Helms, as the highest
level CIA employee in contact with the Warren Commission
Ola regular basis, testified to the Rockefegller Commission
that he did not believe the AMLASH operation Sesh
relevant to the investigation of President Kennedy's death.
(Rockefeller Commission, Testimony of Richard Helms, 4/24/75
pp- 389-391, 2) In addition, Mr. Helms testified before
cnefronnittee that the AMLASH operation was not designed
to be an assassination plot (Richard Helms, Executive Ses~
sion testimony, 8/9/78 pp. 26-27),

A contrasting view to the testimony of Mr. Helms was

offered by Joseph Langosch who in 1963 was the Chief of

a i . a + .
Counterintelligence for the CIA's Special Affairs state (tren

(hereinafter SAS). During 1963, the Special Affairs Staff

d

\
was the CIA component responsible for CIA operations di- Atel?

rected against the Government of Cuba and the Cuban Intel-

‘|

bel
ligence Services (HSCA Affidavit of Langosch, Sept. 14, oa



1978, p.1) The Special Affairs Staff was headed by
Desmond Fitzgerald and was responsible for the AMLASH
operation (Church Report, Book V, pp. 3, 8, 79) @ Langosch
as the Chief of Counterintelligence for the Special Af-
fairs Staff was responsible for safeguarding SAS against
penetration by foreign intelligence services, particularly
the Cuban Intelligence Services. (HSCA staff, , supra)
It was Langosch's, recollection

that the AMLASH operation prior to the

assassination of President Kennedy was

characterized by the Special Affairs

staff, Desmond Fitzgerald and other

senior CIA officers as an assassination

operation initiated and sponsored by the

CIA.

Langosch further recollected that as of 1962 it
was highly possible that the Cuban Intelligence Services
were aware of AMLASH and his association with the CIA and
that the information upon which Langosch based his. conclu-
sion that the AMLASH operation was insecure was available
to senior level CIA officials including Desmond Fitzgerald.
(HSCA Langosch Affidavit p. 4 supra)

However, the issue before this Committee is not
simply whether the AMLASH operation was an assassination
plot prior to President Kennedy's death. The broader
and more significant issue, as the 1977IGR has identified

it, is whether the AMLASH operation was of sufficient

relevancy to have been reported to the Warren Commission.



GH

In the case of the AMLASH operation thes determina-
tion is a most difficult matter to resolve. Reasonable
men may differ in their characterization of the Agency's
operational objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence it
is the Committee's position that such information, if made
available to the Warren conmission, me? have stimulated
the Commission's! investigative concern for possible Cuban
involvement or complicity in the assassination. As J.

Lee Rankin commented before this Committee:

..-when I read...the Church Committee's
report--it was an ideal situation for them
to just pick out any way they wanted to
tell the story and fit it in with the
facts that had to,be met and then either
blame the rest oft on somebody else or
not tell any moré or polish it off. I
aon't think that could have happened back
in 1964. I think there would have been

a much better change of getting to the
heart of it. It might have only revealed
that we are involved in all these things
and who is involved in it and who approved
it and all that. But I think that would
have at least come out. (Rankin p. 91

On April 23, 1976 the Senate Select Committee aes
Study Governmental Operations (hereinafter SSC) issued its <t a/
report regarding "The Investigation of the Assassination ae ae
of President John F. Kennedy: Performance of the Intelli- -
gence Agencies." This report set forth a limited study
of those federal agencies, primarily the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, that
provided assistance to the Warren Commission in its investi-
gation of the circumstances surrounding the assassination
of President Kennedy. In particular, the SSC examined
the relevancy of certain information pertaining to alleged
assassination plots by the CIA against Fidel Castro and
the withholding of this information from the Warren Commis-
sion. The SSC conclusions pertaining to these alleged CIA
sponsored assassination plots have generated additional
public and private inquiries regarding the substance and
quality of information reported by the CIA to the Warren
Commission.
During 1977, the CIA issued a report prepared by
the Agency's Inspector General (hereinafter 77IGR). This
report was intended to be, in large part, a rebuttal to

the findings of the SSC pertaining to alleged CIA sponsored



assassination plots. The Tificr response concluded:

1) That the SSC Book V final report “contains nu-
merous factual errors, both in the extensive
treatment of a selected operation (AMLASH) and
in a number of separate incidents that it pre-
sents";

2) “While one can make the point in principle that
the Warren Commission could well have broadened
its review to include the anti-Cuban programs
of the U.S. Government, in trying to make the
case for that concept, Book V of the Senate Se-
lect Committee Final Report went to such lengths ie
in its treatment as to detract from the point
at hand. It is difficult to characterize it

_ More generously.* (CIA 77IGR, p. 9)

The 77ftsR further concluded that the SSC Final Report

conveyed an impression of limited effort by the CIA to as-
sigtt the Warren Commission in its work. The T7her was in
fundamental disagreement with this characterization of the
ssc findings and noted that "CIA did seek and collect in-
formation in support of the Warren Commission. Additionally,

it conducted studies and submitted special analyses and

reports." (Introduction to Tab E of 77x6R) =

In order “t< furthe’ demonstrate 4the scope of support

provided by the CIA to the Warren Commission, the 77foR com-

piled a comprehensive listing of CIA generagted material
provided to both the U.S. Intelligence Community and the
Warren Commission regarding the assassination of President
|. vespect :

Kennedy. In this venue, the Committee agrees with the i
77 IGR wherein it is stated that

"This compilation (of CIA generated material)

is appropriate to considération of the extent

of the CIA effort, to the extent that it reveals

something of the results of that effort."

(77 IGR, Introduction to Tab E)

Therefore, in order to examine the broad issue of

the CIA's scope and quality of support to the Warren Com-

A
mission in both an objective and disciplingif manner, the

Committee has reviewed in detail the 77 IGR's listing of

The
Committee has particularly focused its attention on the
specific issue of whether the CIA or any employee or former
employee of the CIA misinformed, or withheld information
relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy from

the Warren Commission. In addition, the Committee has
attempted to determine whether, if the Warren Commission

was misinformed or not made privy to information relevant

to its investigation, whether the misinforming or withhold-
ing of evidence from the Warren Commission was the result

of a conscious intent to do so by the Agency or its employes,



In examining the Agency's comprehensive listing of

CIA generated material referenced above, the Committee has
paralled its review to the structure given to these materials
by the 77 IGR. In this regard, the 77 IGR details four
interrelated compilations of Kennedy assassination material.
These four compilations are:

1) Agency dissemination of information to the Intel-
ligence Community (Formal and Informal Dissemina-
tions)

2) Dissemination of material to the Warren Commission

3) Agency dissemination to the FBI et al regarding

rumors and allegations regarding President Kennedy's

assassination

sion on Rumors and Allegations Relating to the

or have been made available to the Committee in a sani- oe

Agency's denial of access and/or sanitization of certain

One must, moreover, give due consideration to the

Mr. Raymond Rocca, one of the CIA's key represen-
tatives to the Warren Commission during its investigation,
also characterized the Agency's role as one of full sup-
port to the Warren Commssion. Mr. Rocca, who served as
the Chief of the Research and Analysis Division for the
Counter-Intelligence Staff of the CIA recalled under oath
that Richard Helms had direeted—thats''«~ the ffbourns Pro cbive:

All material bearing in any way that could be

of assistance to the Warren Commission should

be seen’by CI staff and R and A and marked

for us. He issued very, very strictly worded

indications--they were verbal in so far as I

know--that we were to leave no stone unturned.

({HSCA Deposition of Raymond Rocca, July 17,

1978, p. 24)

Mr. Rocca added that, to his knowledge, Mr. Helms'
orders were followed to the letter by all CIA employees. eo

A somehwat different view of the CIA's role regard-
ing the supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commis-
sion was propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who
served as the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the
Warren Commission investigation and who was directly re-
sponsible for the CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's
assassination (Rocca dep. p.23), testified to the Committee
that the CIA made every effort to be as responsive as pos-

sible to Warren Commission requests. (HSCA Executive Session



sasteeo Ba feeeesy

testimony of Richard Helms, August 9, 1978, p.10) Mr.
Helms added further testimony regarding the manner in
which the CIA provided its information to the Warren Com-
mission. . He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-
mission). We would attempt to respond to it.
But these inquiries came in individual bits and
pieces or as individual items...Each individual
item that came along we took care of as best we
could. (Helms hearing p.10-11)

It was Mr. Helms' recollection that the CIA pro-

vided information to the Warren Commission,yon the basis
open G>
of the Commission's specific requests. Under o he

supported this proposition:

Mr. Goldsmith: In summary, is it your position that
the Agency gave the Warren Commission
information only in response to speci-
fic requests by the Warren Commission?

Mr. Helms: That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that
memory is fallable. There may have been
times or circumstances under which some~-
thing different might have occured, but
my recollection is that we were attempting
to be responsive and supportive to the
FBI and the Warren Commission. When
they asked for something we gave it to
them.

As far as our volunteering informa-
tion is concerned, I have no recollection
of whether we volunteered it or not.

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren
Commission requests on a’case. by case basis rather than

uniformly volunteering relevant information to the Warren

Commission stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's

it:
and Mr. Helms illustrates the acutesax we the Agency's

compromise:

Mr. Goldsmith: Mr. na@ns , I take it from your testi-
mony that your position is that the
anti-Castro plots, in fact, were rele- \
vant to the Warren Commission's work;
and, in light of that, the Committee
would like to be informed as to why
the Warren Commission was not told by
you of the anti=Castro assassination
plots.

Mr. Helms: I have never been asked to testify before
the Warren Commission about our operations.

Mr. Goldsmith: Ifthe Warren Commission did not know
of the operation, it certainly was not
in a position to ask you about it. oe

Is that not true?

Mr. Helms: Yes, but how do you know they did not know
about it? How do you know Mr. Dulles had
not told them? How was I to know that?
And besides, I was not the Director of
the Agency and in the CIA, you did not go
traipsing around to the Warren Commission
or to Congressional Committees to to any-
place else without the Director's permis-
sion.

Mr. Goldsmith: Did you ever discuss with the Director whe-
ther the Warren Commission should be in-
formed of the anti-Castro assassination
plots?

Mr. Helms: I did not, as far as I recall.

WERE e Mr. McCone testified that he first

became aware of the CIA's anti-Castro assassination plots

involving CIA-Mafia ties during August 1963. He stated
that upon learning of these plots, he directed that the

Agency cease all such activities. (McCone deposition, p.13)

snED teres

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated
Somat.

that the tentative conclusions Oswald's

that he had reacheg were derived from CIA

memoranda® of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

Mexico trip,

and,in addition a Mexican federal police summary @grof
interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination
with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sic} an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that safirson placed limited
reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there
is no indication that salfison had been provided the Duran

)ranscripts. In fact, by virtue of
Slawson's comments conerning the Meiftan police report,

¢

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran. # insert pz

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

it would appear that the Warren Commission,as of March 25

given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported
by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)
wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

spiracies, etc. took place.


..-In order to make such a judgment (that all reasonable

lines of investigation that might have uncovered other

motivations or possible conspiracies have been followed

with the details of what both the American and Mexican

investigatory agencies there have done. This means

reading their reports, after translation, if necessary,

of the origin of the photograph in question. Scelso stated:

"We did not initially disclose to the Warren

words, we did not initially disclose to them that we
had photosurveillance because the November photo we had
(of MMM) was not of Oswald. Therefore it did not mean
anything, you see?"

Mr. Goldsmith: »..SO the Agency was making a unilateral
decision that this was not relevant to the Warren

On March 5, 1967, Raymond Rocca wrote in an internal

response further revealed that

On March 12, 1964, representatives of the Warren
Commission and the CIA confered regarding the February 12
request for the materials forwarded to the Secret Service by
the Agency. (See Rankin letter of March 16, 1964 and Slawson
memo, March 12, 1964)

The’ record indicates that the Commission at the March 12
meeting pressed for access to the Secret Service materials.
Rankin wrote to Helms on March 16 that it was his understanding
that the CIA would supply the Commission with a paraphrase of
each report or communication pertaining to the Secret Service
materials "with all indications of your confidential communica-
tions techniques and confidential. sources deleted. You will
also afford members of our staff working in this area an
opportunity to review the actual file so that they may give
assurance that the paraphrase are complete." (Rankin letter of
March 16, 1964, #2)

Rankin further indicated that the same procedure $8' to

Helms responded to Rankin's March 16° letter on March 24
(DDP4-1554, CD631 and DDP4-1555, CD 674) by two separate
communications. CD631 provided. the Commission with a copy of
the October 10, 1963 CIA dissemination to FBI, State Dept.,

INS and Navy Dept. (SS on 22 Nov.) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald
and his presence at the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City. The
on October 23, 1964, CIA had

i



- 39 -

requested two copies of the most recent photograph of Oswald in
order to check the identity of the person believed to be
Oswald in Mexico City. Furthermore, the CIA stated that it

had determined that the photograph shown to Marguerite

Oswald on November 22, 1963 did not refer to Lee Harvey Oswald, FAIS

by checking the photograph against the press photographs of
Oswald generally available on November 23, 1963.

CD 674 reveals that on November 22, 1963, immediately
following the assassination, and on November 23, 1963, three
cabled reports were received at CIA headquarters from the CIA
Mexico City Station regarding photographs of an unidentified man
who had visited the Cuban and Soviet Embassies during October
and November 1963. Paraphrases of these cables, not revealing
sensitive sources and methods, were attached to CD 674. The
Agency further stated that the subject of the photo referenced

w
in these cables was not Oswald. It ® further stated that:

"In response to our meeting of 12 March and your memo

of 16 March, Stern and Willens will review at Langley

the regional copies.of these 3 disseminations to the

Secret Service and the cables on which they were based,as

well as the photos of the unidentified man." (CIA,

p- 116444 of notes)

On March 26, William Coleman wrote in a memorandum for

the record:

“The CIA directed a memorandum to J. Lee Rankin on March 24,1%

(Commission Document No. 631) in which it set forth the
dissemination of the information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

I realize that this memorandum is only a partial answer
to our inquiry to the CIA dated March 16, 1964 and I hope
that the complete answers will give us the additional
information we requested."

Coleman went on to state:

! “As you know, we are still trying to get an
explanation of the photograph which the FBI showed
Marguerite Oswald soon after the assassination. I
hope that paragraph 4 of the memorandum of March 24,
1964 (CD 631) sent Mr. Rankin by the CIA is not the
answer which the CIA intends to give us as to this
inquiry."

The following day, as agreed by Warren Commission and

Agency representatives, Samuel Stern of the Commission visited

CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

Murphy wrote:

“Mr. Dulles, with whom I spoke today recalled his
earlier conversation with you on this subject and said
that there were still some members of the Commission who
were concerned lest they suppress the Nosenko information
now only to have it surface at a future date. They
expressed concern that this could possibly prejudice

the entire Warren Commission Report."

Murphy responded to Dulles' statement by stating that
the Commission's concern was understandable but that the Agency
felt the Commission's final report should make no mention of
Nosenko's information. Murphy indicated that a possible
alternative would be to use language "which would allude to
the existence of other, unverified information on the Oswald

case." This language, Murphy contended, would permit the

Warren Commission to state, if challenged on this point at a

future time, that it had given consideration to the Nosenko

information.

continued:

"It was agreed an effort would be made to find such
language if Mr. Dulles is again unsuccessful in
persuading his colleagues to eliminate any reference

to the Nosenko information from the report. To attempt
this, however, we would have to know precisely in what
context the Warren Commission intended to make use of
the Nosenko information. This, Mr. Dulles will have to
determine from Mr. Rankin. He will do this as soon as
possible. He knows that I am leaving this week and
therefore, will contact you as soon as he has the informa-
tion he needs from Mr. Rankin."

Whether by design or as an unintended result, the

quoted language indicates that Mr. Hiies! au a member of the
Warren Commission, was prepared to compromise his position

with the Commission in order to supply the CIA, specifically

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's

assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named

Luisa Calderon

“Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man
speaking Spanish. © (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-

\ Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then
employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban
Consulate.
During the course of the conversation, the unidentified
valler asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa
replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callewent on to tell Luisa that the person

”

apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of
the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." . Luisa replied that
she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being
held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller
replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned
nothing else about the assassination; that she had learned
about the assassination only a little while ago. The

unidentified caller commented:


We think that if it had been or had
seemed...public or had been one of the
© segregationists or against intergration

let's say, the possibility that a sort
of civil war would arise in the United
States; that contradictions would be

Luisa responded:
Imagine, one two, three and now, that makes
three. (She laughs.)

the Committee has determined that the CIA did not provide
Calderon's conversation to the Warren Commission, thus,
even though the Warren Commission was aware that Calderon
had connections to intelligence work, as did other Cuban
Embassy officers, the vital link between her background
and her comments was never established for the Warren Com-
mission by the CIA. The Agency's oversight in this re-
gard may have forecb&sed the Commission from actively
pursing a lead of great significance.
x . In that cable Mann stated:
...-Washington should urgently consider feasi-
bility of requesting Mexican authorities to
arrest for interrogation: Eusebio Azcue,
Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal. The two

men are Cuban national and Cuban consular
officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary in Cuban

This cable does not state the basis for arresting

Calderon. However, the CIA's copy of this cable bears a

handwritten notation on its routing page. That notation
states: “Info from Amb Mann Su? Seg, Rush re: ...persons
involved with Oswald in Cuban Embassy.

Mann went on to state in urgent terms:

"They may quickly be returned to Havana in order

to eliminate any possibility that Mexican govern-
ment could use them as witnesses."

According to CIA files, Calderon returned to Havana
on December 16, 1963, less than four weeks after the as-
sassination.

Calderon, Azcue and Mirabal were not arrested nor

ee detained for questioning by the Mexican federal police.
However, Silvia Duran, a friend and associate of Calderon's
and the one person believed to have had repeated contact
with Oswald while he was in Mexico City, was arrested and
questioned by the Mexican police on two separate occasions

Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in
Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying
Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed
to be 1940 (Dispatch, » 1612) Calderon's presence in
Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,
1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to
the CIA's Mexico City sdStion and to the Chief of the CIA's
Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-
patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data
on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon
was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's commercial
office. The notation indicated that a report was pending
on Calderon. The Agency has attempted, without success,
to locate the report.

On September 1, 1963, a dispatch was sent from

briefing of the Cuban defector, AMMUG-1. The memorandum
states that AMMUG had no direct knowledge of Lee Harvey
Oswald or his activities but was able to provide items

of interest based upon the comments of certain Cuban In-

i telligence Service officers. Specifically, AMMUG-1 had
been asked if Oswald was known to the Cuban intelligence
services before November 23, 1963. AMMUG-1 told Swenson,
as recorded in the May 5 memorandum that “Prior to October
1963, Oswald visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on
two or three occasions. Before, during and after these
visits, Oswald was in contact with the Direccion General
De Intelligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa Calderon,
Manuel Vega Perez, and Rogelio. Rodriguez Lopez.

relattonship to the DGI was not clear. As a comment to
this statement he set forth the CIA cable and dispatch

for Cuba.

On May 7, 196¢, ecorded additional informa-
tion he had elicited from AMMUG-1 regarding Oswald's
possible contact with the DGI. Paragraph 3 of this memoran-

dum stated in part:
"a. Luisa Calderon, since she returned to
Cuba, has been paid a regular salary
by the DGI even though she has not per-
formed any services. Her home is in
i the Vedado section where the rents are
high.

b. Source (AMMUG) has known Calderon for
several years. Before going to Mexico,
she worked in the Ministry of Exterior
Commerce in the department which was
known as the “Empress Transimport."

Her title was Secretary General of the
Communist Youth in the department named
in the previous sentence.

ch » On May Yurther disclosed AMMUG's know-
ledge of the Oswald case. ‘4 ‘paraphrased AMMUG's
knowledge of Calderon as follows: é 7

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned about
17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to
Mexico, that she had been involved with an
American in Mexico. The information to which
I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...
I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange
that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from
the DGI althought she apparently did not do any
work for the Service. (The case officer) told
me that hers was a peculiar case and that he
himself believed that she had been recruited in
Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-
though Manuel Pineiro, the Head of the DGI, did
not agree. As I recall, (the case officer) had
investigated Luisa Calderon. This was because,
during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had
intercepted a letter to her by an American who
signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation of
Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so
I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-
dez should be spelled. It could have been “Howard"
or something different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love letter
but indicated that there was a clandestine-
professional relationship between the writer and
Luisa Calderon. I also understand from (the
case officer) that after the interception of
the letter she had been followed and seen in the
company of an Americali. I do not know if this
could have been Oswald...

On May 11, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum

_had elicited from AMMUG. Rocca proposed that “the DDP
in person or via a designee, preferably the former, dis-
cuss the AMMUG/1 sitaution on a very restricted basis
with Mr. Rankin at his earliest convenience either at

the Agency or at the Commission headquarters. Until this

gata takes place, it is not desirable to put anything in writ-

ing. (11 May 64, Rocca memo, FOIA687-295 with/4 attachments).

On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding
AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its sensi-
tivity and operational significance. Attached to Helms'
communication was a paraphrased accounting ae )
May 5 memorandum. (Helm's memo, May 15, 1964,” FOIA 697-294).
In that attachment the intelligence associations of
Manuel Vega Perez and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez ted
forth. However, that attachment kSkees no reference what-—
soever to Luisa Calderon.

Howard Willens of the Warren Commission, requested

Rovere fe

as a follow-up to the May 15 memorandum, to~teek-et the
questions used i nterrogation of AMMUG. (Dooley
memo to Rocca, 19 June 1964 FOIA 739-310). On June 18,
1964 Arthur Dooley of Rocca's counterintelligence research
and analysis group took the questions and AMMUG's responses
to the Warren Commission's officers for Willen's review.
Willens say lay S-memorandum. The’ only mention
of @lderon was as follows: "The precise relationship of
Luisa Calderon to the DGI is not clear. She spent about
six months in Mexico from which she returned to Cuba early
in 1s64" However, Willens was not shown th, 7 canis
dum of May 7 and May 8, 1964 which contained much more

detailed information on Luisa Calderon, including her possible


Be

association with Lee Harvey Oswald and/or American intel
ligence.
It should be noted that these memoranda of May 5,

7, 8, 11 and June 19 with attachments, are not referenced

| in the Calderon 201 file. Their existence was determined
by the Committee's independent review of other agency
files.
Thus, the Warren Commission ba as of 19 June 64, pwd

little if no reason to pursue the Luisa Calderon lead.
It had effectively been denied significant background
i information which may have impeded or prevented its pur-

suit of Calderon's potential relationship to Oswald and

the assassination of President Kennedy.
