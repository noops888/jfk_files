¢s Advised that NSA “shall oct for the Executive Agent in all
COMSEC matters set forth below" - primarily responsibilities for estab-
lishing adequate standards;

a. Defined COMSEC as “the protection resulting from all measures
designed to deny to unauthorized percons information of value which night
be derived from the possession and study of telecamunications, or to
mislead unauthorized persons in their interpretation of the results of
suth a study";

e+ Defined telccomuunications as “any transaissions, emission or
reception of sign, signals, writing, images and sounds or intelligence
of any nature by wire, radio, visual or other electromagnetic system"s

RSA prescribes Governuent-wide standards for the "eans of encryption ~
equipments, codes or other techniques = and only those approved by NSA
may be used for the encryption of classified information. HSA also
develops equipments vhere required. COYSEC equipments are available
today to encrypt all standard communications rethods - telephones
veletypewriter, high-speed data, television (black ant white only), even
computer-tosconputer transmissions.

: Hovever, NSA has no authority to require encryption; the requirement for
encryption is left to the agency head under the EO 10501. Moreover, they
are positively prohibited fron monitoring telecoumunications to deternine
whether classified information is being revealed unless the agency head
concerned approves in advance.

To date, there are no known teleconmunications techniques vhich would
Pernit unencrypted (clear) information to be transmitted cafe fron inter=
ception and from being read by unauthorized persons. As a result, the
< U.S. COMSEC Board end NSA moke the acsuzptioa that all unencrypted tele-
comunications are being monitored and that the information teing trans-
Z mitted 1s compronised. While this is a physical impossibility, there can
be no assurance that any particular transzission 1s not being intercepted
end read. ‘Therefore, liSA vill assuse no responsibility for the security
of communications which are not encrypted in an aprroved cryptosysten.

‘The White House Communications Agency (WiCA) is responsible for, providing
ell telecozmnications for the President und iv the white House, except
for communications to and fron the President's aircraft (Air Force I),
vhich are the responsibility of the Mir Force. WicA is orgnnizationally
under the Defense’ Communications Agency (DCA). She WECA program has not
been reviewed by the Bureau. Kenneth O'Donnell provides policy guidance
to the WCA and bas informed the DCA that no information on the size,
Progran, or budget of the WHCA is to be revealed without his authority.

There is a very close working relationsh2p between WiCA and X
aspects of COMSEC, including possible “caiprocising emanatic:,

provide secure cowunicetiqns for the President so long as he uses the
conmzercial telephone system. Unless WUCA can be informed of the specific
locations and people to whoa the Sresident wishes to talk about sensitive
or classified information, there can be no assurance that the conversations
are not being n~"itored- However, if recon communications (teletype,

‘The above describes the traditional CO:SEC problen where there is little
relationship to the “physical security" problex, except insofar as
Physical security te required for the cryptograyhic equipsent. In addi-
tion and nore ‘closely interrelated with the Physiccl cecurity problen is
the problen of “compronising emanations” or radiaticn. Briefly, these

are electrical or acoustic signals emanating froa electronic snd electro-
mechanical equipments. If. these. signals cun be intercepted, it is poseible
to read the information ‘eing processed by the equipment.

For a thorough evalurton, it ray be nuveusary, if thi white Kouse desires,
to request NSA to roniter white House consunications on a sanpling baals

On the ratter of clandestine listening dovices, the “So Special Comittea

the adequacy of tha Sucrot Sorvice procedures, equipment and level of
