INTRODUCTION

1. The KDFACTOR Project has been terminated because of develop-
ments reported in other éhannels, This will be the last of the opera~
tional reports forvarded to Headquarters and primarily a wrap-up of
developments to date.

OPERATIONS

2. The KDFACTOR Project supported two visual and photographic
surveillance points (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against ‘the
MHHARSH installation, Operations: from the KDLITERAL surveillanc@
point were suspended on 4 July 1972, the equipment removed on 7/July,
and the operator, KDFACTOR-2, terminated the same date, Operations
from the KDASSINTHE surveillance point were suspended on 28 July, the
equipment removed on 29 July, and termination of KDFACTOR-5 and his

family accomplished the same date. =

ADMINISTRATION

3. Oliver J, MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for
inside administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period,
Processing of the photo product was accomplished inside the Station.

PERSONNEL

4. The project included five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operated the KDLITERAL basehouse, XNDFACTOR-5 cperated the KDABSINTHE
basehouse with the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons
KDFACTOR-8 and -9, Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 have served BKTRUST in

their photo specialty since 1957.

as part of his termination agreement, until probably sometime in
December when he will move to ‘new quarters of his own. The KDLITERAL
Building Unit 15) is part of the KDVAULT complex of build-
ings which will be disposed of as reported in other channels, If this
occurs before December, KOFACTOR-2 will move at the time of disposal.

6. KDFACTOR-5 and his family will vacate the KDASSINTHE apart-|
ment o/a 31 August, KDABSINTHE is located in a building owned by
KDABBEY who plans to disposé of his equity in the property in the

near future.

PRODUCTION

7. KDLITERAL: Before being closed down, KDLITESRAL, through ‘
KDFACTOR-2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover=
age of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers, He provided an average of three rolls
of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his
visual observation of the target area.

8. KDASSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced an
average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source, for
information on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, especially |
“WOCORK-type” persons and political exiles. This segment of KDFACTOR
was also our main source of information on MHHARSH license plates

and automobiles,

9. In addition, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both provided detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. With the loss of this
combined coverage, it will be difficult to identity personnel assigned
to the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements in
and out of the compound. The two surveillance points also provided
periodic photo studies of the MIHARSH installation itself with empha=
sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi~
tions made to the communications antenna system,

OPERATIONS

1. The KDPACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRATION

2. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for inside
administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Bruce H. FERNALD, who previously handled the assets, is the alternate
case officer and would be available to take over agent meeting respon-
sibilities in the absence of MANKUNAS. Processing of the photo
product is accomplished inside the Station. Agent meetings have now
been cut to a minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery
to the consumer has been speeded up. ;

PERSONNEL

Be 3. The project includes five salaricd assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDLITERAL basehouse and has been employed in this capa-
city since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE basehouse with
the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons, KDFACTOR-8
and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served BKTRUST in this capacity since

1957.

PRODUCTION

4. KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the source of within-the-compound photo-

film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily visual
observation of the target area.

5. KDABSINTHE: Cperated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
100 rolls of film and ccntinued to be the principal source for infor-
“mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "NOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
_gsThis segment of KDFACTOS also continued to be the main source of
“information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.

“attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to

activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic

hoto studies of the MEHARSH installation itself with emphasis on
“@éverage of ary constructionchanges and any modification or additions
made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also
available to service special support requests as required, During
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and
a three-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE.

7. ‘There were no known problems, of security relating to the
project. In response to Reference’ B. request, we have reviewed all
phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound.
The project assets have all been with us for many years and have
established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the
area. All five assets, four in one family and one in another, are
extremely security conscious and have all been SGSWIRLed. The assets
derive a substantia
employment. and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever
necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional
safcguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that either
segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence.

8. ‘The only termination of a project asset in recent years was
KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the photo product from both
surveillance points. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated amicably in March
1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,
KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MHHARSH access
KDFACTOR-1 is a reputable physician with a wide circle of
number-of recent occasions he has been very helpful
when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background
information on people in the medical profession. Although KDFACTOR-1
processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact
Surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished
product was always accocplished by an outside case officer.

9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets.
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of
their respective basehouses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and ~5 are met weekly
to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing
and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick~
ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs. Meetings with
KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his
route of travel to his overt job. These meetings last only long
enough to pick up the prcduct, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,
rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans are on file at
the Station and have been forwarded to Headyuerters on both KDFACTCR-
2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and ~9 are members of KDFACTOR-S*s imme=
diate family and could be contacted through him using his emergency

plan.

gency that one of the present sites might be blown, and alternate

means might be required to continue the KDFACTOR coverage. . In
February 1972 an apartment became available in the same building
: complex which houses the KDABSINTHE installation. Through the
Cooperation of KDABBEY-1, we were able guictly to rent the apart-
font and install elements of the KDCALVERT team as residents. This
\ location affords as good, if not better, vantage point for continu-
ing photo coverage in the event the present KOABSINTIIE location
| becomes untenable. We are also exploring alternate locations for
KDLITERAL to solve the problem we face with this element of KDFACTOR

coverage (see below).

| PROBLEMS ;

‘ 11. The only known problem connected with the project is a
‘product of mother nature which 18 threatening the effectiveness of
KDLITERAL coverage. Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel

‘ planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to

‘ the garden. These trees have flourished and now have grown to the
point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator, estimates he only i
has a year more of effective operational capability. We are studying Ly
ways of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatch

to Headquarters on the topic in the near future.

"_KDFACTOR Operational Report, 1 March through 31 August 1971.
RR RACE AHERT
ACTION REQUIRED: None; for your information and files,

REFERENCE : HMMA-40,227, 8 March 1971 (Previous Ops Report)

OPERATIONS: ‘ .

1, The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation,

ADMINISTRATION

2, Howard T, BAGAUS handled the administration of the project
until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the
Ops Support Section back to the REDTOP Section. At that time Timothy
H. ARCHBCLD assumed the inside admioistrative chores, and agent
meotings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H.
_FERNALD sho had previously handled the assets. When ARCHBOLD de-
parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J, MANKUNAS assumed his responsi-
bilities. MANKUNAS also took over agent meetings when FERNALD left
on home leave on 25 June and will continue to handle the project

assets in the future,

3, Processing of the photo product is now accomplished inside
the Station by Phemia B, CHAUVEAU, KDFACTOR-1, who formerly did all
the processing in an outside safehouse/darkroom, was terminated
amicably in early March 1971, and at that time the responsibility
was turned over to CHAUVEAU. The new arrangement has proven to be
more than satisfactory, Agent meetings have now been cut to a
minimum, and the processing of the product and delivéry to the con~
sumer has been speeded up considerably,

PERSONNEL
4. The project includes five salaried assets, KDFACTOR-2

operates the KDLITERAL base house and has been employed in this
capacity Since 1957, KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE base house

with the assistance of his wife, KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons,
KDFACTOR=8 and =9, KDFACTOR-5 has also served JKLANCE in. this
capacity since 1957,

PRODUCTION ©

5, KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL,
through KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the.source of within-the-compound
photographic coverage of PCS and TDY MRHARSHers, He produced 76
rolls of film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily

visual observation-of the target area,

6. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
167 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-
-. mation. on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type"” persons and political exiles.
This segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.

‘°.. 4, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
“attendance. sheets" on all: MHHARSH personnel, Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements and

activities,

SECURITY

8,. There were no known problems of security relating to the

_ project, The termination of KDFACTOR-1 should pose no security
problem: Contact was broken amicably, and it is highly probable
that he would be more than willing to help out again if his sorvices
are needed. Of the remaining assets, all five have been SGSWIRLED
in the past. They derive a substantial portion of their livelihood
from their JKLANCE employment and would thus lose a great deal if
security factors ever necessitated a termination of their work for
us, As an additional safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE opera-
tions are compartmented from each other, and there has never been
any indication that either segmont of KDFACTOR knows of the other's

existence,

9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets,
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom aro responsible for the operation
of their respective base houses, Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met
weekly to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHS product for timely
processing and analysis by the Station, Meetings with KDFACTOR~2
are car pickups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs,
Moetings with KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the
morning along his route of travel to his overt pb, These meetings
last only long enough to pick up the product, provide new supplics,
and pay salaries, rents, utility bills, etc, Emergency Contact
Plans are on file at the Station and have been forwarded to Head-
quarters on both KDFACTOR~2 and -5, KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are
members of KDFACTOR-5's immediate family and could be centacted-

through him using his emergency plan,
PROBLEMS:

10, There were no known problems connected with the project
during the repocting period,

FINANCES

11. The termination of KDFACTOR-1 and the subsequent elimina~
tion of outside photo processing costs accounts for the drop in
anticipated project expenses shown below for FY 1972 and FY 1973,

GENERAL

1. The" KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the period to
support two visual and photographic surveillance points (KDLITERAL
and KDABSINTH) directed against the MHHARSH installation and to
support the related photo processing of the product..

2. The Station is presently taking steps to terminate
KDFACTOR-1 the photo processor and move this phase of the operation

into the Station,

3. Primary responsibility for the operational and administra-
tive handling of Project KDFACTOR was transferred on 1 December 1970
to the Operational Support Section, and handling of the KDFACTOR
personnel was turned over to Howard T, BAGAUS on 2 December 1970,

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

4. KDFACTOR-5: This agent is met by BAGAUS at 0800 each
Tuesday morning at one of four different sites near the Anillo
Periferico in Polanco, some three miles from the Station. The modus
operandi used with this agent is basically the saze as previously
used by Bruce H. FERNALD. All meetings are held in the case officer
car, and after the meetings, KDFACTOR-5 resumes his trip to wark.

pharmaceutical”salesman for “paboratorios del Norte” or that of a
patient while waiting in the outer office. The waiting period
formally depends upon whether KDFACTOR@1 is in at the time, or
whether he is in the middle of an operation at the hospital.
(Waiting periods vary from immediate admittance to the KDFACTOR=1
office to several hours), The average period is about twenty
cinutes. A decision was reached in the Station to terminate this
asset and to transfer this phase of the operation to the Station
itself, $n the interest of speed, security, and cost. This
termination is planned for early March 1971, at which timé, the

processing will be done in the Station.

personnel at the MHHARSH {nstaijation took place, and KDLITERAL
played a leading role in assisting, the Station in identifying the

except in special cases when’ prints are required
quickly and are processed within the Station. LIEMPTY-4

office and he handles the work after normal office
hours. with patients,

2, Outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD handles the three
key agents of the Project (LIEMPTY-9, -13, and -'4). He meets
with each once a week’ Yor passing’ requirements, paying agent
and sub-agent salaries, rents and other experses, providing
supplies; and rotriceving the product. Inside case officer
Timothy M. ARCHBOLD handles the internal administration of the
Project and is the Station contact with FERNALD,

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

3, LIEMPTY-13: He is met by FERNALD ia the early hours
of Tuesday mornings at about 0730 in Polanco, an area far from
the basehouse, LIEMPTY-13 parks his car and walks through a
central park on Calle Horacio where he is intercepted within
a ten-block distance by FERNALD, driving his car. During a
drive together, instructions and product are passed hetwoen them
and, once a month, LIEMPTY-13 is paid his salary and the
salaries for LIEMPTY-14, -26 and -27. After drop-off UIEMPTY-13
returns to his car and proceeds to his full-tinoe job, thus
avoiding any direct route back to the basehcuse operation,

4.  LIEMPTY-9: After completing his sirveillance workday
from 0800 to 1500 hours, he completes his written reports and
drives to meet FERNALD at around 1630 hours, also on Tuesdays,
The location of car mectings varies but remzins within a quiet,
fairly secluded section. After leaving FERMALD, LIEMPTY-9
proceeds to his cover job at a brother's automobile dealership
for the remainder of his day, again avoiding any direct route
from FERNALD back to the basehouse,

5. LIEMPTY-4: After receiving the unsrocessed take from
LIEMPTY-9 and -13, FERNALD prepares instructions, as suggested
by log entries that accompany the take, and goes to, LIEMPTY- 4's
medical office waiting room in the late afternoon. For these
meetings, FERNALD appears to be a pharmaceutical salesman or
a patiént and gets to see LIEMPTY-4 only after all other visitors
have departed. At cach meeting, FERNALD delivers films from
both LICALLA and LILYRIC for processing anc retrieves the
processed take that, he had left the week before. While this
arrangement means that some of the product (those photos taken
soon after meeting With LIENPTY-9 and -13) are almost two weeks
eld when received at the Station, we have ast fotind this to be
unacceptable, When speed is of the essence in special
circumstances, the Station WOACRE technician can handle the
processing. :

7. During the period of this report, LIEMPTY-4 processed
approximately 142 rolls of 36-exposure film, Roughly one-third
_comes from LICALLA and the remainder from LILYRIC which
commands the better view and more trafficked approach. In
addition to this routine workload, LIEMPTY-4 was called upon
frequently for additional prints and echlargement of special

“targets or interest,

8, . LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA), in addition to his picture-taking
{perched for seven hours daily atop a ladder arrangement to see
above the heightened garden wall), regularly provides a detailed
“attendance sheet” anda monthly summary of NHHARSH personnel
activities. The photes are an indispensible tool in the day-
-té<day REDTOP operations program, providing photo identifications

* ef PCS and TDY-MHHARSHers and assisting to determine probable
RIS affiliation based on observed associations within the
compound, . The detailed “attendance sheet" helps in keeping
track of MHHARSHers present, their patterns and changes in
pattern of activities, ‘This information is cften the principal

‘tool in PBRAMPART activities, assisting in identifying the
probable MHHARSH coatacts of double agents despatched to the

1, With the termination of Raymond H. GiRENDL, effected ‘on
26 June 1970 ard described in HYMA-39129, 29 June 1970, the
LIEMPTY Frosect now consists cf the operations of the LICALLA and
“LILYRIC ‘photo base houses and the photo processing of LISMPTY-4.
Outside case officer Bruce H, FSRNALD handles all agents, normally
on 4 once per week basis, and passes the take te his Station
contact. Cperational funds are passed to FERNALD by his Station
contact, and FFHNALD pays all agent salarics, rents, and other
expenses. The eliminition of GERNDE has resulted in some loss
of efficiency, since basc heuse personnel cannot vegularly be met
as frequently as in thy past, This can mean a delay of up to two
weeks in receipt by the Station of photos, However, LILYRIC ard
LICALLA personnel have standing requirements to report by telephone
visits of Americans, and they are also alerted in advance whenever
pessible to forthcoming TDYs of NHHARSH visitors, so that arrangements
can be nade for special meetings and speedy precessing of photos,
Normally, all photos are developed anc printed by LIEMPTY-4.

2, As tar as the security problem 413 coacerned, the generous
termination settlement avarded to GRENDE has probably removed
whatever small temptation there may have been on his part to be
indisereet about his former asseciftion, Although GERENDE has
certain character weaknesses which’ emérged as a lack of dedication
and a feeling that he could get by with as little work as possible,
the Station believes that ho is basically not.an irresponsible
person, and that he realizes not only that he has an obligation to
respect security, but that ho also realizes that ho has, been treated
fairly and with great patience, ile has offered his services for
the future, and he was told that we appreciated the offer and did
‘fot want to lose complete touch with him, but for now he should
devote himself to getting a good job.

3. As for GERENDE's wifo,. LIEMPTY-19, she also appeared to
ye. grateful for the termination bonus which she had been granted
(and which she was told had not been carved out of what was due
GERENDE). On the other hand, she has less reason to be toyal to
JKLANCE, and her mental stability if Somewhat opea to question,
Therefore, she poses-a greater threat to LIEMPTY security than
doves GERENDE. At the same time, she knows much less about Station
operations and personnel than does GERENDE. Furthermore, it is
not likely that she would (a la Mrs. LIROCKET-1) go directly to
the MHHARSHers with her information. What she might do is reveal
to her lawyer that GERENDE liad worked for LNPURE and therefore had
incore to which she might fecl that shé is entitled, Since
GERENDE is no longar employed and therefore no longer has regular

- income (except for monthly payments of the termination bonus,
which she has agreed in writing not to claim), this threat has
also been lessened, Theoretically, however, she could expose
LIEMPTY and LIFEAT techniques (since she has been a LIFsAT transcriber),
put she could not, as far as we know, expose any currently eaployed
agents, with the exception of LIEMPTY-4, who is married to GuRENDE's
sister. (None of the above assessment uf the possible security
threat posed by LIZWTY-19 is changed by her 8 July visit to

JKLANCE Headquarters.)

4, There have been no changes in the functioning or activities
of the LICALLA base house, In addition to the routine photos,
“attendance reports,” and special concentration on the activities
of various individuals (most recently AETURNKEY), LIEMPTY~9
responded to a number of spot requests, For instance, it was
LICALLA coverage which was instrumental in helping to identify the

Also, when the AEKICK inspectors finally arrived early in April,

Satch for the arrival of the subject of DIRECTOR 042120, 12 June
1970 (and has net, as of this writing, seen any sign of him).
Perhaps the most useful contribution during the reporting period
was the updating of a sketch of the back of the MNHARSi Embassy,

The logs showed that ASTURNKEY might have made the first meeting,
but would certainly have been late for it, For the alleged second
meeting, however, the log showed that AETURNKEY was in the NEHARSH
gmbassy for the cutire pericd of the meeting (subject of MSXICO CITY
3389 latdr amended his story to say that ASTURNKEY had not rade

the sucond meeting). LILYRIC personnel were quick to spot the :
subject of MEXICO CITY 3542, 25 June 1970, making visits to the
MHHARSH Embassy, and reported these visits by phone even before

the Station had learned, from LIZNVOY, of this person's telephone
call, Several other visitors of apparent WOLADY nationality were

aJso routinely reported to local LNSRGU, along with a request for
license plate resolution if a WOLADY license plate is spotted.

Late in June, LILYRIC was alerted to report the possible visit of

@ person who had made a phone call to 201-087316, offering the

latter some “interesting information,". LILYRIC spotted aad
photographed a person who may be identical with the caller, and

attempts are now under way to resolve this.

6, LIENPTY-4 continues to handle all photo developing and
minting (except wher certain prints. ace needed quickly), and in -
spite: of his leg imjury, {rom which he is now vecovered, he did
not miss any deadlines. The fact that GeRuNDE has been terminated

7. The avove recital-of LILYRIC and LICALLA activities would
seem to indicate a heavy CI emphasis. Actually, this is not the
case, While CI is an important by-product, net only for ourselvas
but also in support of walk-in operations run by other agencies,
the day-in day-out bread and butter photo and fixed surveillance
information is of great importance to our positive operations,

TY Progress Report 1 November 1969 - 25 March 1970

Reference; HMMA-38119, 18 November 1969' PRIORITY

SUMMARY

1. The LIEMPTY Project has thus far survived the absence from
duty of its principal agent, Raymond H, GERENDE, as well as the
threat to the security of the Project represented by GERENDE
marital problems, Bruce H. FERNALD has been handling all Project
personnel since early December 1969, when GERENDE was deactivated
and placed on half-pay, No problems have resulted from this, other
than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to meet
LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GERENDE was), The security
threat will remain as. long as GERENDE's estranged wife has it
within her power to’expose GERENDE's RVROCK connection and the type
of work he was engaged in, She has continually promised not to do
this, and thus far she has kept her word,

2, The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the
Station. It continues to play an important CI role (particularly
for LNEPGO and LNREAD) but its gredtest value, as far as the Station
is concerned, is in the positive field, Two recent examples
underline this: The early (and thus; far only) debriefing of
AEMIDRIFF was accomplished almost exclusively by showing her photos
|_ of al] MHHARSH Exbassy personnel and getting from her a character

sketch on each individual. These photos were all obtained by
LILYRIC and LICALLA, Secondly, LIEMPTY observations (as opposed to

during the recedt operational activity undertaken against AESEASICK.
In short, LIEMPTY remains a highly effective and highly useful

operationally, not simply collected for the files,

GERENDE .

3. The GERENDE problem is unquestionably a serious one, We
are forwarding under separate cover copies of several memoranda
Prepared by. GERENDE, One outlines the history of his marital
problems, another describes the current legal Situation, and a
third outlines proposals for a-settlement, There is no hope of
recoligiliation, The Station’s position with GERENDE from the
start’ has been that he must agree to an amicable settlement with
steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations,
For this ‘reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any
financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, ai
that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that
Salary. GERENDE's wife. was made aware of our position on this, and
she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement
was strictly informal, The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
allowed to use his RVROCK salary ag a wenpon in the dispute with his
wife, because if he did, she could hardly be expected to refrain
from exposing his connéctions, Indeed, events have shown that
GERENDE's wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear
to her that she, as well as GERENDE, would lose money if he loses
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for
his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely
out of the picture. Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station
position was fair, and he said he would conform.

4, The attached memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's
opinion, basically fair accounts, In the beginning, the Station
was inclined to give GERENDE'S wife (LIEMPTY-19) tke benefit of the
doubt, largely because her description of GERENDE's character
weaknesses came as no surprise (particularly his tendeacy to
procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake), Early in the
conflict, LIEMPTY~19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
she could tell her lawyer about GERENDE’s salary. She was told
she could not mention the RVROCK portion undér any circumstances,
and that if she told anyone-that GERENDE had any connection with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied and GERENDE would be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it

level of GERENDE's overt income (GERENDS's monthly salary from
RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which
he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly),
Subsequently, LIENPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he
would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts
determined should be paid from his overt income, This, of course,
was strictly an informal arrangement, oae which would stop the 7
midis GHHENDE Stopped reseTving s seTSer> “Later, as LIRPTY-10's
joSition hardened and her vindictiveness began to rule her actions,
LIEMPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took for
.8n amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance
that GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in having him

jeopardized, While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had no
intention of- causing his termination, and had never breathed a
word to’a soul about his RVROCK affiliation, her attitude was in
fact jeopardizing his job and if he lost his job, she and the
children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income,’ Wer attitude is

doubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she became more and
more unreasonable, GERENDE was moving in the othor direction,

5. The outcome can still not be predicted. As can be seen

from GERENDE's memos, the two sides are still far apart on a number
_of points, including specifically-money, LILMPTY-19 insists on
10,000 pesos per month. GH#RENDE ts willing to pay 5,000, GERENDE

is currently on half-pay, Which means that his total (all source)
monthly income is around 14,000 pesos. From this, he would not only
‘have. to pay the amount which is finally agreed upon, he must also
contitiue payments of 2500 pesos per month to LIEMPTY-19's father
(paying off a loan obtained to build their house). The complicating
factor is.the unterftainly of GERENDE's future with RVROCK, The
Station has maintai for some time that it is impossible to
continue to payGERENDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA

and LILYRIC basehouSes, Now that FERNALD has absorbed this duty

With only small inconvonionce and some loss of timeliness, it makes
even less sense to put GiRENDE to work only to do this, GERENDE

has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and.
prior to the current personal crisis he had been told that he

would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order

to retain hie position, As Headquarters is aware, he had been

given additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well. There has never been any question of GERENDE's
ability, As wo have previously stated, he is personablo, intelligent,
bilingual and binational, and has had good training and experience
in certain fields, On the other hand, there has long been doubt
about his seriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition,
The "reversal of roles" which he describes in one of the attached ---
memos, which took place when he was confined to his home as an -

LP keeper, did more than cause domestic problems -- it apparently
deprived him of the discipline of a daily job, His well-deserved
reputation for being lazy was earned years ago,

6, The. question which must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE. He can be useful to the Station, but
the station has learned to get along without him, What are the
security hazards involved? The general range of his knowledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference, If all of this were blown,
the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations
against the MHHARSH target, would be considerable. The Station
does not believé that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
but it is impossible to predict what LIEMPTY-19 might do, particularly
since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, having already
lost a possible source of income through the termination, GERENDE's
termination’ bonus would probably be in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars, Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
two of them has never beon mentioned,

LICALLA

7. The LICALLA basehouse continues to function without changes,
except for the fact that Bruce H. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9
since 9 December 1969, Brief meetings with LIEMPTY-9 are held once
‘a week at pre-arranged times and places (well away from the MHHARSH
area). Occasionally special meetings are called, by phone, by
FERNALD, if special coverage is desired (as in the AESEASICK case,
for example). There have been no problems, operational or personal,
involving ‘the basehaise or LIEMPTY-9 during the reporting period.
LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporting period,
and in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of
MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage as requested, This
“special coverage" consists of his observations of a selected
individual «= who does he spend his time with, how is he behaving,
when was he present (or absent), etc, LIEMPTY-9 spends over 40

hours a week just watching (and photographing) MHRARSH personnel,
and ovor the years he has gottento know them, and their habits,
very well, Ho can spot unusual or atypical behavior, and when he
is asked to put a certain individual under close scrutiny, his
comments can be very useful, Nowcomers, no natter what their
cover, will frequently gravitate to their IS colleagues in the
’ "gafety" of the -MHHARSH back yard, thereby enabling us to make
tentative AEKICK or ALGRIP identifications, TDYers can often be
linked up with their internal escort officers. In the case of
Specific targets, LICALLA special coverage can sometimes give clues
to. personal relationships which can be exploited, During the reporti
peFicd we had special coverage on AESEASICK (to determine any
changes in pattern following the AKNIDRIFF defection and following |
the operation. against him -- anfin both cases LICALLA did report >’
‘some change in pattern); 201-305870 (for much the same reason,
although here the evidence was not as clear); AEPOLYP (to gather
information on his patterns and his associatious); ABTAKEOFF 7
(for the same reason); and 201-838166 (to find out if he did,
in fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were,
a requirement which was quickly satisfied), Also, LICALLA has been
asked to report on the arrival and activities of TOYers such as
the AEKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that j
“security inspectors" are expected -- he is told of the expected el
arrival of visitors, and he can spot a visitor or newcomer immediately) ,|
the possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to attempt to {
identify, at least by association, the person who went out to meet
an LNREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970). The
value of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Mexico City can scarcely

be overstated,

LILYRIC

8. There have been no changes during the reporting period of
the operation of the LILYRIt basohouse activity, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD took over the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from
GERENDE in early December. FERNAD normally meets only LIEMPTY=13,
at pro-arranged sites and times (also well away from the MHHARSH
area), once a week for pick-up of the filus and reports, He occa
sionally meets LIEMPTY-14 (LIEMPTY-13's wife) when LIZMPTY-13 may
be out of town, The LILYRIC coverage is a family enterprise ‘
with the work equally divided among LIEMPTY-15, 24,26, and 27,
who split up the hours of.duty so that there is uninterrupted

. coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays, (Extra-hour or week-end coverage may
be requested as necessary, and the LILYRIC personnel responded to
the Station request for such extra coverage during the AEMIDRIFF
and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports
during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy, Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings of HHHARSH officials,
up-tc-date’ recording of MHIARSH license auxbders, special activities
and visitors (particularly Americans, of whem five were spotted and
reported on during the reporting period), and some 3,500 photographs,
As an example of the value of LILYRIC coverage, within one week of
the change of license plates at the MHHARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting all of Nexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to
the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of the new numbers
(along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among
other things, this enabled tho Station to identify AESEASICK's
companions during his lust few days:in Mexico. Without LILYRIG,
identificationof the new license plates would have taken months and
would have handicapped our operations. LILYRIC has also provided
special coverage.of the visit of a Latin Awerican CP representative,
and is currently watching for the two AZXICK security technicians,
201-314616, and the man who went to meet the LNREAD agent. Also,

MHMARSHers undoubtedly assume wo have a LILYRIC-Like facility, and
act accordingly, are another vital clement of the RXDTOP program,

LIEMPTY=4

9, LIEMPTY=4, has continued to develop and to print all of .
the LICALLA and LILYRIC photographs, He has been met regularly by
Bruce H. FERNALD (taking over for GERENDE) since 26 Novomber 1969,
The firat- few meetings at that time (late November and early
December) were arranged by FERNALD by telephono to LIEMPTY-4 and
_ primarily concerned LIEMPTY-4's reports on GERENDK's family problems

ahd related security arrangements, Since mid-December, LIEMPTY-4 *
régimed a regular. schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at
pre-arranged sites’ and times. LIEMPTY-4 has boen given a special
extension inthe Station to which he may call as “Dr, Carlos" to
‘leave a message ‘for "Victor" (FERNALD) ,. FERNALD can change meeting
plans by directly calling LIEMPTY-4. The only personal problem

directly involving LIEMPTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required E =
his wearing a full cast on his leg for over six weeks. During

this period. when LIEMPTY-4 has been unable to drive, FERNALD has

been meeting LIEMPTY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC films

and prints, at LIEMPTY-4's office, under a suitable pretext and with

appropriate security precautions. LIEMPTY-4's services are

invaluable since the Station could not, on a continuing basis,

process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo lab,

SECURITY

10. Other than the security problems inherent in GERENDE's
personal problems, thore have been no security problems during the

reporting period,

FUTURE PLANS

ll, As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion
that he must be terminated, “This is not an easy decision to make,
nor will it be easy to confront GERENDE with this decision, He
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK. lowever,
as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able
to get along without his services. Furthermore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unaeceptable risk.
To try to molify her ‘by promising ‘her a portion of his salary is
probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her
attitude has progressively hardened, The Station, therefore, fe
intends to terminate GERENDEZ prior to the end of FY 1970, GERENDE's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per
full year, This would come to $8,750 (USD), For various reasons, 1
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably he i
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD), Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY-19 of
the termination, and, to keep her from revealing what she knows,
she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herselt, The
Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound from
a security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has
earned for this purpose, Therefore, while tho figure will remain
negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD)
would be a reasonable amount, Total obligations for FY 1970 in
the LIEMPIY Project are currently ostimated at slightly lesa than
$33,000 (USD), The Project has been approved in the amount of
338/970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (usb), It
is therefore requested that the LIzMPTY Project be amended for
FY 1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination, Funds will be available at the Station.

TO : Case Officer and Chief of Station

FROM 1 GERENDE

SUBJECT: GERENDE Background and Status Report
of Present Yarital Conflict

1. While this, {9 not intended to be a full exposition of my
personal and private life over vecent years, I would like to make
known some of tho factors that have, from my polit of view, led
up to the present siteation,

2, 1 voalize that the interests of the organization and the
interest of the ‘ndividuals who may have opportunity to come io
contact with my case Gictate as Little personal involvement as
possible ‘n the lives of agents, Indeed, the requirements of
security, compartrentation and efficiency prescribe the modue
operandi'and, to a great extent the ‘nodus vivendi, of agency
personael net only in the sense of earning a living but also in
manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
lisa, the better, but, as the years ge by, changes may occur which
go unreported or unnoticed and which may bring about unexpected
events ard repercussicns. When & person haf been worktag for the
Station, as T have, fer 1ifteen years with little or no personnel
handling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the
Job, and something coaes up like the abrupt sepsratica of my
wife (LIuMPTY-19) and ze with the perroual and potentsal security
risks it har entailed, J feel that some explanation is necessary.
Should it be in order, I would like this explanation tc reach not
only my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the
former Chief aa¢ officers with whom I have had the privilege to

work over the years,

3. J would like to give thanks, in advance, for the patience
and understancing that have been shown me thus far, Whatever the
final outcome, T know that pecple have been bending over backward
to be helpful and patient in hopes of an early solution to the

conflict,

4. Back in Septesier 1959, shortly after our wedding in late
1958, my wife and baby girl, were moved, by the agency, into a

SO TE per I fh - 27



ee oy

spacious, carpeted, furnished apartment near the DIZTAG Embassy,
which served intermittently as a listening post-basehouse for the
agency, At the time, LIE\WTY-19 was working as the manager of the
bookstore at the University cf the Americas and, at the seme time,
studying for a B,A, in philosophy. Those were happy tines, We
received a two-nonth leave, went to Europe, the Rome Olympics and
visited LIEMPTY-19's family in Holland, Back in sexico, when the

- base was in operation F stayed heme a lot (one of the requirenents),
minded the dial and tape recorders and the baby -= an unfortunate
reversal of marital roles. After exactly five years the basehouse
was closed down and we lost rent, LIEMPTY-19's salary and my
mother's salary which she had been receiving as part-time basehouse
keeper, My mother and youngest sister yave cousiderabte help in
taking care of the baby while LI:PTY-L9 worked and when we went
to Europe and left the baby with them, This was during the first
three years at the base until we had our second child, Christopher,

5, We moved to a small apartment in Loaas and, to supplement
the lors cf salary aad rent allowance, the Station began paying
1,000 pesos a month for the use of a dark room T had built on the
roof of the building, We had mr third child, Madeleine, unplanned,
two months after settling in the two-bedroom apartment, ‘The
apartment need not have bevn so small hut we had chosen it for its
Location and style and because it was to be a tenvorary stop until
we could find something better, We missed yoing to the Olympics
in Tokyo which we had planned to do (1964) and instead began
negotiating to buy a home brilding site at Rio Escendido but whea
the deal fell thragh, we decided to go on leave to kurope again,
this time with the two oldur childven, leaving the baby with my
sister, We visited with LIMPTY-19's parents in Holland (they had
moved back to Holland after having lived in Washington, D.C,, since
1943) and the two children stayed with them while LIEMPTY-19 and I
made side trips, Traveling is LIEMPTY-19's greatest love in life.
Upon our return to Mexico (I came back twe weeks earlier), LIZMPTY-19
was so depressed at leaving furope and being back in Mexico she was
enotionally and physically inaccessible for about six weeks, She
nad not fully adjusted to living 1a Mexico or to settling down and
becoming a housewife, Our cramped quarters, way of living, lack
of moacy, my job, my irregular hours and habits, my Friday night
poker games, the three children, all these got her dewn,

6, In the fall of 1965 after our return ‘rom Europe I began
ng English to beginners in the adult education program at the
American School in the evenings, This started as a two-hour a
week mconlighting experiment but by early 1966, through student
contacts made at the school, I had branched ovt to teaching at the
offices of Carnation Milk Co., Singer Sewing Machine, and
Richardson-Nerrell Drug Co. fcr a total of about tweaty hours per
week, LIEMPTY-19, meantime, waa working part-time at the Hamilton
Schoo? in Lomas where the two older children were attending, The
family finances improved and I was able to convince LIEMPTY-19 that

teach:



lan}

the best thing to do vas-to invest in land and build a house big
enough for our growing family which by now had a fourth child on
the way, With three friunds as partners, I entered on a land-buying
deal which turned out to be complicated’ as we bought the land in
the form of company stock, The company was liquidated and the
assets were distributed, as land, to the four partners. I paid for
our share with the proceeds fraa the sale of a small lot I had been
paying for since.1955, LIEMPTY-19 was at first reluctant to tie

us down with a house but when we finally got the papers and land
deed straightened out, she threw herself wholeheartedly into the
project and the building which began in August 1967, While LYEMPTY-19
fupervised the construction, I worked during Septerber and October
almost full-time for the Oly:pic Organizing Committee and the group
Zrom Czechoslovakia which came to train in the pre-Olympics, My
father-in-law deposited money ‘n Mexico to help us with the majov
part of the financing of the house. Ye ured $286,500 pesos of kis
morey and about $60,000 that LIEMPTY-19 and I had saved and got the
house tinished enough to move in in March 1968, We were very short
on furniture und shortly after moving in bought three bedroom sets,
an autonatic washer and even a piano, Naturally, cash was scarce,
dirt was plentiful, The yard was a pile of rubble, the carpentry
work had just begun, there were no closets, thy house was unpainted,
Theveaster, we did things on the ‘cuse as the money came in:
continued with carpentry, finished the driveway, put in grass,
built 2 fence and front gate.

7. Six months after moving in came time for the Olympics and
I worked, unofficially this time, with the water polo team from
Australia, LIA@PTY-19 worked for the month with the Dutch and
Belgian radio aud TV group. LIzMPTY-19 vas, once again, caught up
in the atmesphere of being among Europeans and doing someting
exe‘ting and out of the routine of hone aud children, She fell in
love witi the Australiacs a5 well, and for several months all she
ccvld talk of vas that we should move to Australis, T gave it some
thought but decided that we had ncither the money to invest nor the
youth and technical training to make it as pioncers “down under"
and, on the other hand, family, friends, a house, and job seniority

here in Mexicc,

8, Toward the end of 1968, LIEuPTY-19 decided it was time for
ne to move out of the master bedroom as she could no loager face
that aspect of our marvied life, For several months we tried this
tut it did not werk out for me, One night in March 1969 after we
returned home from a party, ske asked me to help her undress and
when she, once again, retused to have anything co de with me, I
got rough with her, prompting a decision on her part, which she
nad «lready been powering, to visit her parents in Holland as soon
as possible, Her father provided the plane fare and she! left in
April for the United States to visit hex brother and sister and
Holland, for what she said would be a five week trip, She stayed
naay ten weeks, ‘The four children remained with me, the, maid, and



Con

-4—

uy nether who came to“hvip three days a week, Upon her return,
ULOPTY-19 bore an air of resignation rather than of enthusiramand,

“again, as on her previous return from Europe, was physically down

end entally unhappy. When asked about her thoughts on Australia
she said that it she had wanted to live jn Australia, she should
have married an Australian, The separation kad nvt improved our
intinate relationship,

9. In Avgust I was to take five weeks’ leave and g0 with the
children to Astro-World in iouston aad visit my mother’s family in
South Curoltaa, When T suggested postponing making menthly payments
on her father's loan until December when the Christmas Bonus would
cover the back debt, in order to make the trip, she vas adamant,
saying that if I did nut have the cash for going, I should not take
leave. I borrowed from my iife insuraace policy and left with the
three youngest children, Adriana had a touch of aepatitis and
joined us three weeks later. After spending the rionth in South
Carolina, we returned to Mexico to find that LISM2TY-19 had very
much enjoyed her solitude, ‘We had already talked about divorce before
her trip to Holinrd in the spring, I had told her that 1 would not
corsider parting with the children and she said she would consider
leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well
as give her a substantial share of what she considered was her part
of the house. The title of the house was in my name and had been
since the buying of the land, LISMPTY-19mid I could mortgege or
sell the house but that ihe money was what she was mainly interested
iu, I told her that the sale of the house vas not financially
wise in its unfinished state and tuat the house and land are very
likely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years
considering the housing developments going on in the area, Added
to this was ‘he sertinenta] attachment to the house and area, A
mortgage, on the other hanc, for the amount of her father's loan
plus what she was asking, was something I could not afford considering
the mere than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in Mexico.

10, At the same time, during September 1969, that we were going
through the above-meationed discussions, LIEMPTY-19 was taking a
course at Japan Airlines te become a tour guide and group leader
for ¢rt s. to the Orient as early as November 1969 and, Soneeeeute
to Expo '70 in Osaka during the spring and sumer d 1970.
received a diploma to that effect. I told her th.t if she wanted
out cf the marriage and wanted to be free to travel it was all
right by me but that the children would stay with me and I would
continue to repay hey father at the agreed rate ($2500 per month
and 5 percent per year), She then sought legal advice frou an old
friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margadant who, ip turn, steered
to a young woman lawyer, Dra. Berta Martinez, who must have
advised LIEMPTY-29 that under the local legal system the only way
to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable support was to
hang on to the children becar.se LIEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face"
in her attitude concevning them and she now said that she could not



& : ~
“abandon” the children, I refused to visit her lawyer ith her
she said

saying I was not interested in getting divorced, wherea:
that ber :nind was made up and that we would have to split up.
i

11, Things came to a head on the night of 12 Noverber whea I
got home around 9 PM and she sugyerted we have a drink and talk
things over, I mixcd some martinis and she began laying down the
terms under which she thought ve should get divorced, i.e. I stould
move out of the house, mortgage to pay back her father's money,
grant her custody of the children aad support of 2,000 pesos per
rionth per child ($8,000), I said I would not get divorced under
those conditions and we discussed and argued in the kitchea for about
three hours, killing a bottle of gin in the process. We went
upstairs’ and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rouse the
children, unsuccessfully, and then tried to leave the house which
I would not let her do, ‘She got hysterical, phoned a neighbor,
Uta de la Hoz, then she rent into the front yard and awakened the
next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, and asked to go to
their hcuse. A few minutes later, Uta and her husband Guillermo
came and LIEMPTY-19 went with them to their home two blocks away.
\bout a half{-hcur later I walked up to Uta'’s to ask LIEMPTY-19
to come hume but wes told that she was busy phoniug her lawyer
and would not veturn,

12, The following morning I tyok the children to school as
usual and my sister Marcia (LIEMPTY-4's wife) picked them up ard
took them to her house where I joined them for lunch, LiiNPTY-19
came by in the late afternoon while my sister was cut, picked up
the children saying she was taking them home, failed to do sv, then
disappeared and was not to be found,

13, It was the subsequent action taken by LIEMPTY-19% in
dropping her lawyers and taxing on the services of Bernabe Jurado,
the most notorious penal attorney in Mexico, that led to the
potential security hazatds that ensued,

9 March 1970

TO : Case Officer
FROM =: GERENDE
SUBJECT: GERENDE Status Report

The present situation of the marital conflict between GERENDE and
his wife (LIEMPTY-19) is as follows:

1, GERENDE is living at his mother’s apartment at 99 Carlos
B,. Zetina Street, Apartment 9, He has rented a three-bedroom
. apartment at Tornel 2 corner with Pedro Antonio de loa Santos where
he-has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his
former address at Ladera 39, Lomas de Bezares,

2, The house at Ladera 39 is rented to an executive of
Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife,
and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality. The
monthly rent is 6,700 pesos K/N and the contract is for two years,

beginning 1 February 1970,

3. LIEMPTY-19 and the four children are apparently still
living at the residence of the Netherlands’ Ambassador, Barco
Schelto Van Heemstra at Pefia 360, Jardines del Pedvegal. It seems
fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana and. Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last
two occasions he has seen them, They have been there since
5 December 1969. LIEMPTY-19 has denied that she has a fixed address
and says that she is staying with "friends,"

4, \LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to use the services of Bernabe
Juardo as her lavy: + and, through him, is pressing for even more
advantageous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November.
Please see the attached copy and trauslation of the latest proposal
made by Juardo on 4 March 1970,

5. The charges and accusations made by LIEMPTY-19 against
GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:

a. Insults, threats and attempted homicide ~- this charge
rests at the 5° Juzgado Penal, 2° Corte Penal located at



Lecumberri, The judge is CRUZ Mellado, These charges have
not. been pressed since they were originally made oo 13 November
“1969 by LISMPTY-19, The ruling on these charges, should the
case come to trial, must be made by three judges of the 23 Corte
Penal composed of the 4th, Sth, and 6th Juzgados Penales. The
judge of the 6° Juzgado Lic. QUIRAZCO, an alumnus of
GERENDE's lawyer, Jorge Mario MAGALLON, Together they hav
on two occasions, been to speak to Judge CRUZ Mellado who
agreed not to issue an arrest warrant ani who has, finally,
called for a ‘hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at
10;00. MAGALLON bas given GERENDE assurances that the charges
are likely to be dismissed, :

b, Fraud -- this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her
lawyer on 11 December 1969, the day after GERENDK left the
Villa Obregon jail after having spent a weok there for
disobeying a court order. (The court order ‘had consisted of
an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house
and to have LIKWPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as
the temporary custodian of the children, GERENDE refused them
admissbn under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
judge's order, so the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,
on the spot, a 10-day detention. Subsequently, the judge,
LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
as incompetent, The judge-has had to face charges of
collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e.
Magallon and Jurado, The charge of fraud rests at Mesa 31°
of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal, The Public Ministry
Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
LIEMPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for
building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy
the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under
the separate property marriage clause md wrongfully placed

-.the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.
Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christmas 1965
in a complicated transaction involving three other partners:
Robert Bancroft WHITEHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and James
Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property
in thoir respective names with the complete knowledge of their
spouses.. Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen
months the deeds were issued, LIEMPTY-19 supervised and prodded
the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware
that the property was in GERENDE's name, In August 1967 when
construction of the house began, LIEHPTY-19's father's money
was used which he had deposited in Mexico for the purpose,
Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan
agreemeut, GSRENDE has been paying it off and has receipts from
LIEMPTY-19 to show for it,

GERENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")
pre-dating the construction of the house and the receipts



_ Showing up to date payment of the loan at the "Mesa 314,"
No further action has been taken by LIEMPfY-19 or her lawyer
on this matter but the. charge has not finally been settled and
ig still pending. The charge is, of course, unfounded and is
awaiting the proper "lubrication" in order to be filed away.

c, Neglect -- this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 in ~
Becember 1969 at the 7° Juzgado Mixto de Paz claiming that
GERENDE had abandoned LIEMPTY-19 and the children to their fate
and that they were utterly destitute, GERENDE was not
notified of. this charge and on 9 February after attending a

. hearing at.the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on
the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GERENDE, took
him to the Procuraduria and from there to Lecumberri, This
process involved being finger-printed and mugged, The
following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three
days later, 13 February, the justico of the peace (a woman)
formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidence. GERENDE and
Magallon went back on 5 March to pick up the bond money and
see if Jurado had appealed but he had not and, apparently,
that matter is closed,

6, On 14 November 1969, one day after LIEMPTY-19 disappeared
from home taking the children with her, GERENDE brought chargea
against her for minor lesions and showed. medical proof thereof,
The hearing of 9 February after which GERENDE was detained, was
called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA. GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LIEMPTY-19 denied it, the judgo ruled against her,
ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does
not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in

once a week,

i
7. \LIEMPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri.Street in San Angei Inn, The two older children
are going to school there. During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
school. -On three occasions GERENDE has been to the school at 13:30
to try to speak to LIEMPTY-19 and see tho children. LIEMPTY-19
has objected to this and the meetings mMve been short and fruitless
except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch
Ambassador's, GERENDS's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).

8, After the Villa Obregon judge dismissed himself from the
divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case
went to Coyoacan and Xochimilco respectively where the judged,
in turn, excused themselves from the case and it has finally come
to reside at the Ist Juzgado Civil in the D,F, The judge is Olda
CORREA (woman) and hag the reputation of being tough and pretty
straight. Since LIEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce
suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated
on GERENDE's part. LIEMPTY-19, on the otherimnd, has not had



GERENDE served with papers though his current address is known,
apparently because she is still seeking a voluntary divorce along ~
a, the Lines and terms which are stated in the accompanying set of
o proposals, GERENDE cannot begin to accept these proposals ia
their-present form as they are patently unfair and hardly a point
to beginning bargaining from.

8 March 1970

The following proposals were made to GERENDE on 4 March 1970
(Monday) by LIEMPTY-19's lawyer, Bernabe Jurado, through a@ mutual

been able to make, the said GERENDE is obliged to mortgage the house
at 39 Ladera, Lomas de Bezares in this city, precisely during the
course of the divorce procedure by mutual consent as established
in the antecedent clauses and before the divorce is granted so that
LIEMPTY-19's parents are reimbursed on their loan or on the out~

standing unpaid balance,
13, The expenses of making this agreoment a formal writ as

well as the fees of B, Juardo will be paid by GERNDE but these

will be fixed in an equitablo manner by Carlos Heyn to whose
decision both will submit.

14, In case of failure to comply with any of the clauses of
this agreement at any time or for just one time, either by GERENDE
or LIEMPTY-19, both agree to expressly establish the following

sanctions and terms;

15, 1f GERENDE is the one who violates any clause just one
time, he will forfeit the house at Ladera 39 ta the mother and
children, LIEMPTY=19, Adriana Juliette, Christopher Ramon, Maria
Madcleine, and Laurence Fernando, and said property will belong to

the above mentioned persons,

16, If LIEMPTY-19 1s the one who violates the terms of this
agreement for just one itme, she will lose the custody of children
in favor of the father or whatever perscn he designates for the
guardianship and custody of the minors,

17, Since LIEMPTY-19 has to establish an appropriate place
to live, in the company of her four children, both parties agree
that the household effects will be turned over by GERENDE, to
LIEMPTY-19 for that purpose, as well as the automobile she has been
using throughout the marriage,

Mexico, D.F,, 4 March 1970

SUMMARY

. 1, There has been no change in the operating procedures of
the two LIEMPLY base houses, LICALLA and LILYRIC, or in the use
“made of the product, Raymond H, GERENDE continues as Project
principal agent, and renewed attempts have been made to broaden his
activities, to include additional agent handling and the following
up of ops leads, After a slow start, some progress has been made,
fires GERENDE is now involved in divorce proceedings with his wife.

q

This situation is steadily worsening and represents a potential
‘security risk to LISMPTY and other Station operations,

GERENDE

2, As Headquarters is aware, the Station bas for some time
tried to get additional mileage out of GERENDE. The Station has
Nong recognized GERENDE's not inconsiderable talents: He is personablq
fluent ia two languages (to the point where he can pass either as a
Mexican or an American with no trouble), he has considerable :
experience in support activities, he has knowledge of the local
scene which would be hard to duplicate, and he is completely at the
Station's disposal, He has also worked for RVROCK for close to
15 years, in effect making a career of RVROCK, and the Station

t- believes that this long period of service imposes on RVROCK an;
obligation to see that he is fairly treated and provided with benefits
vhich would not otherwise be due an agent with less longevity, On
jee other hand, GERENDE has picked up some bad habits—he is not
‘punctual, his written reports leave much to be desired, and worst of
fall, he lacks drive and ambition, H

3. After several largely abortive attempts to get GERENDE to
follow up operational leads (and after noting, at the same time, a
fine job-he did in recruiting LIRICE-13), the Station decided to
Present GERENDE with what amounted to an ultimatum; Following a
six-week léave at the howe of relatives in the US, he was told that
in recognition of his past services he was being given a salary
increase ‘to $7,000 US per annum (which may not scem like much until
it is realized that GERENDE pays no taxes on this, and has the use
of a QP car, to boot). He was also told that -he would be given a
number of_leads to follow up (in some cases persons to whom he had
natural access; in other cases leads which he would follow up under
cover and in alias) ia well'as agents to handle (in alias), It
would be up to him-to take advantage. of this opportunity to perform
up to his level of ability; if he did so, Headquarters would be
willing to work out an annuity program which would relieve his
forries about eventual retirement. If he did not put out, he could
e@xpéct to be terminated by the end of FY 1970, GKRENDE expressed
his gratitude and his willingness to put his shoulder to the wheel,
: ct, he has dote.so. In October 1969 he took over the
f LIANVIL<l-from Oliver G. SCANTLING, and the Station hes
started to give him leads to follow up. His performance has improved
in every way~-his punctuality hae improved, his written reports
are continually improving, and he has made the effort to devise
approaches to the various leads and to start to follow up on them,

4, The Station was therefore highly encouraged, until 24
October, when GERENDE reported that his wife wanted a divorce, The
Problem is basically one of incompatibility of personalities,
exacerbated by the fact that GERENDE’s operational activities
resulted in his being home more often than a man who works a normal
office day, GERENDE's wife had taken a long vacation alone earlier
in the year, visiting -her parents, and the leave taken by GERENDE,
referred to above, followed his wife's return and did aot include
her. Both times GERENDE had the four children, Thus the news of
y the divorce request did not come as a real surprise, The problem,
} however, is that both parties want custody of the children, and the
#Wdispute becomes daily more bitter and more violent, The station
- J bas taken the position that security of GERENDE's operations must
, jbe preserved at all costs, hoping, of course, that the divorce can

> fee avoided, At this writing, the outcome cannot be guessed, If
ve the bitter fight results in the surfacing of GERKENDE'’s RVROCK
¢ employment, LILYRIC and LICALLA are faced with at least ame threat
* of exposure, The MHHARSHers are quite aware that a LILYRIC-like
facility exists; whether they suspect LICALLA is a moot question.
LICALLA is in mauy ways more useful, and the MHHARSHers could put

it out of business very easily by making their wall higher. Little
could, or probably would, be done to prevent LILYRIC from functioning.

W\.| __5. Other than LIANVIL-1 and the LIEMPTY assets directly
handled by GERENDE (LILYRIC and LICALLA personnel and LISMPTY-4)
other Station assets whose security might be affected by GERENDE's
\ current problems include LIENTRAP, LIRICE-13, and the PCM OP.
GERENDE is also aware of the fact that some sort of operation,
presumably technical, is or has been conducted from the LIMESA
KK mplex; he is aware of the existance and knows scme of the members
the LIEMBRACE team (LIEMBRACE-1, -2, and -4, among the curreatly
act and he knows of the existance of LIENVOY and LIFEAT. His
\ wWifeis LIFEAT-19 and has been a substitute transcriber as late as _

David M. WILSTED, and Rayrond'L. BARCENAS, as well as ‘current Station _
< Vinceat P, RIZZUTO and Bruce H. FERNALD (the latter in
is He has also met Andrew E, PELLEMENT, who used an alias,
Th his 15 years, GERENDE has worked in almost every phase of the
Station's support activities, and even though in recent years he
has been pretty much restricted to LIEMPTY, his knowledge of
activities and assets which are still current is considerable. It
is too early to judge the-outcome of GERENDE's problems, but the
Station is making every effort to see that security of operations
is not affected by whatever decision is reached,

9. LIEMPTY coverage of the MHHARSH installation continues to
be a useful tool in the Station's operations against the MHHARSH
target, One IA in the Station spends several hours per week processi:
the take, keeping mug book and files up to date, checking the infor-
mation in the logs against other reports when required (to determine
whether or not an agent or contact entered the MHHARSH installation
as claimed; or whether an ABGRIP or AEKICK officer was out of the
installation at a particular time, etc.) and analyzing the-LICALLA
production for insight into personal relationships, Useful
by-products include continual up-dating of MIIMARSH license plates
and observation of demonstrations outside of the Embassy and
renovations within the grounds, Furthermore, in GERENDE the Station
has been attempting to develop an outside asset with considerable
flexibility, who has been used to make recruitments and assessments
as well as handle agents, GERENDE's personal problems are placing
his own career in jeopardy and posea potential security hazard to
LIEMPTY and other Station operations, This is a problem which will.

SUMMARY ~ i:

1. There have veen no basic changes in the operation of the
project during the reporting period, Raymond H, GERENDE continues
98 principal ayent, handling the personnel of the two base houses,
LILYRIC and LICALLA, and performing other additional tasks, On
27 December 1968, consistent with our ettort to get as much of the
support activity as possible handled by outside officers, direct
agent-handling responsibility tor GERENDE and the LUAPTY project
was turned over to Bruce Il, FERNALD, Vincent P, RIZZUTO remains
as alternate and as FERNALD's inside contact,

GERENDE:

2, Until the introduction of FERNALD, there was no change in
the meeting arrangements with GERUNDS, Meetings were held on an
average of three times pex week until October, when LIEMPTY=-19
(GFRENDE's wite) was relieved oi the responsibility of transcribing
the Spanish-language portions of LIENVOY coverage of the BYDOX
installation, Thereafter mectings averaged twice per week, the main
business being the transfer ot LIEMWTY base house material and
discussion of base house business,

project remain a
until the latter

5 ination in August 8. He developed a good
relationship with

S\IN-5, and he showed that he is quite capable,
with proper case o:ficer yuidance, of providing usetul service to
the Station in the handling of agents beyond the support type to
which he had been limited in the past, The Station intends to try
to expand this rele, with due regard for security and for GeRENDE'S
limited experience. Furthermore, the Station stili bas every
intention ot using GSRENDE selectively in cultivation and development
04 operational leads, as outlined in reference. No such leads wore
found for GERENDE ducing the reporting period {among other reasons,
we have no intention o1 giving GERENDE a lead simply for the sake of
giving him something to do), but as soon as a suitable lead is
uncovered, it will be passed. to GERENDE.

4. GERENDE was particularly useful during the Olympic period.
While he did not-get-a job with the Olympic Committee as he had
hoped, his wife was eaployed as a translator by the European televisio:
networks who had come to cover the games. This, plus other personal
contacts, gave GERINDY a certain amount of access to Olympic [acilitied,
Both GERENDE and his wife helped considerably in the distribution of
AEEGGHEAD material, acd GERENDE performed a number of miscellancous
tasks assisting the Station in virious Olympic responsibilities,

5, GERENDE has also been used in support: of JNROD operations,
. Such as making mail pick-ups and delivering material and making phone
calls to AMBASSCON, Yollowing the Warsaw Pact Powers’ invasion ot
Czechoslovakia, NOX way asked to cover a demonstration in front
of the Soviet Sx» + and he wrote a good report which was used in
imbassy briefings, Recently, GERENDE has enrolled at the
University of the Americas to work for an M,A, in contemporary
Mexican history, The Station will explore the possibility of his
wetting access to persons or LnJormation of Interest on the University

campus,

LICALLA

G, LIENPTY-9's vork (in the LICALLA base house) was inhibited
in July due to the construction of a maid's rooa near his working
quarters, During the reporting period, however, he took a total of
2,217 operational photos. His regular reporting and commentary
continued as in the rast, LIEMPTY-y is a steady and dependable per-
former, and his unigue- vantage point remains the source of tne most
intoresting and revealing photos as well as often very informative

reporting.

LILYRIC

7. LIEMPTY-13, -14, -26, and -27 have been able to keep the
LILYRIC base house manned on a regular basis from 0800 to 1800 hours
weekdays and OS00 te 1500 hours on Saturdays, with other hours cover-
able upon request, Tnis has proven to be a iar netter arrangement
than depending on LINIT=D for some of this coverage, In addition to
the 6,703 operationai photos taken during the reporting period and the
daily dixed surveillasce reports, LILYRIC reporting is of considerable
help in compiling current vehicle and license plates lists, PCS arriva
and departures, unuscal activities such as,demonstrations or protests,
unusual or lengthy atsences of persouncl, et all of which have
obvious CI imports It was LILYRIC photos which made it possible
for LNERGO to iden the Subject of 201-841520, who had been in
clandestine contact witi ANGRIP officers, LILYRIC also reported on
a half dozen other American (or American appearing) visitors, some of
whom it was possible to identity through tracing license plates,

1. Some attention should be devoted, if it has not already
beea, to the dangers involved in this operation and particularly i
to what countermeasures the target may institute, or may already 1
have instituted. :

2. One current danger certainly exists, to wit, the exist-
ence of project Licalla base, vhich is in the group of bulldings
comprising the Limesa complex. One of the agents at Licalla
base'is known to one of the Lipstick agents arrested in the
suumer of 1958, and it is, hence, possible that both the host
government and the target knove of Licalla. It is suggested
that perhaps Licalls should be terminated. The reason has been
advanced that this should not be done since the agent would de
suspicious and in any event Licalla might serve as a red herring
for Limesa. It is believed that the Licalla agent could be
gotten out of this operation withcut arousing his suspicion. The
Station could mount an obvious tail on him; vhen he reported it,
he could be told he had probably been made and that, hence, the
operation should no longer continue. ‘The agent has been a good
one and could be used elsewhere on some other work. Licalla
house is going to be repaired soon. This might be a good oppor=
tunity to stop work there and let some innocent party rent it.
That would be a better red herring.

3. Concerning the manner in which Linesa houses vere acquired
by the Station, it should be kept in mind that the purchase mechantam
was identical with that used in Limited. ‘The vatchnan at Linited
knew an American owned it and told this.to vhat to him mst have
seened a casual visitor to the prenises when it was under repairs,

We should, therefore, assune the targets know an American owns it
and that it is blown. Therefore, ve should also assume that if
the targets have conducted any sort of an investigation of Lineca
houses, they may well have discovered that the same ultinate ovner
is involved. So far as is known, the bank vhich fronts for the
purchases has not been checked to see if any inquiries have been
made. We must agree the targets have the capability to find out
who the front ower is--the bank-- and fron there could possibly
establish the tdentity of the owner, Limousine. Limousine and his
firms have also deen. used as cover for other Station agents and
operations apart fron Limesa and Limited.

Se @ 717 fB



4, It should not be forgotten that a person tried toth to
rent and buy Limesa properties earlter in the year after ve
owned thea. So far as we know, @ check on this person vas not
productive of suspicious data, but the question arises as to how
thorough the investigation vas. Possibly the name the man gave
tien making inquiries vas false, meaning that in effect the right
person has never been invéstigated at all. Knoving that the
targets have in the past shovn some interest in the Limesa buila-
ings, it 18 not beyond the realm of reason that this man vas sent
by then. The story he gave for wishing to rent the house-~because
1t was handy and close to a certain school--is identical vith the
story used ty the Station to cover rental of Licalla almcst next

door.

5. ven granting that the true ownership of Linesa has not
been discovered by the targets, they have various recourses through which
to establish the identity and activity of the occupants thereof. ‘The
following possibilities suggest themselves:

a. ter into litigation with Limesa omer over exact

boundaries or otuer pretext, demanding property be
surveyed. On court order, Limesa could be inspected

thoroughly.
b. Undermine target side of Limesa walls, leading to

possible condemnation of property by local government
or necessity various repairs, etc.

¢. Sabotage of electricity (causing fire) or water or
sevage, necessitating entry into Limesa of outside per-
sons, who could be infiltered by target agents.

4. Reming by vehicle, with simtlar results, police,
firenen, ete. :

e. Complaint to medical authorities on filth, refuse, ete.,
leading to inspection by health authorities.

f. Various other approaches might be discussed.

6. One general recommendation can be made: sensitive material

should be used and kept in a. crypt, and a good one, rather than in
the relatively insecure special room now planned as the onerational

room.

7. Beyond this, every effort should be made to see to it that
the operators have good cover. The idea of clothing then in local

clothing is excellent and shows right thinking in that direction.

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI
REFERENCE : HMMA-33459, 8 November 1967

Summar;

1. During the reporting period, the project's principal
agent, Raymond H. GERENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed
at broadening his usefulness to the Station, These tasks
included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a
recruited agent, ERFAIN-3,% GERENDE did well, and it is believed
that a new dimension has been opencd for him, and by the same
token, the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset, The
LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate
and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper-
ations, The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIEMPTY-6, ~
were terminated on 31 May 1968, Termination was decided upon
partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur=
ably decreased the reliability and effectiveness of LIEMPTY-6's
work, LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC Base
House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC
and LIMITED had together in the past,

2. During the reporting period, tne case officer has been
meeting GERENDY an average of three times per.week. Meetings
are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times, Meetings
average 20 to JO minutes, GERENDE turns over to the case
officer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has
picked up from the base houses since the previous meoting,

alon; with bréef contact reports on his meetings with base

house representatives, Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc=
tions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge=
ments which may be desired by ‘the Station, Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting. (The departure

of LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber, As a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BKDOX transcriber,
GERENDE's wile, LIEMPTY+19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
Pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes, She docs tho work in her home, and GERENDKE transports the

tapes.)

3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for
the following LIEMPTY agents: LIEMPTY-4 (photo-processor; met
twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week until
termination); LIUMPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per wook =~ in his absence LIEMPTY-27 makes
meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). Ile is
responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling
all of the administrative problems which may develop. To judgo
from tho results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these xyents
ana is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them -- particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel,

4, As noted in reference, GERENDE was omployed by the
Mexican MIRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit,
His MURAVEL activity during tne reporting period has been minimal,
but we expect it to start picking up again, GSRENDE has cone
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investirations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and we have instructed him to try to fet
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL

delegation as possible.

5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had performed
Nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational
lead, and that the Station planned to five GeRENDE more of the
sane. Furthermore, GERENDE'S standing assigments (LIEMTY
hase houses, MURAVEN activity, and occasional support o: JMROD
requirements) were not challenging enough or vccupying enough
of GERENDE'S timo, GEREND® is rather firmly committed to
WOFIEM by virtue of the jact that he has worked for WOVTRM for
over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any
consequence, Ry the same token, he was, throurh no fault of
his own, dotny less work For WOFIRM than at any time in his
career, GiRENDE's h the years
dictated more and more vestrictions on his activity, for sound
Security reasons, The solution to GERINDS's problem (laci: of
A promising future) and the Station’s (not setting its money's
worth) sceued to be to give GHREND# additional tasks which he
could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security
precautions, Since most of GeRENDE's support activities had
been against the FJSTEA target, particular care would have to
be taken in committing him further in this direction, It was
decided, theretore, that his principal retooling would be in
@ non-FUSTEAL Sield.

G, In’ Line with the above reasoni GERENDE was introduced
to Anarew R, DOSCHER on-17 February 196 The idea was that
GERENDE would be “trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his
operations arainsf Central American tarcets, GERENDE's principal
duty, thus far has beon ‘to take over the handling of #RFAIN-3,
under IOSCHER's close suporvision and guidance, GERENDE has
perforned quite ereditably in this task, He scems interested
in the work and has learned quickly, On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting, If GERENDE can overcome this (and both caso
officers are working; hard to teach GEKANDE the importance of
Prompt end complety reporting) thefe seems to be every reason
to Believe GsRENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.

7. GERENDE was also riven the task of locating and developing
(in alias) a girl who, por LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT. Although GERENDE had to'be continually reminded of tho
assignment, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and
gaining her confidonce. It 1s quite likely that he could have
recruited the girl as an access arent against AFRODENT, but aé
this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was
launched and it was not folt that attempting to recruit the girl
would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least
(amoung other things, there was no indication that she had had
any contact with AERODENT for some months), ‘The only flaw in
GERENDE's petformance was the time it took him to get around to
doing the job. It should be mentioned, howover, that at tho
Same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to
attend to, including oversecing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though
construction is still not entirely completed.

8, Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the
reporting period wore the renting of an apartment for use as a
Listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian
translator working for the MURAVEL committee,

LICALLA

9, The star of the LIEMPTY show, as far as quality of
performance is concerned, continues to be LIEMPTY-9, itis
favorable location and his perceptiveness continue to result in
revealing photos and equally revealing commentary, In addition
to the 2,908 operational photos taken during the reporting
period, he has provided daily, weekly, and monthly summaries and
‘notes, Semi-nonthly attendance reports (of FJSTEAL personnel
spotted by him), various special reports, and special intensive
coverage of the following: 201-120123; 201-107668; 201-271102;
and 201-305870. As of 1 May 1968 LIEMPTY-9's salary was raised
from 4,000 pesos to 4,500 pesos per month, LIEMPTY-9 was also
given permission to have a maid's room constructed on the roof
of his apartzent, The original maid's room 1s LIEMPTY-!!'s photo
point, The maid, who has been with the family for 11 years
(since she w2s 10) eicher sleeps in the hall, where she is in the
way, or in the bedroom of LIEMPTY-9's nine-year old son, which
LIEWPTY-9 feels is berinning to be not a proper arrangement.

The room will be built at a point on the roof away from the
FJSTEAI., installation (so as to arouse as little suspicion as
possible), and the fact that the maid will be seen going in aud
out of the reom regularly Showld quiet any suspicions which may
arise, Construction work put LICALLA out of action starting

24 June, but it is expected that the work will be finished by

20 July.
LILYRIC

10, LILYRIC's performance continues to be prolific -~

should be pointed out that this blanket coverage is useful
insurance that all activity is caught, Combined wath the
daily fixed surveillance reports on all members of the FJSTEAL

_dnstallation, the Station can safely Ray that its coverage of

FJSTEAL installation ingress and egress is complete during
working hours (and any extra hours which tho Station wishes
Covered). Since L May LILYRIC has been on duty S7 hours per
Sook: 0800-1800 weekdays and OS00-1500 Saturdays. Commensurate
wich their now schedule (and the return of LIEMPTY-26 to the
Retive roster), the total monthly LILYRIC salary has cone {rom
4,900 pesos per month to 6,000 pesos per month (LIEWTYs 13,

14, 26, and 27, aro of course, father, mothor, and two sons),
Tho fixed survoillance reports are used on a daily basis, since
the Station constantly has operational interest in keowing
whether a particular FJSTEALER was "in" or "out" at a particular
tine, and if ous, who he went with, what time he left, ete.

In addition, LILYRIC has standing instructions to notily
GERENDE (and GERENDE the Station) immodiatoly when American~
appearing visitors come to the FJSTEAL installation, Kight such
visits were noted in the reporting period, along with a nuxber
of other visitors who, for one reason or another, attracted the

special attention of LILYRIC.

LIMITED

11, LIBYPTY-6 slowed down noticoably in the reportins period,
He was ill several times, his surveillance reports were occaq
Sionally inaccurate, and his photosraphic work was poor. With
the assurance that LILYRIC would be able to take up the slack
(and give us better coverage for less money) the decision was
nade to terminate the LIMITED base house. While wo are thereby
Boniod sone of the flexibility which we bave had in the past,
St ia likely that LIEMPTY-6 would slowly have faded out of the
picture anyway. While he was in there, he produced 911 opera~
tional photos, as well as daily fixed surveillance reports.
following his tormination (a report ox which is beins forwarded
separately) LIENPTY-G took a trip to Europe and has now started
forking full-time in tho insurance business for his sou-in-law,
Where he has gained a new lease on life. In other words, the
termination couldn't have been nore amicable,  LIENPTY-8 vacated
the LIMITED apartment (he said he could not afford to: keep
paying the rent) and it is no longer availablo to the Station.

Vincent P, St34UT0, The major reason for the change in case
siticers “was to bring the LIEMPTY project into the section which

three-monts geriod covered by this progress report, GERENDS was
met by the case officer 32 times, Ncetings were normally preo
arranged, with times and sites varied (vith the introduction of
the new case officer, most of the corner regular meeting sites

be a reliable and perceptive reporter of the events he observes.
For this reason, he has been asked to provide special coverage on
various individuals of interest, or on particular days when cover~
age is desired, The Station has found the LICALLA reports to be
consisteutly useful in determining the presence, activities, and

to the location of the LICALLA base house, but it is also due to

5, The LILYRIC b: of vouse has been a prolific provider of
operational photos, 4,04 having been submitted in the period
under review, While there 25 occasionally superfluous coverage
of visiting sports and cultural delegations (and LILYRIC personnel
have been: instructed to be more selective in this respect) the
blanket coverage afforded by this base house guarantees that
nothing will be missed during normal working hours, ‘the tixed
surveillance reports are voluminovg, highly accurate, and quite
valuable, On three separate occasions during the reporting
period LILYRIC alerted the Station to the presence of Anerican
visitors at the target installation,

TED

6, The efficiency of the LIMITED base house has suffered

a slow decline, LIEMPTY-6 has been out of action for short
~ periods because of illness and a physical examiuation, The
Bhysical, however, showed that he 1u in good health and we look
for an improvement in his performance in the next reporting period.
His surveillance reports are not entirely reliable due to a .

Mireet contact with LIEWGRACE-1, leader of the LIEMBRACE surveil~

moved to LIERT 4's office because cf renevations going on in
GERENDE'S house. LIEMPTY-4 processes the photos af ter working

a possible access agent to LIRING, This eventually culminated
in an attempted recruitment of the prospect .by GERENDS. Although
the attempt was uos' cessful, GERENDE exhibited corsiderable
resourcefulness and operational skill in developing the target

to a point where the recruitment attempt was possible. We plan
to use GERENDE in similar roles in the future as opportunities
arise, and for this reason we plan to document him with a set

of faise Mexicun documentation as well as a set of false Anerican
Gocumentation, GERSNDE is collecting exemplars and getting the
background information needod, and once the necessary data are
aasembled, Headquarters (WOACRE) support will be requested.

10. GSRENDE has continued to provide support for the JMROD
operation as needed,

11,’ In September and-October 1967 GERENDE was employed by
the Mexican MHRAVEL committee. He was able to get assigned as
aide to the DIZTAG delegation. In this capacity he was able to
supplement very nicely the information and support being provided
by Jeremy S. HODAPP, This foot-in-the-door came in very handy,
and is expected to be even more valuable in 1968, if GERENDS can
get the position again, While the job was rather time-consuming
we believe that it was well worth it,

412, In connection with his duties with MHRAVEL, as well as
in connection with the fact that his WOFIRM activities are nearly
100% against the FJSTEAL target, GERENDE was given a very geveral
briefing on the Station's REDTOP program, It is our hope that,
in having a better idea of what the Station is trying to do in
this field, GERENDE will be able to make an even greater contri-

bution to that program than he has in the past.

4, There wore no known security incidents during the periai covered in this
report. As a precautionary measure, the LIEMPTY baschousekeepers were instructed
to caintain incronsod vigilance in their respective areas ani.tcildings and'to be
prepared to evacuate any incriminating equipaent ani papers on a moment's notice,
This was done because of the renewed interest in the assassiraticn of President
Kennedy which in turn brought forth comefits in the press stout photographs
taken of Osvald during his visit to Mexico. On three occasicns during this period,
LIEMBRACE-3 curveilled the operational meetings between GSRENTS and LIEMPTY-6,
‘Taio was done inorder to try to ascertain if any FUSTEAL persomel vere taking

of the meetings he covered appeared to be clean of hostile surveillance.

to surveill GERENDE when he departed the meeting site and to report to GERENDE
after LIEMGRACE-3 vas convinced that there vas no hostile surveillance end after

they had departed the meeting area.)

LICALLA

5. Daring this period LIEMPTY-9, operator of the LICALLA basehouse, provided .
1112 frames of operational photographs covering the patio an? sarden area of
FJUTEAL, ALL photographs provided by LIEMPTY-9 were accompanied by fixed=
surveillance reports, sighting reports and special notes, LISMTY-9 ie a per
ceptive individual and his special notes ani coments are considered to be of
great value by the interested section in the Station, LICALIA coverage vas
suspended during the period 19:through 25 March while LIEMPTY-9 vas taking a well-
deserved vacation, The cover of ‘the LICALLA basehouse appears to remain good,
with no undue attention devoted to it by FUSTEAL personnel.

LILYRIC

6, This basehouse, which is staffed by LIEMPTY-13, -14 ani -27, produced
2553 frames of operational photographs during the review period, LIEMPTY-13 is
employed full-time and most of the coverage is provided by LIENPTY-14, and -27,
although during this period, LIEMPTY-14 carried the largest stare of the vorkload,
In March the hours in vhich LIEMPTY-27, a medical student, attenied school
vere changed from the afternoon to the morning, This schedule change will remain
in effect until the end of June 1967, LIEMPTY-14'does not have the mental composure
to remain on the Job for the hours needed to provide full-tize coverage and her
houekeeping duties often interfered with her working hours, In order to alleviate
this problem, the working hours of LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED were increased and those of
LILYRIC/LIMPTY-14 decreased. No serious loss of coverage resulted from this tem-
-porary change in working hours. The salary of LIEMPTY-27 was cut in half for the
period of time in which he will not be providing contimal assistance to the Project,

7. LILYRIC remains as the main source of information on WCLADY and other
foreign visitors to FJSTEAL,

LIMITED

8, LIFMPTY-6, the operator of the LIMITED basehouse, provided 684 frames of
operational photographs during the three month period, LISETY-< also spent a
great deal of tine alerting for the LIEMSRACE survetllance tesa during this period
because of the AINUALTTY-1 operation, LIEMPTY-6 vas on vacation trom 3 through
23 April and coverage from this basehouse vas suspended during this period. As
mentioned above, LIEMPTY-6 now is working longer hours in orier to relieve LIEMPTY-1!
LIEMPTY-6 does not know why his hours vere increased.

9. On one cccaston during this pertot LIRPTY-6, while alerting the LIFMERACE

1. In Decenter 1966 Raymond H. GERENDE, Principal Agent for tbe LIEMPTY

the security of the LILYRIC, LIMITED and LICALLA Basehouses vis-a-vis Soviet

edited version of GERENDE's roport, which was recelved on 28 Docesbur 1966,
Station comments follow GERENDE’s and are so noted.

2. In ita present new location LILYRIC is the newest of the photo bases
under my control, According to LIEMPTY-15, there has been no indication of
interest of any sort by the Eoviets in the family's move to the nev apartment
nor was there in the past any show of intorest or peculiar behavior on their
(Soviet's) part with regard to the old base and tho possibility that they aight |

be under photo surveillance.

3. The cover for the work carried on by thio base is good since the
wife, LIEMPTY-14, vho does most of the work has no trouble in justifying
her presence at howe all of the time, The son, LIEMPTY-27 is a medical
student and attends his classes regularly and can justify his hours as
study hours. (He continues to be an excellent student and wat exeapted fron
/~ examinations at the end of this, his second year in medical schocl. Actually,
he studies most of the night). LIEMPTY-13 requires no cover as he has a
full-time job as croduction manager for a large concern and he usually makes
his meetings with GERNDE on his vay to or from work.

the Soviets vould have revualed the tell-tale position of the venetian blinds
in doth the old and the new bases. I have no doubt that the Soviets realize
they are under photo surveillance, The move by the fanily from the old to the
new building aust surely have been noted by the Soviets. Possibly the Soviets
think the family is working with the local authorities due to LIEMPIY-13's
former association vith the Mexican Army.

6. Station Comments. The Station agrees with GERENDS that careful
observation by tho Soviets vould have revealed the missing slat in the venetian
blinds and also the fact that those blinis are seldom open. The Station also
asrees that the Soviets realize that they are under photo survetllance.

is was pointed out recontly when a Soviet shielded an LNEKGO valk-in when
they passed the front gate of the Mnbassy and made a sign to the walk-in
indicating that they could be seen ty someone watching with a telescope
troa the buildings across the street. Also, as Heedquarters is avare, there
have been numerous comments by residents of Mexico City to the effect that
anyone entering the Soviet Unbassy is photographed; however, seldom has it
been rumored that the “Americans” are doing it, which might indicate acst people
belteve the Mexican Governcent is doing any such photographing and thereby
reaffirming GERENDE's statement that the Soviets possibly believe the Mexican

Government runs the base.

7. Given the assumption that the LILYRIC base is blown, the Station at
this point does not plan to terminate or revamp the LILYRIC installation,
Any operational change by the operators would be spotted by the Soviets and
if the Base were closed the Soviets would start looking for a new installation,
‘The LILYRIC Base is performing a useful function and it is believed that it
Will continue to do so. The Soviets nave had opportunities to complain to
the Mexican Government about boing monitored photographically and have not
seen fit to do so and it is believed that they probably vill not do so unless
there is a radical change in soviet and/or Mexican policy. The Station has
instructed GEHNDE to take every precaution during his meetings with LIFMPTY-13
to assure that LIEMPTY-13 does not lead the Soviots to him and thereby
Jeopaniizing other operations, especially LICALLA.

8, The operator of the LIMITED Base, LIEMPTY-<,is, to my knowledge,
the oldest hand in the photo surveillance of the Soviet target and possibly
the acst likely to be "burned", iis residence for years at the former Base
(now the site of the new LILYRIC building) end his move to the present base
could not have gone unnoticed by the Soviets. His cover is that of an
insurance salesman, but he actually does not work at the cover and is ut
a disadvantage in trying to explain his source of income, At times, in years
past, he had to afford full-time coverage from the base, vhich alloved him
to engage in credible cover activities.

9. QERENDE Comments. I do not believe that LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED is a
security risk; however, his present means of working from an open door leading
to his balcony probably can be spotted by the Soviets, LIENPTY-6 is extremely
cautious about checking himself for surveillance when making meetings.

base. In regard to LIMITED, LICOWL-1 has reported that tho Soviets are very”
interested in LIEMPTY-6/LDIITED ond that co many Sovioto havy talked to him
(LICOML-1) about LIEMPTY-6 that he {e convinced that the Soviets have & "rear"

12. The cover for this base is that of a normal residence. LIEMPTY-9's
cover work ic that of a car and insurercs salesman in a local automobile
agency in the afternoon only. LIEMPTY~3 does work in his cover. LIEMPTY-9's
cover for the use of the operating room 1s that he does accounting work for
client firms, The door 1s kept locked at all times and LIEMPTY-9 never allows
the cervant to enter, even for cleaning purposes. The equipment is kept
locked in a trunk within the room vhen not in use and ell loge and photos
are kept in a safe located in LIEMTY-9's bedroon closet.

13. GERENDE Comment. I believe the Soviets aro avare of the Photo
surveillance being carried out by this baee due to the pouition of the window
and the curtains during the hours when LIEPTY-9 is operating.

1h, Station Comment. The Station does not believe that this photo base
48 known to the Soviets, Thic belief {o based on the fact that the LICALLA
coverage is excellent and there has been no indication that the Soviets act
for tho benefit of observers vhile they are in the backyard, It is interesting
to note that the Soviets made no effort to "protect" the LNERGO walk-in mentioned
in paragraph 6 above during a vieit to the backyard and LICALLA did obtain
photographs of the valk-in, The school children ro longer pase through the
backyard because the location of tia school was recently chanzed and the children
now go by another route. The Station has Instructed GHINDE to take every pre-
caution in order to protect the security of the LICALLA base.

15. As a general comment pertaining to the security of the bases in-
volved in Project LIEMPTY, it should be noted that tho Soviets are avare of
the fact that LIMOUSINE is the owner/builder of the now LILYRIC building.
LIMOUSINE is also the owner of the LIMESA complex, through a holding company.

fieations: of new LIMERICK staffers and also visitors to the LINSRICK install:
tion; providing leads to tha relative rank and the specific intelligence
service affiliation of various LIMSRICK officers; keeping tha Station abreast
of construction and physical changes in the LIMERICK physical plant; and

~~ providing a reliable check on various Station and LNERGO access agents,

As noted in paragraph 5 of reference A, Station is in the process of
increasing the houra of both the photographie and physical gurveillance :
coverage provided by the LILYRIC operations during the veek-days, At

present, the LILYRIC personnel are providing coverage from early uorning

the LILYRICs have woved into the new LIMCUSINE building, it ts anticipated

that they will be able to provide complete dawn to dusk coverage, the

physical surveillance reports usei in Mexico City Station's operations :
targetted against the LIMERICK installation ahd personnel. Tzis activity

is in direct support of, and in consonance with, the current XC as spproved
for the Station, . The LIEfTY coverage bes proved to be a mst reliahle

tool fort folloving the daily aoveaents of LINGRICK personnels providing
leads to, and confirming the identities of LIMERICK staffers ani their
visitors; verifying te reletive rank ani specific intellisence service
connection of various LIMERICK officers keeping the Station abseest of
construction changes cf the LIGRICK physical plant; and verizyins reports
of Station access agents. During the pertod under review, the LISETY
pasehouses produced 4,212 photosraphs (149 rolls) as well as &0 pases of
fixed surveillance reports covering this target.

b) LIENIRAP =. Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP mebileantt was
targetted asainst leaders and meeting-sites of the local comucis? parties
as well os other targets of opportunity, Specifically, LISS provided
up-to-date photosraphs of numerous conmunist officials, which sre of value
to both the JMPIGER proaram and Station's penetration/recruitzent
program, The LIENTRAP unit and personnel also remtlerly serviced 2 postal
accomnodation addresses used by Nexico Cily Station, lNeadquatters, ani other
field Stations, ‘The MIENERAP unit provided a total of hk cperaticral

photogrephs.

¢) LIMITED - During the reporting period, the LIMITED basehouse
provided 1,412 frames (54 rolls) of cperational film and daily otservation
reports covering the arrival ant departure of LIMERICK persornel snd
visitors at the tront gate of the installation during the afternoon and early
evening hours, In addition, LIGPTY-G, the LIMIPSD basehouse Xeeper, served
as the radio dispatcher on several LISMERACH surveillance operations, The
value and need of the LIMIVED fixed-raiio dispatching base has Seen explained
in detail in previous LIEMPTY Frocress Reports.

a) LILYRIC - During this period, the LILYRIC hasehouse protzeed 1,542
frames (5% rolls) of operational photosraphs, covering the saze erea and
tergeta noted in the LIMITED section, but during the morning ani early
afternoon hours. In addition, LILYRIC prepared a weekly repert on the
comings and goings of each LIMERICX sta‘fer and contributed the aajority of
this project's physical surveillance reports,

@) LICALLA - Throughout this period, the LICALLA baseho:
photographic coverage of the saniea and patio area of the LIVE
stallation, an erea where many of the officers, their families, avi visitors

Other than the attezpted PERUMEN surveiilence of the AMROD accommodation
address noted above (which was neutralized by GERENDS's alertness), there
have been no known ineldents which adversely affected the security of the
LIEMPTY project or the related agent perncnnel. ‘hile several minor ad-
ministrative problems arose, all such matters were resolved locally.

5. CHANOES ‘AND PLANNTNO

a) One major operational change is planned for the ensuing period,
Upon completion of the new LIMOUSINE structure (see HMMA-25352, dated 20
February 1965), the Station will move the present LILYRIC basehouse
personnel (LIFMPTYs 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edifice rather than the
LIMITED (LIg@TYs 6 and 7) personnel as originally planned, Ancillary
modifications are: 1) To increase the hours of both the photographic and
physical surveillance coverage provided by the LILYRIC operators (dawn to
dusk) during the week days and 2) have LIMITED provide photographic and
physical surveillance coverege on week-ends only, while remnining on datly
stand-by for radio-dispatching assignments, Ties changes were dictated by
the following considerations:

1) The new LIMOUSINE building will offer a much better vantage point
for both photosraphic and physical surveillance than does the present
complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases, Therefore, the
Station feels that the personnel occupying this new base should be

those possessing the highest technicel akills and also tose able to
provide the most thorough ani complete coverage, Since the [IMITED base
now has only one traine? operator while the LILYRIC basehouss has three,
the LILYRIC group is indicated.

2) Beceuse it appears that the coverage of the LI“FRICK installation
will be a long-range end continuing requirenent, the Station desires
to staff the new hase with personnel of lon3-renge potential. Since
LIEMTY-6 is now almost 60 years old, it is obvious thet he does not
possess this potential; however, the TILYRIC agent complex happily
combines experienced personnel vith youthful agents,

3) Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC personnel is
much more compatible and consistent with the environment of the new
building than is that of the LIMITED family,

While it is anticipated that these modifications and changes will initially
cause varicus administrative and operational probleas, it is believed that
all, such adjustaents can te handled locally.

ATTENTION:
SUBJECT: LIEMPTY, LIMOUSINE
REFERENCE: Mexi 2159

1, In coaveraation with the Headguartere officer concerned
with LIEMPTY LIMOUSINE affaire, thie Cifice wae apprised of the
fact thst the proposed transaction, outlined ia vefcerace cable, would
be executed without recourge to advice on the legal aspects of the
sale under Mexican law and with no intentisa to make LIMOUSINE's
commitment to this Agency legally bindiag. It le further intended
that LIMOUSINE's "promiocory notes" be sasecured,

2, Should the proposed transaction Be carried out ta this
manner, this Agency would be unable to caforce LIMOUSINE's
promise to pay hla debt, and would have zo legally cogaivable inotrus
ment te present to an executor of his estate should he dic before
meeting his obligations to us, In addition, eur right to continued
possession of the apartment would be teaucus at be ot,

3. Thue it ia planned to convoy real catate appraised at
$14,448 in exchange for $7, 200 and a callectiva uf unenforceable,
unsecured promises, itis hard to believe that in this case, operas
tional security precludes closer protection of Agency assets.

Chief, WIT Division

- LIEMPTY Project Renewal Comments

RRR AE are

~ None, for Headquarters information onl)

HMMW-8515, 25 February 1960

1." "Tt would appear from paragraphs 2a and 2b of reference jhat
KUDESK and KUTUBE Ops have not been completely infortiéd-of the back-
ground of the LIEMPTY Project and its agent-requirements, At the time
HMMA -14093 (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, it
was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any addittonal
questions, based on reports and dispatches not normally available to the
senior staffs, which might be raised during the renewal process,

2, In answer to paragraph 2a, Oliver G, SCANTLING first contacted
Inez PARADA de Moreno in early. 1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement,
He visiced her ag an are*rect interested in viewing the LIMERICK installation
from the building where she lives, He was socially acquainted with her brother,
a Catholic Priest, and knew the family to be unquestionably anti-Communist,
However, it would be imprudent on the Station's and SCANTLING's part to
assume that PARADA does not at least suspect that some anti- LIMERICK
intelligence service Is. involved. PARADA suggested during SCANTLING's
initial visit that he couid return at any time for further observations, This
was reported by SCANTLING on 2I March 1957 and it does not seem appropriate
to query him again on the pretext for his recent visits,

3. While HMMA-~14093 correctly referred to LLMITED, LILYRIC and
LICALLA as "photographic basehouses, " the Station would like to emphasize
that photographic coverage is oaly one of their functions (please see HMMA-12095,
4 February 1959). LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for atomobile
surveillance teams in addition io pi surveillance of persons entering
att the front gate. Their photograph negligible compared to their other duties,
The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front
gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the pictures is from the
second floor and above the street tratfic which partially blocks LIMITED
photographs, LILYRIC also docs vidual reports on LIMERICK personnel
entering and leaving the main gate, . LICALLA is used almost exclusively to
identify LIMERICK officials and to support KUTUBE/D requirements in
connection with the LIMESA/LIMUST Project, As an indication of the effect-

iveness of LICALLA photographic coverage, the Mexico Station has all the
a L

LIMERICK officials identified, Before this base was activated more than two-
thirds of the LIMERICK officials were unidentified. In order to support other
operations, it is considered essential that the Station identify all LIMERICK
officials. In this respect, LICALLA nas provided most of the necessary infor-
mation. The retention of this base is also considered vital to.the security of
the LIMUST portion of the LIMESA Project,

4. The Station does not agree that the color photography and moving
pictures are a luxury. Color slides were made for identification purposes
and have proved useful, particularly in identifying facial features and skin
coloring, The motion pictures were made at Headquarters suggestion (Please
see HMMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and HMMW-8438, 26 January 1960),

CONTINUATION OF

DISPATCH _| + SECRET/+@IK

5, <In conclusion, the Station would like to point out that the "photo-
graphic basehouses” represent an integral and significant part of the Station's
counteresptonage effort against the LIMERICK installation, ‘These bases do
not produce Foreign Intelligence and should not be considered In such a light.

: : eo wis oY
1. On 13 October 1959 it was learned{com source that the local ODENVY
chief got a priority cable from his Headquarters asking why data concerning the
Mexican apprehension of the (KUBARK) truck and photographer had not been re~
ported to the U. S, Ambassador locally, The statement was made that “such
matters as thig should be immediately reported to the Ambassador."

2. This cable resulted from the report the ODENVY office sent in on
the incident from the knowledge they had - as reported in reference,

3, The local ODENVY chief replied to his Headquarters that he did not
agree that mattere concerning KUDARK operations should be reported by ODENVY)

to the Ambassador.

4. Source stated that the cable wae obviously a result of the KUBARK/
ODENVY headquarters "ill feeling" which presently exiats and ‘hich source
believes is primarily (and principally) attributable to the article in TRUE magasiny

of September 1959,

5, Source is LIMEW.

6. It is requested that under no circumstances should the information
contained herein be disseminated in any form: whatsoever outside KUBARK.

2, LIEMPTY-10 was instructed on 17 September to case the area surrounding
the Theatre Iris, located at Donceles 36, preliminary to undertaking a photographic
surveillance of all persons entering and leaving’the theatre between the hours cf
0930 and 1200 hra., 20 September. In this instance, the Station's target was a pro~
Cuban rally sponsored by the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos (CEM). ‘The Station
had received information that many of the leading Mexican and Central American
Communists would attend this rally and that this was an oppertune time to establish
which ones did attend and to collect their photographs, ‘The Station did not know that
the Mexican Scerct Suzvice would also be covering thia meeting for the purpose of
preventing a Communtet-inspired demonsteation,

3, The Station was advised at 1730 hrs,, 20 September. by Raymond H.
GERENDE (ps), the Principal Ayent who handles LIEMPTY-10, that L-10 was being
held by the Seeret Service, Immediately following this notfeation, Allen W, WARE
(ps) waa requested to contact Philip K, TESSAROLO (pa) and request him to implemept ”
procedures throwgh a criminal lawyer to effect the release of L-10. TESSAROLO
waa contacted aud briefed at 2200 hours and immediately began atternpts to locate
a reliable criminal lawyer, Lowever, as somctimes happens in an emergency
situation, his two most appropriate contacts were out of tewn, It wag not until the
following morning at 0700 ara, that TESSAROLO located another reliable lawyer
who agreed to handle the case.

4, Since GERENDZ was known to L-10 and since the Station could not be
gure-how much L-10 mizht be forced to tell the Secret Services GERENDE was

given the following instructions:

A. To disconnect immediately the LIFEAT/LIVERY lincs in the base
where he and his wife ‘were living and to move all equipment to another safe
location, It was belicved appropriate to take this precaution even though L-10
dad not know the location of the LIVERY base, the telephone number of the
base, or even that GERENDS was living at a place other than his mother's
residence in another part of the city.

BR. To collect and deposit with his Case Officer any compromising papers
presently in hie possession.

C, To make a ee nspection of the outside photographic lab at his

mother's house.

D. Yo phons L-10's wife and inform her that procedures were underway
to ubtain L-10's release and ior her not to become upset and talkative,

5, During the evening of 20 September the Station LIFEAT Cane Officer
was advised that GERENDE had been uirected to disconnect the LIVERY lines
and to transier all LIFEAT equipment to a safe location, Te further insure the
security of LIVERY, all LIVERY lincs were pulled externally during the early
morning of 21 September, .

&. At approximately 1000 hrs,, 21 September, LIMEW informed the Chief
of Station that a contact of his (LIMEW's) had just informed him that L-10 (true
namie) ans the LIENTRAP vehicle were being held’by the Secret Service, LIMEW
stated that if L-10 was one of KUBARK's agents he would attempt to have hia
contact in the Secret Service obtain his immediate release, LIMEW was told
that L-10 was, in fact, a KUBARK ayent and that the Station would very much
appreciate his efforts to effect his release, A short while later LIMEW again
contacted the Chief of Station and informed him that it would be necessary for
documented ODACID official personally to contact a Commandante fnu LIMON”
of the Seeret Service and that L-10 would then be released, According to LIMEW,
L-10 hag teld the Secret Service-that he was carrying oyt his operational photo-
graphic assignment on a contract basis for ODACID; therefore, an ODACID
official would have to establish L-10's bona fides,

7 As the Station learned later, the Seeret Service agents were roughing up
some of viduals attending the rally; consequently, they were endeavoring
that no photographs were talcen which could be used apainst them by
sists, L-10 and L-11, the LIENTRAP driver who left the acene before }
4, were just preparing to leave the area after taxing five rolle of film
when a Se wut demanded a search of the vehicle on tho: suspicion that
it contazned Communist propaganda, L-10, his camera with telephoto lens and
the Gim were then discovered in the rear of LIENTRAP, It wag at this time that
L-10 was accused orally by the police officers of being a Soviet agent and later of
being a loeal Communist agent, After being taken to Secret Service Headquarters,
L-10 tolj LIMON, in private, about his association with ODACID and emphasized
that he certainly was not a Communist agent, LIMEW's source (possibly Com=
mandante LIMON), believing that there may be some truth in L-10's statement,
contacted LIMEW. Based in part on assumption and in part on fact, this is the
Station's opidion as to how ODENVY became involved in the case,

8. The Station, realising that LUEMPTY-10 had not committed an illegal
act by ¢ photographs, decided that WARE should personilly visit LIMON
and request L-10's release, WARE contacted LIMON and the sub-jcfe of the
Secret Service, Raul MENDIOLEA Cerecero, about 1230 hrs., 2} September,
ident:fied Aimself ag an ODACID official and told them that L-10 did from time
to time perform photographic assignments for ODACID, particularly in the
field of local Communist activities, WARE also told LIMON and MENDICLEA
that L-19 was never permitted to do any task which was illegal under Mexican
at if he had done so it was certainly not under the auspices of ODACID,
own volition, They implied that L-10 had not done anything illegal and
y Wanted to be sure about was that L-10 was not a Communist agent, L-
diately released and the LIENTRAP vehicle returned to him with
tact, including the five rolls of undeveloped film,

that all
10 was in
equipme

9. ‘While WARE was on his way to sec LIMON at the Secret Service Head-
quarters, tac Chief of Station was advised by the ODACID Security Office that
L-10 was’ deing detamed oy the Secret Serv ee curity Office was told that
WARE was presently investi: iy the matter and should be at the Secret Service
Headquarters at that time. By coincidence, WARE was talking to MENDIOLEA
when ODACID Security 0: e phoned to inform him that WARE wag taking care
of the matter, [t was learned later that MENDIOLEA is a brother-in-law of the
local inve st.gator employed full time b, the ODACID Security Office. This was how|
ODACID becanie involved in the incident. To the best of the Station's knowledge, th
ODACID Security Officer has said nothing more about the incident and, at the time,
did not attach any particular significance to it or seem especially concerned about

L=10' statement that he did aume photographic work for ODACID, There was no
newspaper or other publicity pertainin, to L-10 ur LIENTRAP.

10, Ourang his visit to Sveret Servi Headquarters WARE discovered that
L-10 had not been booked or formally charged with an Wlecal act and that neither
LIMON nor MENDIOLEA could recall L-10's name, L-10 was not placed in jail |
duriny, the 26 hours he waa at Seerct Service Headquarters but, rather, was permuttdd
to remain in the Secret Service agents' duty roum, No bribes were necessary to
obtain his release; however, per LIMEW's request, $500,00 pesos were given to
LIMEW to give to his source, LIMEW said that in addition to notifying him about
L-10's detention, the source was also reoponsible for all equipment and film being
returned intact to L-10,

li, TESSAROLO was advised, as soon ay LIMZW became involved in the casd,
that the criminal lawyer should not pursue the matter any further. ‘wo bottl
scotch whiskey were given to the lawyer through TiSSAROLO for the few taska he
had already performed,

12, After his release, L-10 reported that he was not interroyated and that he
did not reveal any data about other operations he has worked on nor did he give ‘the
names of anybody connected with operational activities, Based on the developments
in the case, the Station has no reason to doubt the veracity of L-10's statement,: L-
10 was reprimanded for hie use of statements to the Secret Service about being
employed by ODACID. ie was told that the revelation of such employment waa to
be made only by the Station and that henceforth he is never to use such a cover
story, L-10 was also reprimanded for his lack of judgment in remaining in an arca
where there was a strony concentration of police; it is believed safe to asuume that
L-10 will never make thie same mistake ayain.

13, In retrospect, it is interesting to note that L-10's use of the ODACID
employrnent story 18 possibly responsible for hie not being interrogated and thua
compromising other operations and individuals. his case has pointed out to the
Station the desireability of having casual contacts in the Seerct Service and othee
local police-type organizations so that the Station, rather than ODACID ant ODENVY,
in the firat to learn of incidents of this type. Considering the multifarious activities
handled by the Station, it saust be assumed that the police will occasionally appre-
hend an agent and that the Station must be geared to handle such emergencies,

14, The Station is allowing a one inonth'y cooling off period for the LLS
TRAP vehicte and LIEMPTY-10. ‘The vehicle will then be painted another atanderd
color and re-registered in the State of Mexico, After these security precautions
are observed, the Station seea no reason why carcfully selected photographic sur-
vettlance operations should not continue wich L-10 as a wiser and more prudent
LIENTRAP operator,

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS -- OLIVER G, SCANTLING SEGMENT

2, Agent Information ~ Oliver G, SCANTLING has continued to perform his
+ assigned tasks in an outstanding manner, SCANTLING's potsc, common sense,
education, ideology and native abil i ity for the pursuit of clandestine activities

make him one of the most valuable support,assets available to the Mexico City
Station, The fact that SCANTLING has full time overt occupation as Chief
Enginee r and Production Manager for a local manufacturing company adds to

his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent, On two occasions dur ing the past
six months SCANTLING has indicated to his Case Officer that he would like to
resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK ope rational
duties; however, the Case Officer has discouraged him from doing this oa the
basis that he has more long-range potential when his cover occupation is legitimate,
Of course, SCANTLING would be more valuable if he could work full time forthe
Station, but not sufficiently soto warrant his resignation from his overt job (his
monthly salary in his overt job is in excess of $800,00 U, S,), The only
significant limitation that SCANTLING has evidenc ed to his present Ca se Officer
is his occasional dc vlay in prepar ing written reports of tnvestigatio ns and other
“|matters requiring reports for the files, However, this limitation gradually is
being babe ed and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to

be factual, comprehen sive and soon will be promptly submitted, i gney

using such perishable leads, SCANTLING frequently is directed to make approaches

is a calculated risk “which both SGANTLING and the Station must take if penetration
f the primary target is achieved, whether technically or by a recruitment in place,
It is to, SCANTLING's credit that he has not yet become involved in an incident which
he Station feels has compromised him and/or alerted the target of KUBA RK's many
rational ef forts against them, The closest SCANTLING has come to being compro-
Hised and to being identi fied as a P3PRIME agent stems direetly from the LIPSTICK
survelll ance team flap of June 1958, The office used by the surveillance team was
ented by SCANTLING in his true name at the time that he was Icader ofthe team,
Yor the slightest indication, however, has becn uncovered which points to SCANTLIN

accurate drawing of the ty pe door installed at LIMERICK, This drawing was
forwardad to Headquarters via HMMA -11926, 21 January 1959,

E, Casing Report on West German Embassy - During June, July and
August 1958, SCANTLING prepared a detailed casing report on the new
West Ger man-Embas sy, SCANTLING's engineering ability enables him to
pre pare accurate drawings and sketches from a minimum of data, Also,
his personality and gregarious manner permit him to visit the inside of such
establishments, with an appropriate cover story, and retain minute details
which later he commits to paper and emerges with a comprehen sive floor
plan and important construction data,

F, “LIMERICK Construction - SCANTLING's Long asso ciation with this
target from the casing standpoint provides the Stat ion with an unparalleled
sou rce of in formation about LIMERICK construc tion activ ities, modifications
and reasons for same, All of the LIMERICK cas ing reports on file in Head -
qua rters are the product of SCANTLING's unusual a bility and knowledge,
Consultat ions with Station Officers about LIME RICK construction have been
of benefit to the Stat iondiring this reporting period an. they wili continue to
be of worthwhile importance,

G. Routine Investigations and Surve illances - Although the Station has
several assets capable of performing investigations and surv eil lences,
SCANTLING is still used in situations requiring the utmost in discretion and
clande stinity, His activities in this connection are too numerous to list
here; suffice it to state that he has contributed materially to the Station's
collection of operational in fermation through his investigative effo rts,
SCANTLING's interview of Paul Frederick Ktr schho ff (201-4 3645) of LCMAY-
FOWL interest is an example of SCANTLING's use on-investigations (see
HM MA-11749, 17 December 1958),

H, ESGEM-15 - SCANTLING served as the cutout with ESGEM~1 5 during
the latter's December 1958 trip to Mexico City, In this connection
SCANTLING is a suppori asset which is trustworthy and depenaable,
SCANTLING never displays undue curiosity in operations such as the ESGEM-15
one; he accepts the minimum amount of informaticn given and performs his
duties in a professional and sincere manner,

I, LIEMPTY/3 - SCANTLING handles the administ rative mart ers connected
with L/3, Doris M, KILLGO provides oper ational direction to L/3, During
this reporting period, the Stat ion had hopes of SCANTLING taking over the
ope rational super visioa of L/3's.activities, However, after a four-month
trial period with both SCANTLING and KILLGO meeting with L/3, it was
decided tha it would be desirable for KIIIGO to continue handling L/3. L/3's
unusual personality and intellect indicated that he could best be directed by
a PBPRIME citizen, Therefore, SCANTLING no longer attends KUI_LGO's
and L/3's operational meetings, although he does continue to handle L/3's
administrative problems,

“Mexico City: in Dece mber 1958 and January 1959, it was con sidered app ropriate
for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP, Although this
procedure deféats some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner

in which the Station could maintain efficiency with the three operations listed
above, SCANTLING has known the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA
and LIENTRAP for several years, In fact, he was at one time the agent in

cha rge of these three oper ations,

5. Operational Methods Evolved During the Period - The VIDALES operation
(see paragraph + (© above) indicated to tire Station the necessity for thorough
brief ings and discussions with the agent making an approach toa target, This can
hardly be described as a new operational method, but it does serve to iNustrate
the minimum efforts that should be followed, The forthcoming LINIMENT IV
operation whe rein SCANTLING must recruit the landlord of the ta rget's build ing

is of fering SCANTLING and the Station the opportunity to prepare thoroughly for
SCANTLING's reer uit ment pitch, The excelent documentation prepared by
KURIOT and the story being created by SCANTLING and the Station should increase
the batt ing average on SCANTLING's cold approaches, (See HMMA -11365, 22
October 1958, and HMMW-7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on

this Subject).

In a general sense, one other conclusion can be made about any Station's
support apparatus - where technical and photographic opera tions are poss ibie,
the utility of the information obtained is enhanc cd consider ably by accurate,
comprehen sive and timely casing reporis, SCANTLING, as previously mentioned,
is an excellent asset for this type of support,

6, Administration = SCANTLING's contract explres on 15 February 1959,
As of that date SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3, 600, 00 U.S,
for two years, The Station plans to raise his annual compensation to $4,000.00
U.S, No other significant administrative problems exist,

ior Future Development - Station plans call for the continued
'TLING in the same manner as he is presently being used,

The Station will keep SCANTLING as an independent asset and, it is hoped, resist

the temptation to make him a principal agent in charge of numerous sub-agents, It

is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asset that can be wo rtiwh ile

to the Station for many years to come and that every effors should be made to protect

his security and value to KUBA RK,

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - RAYMOND H, GERENDE SEGMENT

8, Agent Intormation - Aside from the agent information given in HMMA- 11368
22 October 1955, the only significant development was GERENDE's Dec ember 1958
marriage to a U, S, educated girl of Dutch citizenship, The $ 500,00 U, S, for the
purchase of two plane tickets as a wedd ing gift to GERENDE was designed to
impress GERENDE with the fact that KUBARK thinks highly of him as an individual
and chat KUBARK has a great interest in his intelligence career, GERENDE is at
the age and stage in life whe re he is beginning to wonder just what the future holds
for him, In the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERENDE

9,, Security Developments = Again, the information on this subject was covered
adequately ti F MMACIIGS- CERENDE was relieved of his LIFEAT/BGMORNING
jand LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles duties on 10 Dece mber 1958, This, of course, was

in line with recommendations contained in HMMA~11368 and represents a definite
security improvement, GERENDE was told that LIFEAT/BGMORNING was being
terminated because it had not been productive of cnough significant information and
that LIFEAT/Cuban Exiles was being terminated because the occupants of the target
apartment had moved (Note: This was true where the Cubans are concerned.)
dditional sccur ity improvements will be made when Simon D, CLACKETT returns
to Mexico and relieves GERENDE of respons ibility for the LUERSEY sur veilla nce

team,

10, Operational Success and Effectiveness - Briefly reviewed below are the
separate oper atlonal activities which CERENDE managed during the period covered
-jby this report:

A, LIMITED - This base functioned smoothly, securely and efficiently
dur ing the period July through December 1958, ‘The base operator, LIEMPT Y/
demonstrated his usual competence and devotion to duty, in addition to the
primary objective of taking photograph s of individuals of interest, L/6 also
prepared detailed daily logs on the arrivals and departures of all target
personnel, weckly reports of workers activities at the LIME RICK instal lat ion,
per formed three one ~man surve illanc es of Mexicans working at LIMERICK in
an effort to identify them by name and home address, and provided SCANTLING
with information on LIMERICK construction, During this six-month period,
LIEMPTY/6 took approx imately 800 photographs from the LIMITED base,

B, LILYRIC - This base is operated by LIEMPTYs /13 and 14, with LIEMPT ¥/
12 serving as a cutout between the base and GERENDE, LIE MPTY/14 docs most
of the photogra phy and reporting for the base since LIEMPTY/13 has a regular
job and is not on the premises during-regular daytime working hours, L/14
dev otes approximately six hours (0800-1 400) each day to photography and the
remaining time is spent preparing reports, The Base personnel compile
individual Jo gs on cach target personality indicating their arrivals and depa rtures
from the LIME RICK installation (Note: These reports are filed in the
app ropriate Station 201 file and are available to Station officers in analyzing a
target personality 's pattern of daily activity), LILYRIC also prepared a
weekly report on workers activities at the Club and reports the license plate
numbe rs ‘of all vehicles dischar ging or picking up individuals at LIMERICK,
(Note: These license plate numbers are then checked our rnrough LIV PS TOCK/2
for the owne rs names and addresses - in case of im mediate or later operational
interest,) During GERENDE's recent absence from Mexico City, OUSLER met
directly with LIEMPTY/12, Dur ing this period appr oximatel y2,000 photographs
were taken from the LILYRIC base,

C. LICALLA - While LILYRIC and LIMITED are excellent bases for
pio tographing individuals entering and leaving the LIME RICK instal lat ton,
the LICALLA base is the Station's best source of photographs of LIMERICK

employees, LICALLA is so situated that photographs can be made of target
personne! in the garden area of LIME RICK, LIEMPTY/9 is the base operator
for LICALLA and in the Station's opinion performs his job in an outstanding
manner, As reported in IMMA -11368, LIEMPLY/9 is the brother of former
LIPST ICK/47 (the first LIPSTICK surveillance team member arrested in

cs aSrriSTSPSETDESE June 1958), No repe rcussions, or indications of impending ones, have

_resulted in this family relationship, This, certainly, is the major security

problem faced by L/9 during this reporting period, L/9 and his family soon
will have to vacate the LICALLA base for the period of time required to remodel
it, ‘The Station is quite sure that L/9 does not know that his covert employer
owns the LICALLA ‘base and the three adjoining houses and every effort is

being made to preserve this secret from L/9, (See HMMA~12032, 28 January
1959, for a more detailed explanation,) Of course, during the remodeling of
LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA reporting or photographs, In addition
to taking appro ximatcly 2, 500 photographs during tris six-month period, the
LICALLA base also prepared weekly reports on LIMERICK garden activ ities,
These reports indicate which LIMERICK employees are secn together each a
which vehicles different employees are accustomed to using, construction activites
and other matters which appear of significance w L/9,

D. LIENTRAP ~ LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhtic Station as:
Approximately 1,400 clandestine photographs have been made of numerous
targets during this reporting period and LIENTRAP type activities will undoubraily
remain one of the Station's best investigativ¢ asses, As explained in the Field
Pro ject Outline, forwardad to Headquarters on $8 Getober 1958, the Station is
4 of the opinion that the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as possible,

Nearly four months have elapsed without receiving Headquarters authority to
repdace the vehicle, The security situation is even more acute now than at the
time of the request, LIEMPTYs 10 and 11 do an excellent: job on LIENTRAP

ope rations,

E, LIJERSEY - This operation can be characterized as somewhat dormant
for the July - December 1958 period, Because of GERENDE's other important
activities, he did not have the time to train and work w ith the surveillance team,
Also, the Station considered chat it would be stretching secur ity just a bit too f
to have GERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time that he was handling
the photogra phic base houses ard performing monitoring chores for LIFEAT/
BGMORNING and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles, The expected arrival of Simon D,
CLACKEIT in April and his relieving GERENDE of LIJERSEY will enable
the Station to train, within a year, an efficient mobile surveillance team,

At present, LIEMPTYs/15, 16 and 17 compose the LHERSEY team,

F, LIFEAT - Until 10 December 1958 GERENDE served as monitor
in the base house containing LIF EAT/ BG MORNING and LIFEAT/Cuban
Extles, In addition to living in the base house, GERENDE also transcribed
the majority of the SGMORNING and Cuban Exile tapes, He performed
these jobs satisfactofily evea though his efficiency was handicapped by numerous
‘other duties, Relieving GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties enables him to devote
more time to his other operations with a corresponding ierease in the security

of all his activities,

MEMOKANDUM FOR: Coif
SUBJECT + Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico

r
REFEREWE 1s WH/FI Hemorsndum of 14 October 1958

1, The subject of the recruitment of a physical surveillance team in
the United States for use in Mexico as well os other areas within Wil has
long been a topic of discussion at Headquarters, While it is palpably ri~
diculous to consider the use of a surveillance team recruited and trained
4n the United States and based in Mexico, operationally in other areas in
Latin America, there 1s some merit, at least in theory, to the proposal in
2a of reference, Although one of the basic fectors in the make-up of any
surveillance team is that its merbers must be indigenous to the area of op-
eration, it would be possible to recruit such a team as sugcested in 2a and
use this team in Hexico, However, I believe this would be tire-consuming and
very expensive for the following reasons:

a. Machine runs have already been made to spot candidates within
the Agency of the Mexican/American type for tha LIMESA/LIMUST project, with
negative results.

bd. In order to make it attractive to young men of the caliber
desired, we would have to offer some kind of a career with a starting salary
of eomsvhere between the GS 7 and GS 9 level, plus travel and allowances.
Without attempting to even estimate this cost one can see that the figures for
a team of fifteen would run into six digits.

e. It would take a minimum of three months for a recruiter to move
into the southwest aren and spot, contact, develop and recruit a team of
fifteen, 7 etow

d. Oncn a team of suitable candidates was recruited, it would
then teke a minisun of another three months to train these candidates in
basic trade craft and surveillance techniques,

e. Upon completion of the training period, the candidates would
have to ve moved individually into the area of operstion to become familiar
with this area, the language, people, and atmosphere in general, etc, This
would take another three months minimum,

£. After completion of the area familiarization period, the tean
would have to be assenbled and put through various surveillance exercises as
a unit to check them out prior to actual operation.

SEGEFT


a Serer

22+ ~

6 Taere would be other problems confronting such @ team from a
security standpoint, auch ao cover credentiaia, which would always pose &
threat to the operation, ?

2, To-eum up, it would appear that the proposal in 2a of reference:
6 not feasible because of the tine and expense involved plus the always
latent security haeard. ~

3. IT agree with paragraph 2 > of reference. Not only should the
personnel of the surveillance team te recruited at the station, but as out=
lined in paragraph 3 it should be relatively easy to find suitable candidat
For example 4t 4s proposed under the new LIEMPIY project (this consists of
the remainder of the non-blown LIPSTiCEs and the LIJERSEYs) to recruit a
physical surveillance team. Two of the station's outstanding indigenous
agents, Scantling and Gerende, are under this project and both are capable
of spotting, developing, and recruiting agents.

4, I agree with paragraph 3b, ¢, and d, and believe that Headquarters
should zake every effort to find an experienced end competent case officer
to fill Clower's slot as the outside surveillance case officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR: WH
SUBJECT: | Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico

_; le: On 8 October 1958 a meeting of reprenentatives of SR Division
and-CI Staff was held, attended by the undersigned, to discuss means for
building up physical surveillance assets in Moxico, The SR and CI repre-
sentatives pointed out that their current and projected work on BOMORNING
and their cases requires a considerable strengthening of physical surveil<
lance assets, and it was the consensus that these assets would be used
far into the future on Soviet targets, It was further agreed that since
the LIPSTICK operation has encountered difficulties ‘this year, new asseta

should be sought.

2, Various approaches to the problen wera discussed, the most viable
of which were as follows:

a, Rocruiting of teams or basic elements for teams in the Mexican
colonies of tho southwestern U, S,

b, Dispatch of a new case officer to Hexico with the sole and
specific duty of developing and running tho new teams,

¢, A combination of a and b,

3, Initially, it 4s believed the dispatch of a naw case officer to
Mexico would be tho most successful and give the best immediate results,

for the following reasons:

a, Headquarters and Station records contain the names of munerous
cleared contacts or contacts who could be cleared and through whas
introductions could be made iv persons suitable for surveillance works
Hitherto these have not been fully exploited owing to the heavy workload
on Station personnel and the unimpaired functioning till recently of
the LIPSTICK group, Some of these contacts were felt out as recruiters
ard spottors in years past but the matter was never pushed since the
need waa not so great as now,

b. A new case officer is needed bacause the present Station staff
is still too busy to devote the amount of time nesded to build carefully

and train thoroughly the new assets,

¢, The now assets will require the full time direction and
coordination of a case officer who has no other responsibilities, In
this connection, it would be advisable to try to select, train and
utdlize at least twelve new agents as soon as possible.



w2-

d, In brief, a replacenent of the former physical surveillance
leader is Stee but @ more mature and competent case officer is

needed. .

1. Plan a, resruitnant in the Us S., should not bo disstesed from
consideration, It would take longer. than the other plan but might be
‘beneficial in enabling the new agents to be trained in the U, S. ‘They
would then have tu spend tine getting into Mexico and fanilisrize themselves
with operations and operational clinate there, This plan, however, presenta

@ problem as to who is to de the recruiting and training in the U, S.
SR Divieion has offered to be of whatever assistance they can, but there

is no indication they could do any better at this than WID.

Se It may be of interest to you to know that the SR representatives
said the best work done anywhere in the world on the BONGRNIN case, which
has wide international remifications, was dono. by LIKAYAK=2 in Mexicos

REF: a, MEXT 3603 b, DIR 38861 fot

1. On 16 December 1955 the daily check of property which this Station
may desire to use for operational purposea(LICOOL run} showad that a
house adjacent to the LIMRICK target installation was vacant. LIPSTICK-19
was contacted immdiately to investigate the property. He repurted that
it was a one-story house(duplex) in very poor condition wich was being
repaired by the omer for rental. He furtaer reported that from the
maid's room on the roof a clear view of tha entire LIMERICK compound was:
possible and, if he had understood the LIMMRICK language, he would have
been able to understand several conversations which were going on between
LIMEKICK officers in the game area of the compound, LIPSTICK-19 also re«
ported that from the roof of this house it was a distance of only approxi-
mately Nifty fect to the LIMERICK building across fiat roofs with no
obstructing partitions except for a small wall and saveral strands of
barbed wire, ali totalling about four or five feet high between the last
roof and the LIMERICK building.

2, Based upon this favorable report, reference A vas sent imnediately
to Headquarters requesting authorization to rent the house. Two days
later reference B was received granting approval to rent the house. Con-
sequently, LIPSTICK.2.(the only cleared married maa available tc the
Station, with the exception of LIBAITY, woo would fit into the area) was
approached and requested to rent the house, This posed a considerable
problem to LIPSTICK-21, since the house has only two cedrooms and he already
had two children, and at that very time his wife was in the hospital
iving birth to a third child. Further, he had a very confortable house

‘a duplex waich he shared with ais brother-in-law at a pre-devaluation
rent) which he would never be able to again acquire after tais operation
was terminated, He did, however, agree to take the house and it was

apparent to all concerned that ‘iis decision was based upon loyalty to
tiles Station and.dedication to the fight azainst Communism. It is hoped
that this unselfigh snd devoted act of LIPSTICK-21's will be made a

matter of permanent record.

3. ‘The reason for LIPSITCK-2 to move from very comfortable quarters

at less rent into cramped quarters at a higher rental. needed some explana~
tion for nis friends aud relatives. There io a very fino private school
approxiaately one block from this house which LIPSTICK-21 had often men-
tioned as the best in tne city for his children, and consequently he told
everyone that the reason for moving was to be as close as possible to this
school so that his cnildren could attend. It shou)d be noted in this
respect that, in reality, LIPSTICK-21 had bean sending nis chiliren to

one of the best public schools in Mexico City at no cost, Unier the present
circumstances, he will have to pay tuition at the private school because
it 43 the only decent school in the area and it provides excellent cover
for his residence in the area. It is requested that Headquarters authorise
this Station te ansist WIPSTICK-21 in the paymont of his chiliren's tuition
for the above stated reasons. Approximate cost of the tuition wuld be
$20.00 U.S. per child por month, or a total for LIPSTICK-21 of §10,00 US
per month, Authorization is requested to assist LirstICK-21 by payment

of 330,00 U.3. per month.

hs The house is ore of & series of one-story houses that extend from
the LIMEXICK building to a four-story apartment building on the far
corner. The fronts of the houses are all directly on the sidewalk with
the doors opening onto a ono-step stoop, ‘Ire backs of the houses and the
walls of the back patios all abut the compound of the LIMERICK installa-
tion, Tne rear winlows of the house face a patio which ends in a brick
wall. ‘this brick wall 4s not as hin as the roof of the house, ending
about four feet below the level of the roof, There are stairs wich
ascend from this patio to the roof where the maid's quarters are situated,
About halfway up these stairs one can turn and obtain an unrestricted
view of the LIMERICK compound. ilowever, the maid's room offers toe beat
operational possibilities since it provides concealment for the observer
and his equipment, plus a more advantageous view. LIPSTICK-21 told nis
maid that she would have to sleep out at a local pension since he needed
her room for ais radio exveriments, Tais is a plausible story since
LIPSTICK-21 13 known to ve an enthusiastic radio amateur.

5S, The maid's room nas a door that faces across the roofs in the direction
of the LIMMRICK installation and one window waich faces across the house
roof toward the street, A view of the LIMPRICK compound is obtained by

an observer who is back in the room looking through the partly opened door,
Some better method of observation will be worked out wiich will eliminate
the security hazard of a door partially opened at all times of operation,

6, At present we plan to allow LIPSTICK-21 considerable time to get
settled securely into his new quarters before starting any operational
efforts. After this waiting period is over ana we feel that we can
Securely comence ope:‘ations, we plan on using the base for the following
efforts:

a, A supplementary photographic base. In tais connection th
request for adiitional Exactas and spotting scopes previously made
should be expedited. It is anticipated that much operationnforma-
tion will be develosed by this photograghic work showing thé various
associations between the people when they are at play in the ccspound
wnich can never be determined from the LIPSTICK-LIMITED coverage.
Visitors who seldoa leave the compound do engage in social activity

n the compound and can be phctographed for possible identificas
tion by the AEDIPPSKS. Items wiich are losded into the automobiles
for transportation to unknown points may be identified through this
coveraze, further, snould LIPSVICK/LINITED be terminated for any
reason, we would be able to continue some coverage fron this base.

be Observation by LIPSTICK-21 of the builsings and the activities
in the compound will furnish valuable information on the daily living
habits of the residents and their guests,

¢. ‘The LIPSTICK/LIDOMINO base, presently being occupied by LINCH-
FIN, is about 75 yards away from the LIMSRICK target while LIPSTICK,’
LICALLA is only about fifty feet. This base may assist the Head-
quarters technicians, who periodically use the LIPSTICK/LIDIHIN
base, for reasons of proximity and the use of tneir equipment from
a differant direction. ‘he exact use of the LIFSTICX/LICALIA base
in this respect mst be determined by the Headquarters technicians
who are familiar with tne equipment used,

a, Conversations in the LIMERICK compound are audible to soneone
whe is listening from the maid's roon, Naturally street noises and
extraneous sounds interfere considerably wita tuis eavesdropping so
that the enploynent of sone parabolic microphone ai recorder mist

“be used for optiman results.

e. Should future operations provide the orportunity to install a
transmitter micropnone(resonant cavity) in some iten carried into
the LDGAICK target, LIFSTICK/LICALLA would serve as an excellent
base since it has direct line of sigyt to the bick of the LIMERICK
target.

f£, Prelinina-y investigation reveals that the possibility does

of this type of operation.

7. As stated in pars zrachs tao and three above, LIPSTICK~21 has undergone
corsiderable personal sacrifice to accommodate this Station in this opera-
tion. It has always been the practice to pay a base house operator &
starting salary of approximately $120.00 U.S, per moath, since the work

of operating a base house {3 almost full-time, LIPSTICK~21 now earns
$64.00 U.S. for work of approxivately four hours per day. It is therefq re
