North Vietnam -

South Vietnam

a. North Vietnamese leaders

are pressing their campaign for neu-

tralization of South Vietnam.

b. They can count on Cambodia's

support. Prince Sihanouk has said

he believes neutralization of South

Vietnam to be the only way to keep

his country and the rest of the area

from falling eventually into Commu-

nist hands.

c.

The French feel the same

way.

Indeed,

Souvanna Phouma re-

portedly told a closed session of

the Laotian National Assembly that

the French were urging him to sup-

port Hanoi in this.

d. Moreover, according to one

of our clandestine sources, the North

Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into

backing the neutralization proposi-

tion in the UN.

e.

The troublesome Polish ICC

delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who

will be going home soon, has just

returned to Vientiane from Hanoi anc

is trying, with somewhat less suc

cess, to enlist British support too.

Laos

f. As part of the same campaign,

the North Vietnamese have told the

French they believe sentiment is

growing in the US for withdrawal of

us forces. They reportedly plan to

keep the heat on to encourage it.

g. Hanoi is at the same time

trying quietly to encourage the belief

that it is ready to be reasonable.

h.

To hear Thee tell it, North

Vietnamese leaders feel that neutral-

ity for South Vietnam and

eventual

reunification is the only way they,

too, can escape from Peiping's clutches.

As is usual in Laos, the

tentative agreement for a cease-fire

reached last week between Kong Le

and Pathet Lao commander Singkapo

came to naught.

Each side accuses the other

of planning to use a cease-fire to

screen preparations for larger at-

tacks.

There is scattered fighting

in the Plaine des Jarres.

Lao Army,

neutralist, and Meo guerrilla ele-

ments are jointly engaged in a

limited offensive in the Vang Vieng

area north of Vientiane on Route 13.

They

hope to gain control of that

town

and its small airfield.

d.

We have been anticipating

an expansion of the fighting with

the recent advent of the dry season.

a. Sihanouk knows his actions

against us have increased his vul-

nerability to the Communist bloc, and

he is looking to the French to bail

him out.

He has intimated that aid

from France would be most welcome,

and he has asked that French advisors

stay on.

He apparently hopes that

the availability of French aid will

enable him to keep his balance with

the Communists and fend off their

pressure.

d. The French have told our

Embassy in Paris that plans are

afoot for French Defense Minister

Messmer to go to Cambodia in January®

Yemen-Egypt

e .

Sihanouk's actions toward

the US have not been universally

popular.

This is particularly true

among government officials, the bus-

iness community (who have reason to

fear stepped-up nationalization),

and the military, where the US re-

tains a considerable reservoir of

goodwill.

f. Indications are that Si-

hanouk will try to win fuller sup-

port by creating new feuds with

neighboring South Vietnam and Thai-

land.

This is a gambit he has used

to advantage in past difficulties.

A number of Yemeni leaders

have told us they want the Egyptians

to get out of the Yemen. They want

to be left alone to

solve their own

problems.

b. This is especially true

of those Sheikhs with large tribal

followings.

A general uprising against

the Egyptians is not likely at the

moment, but the longer they remain,

the greater the possibility of major

pro-government tribes deserting to

the royalists.

d. Nasir, with some 30,000

troops in the Yemen, has grudgingly

promised to pull out 5,000 before

the end of the year.

So far there

has

been

no sign he is preparing to

do so.

e.

So far as we can tell,

Faysal has kept to his promise not

to supply the Royalists before the

latest extension of the UN observa

tion mission runs out on 4 January.

f. But he has made plain his

intention to resume supplying them

thereafter.

There has been a sub-

stantial build up of Saudi supply

points north of the border.

5.

Italy

a.

The Christian Democrats

and Socialists have finally reached

an agreement on cabinet assignments

and a program for a "centerleft"

coalition government.

b. Negotiations were especially

tough, but apparently

President

Kennedy's death acted

as a catalyst,

to bring the two together.

NOTES

India-USSR

The Indian military attache in Moscow

feels that the Russians are dragging their feet in

the matter of military assistance for India. Mean-

while, we have a report (not yet confirmed) from

New Delhi that Defense Minister Chavan has decided

to look to us hereafter for fighter aircraft.

USSR

Our Embassy in Moscow has gotten word of

Leningrad.

clear, but bread shortages apparently were behind

the Leningrad strikes. Similar disturbances were

reported last month from several points in southern

Russia.

We do not yet have any in-

formation on how differences in key

issues such as MLF were worked out.

d. With Moro premier, Nenni

will probably become vice-premier.

Saragat, who is pro-US and pro-NATO,

is most likely to be named Foreign

Minister.
