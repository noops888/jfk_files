THE PRESIDENT’S
INTELLIGENCE CHECKLIST

ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

HW 50955 DocId:32205073 Page 2

24 NOVEMBER 1963
TOP SECRET


1. North Vietnam - a. North Vietnamese leaders
South Vietnam are pressing their campaign for neu-
tralization of South Vietnam.

b. They can count on Cambodia's
support. Prince Sihanouk has said
he believes neutralization of South
Vietnam to be the only way to keep
his country and the rest of the area
from falling eventually into Commu-
nist hands.

c. The French feel the same
way. Indeed, Souvanna Phouma re-
portedly told a closed session of
the Laotian National Assembly that
the French were urging him to sup-
port Hanoi in this.

d. Moreover, according to one
of our clandestine sources, the North
Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into
backing the neutralization proposi-
tion in the UN.

e, The troublesome Polish ICC
delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who
will be going home soon), has just
returned to Vientiane from Hanoi and
is trying, with somewhat less suc-
cess, to enlist British support too.

f. As part of the same campaign,
the North Vietnamese have told the
French they believe sentiment is
growing in the US for withdrawal of
US forces. They reportedly plan to
keep the heat on to encourage it.

g. Hanoi is at the same time
trying quietly to encourage the belief
that it is ready to be reasonable.

h. To hear Thee tell it, North
Vietnamese leaders feel that neutral-
ity for South Vietnam and eventual
reunification is the only way they,
too, can escape from Peiping's clutches,

2. Laos a. As is usual in Laos, the
tentative agreement for a cease-fire
reached last week between Kong Le
and Pathet Lao commander Singkapo
came to naught.

b. Each side accuses the other
of planning to use a cease-fire to
screen preparations for larger at-
tacks.

c. There is scattered fighting
in the Plaine des Jarres. Lao Army,
neutralist, and Meo guerrilla ele-
ments are jointly engaged in a
limited offensive in the Vang Vieng

area north of Vientiane on Route 13,
They hope to gain control of that
town and its small airfield.

d. We have been anticipating
an expansion of the fighting with
the recent advent of the dry.season,

3. Cambodia a. Sihanouk knows his actions
against us have increased his vul-
nerability to the Communist bloc, and
he is looking to the French to bail

\ him out,

b. He has intimated that aid
from France would be most welcome,
and he has asked that French advisors
stay on,

c. He apparently hopes that
the availability of French aid will
enable him to keep his balance with
the Communists and fend off their
pressure.

d. The French have told our
Embassy in Paris that plans are
afoot for French Defense Minister
Messmer to go to Cambodia in January.

e. Sihanouk's actions toward
the US have not been universally
popular. This is particularly true
among government officials, the bus-
iness community (who have reason to
fear stepped-up nationalization),
and the military, where the US re-
tains a considerable reservoir of
goodwill.

f. Indications are that Si-
hanouk will try to win fuller sup-
port by creating new feuds with
neighboring South Vietnam and Thai-
land. This is a gambit he has used
to advantage in past difficulties.

a. A number of Yemeni leaders
have told us they want the Egyptians
to get out of the Yemen. They want
to be left alone to solve their own
problems,

b. This is especially true
of those Sheikhs with large tribal
followings.

c. A general uprising against
the Egyptians is not likely at the
moment, but the longer they remain,
the greater the possibility of major
pro-government tribes deserting to
the royalists.

d. Nasir, with some 30,000
troops in the Yemen, has grudgingly
promised to pull out 5,000 before
the end of the year. So far there
has been no sign he is preparing to
do so.

e. So far as we can tell,
Faysal has kept to his promise not
to supply the Royalists before the
latest extension of. the UN observa-
tion mission runs out on 4 January.

f£. But he has made plain his
intention to resume supplying them
thereafter, There has been a sub-
stantial build up of Saudi supply
points north of the border,

5. Italy a. The Christian Democrats
and Socialists have finally reached
an! agreement on cabinet assignments
and a program for a "centerleft"
coalition government,

b. Negotiations were especially
tough, but apparently President
Kennedy's death acted as a catalyst,
to bring the two together, «

NOTES

India-USSR The Indian military attache in Moscow
Feels that the Russians are dragging their feet in
the matter of military assistance for India, Mean-
while, we have a report (not yet confirmed) from
New Delhi that Defense Minister Chavan has decided
to look to us hereafter for fighter aircraft.

USSR Our Embassy in Moscow has gotten word of
Strikes recently at Ryazan, near Moscow, and in
Leningrad. The cause of the Ryazan incident is not
clear, but bread shortages apparently were behind
the Leningrad strikes, Similar disturbances were
reported last month from several points in southern
Russia.

ce. We do not yet have any in-
formation on how differences in key
issues such as MLF were worked out,

d. With Moro premier, Nenni
will probably become vice-premier.
Saragat, who is pro-US and pro-NATO,
is most likely to be named Foreign
Minister.
