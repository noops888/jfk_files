A report dated 17 June 1963, stated that Oscar CONCEPCION Mendoza
had been appointed Commeréial Attache ‘to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City, replacing Benigno CASTELLAR Sanchez.

Tae following information was received by a-member of a gf
Cuban emigres trained in the technique of informatioir col
who haye provided ‘useful. reports for two years, from an untested
source concerning information on Oscar ‘CONCEPCION Mendoza.” The
report was dated 4 November 1963.

CONCEPCION was born in Ctego, de: Ayala, am
Cuba, about 1933. .-He is. white, five Teete¢
150 pounds; and has brown hair.. .c.waS a mémber of the 26th
of July Movement, during the fight against the Batista regime.
“CONCEPCION arrived in the city of. Camaguey shortly after, the.
Hubert MATOS incident in 1959 and began ‘eniploymenat ag a member
of the Cuban Intelligence Service, then -called:"G-2". According
to rumors, he has taken courses in political and revolutionary
instruction, and is a militant member pf ‘the Communist Party.
He has participated in almost all of the revolutionary trials
in Camaguey, and also the execution of "Billy" PATTEN in March
1961. He participated in the wholesale arrest of persons at the
time of the Giron invasion, and arrested a few thousand
Camagueyans who were believed to be anti-Communist or opponents
of the regime. CONCEPCION and Eliseo ALTUNAGA, also a member
of the G-2, committed thefts in the city of Camaguey amounting
to almost 2,000,000 pesos and for this reason CONCEPCION was
transferred to Oriente Province. While in Camaguey he was
Chiez of Operations of the State Security Department.

A ustially reliable source, in a report dated 7 January 1964, said
that on 18 December 1963, one "Augusto" was at the gate of the Cuban
Eubassy in Mexico City to see Oscar CONCEPCION. “Augusto” has long
been in seemingly clandestine contact with CONCEPCION and "Augusto"
also appears to be engaged in assisting unspecified people, sometimes
Yenezuelans, to travel to Cuba.

A usually reliable ‘source reported that Oscar CONCEPCION Mendoza
arrived in Mexico City from Habana on 16 January 1964. He carried
Cuban Diplomatic passport number D/63/403.

An fofficiallairlist revealed that Oscar CONCEPCION Mendoza arrived
in Mexico City from Habana on 24 April 1964. On 11 May 1964, he
arrived in Mexico City from Habana, with his wife, Marta CABALLERO
Carder, and two children, Marta CONCEPCION Caballero and Teresa
CONCEPCION Caballero.
