Mr. David A. Phillips

Bethesda, Maryland 20034

Dear Dave:

. The ordinary retirement letter is in no way
appropriate for you. In the first place, your
retirement is no stepping out of the active world
into.a world of pleasure. Instead, you are launch-
ing of€ on even a tougher challenge because of your
sense of dedication. Your retirement also will not
be the termination of your interest in intelligence
and in this Agency. Instead, you are going to be
doing what you can to help it surviva the current
set of attacks upon it. But most of all, your
retirement is the departure of one of our most
exceptional officers, to whom I had the great
pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Medal
and whose work I have admired these many years. The
only thing ordinary about your retirement is the
sincere and special personal and official good wishes
we in the Agency send -to you and your family for
success and satisfaction in the years ahead, This
we send to all our retirees, and we send it to you
with special spirit.

Sincerely,

pe ghee

MEMORANDUM FOR:
‘THROUGH :
SUBJECT + Notification -of Designation as a Participant in the Organlzation
Retirement and Disability System
REFERENCE : Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965

BK: You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement
and Disability System and have been so designated effective 23 October 1966.

2 Although such designation under present statutes Is viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such
a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An
appeal with reasons therefore must be. received In Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may
have in connection with your deslgnation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced

Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters,

“3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee.at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would reeeive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System, Because of this, the polley
decision has been made that.a participant in the Organization System who would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. ‘Thus,
you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your

designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

"MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division
THROUGH : Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : Commendation

> one 1, +The Station has distinguished itself by
: especially meritorious service during the past year and has made
a major contribution toward the advancement of the objectives of.
the United States Government in a critical situation. One year ago
the people of the were facing a dismal future.
Today; while the future remains uncertain, the prospects for even-
tual stability havé been immeasurably increased, Several Depart-
ments and Agencies of the United States Government engaged in an
effort to-bring this about. I believe that the role of the CIA in the
during the past year was a crucial one. The
highly effective performance of a the
Base was the reoult of the combined efforts of each offi-
cer and employee stationed there. These men and women gave un-
sparingly of their time, encrgy and brain power. Their efforts
were sustained over a long period under stressful circumstances.
Now, while our long-term mission continues, a significant mile~
- stone has been reached and it is most appropriate at this time to

grant this special recognition for a job well done to'all members
of the GIA team in thet luring the year ending

June 30, 1966,

2, I should like to commend each member of the Station who
contributed to this noteworthy performance and request that a copy
of this commendation be placed in individual personnel files as ap-

propriate.

To : David A. Phillips

SUBJECT: TDY in

Most of you who went down to

jony that
lain the importance and urgency
uu have served there
during the crisis, the impertance of the task needs no
embellishment trom us, but you should know that the con=
tribution of the augmented Station was decisive in shs
the policies and actions ef the government and in av
several major mistakes. (For wecks after the revolu-
tion, our Station reporting was literally the only source
of information that the Uuited States had on the role of
Communism among the rebel forces and on conditions outside
the capital,

Many fine things were done in the Station and in the
hinterland by a¥l-of you. Manning the check-points under
fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons
of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications
line, toiling over midnight reports, and keeping open our
country's only commo link ~~ all these things were common=
place, The dedication, discipline, and routine of our
personnel placed them in a class apart.

there was no time to exp

To the sense of pride and accomplishment you must
already feel, I want to add the gratitude and admiration
of the DDP and of the Agency.

Mr, Phillips is a highly experienced senior operations officer with
outstanding leadership ability, In both the Chief of Station positions
covered by this report his performance was superior in every important
respect,

8 Jan 1974



SECRET

SECTION D + NARRATIVE COMMENTS. :

1. In the périod covered-by this report Mr. Phillips was the Chief of
Statio during the°time frame February to August 1972. After‘ that
Mr. Phillips became the Chief of Station,(_pnd ‘served i
during the periud August 1972 to April 1973. At both of these posts Mr.
Phillips was responsible for managing an average of[_|Agency employees.
“Additionally, Mr. Phillips supervised in this period an average FY budget of

hich was spent on FI, CA, Cl, anti-narcotics and protected
economic intelligence operations. American policy interests in[_____Jand
jare high in terma of the United States scale of values for Latin
America. This means that Mr. Phillips was assigned to two prestige posts
during a fifteen month time span,

2, Age amanager Mr. Phillipg is operations oriented. In view of this he
places his time, attention and command emphasis on programs that are de-
signed to acquire intelligence and agents. This approach has consistently
produced results in terms of FI and CA operations.which are targeted against

the host;country. \

3. Mr. Phillips was also active at both posts as an operations manager

who focused Station resources on the Soviet target, protected economic in-

” telligence and the anti-narcotics effort. Unfortunately, as these programs
moved into year Mr. Phillips was also in motion between Stations, or had
just been in place at his second Station for less than a year. As a result one
can only say that Mr. Phillips made all the right moves in his managerial
duties against these priority targets. The brevity of his program imple-
mentation at each of the two posts did not provide a solid.basis, however, for
measuring tangible succesa, In short Mr, Phillips deserves high marks for
initiative, drive and imagination on programs that were receiving incrcased

attention at Headquarters.

4, Vhe myriad problems that are faced when a Station moves its location
from one city to another were still challenging Mr. Phi s when he left \
In overview terms, however, the move from| to
was well done. This does not mean that Mr. Phillips’ successor at
ldid not have some gaps to fill or adjustments to make in the admini-

strative field. The scope of these actions, however, was inthe realm of the
reasonable and attests to the fact that while his basic interests are in

operations, administration per se is not a totally alien field to Mr. Phillips.

5. In representational terms Mr. Phillips did a sound job in winning
and maintaining the respect of the American Ambassadors in| land
This is due in latge measure to Mr. Philli ive charm,
area knowledge, and language skills tn addition,
*M(r, Phillips is people oriented, and this makes it possible for him to sell
himself and CIA to senior American officials at the Ambassador level.

6. In personal terms M¢. “Phillips is a hard-woiking, dedicated officer
who is a good team player. This officer has the intent, capability and desire
to fulfill the needs of the Organization. He is particularly well versed ia CA
skills and is politically oriented. Asa result he likes the challenge of election

operations and is well qualified in this area.

7. Mr. Phillips! total performance during the period covered by this
report merits an evaluation of Strong.

+ 8 Interms of future assignments Mr. Phillips is likély to be at his pro-
fessional best in field activities, This officer is highly specialized in Latin
American affairs, but he is perfectly capable of being a Station Chief at most
_Agency posts in Europe or Asia.

9. Mr. Phillips’ activities come to the attention of the Rating Officer
on a daily basis,

Mr. Phillips is a highly capable, versatile and imaginative

“Operations Officer and manager who makes a substantial contri~

immediate and enthusiastic endorsement from the Deputy Director
for Plans and the Director for Mr. Phillips' assignment. He

it ia an outstanding manner,

My first statement is further borne out by the fact that
Ambassador ona recent visit to Washington, made

Mr. Phillips! support to him and the Embassy and to express
further his appreciation to the Agency for furnishing him aman
of Mr. Phillips’ caliber.

6 June 1969

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Mr, David A, Phillips
1 April 1968 to 31 Macch 1969

Mr, Phillips-continues to head the Division's program
against the high-priority Cuban target, although he hag also been
selected to fill an unusually responsible job overseas in the
coming year, both of which jobs testify to the high regard in which
he is held by his superiors in the Agency, Mr. Phillips has kad
the difficult task of presiding over a show which is being cut back,
in terms of money and people, and in which task he has played a
major role, At the same time as doing a pruning job, he haa had
to try to maintain a vigoroue program and to keep up enthusiasm,
His own qualities of personal leadership and of magnetism have
done a great deal to keep up enthusiasm among his people. He has
a positive attitude toward-operations and is determined; his day-
to-day concern is for devcloping new operations, and he has put
all of his own notable vigor and drive into operational directions,

Mr. Phillips knows his target and knows Latin America
well and he brings a good feel and insight into his work, which is
never pedestrian or unimaginative. He speaks well and convinc-
ingly and makes a very good impression both within the Agency and
outside, where he serves the Agency well in his relations with
other government elements, He also writes notably well.

His task this year has not been easy for he has had to deal
with an experimental situation, to a considerable extent, with the
new Miami station which he is responsible for supporting and
guiding. He has had to exercise a good deal of tact and diplomacy
in the doing of it and he has done a good job of reconciling often
conflicting views. He has shown a good head for costs in all of

this.



Mr, Phillips is a notably good supervisor, especially
with younger officers, for whom he is an object of admiration
and emulation, Mr. Phillips is a fast-moving, energetic: person
and he has some of the faults that often go with this virtue: he is
impatient with details and "paper" with the consequence that if
someone else does not do it for him, his work'is sometimes
marred by inaccuracies and imprecisions.

Without going into it, it should be noted that Mr. Phillips
has had a very trying year personally and it is a proof of his
* strength of character that he has not only come through it but has
hardly broken his stride in carrying out a demanding job, or being
any less than his usual cheerful and charming self.

His performance has been very Strong.

any touch with him, I believe ‘that I am in position to evaluate his

performance.

Let me say at the outset that the Rated Officer has had to work
-under the most varied and difficult circumstances. His service at
began, for example, in a revolutionary situation marked by
great and continuing violence. The attention of a good part of the
world was focused upon this situation, and some of the highest national

added greatly. to the dimensions of the work done by the Rated Officer.
In the aftermath of revolution, he had unusual, delicate and complicated

To this intricate complex of circumstances, the CAS Station Chief
has brought a background knowledge of the Latin American area and its

people as well asa proficiency in Spanish which has enabled him
. to deal readily and effectively with a heterogeneous ‘range of
contacts.

His performance can only be described as outstanding. -He
has provided a completely professional response to a most diffi-
cult and varied challenge. He has mounted an organization and
provided a mechanism fully up to the tasks. confronting it and
the high-level requirements levied upon it. With the advantages
afforded by hindsight, I suggest that the success which has been
achieved Speaks for itself.

It is pertinent to mention that the Rated Officer invariably
places business ahecd of pleasure and personal interests. He
works long and irregular hours and is continuously available in
time of need. He has eyidenced the highest deqree of cooperation

with representatives of”

team player who genuinely wants to be of assistance to all members

great part to the tactful, skillful and thoughtful leadership of

There is probably little need for me to comment upon the *

Penetration of subversive groups has reached impressive pr

with his terminating an outstandingly successful and very complicated
assignment as Chief of Station, This report deals
with a completely different situation, i,e, coming into Headquarters as
Chief, Cuban Operations Group at the time that drastic’ reduction had
just become the order of the day, The same energy, imagination and
zeal which has characterized Mr, Phillips over the years has
characterized his performance in this difficult task since his
assumption of the new responsibility, He has been a prime mover in
reducing the Headquarters WH/COG component to realistic and
managable proportions, By the same token he has been a prime mover,
guider, cajoler and sometimes "patron gaint" to JMWAVE rnanagement
in its massive job of bringing JMWAVE down from its ponderous
proportions to a viable Clandestine Services "instrument" compatible
and consistent with the present day needs of Cuban 6perations, In this
endeavor Mr, Phillips accomplishments have been of the first order,

This is a very fine officer with one of the best potentials in WH Division. 1
believe the rater is somewhat carried away in his views. Mr. Phillips!
career advancement has been closely observed in this Division and I do not
believe he is falling behind in the promotion timetable. It is definitely
expected he will be recommended next year (which is within the proper time

Fitness Report - “David A, Phillips
SECTION G {Continued)

Most important however, and this is one of Mr, Paillips
unique qualities, he has been able to bring about this drastic
reduction and at the same time instill enthusiasm in his stafi for
new approaches to the ever more difficult Cuban target, His own
infectious enthusiasin and his fine manner with co-workers and
subordinates has made this possible. In shert the Rating Oificer
believes he is the right man at the right time for the job he is in.

Mr, Phillips! relations with the Department of State and
other agencies where it really counts are outstandingly good. He
has in his shert time back re-established his fine relationship with
the manager of the Voice of America, Thi relationship will
undoubtedly be of inestimable value ia getting WH Division's new
radio effort through the 303 Committee and into operation,

It is probably obvious to one reading this fitness report that
the Rating Ofticer is well disposed towards Mr, Phillips, This is
quite true, It in no way, however, affects the Rating Officer's
opinion that Mr, Phillips is a man of considerable talent who for
one reason or another has fallen at least one grade behind in the
promotion timetable, The Rating Officer, therefore, trusts that
this will be corrected in the near future, Mr, Phillips is « gentleman
of breadth, drive, imagination and dedication, The Rating Officer
considers Mr, Phillips to be one of the very best of the many fine
officers he has known in his career in the Clandestine Services. In
gome ways he is unique in that he knows the business from the ground
up, having started in {several assignments) and now
having moved into the managerial area wygMe he can speak with
authority based on valid experience,

Mr, Phillips is neating completion of his tour of duty as Chief
of Station, During'the past several months he has had*
the difficult task of reorgamzing his Station and redirecting its manpower
following’a major election operation. His task has been made more
difficult by a serics of almost weekly political or security crises whick
not only required intensive intelligence coverage but also frequently
involved Station asscts,

: Mr. Phillipa has done remarkably well in this difficult regearing
* process, It has in no way affected the volume or quality of Station
“reporting which remains very high. His critical analysis and in-depth
interpretation of the rapidly changing political scene have been timely
and useful,

The Station under his direction has aggressively undertaken the
development of new Fl and Cl assets without losing momentum in existing
operations, Also ina rclatively short period of time effective security

Fitness Report - David A, Phillips

SECTION C’ - Continued:

Perhaps the outstanding quality which Mr. Phillips has demon-
strated‘is his"ability to "fire up" his people to produce at their
maximum capacity. Another outstanding characteristic is his diplo-
matic manner of dealiag with other officials. Of particular note is
the fact that Subject's relationship with Ambassador Jot the OAS
has been the President's principal representative in

jare closer and more fruitful than the relation=
h Arnbassador This has in no way
damaged the close relationship Subject has with the Embassy and other

government officials,

who,

Subject had little managerial experience of the scope required
by his present position prior to his arrival in nor had he had
much experience in FI matters, He has adapted readily however, and
h€ continued to broaden in these respects with the passage of time,

Cost consciousness is, of course, a relative thing, Mr, Phillips
asa CA operator "thinks big." However, it is clear that he weighs
heavily costs against anticipated results and expects to get a dollar
return for each one spent, Overall Subject can be described asa very
able person, His ability to maintain Station morale at a high level while
producing at a very gruelling pace under difficult conditions is in itself
an outstandin accomplishment. Mr. Phillips has been recommended
for ar Agency Award.

“le, David A.. Phillips is retiring after a
Astinguished career with the Agency. He has been
nh ‘émployee of Aad Agency since 1951 when he bel iene

‘Joined asa

A true DDOer, fifteen years of this glorious and
active career were spent overseas, His outstavding
dedication and devotion to the cause of freedom won
for him in 1956, the Intelligence Medal of Merit.

Jiis file is replete with letters of commendation

aud appreciation from the DCI, DDCI, the former
Ambassadors,

Tandy r

and military commanders, all of whom recognized the
uniquoness of his outstanding service. Mr. Phillips
has been highly effective as a senior member of the
Latin American Division which has been under his
immediate command since 1973. An excerpt from a
late fitness report nicely characterizes the caliber
of his work. "It is as a seniox operations officer
that sir. Phillips has had the greatest experience,
and it is not surprising that he has made an excel<
lent input into the improvement of operational
matters throughout the many areas of this hemisphere
for which he is responsible," Mr, Phillips will be
remembered for his initiative, drive and imagination,
and for the excellence of his representational
responsibilities which in large part is attributable
to his native charm, area knowledgeability and
superb language skills. IIe will be remembered for
his intent capability and desire to fulfill the
neods 0: the Organization, It is fitting and proper
that upon his retirement, Mr. Phillips be recognized
with the award of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.

grueling GS-16 Evaluation Exercise at my direction.
The recommendations for promction and executive
development. you gave me were’ a major factor in my
recommendations to the Director for the upward
movement of officers who will be the top management
cadre of the Directorate in the near future.

I believe you will find that the last several
weeks will have sharpened your focus on one of our

most important management responsibilities, our
personnel. Many thanks for a job well done.

: David 9 PHfiIPS

1, I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the outstandin; tributions:
you and your staff have made in the accomplishment of Intelligence
missions from 1 May 1965 through 17 January 1966. The first intelligence contact
upon our arrival i pn 1 May was a representative from your

office. From that day on a mutual respect, cordial relationship and a unity of
effort prevailed throughout the many trying days in the| crisis,
Without your assistance we would have realized a serious gap in the intelligence

picture, a gap which would have made intelligence evaluations and the development
of tactical estimates most difficult,

2. My[_]has frequently mentioned the close association and cnordination he
has had with you and the members‘of your organization and repeatedly expressed
the-high estcem and respect he has for the professionalism and competence
displayed by you and your subordinates.

3. The intelligence unity of effort in has been exemplary
and a prototype for future operationis.. This cohesive atmosphere is directly
attributable to your efferts,

Qs.

4 March 1975

erruuae ON REQUEST FOR CREDITABLE SERVICE: August 1950 Until 3 March

1. -A basic document in consideration of this request is HCSA-825,
dated 4 February. 1954.

2. [was running an English-language newspaper
when: asked to work with our Station there. My first

CS:
1064 asks that the first payment be made to the U.S. -bank on 1 August
3950.

3. Ouring this period I recall a number of activities undertaken
” for the Station, and I’ travelled to New York for clandestine training.
The file indicates “He was originally approved operationally t? handle
the complex Soviet espionage case of FULMINATER-2. His conduct of this
case was considered -excellent...." Also, "It will be recalled that
Headquarters was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done.”
The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I stayed be-
hind in my plant after the employees had left for the night, printing
leaflets, booklets, etc. I also handled agents and did a number of
spotting and-assessing jobs for the Station.

4. I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for $500.00 per month
which ran until the termination date of 31 August 1953. (Actually this
was in the form of a loan which was paid off at the rate of $500.00. The
advance was used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do
certain work for the Station, but which I retained.)

5. After termination of the contract on 31 August I remained in|
until 4 March 1964. Ourirg this period I recruited a CP agent who st
works for the Station--and was a cabinet member under Allende. On 3 Febru-
ary 1954 Headquarters asked that I be made available for another assignment.
The Station pointed out that I was working on the recruitment, and that [
and my family were planning on-a European vacation. Headquarters again
cequested my assignment. Thus I departed for the project tn
early March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets paid for
by advertising in'my paper} and leaving my family behind to pack up. [
accepted this assignment without knowing where it was, or for how long it
would last. Indeed | did not even have a contract.

March 1954. I was always avail-

1950 until departure for PBSUCCESS on

iy own.. Thus I-request that all or part of this time. be approved as

A problems involved‘in any-of the foregoing and that the material can be

readily cut to fit thé-pattern, It is the recommendation of Mr. Barnes in

which I concur, oy en assigned to the PP Staff during his

tour of duty here, He could in this capacity work very closely with WH

ce ‘Division, but it seems to Tracy and myself that-he can contribute importantly
to the work of the PP Staff-and in the process broaden himself. As regards
the matter of the lectures, [would recommend that arrangements be made
to ‘permit and even encourage him to continue these since it seems to me
that they would fit-in very well with his general PP assignment -- assuming, of
course, that his Headquarters, and field cover are properly designed and main-
tained, The Headquarters cover’problem is nota substantial one and as far.
as the field ia concerned i were to go cover
of the right kind this also should present no problem. There is a ready-
made cover in the field and in‘a critically important country by virtue of

his ownership -- for some six y
would not be incompatible with his resumption of his positi
editor of thel Inewspapaer to work in an annua} series of lectures
cither in Latin América of in the United States. There is only one further
point involved in connection with the lectures: Because of,

intimate association with many of the details of PBSUCCESS and also in
light of the standing rules of the Agency, it would be desirable for him to
submit at least in general outlines, and preferably textually to the extent
feasible, the substance of his proposed lectures. He is anxious to do this

in connection with the forthcoming lectures -- fer his own piece of mind

since he would like to be double-checked on.the things which he should say-
and those which he should not say with respect to the Guatemalan development.
He could and in the material to Mr. Holcomb or myself -- or to you -- and
after it has been checked over by one of us, we could arrange to submit it

to tne Office of Security fer such further checking as may be desirable.

4. (___] proposes to take a leave of absence of a month or

six weeks, starting within the next few days. 1 behieve it would be
desirable for Mr. Baker, to start the necessary personnel and other admin-
