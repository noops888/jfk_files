Dear Dave:

The ordinary retirement letter is in no way

In the first place, your

retirement is no stepping out of the active world

Into a world of pleasure.

Instead, you are launch-

ing off on even a tougher challenge becauge of your

sense of dedication.

Your retircment also will not

be the termination of your interest

in intelligence

this Agency.

Instead, you are going to be

doing what you can to help it survivo the current

set of attacks upon it.

But most of all, your

rotirement is the departure of one of our most

exceptional officers,

to whom I had the great

pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Medal

and whose work I have admired these many ycars.

only thing ordinary about your retirement is the

sincere and special personal and official good wishes

we in the Agency send to you and your family for

success and satisfaction in the years ahead. This

wa send to all our retirees, and we send it to you

Sincerely,

Jabout the turbulent eventa

in his country shree years ago.

"You know," he said, "looking back over those months when

things seemed pretty bleak, two names come immedialely to mind

as able and effuctive representatives of the United States. They

are Ellsworth Bunkor and David Phillips. "

MEMORANDUM FOR:

THROUGH

SUBJECT

REFERENCE

: Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization

Retirement and Disability System

: Book Dispatch 5098 dated 12 August 1985

•1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement

and Disability System and have been so designaled effective 23 October 1960.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons.

the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such

a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests.

In order that this

technical requircment may be satisfied, you are hereby notlfed of your right to appeal.

An

appeal with reasons therefore must be. received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of

this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed.

Any questions that you may

have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced

Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.

• 3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retrement System are superior to the

benefts of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which

an employce at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he

would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the pollcy

decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would recclve a

higher annulty under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-

ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System.

Thus,

you should not anticipate this contingency as a lactor in deciding whether you regaid your

designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

: Deputy Director for Plans

: Commendation

1. • The

Station has distinguished itself by

especially meritorious service during the past year and has made

• a major contribution toward the advancement of the objectives of

the United States Government in a critical situation. One year ago

the people of the

were facing a dismal future.

Today, while the future remains uncertain, the prospects for even

tual stability have been immeasurably increased. Several Depart-

ments and Agencies of the United States Government engaged in an

effort to bring this about. I believe that the role of the ClA in the

highly effective performance of the

and the

Basc

cer and employee atationed there. These men and women gave un-

sparingly of their time, energy and brain power.

Their efforts

were sustained over a long period under stressful circumstances.

Now, while our long-term mission continues, a significant mile-

• stone has been reached and it is most appropriate at this time to

Jduring the year ending

June 30, 1966.

This report covers Mr. Phillips! initlal period as a division

Chief.: It coincided with a period of unusually high stress and

strain in the Western Hemisphere Division, particularly in relation

ships with the State Department and in the problems left over from

our drastic measures

designed to protect ourselves against a

potential counterintelligence disaster..

The most important fact to

be recorded: about Mr. Phillips' direction of his Division during

this period'is that he kept operations at the top of his priority

list, and that as a result our operational achievements in the area

during the past year have been on the whole better than in the year

before.

Mr. Phillips is developing into a very competent manager,

has handled well the problems involved in adjusting to decreasira

"manpower ceilings.

He is prudent in the use of official funds.

is a gond supervisor and is providing excellent leadership to hig

stibordinates,

who have responded with a clear improvement in morale

during the period. since Mr. Phillips assumed charge.

Fitness Report - David A. Phillips

Section D., Continued:

The most dramatic challenge to the capabilities of the

WH Division in the past year flowed from the overthrow of

the Allende government in Chile. Overall, the intelligence

reporting was timely and accurate, the adjustments to our

political action programs stillfully made, and the responses

to Congressional inquiry well handled.

It is as a senior operations officer that Mr. Phillips

has had the greatest experience, and it is not surprising

chat he has made an excellent input into the improvement of

operational matters throughout the many areas of this

hemisphere for which he is responsible.

handled the many and important senior liaison contacts which he

has

made during this year, both at Headquarters and during field

visits, with great effectiveness.

SECTION D

• NARRATIVE COMMENTS

1. In the period covered by this report Mr. Phillips was the Chief of

during the time frame February to August 1,972. Alter that

Mr. Phillips becaine the Chief of Station, [

and served in

during the period August 1972 to April 1973. At both of these posts Mr.

Phillips was responsible for managing an average of Agency employees.

Additionally, Mr. Phillips supervised in this period an average FY budget of

which was spent on FI, CA, Cl, anti-narcotics and protected

economic intelligence operations. American policy interests in and

Jare high in terms of the United States scale of values for Latin

America.

This means that Mr. Phillips was assigned to two prestige posts

during a fifteen month time apan.

As a nanager Mr. Phillipe is operations oriented. In view of this he

placee his time, attention and command emphasis on programs that are de-

signed to acquire intelligence and agents. This approach has consistently

produced results in terms of Fl and CA operations which are targcted against

the host. country.

3. Mr. Phillips was also active at both posts as an operations nanager

-who focused Station resources on the Soviet target, protected economic in-

telligence and the anti-narcotics effort.

Unfortunately, as these programs

moved into gear Mr. Phillips was also in motion between Stations, or had

just been in place at his second Station for less than a year. As a result one

can only say that Mr. Phillips made all the right moves in his managerial

duties against these priorily targets.

The brevity of his program imple-

mentation at each of the two posts did not provide a solid basis, however, for

measuring tangible succesa. In short Mr. Phillips deserves high marks for

initiative, drive and imagination on programs that were receiving increased

attention at Headquarters.

4. I'hr rnyriad problems that are faced when a Station moves its location.

In overview terms, however. the move from

was well done. This does not mean that Mr. Phillips' successor at

did not have some gaps to fill or adjustments to make in the admini-

strative field.

The scope of these actions, however, was in the realm of the

reasonable and attests to the fact that while his basic interests are in

operations, administration per se is not a totally alien field to Mr. Phillips.

5. Ir representational term's Mr. Phillips did a sound job in winning

and maintaining the respect of the American Ambassadors in.

This is due in large measure to Mr. Phillips' native charm,

area knowledge, and language skills|

In addition,

Mr. Phillips is people oriented, and this makes it possible for him to sell

himself and CLA to senior American officials at the Ambassador level.

6. In personal terms Mi. Phillips is a hard-working, dedicated officer

who is a good tear player. This officer has the intent, capability and desire

to fulfill the needs of the Organization. He is particularly well versed in CA

skills and is politically oriented. As a result he likes the challenge of election

operations and is well qualified in this area.

7. Mr. Phillips' total performance during the period covered by this

report merits an evaluation of Strong.

8. In terms of future assignments Mr. Phillips is likely to be at his pro-

jessional best in field activities.

This officer is highly specialized in Latin

American affairs, but he is perfectly capable of being a Station Chief at most

Agency posts in Europe or Asia.

%. Mr. Phillips' activities come to the attention of the Rating Officer

on a daily basis.

=:-

Mr. Phillips is a highly capable, versatile and imaginative

Operations Officer and manager who makea a substantial contri-

bution to the Clandestine Service.

The above statement is borne out by the fact that faced with

a highly difficult, sensitive operational problem of the utmost

priority in the fall of 1970, the Rater immediately thought of

Mr. Phillips as the man to head the Task Force and received

immediate and enthusiastic endorsement from the Deputy Director

for Plans and the Director for Mr. Phillips' assignment. He

was recalled fron

took over the Task Force, and handled

it in an outstanding manner.

My first statement is further borne out by the fact that

Ambassador

on a recent visit to Washington, made

a special effort to express to the Rater his appreciation for

Mr. Phillips' support to him and the Embassy and to express

further his appreciation to the Agency for furnishing him a man

of Mr. Phillips' caliber.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT:

Mr. David A. Phillips

1 April 1968 to 31 March 1969

Mr. Phillips continues to head the Division's program

against the high-priority Cuban target, although he has also been

selected to fill an unusually responsible job overseas in the

coming year, both of which jobs testify to the high regard in which

he is held by his superiors in the Agency. Mr. Phillips has had

the difficult task of presiding over a show which is being cut back,

in terms of noney and people,

and in which task he has played a

- major role. At the same time as doing a pruning job, he has had

to try to maintain a vigoroue program and to keep up enthusiasm.

His own qualities of personal leadership and of magnetism have

done a great deal to keep up enthusiasm among his people. He has

a positive attitude toward operations and is determined; his day-

to-day concern is for developing new operations, and he has put

all of his own notable vigor and drive into operational directions.

Mr. Phillips knows his target and knows Latin America

well and he brings a good feel and insight into his work, which is

never pedestrian or unimaginative. He speaks well and convinc-

ingly and makes a very good impression both within the Agency and

outside, where he serves the Agency well in his relations with

other government elements. He also writes notably well.

His task this year has not been easy for he has had to deal

with an experimental situation, to a considerable extent, with the

new Miami stalion which he is responsible for supporting and

guiding. He has had to exercise a good deal of tact and diplomacy

in the doing of it and he has done a good job of reconciling often

conflicting views. Hle has shown a good head for costs in all of

this.

## Page 156

Mr. Phillips is a notably good supervisor, especially

with younger officers, for whom he is an object of admiration

and emulation. Mr. Phillips is a fast-moving, energetic person

and he has some of the faults that often go with this virtue: he is

impatient with details and "paper" with the consequence that if

someone else does not do it for him, his work is sometimes

marred by inaccuracies and imprecisions.

Without going into it, it should be noted that Mr. Phillips

has had a very trying year personally and it is a proot of his

strength of character that he has not only come through it but has

hardly broken his stride in carrying out a demanding job, or being

any less than his usual cheerful and charming self.

His performance has been very Strong.

This report deals

with a completely different situation, i.e. coming into Headquarters as

Chief, Cuban Operations Group at the time that drastic reduction had

just become the order of the day. The same energy, imagination and

zeal which has characterized Mr. Phillips over the years has

characterized his performance in this difficult task since his

assumption of the new responsibility. He has been a prime mover in

reducing the Headquarters WH/COG component to realistic and

managable proportions. By the same token he has been a prime mover,

guider, cajoler and sometimes "patron saint" to JMWAVE rnanagement

in ite massive job of bringing JNWAVE down from its ponderous

proportions to a viable Clandestine Services "instrument" compatible

and consistent with the present day needs of Cuban operations.

In this

endeavor Mr. Phillips' accomplishments have been of the firat order.

COMMENTS OF REVIENINO OFFICIAL

This is a very fine officer with one of the best potentials in WH Division. I

believe the rater is somewhat carried away in his views.

Mr. Phillips'

career advancement has been closely observed in this Division and I do not

believe he is falling behind in the promotion timetable. It is definitely

expected he will be recommended next year (which is within the proper time

frame, ) if his current excellent performance continues.

Fitness Report - "David A. Phillips

SECTION C (Continued)

Most important however, and this is one of Mi. Phillips

unique qualities,

he has been able so bring about this drastic

reduction and at the same time instill enthusiasm in his stati for

new approaches to the ever more difficult Cuban target. His own

infectious enthusi.smn and his tine manner with co-workers and

subordinates has made this possible. In short the Rating Officer

believes he is the right man at the right time for the job he is in.

Mr. Phillips' relations with the Department of State and

other agencies where it really counts are outstandingly good. He

has in his short time back re-established his fine relationship with

¿ the manager of the Voice of America.

This relationship will

undoubtedly be or inestimable value in getting W'H Division's new

radio effort through the 303 Committee and into operation,

It is probably obvious to one reading this fitness report that

the Rating Officer is well disposed towards Mr. Phillips. This is

quite true. It in no way, however, altects the Rating Oificer's

opinion thas Mr. Phillips is a man d considerable lalent who sor

one reason or another has fallen at least one grade behind in the

promotion timetable.

The Rating Orticer, therefore, trusts that

this will be corrected in the near iuture. Mr. Phillips is i gentleman

of breadth, drive, imagination and dedication. The Rating Officer

considers ir. Phillips to be one of the very best of the many line

olficers he has known in his career in the Clandestine Services. In

some way's he is unique in that he knows the busines: iron the ground

up, having started in L

(several assignments) and now

having moved into the managerial area wife le can speak with

authority based on valid experience.

il roostred los currenp.position.

Mar 8. 3 30 911 6/.

Mr. Phillips is nearing completion of his tour of duty as Chief

of Station,

During the past several months he has had

the difficult task of reorganizing his Station and redirecting its manpower

following a major election operation. His tagk has been made more

difficult by a series of almost weekly political or security crises whick

not only required intensive intelligence coverage but iloo frequently

involved Station arsets.

: Mr. Phillipo has done remarkably well in this dil'icult regcaring

process.

It has in no way affected the volume or quality of Station

reporting which remains very high.. His critical analysis and in-depth

interpretation of the rapidly changing political scene have been timely

and useful,

The Station under his direction has aggressively undertaken the

development of new Fl and Cl assets without losing momentum in existing

operationa, Also in a relatively short period of time effective security

and countersubversion units within the host government internal security

apparatus have been establishede

This has in no wa

damaged the close relationship Subject has with the Embassy and other

government officials.

Subject had little managerial experience of the scope required

by his present position prior to his arrival in

I nor had he had

much experience in FI natters. He has adapted readily however, and

he continued to broaden in these respects with the passage of time.

Cost conscipusness is, of course, a relative thing. Mr. Phillips

as a CA operator "thinks big." However, it is clear that he weighs

heavily costs against anticipated results and expects to get a dollar

return'for each one spent. Overall Subject can be described as a very

able person.

His ability to maintain Station morale at a high level while

producing at a very gruelling pace under difficult conditions is in itself

an outstandin accomplishment. Mr. Phillips has been recommended

for an Agency Award.

Dear Dave,

You have just finished an important albeit

grueling GS-16 Evaluation Exercise at my direction.

The recommendations for promction and executive

development. you gave me were a major factor in my

recommendations to the Director for the upward

movement of officers who will be the top management

cadre of the Directorate in the near future.

I believe you will find that the last several

weeks will have sharpened your focus on one of our

nost important management responsibilities, our

personnel.

Many thanks for a job well done.

BACKGROUND

ON REQUEST FOR CREDITABLE SERVICE: August 1950 Unt1l 3 March

1954

•A basic document in consideration of this request is HCSA-825,

dated & February. 1954.

I was running an English-language newspaper

Pay ah north.

when-asked to work with our Station

first pay was 550.00 per

anarco

During this period I recall a number of activities undertaken

for the Station, and l travelled to New York for clandestine training.

The file indicates "He was originally approved operationally to handle

the complex Soviet espionage case of FULMINATER-2.

His conduct of this

case was considered excellent....

"It will be recalled that

Headquarters was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done."

The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I stayed be

hind in my plant after the employees had left, for the night, printing

leaflets..booklets, etc.

I also handled agents and did a number of

spotting

and-assessing jobs for the Station.

4. I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for $500.00 per month

which ran until the termination date of 31 August 1953.

(Actually this

was in the form of a loan which was paid off at the rate of $500.00.

The

advance was used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do

certain work for the Station, but which I retained.)"

After termination of the contract on 31 August I remained in

until 4 March 1954. During this period I recruited a CP agent who sttr

works for the Station--and was a cabinet member under Allende.

ary 1954 Headquarters asked that I be made available for another assignment.

The Station pointed out that I was working on the recruitment, and that !

and my family were planning on a European vacation. Headquarters again

requested my assigment. Thus I departed for the

project in

early March, abandoning my free family trip to europe tickets paid for

would last. Indeed I did not even have a contract.

I worked for the Agency in

then, between I August

1950 until departure for PBSUCCESS on 4 March 1954.

I was always avail

able and when I finally.did leave it was for Agency business rather than

my own.

Thus I request that all or part of this time be approved as

creditable toward retirement.

To those of uncadguarter who have followed closely the

to this Operation and that he has demonstrated himself to be exceptionally

I have just been informed by lane canes and operation hat vee later

I have just been informad by Mesars. Barnes and

who has heretofore been employed in the capacity of a Contract Agent,

desires to become more closely associated with the Agency and would

like to be employed as a regular stall officer. Jam very much in favor of

following up

on this opportunity, and I have good reason to believe that

the Director likewise is specilically interested.

There are certain aspects of this case which appear to reguire

special haudling and tailoring - none of which presents any difficulties as

near term and longer range aspecte of the employment of

These aspects are as follows:

(a)

desires to begin his term of empluyment by

the Agency with a period of service at Headquarters. (He has spent

many years in Latin America, principally in

where he has

advantage still es a newaraper and in my sudment, it would be mutually

advantageous to the Agency and to

_for him to spend

not less than a year as a member of the Headquarters organization.)

series of lectures in various Latin American capilale.

have consisted of business and professional groups and women's organ

would be ready and able to accept a field assignment

in South America following the conclusion of the period of Headquarters'

duty referred to.

. 3.

As already indicated, it seems to me that there are no sérioue

problems involved in any of the foregoing and that the material can be

readily cut to fit the pattern. It is the recommendation of Mr. Barnes in

which I concur, that

Tbe assigned to the PP Staff during his

lour of duty here.

He could in this capacity work very closely with WH

Diviaion, but it seem's to Tracy and myself that he can contribute importantly

to the work of the PP Staff and in the process broaden himsell. As regards

the matter of the lectures, I would recommend that arrangements be made

lo permit and even encourage him to continue these since it seems to me

that they would fit in very well with his general PP assignment - assuming, of

course, that his Headquarters, and field cover are properly designed and mair-

tained.

Che Headquarters cover problem is not a substantial one and as fas

as the field ia concerned it

were to go [

of the right kind this also should present no problem.

There is a ready

his ownership - for some six years of a newspaper in

would not be incompatible with his resumption of his position ad owner and

edifor of the

newspaper to work in an annual sertes of lectures

either in Latin America or in the United States. There is only one further

poit involved in connection with the lectures: Because of

intimate association ivith many of the details of PBSUCCESS and also in

light of the standing rules of the Agency, it would be desirable for him to

submit at last in general outlines, and preferably textually to the extent

feasible, the substance of his proposed lectures.

He is anxious to do this

in connection with the forthcoming lectureg for his own piece of mind

since he would like to be double-checked on the things which he shoul say-

and those which he should not say with respect to the Guatemalan developmart.

He could and in the material to Mr. Holcomb or myself - or lo you - and
