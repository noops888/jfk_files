of a second, also of interest, which he will proceed to discuss to the
Confusion of the first. This problem was perhaps compounded by the
fact that Subject was uncertain as to the type of information of interest
to KUBARK. He grasped quicaly, however, he type of information
which would be of s:ost interest to us and tt rapidly became less difficult
to get to the meat af the subject we were discussing. Further contact
and debriefing of him will become progressively lesa difficult.

4. We are consolidating the informati«r obtained from Subject
from our two meetings with him on 2 and 4 May below for reporting

Convenience.

6. Basically Subject is able to supply specific information of
interest. on only five personalities. He knows and was acquainted with
many other personalities in the Cuban government, but his relationship
with them is not close enough to enable him to provide information in
sufficient detail or depth to allow valid assessment as to {heir suscep-
tibility to a recruitment or other operational approach.

6. Information on five Cuban government officials, well known
to Bubject is set forth below:

@, Esubio AZCUE, born about 1912, is presently
employed a3 a consul at the Cuban Embasay in Maxico
City. AZCUE is a long time friend of Subject. They met
during the mid-1950's when both were involved iu revolu-

ae tlonary aciivities attempting to bring about a democratic

socialist regime in Cuba. AZCUE is married tc a Spanish
woman and was involved in the Spanish revolution, He
was a vty close friend of Manolo CASTRO who was

ly murdered by a group of Communist left wing
revolutionaries which included Fids] CASTRO. About,
1663 AZCUE wes living in France and is believed to have
been arrested by French suthorities on charges resulting
from his involvement in smuggling penicitlin and other
antibiotics into France. Subject bejieves that AZCUE haa
” about five children, During exsly 1961 while in Mexico
City, AZCUE was contacted by Subject in order to obtain
advice re the advisability of his.defecting from the Castro
regime and requesting political asylum in Mexics, Asa

result of this contact Subject obtained the impresaion that
AZCUE 1s suffeving from a lack of funds. Since AZCUE
ig somewnat af a snob and 2 fancy dresser, he finds this
Situation unpleasant. AZCUE also habitually has a mis-
tress which in turn ie a drain oa his pockstbook,

(1) According to Subject, AZCUE is an
excellent draftsman who studied architecture
at Uae University of Habana, although he never
obtained a degree, Subject assesses him as a
kité man, very happy-go-lucky, but impetuous
and one who "blows with the wind", He doosn't
seem to have the powers of concentration or of
Bingle purpose which would allow him to be suc-
eesstul, Subject feels that ACCUE has appended
Rimself to the Castro reginie since it offers him
&@ purpose in Life and a feeling of belonging to
something.

@) Subject described AZCUE as being a
very brave man. He felt that should AZCUE.be
approached by KUBARK and requested to coop-
erste, the physical danger inherent to in-place

tae agent work would not affect his decision, In
6ummury there would be a reascaable chance of
persuading AZCUE to cooperate with KUBARK if
& suitable monetary and ideological inducement
“were offered him, Subject feels, on the basis of
their 1961 conversations in Mexico City, that
AZCUE is not too enthused about the Castro regime

and it is possible be has pecome even less in ee

i tion, is presently Charge d' Afta'rea of the Cuban Legation

H Secretary with the Cuban Ev-bassy in Biorocco. Subject

i Gescribed CHOM.ON as a senaitive, slightly effeminate
individual who ig relatively disinterested in politica. Sube
ject feels that C11O}:ON obtained the poaltion with the

CHOMON's brother, Subject {eels that F loreal CHOMON
would also welcome an opportunity to talk with him if the

fact of their meeting could be kept {rom the Cuban govern-

ment. He speculated that any attenspt to gain CHOMON's

cooperation would depend on the position Faure CHOMON

bas assumed toward the Castro regime, Subject feels

that most of Ficreal CASTRO's decisions are based on the

attitude and opinion of his older brother Faure, Lf through

these traces, it is suggested that a dispatch be prepared to Mexico City : ata

by Bubject, This dispatch would also outline Headquarters’ interest in

the Subject whether or not he wild be willing to travel to Mexico City

15. UFGA 7428, 31 January 1963, contains information obtained
by JMWAVE regarding Subject and indicated him to be emotionally un-
stable, eccentric, and generally reputed to be something of a mt. We
are inclined to agree with this information in go far ae Subject's eco-
nomical theory 43 concerned, During his stay of almost one year ag
an asylee in the-aszentine Embassy in Habana, Subject spent the copious
Spare time available to him writing an economic treatise, On our meet-
ing with Subject on May 4th, Subject provided us with a handwritten
short summary of this docament, According to this summary, Subject
has been attempting to correlate economic cycles with peaks of sunspot
activity. He backs up his "economic argument” with reference to the
Old Testament and the Aztec Calendar. If Subject has been ex;
this thoory in public we are not surprised that he is considered some-
what of a nut. It should be noted, however, that many otherwise sane
and useful people believe in horoscopes and other similar superstitions,
We do not feel that this quirk in his Personality must necessarily be con-
sidered derogatory in terms of his Possible operational exploitation by
KUBARK, Although we have spent less than ten hours with Subject, our
impression is that he is a rational individual in terms of hie attitude
towards and relationships with other individuals and personalities around
him, As & matter af fact, we obtained the impression that Sublect pos-
sesse8 more than his fair share of what is sometimes termed “common
sense". The handwritten summary of Subject's economic theory as per-
taining to cunspots ts appe.~ied to this memorandum as attachment,
