METORANDM FOR: Ar: James W. MeCond, Jr.

THROUGH

Head of 88 Career Service

SUBJECT

: Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a

Participant

in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1.

As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the esployment

history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify

those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CLA

Retirement and Disability Syster.

each case

is made by the individual's Career Servico. If the Head of his

Career Service nominates rim for participation in the syster, this nomina»

tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action

to me.

However; if che Head of the Carcer Service advises thät the employee

does not meet the basic requirements of MR 20-50 for participation, ! have

accepted

this finding without further review by the CIA Retiresent. Board.

This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening

process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in che

sys-

ten may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2.

In your case, the Head

of your Career Service has advised no that

you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation

as

a partici-

pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the

regulation that you are not eligible for designation.

From a revies of your

record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 years

of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months

of qualifying service as required by regulation.

My determination that you

are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current.

status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude recon-

sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should

meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3.

Should you desire further information concerning the requirenents

for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

JOU

read paragraph e of

HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin

cated. 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence

Azency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination.

nade_ in your case-may have-been incomplete

or inaccurate regarding

Your actual

employment history

with the. Agency.

If, after studying the materials cited

above, you have

questions regarding the determination that you are-not eligi-

ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact

officiais

of your Career Service..

They are familiar with the details of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

In addition, you may wish to dis-

cuss jour case with the CIA Retirement Staff located

in Room 6E-1319 Head-

quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questions

sou have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally

considered by the Board..

However, this request

must be made

within 30 days of

the date of this memorandum.

SUBJECT

NeCORD, James W., Jr. Emp. Ser. No. 58124

Fitness Report

Befittes ama: 8-1s.

This is an annual fitness sport covering the period

1 April 1969 through 31 March 1970,

Mr. McCord completed

his first full year as Chier. Physieal Scurity Division.

During

1969 the Division undersent many changes, a direct reault of the

personal efforta of this employee. He has shown the initiative

to sock out new ways and means to harden the security of our

domestic and overscas facilities by tapping all possible tech-

nological sources both in and out of Government. Mie efforts

have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture

in the physienl security field is far superior to any of our con

tenporaries.

2. With the

spiraling costs of manpower, Mr. McCord

has concentrated on the potential for use of technical devices to

replace the human asse:.

He has made reniarkable inronds into

this field by way of imagination, ingenuity and drive.

3. Mr. McCord has the quality to inspire hia subordinates.

He is demanding, but understanding. On more than one occasior.

he was asked to take under his wing employees who were labeled

"problems." Through personal intereat and effort, he has salvaged

the majority of these individuals to a point where they are performing

in a highly satisfactory manner.

I. In the previous fitness report, I alluded to the fact that

employee has a tendency to find it difficult to see another person's

point of view.. This, I feel, is attributable to an innate stubbornness

which obviously is difficult to overcome. Mr. McCord is a very

C din

## Page 94

principled individual who once convinced he has hit upon the proper

course of action will usually gield enly by direction. We're discussed

this, and l've noted a determined effort on his part to broaden his

tolerance for other opinions:

5. Overall, the employer has made a substantial contribution

to the Office of Securito by his dedication to hio job, his tenacious

attitude toward upgrading our physical security standards, a curious

and inventive mind ever searching dus better waya lo solve a problem

in hid area of responsibility, and a cost consciousness in the admini-

stration of his division. I rate hini an overall "Strong."

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT

McCORD, James W., Jr., Emp. Ser. No. 058124

Fitnesa Report

1. Thia in an annual fitnces report covering the period

1 April 1968 through 31 March 1969. During the firet period of

this report, Mr. McCord served as the Chief, Technical Division/

PTOS and continued to display a very high degree of professionaliam

in adminiatering the Agency's world-wide

_program. Undes his guidance, several new devices and

techniques were developed which have helped the Agency.and the

Intelligence community to maintain pace with the sophisticated

advances by the opposition in the field

2. Mr. McCord initiated the necessary planning for the

activation of the Interagency Training Center (ITC) which provides

Jinstruction to all members of the community in the Intest of

equipment and techniques.

3. On 14 October 1968, he was reassigned to the position

of Chief, Physical Security Division. Although he had relatively

little experience in this particular field, he has quickly assimilated

the necessary details to manage this Agency effort. He has taken

steps toward the development. and use of the most advanced

to protect the Agency. Under

the supervision of Mr. McCord, the Agency Security Command

Conter operations have been expanded and improved. He has been

assigned the rexponsibility to organize and direct the Security efforte

relating to the protection of Agency assets in time of demonstrations,

riots, and other civil disturbances.

He coordinated the Agency

Security effort with the U. S. Secret Service in protection of the

President of the United States during his recent visit to the ClA

Headquarters.

---

## Page 97

Mr. MiCord is considered to be economical in his use

of equipment, manpower and funds.

5. Perhaps one of the stronger attributes thie employee

pogecages is his ability lo organire. In a relatively short time.

he has deliberated the Physical Security Division's miasion and

already laken steps to restructure it within existing manpower

limitatione lo more effectively react to its responsibilities.

6. Ho inspires his subordinates and has the respect of his

superiors. There have been instances, however, when Ms. MrCord

has exhibited a certain intolerance with individuals who du rot auset

with his point of view, resulting in some friction in their working

relations.

There has been much improvement in this regard, and

I do not feel it will present any problem in the future.

7: I anticipate this employee will continue to absorb krri

ledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate

he has during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will

result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency. I rate

Mr. McCord a high "Strong."

necessity of his personnel to travel extensively throughout the world. Although

such duty carries with it numerous family problems, Mr. AcCord is able to

lichord was attending

Chief of the Technical Dielsdon/05 on 20 July 1965.

Eccord took hold of this Division with i hartening vigor and enthusdasn.

Althourn not

an Engineer, he

soon Icorned enough of the technical businase to

meet many crush

osslyments with

exceptional saill snd judgment.

By trytno to

get these assignments cone within set time latts, he sonetimes short circuited

a fer courdinations in other offices, but this did not serdously detract, in my

3. Comments of Revicwing Official

Jovaluation of Mr. McCord's

vigor and enthusiasm, skill and judgment. I would add to this that he

has demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity and leadership in supervising

the derciopment of several new and valuable techniques in the counter-

measures field. However, I vould rate him only "Proficient" in

Specific Duty Number 6, for I beliere that he has not been as effective

as he might be in liaison and coordination with other components of

the Intelligence Community represented on the Technical Committee.

This is unfortunate, for it detracts from his outstanding performance

in all other clements of his assigned responsibilities.

He must work

on irriproving these

relationships and he has been counseled to this

effect by his current supervisor.

CONCLUSIONS:

Ao It 1a our opinion that the possiblo compromises ariaing out of

this Inoident are relativoly minor in nature and that no major

compromises occurred.

Bo That the Suvlets "nosed" on the true nature of the flight and

personnel of the C-l18.

C.

That the reasons the crew mombers wore given an early release

were as follows.

1. Primarily, the Sovlet Interrogators failed to use all

of the leads at their commnd, particularly

addross book, and failed to break the crewmen through

Interrogation.

2

The crew did not inadvertently disclose through in

tarrogations, the purpose of their flight, 1ts rolation
