Fitness Report :

1. This is an annual fitnens report covering the period
1 April 1969 through 31 March 1970, Me, McCord completed
hia Ciret full year as Chief, Physical Security Division, During
1969 the Division underwent many changes, a direct result of the
Personal efforts of this employee. Ie has shown the initiative
fo seek out new ways and means to harden the security of our
domestic and overseas facilities by tapping all possible tech-
nological sources both in and out of Government, His efforts
have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture
in the physical security field iy far superior to any of our con=
temporaries,

2. With the spiraling costs of Tanpower, Mr. McCord
has concentrated on the potential for ues ne technical devices to
replace the human asset, He has made remarkable inroads into
this field by way of imagination, ingennity and drive,

<3: Mr. McCord has the quality w inspire his subordinates
He is demanding, but understanding. On mare than one occasion
he waa asked to take under his wing employcen who were labeled
"problems." Through personal interest and effort, he has salvaged
the majority oftheve individuate toa point where they are performing
in a highly satisfactory manner,

4. In the previous fimmess report, f alluded to the fact that
employee has a tendency to find it difficult to see another person's
Point of view, This, I feei, is attributable to‘an innate stubbornness
which obviously is difficult to overcome, Mr. McCord is a very



ao

principled individual who once convinced he haw hit upon the proper
course of action will usually yield only by direction, We've discussed
this, and I've noted a determined effort on his part to broaden his
tolerance for other opinions.

5. Overall, the employee has made a substantial contribution
to the Office of Security by his dedication to his job, his tenacious
attitude toward upgrading our physical security standards, a curious
and inventive mind ever searching for better waya to solve a problem
in his area of responsibility, and & cast consciousness in the admini-
stration of hia division. I rate hin an overall "Strong."

SUBJECT  McCORD, James W., Jr,, Emp. Ser. No. 056124
nése Report

1. This iean annual fitness report covering the period
1 April 1968 throvgh 31 March 1969, During the firm period of
this report, Mr. McCord served as the Chicf, Technical Division/

in administering the Agency's world-wide

Program. Under his guidance, several new devices and
techniques were developed which have helped the Agency and the
intelligence community to maintain pace with the sophisticated
advances by the-opposition.in the field

ia 2. Mr. McCord initiated the necessary planning for the
activation of the Interagency Training Center (TC) which provides
instruction to.all members of the community in the latest of
equipment and techniqu

3, On 14 October 1968, he was reassigned to the position
of Chief, Physical Security Division. Although he had relatively
little experience in this particular field, he hae quickly assimilated
the neceswary detaila to manage this Agency effort. He has taken
steps toward the development.and use of the most advanced|

G to protect the Agency, Under

© supervision of Mr, McCord, the Agency Security Command
Center operations have been expanded and.improved, He has been
assigned the reaponsibility to organize and direct the Security efforts
relating to the protection of Agency agscts in time of demonstrations,
riots, and other civil disturbances, Ile coordinated the Agency
Security effort with the U.S, Scerct Service in protection of the
President of the United States during his recent visit to the CIA
Headquarters,



grants
t.

4, Mr, McCord is considered to be economical in his use

of equipment, manpower and funds.

5, Perhaps one of the stronger attributes this employee
possceses is his ability lo organize. Ina relativ
he has deliberated the Physical Security Division
already taken steps to restructure it within existing manpower
limitations to more effectively react te its responsibilities,

6. He inspires hia subordinates and has the respect of his
superiors, There have been instances, however, when Mr. McCord
has exhibited a certain intolerance with individuals who do not agree
with his point of view, resulting in some friction in their working
relations, There has been much improvement in this regard, and
1 do not feel it will present any problem in the future.

7: anticipate this employee will continue to absorb knawe
ledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate
he hae during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will
result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency. I rate
Mr, McCord a high "Strong."

I concur thoroughly with evaluation of Mr, McCord's
vigor ard enthusiaam, skill and judgment. Iwoald add to this that he
has demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity and leadership in supervising
lopment of several new and valuable techniques in the counters
pcetares field. However, I would rate him only "Proficient" in
Specific Duty Number 6, for I believe that he has not been as effective
as he snight be in liaison and coordination with other components of
the Ieaclligence Community represented on the Technical Committee.
This ie unfortunate, for it detracts irom his outstanding performance
in all «ther elements of his assigned responsibilities. He must work
on improving these relationships and he has been counseled to thi

Tre plane, while en route to Teheran fron Nicosia and as a regult
of bad weather and navigation error, went off ite plotted coures cot
crossed into Soviet Armenia. There it was intercepted and fired on by
{nree MI0-17!s and caught fire in the left wing. Fivo of the erew bailed
gut and the other four rode the aircraft dom to a safe landing on a
small airstrip at Genfarzh in Soviet Azerbaijan, The crew mensers who
had renained on tke plane to ita landing got out safely and the plane
vas burning fiercely when tho crew last saw it, The part of the cree
{hat parachuted was surrounded by Soviet peasants, amo of whoa teat and
Struck at the crew members, One of the nen,

vas taken by the mob'to a telephone pole and narrowly escaped
hanging before being rescued by the Soviet military,

i [— pnd the remainder of the crew were turned over to the
Sovie tary, and after an overnizht atay in a Soviel military
garrison near Stepanaxert were taken to a city bolieved to be Yevlakh,.
and then flown to Baku, Russia. There they underwent interrogation by
Soviet intelligence officers, at least one of whom had served in the
United States, as a Soviet ‘Purchasing Commission employe 1943—45, and
later in Canada in 19L9-55 as First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy,
This RIS officer, Vladinir Bourdine, later served in 1955 as a personal
interpreter for Rirushchey in a meeting with Prime oter Nehru of
India. Bourdine interrogated Jat conaidereble
length during the pericd 20 dunes 3 July 1958, while the crew was in
Prisoned in the MD Headquarters building in Baku. Following their
individual interroratiors, the crow manters wore Tequired to appear
peparately before a Cormission of Soviet. officials at the Bakw iD
Keadquarters who questioned them about the bordor violation by the
Cell8 atreraft, and Tequested them to sim statements attesting that

Moose epotioned about either of the briefcases, their contente, nor

about the address took ard ita contents, We assume thst the Soviets

pave or vill process the naraa in the address book through thele Moscow

files | Som of the other crew ranbers carried personal notations in
their wallets relating to a few other CIA personnel.

We have received no:indicetions that or the other _
<rewmen were drugged or otherwiee tampered with by the Soviete
and some of the others did receive shots the firet night and second day
from the Soviet military for their wounda and burns; however, these
shots are believed to have been for legitimate medical reasons,

The substance of the questioning, treatment and techniques of
iRterropation has been ezhaustively explored with all the cre mrhere
in the courge of the detriefinze. In oumation, the interrogations
ef (he crew members were euperfictal and do not appear to have boos
packed up ‘by close coordination and communication with Moscow fox
jmelligence research purposes. It 1a poasible that the quick see
Inovledgment ty the Soviet Foretzn Office of tha landing of the Golld
in Soviet territory precluded tie HYD from fully exploiting the cron
embers, eee were ‘separated from the
group and given preferred treatment, epparently with the intention of
Geveloping then for information purposes. We are convinced that torn
Ren randled thenselves extrerely well and did not disclose any infor
mation conceming the Agency or its activities,

To date we have no indication that the Soviete knew at the tine
they interrogated the crew ven, that the flight of the C-118 wag cone
nected with CIA in eny.way, nor that they Imew,
Mere CIA peroonrel, we do believe that in time the Soviets, through
address books which liste the open Agency telephone msber ‘
EX 306115 below his name on the first page, will connect him and
possibly others in the address took with CIA. Since the Soviets
questioned him atout the 7170th Support Group and the 705th Support
Squadron in Wiesbaden, it io therefore presumed that they will ass0-
etate those units with this Agency,

other’ interested’ coiponents of thio Agency ac they are completed.
Questions wore solicited by tis Offico of all interested components,
in order to cover all matters in the dobriefings of interest to the

security will be maintained in the handling of information and reporte
derived from the debriefinga, and 90 that no compromise of the Agency
Anterest in tho flight of the C-118 will be made to the press.

CONCLUSIONS:
A. It is our opinion that the poseible compromises arising out of
this incident are relatively minor in nature and that no major
compromises occurred,

B, That the Soviets "mtosed" on the true nature of the fight and
personnel of the C-118,

€, That tho reasons the crew members wore given an early release
were as follows:

1, Primarily, the Soviet interrogators failed
of the leads at their command, particularly
addrosa book, and failed to break the crewmen through
interrogation.

2. The crew did not inadvertently disclose through ine
terrogations, the purpose of their flight, its relation
to the Agency and that of of its crew to ClA..

3. The Soviets apparently failed to check out the names
and other data in address book through their

files prior to release of the crew.

4. No incriminating information or material was immediately
recovered fram the burned aircraft,

5. Several of the crew destroyed incriminating building
passes and notations in Uwir wallets while on their
way down in their parachutes, or immediately after
landing in thetr chutes,

6. There were either no leaks or insufficient leaks of
incriminating information through any room conversa=
tions at Baku among the crew, which may have beon moni~
tored by the Soviets, or such conversations as there
may have been were not properly interpreted, or inter-
preted soon enough to tip the Soviets that there was
Soothing unusual, about the flight or tha crews,

9. A factor that protably had an important bearin; was the

early acknowledzzent by the Soviet Fcreign Office of
the downing of tie aircraft and the attempte by the
Soviets in the early stages to make this appear as a
deliberate violativn of the Soviet air frontier, This
tended to take 122 "play" avay fron the MVD and military

; intelligence. In aidition, this cevernment was stepping

, up the pressure fur the releage of the nine Army person=

: nel who landed in Bast Germany ina helicopter, and the -
Soviets probatly nad no desire to crwate a duplicate of
this incident.

10. Safeguards taken ty the Agency an! the Air Force were
such that there was no leak to the press, during the
crew's internment, of the fact that there was an in-
telligence connection of the flight am! crew of the

‘ call8,

D. That it is not believed, based on the evidence at hand, that
the crew was drugged or otherwise tampered with medically.

Z, That there are valuable points of guidese from a cover, opera-
tions, policy end code of conduct atanipvint which can
gathered irom experiences of thece crewmen in the hands of tho
Soviets and can aid the Agency and its cersonnel in any future
aituation of a similar nature in which the Soviet military and
RIS interrogators are encountered.

IN TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AGZUCY INTERZST

+ All possible steps were taken during the period immediately
preceding and immediately after the rélease of the crew to
effect the minima of publicity and to safeguard and linit

7 such publicity ag was given out, in omer to avoid disclos~

ing the CIA connection of the flight ani some of its crew.

B. Throughout the entire debriefing process in Germany and in
the U, S., the maxis care haa Leen taken to safeguard
the information taken by transcript an! classify it so that
there would be access to the informaticc therein on a need~
to-lmow basis and by only properly cleared persona.

Continue ‘to take all peesible steps to prevent any disclosure

flight,

Contime to take all possible steps to change the cover desig
nation of the. units appearing in address book to
prevent any further compromise of these units,

Permit no further publicity about the flight itself, in order
to minimize the possibility of the press learning of the CLA
interest in the flight of the C-118,;

Carefully follow all ratters relating to the International
Court of Justice interest in this flight, in order to prevent
any compromise of Agency interests,
