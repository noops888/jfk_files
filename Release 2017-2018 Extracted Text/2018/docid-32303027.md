ANTI- RACKETRERING”

Reference Havana letté Ss

ed May 27, 1858.

On July 21, 1958, PCI Artiur\ Newnan (conceal), Credit
Manager of the gambling casino at the Hotel Nacional, advised that
inquiry by him has failed to develop any information that the
MANNARINOS presently have any gambling interests in Cuba. Source
said that sometime ago SAM MANNARINO told him that he had lost a
large sum of money in Cuba in the, old Sans Souci Night Club operation
and.that he had no intention of ihvesting more money in gambling
eperations in Cuba in the near future. Seurce noted that in the
patt the MANNARINOS have shipped slot machines to Cuba. Source
believed that most of these shipments have beea through ALBERTO
ARDURA MOYA. Source noted that ARDURA is the “bag man" for
ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, the brother-in-law of Cuban President,
FULGENCIO BATISTA. Source said that since FERNANDEZ MIRANDA receives \
50% of the "take" from 211 slot machines operating in Cuba, ARDURA 4
usually is the individual to whom slot machines are experted from
the United States. Source said this is done by ARDURA te insure
control of the slot machines.

Havana sources have been instructed to be on the alert
for any Ki ation that ,the MANNARINOs have gambling interests
in Cuba 5)

Extra copies of this letter have been prepared for
forwarding ee the Bureau to the fas (92-228, 92-236)
