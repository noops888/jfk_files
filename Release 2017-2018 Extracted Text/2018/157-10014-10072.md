Intelligence Group where I began organizing the thing that is !
known now as the Contact Division. Tt 4s an organization to
develop intelligence from the American business community, set
Up & network so that we could see business people, university
People, travellers and so forth, and I wa engaged in that
Operation until 1951.

In 1951, I went to Germany and organized the Defector

Reception Center, the idea being that we would process People

who Were defecting from the Soviet Union and satellite
countries. And I then organized a group called the Returnee
Bxploitation Group dealing with Garman scientists who had heen

' taken by the Soviets to the Soviet Union after World War IT.

We would induce these people back from rast Germany, interroaatu
them for information on Soviet scientific and technical devel-

finished working on those Cuban matters and working generally
for Mr. Helms, can you recount just briefly what you did in
your remaining tour of tha Agency?

Well, let me see if I can summarize it for you.

You became the Executive Assistant to Admiral Rayburn
who was the DCI? :

Mr. McManus. Right.

After I finished the Cuban show, I went over and took over °
the cover staff, and then I went on to Rayburn's office.

Mr. Schwarz, As his Executive Assistant?

Mr. McManus. Right.

Mr. Schwarz. And after he left, what did you do hetore you

| retired?

Mr. McManus. Vice-Admiral Rufus Taylor came in as the
new Duputy, because Helms moved up to Rayburn's position, and
| 2 broke him in and left for Germany, and retired in May, 1979
in Germany.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, for questioning on the Cuban period.

You first cams into that in December, 19617

Mr. McManus. Right.

Mr. Schwarz. And you lastad in that until after the
MONGOOSE program terminated sometime in the fall of 1962,

Mr. McManus. fight.

Mr. Schwarz. All right.

‘What were you asked to do in December, 19617

Mr. McManus. I was asked to make = survey of what was
going on in the intelligence collection field in Cuba, and If
spent the Christmas week in Miami where we had our Cuban
station, and I looked into all of our clandestine activities,
the number of reports we received, and how many agents were
dispatched, what was being done about the flow of refugees
from Havana to Miami, I wrote this report and submitted it to
the authorities when I returned.

As a result of this report, I had recommended a very

i intensive effort in the interrogation of this flow of refugees
| because I felt thure ware a very qreat number of inteilectuals,
| well-informed people who were coming in.

Mr. Schwarz. And somathing called the pa-Lacka Center
was ultimately set up?

Mr. McManus. Well, this happened. Then I was told to
implement that, so I set up the thing called Opa-Lacka, yes,
the interrogation center.

Mr. Schwarz. All right.

Now, did you attend, in January, on January 19, a meetiny
with a number of people, including the Attorney General of the
United States coucerning Cuha?

Mr. McManus. Yes, I did. In his office, in the Attorney
Genaral's office.

Mr. Schwarz. Would you put in front of the witness, and

Mr. McManus. It is indeed, yes. |

ME. Schwarz. And the type:

of your handwritten notes?
Mr. McManus. With some mistakes in it.

Mr. Schwarz. Some-typographical mistak:

Mr. McManus. For example, “not” instead of "now" changes
the paragraph 2 in the beginning, changes the meaning complete- -
ly. ‘

Mr. Schwarz. Which word is that?

Mr. McManus. Paragraph 2 of the typed memo, third line
2, “would not attack the Cuban problem," “would now" --

Mr. Schwarz. Okay, yes.

In addition to the attendees who are shown on page 1,
Mr. Helms attended, is that right?

Mr. McManus. Yes.

Actually, I wrote this memoranda for Helms' signature.
Apparently the original is not here with his signature, so the
Il there is Richard Helms.

Mr. Schwarz. Now on the second page of the typad vuernion
at subparagraph a, there is 4 paragraph which reads as follows:

' "Accordingly, a solution to the Cuban problem today carried”

Now, who is that quoting? Whose words are those that you
quoted?

Mr, McManus. Those are the words of Robert Kennedy, the
‘ Attorney General.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you understand those words to include
permission to assassinate Fidel Castro or have anything to do
with assassination?

Mr. McManus. I didnot. It never occurred to me.

Mr. Schwarz. Would you characterize Mr. Kennedy, if you

| were taking a sports analogy, would you characterize hk
H
what his demeanor was like in that meating?

Mr. McManus. Well, there was not any question that he

had called this group together and he really wanted action.

In other words, there was no question. He was very vehement in

his speech. He said, we're going to get moving here, he said

we have got to be underway. And he was really putting the
pressure and heat on. And that came through to me vary clearly
and I am sure to everyone else in the room, and there wasn't
eny question that if there was anv problem, all you had to do
was qive him a’ring and he would see that vou got results

I think that is somewhere in the notes here that 1 did
not put in the finishad material, you know.

Mr. Schwarz. All right.

Mr. McManus, Absolutely not. I never thought of that.
T had no idea that that was contemplated.

‘Mr. Schwarz. Okay.

Now, following this meating, did Mr. Helms ask you to play.
4 rola with respect to monitoring or following the progress of
the task force and Mr. Harvey?

Mr. McManus, I was an assistant and dealt solely with

Cuban matters.
Mr. Schwarz, Assistant to whom?
Mr. McManus. To Helms,

Mr. Schwarz. To Helms. ay

Mr. McManus. But I waé primarily interested in intelli-

heart of the matter. That interested ms more than any other
aspect of the show.

I did write a weekly report --

It was printed up, perhaps the SCI signed it. -I don't

White House, SECDEF, State, Attorney General, the Bureau, ‘I
guess, in which I would summarize the highlights of intelligence
gathered during the past week, and i° then I had an operational
summary of what had been done operationally during that week.

Mr. Schwarz. And that you obtained from Mr. Harvey, did
you?

Mr. McManus. The operational?

Mr. Schwarz. Yas.

Mr. McManus. I would ask Harvey to supply that information
to me. Harvey would give me the information, I would adit it
and out it would go.

Mr. Schwarz. So was Nr. Helms looking to you as his
principal staff assistant on Cuba ‘to keap generally on top of
what was going on in the Cuban operations for him?

Mr. McManus. Partially, yes. I would say I was assistinc

him, particularly in the intelligence field and keeping the

| community aware of what ,prograss. wa were making in intelliaenc-

gathering and operations, and I followed all of tha traffic en

| Cuba.

Mr. Schwarz, You ware spending, in a sense, your full
time on Cuba, weren't you?

Mr. Schwarz. And Mr. Harvey was snending his full time on

Mr. McManus. Ha was the operational head of the task
force who was responsible to General Lanedale.

Mr. Schwarz. Your understanding was that Harvey's boss,
Harvey's reporting channel, was to Lansdale to get tasks from
Lansdale?

_ Mx. McManus. Yes, Lansdale gave him tasks, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And he: gave him constantly changing and
new and different and confusing taske?

Mr. McManus. Yas,

Mr. Schwarz. You are smiling. ‘The record ought to show

what your smile is intended to convey.

“Mr. McManus. Well, fd Lansdale had bean picked by the

i Attorney General as tha man in charge, you see. I am sure
Lansdale assumed as soon as a task force had been set up in the

Central Intelligence Agsncy that this was his private sort of

| Army, that he could task his battalion commander to do this,

* and he would send him another task, and he'd retreat, advance,
go sideways, and as time went on, there were fantastic things
that came in, do this, do that, write a paper on this, what
about the possibility of balloons, and all sorts of Proposan‘!.:
ideas, papers would have to be written, just dozens of oceonle

‘ working’ flat out to mast these requirements.

And so therefora, you sea, these tasks were coming from a:
individual outside directly into a small task force within the

| Central Intelligence Aqency.

TOP SECRET



410 Fest Street SE, Wasminatenn, B.C 20007

Mr. Schwarg. By the individual, you mean Lansdale?

Mr. McManus. From Lansdale to a task force that was. set
up under Bill Harvey, and Bill Harvey wasn't really even part
of the clandestine service. In other words, herews' Helms,
the Deputy Director of Plans, Candestine, and here is Mr. John
McCone up here as the Director. $0 all of this was going right
down into an organization, back and forth, couriers going,
meetings being held. It was odd organizationally.

Mr. Schwarz. It was odd organizationally?

Mr, McManus. Yes.

Mr. pay And perhaps odd from the point of view of
the personalities involved as well?

Mr. McManus. Rather, yes, rather.

Mr. Schwarz. We have seen some of that.

Now you were spending full time on Cuba and Mr. Harvey was

spending full time on Cuba. What proportion of Mr. Helms’
time went into Cuba?

Mr. McManus. I would say very little, as a matter of
fact, except for responding to questions from around town an‘
what the proqress was, and what do you think the future hols.
Otharwise, he was rather removed from it. I mean, he had the
whole world to supervise from the clandestine point of view.

Mr. Sehwarz, And you said something interesting that !

“ hadn't understood befora or heard before, You said Mr. Harvey

was not really a part of the clandestine services. What did vs

mean by that? : |

Mr. McManus. Well, organizationally, if you look at the i
clandestine service, you have divisions and you have staffs, :
and he was not in a division and he was not in a staff. A
special force, a task force, had been set up, so that organiza-
tionally he was the man nominally over them, and he was
receiving his orders, not from someone in the hierarchy, but
he was receiving them from a man outside of the organization
who had been picked by the Attorney General to be the commander
of ‘this effort.

Mr. Schwarz. In other words, Lansdale.

Mr. McManus, Ed Lansdale, General Lansdale.

Mr. Schwarz. Okay.

Now, did you, after the Cuban Missile Crisis had been deals|
with and MONGOOSE was coming to an end, did you write a
memorandum about MONGOOSE, looking back over it and saying whe?
lessons we can learn, and so. forth?

Mr. McManus. Yes, I did.

Mr. Schwarz. And who asked you to write that memo?

Mr. McManus. 1 don't think I was asked to write this

" piece of paper. I was talking to Helms ahout problems that 1

| could foresee in the future, and we were discussing this, and

I said, you know, I ought to sit down and put this on a Diace
of paper. It would be much better if I would out it on a niece

of paper. So I just wrote a think piece. I didn't address it

TOP SECRET



to anyone, I just wrote a plece of paper. |

Mr. Schwarz. Okay. Let's put in front of you as McManus |
Exhibit 3, a three-page memorandum with your signature at the
end dated Novamber 5, 1962, with some handwriting on the front
page, and stamped at the bottom 01110 to 01112.

Is that the memorandum we were just talking about, Mr.
McManus?

Mr. McManus. Yes, that is the paper. That is the little

think piece I wrote. .

Mr. Schwarz. And you gave that after you wrote it, and
you have recounted the conversation you had with Mr. Helms.
Did you give it to Mr. Helms?

Mr. McManus. TI gave it to him.- This is what I think,

Mc. Schwarz. And is it your understanding he then
dt forth, sent it out to Mr. McCone, the DCI? ,

Mr. McManus. I think he either took it up to Marshall

what ha intended to do after he read it.*

Mr. Schwarz. But you don't know that one way or the
i other, that is Just your imprasaton?

Mr. McManus. I don't think Mr. McCone was there on the

Marshall Carter.

Mr. Schwarz, All right.

Did Mr. Halms make any comments to you about the substance
of the memo?

Mr. McManus. No, he did-not. He just thought I had some
interesting ideas in here, and there are some fairly sharp
comments, but I seid that was my honest opinion, and I was

} also: making recommandations here about organization’, which 1
felt was very important.

Mr. Schwarz, All vight.

Now, part of the memorandum deals with your understandin-

NW 50955 DocIa:

of what happened, or what
program?

Mr. MeManaz. Bight.

Mr. Schwarz. Let me read to-you the first sentence of
Paragraph 4, “During the past year while one of the options of
the project was to create internal dissension and resistance
leading to eventual .S. intervention, a review shows that
policy makers not only shied away from the military intervention
aspect but,were generally apprehensive of sabotage proposals.”

First question. Who did you mean by policy makers there?

Mr. McManus. I think when some aspects of MONGOOSF began
to be reviewed at a higher level, you know, all the wav to
Bundy and across that level --

Mr. Schwarz. Maxwell Taylor?

Mr. McManus. Yeah, that's right.

Mr. Schwarz. Robert Kennedy?

Mr. McManus. They felt that 4ONGOOSF, vou know, the
intefnal dissension and all is fins, but we're not qoina to
commit any forces to invade Cuba, and ths other agnect was
that they didn't even like the idea of a lot of sabotaas,
because there were so many Cubans, for examnle, even in Florit
and here we had a big Strategic Air Command base down south ¢

Miami, I mgan, there could he all sorts of retaliation problems.

So generally the feeling was, we are going to qo short of any

Scrious consideration of military intervention, and thev were

TOP SECRET

32423460 Page 20


not very keen on sabotage operations.

Mr. Schwarz, I interrupted your anawer to try to see who |
you meant by the policy makers. You said persons on the level,
I think, of Bundy.

Mr. McManus. Wall, I've got, to be careful in saying, I'm
not -- it ia difficult for me to nama, but I would say certainly
psople who were concerned with these matters, the senior. peopla
in, government.

Mr. Schwarz. The senior people in government who were

concerned with these matters, who included Maxwell Taylor,

' McGeorge Bundy, Robert Kennedy, McNamara -~
Mr. McManus. All of those people, but I go on to say here,

it was only Taylor -- if you could read the next. sentence --

Mr. Schwarz, WYes. Will you read the next sentence into
the record and explain what you meant by that?
Mr. McManus. Yes. I say, “The only senior official
involved outside of the Agency who thought in terms of military
: action was Maxwell Taylor."

Mr. Schwarz. I quess that, speaks in terms sufficiently

for itself.

McManus. That's right.

1.6, Waningten, 0.6. 20001

Mr. Schwarz. What did you mean by the sentence that

follows that? Maybe you cculd read that into the record an?
explain what you meant by it.

Mr. McManus. [t is difficult for me to put myself back ‘hat

many years, but I think at the time I had reached the conclusion,

you know, after the Missile Crisis was all over and i looked back

on it, I felt that a tremendous amount of the activity that had

| been carried on, intensive activity of all kinds, was really

almost game~playing, you know, it really wasn't that serious.

I mean, if you look back in the pertod, you will find that
a lot of people were criticizing the government for inaction in
Cuba, not doing something, not sending the Army.in there, not
doing all these kinds of things. So Lansdale and his group
Were active as hell in getting, you know, keeping a frothy
operation going all the time. You know, there were things in
the paper about Cubans doing this, and we were trying to do that
about Cuba. Actually, not very much was accomplished.

What I.was worried about, on the intelligence side, was
the Soviet build-up which was coming to me through intelliaence

which is claar as a bell that this build-up was qradually

| getting more intense, the Soviet presence was increasing, and

this was what -- you see, it wasn't this flaw. It was those
Ruskies who were ‘coming in there and solidifying their
position while we were carrying on all thesa balloon operatiu::
and Lord knows what.

Mr. Schwarz, And the froth, as you dascribed, that is
your characterizatior, of the MONGOOSF proram?

Mr. McManus. I would say that is what I thought at the

time I wrote this. I think that was what was going through 7

head. This was my honest opinion.

Mr. Schwarz. Based upon your review of the project over
the months you were associated with it?

Mr. McManus. That is right.

Mr. Schwarz. Thank you.

Senator Tower. (presiding). Are you through?

Mr. Schwarz. Yes. .

Senator Tower. Mr. McManus, in this think piece that: you

did that we have been referring to.--

Mr. McManus. Yes, Senator. :

Senator Tower. On page 3, the top of tha page, "Practically
everyone at the operating level agrees that Lansdale has lost

his value. Bundy and Taylor are not impressed with him. pili

:

Quinn and company obviously have his number, ag do we.”
What was General Quinn's job? This is the only document
I've seen or looked at closely in which Bill Quinn's name
* surfaces.
Mr. McManus. I believe General Quinn at the time, to the
best of my recollection, was then running the Defense Intell:

geace Aqency. Bill Quinn had been in OSS and had been wi

hn
the CIG many years aqo and SSU. I know Bill Quinn auite well,
and I think he was in tha Nafanse Intelligence Aqancy, or --

T cannot remambar what ths organization was at that tima,

he was the boss, Senator.

AiO argh

Senator Tower, I sue. So he was not necessarily dire:

involved in this Lansdale operation?

Mr. McManus. Oh, no, air, not at all, no. But I felt
that over there in the Defense Department there w. other
People who shared the view that we had, I mean there were some
other senior people in tha Department of Defense, Bill Quinn
being a man I had greatly respected and had worked for at one
time when I was a younger man.

Senator Tower. So actually what was happening was that
Lansdale was, in effect, through back channels, tasking Harvey .

directly, is that right, but no reference to this paper.

Mr. McManus. What. was that, sir? Excuse me?
Senator Tower. Was Lansdale, through back channels, or
| at least without going through the normal chain of command,

was directly tasking Harvay, is that correct?

Mr. McManus. This was the way it was set up and it was

| authorized. I maan, he wasn't cutting through any hierarchy
that he wasn't supposed to. This was set up that way. It was
a most unusual organizational. set up, but that was because the

Attorney General was running the thing, and this was the way
he wanted it. le wanted Lansdale as his man to be in charqe, te
run herd over this group, and that is what he did. He ran her?

over the group.

in the Miami area.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Since you were involved, at
least to some degree, on Mr. Helms' behalf in this whole
Cuban operation iad

Mr. McManus. Yes, sir.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Were there ever Washington

meetings of Task Force W where these 200, roughly 200 people
would get together and Harvey would lecture them, or anything
like that?

Me. McManus. I know that Harvey would hold staff meetina=

of the senior people.

Senator Hart of Colorado. And that would be about how
| many people?

Mr. McManus. I would say five or six, probably.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Did you attend any of those
meetings?

Mr. McManus. I never attended any of those meetings, m9.

Senator Hart of Colorado. To your knowledge, did the
Attorney General ever pick up the phone and call directly int»

i Mr, Harvey or any of the sunior peonle in Task Force W?

Mr. McManus. I really have no knowledge as to whather ar

did or not.

Senator Hart of Colorado. But you don't recollect Harvey

ever saying to you, I just talked with the Attorney General,
or anything like that?

Mr. McManus. No, I don't. No, I do not.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Would Mr. Helms ever have
attended any of these senior staff maatings?

Mr. McManus. No, no sir.

Senator Hart of Colorado. But to pursue Senator Tower's
question, the link between General Lansdale and Mr. Harvey was

an institutional one? It was established that way?

Mr. McManus. Correct, that's correct.

Senator Hart of Colorado. It was Taylor to Lansdale to

Harvey?

Mr. McManus. That's right, that's right.

Senator Hart of Colorado. In MONGOOSE.
And what role did Mr. Hulms play in that link?
Mr. McManus. He really wasn't involved in that link
directly. He was much off to the side, because was really ar
employee of Mr. Helms. Mr. Helms was his senior officer, but
again, on the other hand, he was takina his direction from
someone outside the orqanization.

Now I think you spoke, Senator, about Tayloy, Lansdale,

et cetera, as I remember it, it was more the Attorney General,
Lansdale. I think Lansdale had a very sort of close relation-

' that out somewhere hera.

Mr. Schwarz. At the bottom of Page 2 --

Mr. McManus. Yes, I see.

Soma people sort of thought he was a mystic, you know.
Senator Hart of Colorado. How did you gather this relation-
between Lansdale and the Attorney General?

Was thia representations that Lansdale made to you?

Mr. McManus. Well, my first impreasion I had in this

ting in the Attorney General's office, you know, you just

Sense people, that there's sort of a relationship, you know,

there's a special relationship of some kind.
And I could feel that, Jeez, almost in the air, as far

as the Attornay General and Lansdale, and I knew that Lansdale:

wane a rau

,' after hours and all, I knew from him, he would spend quite a

14

bit of time with the Attorney General, so I knew there was more

just a relationship of a general officer in the Pentagon and
the Attorney General. There was a close personal relationship
in. which Lansdale had, I would say, a lot of influence, some
sort of influences.

That's why I say when some of thase -- that's why I sav
when some of these people thought he was a mystic, perhaps [

don't gat my point over to you, you know, but that. is what I

thought. That is why T put it in there. I just wrote down whet:

Mr. McManus. Sure, yes, sir.

Mr. McManus. No, I never attended any of those, Senator.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Did you ever hear any discussions

‘ir. McManus. I'm not quite sure I understand that question,
Senator,

Could he have discussed it?

Senator Hart of Colorado. Could he and his senior Task
Force W people have been planning this or discussing it withous
you finding out?

Mr. McManus. Oh, I think that was -- yes, he could, if

that was what he wished to do, but knowing Harvey, I don't

think he would have discussed it with verv many people. 1

what he has in the kack of his mind.

Mr. McManus. I do not think ‘he would discuss it.

Senator Hart.of Colorado. You said five or six people.

Mr. McManus. I don't think he would discuss it with one
of them. No, I don't think he would discuss it with them.

This is what I would call a need to know, a one man need to

no.

ator Hart of Colorado., Are you saying it's impossible
| for five or six people in the Agency to plan assassinations

without it gatting out?

Mr. McManus. No, what I'm driving at, Senator, is that 1

j don't think that if he was planning assassinatnion, he would

not have that many people involved in his staff. te might

have a special little inside group who probably wouldn't know

them. orders to do something, and they would carry out the
order. They wouldn't know what the end result would be.
: Senator Hart of Colorado, And that could be done amonq
those few special people without others finding it out?
Mr. McManus. -I suppose so. I'm just thinking in my
ordinary life, I ask people to do things without their
knowing why or what my motive is, you know?

You could utilize individuals.

Senator Tower. Let me pursua Senator Hart's question

just a step further.

Was it standard operating procedure within the Agency to
compartmentalize to the extent that very often people did not
specifically why they ware doing certain things? Perhaps one
Person knew or four different people were doing something, but
those four had no knowledge of how it all fit together?

Mr. McManus. I think that could be said on a need to know
basis, Senator Tower, that very often that something very
sensitive was going on, that people would have to carry out
certain orders without really knowing the honest reason for

it, you sus, what the objective was.

Senator Tower. During the course of your career in the Cry

working group which Mr. Harvey represented CIA, and that it
was the view of the Agency that Lansdale’s charter allowed him
to task Harvey direct? i

Mr. McManus. Wall, there wasn't any question in my mind

that Lansdale was able to charge the task force with whatever

he wanted them to do. In other words, Lansdale was a General

without an Army, if you took Task, Force W away. When you out

in Task Force W, that was his Army, and Harvey happened to he,
if you call hima battalion commander or whatever he was, thet
was it. And Lansdale gave the orders.

Mr. Smothers. Okay.

In the normal --

Mr. McManus. Excuse me. I must except insofar as th

organization and the task, forca would be running in a normal

way a lot of clandestine operations, putting people ashore in

boats and so forth, you know, a continuing standard: clandesti..4

Mr. Smothers. Then in order to task Yarvay, it would nc*
have been necessary for Lansdale to go through the DCI or
through iielms?

Mr. McManus. No. Ne -- as I remember it, sir, there we:

Mr. Smothers. Let me then draw on your .general experienc
years of experience with the Agency and your familiarity with
both the mathod of operation of Helms, DCI and the other
principals at this tima, to raise a few hypothetical questions
with you, if I might.

One, let us assume that Mr. Harvey had, in fact, been

tasked by General Lansdale to develop assassination plans.

Is it your opinion that this. information would have been shared |

with Mr. Helms by Harvey, and he would have gona to Helms and
said, this is what they've asked ma to do, should I do it?

Mc. McManus. Well, I really cannot answer that.

Mr. Smothers. Based on the operating procedure at this
time, as you knew it?

Mr. McManus. ‘That would be difficult for ma to answer
that question, really. [ really don't think I can answer that
or give you a reasonable answer.

Mr. Smothers. Let's trv it this way, then.

Do you believe that Mr. Harvey would take stens to cerry
out an assassination without informing Mr. Helms?

Mr. McManus. I really cannot answer for Harvey, but |
think he would be 4 damned fool if he didn't.

Mr. Smothers. Okay.

Let me focus, then, on the relationshin betwean Mr. tele
and the Director, Mr. McCone, as you knew it.

Is it your opinion that Mr. Helms kant Mr. McCone full-

TOP SECRET



informed of the DDP activities?

Mr, McManus. I always assumed so when I was --

Mr. Smothers. Well, you noted here that your presance at
the January 19th meeting was for the Purpose of making notes
so that the Director could be kept informed by Mr. Helms.

Was that the normal course of activity?

Mr. McManus. The reason I went along with Helms was that
T had already written a report about our current activities,

| what had to be done, to improve the intelliqence gathering, ard

, | the Attorney General apparently was aware that this was done
| ao 1 want alona to represent. this new idea of intelligence
gathering. On the way over, Helms said, you'd better take

1 some notes, 1 said, fine, I'll take the notes. So I wrote un

this memo of the meating, and as soon as we got back, I had

j it drawn up --
|

Mr. Smothers. You wrote the memo for Helms’ signature,
didn't you?
Mr. McManus. That's right, s0 he could take it to Mr.
AeCone immediately.
Mr. Smothers. Was this consistant with flelms' normal
Method of operation?

Mr. McManus. As I remamber it, yes. I always thought

1. 5 E.. Wasminaton, 0.6, 200 8

that he informed the Director. [ always tried to keep the
Director informed,

Mr. Smothers. Realizing again that wa are in a hypothetisal

TOP SECRET



situation, and assume that there is, aa there has been some
testimony to indicate, a conversation between Mr. Harvey and
Mr. Helms regarding the question of assassination, and the
implementation of assassination schemes, would it be your
opinion that after determining an assassination scheme should
be implemented, that Mr. Harvey and Mr. Helms would agrea not
to inform Mr. McCone?

Mr. McManus. As I said, T always assumed that Mr. Helms
would kesp the Pirector fully informed:of any activity that
he thought was sensitive or should be brought to his attention,
you know, any sensitive activity, any information that was
developed that was important, as you would in any good oraani*-~

tion, disciplined organization. I mean, I just assumed that

any man in that position would keep the Nirector, who has

the responsibilities that he doms in this qovernment, fully

informed. I mean, I would just assume that.

Thare is only one reason that I think he miqht not that It

can think of, and that would be if someone told him not to tel!
him.

Mr. Smothers. If somsone told him not to tell the
Director?

Mr. McManus. T€ somaons told him, now look, I don't wa
you to bring John McCone into that. Who that someone is, I
don't know, but it occurred to ma that this could happen.

Mr. Smothers. In your opinion, is that the only ‘circ:

TOP SECRET

2423460


ALO Fst Street, $6, Wasminaton, 8.6, 20008

in which Mr. Helms would not inform the Director?

Mr. McManus. In my opinion, yes. Yes, sir, that is my

“opinion.

Mr. Smothers. All right.

As you knew the Operation MONGOOSP Cuba situation, who
would be in a position to advise Mr. Helms not to inform Mr.

McCone?

Mr. McManus. TI don't know. I really honestly don't know,

but -- .
“Mr. Schwarz. I thought he was going to finish his
answer.

Nx. McManus. I was searching my mind for why he wouldn'+
inform Mr. McCone. I can't think of any reason for not inform
ing Mr. McCone unless someone whom he thought was higher
authority told him not to. Now, Mr. McCone is one of the
finest Directors I ever knew. He was a broad-gauged, sincere
morally strong individual, and I think that if a matter of
that kind had been brought to his attention, he would have
reacted violantly immediately, and Mr. McCone had a qreat
love for the President 0% the United Stites, and he sort of
looked at him in a way as an older son or a brother, a very
protactive sense he had about the President, President Ke
and McCone would have immediately said, Jesus, this is a nu-w:
ballgame, number 1. Secondly, as an individual, he would ha

found it morally reprehensible, sea, So I think that thet

TOP SECRET



about summarizes my thinking on this.
Mr. Smothers. Let me understand this, then.
Under most circumstances, and indeed, under all circum-

imaging, Nelms would have told “cCone, with

exception of a situation in which Helms had been told by
higher authority not to téll him.

Are we correct that far? Is that a corract statement, or
a correct summary of what you have said?

Mr. McManus. Let me just repeat, if I may, what I said.

I said the only reason I could think of that he would not

inform him ia that someone instructed him not to. Obviously,

it would be someone more senior {n gqvernment, someone whom he
felt he ought to obey his orders, and who that is, I don't

know.

Smothers. Well, understanding Ganeral Lansdale's
position now as coordinator, his ability to task the CIA, end
understand “ir. Harvey's position and his relationship to “r.
Helms, is it your opinion, even if Nr. Helms had received a
very claar directive with regjarc to assassination from Genera!
Lansdale or anyone on'that level, anyone on the level below
higher authority, or below the Cabinet lavel, that Mr. Nelrs

would have considered that sufficisnt hasis to proceed with ths

execution of an assassination scheme?

Mr. Smothers. Well, didn't Mr. Helms have access, regular

, Bubstantially higher than General Lansdale?

Mr. McManus. Well, I mean, Mr. Helms used to go over to

all the time, you know. Ha was always in and around the White

House.

Mr. Smothers. Well, do you think he would have taken

General Lansdale's order to assassinate Pidel Castro without

‘ checking it out, without seeing if Lansdale was correct?

Mr. McManus. Do I think that he would taka Lansdale's

'" order? No, I don't think he would take Lansdale's order to

assassinate Castro, no. That's my opinion. No, I definitélv
don't think he would have.

Mr. Smothers. Understand now, we are qoing on your
understanding of the way things overated at this time, as well
4s the operation of thg Agency.

All right, let's look at ‘Ir. Helms’ contacts, then.

Did he meet regularly with the President?

Mr. McManus. Did he meet with the President? Yes, he
Met with the President a lot. I've been in the office
when the President would call him on the phone and say,

Dick, what the hell's the story on this, I'm qatting some
boilurplate from some other Devartmants., And we would look
into it and report to him precisely, immediately.

Mr. Smothurs. These reportinas to the President, did th

gomstimes occur on Mr. ifalms' initiative, or did he wait for

TOP SECRET



Steet St masnineton, OC 20001

NW 50955 DocId:32423460

ident to call him?
Mr. McManus. I-think he usually waited for the President

to call him. I remember one amusing incident when we had

i picked up some machine guns and I think it was the coast of

Venezuela, when Castro had landed there, when he was interested
in stirring up trouble in the southern Hemisphere, and someone
jeent one of these guns up to Headquarters and Helms was going
lover to see the Attorney General that day and he put the gun
in a little box he had thera and took it over and showed the
Attorney General, and I think the Attorney General called the
President and said I'm going to take Helma over to see you,
he's got a piece of equipment he wants to show you. I think
you'd like to see it.

So they all knew Helms there, the Secret Service and all,
you know, and, Christ, he walks right into the White House with
this thing and into the President's office, and the President
took him and put it up, you know, aimed around in the office
and said, Jesus, he said, Dick, you know, it's a good thing
you're 4 loyal subject

So, this is the relationshin. I'm just trying to qive
you the relationship thara. Tt was a close relationship
between the President and Richard Helms.

“ur. Smothsrs. Would you describe the relationship betwe-
Mr. ilelma and Kobert Kennedy?

that much about it. I was never present at any other meetings.
I don't know what the relationship wa

Mr. Smothers. All right.

Let's raise a question regarding some other actors
involved here.

You have indicated in your memo that the opinion of Genera}
Lansdale was not terribly high in the Agency, and you seem.to
infer that he was simply tolerated by other persons based on tha
fact that the Prdsident, or the President and the Attorney
General, had laid the mantle on General Lansdale for the
purposs of heading up the working group on Cuba operations.

Mr. McManus. Yes.

Mr. Smothers. You mentioned as one of the persons who

was trying going along, Mr. Gilpatric who was then the Deputy

Secretary of Defsnss. What was your understanding of Mr.

I
' Gilpatric's involvement in the Cuba opsations?

Mr. McManus. I cannot answer that, but I just -- at the
time -- it is hard for me to recollect, but somehow or other

just within the Agency. Excuse me. You see, it wasn't just
within the Agency, and the: weason I was making thi recommenda-|
tions is that I wanted to protect our own organization.

Mr. Smothers. low wall did you come to know the wild man,
General Lansdale?

Mr. McManus. Well, I mat him on the day I went over to that
meeting, and I used to sea him from time to time, and people
from the task force would come up to me and say we have this

Paper from Lansdale. I don't know what the hell to do. And

T'1l say, well, I'11 give you a hand, I'll help you write it,

| write a report for him,

Mr. Smothers. In your opinion, was General Lansdale doin:

things inconsistent with the desires of the Attorney General?

Mr. McManus. I cannot answer that question. I do not
know.

Mr. Smothers. Well, you mentioned your observation of
the relationship between them, and you mentioned the fact that
the Attorney General was apparently pleased with General Lans-
dale.

“ir. McManus. I don't know how pleased he was latar on,

Mr. Smothers. To tha bast of your knowledge, were any

of Lansdale's wild schemes or pokey schemes, as you described

them, ever specifically called off and pulled back by the
Attorney General?

Mr. McManus. You see, I would not know about that.

Mr. Smothers. Well, you apparently formed some opinion,
though, about the amount of backing Lansdale enjoyed at the
tims of this memo, at the time of your think piece, and if we

could go back to that time, is it your recollection at the

time of this think pisce that General Lansdale still enjoyed

the confidence of the Attorney General?

Mr. McManus. Wel}, I think IT say in paragraph 9 on the
bottom of page 2, “Absolutely no attempt on our part should be
made to unseat Lansdale. Remember that the Attorney General was

fighting Lanasdale's battle as recently as two weeks aqo.”

So that, I mean, obviously I felt that there wasn't a thing
we could do about Lansdale, but organizationally, we could
protect a lot of our veople from his deprecations.

Mr. Smothers. Now this think piece is in November. Your
first DeLana to Lensdale is in January of 1962.

Mr. McManus. That's right, yes, sir

Mr. Smothers. Based on your recollection of the times,
and the state of mind or the conclusions that you apparent!

With respect to interrogating the back log of Cubans we agreed that.
we would attack this problem by getting at the more recent arrivals
first and work toward those who have been here longer. It was made
clear to the Attorney General that one could not relate in time the
establishment of an interrogation facility with placing agents to live
in Cuba -- inother words a body of information would have to be
developed over a period of intensive interrogation of many sources.

4. It was General Lansdales view that there were scveral tasks
amongst the #32 outlined upon which action could be taken without
waiting this detailed intelligence information. He noted for example--
the defection of top Cubans as being within the capabilities of the CIA.

1, When the President, in his letter to
gave “assurances against invasion of Cuba: ia consideration of thes”
Soviet rsmoval of offensive weapons in Cuba under UN supervision,”
Operation Mongoose was onits death bed, When the President stated
in his letrer of 23 Octovar to Khrushckev, "I consider my letter to
you of 27 October aad your reply of today as a firm undertaiéag.on
the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried

the agreements are not carzied out, military action cannot long be

3. Looking back to the origina of Mongoose one finds the
Attorney General sad Mz, McNamara seekiag primarily to semove
the political stain left on the President by the Bay of Pigs failure.
Both the A.G. and the Secretary of Defense felt it necessary for
political rsasens that some action HaWGS be taken with respect to
Cuba to insure the President's future, Ina nutvaell, they wero out

4. During the past year, while onw of the options of the project
was to cream isteraal dissension and resistances leading to eventual

svention, a review shows that policymakers not nly shied
away from the military intervention aspect Sut were geaeraliy appre-
hensive of sabotage proposals. The only 3e¢ official iavolved,
outside the Ageacy, who thought in terms of reilitary action was
Maxwell Taylor, Others lcs the Attorney-General, McNamara,
Gitparric, Jeanson and later Bundy viewed the project in a ptrictly

6 Given these circumstances and in the light of great pressures
elsewaore in the world CLA, iateraally, should move with great
rapidity to distance Taax Forca W from any external access, This
would involve regularizing or institesionalizing TFW in order that
this unique group whic bas been available to Lansdalu ay a “whippiag
boy''becomes a normal part of our monolithic Agency structure, By
such amovo, neither Lansdale nor anyona else could get at these
resources without going through regular channels. Within CLA we
would reraza Cuba to the Western Hemisphere and treat Cuba as a
denied areca and relate it to over-all WH problams. ( oughout
Project Mongoose, this is precisely the manner in which State bas
handled the problem, As a result Lansdale never felt that he had
troops in State as he did in CLA.)

7. ln accomplishing this, the only analogy I cas thine of is a
Corporate one. We should not go through bankruptcy which would
have to be announced, but rather pasa TFW through an unpublicized
