COUMUUATION OF

Olsrarcn osun - 276227
. Subject is President or Director of the I
Nourophysiology institute (formerly Higher Nervous

Activity Institute), Academy of Sciences: subsource
thinks that Subject is also Professor of Medical
Psychology at Havana University. Subject is a very
well trained psychiatrist and has always enjoyed
great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always
been reputed to have very low morals, and in medical
circles is "famous" as a woman chaser. fle is widely
reputed to attempt to seduce his female patients and
his colleagues' wives. Major Bernabe ORDAZ ,
Director of Havana Psychiatric Hospital, considers
Subject to’ be a vulgar political schemgr utterly
lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new"
Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers that
Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice
for his ovn personal benefit.

c. When Castro took power, Subject surprisingly
abandoned the Immediate Action medical doctors! party
and joined the recently organized Revolutionary Medical
Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960.

In medical circles, Subject is reputed to collaborate
with the DSE in brain-washing activities, but subsource
had never seen any direct indications of such +

collaboration,
7 a AND NEN eet

a. /Drf ‘Armando *DE CORDOVA , -Psychiatrist“
employed a¢ a professor at Havana University, is
a good psychiatrist about 70 years old who has always
been.a leftist but is not the type of immoral person
that Bustamante is. De Cordoba and Bustamante travel
together to almost all the psychiatric congresses
held abroad; according to Major Bernabe Ordaz, the two
of them would like to take over the Havana Psychiatric
Hospital, and base their desire on the fact that Ordaz
is not a psychiatrist. In subsource's opinion, they
will never be successful in replacing Ordaz, because
Ordaz enjoys the backing of both Fidel Castro and
Celia Sanchez, who are good friends of his.

e. Subsource has known a Dr. -Fduundo G UT TERREZ
Agramonte, Psychiatrist, since 1959; Gutierrez is
Director of the magazine of Havana Psychiatric Hospital
and attends psychiatric congresses held abroad. He is
a competent psychiatrist and has an office located on
Calle 23, corner of Calle 18, Vedado, Havana City:

In subsource's opinion, he is antiregine although he
speaks in favor of the regime when with proregime
persons, and against the-regime when with antiregime
persons. He does not belong.to the PCC cell at the
‘hospital and is not a militiaman. In an assembly held
at the hospital in 1969 with the express purpose of
increasing the number of members of the PCC cell, no
one proposed Gutierrez as a possible aspirant. Gutierr
is about 50 years old and was married about February 196

congress; subsource could give no further information
on the congress or Mignagaray's date of departure.

Psychiatrist, joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionary
forces in the Escambrzy mountains a few months before
the Playa Giron invasion; he was arrested shortly
before said invasion and sentenced to 30 years in
prison. Subsource had met him when both were students ¢
at Belen High School; their friendship continued at
Havana University, when both were members of the
Havana University Catholic Group, and later as members
of the Movement for the Recuperation of the Revoluticn a
(MRR). Subsource took leave of Fernandez the day that
the latter joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionarices,
and never saw him again. When subsource visited his
brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso,. held first on the
Isle of Pines, then at La Cabana and later at the
Guanajay Jail, he habitually asked for news of
Dr. Fernandez; the information he received made him
believe that Fernandez is one of the most respected
prisoners because of his bravery and equilibrium.
Fernandez was mentioned as an example of integrity.
Other prisoners such as Dr. Andres CAO , Juan
BUSTAMNANTE , and Antonio GARCIA’ told
subsource that Fernandez’ attitude had not varied.
Fernandez' wife, Emilia LUZARRAGA , who
frequently visited subsource professionally (subsource
was her psychiatrist), also told subsource that
Fernandez' attitude was firmly antiregi Luzarraga
ds also antiregime.

belonged to both the Havana University Catholic Group

a. Dr. Jose *BUSTAMENTE O'Leary, psychiatrist,
was brought up by his aunts; he does not know the
identity of his mother. He, together with Raul Roa,
Justo Carrillo, and others, comes from the ranks of
the left wing of the student movement: lic joined the
Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1944, supported
presidential candidate Dr. Carlos Saladrigas in the
presidential elections held that year, - When Dr. Grau
was elected President, Subject’ concentrated.on his
professional activities, earning considerable pres-
tige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining .
a his political relationships with senators, cdlonos, e
etc. In 1952, the year of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente
had such friendly relations with both presidential
. candidates that, if the general elections scheduled
for June. 1952 had been held, Subject would have been
made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agri anonte
had been elected, and (b) Minister without cartera
(portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been elected.

b. After the, 10 March 1952 coup d'etat,”
Subject. opposed the de facto government in
spite vi.nis ciose relations with Dr. MORALES
del Castillo, who offered Subject the post of
Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consult ivo)

- which post Subject rejected. Subject began to
conspire against the regime with Justo Carrillo
and Dr. Araujo, constituting the organization

. called the Montecristi Group. Subject continues
to maintain a close relationship with Dr. Araujo,
now President of. the Cuban Medical College,
Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of
Havana University, and functionary of the Higher
Nervous Activity Research Institute.

ce. After the 1 January 1959 Revolution,
Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con
tent. of the Revolution and participated directly
in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia. One of
Urrutia's assistants was Subject's patient and
informed Subject of events occurring within the
Presidential Palace, Subject then consulted with
Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-
Communist.

d. Subject is very intelligent, very com-
petent, and an extraordinarily hard worker. He
is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University
Medical School, and Director of the Higher Nervous
Activity Research Institute. During the decade
1950-60, he held a high post within the Cuban
Medical College and was President of the World
Nedical Group; during this decade he made many
visits to the USA on matters related to:his pro-
fessional activities.
: e. It has been commented that Subject performed
“brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE.
During the period in 1966 that subsource was held
prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject;
subsource has never heard anyone state that he
actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's
opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT,
it was probably as professor of psychology in classes
given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that
the classes would have been similar to those that
Subject gave to Cuban artists.

nt 1. In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily
beautiful mistress that he still continu to visit
and support, This mistress, Nanolita Canto, was
divorced by her husband, Salup (fnu), after a. private
detective hired by the husband surprised Subject and
Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida; subsequently,
U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subject from
entering the U.S.A, Canto had. had one son by her
husband; when her husband died, the son inherited

the father's wealth, which was considerable: The
laws against private property promulgated by the
Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position

to the point that she has had to go to work; she now
works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute)
located at 23 and L Streets, Vedado, Havana City:

Subject surrendered his private practice to the Cuban
Government, and receives only his salary as Director
of the Hygher Nervous Activity Research Institute,
which salary amounts to 800 Cuban pesos; this salary
is insufficient to permit Subject to intain his
own home and his mistress's separate home and to lead
the type of life to which he was accustomed,

g. Subject is described as lacking in. normal
affections, cold and. calculating, .a typical schizoid
interested only in himself, never makes.a friendly. ’
gesture, has almost no friends.” Subject is generally: -
disliked and has many enemies who feel real ‘hate towards
him. The young Revolutionary medical doctors refuse
to have anything to do with him. Fidel Castro does
not know who Subject is and has certainly never been
treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment
from any other psychiatrist. Subject must be very un-
happy and downcast at his present situation: His
income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life;
he no longer travels extensively abroad (formerly,
he traveled abroad every three months); he holds no
representative office; he is not politically or socially
prominent and, indeed, no one pays him the slightest
attention. Subsource states categorically that he
believes that "Dr. Bustamente would be willing to
accept any offer, He would take the bait if given
half a chance."

h. The trip that Subject made to the USSR in +
the early 1960's was a "pleasure trip.” So far as
subsource knows, Subject received no-training in the
USSR. 7 mite : :

i. Subject is not known to have any relations
with SovBloc officia Havana. He-does maintain
close relations; with(Dr) LOPEZ Sanchez ({nu), an C/T

1.. (Summary; The National Center for Scientific Research
(CNIC) is an autonomous organization controlled by the Office
: of the Prime Minister, who appointed the Director, Dr. Wilfredo
Torres, M,D,, and other important executives, The CNIC exists
basically to perform scientific research and to train personnel
for employment as (a) CNIC researchers, (b) researchers for the
National Research Institutes that collaborate with the CNIC, oot
(c) medical school faculty members, (d) industria? se?
f (ec) and researchers and workers in the pure sciences, The CNIC
has departments of Biochemistry, Ultracentrifugation, Electronic
Microscopy, biedical Botany, Microbidogy and Virology, and Bio-
mechanics and Biomedical Studies. The CNIC graduate training
program for medical doctors confers the degree of Luctor of
Basic Sciences upon completion of the three-year }.csram; in
the future, the CNIC will also graduate Doctors of Pure Sciences
The National Research Institutes, of which there ave av least 12.
are organized by médical specialties and work in coordination
with the CNIC but are subordinate to the MINSAP. All are
clinical research institutes that work primarily with patients.
These institutes include the Institutes of Endocrinology,
Nephrology, iMematology, Gastroenterology, Neurology and Neuro-
! surgery, Physiopathology, Psychology and Neurophysiology, 5
C Hygiene and Epidemiology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery,

enna arse

Microbiology and Virology, Angiology, and Parasitology.)

i
i : 2, he National Center for Scientific Research (Centro
tEeceeea Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas, CNIC) is located in H
i Reparto Siboney (formerly Country Club), Marianao, Havana Pro~ i
tae vince, next to the Victoria de Giron premedical school (formerly
7 Colegio Sagrado Corazon), and occupies several impressive new ,
buildings; in addition, large private homes in the area have
been equipped as laboratories and residences for CNIC personnel.
As of mid-November 1967, some of the residences were occupied by
; foreign scientists. }

3. The CNIC is an autonomous organization controlled by :
the Office of the Prime Minister, through which its funds are t
budgeted, Important matters concerning the CNIC are handled
6 personally by Fidel Castro, whose approval is required for
foreign exchange expenditures. such as the purchase of equipment.
contracting of foreign’ personnel, ‘trips abroad by CNIC per-
sonnel, and recruiting campaigns aimed at foreign scientists.
: Fidel Castro, rather than ex-Minister Machado Ventura, appointed
Hy the director and other important CNIC executives. Dr. Wilfredo iz a8
Torres, M.D., hematologist, is CNIC director. The Public Health _
Ministry (MINSAP) plays no part in the supervision of the CNIC 3
and cannot influence the decisions of its executives.

4. The organization and functions of the CNIC are con-
fidential alfhough not secret, and any person who has contact
with medical professors can acquire some information on the
CNIC. Since about June 1967, an ID card issued by the CNIC to |

caatae its employees is required to enter the CNIC buildings and the eee
4 private homes that have been equipped as laboratories and resi- “4 -
dences, au
5. CNIC activities are oriented towards three fundamental
objectives, namely; :

a, Scientific research related to’ the medical sciences. |

b. The preparation of highly qualified research and
professorial personnel for employment, after gradu-
. ation, as (1) CNIC researchers, (2) researchers of i

(3) members of the faculty of the three Cuban medical
schools (referred to as schools of medical sciences)
located in Havana City, Santa.Clara, and Santiago de
Cuba, and (4) biochemists and microbidogasts in 1ndus-
tries related to tit nedical sciences, such as the
pharmaceutical industry.

¢, The prepsration of personnel for.work in the pure
sciences; this thfird objective constitutes a more.
ambitious but long-range goal that was still: in the
organizational and planning stage in January 68, Part
of the personnel so trained would remain at the.Center
as CNIC researchers;. part would join the faculties of
the university schools of pure sciences, and: part would
enter Cuban industry to work on the applications of
technology to production,

Scientific Research

6. Scientific research related to the medical sciences
is done at both the CNIC and at the National Research Institutes,
The general directives for such research are oriented towards;

The experimental verification of conclusions arrived at,
or discoveries made, by foreign scientists, This work
of verification is effected (1) principall» in order
to train Cuban personnel in the methods of higher re-
Search, but also (2) as an attempt to contribute in-
formation complementary to the discovery.

Original research work done by Cuban personnel advised
by foreign scientists, This work is directed towards ~
(1) the attainment of results of international or~
tance to be used in propaganda praising Castro's
education system, and (2) the achievement of discoveries
“in applied science that would serve either as an econ-
omic saving or to earn foreign exchange. AS of sid-
January 68, CNIC research projects had producea nothing
of scientific importance, During the first half of 67,
. Fidel Castro ordered the CNIC.to orient all its re-
search projects towards production technology so that -
the foreign exchange invested in the projects could be
partially recovered through improved production,

7. Department of Biochemistry. -The most important of the
CNIC departments is the Department of Biochemistry; it occupies

11, Department of Electronic Microscopy, This department: was
functioning in Nevomber 1967 and contained two electron micro-
scopes of tie highest quality, one Polish-made and the other
believed to be Japanese. It was performing research in cytology,
ultrastructure ( “Vtremicrescopic structure of tissues of
living beings), crystallography, and the three-dinensional !
Spatial structure of certain biological substances. i

12, DEpartment of Medical Botany, This departuent is headed
by a very intelligent and caTeired Spanish agronui st named .
Guillermo Cid who has been in Cuba since 1940, It is effecting |
a systematic study of Cuban flora in order to detevuine the ;
pharmacological and therapeutical properties of Cuban plants.
The department works in coordination with the experimental
station in Santiago de las Vegas that is directed by the eminent
92-year old Dr. Juan Tomas Roig Mesa, who is the greatest Cuban
expert on Cuban and tropical TIdra and one of the greatest is
authorities in the world on medicinal plants. In addition, the |
department has the cooperation of all the experimental agron-
comical stations in Cuba, which send the department samples of i
any plant considered worth. investigation; the department con- ;
ducts an exhaustive analysis of such samples, The research has

two objectives: :

a, The utilization of the curative properties of the
plants, which constitute a cheap supply of national
raw materials and can replace many imported pro-
ducts.

b. The launching on the world market of competitive t
pharmaceutical products, following the example :
of Red China and Bulgaria.

13, The work of the Department of Medical Botony will pro-
pably be successful because of (a) the qualifications and com-
petence of its director, Guillermo Cid, (b) the extraordinary i
impulse that has ‘been imparted to its research program, and :
(c) the extraordinary richness of Cuban flora-in medicinal plants. —

As of September 1966, a department that would do research on bio-~
mechanics was being organized within the CNIC. The Cuban Govern- |
ment is aware of the enormous medical importance of the appli- i
cation of cybernetics (problem solving by electronic computers) j

15. The research projects of this department were to be
‘directed fundamentally towards the study and electronic compu=
“tation of the medification ir both healthy and sick persons of
such: biologicul parameters as hemodynamic curves, concentr:
tion and saturation of gases and alterations-in the basic acid
equilibrium of the blood, and were to includé the study of the
variations in the biological parameters from the biochemical
and hemodynamic point of view during cardiovascular surgery _
and in physiological research related tu the cardiovascular ap=
Paratus. In neurophysiology. and neuropharmacology, the re-
search projects would be oriented towards research on higher
nervous activity including electrical modifications produced
in higher nervous activity; in hematology, the projects would
be oriented towards the study of isoimmunization and patho-
logical alterations of the different blood cells. The electron-

: ic computers would be needed to process the immense quantities
of data such research would produce.

17. Dr. Fernando J. Toro, a medical doctor who is also
an electrical engineer, was to head this department. Toro
is reputed to be very intelligent, a gifted organizer, highly
motivated, and by far the best man available in Cuba for the
type of research described; he has. more than 20 years ex-
perience in electromedical instruments. i

18. Reduced Number of Research Projects. The scarcity
of research projects can easily be explained by the fact thar
Cuba, which -has no considerable scientific tradition, must
first train personnel in the higher methods of scientific
research, and such training requires years of effort. The few
- persons prepared to do important research are at the present
time occupied in the administrative and pedagogical organization
of the CNIC and cannot work full-time as researchers.

19. Research in Antibiotics. In 1960, Dr. Jose Antonio
Padron, an eminent research ecientist, began work onthe isola-
tion and culture of antibiotic substances, the study of their
properties, and experimentation with said substances; he ini-
tiated this work at the Oncological Hospital but is now a CNIC
collaborator. As of December 1967, he had isolated and exhaus-
tively studied 89 new antibiotics, many of which are too toxic
for human use. His work demonstrates his great ability and
perserverance, and with the material resources of the CNIC at
his disposal, should result in discoveries of scientific im-
Portance.

CRIC Training Program
ERIC Training Program

. 29, Doctor of Basic Sciences, The CNIC offers a three-
year training program leading to the degree of Doctor of Basic
Sciences for which program fifth-year medical students with
exceptional academic standing can qualify if (a) during their
college career they have shown special aptitudes for teaching
and research, (b) the UC gives them-an "A" grade in political
standing or reliability, and (c) they are cleared by a DSE
investigation. In 1966, of the students then in the fifth
year of medical school, only six were accepted by this training
program; all were excellent students and UJC members and are
now medical doctors: Ramon Ortiz, Rosa Elena Simeon, Ismael
Clavk Arce, lilda Donderis,’ Julio Rolriguez Docal, and his
WiTe Maira (Inu). As of April 1968, probably no more than 30
Students were studying in this training program, chiefly be-
cause of the rigorous entrance requir 2ments.

Neither Santiago de Cuba nor Santa Clara has a similar insti-

tute. ‘ :

28. As of September 1967, students from Las Villas,
Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces who desire to enter medical’
school as first-year students must matriculate at either
Santa Clara or Santiago de Cuba University; this measure was
put into effect. in order to reduce congestion at Havana Uni~
versity. :

National Research Institutes

_ 29, The following National Research Institutes, organized
by medical specialties, work in coordination wits the CNIC but
are’ subordinate to the NINC\P. All were organized as "insti-
tutes" during the first three months of 1967, although some had
been functioning for years under different names, Al] are
clinical research institutes that work primarily with patients.
Each institute centrols all the hospital departxents throughout
Cuba that correspond to the specialty of the institute. For
example: The Endocrinology Institute controls #11 the hospital
departments of endocrinology in Cuba.

30. Endocrinology Institute, The Endocrinology Institute
replaced the Tormer Institute for Endocrinological Research :
that was founded and directed by Dr. Yamil Kouri. The insti-
tute is located at the same site as the former institute; the
ground floor of the leit wing of the Fajardo Hospital, Havana
City. It is headed by Dr. Oscar Mateo de Acosts, M.D., Cuba's
most eminent endocrinologist. Dr. Mateo is extraordinarily
intelligent, a university professor and PCC member, and is one
of the scientific bulwarks of the Castro Regime. Mateo's
assistants include Dr. Catalina Eibenschuz, who is marricd 10
Dr. Mora, head of the CNIC Department of Biochemistry, and
was studying endocrincology in.France in early €8; Dr. Barto-
lome Arce, who studied in Rumania and:was studying in France
in early 68; and a young medical doctor named Oviedo (fnu),
who was probably. to be sent to Sweden. to study. He

has departments at the Willian soler Hospital, the Fajardo :
Hospital, and the National Hospital, all located in Havana
City. The institute has no building of its own and its
activities are located at:the three best hematological clinics
in Cuba, as enumerated above, The Director of the Hematology t
Institute ja Dr. Eduardo de ja Torre, who is also chief of the i
Department of Hematology, william Soler Hospital. Dr. Ulacia
(fnu), who is probably Cuba's best hematologist, is chief of
the Departmeat of Hematology of the Fajardo Hospital.

36. The most important research Project of the Hematology
Institute was initiated about July 66 and consisted of the
study of the “utilization of isoniazida in the treatment of
Werholf's (as received) disease J purpura trombopenica idio-
patica." The value of isoniazida in the treatment of werholt's
diséase was discovered by cnance under the following circum-
stances: A child hospitalized in the hematological department
of the William Soler hospital for treatment of Werholf's dis-—
ease contracted a primary tuberculosis infection; when this
infection was treated with isoniazida. the. symptom-complex of
Werholf's disease disappeared completely and no relapse occur-
red: As of January -1968,. 22 such cases had been Studied and the
conclusions were being prepared for presentation at a Henato-
logical Congress; the biological mechanism of the treatment had
not yet been determined, but it was considered that the experi-~
mental stage had-been completed, :

37.. Dr. Eduardo de la Torre was Performing research —
principally of a statistical nature — on leucemias. Infantile
leucemia was being studied at the William Soler Hospital and

45. As of May 1966, Dr. Bustamante was doing research on
social psychology (€hé psyChoTO@ical CHIPUCKEFIStICS Of indi-..
viduals belonging to a specific socioeconomic group) and had
very ambitious plans to use electronic data processing machines
to study the electrochemical processes and the servomechanisms
of higher nervous activity; these ambitious plans were to be
put into effect in 1967, .The land located behind the institute
was to serve for the construction of other departments of the
institute.

46. Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute. .The Hygiene and
Epidemiology listitute functions at two Separate installations.
Institute headquarters and its hygiene section occupy a
building on Calle Infanta, Havana City. Dr. Cosme Ordofiez,
M.D., is director of the institute; he is described as very
intelligent and very well-organized. During the first six
months of 196% he took a course in hygiene and epidemiology
at the University of London. Or, Plasencia (fnu) is another of
the principal figures at the institute.

47, Public health data received from all parts of Cuba
are processed at the institute headquarters on Cal Infanta
(DOJ; September 1966), In addition to the hygiene section
institute hoadquarters contains a well-equipped Virology Depart-
ment, which has an electron microscope, a well-equipped Serums
and Vaccines Department, a school for public-health workers,
and a school of medical statisticians.

48. The epidemiological section of the institute is ~..
located at Las Animas Anti-infectious Hospital, Havana, at
which medical care is provided and research work done.’ Las..
Animas Hospital was vtotally rebuilt during the period 1962-65
and is a model hospital thac compares favorably with any other.

Dear Dr. Bustamante:

Ihave recently completed a reading of your
paper entitled "Cultural Pactors in Hysterias with
Schizophrenic Clinical Pictures." I found it to be
of great interest and I appreciate your sending it
to me. Ihave been working with Dr. William Wolf
on the projection of medical education and psychiatry
ae they are likely to be in the next century. The
first of a series of articles and of a monograph,
was published in the April 1966 issue of the American
Journal of Psychotherapy. This takes in a great deal
of analysis that would be included under transcultural
psychiatry. Indeed, we are using the systems analysio
approach vhich, of course, must take inte account the
broad psychosocial and socioeconomic forces thdt in-
fluence the péychodynamics matrices in Individuals.
I am interested in the particular securities that are
precipitated in the ego structure of individuals by
the very nature of the socioeconomic, sociopolitical
- and sociophilosophic system in which the individual
lives: In an opposite vein, we sre interested in the
‘stresses that are placed upon the individual by vari-
ous social systems from individual and practical stand-
points. Awarenesses such as these should be of help
+ in the planning of social systems for underdeveloped
nations. While this seems like a very ambitious con-
ceptualization, I do not believe that it is an unlikely
. possibility in the coming generations.

: 1 look forward to receive the copy of your
book “Psicologia Medica", Volume I. ‘I believe that the
outline as you presented it to me seems very inclusive.

recently told BRYRH@PAMin Havand that the World Congress of Psychology

Dear Dr. Redlich: :

‘ L: December 14,.1966, I wrote you a long letter giving you

all the information about our activities at the Institute. I have
not heard from you ever since, and I am afraid this letter did not

’

reach you at al therefore, I am enclosing a copy and following
ere a few more news about this year's activities so far.

I wieh to let you know that in July our new Review called
Tranacultural Psychiatry will be published here. Aa goon as it ia
out, I will mail you a copy. We are editing it and it will be the
first of ita kind in our language.

We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute
‘now, Dr. Antonio Santa Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning @
oint book on Transcultural Psychiatry since there is not a treatise
pert on this subject, I will let’ you know as to ite develop~
ment. Bee

In’reference to the Reviews that you so kindly offered to send
us, we are for the time being overcoming the shortage we were ex~
periencing. Instead, and if at all possible, I would like to receive

‘ol. III of the American Handbook of Psychiatry, edited by Silvano
Arieti. I have Vole. I and II, and would be obliged to you if you
could send it.to me.

Although I know your interest is.in Psychiatry, I wish to
inform you that we are organizing a Symposium of Psychology which
will take place in’Havana, the 24-30 of November, 1565, convened by
the Institute and the Academy of Sciences. Its subject will be:
“Motivation: meurophysiologic, psychologic and sociai factors. Pers-
pective of an integration", The peper could te on motivation: 2%

- Gan be an interdisciplinary subject, as well as neurophysiologic,
psychologic ora social one.

I do not know whether you are interested or not, but in case
you are, please let me know and I will send you’an invitation. The
guests' stay will be borne by the Academy of Sciences, and we heve

Three of the scientists that have already accepted to come to

* the Symposium visited the Institute this year. "One of them was Dr,

Vladimir D. Nebyliteyn, Vice-Director of the Institute of Paychology
from Moscow, who stayed ‘two months with us. He helped uo to create

@ typology laboratory in our Paychology Department. At the same time, |

nH tere @ course on typology variables according to Teplov and
imself,

He works principally studying personality. His Conception ig
primarily based in the human brain properties that were discovered
by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and hia collaboratora.

De Nebylitayn, aa well as other Saves tigatora, have developed
gome acientific methoda on the investigation of such properties of
the nervous system and their etudies nowadays can very well be:
correlated with certain Personality dimensions. It has been thus
proven by some investigators abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to

Querido Amigos ae

Aprovechando un nuevo viaje del amigo V.risco te escribo otra vez para
ssluderte y darte unos informes que cred de importancia.

También le estoy escribiendo,a Segu{n y Dévila. Les hago saber @ todos
que en el mes de Julio saldra el primer numero de nuestra Revista Psi-
guistrfa Trenscultursl de la cusl les enviare un ejempler tan pronto
alge. z

Bn,el mes de Noviembre se ha de celebrar una reunién de 1a Organiza
eion Sanitaris ri aes ea sobre la "Ensefisnze de le Psicologis uedi-
cs y la Psiquiatria en América," a la que pienso asistir pues he sido
inviteds le Faculted de Medicine de le Universidad de la Habens por le
organizacion y la. Xequited casi con toda seguridad-me ha, de designer,
en ese caso no tendria problemas pues ellos se ocupan de conseguir la
visa y de todos los demés detalles relacionados con le reunion.

Bn e1 mes de Enero le escrib{ una extensa carte a Pichot que en el
Congreso de Madrid estuvo tratando de producir ja reunion de los
esistentes 81 mismo que se dedican s la Psicologia Médica.

cambien impresiones los norteamericanos, europeos y latinoamericanos
Ye que cada uno de dicho grupo tenemos nuestra propis opinion como
"gon sin dads les tres opiniones que rigen en el mundo en esta materia.

1 por su,parte nos defraudo tanto s mi como 8 Seguin pues realizo
uns reunion intrascegdente y se puso en contacto con gente que no re=
presente la Psicologis Hedica en el mundo y por ejemplo, concretamen—
iP velecién 31 Peru, entrd en contacto, no con Seguin que estaba
alli, sino con un muchscho que no se dedica a esta disciplina.

Ese es le razén por la cual le escrib{ esa carte haciéndole esas cri-
ticas y sugiriendole que para tratar de esos problemas con nosotros
letinoemericenos tenfan fundsmentalmente que entrar en contacto con-
tigo, con Seguin y conmigo pues creo fuera de toda falsa modestie que
somos le més alta experiencie de le Psicologia Médice en America Leti-

‘ne y de hecho une corriente de Amportancia en el mundo.

No he tenido respuesta a esta carta todavia, pero si recin{ una neta
el donde me decia que habia estado verios meses fuera de Francia.

Ahore bien yo creo que lo mejor es que cembiemos impresiones los tres
por correo antes de llegar a la reunion en: Novienbre en Lima pues allf
nos yemos & poner de scuerdo los latinoemericanos sobre dicho problema, <!
Beguin baie ellf, ta no debes falter y yo voy @ hacer todo lo Posi- i
ble por ire .

Colombia y tal vez otras BBS, pero ei dessrrollo que hemos logredo en
Peru, México y Cuba por nuestros respectivos esfuerzos todo el mundo
reconoce y de no satarlo lo ecepta en cuanto se le informa.

Por ello es que ereo que es importante que cambiemos impresiones los
tres antes de llegar a Noviembre, para llegar a Lima con perspectivae
de wma linea sdecusds.

Luego debemos demandar de los nox teamericanos y de Pichot y los Europaos

un capbio de impresiones o indicérselo a 1a OMS como acuerdo de nuestra
reunion en Lins, Z

Con los mejores deseos bare ti y un fuerte abrazo, se despide tu amigo,

A We would appreciate an early answer from you about this so we
t can begin the necessary arrangements,

4s for your information about publishing a version of my letter
to you on activities at the Institute ie all right with me. In fact,
I consider it a great honor to tell your readers about us,

: I am happy. to know that you have received and read my paper on
"Cultural Factors in Hysterias with Schizophrenic Clinical plefures."
Por ny part, I will let you know thet I have read your monography
published in the April 1966 number of the American Journal of Psycho-
herapy. I found Tt extremely interesting and was glad to know that
there is more to come on this subject.

3 Thank you for your kind words about my book on Medical Paycho-
5 t logy. The one you received ie Vol. I; Vol. II will be out in August,
and I am working on Vol. III. As soon as Vol. II te out, I will: mail
you @ copy.

Three of the acientists that have already accepted to come to
ae the Symposium visited the Institute this year. (ne of them was Dr.
Be Viedimir D, Nebyliteyn, Vice-Director of the Institute. of Psychology
g . from Moscow, who stayed two months with us, He helped us to oreate
a typology laboratory in our Psychology Department, At the same time
poset toree @ course on topology variables according to Teplow and

elf. sai

He works principally. studying personality. His conception is
Pe tpartay based in the human brain properties that were discovered
_ by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and his collaborators.

Dr. Nebyliteyn, as well as other investigators, have developed
some acientific methods on the investigation of such properties of
the nervous system and their studies nowadaya can very well be
correlated with certain personality dimensions. It has been thus
proven by some investigatora abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to
° begin developing such scientific methods. .

We aleo had Dr. E. Roy John, from the New York Medical College,
. ‘who spent a month here.. Following is a brief reaumé of his activities
/ at the Institute, — - 2

. In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of
learning, having memory as a basic. theme, explained every possible
Way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and enatomically.

The lecture was discussed by those attending, and experimental so-
lutions were proposed for various problema not yet resolved, The text

Dear Dr. Kiev:

I received yours of May 17 a few days ago and I thank.
you for the information. . :

Pirst of all, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your book,
"Magic, Faith and Healing = Studies in Primitive Psychiatry
foday", for which I am grateful. It is most interesting and I
am reading it with great pleasure.

I want you to know that in July .a new Review called
Transcultural Psychiatry will be published here. We are editing
ait-and it will be the first of ita kind in our language. Ag
soon.as it ig ‘out, Iwill mail you a copy. This Review will be
the official: organ.of the Transcultural Paychiatry Commission of
the Cuban Society of Psychiatry and the Cuban Group of Trans-
cultural Studies in which a resumé, translation or ‘comments in
Spanish of all the works written the world over will be published.
Later on, it will become the publication media for the Cuban
Society of Paychiatry works, as well as. those written by the Trans-
oultural Psychiatry Section of the Institute, gathering in it all
Cuban publications and giving opportunity too to some latin
American scientists' papers, but always keeping comments, trans-
lation or resumé ‘of other Reviews. “At the beginning, the Review
will appear every 6 months, but later on. it will be a quarterly.

cee We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute
-" now, Dr. Antonio Santa Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning
a joint book on Transcultural Psychiatry, since there is not a
treatise in Spanish on this subject that I know of, I will let
you know as to ita development.



Ari Kiev, M.D. : =2-

We have had three scientists visiting the Inetitute this year.
One of them wae Dr. Vladimir D. Nebylitoyn, Vice= Director of the
Institute of Psychology from Moscow, who stayed two months with us. ‘
He helped us to create a typology laboratory in our Psychology 7
Department. At the same time, he offered a course on typology i
variables according to Teplov and himself. sunaciiiet)

. Ho works principally studying personality. His conception is
i primarily based in the human brain properties that were discovered
Ee by Pavlov and later on wore developed by Teplov and hia collaborators.

Dr Nebylitayn, eas well as other inveatigatore, have developed aa
some scientific methods on the investigation of. auch properties of 4
the nervous system and their studies nowadaya: can very well be - oi
correlated with certain. personality dimensions. It has been thus i
proven by gome investigators abroad and today, in Cub 1, we need to ot

i

begin developing such scientific methoda.

We also had Dr. EB. Roy John, from the New York Medical College,
who spent a month here. Following ie a brief resumé of his activities:
at the Institute,

In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of
learning, having memory as a basic theme, explained every posaible
Way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and anatomically.
The leoture was discussed by those attending, and experimental ' A
solutions were proposed for. various probleme not yet resolved. ‘The
text book used in this course was written by Dr. John himself and will
be out of print by now. ; a

In the afternoons, four different experiments were carried out.
fhe first one on evoked potentials in humans, correlations of same.
fac: luminous stimulations of different colors. Influence of
expectancy situations, ‘The second experiment waa on learning,

The fourth experiment was a study with microelectrodes of neuronal -
activity changes during the learning stage in cronic animale.

Both Dr. Nebyliteyn and Dr. John dictated very interesting
conferences at-the Academy ef Sciences' Conference Hall and at the
Scientific Council of the Ministry of Public Health.

At the moment, we have Dr. B, Grastydén, from the University of
Pecs, Hungary, who will leave soon after collaborating with the Depart-
ment of Paychology for two months. He has been working on motivation
and cooperating in a joint work for our coming Symposium. =



Ari Kiev, H.D. : : -}-

._',, Jost todey I received the 1966 Report on Activities of the Inter-
national Committee Against Mental Illness, also, I got the picture
taken during the luncheon in Madrid, for which I thank you.

Reading the Report I noticed there is a Bulletin de Centre de i
Peychiatrie et de Reurologie in Haiti. I would like to receive copy :
or copies of numbers that have already appeared. I do not know aractly
where to write, or to whom address the letter, so will you kindly take }
care of this for me. |

Algo, I am interested in the International Journal of Paychiatry
published in Boston, which I would like to receive too, You could give
hen ay name with the Institute address so they can send me the copies. i
To both these Reviews you can tell them that aince I am Director of
both the bulletin of: the Institute and the new Review of Transcultural
Peychiatry I am-officially proposing an exchange for ther Review, or
elee they can tell me what they. want me to do.

Incidentally, I wish to call your attention to the fact that the:
Institute's name now ig Instituto de. Neurofisiologfa.y Psicologia, not
-Inetituto de Investigaziones de la Actividad Nerviosa Superior, as the
aforemontioned Report was addressed; The address was correct, Loma y
31, Alturas del Vedado, Havana, Cuba.

I think I should let you know that I have eritten to Dr. D. Leigh,
Seerctary to the World Peychiatric Association and emong other things
I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section of Trans=
cultural Psychiatry within the World Peychiatric Association. because

{ this ia a rather new and multi-disciplinary field (comprising psychia-

_ trists, psychologists, anthropologists, etc.) requiring more ‘than any
other one the cooperation and help to facilitate the efforte to keep

. Producing and offering contributions in the development of this field.

I have secured a better way to get our. mail and it consists of
the following: address your envelope to Laboratorios Erba, Apartado
21909, Mexico 21, D.P., Mexico, and the letter to me. Once t. ey open
the letter and see it is addressed tome, a member of the laboratory
will bring it personally-to we as they travel back.and forth between
our countries. I will address my lettera to you and they will mail ©
them in Mexico to you. In this way, we are both sure our mail will
not get lost since I have absolute confidence in then.

I am taking this opportunity to send you book, "Nedical Peycho~
logy", in three volumes of which this is Vol. QP di

I think I have covered everything of interest to you.
Hoping to hear from you soon, and with best wishes, I am,

mation collection and who[have provided useful reports sirce
early 1962, from CC-3138,4Jorge yulig Beato Nuflez, 31.D, ,. Pedia-

¥ _Florida,_U,S,A,/a copy of the magazine Tribuna Medica (Medical
Tribune), which’ contains a complete list oF a1) the "professionals"
(presumably medical doctors) remaining in Cuba and all those who
have left Cuba, Dr,. Fernandez acknowledged receipt of the magazine
Dr. Fernandez was the last President_of_the National. Medical
College of Cuba, dissolved t n April 1966,

files, the complete list of all the Cuban medical doctors who had
taken the Foreign Board examinations in Florida, U,S.A., together
with the grades received, This also "appeared in the School of
Medicine, Havana University". The examinations are highly cun-
fidential and it is inexplicable how such private intormation
could be published in Cuba, Medical doctors in Cuba’ presume ‘that
"said organization must be infiltrated by Communists" who pirated
the information and forwarded it to Cuba, y

en donde desempelé diversos cargoz, pwlo conocer ampliamente el deserrello
do la nedicina en Cuba hasta el 30 de ttril de 1967, es decir ha podido com
nocer también el desenvolvimiento de la medicina oubana durante el ré.-ixon
cestro-comuniata, Siendo lo quo a continuacién expreso un enjuiciamiento
del mismo en su triple especto docente, profesional y clasista.

Aspecto docente.

La Universidad de la Habana fué fundeda en el afio 1728 y fueron preciaurente

los estudios médicos los primeros en ser organizados coro Facultad. $i ol pa-

“gedo puede vensgloriarse de haber sido cuna de dos nombres. preclaros en le His~

teria de la Medicina, como son Tomds ROMAY, sabio introductor de la vecuna er.
Cuba y el Dr. Garlos J, FIRLAY, genial descubridor del agente transmisor de la
fiebre amarilla, Bn la época republicana adquirié juste fama por la celiaud de
evs profesores, la rigidez de sus planes de estudio y la briliantes de sus ere~
duados. Pero no es: el Bomento de citar nombres que justifiquen tales cacuera-
Ciones. Basta decir tan solo que la Facultad de Medicina, preoisamente, estaba
clesificada coco A-l en el ranking de las facultades similares del imunmio entero,
al igual que les mejores universidades de los Estados Unidos de América.

Con el advenimiento del régimen commista de Fidel CASTRO, comenzé la dasintegra—

¢4én de la Universidad de 1a Habana, para volverla a integrar, como une rueda mia

er-le inmensa taquinaria comunista del Gobierno. Siendo.precisamente ©: faculied

de Nedicina 1a prinera en ser atacade, alegando diversos protextos de indcie se-

cundaria, lo que trajo como consecuencia la remmeia de la mejor parte de au pro-

fesorado. Con la emigracién de los médicos cubanos casi en masa, que repudiaban
el régizen totalitario y tirdnioo que se instauraba en la Isla, agudizdndobo la
earencia de profesores en la Facultad de Medicina.

Eodo_ do resolver este grave problema se le creaba al rézinen de Castr..

En primes lugar nonbrando profesores de "dedo", es decir que nunca hicie:

tormente profedores de le facultad, no tionen le libertad de ensefianza propia

na colectiva propia de los eistecas marxistas-leninistes.

Del alumnado puede decirse pin exageracién alguna, que es él mis malo eu 1a largs |
historia de 1a ya bi-centenaria Universidad de le Eabana, Como lo qué se quiere
obtener es un tipo de médico politico, ciego observante de les reglas conunistas

eximen, las mis de las veces anaiado, puede hacer su ingreso en los estulios mé~

tdlmente a 1a gran masa de profesionales enigrados, las notas se dan por sicple

asistencia a clases, hay que graduar médicos a toda costa, dicen los dirigentes

comunistas y para que se vea hasta donde llegan en esté sentido, vaya 1a siguior

te anécdota vividea por el Dr. BEATO, 1a cual refleja con exactitud esta gran

época pre-comunista, que cuando CASTRO se apodera del poder, le faltaban pocas
asignaturas pare greduarse de médico. Como es un cubano denécrata, aprobé to-—
das. menos una, que no quiso exaninar, para no coger el titulo de médics ajo e}

“lo hacia, no tuvo mis remedio que hacerlo, pero bus0d adrede: el suspense, con~

importa que haya demostrado su capacidad en la materia que son propias de la

Medicina, si no tiene aptitudes de alpinista o no quiere hacer la gran eaca~

servar del tezor casi sagrado con que son mirados estos médicos denowinados

“cinco pices" por la poblacién éubana, que con razén los desprocia y,que jus-
