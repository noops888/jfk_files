Subject is President or Director of the

thinks that Subject is also Professor of Medical

Psychology at Havana University.

subject is a very

well trained psychiatrist and has alsays enjoyed

great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always

been reputed to have very low morals, and in medical

circles is "famous" as a woman chaser.

He is widely

his colleagues' wives.

Subject to be a vulgar political scheng utterly

lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new"

O'Leary,

a.

Dr. Jose *BUSTAMENTE O'Leary, psychiatrist,

was brought up by his aunts; he does

not know the

identity of his mother.

He, together with Raul Roa,

Justo Carrillo, and others,

comes

from the ranks of

the left wing of the student movement: he joined the

Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1944, supported

presidential candidate Dr. Carlos Saladrigas

in the

presidential elections held that year.

When Dr. Grau

was elected President, Subject concentrated on his

professional activities,

earning considerable pres-

tige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining

his political relationships with senators, colonos,

etc.

In 1952, the year of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente

had

such friendly relations with both presidential

candidates that, if the general elections

scheduled

for June 1952 had been held,

Subject would have been

made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agramonte

had been elected, and (b) Minister without cartera

(portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been elected.

b.

After the, 10 March 1952 coup d'eint,

Subject opposed the de facto government

in

Spilt ui. nis chose relations with Dr. MORALES

del Castillo, who offered Subject the post of

Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consultivo)

which post Subject rejected.

Subject began to

conspire

against the regine with Justo Carrillo

and Di. Araujo, constituting the organization

called the Montecristi Group. Subject continues

to maintain a close relationship with Di. Araujo:

now President of the Cuban Medical College,

Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of

Havana University, and functionary of the Higher

Nervous Activity Research Institute.

c.

After the 1 January 1959 Revolution,

Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con

tent. of the Revolution

and participated directly

in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia.

One of

•Urrutia's

assistants was Subject's patient and

informed Sutject of events occurring within the

Presidential Palace.

Subject then consulted with

Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-

Communist.

d. Subject is very intelligent, very com-

petent, and an extraordinarily hard worker.

is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University

Medical School, and Director of the Higher Nervous

Activity Research Institute.

During the decade

1950-60,

he held a high post within the Cuban

Medical

College and was President of the World

Medical Group; during this decade he made many

visits to the USA on matters related to his pro-

fessional activities.

e.

It has been commented that Subject performed

"brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE.

During the period in 1966 that subsource was held

prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject;

subsource has never heard

anyone

state that he

actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's

opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT,

it was probably as professor of psychology in classes

given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that

the classes would have been similar to those that

Subject gave to Cuban artists.

1.

In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily

beautiful mistress that he still continues to visit

and

support.

This mistress, Manolita Canto, was

divorced by her husband, Salup (fnu),

after a private

detective hired by the husband surprised Subject and

Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida;

subsequently,

U.S. Immigration authorities prohibited Subject from

entering the U.S.A.

Canto had. had one son by her

husband; when her husband died, the son inherited

the father's wealth, which was

considerable.

The

lars against private property promulgated by the

Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position

to the point that she has had. to go to work; she now

works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute)

located at 23 and L Streets, Vedado, Harana City:

Subjret surrendered his private practice to the Cuban

Government,

and receives only his

salary

as Director

of the ligher Nervous Activity Research Institute,

which salary amounts to 800 Cuban pesos; this

salary

is insufficient to permit Subject to maintain his

own home and his mistress's separate home and to lead

the type of life to which he was accustomed.

Subject is described

as lacking in normal

affections, cold and calculating, a typical schizoid

interested

only in himself, never makes. a friendly

gesture, has almost no friends.

Subject is generally

disliked and has many enemies who feel scal hate towards

him. The young Revolutionary

medical doctors refuse

to have anything to do with him.

Fidel Castro does

not know who Subject is and has certainly never been

treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment

from

any other psychiatrist.

Subject must be very un-

happy and downcast at his present situation:

income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life;

he no longer travels extensively abroad (ormerly,

he traveled abroad every three months); he holds no

representative office; he is not politically or socially

prominent and, indeed, no one pays him the slightest

attention.

Subsource

states categorically that he

believes

that "Dr. Bustamente would be willing to

accept any offer. He would take the bait if given

half a chance."

The trip that Subject made to the USSR in

the early 1960's was a "pleasure trip."

So far as

subsource knows, Subject received no training in the

USSR.

1.

Subject is not known to have any relations

with SovBloc officials Inclavana.

He docs maintain

close relations: with Di) #LOPEZ Sanchez (Inu), an Cj1::483#

old-guard Communist of the so-called microfaction

who holds the post of Secretary of the Cuban Academy

J. Fidel Castro is a pathological schizo

which personality

type is characterized by latent homosexuality.

Raul Castro is just the opposite of what he appears

(Summary:

The National Center for Scientific Research

(CNIC) 15 an autonomous

organization controlled by the Office

of the Prime Minister, who appointed the Director, Dr. Wilfredo

Torres, M.D., and other important executives.

The CNIC exists

basically to perform scientific risearch and to train porsonned

for employment as (a) CNIC researchers, (b) researchers for the

sational Rescarch Institutes that collaborate with the CriC,

(c) medical

(c) and researchers and workers in the pure sciences.

schood taculty members, (d) Industria: se-ente chic

has departments of Blochemistry, Ultracentrifugation, Electronic

and 310-

microscopy, Medical Botany, Microbilogy and VirologY, training

nechanics

and Biomedical Studies.

The CNIC graduate

program

for medical doctors confers the degree of Luctor of

Basic Sciences upon completion of the three-year 1. gram;

in

the future,

the CNIC will also graduate Noctors of Pure Science:

The National Research Institutes, of which there de at least 1

are organized by medical specialties and work in coordination

with the CNIC but are subordinate to the MINSAP. All are

clinical rescarch institutes that work primarily with pettents.

These institutes include the Institutes of Endocrinology,

Nephrology, lematology, Gastroenterology, Neurology and Neuro-

surgery, Physiopathology, Psychology and Neurophysiology,

llygiene

and Epidemiology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery,

Microbiology and Virology, Angiology, and Parasitology.)

The National Conter for Scientific Research (Centro

Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas, CNIC) is located in

Reparto Siboney (formerly Country Club), Marianao, Havana Pro-

vince, next to the Victoria de Giron premedical school (ormerly

colegio Sagrado Corazon), and occupies several impressive new

buildings; in addition,

large private homes in the area nave

been equippod as laboratories

and residences for CNIC personnel.

As of mid-November 1967, some of the residences were

occupied by

foreign scientists.

-

The CNIC is an autonomous organization controlled by

the office of the Prime Minister, through which its funds are

budgeted.

Important matters concerning the CNIC are handled

personally by Fidel Castro, whose approval is required for

foreign exchange expenditures. such as the purchase of equipment.

contracting of foreign personnel, trips abroad by CNIC per-

sonnel, and recruiting campaigns

aimed at foreign scientists.

Fidel

Castro, rather than ex-Minister Machado Ventura, appointed

the director and other important CNIC executives.

Dr. Wilfredo

Torres, M.D., hematologist, is CNIC director.

The Public Health

Ministry (MINSAP) plays no part in the supervision of the CNIC

and cannot influence the decisions of its executives.

The organization and functions of the CNIC are con-

fidential although not secret, and any person who has contact.

fundamental

objectives, namely:

The proparation of personnel for work in the pure

sciences; this thiid objective constitutes a morc

ambitious but long-range goal

that was still in the

organizational and planning stage in January

68.

As CNIC researchers; part would join the faculties of

the university schools of pure sciences

and. part would

enter Cuban industry to work on the applications of

technology to production.

Scientific Research

6. Scientific research related to the medical sciences

is done at both the CNIC and at the National Research Institutes.

The general directives for such research are oriented towards:

The experimental verification of conclusions arflys work

or discoveries made, by foreign scientists.

of verification is effected (1)

principall. in order

to train Cuban personnel in the methods of higher re

but also (2) as an attempt to contribute in-

formation complementary to the discovery.

b.

Original research work done by Cuban personnel advised

by foreign scientists.

This work is directed torards

(1) the attainment of

results of international

tance to be used in propaganda praising castro anor-

education system, and (2) the achievement of discoveries

•In applied science that would serve either as an econ-

omic saving or to earn foreign exchange.

As of rid.

January 68, CNIC research projects had produced nothing

of scientific

importance.

During the first half of 67,

Fidel Castro ordered the CNIC. to orient all its re-

search projects towards production technology so that

the foreign exchange invested in the projects could be

partially recovered through improved production.

7.

Department of Biochemistry. The most important of the

CNIC departments is the Department of Blochemistry; it occupies

several new buildings and former private homes.

Dr. Mora (fnu), a Chilean microbiologist.

It is headed by

This department was

conducting research on polarimetry, enzymology, spectograply,

and the synthesis of a steroid hormone fron stigmasterol, a

sugar-cane by product.

As of mid-January 1968, all attempts to synthesize a

steroid hormone from stigmasterol had failed and will almost

surely continue to fall because stigmasterol is in inert

steroid lacking in biological activity.

centrifuges then available.

Its hasic function is the analysis

or separation of the diverse elements that constitute a bio-

logical substance.

11.

Department of Electroni Microscopy.

This department. was

functioning in November

7967 and contained two election micro-

scopes of the highest quality, one Polish-made and the other

believed to be Japanese.

It was performing research in cytology.

ultrastructure (the :ltronioroscopic structure of tissues of

living beings), crystallography,

and the three-dimensional

spatial structure of certain biological substances.

12. DEpartment of Medical Botany. This departuent is headed

by a very intelligent and cultured Spanish agronist named

Guillermo Cid who has been in Cuba since 1940.

It is cifecting

a systematic study of Cuban flora in order to deterine the

pharmacological and therapeutical properties of Cuban plants.

The department works in coordination with the experimental

station in Santiago de las Vegas that is directed by the chinent

92-year old Di. Juan Tomas Roig Mesa, who is the greatest Cuban

expert on Cuban and tropical Tlora and one of the greatest

authorities in the world on medicinal plants.

In addition, the

department has the cooperation.of all the experimental agion-

omical stations in Cuba, which send the department samples of

any plant considered worth investigation;

the department con-

ducts an exhaustive analysis of such samples.

The research has

two objectives:

The utilization of the curative properties of the

plants,

which constitute a cheap supply of national

raw materials and can replace many imported pro-

ducts.

b. The launching on the world market of competitive

pharmaceutical products, following the example

of Red China and Bulgaria.

The work of the Department of Medical Botony will pro

bably be successful because of (a) the qualifications and com-

petence of its director, Guillermo Cid, (b) the extraordinary

impulse that has been imparted to its research program, and

(c) the extraordinary richness of Cuban flora in medicinal plants

Department of Microbilogy and Virology. This depart

very well equipped and manned.

It has ultracentrifuges

and isolated installations for virus cultures, and installations

for experimental

animals.

15.

Biomechanics and Biomedical Studies.

Biomechanics is

the study of the biological activity of living

organisns from

the point of view of the physicochemical laws that govern them.

As of September 1966, a department that would do research

on bio

mechanics was being organized within the CNIC.

The Cuban Govern-

ment is aware of the enormous medical importance

of the appli-

cation of cybernetics (problem solving by electronic computers)

to the analysis, organization, and resolution of the very complex

physicochemical problems that

the biology of living beings pre--

sents; the Government is attempting to organize this department,

which

will train highly qualified personnel and import clectronic

computers (a) for the study of the complex. physicochemical pro-

blens relnted principally to hematology,.

neurophysiology, and

cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, and (b) for the couputa-

tion for public health purposes of. the vast anounts of public-

health data of different types that the MINSAP region organi-

zations would

provide.

variations in the biological parameters from the biochemical

and hemodynamic point of view during cardiovascular surgery

and in physiological research related to the cardiovascular ap-

paratus.

In neurophysiology. and neuropharmacologys.the re-

search projects would be oriented towards research

on higher

nervous activity including electrical modifications produced

in higher nervous activity; in hematology, the projects would

be oriented towards the study of isoimmunization and patho-

logical alterations of the different blood cells.

The elcctron

ic computers

would be needed to process the immense quantities

of data such research would produce.

explained by the fact thal

first train personnel in the higher methods of scientific

research, and such training requires years of effort.

The few

persons prepared to do important rescarch are at the present

time occupied in the administrative and pedagogical organization

of the CNIC and cannot work full-time as researchers.

19.

In 1960, Dr. Jose Antonio

Padron, an eminent research scientist,

began

work. on the isola

tion and culture of antibiotic substances, the study of theii

properties, and experimentation with said

substances; he ini.

tiated this work at the Oncological Hospital but is now a CNIC

collaborator.

As of December 1967; he had isolated and exhaus-

tively studied 89 new antibiotics,

many of which are too toxic

for human use. His work demonstrates his great ability and

perserverance, and with the material resources of the CNIC at

his disposal, should result in discoveries of scientific im

portance.

CNIC Training Program

Doctor

The CNIC offers a three-

to the degree of Doctor of Basic

Sciences for which program fifth-year medical students with

exceptional

academic standing can qualify if (a) during their

colleg. career they have shown special aptitudes for teaching

and research, (b) the UJC gives them an "A" grade in political

standing or reliability, and (c) they

are cleared by a DSE

Investigation.

In 1966,

of the students then in the fifth

ycar

program; all were

of medical schopellent students and UC members and are

only six were accepted by this trainag

now medical doctors:

Ramon Ortiz, Rosa Elena Simeon, Ismael

Claik. Arce, Hilda Donderis, Julio

Rolriguez Docad, and his

wile Suira (Inu).

, As of April 1968, probably no more than 30

students were studying in this training program, chiefly be-

cause of the rigorous entrance requirements.

During the first year of the three-year program, the

students, all

of thon are medical docto's,

study (a) sathe-

natics: mathematical analysis (higher algebra), analytiçal

scoretry, and tripononetry; (u) physics: acchanics (kinematics,

statics,

and dynanies), nechanics of liquids and gases, and

heat; (c) chemistry;inorganic and organic; (d) languages

casion, Gibaish, Prench, or German); dialectical and histori-

cal naterialism; and logic of science.

The classes occupy

both mornings and afternoons and include seminars given by

the professors in blen rotation system, the studunts also

give seminars

specific medical speciality selected by

the

individual

In addition, the students serve as

instructors of biochemistry, physiology, etc., at the Victoria

de Giron premedical school.

23.

each student (a) continues to

serve as an instructor at the Victoria de Giron premedical

school,

(b) continues to study in his own specialty, such as

biochemistry, neurophysiology, electronic microscopy, genetics,

virology, etc., (c) undertakes an original research project

under the guidance of a professor who is usually a foreigne iti

writes a thesis based on: the research project, presents

and defends it before a tribunal,

and (e) completes an examina-

tion in the specialty he has chosen.

If the thesis is approved

and the student passes the examination in his specialty, he

receives the title of Doctor of Basic Sciences and either becomes

'member of the faculty of one of the three Cuban medical

schools (Paragraph 5. b.above) or stays on at the CNIC as a

research assistant.

During the first year, students receive 225 Cuban

pesos monthly.

second year they receive 250 pesos

monthly, and during the third year they receive 300 pesos

monthly.

In addition, the students receive a free lunch and

supper daily.

In late 1968;

the CNIC will graduate its first two

Doctors of Basic Sciences:

Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, M.D..

studied in France, and Morlan (fnu), who studied

both will remain at the CNIC after graduation and do research

in biochemistry.

26.

Doctor of Pure Sciences. Candidates for the CNIC

training program Teading to the degree of Doctor of Pure

Sciences must satisfy requirements similar to those described

in paragraph 20 above:

candidates must be outstanding students

in one of the pure sciences (chemical, physical, mathematical,

or biological sciences) who, throughout their entire college

career have deronstrated special aptitudes for teaching and

scientific research, and

who are Communist sympathizers approved

by the UJC.

sity Medical School.

Students wishing to study medicile or

stomatology at Havana University must study first two years

as boarding students at the Victoria de jiron Insijlute.

Neither Santiago de Cuba nor Santa Clara has a similar insti-

tute.

28.

As of September 1967, students from Las Villas,

Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces who desire to enter medical

school as first-jear students must matriculate at either

Santa Clara or Santiago de Cuba University; this measure was

put into effect in order to reduce congestion at Havana Uni

versity.

Nacional Research Institutes

29.

The following National Research Instiutes, organized

by medical specialties, work in coordination wit: the

CNIC but

are subordinate

to the MINuP.

All were organized as "insti-

tutes" during the first three

months of 1967, although some had

been functioning for years under different names.

All are

clinical research institutes that work prinarily with palients.

Each institute controls all the hospital departents throughout

Cuba that correspond to the specialty of the institute.

FOr

example:

The Endourinology Institute controls all the

hospital

departments of endocrinology in Cuba.

30.

Endocrinology Institute. The Endocrinology Institute

replaced the former Institute for Endocrinological Research

that was founded and directed by Dr. Yamil Kouri.

The insti-

tute is located at the same site as

the former institute: the

ground flour of the leit wing of the Fajardo Hospital, Havana

City.

It is headed by Dr. Oscar Mateo de Acost:, M.D., Cuba's

most eminent endocrinologist.

Dio Mateo is extraordinarily

intelligent, a university professor and PCC member, and is one

of the scientific bulwarks of the Castro Regime.

assistants include Dr.. Catalina Eibenschuz, who is married lo

of the CNIC Department of Biochemistry, and

was studying endocrincology in France in early €8; Dr. Bario-

lome Arce; who studied in Rumania and was studying in France.

in early 68; and a young medical doctor named Oriedo (inu),

who was probably to be sent to Sweden to study.

The Endocrinology Institute enjoys a large budget

because of Dr. Mateo's scientific eminence and political

"virtues".

It has excellent equipment for electrophoresis,

ultracentrifuges, and photocolorimeters.

Nephrology Institute.

The Nephrology Institute is

located on the TiTth loor of the Joaquin Albarran Clinical-

Surgical Hospital, Avenida 26 at Avenida Rancho Boyeros,

lenatology Instilute.

The Hematology Institute

has

departnents at the lilliat Soler Hospital,

the Fajardo

Hospital, and the National Hospital, all located in Havana

City.

The institute has no building of its own and its

activities are located at-the three best hematological clinics

in Cuba, as enumerated above.

The Director of the Hematology

Institute ia Dr. Eduardo de la Torre, who is

Department of llenatology, William Soler Hospital.

(inu), who is probably Cuba's best hematologist,

the Department of Hematology of the Fajardo Hospital.

36.

The most important research project of the Hematology

Institute was

initiated about july 66 and

consisted of the

study of the "atilization of isoniazida in the treatment of

Verholf's (as received) discase a purpura trombopenica idio-

patica." The value of isoniazida in the treatment of herlolf's

disease was discovered by chance under the following circum-

stances:

A clild hospitalized in the hematological department

ol the William Soler hospital for treatmont of Werholf's dis-

ease contracted a primary tuberculosis infection: when this

infection was treated with isoniazida. the symptom-complex of

Werholf's disease disappeared completely and no relapse occur-

red:

As of January 1968, 22 such cases had been studied and the

conclusions

were being prepared for presentation at a Renato-

logical Congress; the biological nechanism of the treatent had

not yet been determined, but it was considered that the experi

mental stage had been completed.

37..

Dra

Eduardo de la Torre was performing research -

principally of a statistical nature - on leucemias.

Infantile

leucemia was being studied at the William Soler Hospital and

at the Angel Arturo Aballi Children's Hospital, located in

Arroyo Naranjo, liavana; this research followed

the treatment

scheme of Swelzer and the University of California scheme

known internationally as V.A.M.P.

38.

Gastroenterology Institute.

The Gastroenterology

Institute occupies the ino-story building at the Calixto Garcia

Hospital which was formerly occupied by the hospital library.

Its Director is Dr. Raimundo Llanio Navarro, who was brought

to world-wide eminence when he presented his study "Colangio-

grafia Laparoscopica en la Lactante" at the Brussels Congress

in 1965.

When the Gastroenterology Institute was officially

established in early 1967, it had been functioning for about

two years.

In January 1967, Dr. Humberto Rodriguez Hidalgo and

Dr. Mirna Quintero were admitted as residents;

their adaission

as

residents coincided with the establishment at the institute.

WESTERN EUROPENAN AFFAIRS, THE RECENT PURGE BY FIDEL CASTRO OF

A NUMBER OF OLD-GUARD COMMUNISTS, INCLUDING ALIBAL ESCALANTE,

SETHSEN CUBA AND THE USSR, AS NUMEROUS DIFFERENCES OF VIEWS

HAVE EXISTED FOR SOME TIME AND ARE WELL KNOWN. THESE DIF-

THAT THE USSR CANNOT GO BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT IN ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL MEASURES DESIGNED TO PRESSURE HIM TO FOLLOW A POLICY

MORE IN AGREEMENT WITH SOVIET INTEREST. HE CONTINUES TO GIVE

OPE: SUPPORT TO ARKED STRUGGLES IN LATIN AMERICA, SUCH AS

IN COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO

SOVIET POLICY. THIS POLICY OF INDEPENDENCE HAS WON CASTRO

Dear Dr. Bustamante:

I have

recently completed a reading of your

paper enticled "Cultural Pactors in Hysterlas with

Schizophrenie Clinical Pictures." I found it to be

of great intereat and I appreclate your sending it

to me. I have been working with Dr. Willian Wolf

on

the projection of medical education and psychiatry

as they are likely to be in the next century.

The

first of a sertes of articles and of a monograph,

was published in the April 1966 jesue of the American

Journal of Psychotherapy.

This takes in a great deal

of analysis that would be included under transcultural

psychiatry.

Indeed, we are using the systems analysia

approach which, of course, must take lato account the

broad psychosocial and socioeconomic forces that in-

fluence the psychodynamice matrices in Individuals.

I am Interested in the particular securittee that are

precipitated in the ego atructure of individuals by

the very nature of the socioeconomic, sociopolitical

and sociophilosophic system in which the individual

Lives: In an opposite vein, ve are interested in the

stresses that are placed upon the individual by vari-

ous social systens from individual and practical stand-

points.

Awarenesses such as these should be of belp

in the planning of social systems for underdeveloped

nations.

While this seems like a very ambitious con-

ceptualization,

I do not believe that it is an unlikely

possibility. in

the coming generations.

I look forward to receive the copy of your

book "Psicologia Medica", Volume 1. 'I believe that the

outline as you presented

it to me seens very inclusive.

Just todey I recoived the 1966 Report on lot1vities of the Inter

national Commitsee Against Mental linese,

Faken durias the lunneon in Madrid, for which i thant you.

I got the ploture

Reading the Report I notioed there 1o a Bulletin de Centre de

Paychiatrie et de Neurologie 1n Raiti.. I would like to receive copy

or copies of numbera that have already appeared.

I do not know dractly

whore to urite, or to whom address the letter, so will you kindly take

care of thia for me.

A180, I am Interested in the International Journal of Paychlatry

published

in Boston, which I would like to receive too.

You could give

thea my name with the Inatitute address ao they can send me the copies.

to both these Reviews you can tell them that since I am Director of

both the bulletin of the Institute and the new Review of Iraneoultural

Paychiatry I an officially proposing an exchange for the's Review, or

o1oe they can tell me what they want me to do.

Inoldentally, I elab to call your attention to the fact that the:

Institate'a name

now 1e Instituto de Neurofialologia y Peicologia, not

•Inatituto de Investigaziones de la Actividad Nerviosa Superior, as the

aforementioned Report was addreased:

The address was correct, Long y

37, Altures del Vedado, Havana, Cuba.

I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. D. Iaiga,

Secretary to the World Psychlatric Association and among other things

I Indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section of Trans-

cultural Psychiatry within the World Peychiatric Association because

this la a rather new and multi disciplinary fleld (comprising psychta»

anthropologiats, etc..requiring more-than an

other one the cooperation eat meet feelitate the efforts to kee

producing and offering contributions in the development of thia field.

I have secured a better way to got our mail and it consioto of

the following:

address your envelope

to Laboratorios Brba,

Apartade

Once they oper

the 1. ter a 21, it is edice ed to let me ber of the laboratore

will bring 1t personally to me as they travel back and forth between

our countries.

I will address my letters to you and they will mail

them in Mexico to you.

In thie way, we are both sure our nail will

not get loat since I have absolute confidence in them..

an taking thie opportunity to send you my book, "Medical Peycho

Logy", in three volumes of which thie 1s Vol.

I think I have covered everything of interest to you.

Hoping to hear fron you soon, and with best wishes, I am,

The examinations are highly cun-

could be published in Cuba.

the information and forwarded it to Cuba.

do la sedicina en Cuba hasta el 30 do ¿bril de 1967, es decir ha podido co

nocer también ol desenvolvimiento de la medicina cubana durante el régimon

castro-comunista. Siendo lo que a continuación expreso un enjuicianiento

del mismo en su triple aspecto docento, profesional y clasista.

Aspecto docente.

La Universidad de la Habana fué fundada en el año 1728 y fueron precisarente

los estudios médicos los primeros en ser organizados coro Facultado Si ol pa-

gedo puede venagloriarse de haber sido cuna de dos nombres preclaros en la Hia-

toria de la l'edicins, cono son Tomás EOlAY, sabio introductor de la vacura er.

•Cuba 5 el DI. Carlos J. FIFLAY, genial descubridor del agente transmisor de la

fiebre amarilla, En la época republicana adquirió justa lana por la caliana de

eus profesores, la rigidez de sus planes de estudio y la brillantez de sus gra-

duados.

Pero no es el momento de citar nonbres que justifiquen tales encvera-

OjOnos. Basta decir tan solo que la Facultad de ledicina, precisamento, estaba

clasificada coro l-l en el ranking de las facultades similares del irundo artero,

al Igual que las mejores univernidades de los Estados Unidos de América.

Con el advenimierto del régimen commista de Fidel CASTRO, comenzó la dasintegra-

ción de la Universidad de la Habana, para volverla a integrar, como une rueda Iã»

er.-le irmensa maquinaria comunista del Gobierno. Siendo precisamente: : raculie.

de Medicina la prinera en ser atacada, alegando diversos pretextos de indoio se-

cundaria, lo que trajo coro consecuencia le renuncia de la mejor parte de su pro

Pesorado. Con la emigración de los médicos cubanos casi en mesa, que repuliaban

el régiren totalitario y tiránioo que se instauraba en la Isla, agudizániose la

carencia de profesores en la Facultad de L'edicina®

Modo de resolver esta erare problema que se le creaba al régimen de Caste.

Sa primer lugar nombrano profesores de "dado", es decir que nurca hiciero. mim

autoridades comunistes cubanas que dirigen la salua pública. En segundo lugar,

importanio profesionales extranjeros de Faises Comunistas o Socialistas, o bien

de Países Denocráticos, pero que son militantes

o simpatizantes ocultos de 1oa

partidos comunistas loceles. Todos estos profesionales son habilitados innodia-

tamento, incluso para ejercer la prolesión médica, por un simple decrato recto-

ral.

Así como un exámen isparcial de este proresorado, nos pernite afiruar su baja

calidad, y por una razón my sercilla; por ser todos con rarísimas excepciones

profesores improvisados, sin ninguna historia o experiencia médica pedagógioa.

•Y aquollos rarísimos, repetimos, que pueden poseer alguna, por haber sido ante-

tiormente profesores de le facultad, no tienen la libertad de enseñanza propia

del caráctar liberal de la l'edicina, sino que están sujetos a la férrea discipl1-

na colectiva propia de los sistecas marxistas-leninistas.

Del alumnado puede decirse sin exageración alguna, que es el más malo en 1s largs

historia de la ya bi-centenaria Universidad de la Fabana Como lo qué se quiere

obtener es un tipo de médico político, clego observante de las roglas comuristas

poco importa la preparsción sédica de los alumnos."' Si antiguamente se raquerian

T años de Escuela Primaria y 4 O 5 de Bachillerato, hoy cualquiera, con ui simple

elanar, las más de las veces arañado, puede hacer su ingreso en los estudios mã

dicos sin haber cursido cingún $ipo de preparación en la Primera o Segu da Enser.-

fensa, lo que ai se exige es una militancia activa dentro de los cuadros del Per-

tido Comunista Cutano, es decir, que no estudia en la Facultad de ledicina, el que

quiere o tiene vocación por estos estudios, para ello hay que demostrar de un modo

fehaciente la vinculación al regimen. Y ouando se tiene sospecha de una tula ad-

hesión por cualquiera de los alumos, irmediatamente se celebre una "Asaablea de

depuración", en la que 99 venes de cade 100 es erpulsado aquel que tenga la liala

suerte de ser señalado por aug corpaieros, en defiritiva, que la clásica y culisa-

grada libertad de erseianza es un mito en el réginen comunista curano.

En algunas asténetwas no existen las pruebas de capacidad generalmente acep

tadas por todas las universidades del mundo, es decir el exámen, bien de tipo

u otro. Puos en el afán de graduar médicos con el fin de poder reemplazar. inu-

tilmento a la grar masa de profesionales emigrados, las notas se dan for sisple

asistencia a clases, hay que graduar médicos a toda costa, dicen loa dirigertea

ormunistas y para que se vea hasta dorde llegan en este sentido, vaya la sizuier

tA anécdota vivida por el DI. BEATO, la cual refleja con exactitud esta gran

preocupación de los jorarcas del régimen. Se trata de un antiguo alumno de lE

época pre-comunista, que cuando CASTRO se apodera del poder, lo faltaban pocas

Asignaturas para greduarse de médico. Cono es un cubano demócrata, aprobó to-

das menos una, que no quiso examinar, para no coger el título de médico bajo el

réginen comunista, cosa que repugnaba a su conciencia, pero cuando los dirigente:

do su curso le apremiaron para que se examinara, so pena de ser expulsado ai no

•Lo hacía, no tuvo más remedio que hacerlo, pero buscó adrede el suspenso, con

testando mai®

la casi totalidad del exámen, a pesar de esto, y de hacer malisi-

mamente el exámen, fué aprobado. He aquí la nueva versión del castro comunista,

de hacer médicos a palos.

En el plan de estudios médicos, existe una asignatura "Marxiano" que es indis-

poneable para continuar le carrera. El alumo que no posea el aprobado en la

misma, jamás será médico, no importa que sea brillante en Patología o Terapéuti-

ca, Jamás obtendrá el título mientras no se haga un alumno aventajado en esa

asignatura. Aai que lo que se quiere obtener por el régimen es un tipo de mé-

dico político, que responda siempre a las orientaciones de la dirigencia coru

nista y no a los cánones sagrados del clásico arte de curar.

Todas estes cosas han dado origen a un tipo especial de medico, que el pueblo

cubano le ha dado a la broma y le conocen con la denominación genérica de "oir-

co picos", porque la prueba final, la gran prueba, la que los consagra anta lou

quino", la nortaia más alta de la Isla. Esto que parece escapado de la mor-

to de un alierado es lo que exige CúIRO, para que un médico se gradúo, no

importa que el alumno tenga una gran vocación por los estudios médicos, no

importa que baya demostrado su capacidad en la materia que son propias de la

L'edicina, si no tiene aptitudes de alpinista o no quiere hacer la gran esca-

lade, no se gradua y lo obtiene el título. Por estas razones, se podrá ot

servar del tenos casi sagrado con que son mirados estos médicos denominados

"cinco picos"

por la población cubana, que con razón los desprocia y que jus

bajadores, médicos y no médicos•

Las medicinas son pocas y malas, el Ministerio de Salud Pública, envia a todor

los profesionales cada dos meses, una listica cada vez menguante, de los nadi-

camentos que pueden obtenerse y que contados por el entrevistado no pasan de

700 productos. El avance de la Terapéutica, que día a día está registrado par

la prensa médica mundial, no se conoce en Cuba, cuyos médicos se ven oblizado::

métodos de exploración radiológicas, como son las coleciatografias y pit-

logratias, son nuy difíciles de hacer por la falta de los medios de cons

traste adeouados.

Las consultas privadas están llamadas a desaparecer en el rézimen cocunista

según ya proclaran a todos los vientos, los jerarcas del gobierno y por una

razón muy sencilla; porque, las consideran centros de competencia a la redi-

cina oficial, pues todavia el médico privado a pesar de todoa l08 costáculoa

se esfuerza en dar al paciente una medicina de calidad superior a la que ea-

te encuentra en los Centros Hospitalarios y asistenciales del Réginen.

Aspecto clasista:

Los médicos cubanos, como clase hablan llegado a una organización nocio an

su género, que fué copiada y sirvió para organizarse a nuches instituciones

similares de otros paises, tal era

el Colegio Médico Haoional (antizus reio

ración lédica de Cuba) que agrupaba bacie el año 1959 unos 7,000 médicos ou

banos. Asi cono bajo su actuación se obtuvieron una serie de conquistas la-

• borales y un ansiado Retiro ledico para la hora del desoanso y de la veje%.

Habla un Código de Moral Médica y funcionsba dentro del Colegio, una serie de

¡ribunales de Disciplina, que valaban por el estrioto cumplimiento réuico, as

decir agrupaciones con criterios disímiles en cuanto a la orientación de la

medicina cono clase, independientes de todo lo que significara militancia ao-

tiva dentro de la politica nacional.. La dirigencia colegial se elogía a tra

vés de elecciones devócráticas, en las que participan todos los médicos, ro

partiéndose los puestos ejecutivos de acuerdo con la representación proporcio-

nal de cada partido. Es decir que cono en toia organización denocrática, ha-

bie una mayoría que gobernabe y una minoría alerta y vigilante a cualquier

transgresión de las leyes colegiales.

Todo esto ha despparacido desde el nes da Abril de lydó, en que el réglio de

un plumazo, todas nuestras reivindicaciones, muchas de las cuales estaban

regadas con la sangre y el sacrificio de muchos de nosotros.

En, au lugar

existe hoy en día un régimen de trabajo esclavo, que no admite méritos y

capacidad en el orden profesional, sino una oiega obediencia a los princi

pios b'arzista-Leninista, Habiéndone enterado por amigos colegas de la pro

fesión, de que en el mes de Enero o Febrero de 1967, apareció en la escuela

actual de Medicina una lista completa de todos 103 médicos cubanos que han

tomado el Foroigi-Board en Florida, U.S.A. y sus correspondientes calificacio

nos. Mesconociendo como una cosa tan privada ha sido poaible de que se pudier

se publicar"en Cuba, aiendo las causas de que entre el sector médico, exista

al recelo de hablar al ver que cosas confidenciales cono son esos exámenes,

puedan ger publicadas en Cuba, por lo que se piensa en la infiltración comu-

nista dentro de dicho organiano.

A mediados del mes de Marzo de 1967, ouando me dirigía al Arohito Hacional,

el cual se encuentra ubicado en la Calle de Compostela y San Isidro er la Ha-

bana, para realizar estudios de investigaciones históricas de la Vedicina gu-

bana, adonde todes los días solía ir, pues en uno de esos días al salir de di-

•cho Archivo Nacional y tratar de touar la Ave. del Puerto para ir al british

Club, que se enouentra en Prado, pude observar de que dicha Ave. estuvo inte-

rrumpida el tránsito durante varios días, no recuordo días exacto, pero si aé

que un solo día extremaron la vigilancia en el puerto, además de no peruitir

que se acercase nadio, logrando ver desde los muelles de la Terminal del Ferry

Habana-Cayo Hueso y a una distanoia de unos 50 a 100 mts. camiones y rastras

cargando objetos de toda clase de tamaños, éstos objatos eran de madera y que-

didas anteriores son aproximadas, ya que no lo recuerdo con lujo de detalles,

por ser vista a ojo de aguila y a la distancia antes mencionada. También pu-

tos tamaños, pareciéndono el menor de ellos como de unos 55 galones. Siendo

todo cuanto puedo precisar al respecto.
