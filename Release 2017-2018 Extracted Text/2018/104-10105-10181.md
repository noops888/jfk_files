arrived in the U.8.

However, he became the fRiTE RkVOl

until the FID conced to function.

tue to me the predecossor

of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organined und

supported by the Agency.

The organtation me red do

front for recruitment of Brigade 8506 for the levasion.

During this perfod ARCACHA reported to the FID headquaftere

roportedly maintained entensive rolatione with the How

Orlenn FBI and Immigrution offices. To of his regular

8. ARCACHA me also one of the promoters of the

FRISNDS OF DENOCRATIC CUBA, INC FC) which us Incorporated

In Hew Orleans on 6 Janury 1961. This organtention me

ostensibly created by several New Orleans business and

politeal figures, Including the decensed former FBI agent,

buy tantater, to collect noney to asd com in their

fight aguinat communies, According to the artle es of

Incorporation, these donations would also be used to support

the IRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,

less a percentage to be rotalned by the IC. An Investi

sation conducted by a rollable lian Station asnet concluded

that the FDC was organtzed strictly for the personal ein

of the promoters with the approval and collabortion of

ARCACHA.

The investigation produced no evidence that any

Individual dontions were ever solleited or received and

recomended that the funds of the Stevedores Unton and the

booke of the Ney Orlenng Exporters Compny be Investigated

for evidence of personal sala and possible evidence of

federal tas evalon, since both the president of the New

Orleans Exporters Company, Gerrl F. Tungue, and the Chlof

of New Orleans Stevedores Unton, Alfred Chittenden, were

officials of the FDC.

Approximately one month after the

FDC was created, strong critician fron some prominent Cubans

put the organtention out of businese.

FRENTS REVOLICIONARIO DE OCRATICO (FRD)

(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRONT)

1. The IRD was created with Agency assistance,

guidance and financial support in lay 1960 and consister

of several anti-CASTRO sroupE.

The Tho was forned as a

political action, propaganda and uilitary unit.

Initial

actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,

demonstrations, and tripe throughout the Hemisphere to galn

support for the fight against CAsTro.

The IRD also functioned

as the front organization for recruiting the membere of

the Bay of Pige invasion force and carried out a massive

progran of social assistance to Brigade 8506 members in

training camps and their fanilies. Although the FRD head

quarters vere baged in Miaml, delegates were assigned to

other arens which included New Orleans, Loulsiana, Tampa,

Florida, and Mexico City, to gather intelligence and

coordinate Cuban refugee

activities.

2.

In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL (CHC) was formed to coordinate and direct FRD

actlultles and this group was headed by Agency and White

House sponsored Dr. Jose HIlD Cardons, assisted by Manuel

ARTIME and Dr. Antonio VARONA.

Both the IRD and the GRo

continued to function until October 1961 when the IRD was

completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion

resulting fron duplication of personnel, activities and

funding.

The CHC also had direct access to President

Kennedy and top White House aides.

bacause of the menttude

of the FRD and CAC operations and the Agency participation

In the activities and funding of the groups, a large number

Of JWAVE and Headquarters were directly Involved with both

IRD and CHC personnel.

THR IUFORMATION COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS, INC. (INCA)

1. INCA 1e an anti-Communist propaganda organization

with headquarters in New Orleans, that diaseminates Engllah

and foreign language propagand tapes and 11lms on « vorld

SCHICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An INCA letterhead 11sting all

the officers and offlotale has been requented fron dlavs,

which has had some casual correspondence ulth the organial-

tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO.

There to no indieation of any Agency relatlonhip

with INCA prior to January 1985 when INCA sponsored Hen

CASTRO's appearance In New Orleans. At that time an Agoney

sponsored by INCA. The dinner, which was attended by civle

Loaders and representatives of all news media, took place

shortly after Misg CASTRO's defection and there vas

considerable interest in her appearance. INCA was particularly

Interested since it had distributed hundreds of Engllsh

and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when

she was surfaced In Mexico. In October 1960 INCA agin

requested that MIss CASTRO appear as a guest spoaker In

major Anerican cities In connection with the release of

the INCA motion picture production "HITLER IN HAVANA".

Following various reviews of the film, JWAVE decided the

f1lm would probably become controversial and 1t vould be

Anadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the Invitation.

Because of INCA's extremet political orientation, davi

bas wanted to avoid any more Involvement between MiSS CASTRI

and INCA and the Station asset, In his capacity naL

has managod to prevent this.

There has been only

one casual contact betwoen our asset and Bduard BUTL3s,

Executive Vice- President of INCA, since Miss CASTRO'& 1965

New Orleans trip.

This took place recently when BUTLER was

In the area promoting the "HITLER IN HAVANA" 11lm.

According to JWAVE, INCA officiale have never

Indicated In any way that they are aware of Agency control

and direction of Miss CASTRO or

and there

18 no indication that INCA officials have had any official

contact with Agency officers.

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)

(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. The DRE was conceived, created and funded by the

Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966.

It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba

which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO.

Many of the leaders came into exile around September 1960

and were subsequently trained and infiltrated Into Cuba

by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtain

1ng Intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through

the Bay of Pigs invasion.

while the DRs

was initially set

up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a

large amount of paramilitary aid in funds and material.

After the Bay of Pigs, the DRE engaged in independent

military actions which declined at Agency direction and

because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 unt11 ter

1pte then

mination of the group. Members were used through 1966 as

political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout the Hemisphere, attending international

student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio

programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2.

After the cutback in military operations, my

of the

best DRE members relocated in other areas.

present there are delegations in most Latin American coun

tries which have maintained some contact with various

with several JWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.

However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact

with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel

SALVAT, the current DRE Secretary General who is now

operating a bookstore in Miami, Florida, and Fernando

GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador.
