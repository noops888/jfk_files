Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

“L CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A.. Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
Deg 1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
ss personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,
13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective.

a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example,
operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair
safes. Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this information in another manner,

b. SCANTLING is still the Station’s primary source for
keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK

ersonnel in Mexico City, This is accomplished in several ways;
2 most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
eads which indicate the LIMERICK peopie are interested in
renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal
request for additional details).

2, "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets
of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING is very useful for coilecting
information on other Station targets:

a, On the basis of a request to the Station from the
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO
demonstrations, Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired
information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at L000 hrs., 5 June 1961.
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

b, SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

c, SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and associates,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances,"" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below:

a,’ SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the

surveillance and attempted recruitment of a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy. SCANTLING
talked witH everal times and undoubredly was.

arily responsible for the later success of the recruitment
made ‘by another Station agent,

b, Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in Sebruary 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. - See
the last renewal for addirional details on this case,

c. In connection with the above objective SCANTLING
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations
for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local

investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE
components,

d. SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is considered sufficiently related to mention here,

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,
SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
Station, For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and
will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962. Also,
during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance
team until July 1961 when Simon D, CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
for other Station operations,

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured
against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project
LIEMPTY.

B, Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

sl, “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
persomel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses,"
Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting che usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how 'y contribute
to the above objective, There has been no change in the coverage as
described in the i960 Request for Project Renewal.

2, “To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining ro Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is stiil the major contributor to this

objective. In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four
months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation, For
several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded
from the LIENTRAP vehicle, Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base,

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.,
rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances_""
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.

4, The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile, The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued.

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so, The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
information in support of other Station operations,

CHANGES

‘There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project
‘ept that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)

survei!lance team injiily 196! in accordance with previous plans.

tm, EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made in Section IM of last year's project renewal request.

Iv. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which
was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused
any known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736,: the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be
ever alert for any musual incidents which might indicate that the base has been
‘compromised. This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project
during the past project year,

VG PLANS

The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year, Rather, efforts will be
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational
arrangements.

Vi. COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended $21, 458,00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00. It is anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500. 00,. or some $12, 500,00
under the budget estimate of $53, 000, 00.

B. .Ensuing Period - Of the total $49, 500, 00 budget, itemized-below,
$29, 500,00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the
balance, $20, 000,00 should be expénded during Fiscal Year 1963, Normal accounting
procedures will be used for all expenditures,
