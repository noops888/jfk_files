Cc,
Qs sea that from 10/27/58 until 11/4/58,
| FIORINI ered at the Bel Sol Apartments in Mexico
City and gave his U. S. address as being 422 Glen Ridge

,Road, Key Biscayne, Florida. He also was registered at the

K) Hotel Statler in Mexico City and gave his U.S. address

Aas bein 10 N.E. h Street, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

S\ ated that. ecent newspaper article in the Mexico
emoon paper, "Ultimas Noticias" had published a :

i photograph of FRANK FIORINI standing on some of the graves

ig of BATISTA followers who had been executed by the triumphant

FIDEL CASTRO RUZ” revolutionaries. Ku

ated that CIA sources had advised that
FIORINI 0 be a "New York Italian gangster type"
who spoke only broken Spanish and with what appeared to
be an Italian accent, eu

i Inquiry at the Office of the Federal Attorney
General, Mexico, D. F., developed information to the effect
that all investigation in this case was conducted by the
i osecutive and judicial authorities at Morelia, Michoacan,
Ite view of the fact that investigative informants of this
office have considerable difficulty in checking official
records in the State of Michoacan, any effort to take this
action has been delayed until it is possible for this
investigation to be conducted by personnel of this office
or an investigative informant who has adequate credentials
for that purposes] Nu)

From the foregoing data concerning FIORINI, it
appears that he is probably identical with subject FRANK
ANTHONY STURGIS. . It also appears possible, in view of
FIORINI's reported presence in Cuba, the question of his
identity may already have been fully clarified.

LEAD

' MEXICO CITY

At MEXICO, D. F._ AND MORHLIA, MICHOACAN
, Will explore the possibilities of obtaining the
i: fi results of interviews of FIORINI by Mexican authorities and

any information which can be obtained concerning the outcome
of the arrest of FIORINI and the group of Cubans.
