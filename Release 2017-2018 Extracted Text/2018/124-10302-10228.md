Inquiry at the Office of the Federal Attorney

General, Mexico, D. F, developed information to the effect

that all investigation in this case was conducted by the

prosecutive and juaicial authorities at Morelia, Michoacan.

In view of the fact that investigative informants of this

action has been delayed until it is possible for this

investigation to be conducted by personnel of this office

or an investigative informant who has adequate credentials

for that purpose.

From the foregoing data concerning FIORINI, it

appears that he is probably identical with subject FRANK

FIORINI'S reported presence in Cuba, the question of his

identity may already have been fully clarified.
