of the following selection criteria:

(3) Citizenship

(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)
(3) Occupation.

These selection criteria may ‘be used singly or in combinations. For example,
a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities. who have been assigned the
Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY}-0rXZ. A201. personality list could also-be
prodwced of all persons who were! born in’ Germany betweén the years 1915

OL code AA. Those personalities with’an OI code other than AA and those
with no OI code. would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
persons who have not been assigned an Ol code also be included. Note also

sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OL codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO jinterest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations. y

‘A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management

patagraphi 3b below) by filling’in’ Box 13 or a’ code may be‘assigned or “added
atea later date by a Form 831 amendment, .

The 201 system has the’ capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For'example, if an Ol code has been opened for the
security service of a ceftain country a'listing may be compiled of all members
of that service,
