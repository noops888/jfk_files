1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system äre:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form

S31) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i.e., per-

sonal history, current status, and prospects:

c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and

stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

d. Main Inder Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Inder Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record; succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ret

erence consolidated.

4. CONTENTS OF THE DOSSIER

Information about a 201 personality should be filed or cross-referenced into

his dossier. When additional information is discovered on a 201 subject through

a name trace or other process, i.e., review of predecessor documents, it must

be consolidated into his personality dossier. See DOI 70-20 for consolidation

procedures.

Material which is filed in the dossier includes but is not limited to:

a. 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831).

b. Biögraphic information including photographs, fingerprints;

handwriting samples

c. Personal Record Questionnaire Parts I and IT.

d. Operational and other security approvals:

e. Name check replies, requests, clearances, and approvals.

f. Acknowledgement of pseudonym.

g. 201 personality assessments and evaluations.

h. Copy of contract and termination papers.

i. Secrecy agreement.

j. Agent Duty Status Report.

k. Training and evaluation.

?:: 1. SCSWIRL report.

m. Newspaper clippings.

n. Any information which helps provide a better understanding of the

subject and our interest in him; this may include operational reporting.

5. MAINTENANCE OF 201 DOSSIERS

Ine 201 personality dossier contains, in document date order, papers which

have been made a part of the Central Records System as tell as those which

have not. Record documents may range, frum' newspaper or magazine articles

on the subject to finance and-other administrative papers.

a Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires

discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the

simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take

place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done

periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should

be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, i.e., exact copy(s) of a document.

(2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for

the opening.

(3) All abstract slips

(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information it

a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number

then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch

coyer sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

by the Records Officer.

(S) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier

forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention

in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized

officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction

over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification

authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained

at the desk or the copy of the IS document should be removed, retained

in a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and i

cross reference sheet (Form 887) placed in the pot le givins the location

of the TS document.

dossier and separated from the basic document by the assignment of a slash

number, the attachment will be filed by the date of the basic document.

(2) Deferred documents will not be filed in a 201 dossier. If they are

to be retained in the dossier they should be sent to IP/RMS for classification

into that 201.

(3) Field inder cards (held by some desks) and area desk cards may

be retained in the 20l as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards

should be mounted on a full-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201.

(4) A 201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff

employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted-to

the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be

closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it.

(5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the trie

name 201 if one exists or converted to the true name

(6) Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest

should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material

has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified

to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IP/AN):

(7) Any document with a predecessor organization cover sheet or an

OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archives and

Disposition Section (IP/ARD) must be returned to IP/ARD for processing

(8) Desk memoranda (with or without a document source number)

containing substantive or derogatory information on the subject of the 201

should be sent to IP/AN to be classified officially into the 201 file.

(9) An attachment which should be separated from its basic document

for inclusion in a 201 personality dossier will be forwarded with the basic

document to IP/AN for processing into the 201.

(10) To retain the P&L, RYBAT, or KAPOK sensitivity of a document

remaining in a 201 dossier being retired to Central Files, place that document

in an envelope sealed with black tape (see DOI 70-17): Any RYBAT, P&L,

or KAPOK document sent to Central Files not in a black-taped envelope will

automatically be handled as desensitized. A black taped envelope may con-

tain only one document and must be filed in chronological order within the

file. If there are numerous documents of this type the desk officer may black-

tape the entire dossier rather than individual documents (see DOI 70-10).

10. 201 MACHINE LISTINGS

Machine listings provide field stations and Headquarters desks with names

and 201 numbers in the requester's particular geographic or functional area of-

interest. If a component wishes to exclude a sensitive 201 personality from its

alphabetic, numeric, and cryptonym listings, this may be done when opening

the 201 or later by a 201 amendment. On the 201 Personality File Action Request

(Form 831) leave the country of location (Box 15) and interest desk (Box 16)

blank, use the non-country code 900 in the action box. (Box 14), and indicate

permanent charge to the responsible desk. The Only listing which will include the

201 number is the IP/20i record for the Vital Records program. 201 listings are

categorized as standard or nonstandard and as scheduled or special.

All standard listings are cumulative; previous editions must be destroyed

upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely

sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

b. Non-Standard Listings

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

(1) Country of location

(2) 01 codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation)

(3) Citizenship

(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years).

(5) Occupation.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a iser could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

OI coce of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

prodied of all persons who ivere born in Germany between the years 1915

and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the Ol code AA.

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other than AA and those

with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific

as the occupation code (Attachment 1): The occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice

some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters; bricklayers, painters, mechanics

and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category

will be included in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted

(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:

(a) Surname

(b) Given name

(c) Date of birth

(e) Citizenship

(6) OF code

ANNEX B

PERSONALITIES - 201 AND IN NUMBERS

1. A relatively small proportion of the total number of personali-

ties indexed by the CS are of active operational interest at any given

point in time. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, and members of

groups and organizations of continuing target interest. Each of these

personalities is assigned either a 201 number or an IDN number.

2. "The 201 number serves a dual purpose. It brings the files on

these personalities into the CS records system. A single number,

e.g., 201-123456, is assigned to each person, and a dossier controlled

by this number is established which contains, or has cross referenced

to it, all of the reporting on the individual's personal history, current

status and prospects. Once the 201 number is assigned, it is used in

future reporting on the individual both as a file number and in place of

other identifying data. UD-to-date machine listings are published

periodically to help hiald stations and headquarters desks keep book

on those 201 personalities falling in their particular geographic of

• functional area of interest

3.

It has becoms apparent that the 201 machine listings should in

clude the identities of persons of operational interest because of their

connection with a target group or organization eyen though there may

not be sufficieat information or specific interest to warrant opening

a tile. For chample: A considerable number of stations are concerned

with the achivities of Cuban exiles. Coverage of their movements,

factions and dojectives can he assisted by furnishing ail participating

stations up-to-nate listings containing information under the control

of the Cuban desk on the dramatis personae. In addition to 201 per-

sonalities, such lists should contain the names and identifying data

of persons who should be kept track of, although they may only be of

tangential interest or on whom there may be little or no data other

than that given in the listing itself.

To accommodate this type of requirement in the 201 system,

identifiable personalities concerning whom enough information is not

yet available to require the opening of a file may be assigned numbers

of the following type but in the same series:

IDN -123$57

These are relabeled 201 it a tue is opened.

IDN numbers are car-

ried with 201 numbers in appropriate general or special listings,

where they are identified by the letter "I" in the "Type of Name" col-

umn. IN numbers are not CS file numbers.

5. All 201 code numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters,

either upon receipt of Form 831, or of a field dispatch. It a dispatch

is written about a personality not yet in the system, a 201 number for

it may be requested simply by writing under headquarters file number

in the dispatch form as follows:

e. Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-

sonality records in

the 201 system to record the association of an individual

with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-

gence and security service affiliation, whether statt or agent, or known or

suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI

codes for use by components:

(1) general Ol codes (Attachment 4)

(2) DI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services

or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management

Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned tvo OI codes. An OI code may be assigned

when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form

831) is initiated (see

paragraph 3b below. by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added

atoa later date by a Förm 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings

personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the

security service. of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
