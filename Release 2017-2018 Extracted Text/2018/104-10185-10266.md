A meeting

was held with Ing from 2000 to 2135 hourg in Big car

(parked in Tacuba) on 26 October.

2. I-9 reported as follows:

A few days earlier Coty SOLORZAO, sister-in-law of General

Lazaro CARNAS, told 1-9 with a groan of disgust that it lcoks

11ke DIAZ Ordaz has been chosen as the PRI presidential candidate.

bo

The Ambassador is still using the wall safe built into the chimney

of his office (we have photos of this in our files). Ig thinks

that the Erbassy payroll is kept there as the other day when he

walked into the Ambassador's office he saw the Ambassador shut the

safe door - Dra. MACHIDO. was there, having just returned from the

bank where she withdrew the payroll. Dra. NACHADO handies the

payroll for the whole Erbassy.

In the old days, before CASTRO, MIRABAL worked for

the Sherwin Wililans paint factory (L9 thinks Sw in the States

must have a record on him) which was located a short distance from

the plant nined by I g's father.

1o Dra. "MOlADO recently told In9 thatxenA was discourteous to her

when she first, arrived here but that he has softened up a bit re-

cently and now seems to "accept" her.

She thinks this may be

because she lost two sons in the Revolution (no details given).

She complained that LINGOSTERA still doesn't accept her but JURRIN

seems to be coring around. (This may ba the usual resentment caused

by a female in a responsiole executive position)

INQUIN HERNANDEZ

Jo The Ambassador said at a rocent

staff mecting that he was taken

to task by a Mexican senator who asked him why Cuba refused to

sign the aton test ban pact.

MESS (he, like ROs, 1s known by

his matronynic) tried to explain that Cuba could never sign the

agreement as long as she is the subject of Aerican agression.

ARMIS said that Embassy staff people should be prepared to ansver

"such questions and menticrod diat a l'equest was being sent to

Havana to allow the expenditure of sufficient funds to print u

10,000 coples of Fidel CISTRO's speech of 28 September to be

The decision to nie B's hare

quite impressed with the many books In avidence and showed great Interest in

1. In compliance with DIR 40146, Edward D. Knapman was dispatched

Attachnent C

Operational Intelligence

8. Victor TRAPOTE Mateos - This ran's most interesting operational

access. Is througn his daughter, Irina TRIPerS de VALDES, who 1s married

to Raniro VALDES.

Tbe prospective fruitfulness of this entree dininishes,

however,

as the facts are laid on the table.

For one thing, though anti

Communist, TRAPOTE is still a friend of Fidel Castro. Ing said that be

shelterdd Fidel in his home during Fidel's exile in Medco.

TRAPCTE, who

was born in Spain, 13 about 58 and apparently more interested in his art

(sculpturing) than in politics.. TRAPTS arparently has no intention of

zoing to Cuba permanently. L9 gays TRATTS has made np corment concerning

Pariro VALDES, but he apparently has sugrested that Irina 1s not getting

along well with Raniro. I9 described TRuME as of mediun beight,

salidig built, and in good physical condition. His daughter is a tall

attractive blonde of about 25, and has a rather retiring personality.

In, could come up with no means of developing an operation against VALDES

through these entrees.

SECRET

Attachnent A

In coapliance with DIR-40146, Edward D. Knapman was dispatched

to Mexico City, from JMAVE to corduct a debriefing of LITANIL-9.

Knapnan-

orated ere to ears on a nants be he de sely and three 1963.

2.

Attachment B 1s largely positive, intelligence while Attachment C

1s basically of operational interest. The intelligence debriefirg was

conducted on the basis of current and past intellifence requirements lists

avallable at the Mexico Station.

To the extent feasible we attempted to

pinpoint ultimate sources, but headquarters will note that a sizable part of

the information provided was based on personal observation and impressions.

¡cadquarters should keep in mind that I-g's perimeter of access was the city

of Habara and that he was exposed principally to bureaucrats who are identified

with the regime. We caution headquarters on this rather obvious point, per-

haps because ve were exposed recently to AMKNOCK-1 who has been living deep

"In the entrails of the monster" in Oriente and who had a different view of

the temper of the people in that area from that given by LITAMIly for

Havana®

3.

In attachment C are the answers to a series of questions of operational

interest which were posed after a thorough review of the LITA'JI-g operational

file.

In some cases fuller biographic information can be dotained from L-9

If and when required.

I-g was most cooperative and understood clearly what

the debriefer was looking for.

In most cases, however, it is not probable

that I-9 will be of great help in making operational approaches and pitches

because of his present position.

Attachment B

Iritelligence

I.

Subject had nothing meaningful to add on disaffections or

realignments

as

a result of the October crisis.

With regard to internal friction within the GOC, he said that

there is considerable criticisn of the

"old" Communists by the

"new" Commists

and 26th of July.

He cited the case of Felipe @GUERRA Matos' criticis of

Joaquin ORDOQUI and Nicolas GUILLEN (previously reported) as cases in point.

By and large, the new Communists and Fidelistas are srabbing off most key

position in the covernment bureaucracy.

Fidel Castro Is still the principal

leader of the Revolution and both the PSP and the Soviets know that he is

vitally important to them.

Source was told by his sister-in-law (Conchita)

told Rene VALLES so teal than son of a bitch ade put to stop bothering

told Rene VAleNC to tell that

•pachita also says that Fidel is somewhat annoyed at his old crony Carlo:

lafael RODRIGUEZ because the zafra 13 proving to be such a bust and that

Fidel has 'complained that Carlos Rafael frequently doctors INA statistics to

his own advantage.

Despite these minor problems with key. Communist leaders,

Fidel continues on friendly terms with the key members of tie PSP, and 3las

Roce should be Included with Tidel, Raul and the Guevara among the four post

Source cormented that we must understand the myth created

by the Revolution and its propaganda in evaluating internal friction and

Nor-communist officials have been either brainwashed by propaganda,

are still blindly loyal to Pidel, or else have no place to so.

Thuse in the

final analysis,.

the cleavages are superficial and of no great moment.

Source had no detai. on the formation of tre fartido Unico.

mented that the PSP view PURS as an attempt by Fidel Castro to absorb it and

that the PSP consequentiy has seen cool to the Idea.

"4.

Subject was questioned on mass orgenizations in Cuba, but could

provide no information worth reporting.

5. Source was questioned on the positions of Lazaro Pena, Lucardo,

Ramiro VALDES

and Juan. NARINELLO.

He had little of Importance thaught he

conmented that Fidel, according to Conchita, did rot hold Lazaro fRENA in

high regard.

Source had no Information on MARINELLO's reported problems at

the University of Habana.

We covered the gamt on counter-revolutionary activitles and other

types of resistance with disappointingly negative results.

8. Source ras questioned about Chicón military activities. He

answered that he say ho Chinese, heard no comments äbout the Chinese

and did not set the Impression that the Chicoms are significantly active in

any fleld in Caba..

When assed about Cuban Confidence in the Soviets, he said that most

people he had tied to felt that the Soviets would cout to Cuba's defense ta

case of an American invasion if it happened to suit Soviet interests at the

time." He said that to his knowledge Soviet technicians were getting along

well with cubans, but he feels that the Cuban people view the Soviet with

detachment socially: and have very little to do with them.

Source was queried on any comments he had heard concerning a

GOC desire for a rapproachement with the United States.

he had heard nothing specific, but that he personally felt this was a

prospect frequen ly considered by Castro.

11. In view of Sources excellent sub-source in INFA (Conchita), it had

• been hoped that be nould be able to provide some valuable information on

this organization.

Actually, he had little to add to Conchita's comments in

regard to Fidel's attitude toward Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

We asked for

Conchita's evaluation of Carlos Rafael, and received information which has

many times been forwarded to headquarters and need not be repeated here.

Conchita made no seaningful comments on the effectiveness of Soviet and

Satellite technicians assigned to INRA.

(See also paragraph 5 of attachment

concerning Fidel Castro which may be of PI interest.)

12.

When esied about the principal reasons for industrial difficulties,

Source

said that he heard universal complaints about the need for spare parts.

He could only pinpoint the transport incustry. He had no specific information

on how some U.s. manufactured spare parts were being received, but commented

that Canada might be the source. He could give no specifies and said that

all correspondence on these matters is closely. held and encoded when cabled.

He has had no access to such inforration.

Regarding the rationing systen, he said that it 1s working more

smoothly now than a year ago and that grumbling is less now than in the

past. He said that things are better organized now and that he saw no desper.

ation because of food or other shortages.

• 14, Source said that he had heard of no significant increase in diseases,

though there was rich coment about cases of gestroenteritis.

Source hai no information whatever on the expori of the Cuban

Revolution are i no rators of whatever arles com oter the un Cuba.

16. Regarding diploratic relations with other Latin American countries

and Spain, his understanding is that the GOC wants no more breaks and is

especially interested in maintating the tie tith Madrid since Spain 1s the

nother country and an airline link to Europe.

17.

With regard. to the Civil. and. Foreign Services, Source said that

there 13

more stability and discipline in both than there was a year. ago,

with a consequent rise in morale.. He said that there is mich less free-

wheeling on the part of subordinates, but now the chiefs are expected to face

up to

their responsibilities and the competent must carry the load for the

majority who are incompetents.

We commented that this was not a phenomenon

absent in other public services and tried to flush Source out on the quality,

loyalty, and efficiency of the services.

He said that loyalty 1s increasing,

quality is circumscribed seriously by insufficient academic preparation and

Job training and efficiency has increased in the past year because of better

discipline and improved administrative practices.

Subject had nothing of consequence to add regarding the organization

of the Ministry of Foreign Relation and the Foreign Service.

This subject

will be covered to some extent in the operational attachment to this dispatch.

See paragraph 7 of attachment B concerning the rumor that Armando #FART will

replace Raul ROA at MINREX.

Source had little information on

the Church. He said that the

Catholic Church is not being molested and that relations between it and

the Goe have improved.. Pope John sulll was viewed with favor by the coc.

Batistianos in Miami frequently take che opposite view.)

Source had nothing of value on the Ministry of Education, the

University of Habana, the literacy program, the establishment of new technical

and scientific institutes, the quality of education at secondary and primary

21. Regarding the United States, he feels that there is still a furd

of friendship among the Cuban people and admiration of american technology.

He said that a few of his friends listen to U,S, broadmasts, but he had

nothing to say concerning their comments and the extent to which these broad-

casts are having an effect.

Regarding the temper of the Cuban people, source does not belleve

that the ingredients for a revolt exist.

Re feels that the regime may have

it had a year ago, or, if such is not the case, that

people are just more resigned to it.
