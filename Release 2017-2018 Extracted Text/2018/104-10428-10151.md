When OSlAnD was in Mexico City In late Sept and early Oct to get a

Soy visa and a lub transit visa, did he want to travel to Cuba right

away, alone, or have his wife join him there and then leava for Cuba,

or did he plen to return to the States first and then leave Inter.

Although it appears that he was then thinking only about a peaceful

change of residence to the sov union, it le also possible that he was

getting documented to make' a quick escape after assassinating President.

the following

day to Mexi City by road. On 27 Sept he went to Cuban Consulate General

to request visa to transit Cuba because he was golng to tom go to Moscow

via Habana. Consul Fusebio AZCuE told OSWALD that he would have to

consult his government, that the paper work required 10 to 12 days.

OSWALD, because of his irritable charaoter, became annoyed with AZCUs

and left the office slamming the door.

On 28 Sept OSWALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union to request a visa for Russia. He said

in helping his case, that his wife was'a sov citizen, that he was a

militant Comminist and had lived three yra 1n Russia.. OSWALD told the

Sov Consul that he could verily this quiokly by calling his wife who was

at that time in New Orleans in a hotel. The Sov Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case like this

would take from three to four months. OSWALD again became annoyed as he

had the day before in the Cuban Embassy and left the office very mad.

OSWALD returned to Texas on 3 lot via the border of Nuevo Laredo, Tamps.

no this could not be true because one was a Jew,

that it is definitely

a group of Fascists, very American, he 18 owner of & Cabaret of nudiats

and belongs to political gangsters. Ceoilia says It is absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD was). Julleta says

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with the

police and newspapermen. It wis perfeitly planned, indeed some'of the

police probably are of the same organization because Ruby mattre

Ceollia egrees, the pioture in evidence öf thet because the police

did not move to try to get in or anything for within a question of

seconds there should have been resotion. Julieta hopes they will

continue the Investigations at least Kennedy's brother has sent a special

agent.

Ceoilla says everything about lt is strange r the paper stated

they found this oharaoter (Ruby) drinking Coce Cole on the second floor

and they just left him there. Juliete adds that from the & very first

everything was absurd, that he was & Communist. Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned and that is evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

Julieta believes that this is 1l done by extreme rightists planned

Trom

very high up and that is why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't talk.

Juliete adds that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it is evident 1t 1s ail a

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men. She adds that in a very

obvious way this Indlyidual (OSWALD) pretended he was a Communist to

prepare the groundwork. Cecilfa belleves that he even purposely married

the Russian girl!: Julieta coments that all was very well prepared,

step by step to blame the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD'S

death everything is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the.

Investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death of

OSWALD the case was closed, but the FBI answered immediately that 1t was

not closed, that on the contrary, they had to open an investigation and

aldo the Senate v1l] name a commission to investigate, and Julieta hopes

they won't be alarmed at whatever may be turned up.

She adds that each

time more details i confirm that OSWALD was & Fascist and this business of

trying to join an anti-Castro organization and later poke his nose luto !

the Fair Play for Cube surely all of this was made up by the dallas police.

Likewise she Indicates that all the speeches given try to imply that he

(OSWALD) was a Penetics also NIXON spoke to the peoples of the Mation to

now everyone is frightened since they have seen just to what extent these

and, if things come out, that she hopes the publlo will be shaken up

so that they will stop this tendency toward Fascism. Julieta continues

that et the beginning she thought it was caused by racial trouble but

now she thinks it Is something more than thats' it is'a national thing

well planned and that OSWALD as not just aoting spontaneously. Cecllle

agrees, indeed it was a perfect shot with exact calculation and could not

have been done spontaneously. Julieta|says that his (OSWALD's) death

was evidently to shut him up and they had better not say now that Ruby

was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSHALD) because, Ruby is the

type who could never be pictured asa great patriot since he has a

crimiral record. Cecilia believes that Johnson (Pres.) and all those

people are paying attention to the strengith in this. Juliete is sure

of this and adds that the news (press) was redioulous in respect to

OSWALD In that he went to marry & Russian, Inter' was photographed with the

DaIly Workers with the Communist newspaper in one hand and a Iroskyist

ohe in the other hand; thus everything was very well prepared to blane

the loftiste, Indeed thie has alvays been the way they have done it,

commit the terrorist aots and then try to make it appear that the acts

were done by the Communists, that has always been the taotic and only

the people that have no idea about politics can swallow those things.

She adds that this is very dangerous, indeed when they are able to assassinate

a president like kennedy, Imagine how strong they are in the United Stetes.

DIR 84938 - Sinoe U. S. Immigration records next to nothing on travel

of U.S. oltizens, pls ask Mexi Immigration to check all their records

diotory statements made by Echeverria ire explained by desire of COM to play down importance

Of OSWALD visit here. Mexi line still is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverrle stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only Interested in finding |

out whether Maxi authorities tried to pay a story fron silvia.

This is obviously Incrorrect

Interpretation. Neither LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story.

Pls note

that according Echeverrie Silvia is being taken to Attorney Ceneral's office to which

Mexi press has easy access. Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted.

4) We

have as yet found no trace of the red headed Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him.

5) In addition to questions raised in yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently consider fessibility of requesting Mexi authorities to arrest

for Interrogations Fisable AZCUE, IUlER CATTERON and Alfredo MIRABAL. The two men are

Cuban nationals and Cuban consular officers. Luisa CALDERON is a dr secretary in Cuban

consulate here. In this connection artiole II of Consular Convention between U. S. and Mexi

exempts frow urrest "Consular officers, national of the state by which they are appointed,

and not engaged in any private occupation for gain' except "when charged with the commission

of an act designated by local legislation as crime other than misdemeanor and subjecting

the Individual guilty thereof to punishment by imprischment." We are checking to see whether

all of these indiyiduals are on current consuler list. Even assuming they are, and assuming

also thet Cuban-Mexican consuler convention de similar to ours, they would all seem to be

subject to arrest

eliminate any possibility that Maxi Goy could use them as witnesses. We know that AZCUE

went to Habana on 18 Nov and we are not now certain that he or others are in Mexi at

present time. 6)

whole problem. We hope this will be of some assistance In reducing his pressures on you.

DIR 85653 OnavY says their follow-up investigation Bf OSWALD's aotivities has produced

"rellable Indications" that he was In New Orleans on 19 Sept 63. This, coupled with

earlier evidence thet he ves In New Orleans applying for unemployment lisurance on 17 Sept

means OSWALD would have had to fly to Next and beok between 17 and 19 Sept in order to be

at Cub Emb getting hle pay off, as ALVARADO claim on 18 Sept, With this added info,

believe Mext can confidently regard ALVARADO as fabripator and tailor interrogation

necordingly. Perhapa he might respond to suggestion that he has been having delusions

and needs psychiatrio treatment.

DIR 85654 We have Just heard by phone from Kingman, who is at homs, that Mexi evaluation

inau they believe theere is other evidence Unai OSWAlD nade e bank deposit of 5,000 dollars

Ir the U.S. after he got baok from Mext on 3 Oot. This would tend, if true,

to corroborate

ALVARADO's story that he saw OSWALD get 5,000 for the Job and 1,500 for expenses. Kingman

thinks he heard that CURIIS got the info about the bank deposit fron an ODENVY man named

Clark We know of no such bank deposit. ODENVY here has just affirmed they never heard

this story. The story of the depoilt of 5,000 dollars is therefore almost certainly

erroneous Pis check It with odenvy there. We have advised ODENVY that this rumor exists

In Mexico. We can readily see how this piece of misinformation would mislead you. Ple

do not assume this His is 1n possession of all facts known to ODENVY or the Dallas police

fabrications on the OSWALD case from several continents sone originating with people on the

but out of sickly fancy and a desire to get into the intel game! / We do not think it a

remarkable colnoidence that both DORTICOS and ALVARADO talk about money paid to OSwALD.

For one thing, pey for an assassin is e factor which immediately rises in the mind of

expert and layman alike. Secondly, DORIICOS may have heard through some Russian or Cuban

source in the Mexi government that DURAN was asked whether the Cubans paid OSWALD for the

alleged assignment. " While we do not insist that ALVARADO's story is beyond all belief

we do urge that Mexi place it and ALVARADO under the most searching scrutiny. His interro-

gators must probe deeply into his make-up and lead him back through the though processes

which may have led him to make this possible mis-step. In securing confessions of

i fabrication, a sympathetie attitude, stressing awareness of the severe mental strain

have been observed Indicate by postmark that ROJAS was In Cozumel, bute at a later period

than he has stated and apparently for at least three to possibly five months, which contra-

diots information received from Daniel SOLIS, who stated Ylario ROSAS Villanueva was in Cozumel

for about ? weeks in June 63.

ROJAS readily admits that he, ROJAS, is the uncle of SOLIS's

wife. / A verification of his reported travel to the U.S. border, ramely, Nuevo Laredo, has

been established, although not on the specific dates furnished by ROJAS.

CMA records reflect

one Hilario ROJAS was on flt from Guadalajara to Nuevo Laredo on 3 Aug 62. CMA records

further reflect that a telegram dated o1 July: 62 at Nuevo Laredo authorized the CMA ticket

office at Guadalajara to issue a ticket to Hilario ROJAS of 665 Chilarde Street, Gundalajara.

(It is noted that ROJAS has stated that he formerly resided at Chilarde Street in Guadalajara.)

/ROJAS appears to be in normal physical condition and no outward signs observed of any nc..:1

deficiency.

He did not reveal any mental quirks. He tends to be voluble in his conversa-

tions and to wander from speöific lines of questioning. / He appears to react mentally in a

manner reflecting innate intelligence superior to that of his stated sixth grade education.

He does not volunteer any motive for furnishing info to the U. S. Gov concerning his alleged

association with unidentifled Cubans and with OSWALD,

both at U.s. border and at Cozumel. /

Other than discrepanoies nuttig noted in varlous Interviews conducted with ROJAS, the only

apparently unusual development concerns a reportedly second letter that he has directed to

U. S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, wherein he, according to his own statement, stated

that he had additional Info to furnish.. According to ROJAS, this additional info concerned

a so-called camera which he saw in Cozumel In the possession of the unidentified Bubans and

OSWALD, which camera reportedly had adaptations which could be utilized to fire about five

cartridges, which cartridges reportedly have a small gas compartment and that said gas was

for the purpose of cutting down on the noise made in firing said camera.

He also described

a rifle supposedly in the possession of these previously mentioned individuals. He claims to

have beenxial told by the Cubans that the

"camera" was worth about $50,000 and was a Russian

Invention. / attitude toward Polygraph Examination: It wes explained to ROJAS that It might

-be necessary-In the future to afford him a scientific examination with the use of certain.

Instruments. He said helwould be lagreeable to such an examination. / Attitude of Mexican

Government re Polygraph Examination:

It Is assumed that, as in the past case of the Nic,

Echeverria should be an consulted and his authorization obtained to conduct said examination.

At the same time, he canlalso be told that general results of exam would be furnished him.

his activities on behalf of the Fair Play For Cuba Committee In New Orleans, In: prior to

the assassination. (See para 264 above) In this connection it will be recalled that MORA

Stated after the death of the President that she hoped that the FBI would not look too hard

in New Orleane because it could be very bad"for us". / Source also reported that Reva BERNSTEIN,

former Chairman of the: FPFCC in Detroit, Mich., has been in Mexi for more than & month, that

she had been In Puerto Vallerte for a month, that she had wanted to go to Playa Azul but

that she did not do so because "it was not good to do so - so soon after the assassination"

that she was leaving Mexi to go to Zijuatenejo.

Source does not believe she was in Puerto

Vallarta, nor that she is presently In Zijuatenejo. / BERSIEIN also told source that she had

been questioned In Detroit, prior to her departure for Mexi, by the RCMP, but that no inquiry

had been made of her by the FBI or any U.S. police or Investigative agency. The interroga-

tion had to do with the FPFCC, Its aotivities In the Detroit area, and the fact that she had

reportedly acted as a mall drop for Canadian communists.

This interrogation took place in

Individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchase a ticket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest.

No ticket number was recorded for that person, and

a search of the company's records In Monterrey had falled to locate a ticket stub which

Sebastian PEREZ Hernandez,

desk clerk and assistant to the owner of the Hotel del Comercio,

had not conversed with OSWALD but remembered him clearly because few Americens stay at the

hotel.

She said OSWALD left the hotel each morning and did not return until evening, possibly

after PEREZ Hernandez had completed his working day and left the hotel. OSWALD was alone

and usually wore & knit, short-sleeved sport shirt and no coat or jaoket. He did not remember

seeing OSWALD depert the hotel on the moming of 2 Oct, but t it was possible that the

night watchman, who remains at the reception desk during the night might have been aware of

OSWALD's departure from the hotel. Watchman is Pedro RODRIGUEZ who dould be located at| the

saying did not believe OSWALD Involved and briefly explained his position by foll. "I met

OSWALD here. He stored into my office and wanted me to Introduce and recommend him to the Cubars.

He told me that he had lived in the USSR.. I told him that I would have to check before I could

recommend him. He wes nervous and his hands trembled, and he stormed out of my office!

at 1000, seen with Moskvichev at 1124, seen with GARMACHEV at 1402. Feel quite possible that

OSWALD spoke with YATSKOV basis 1 Oct 63 LIENVOY: When OSWALD spoke with OBYEDKOV, OSWALD

said had talked with a consul on Saturday, did not name KOSTIKOV. It was OBYEDKOV wholasked

suggestively if it was K and OSWALD said yes, possibly without thought.

Direct HQS attention

this transcript. Note however, KOSTIKOV has dark hair, YAISKOV light brown and very grey at

temples, giving appearance of almost white hair.

Could also well be that OSWALD first spoke

with KOSTIKOV who turned OSWALD over to his boss YATSKOV. Also, given the apparent frankness

of Y's discussions with LIOVAL-1, particularly his views Stalin and Khrushchey, would appear

possible he told I-1 truth re OSWALD, at minimum re meeting OSWALD.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD from Flannery (C/CA) ›Elena GARRO told Bunice Odio (who relayed to

TICHBORN on 9 Oot) that she and her duaghter were invited to a party at the Cuban Emb during

the period she now finds out that OSWALD was here in Mexi prior to the assassination. She

was invited by a Mexi secretary in the Cub Emb whose husband is a cousin of the GARRO

family (Horacio DURANI???). At the party, she saw three Gringos, not drihking, not mixing,

and more or less just standing around together l1ke "three bumps lon a 1og"!

They were so

obviously out of place, she asked someone In the Cub Imb about them and was told that "they

were just passing ain through". I She claime that on account of the way these three gringos

stood out she took a good long look at them as did ber daughter. When assassination occurred

and OSWALD's picture was spread into the newspapers, both Elena and her daughter immediately

said that he was one of the three gringos "without & doubt"

Note covering above memo to COS:

Do you want me to send the gist of this to Has? COS wrote!

Yes, but we should follow up first. Flannery then wrote! Nothing further.

DIR 56876 (Refs MEXI 1191 - para 397 above) Igs has no evidence that Sove have advance copy

of photo.

Comm sources assure us its copy of photo furnished by the FBI has also been

altered to black out the background.

At present the annex is scheduled for release around

mid Nov. / Considered opinion here is that Sov action per ref would seem to be a logical CI

step as-a precautionary measure on basis of published comn report. That a thorough

security surver should be done at this time either on Sov Emb's own Initiative or on request

from Moscow is not at all surprising. Independently of any specifice contained in Coum repor..

MEMO TO FBI from WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll Info he

allegedly received from & well known Cuban soientist and acquaintance on 23 Nov 63, but which

he had forgotten to report. The release of the Warren Comn Report reminded him of the Inci-

dent. / The solentist said he had been at the Havaha alrport on afternoon of 22 Nov 63 when

at 1700 hrs an afrcraft with Moti markings landed and parked at far side of the field.

Iwo men, whom he recognized as Cuban g "gangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance of

administration bldg and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures. Eis

curlosity was aroused, and he was able to leatn that the aircraft had Just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, Via TIjuana and Mexi City. The plane had been forbed to land at| TIjuana due

to engine trouble.

By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved In assassination. !

He speculated that OSWALD had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

In Dallas to organize or oversee the operation.

He told the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he had seen and heard and had to telll someone about it.

He then cautioned

source not to tell anyone else about it or they would hum both be shot by the Cubans. /

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION, /10 Dec 65) between Elena GARRO de Paz and Charles Thomas, Political

Officer tea pee Flena leased her alleged encounter with OSWALD.

Also,, present were

Thomas wife, and Elena's daughter, Elenita. Further info was given subsequently on 9, Jan 66.

During this latter conversation, Elena admitted she had gone to Amenb on an earlier occasion

with her daughter and mother-in-law and talked to two Emb officers (presumably from LEGAT) about

this matter®

She said since the Emb officers did not give much credence to anything they said,

they did not bother to give a very complete story. The following info supplemente and in

some instances corrects that given in the memo of Das 10. / 1.!

Ivilla, Horacio, and Ruben

DURAN are all cousins of Flene. Splvia 1s married to Horaclo, a weak man, who was converted

to Communism by Ricardo GUERRA. Eiena has nothing to do with Silvia whom she detests and

considers a whore.

Ruben was born in U.s. and served In U.S, army during war.

...Party was

held at home of Ruben.: / Elena believesidate of party was 2 or 3 Sept 63. few days befor

vialt of Sor astronaut, Gagers, out is, not sure of date.../ At the party OswAnD wore a black

sweater. He tended to be silent and stared at the floor.

Two young American companions,

one was very tall and siender and had long blond hair utt which hung across forehead, gaunt

face and long protruding chin; other was tall, short light brown hair...All three were

obviously Americans and did not miz or dance with other people,

The three were friends,

because Elena saw them by chance the next day walking down the street together. A Although

Elena had returned from Europe in June or July, she had already met Eusebio AZCUE and knows

were in heated laiscussion on that

occasion about Kennedy and they came to conclusion that the only

solution was to kill him.

Elena said CARBALIIDO is known as & Castro agent, he had been to Red China, Sov Union, and

In N.Y, and who is now a f professor at Rutgers. The day after assassination, Elenita

encountered Sra, de ACUR do Janbois. On wedne hex, ard, del Azul hurried out of store.

AZCUE was called back to Habana after assassination and his wife followed shortly...

Elena described some developments which may have some bearing on her claim that she saw

at home of her cousin

Ruben DURAN when OSWALD was In Mexico prior to

OSWALD at a par, Elena said Carlos SOLORZANO 16 well acquainted with Cub Amb HERNANdEZ

told SOLORAANO he wanted to meet Elena, so SOLORZANO arranged a party at his own home on

30 June 66 and invited both of them.

Also present were Tito MONTEROSO and his wife;

Elvira VARGAS, leftist Journalist with NOVEDADES and personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin DIAZ Canedo, head of publishing firm

called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, painter; who was invited to make her feel at

ease, since he is a friend of hers and was the only anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening,

Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she described as intelligent and cultured, cucen-

trated his attention on her..... and expressed interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He issued a personal Invitation to her to attend the annual literary festival of the Casa

de las Americas in Havana: She said she was not & Fideliste and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present...../ Later, her friend,

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned ber not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On 4 July 66 & driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre in

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and

some printed matter from the Casa

The first letter, written last October. (66?) geve her address

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written In April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

The envelope for the first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

sender, which was the Cub Emb here.

The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg.

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments. / Elena stated the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was because she spent several

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel is

Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub for carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address. / Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensibly to

CALVILLO and two close friends of his, Ernesto de la Pers and Margarita MICHELENA.

Iwo

other friends of these three who might have learned of 1t are Eunice ODIO and June COBB.

She has always been suspiolous.of all three because they went out of their way to

cultivate her when she returned from Europe In 63 and made such a point of being outspoken

professional ant1-Commuhiste.

Elemna said CALVILLO was a close personal friend lof Noe

PALOMARES and Pres: DIAZ, Ordez,

and that guards, presumably from Gobernacion, had been

placed outside her home when she returned from the Hotel Vernonth....../ Elena thought 1t

possible that the lub Emb had deliberately given her the letters from the Casa de las

Americas with the Vermont Street address in order to frighten her.

She was already con-

cerned about what appeared to be three gunshots that had been fired through her upstairs

window while she was out of the house three weeks ago.

This report constitutes the first piece of substantive| info

about OSWALD's sojourn 1a Mexl to appear since the assassination of Pres K. We understand

Although the Warren Comm obtaihed

no facts pointing to homosexuality on OSWAlD's part, this allegation has been made by elements

of the press covering GARRISON's investigation In New Orleans.

It is therefore necessary to

bear this possibility in mind when interviewing the source and others who spent time with

OSWALD in Mexi. It is our hope that the facts obtained through these interviews will help to

confitm that several of GARRISON'a allegations about involvement of anti-Castro Cubans, WOFACT,

given or six people. ....
