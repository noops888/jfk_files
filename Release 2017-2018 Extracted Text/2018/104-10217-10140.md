SUBJECT 3 Status of AMCALL-1 Ransom Negotiation

1. On 26 August 1970, $120,000 ransom was
paid for the release of AMCALL~1. $70,000 of this
amount wds paid by the Agency and AMCALL-1's wife
arranged to obtain the remaining $50,000 from
August Vanistendael, a prominent Belgian with high
level Vatican connections interested in AMCALL-1
who presumably provided the additional money. Al-
though there was no firm commitment as to the exact
time AMCALL-1's release would be effected, AMECRU-1
anticipated his release within 60-90 days after
Payment of the ransom.

2, Although 6 months have now elapsed since
AMECRU~1 delivered the money to the Cuban negotiator
in Paris, there was no way to determine the reason
for the delay in AMCALL-1’s release until AMECRU-1
was able to return to Paris to discuss the matter
with the GOC representative authorized to negotiate
the ransom cases. Since AMECRU-1 now resides in
Miami he is no longer able to maintain as close
contact with the Paris official as was the case when
he lived in Barcelona. However, he did arrange a
trip to Paris in January to discuss the status of

1 and other ransom candidates with the GOC

Manuel Pineiro, the DGI

Director in Cuba, stating that AHCALL-1 had no desire

or intention of engaging in political activities

after his release and wished to seek employment with
some European social research organization. A letter
from August Vanistendael verifying AMCALL-l's intentions,
with assurance from Vanistendael that he would assist

in resettling AMCALL-1 in Europe, was attached to
AMECRU-1 letter to Pineiro, The|

obtained copies of the AMECR
from QUPILL-1 and forwarded

U-1 letters to Pineiro
them to Headquarters.



3. AMECRU-1 also told AMCALL-1's wife that

the GOC Paris representatives offered to return

the ransom money if the interested parties were

not satisfied with the current progress of the

case. The ramifications involving any demand for
return of AMCALL-1's ransom and termination of any
further efforts to obtain his release are considerably
greater than was the case with AMPANIC-7 whose entire
ransom was provided by the Agency. In the case of
AMCALL-1, there would be no way to demand return of
our share of the ransom without exposing Agency
interest until such time as the Catholic contributors
indicate a desire to recover their $50,000 investment.
Not only did Vanistendael's letter fail to indicate
any concern in this respect, but clearly emphasized -
his continuing deep interest in obtaining AMCALL-I's
freedom. AMCALL-1's wife is also insistent that his
chance of being released not be endangered during
this precarious stage of the negotiation and that

any decision concerning return of the ransom be
determined by AMECRU-1's evaluation of GOC intent.
Although AMCALL-1's wife has always been discreet

and her relationship with the Agency cooperative and
above reproach, her understandable anxiety over her
husband could lead to extreme resentment should any
attempt be made to recover the Agency's share of

the ransom at this juncture. This would be particularly

true if the Catholic contributors show no alarm over
their investment or the present lack of Progress made
in effecting AMCALL-1's release.

4. It is, therefore, suggested that the cH
Agency has little choice but to await ANECED-1's
return to Miami where a detailed assessment of
AMCALL~1's status can be obtained by SESIGH-2,
our contact with AMECRU-1,
