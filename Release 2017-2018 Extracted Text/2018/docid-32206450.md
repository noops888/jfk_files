Positions in Grades GS-14 and Higher

Budget Estimates for Fiscal Year 1966

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Bureau of Budget Circular No. A-11, Revised, Transmittal Memorandum

No. 25, dated August 25, 1964, required the submission of supplemental intorma-

tion concerning positions in grades GS-14 and above, either with the regular

budget submission or subsequently and prior to budget hearings.

Before going into the requested information it is desired to again call

to the attention of the Bureau of Budget certain facts concerning the promotional

program of the FBI, because they have a direct bearing and effect upon changes

in the number of filled positions in all grades. Positions in the FBI are excepted

from the classified civil service. We recruit our own personnel. Vacancies in all.

grades except 2, 3, 4 and 10, the entrance grades for new employees, are filled

by internal promotions.

This Bureau has had a definite promotional program since June of 1943.

Approval has been given by both the Bureau of Budget and Congress to funds for such

promotions. All employees are made aware of the Bureau's promotional program

and therefore, in order to sustain a career service, we must be in a position to

properly remunerate those given higher responsibilities.

Grade promotions are

not automatic at any grade level, as each must be earned by the work actually

performed, and the Bureau has very carefully devised criteria for these promo-

tions.

The Bureau's policies and procedures on promotions are under close

executive supervision and scrutiny through a highly centralized personnel manage-

ment system. The Bureau adheres closely to Civil Service Commission position

classification standards in classifying positions, and we insure that employees

perform at their grade level. It is not felt by this Bureau that the Federal Salary

Reform Act of 1962 or the Government Employees Salary Reform Act of 1964 have

any effect on this program since they primarily adjusted salaries and not grade

structure.

This Bureau is opposed to any proposals being made applicable to it

that would place a tighter control on the number of positions in grades, or increase

the time required in grade intervals before promotion. Full and complete explana-

tion of this Bureau's reasons were set forth in material furnished in reply to

letter dated April 11, 1964, from Bureau of Budget to Attorney General Robert

F. Kennedy on this subject.

The summary table requested by Bureau of Budget for positions in

grades GS-14 and above is attached.

## Page 5

In response to the current request of the Bureau of Budget for a special

justification by grades, for GS-14 and above where the number proposed for fiscal

year 1966 exceeds the number actually filled during fiscal year 1964, the following

information is submitted:

1. Positions proposed for fiscal year 1966 as compared with number

actually filled in fiscal year 1964 are tabulated below:

2. The increase of one in Executive positions is to implement the

provisions of the Federal Executive Salary Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-426)

which allows four such positions. Specifically, it provides for two positions

entitled "Assistant to the Director, " there previously having been provision for

) only one. The duties and responsibilities of these two positions are equal and

organizationally necessary in order to properly discharge the Bureau's increasing

responsibilities.

3. The Director of the FBI has specific statutory authority (Section

505(e) of Title V of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended) to place a total of

75 positions in grades GS-16, 17 and 18. These positions are occupied by top

supervisory officials of the FBI. On an overall basis there is no change in the

17 on 18.

total number of these positions. The increase of one in GS-17 is offset by the

4. The increases of eight positions for GS-15 and of 27 positions for GS-

14 are due to increased responsibilities of the FBI requiring such additional

positions and to the specific promotional policy referred to at the beginning of this

material.

For example, our need for additional Special Agent personnel, in itself,

creates the necessity for additional incumbents among supervisory personnel.

Further, our recent establishment of an additional field office in Jackson,

Mississippi, increased our supervisory staff by four.

SUMMARY STATEMENT

FUND AND PERSONNEL NEEDS--FISCAL YEARS 1965 AND 1966

Subsequent to the justification of the 1965 fund needs

of the Bureau before the House Appropriations Subcommittee and

subsequent to the submission of the preliminary estimate for the

fiscal year 1966, two laws have been enacted making it necessary

for this Bureau to request additional funds and personnel for the

fiscal year 1965 and to increase our request for funds and person-

nel for the fiscal year 1966. The first is the C1v1l Rights Act

of 1964 (Public Law 88-352, approved July 2, 1964). The second 1s

the Government Employees Salary Reform Act of 1964 (Public Law

88-426, approved August 14, 1964) •

In addition, two new programs are being undertaken by

the FBI beginning in latter part of October, 1964: the extension.

of name check procedures and security background investigations of

White House personnel being undertaken at the request of the

President.

In order to simplify consideration of the fund and per-

sonnel needs of this Bureau, the budget schedules submitted here-

with include the additional funds needed for both fiscal years

1965 and 1966 for the foregoing new legislation and programs.

There are set forth below

(1) a justification of the

additional funds and personnel needed for the fiscal year 1965;

(2) a summary tabulation of fund and personnel needs for both

fiscal years 1965 and 1966; and (3) the justification material

for the fiscal year 1966.

a number of years and there is no indication but that this

trend will continue.

In addition, the Bureau continues to receive new

responsibilities. Among other Items, the C1v1l Rights Act of 1964,

approved July 2, 1964, has sharply Increased our work in the civil

rights fleld and since our staff is hard pressed to keep abreast

of the existing work, additional personnel 1s being requested

for both the fiscal years 1965 and 1966 to handle the new work

growing out of this legislation.

Further, because of an increasing volume of urgent special-

type work in the civil rights and criminal categories which has

required the extraordinary assignment of manpower, the Bureau has

had to divert agent personnel and other resources from other vital

work in the security field and in some criminal categories to handle

these urgent special assignments. To correct this situation, the

Bureau in 1ts original submission for 1966 requested an additional

330 full-year employees for security-type work recommended by the

President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and approved by

the President.

'or

C1v1] Rights Act of 1964

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, approved July 2, 1964,

substantially broadened our work in the civil rights field.

One section of the Act pertains to discrimination in

places of public accommodation, such as hotels and restaurants.

It authorizes the Attorney General to take various

steps in connection with discriminatory practices in such facil-

Ities. With a tremendous number of public accommodation-type

business establishments throughout the country, we expect to

be called upon to Investigate a substantial number of complaints.

Another section of the Act pertains to discriminatory

practices in public facilities throughout the country, such as

libraries and parks. Here again; the Attorney General 18

enabled to take action to further the orderly progress of deseg-

regation in such facilities. This will give rise to numerous

matters for investigation.

There is also a section of the Act pertaining to dis

criminatory practices in the field of public education and the

Attorney General is authorized to take certain actions. The

Bureau expects to be called upon to handle many complaints

arising under the purview of the public education section of the

Act.

Since the FBI has been in need of additional personnel

to keep abreast of 1ts old work, 1t 1s impossible for 1t to

absorb any of the new work under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Accordingly, an additional 330 employees will be needed for both

the fiscal years 1965 and 1966 to handle the added work accruing

from this new legislation. Insofar as the fiscal year 1965 1s

concerned, these employees will be on the rolls for less than a

full year and thus the supplemental request for 1965 1s being

submitted on the basis of achieving the equivalent of 236 full-

year employees (166 agents and 70 clerks).

Included is an amount of $962,298 to cover higher costs of

"other expense" items in the fiscal year 1965. The greatest

portion of this amount 1s for travel, transportation of things,

and communications services where substantial Increased costs

have been eaused by the necessity for having large numbers of

agents in a constant travel status, the movement of large groups

of agents from one office to another to meet heavy work loads

arising in different localities, and the need for round-the

clock contact with and supervision of important field investiga

tions, primarily in connection with civil rights work.

JUSTIFICATION

Two new programs are being undertaken by the FBI beginning

In the latter part of October, 1964. One involves an extension of

name check procedures in regard to the more than one million name

check requests received annually from other Government agencies.

The other

concerns

security background investigations of White House

personnel being undertaken at the request of the President.

Extension of Name Check Searches

Over the years, all Government agencies submitting name

check requests have been made cognizant that their

requests for a

search of the Bureau's investigative files are for information of

a security nature and that references of a strictly criminal nature

are not reviewed, with certain exceptions such as requests under

Executive Order 10450 (Security of Government Employees Program),

unless specifically requested by the submitting agency. The agencies

have also been made cognizant that name check requests are not

searched through our Identification Division. This 1s accomplished

by the submission of a fingerprint card or request directly to the

Identification Diviston.

7-13a

DocId: 32206450 Page 30

## Page 31

While the agencies submitting name check requests also

submit to the Identification Division an estimated 90% of their

more than one million annual name check request submissions, under

our expanded procedures beginning in the latter part of October,

1964, all name check search submissions will also be checked against

the Identification Division records. To accomplish this, the Gov-

ernment agencies are being advised that in the event fingerprints

or an identifying arrest number are not available and a name check

by the Identification Division is desired, a duplicate copy of the

Investigative files name check request should be submitted directly

to the Identification Division.

The expanded name search procedures also provide that all

name check requests from Government agencies will include a search

of security and criminal investigative file references even though

this has not been requested in some instances in the past.

It is estimated that It will require the services of 117

clerical employees to carry out these expanded name check search

procedures.. These additional employees will not be on the rolls

for the full fiscal year 1965. It is estimated all will be on the

rolls November 1, 1964, which will result in achleving the equiva.

lent of 77 full-year employees during the fiscal year 1965. The

cost in that year is estimated at $343,000.

The 117 employees will be on the rolls the entire fiscal

year 1966. Their cost in that year is estimated at $582,000.

Investigation of white House Personnel

The White House has indicated that current security back-

ground investigations in regara to approximately 1,700 White House

personnel will be required. Of this number, some 600 are military

personnel and the milltary services will be handling the back-

ground investigations in regard to these.

The remaining 1,100 will require background investiga-

tions by the FBI. It is estimated that about 825 will fall in

the full-field category. It is estimated that the remaining 215,

or about 25%, will have had a full-field investigation within the

recent past from the Civil Service Commission or the FBI and will

require an investigation covering a shorter period of time. Our

supplemental fund and personnel needs to handle this added work

are based on these premises.

In addition to the 1,100 Investigations to be received

Immediately, there will be a monthly flow of about 30 investiga-

tions beginning with December to take care of turnover. Since

these will be new

employees in most instances, all will require a

full-field investigation..

Accordingly, our estimated additional needs in the fis-

cal year 1965 are based on the handling of the following work loads:

825 full-fields of present staff

275 supplemental investigations of present staff

210 full-fields for turnover (30 a month for.

period December, 1964 through June, 1965)

To handle this work in the fiscal year 1965, we will

require an additional 102 full-year employees (62 agents and 40

clerks). Of these, 82 (52 agents and 30 clerks) will be for assign-

ment in the Field Service. These additional 102 full-year employees

and their support will require supplemental funds totaling $887,000

1n the fiscal year 1965.

In the fiscal year 1966, an estimated 360 full-field

Investigations will be received. This will require the utiliza-

tion of 30 full-year employees (18 agents and 12 clerks) to handle

this work at an estimated cost of $268,000.

The additional funds and personnel needed in the fiscal

years 1965 and 1966 to defray the costs resulting from the two

Background of Original Appropriation Requests

Our original requests for the fiscal years 1965 and 1966

were predicated upon rock-bottom essential operating requirements

and represented the minimum necessary to handle the work and re-

sponsibilities then imposed upon

us. No provision was made to

handle the worit that would eventually accrue under the Civil

Rights Act of 1964, since it had not been enacted at that time,

nor was any provision made for the added costs that would accrue

from the new pay raise legislation just approved. Ilkewise, the

extension of the name check program and investigation of White

House personnel were not Initiated until October, 1964.

For many years the Bureau has utilized all feasible

management tools to follow a program of strict austerity in our

fund and manpower requirements. Among other things, we keep pro-

duction records wherever our operations are susceptible to such

measurement. In addition, an inspection program has been a part

of our operations for many years. This program 1s designed to

examine and analyze critically all phases of the Bureau's opera-

tions -- both at the Seat of Government and in the field - with

the objective of appraising and improving, on a continuous basis,

their effectiveness, efficiency and economy. We also

have stream

lining committees which go into specific operations

with the same

over-all objective, and the

same beneficial results are brought

about through the

suggestions which our employees make.

EXPENDITURES ENTERING INTO THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROBLEM

The Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains what

are known as Legal Attaches in ten foreign countries. The cost

of these offices is contained in the activity entitled "1.

security and Criminal Investigations"

shown on page 7-3 of this

budget submission. For the fiscal year 1964 the actual expendi-

tures affecting the balance of payments were $723,000. For the

fiscal year 1965 the estimated expenditure cost is $748,000, and

for fiscal year 1966 a total of $752,000, or an increase of

$4,000. This net increase 1s entirely attributable to the

recent

pay raise legislation and to normal salary increases.

These operations abroad are considered to be essential

and cannot be discontinued or curtailed without seriously affect-

Ing the security of this Nation. This subject has been covered

in detail in the material submitted to the Bureau of the Budget

In compliance with Circular No. A-58.

SECURITY AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

I. - COORDINATION

The staff needed at our headquarters to coordinate and

supervise the wide range of investigations handled by our field

staff deployed throughout the country Is largely determined by the

volume of that investigative work.

In this regard, our investigative work has been very

heavy, particularly in the criminal category; civil rights inves-

tigations have mounted; and our vital responsibillties and work in

the

Internal security field have demanded the assignment of addi-

tional manpower. At the

same time, special-type investigations

such as those dealing with civil rights and other urgent criminal

matters have required the assignment of many special agents to a

single investigation.

Although the outlook 1s for further increases in our 1n

vestigative work throughout the field, we propose to handle the

concomitant increase in coordinating work with the same staff as

made available by the approved appropriation for the fiscal year

1965, except for the increased work relating to investigation of

White House personnel, which has been treated elsewhere in this

justification.

SECURITY AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

II. - MAINTENANCE OF INVESTIGATIVE RECORDS

AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM

1. - GENERAL STATEMENT: Through 1ts investigative and

auxillary functions the FBI comes into possession of a vast amount

of data, such as that contained in the reports recording the results

of investigations conducted in the many matters under the FBI's

jurisdiction. These records are maintained at our headquarters

and are so indexed that the information 1s quickly available. The

Files and Communications Division has the responsibility of main-

taining this vital centralized records system as well as the Bureau's

extensive communications network.

Through Presidential authority and other directives the

Bureau has the responsibility of coordinating and disseminating

security and intelligence data, particularly as 1t concerns espi-

onage; sabotage and related subversive matters affecting the

domestic Internal security. As a result, the Bureau's central

record file serves many Federal agencies through the extensive

name check service provided to them. During the fiscal year

1964 a total of 1,688, 068 name checks were received with well

over one million of these being submitted by other Federal agencies.

This aids them to bolster their defenses against persons with

criminal reputations, subversive backgrounds, and the like.

1. - GENERAL STATEMENT:

Over-All Picture

Our investigative work throughout the field, particular-

ly in the many and varied criminal classifications under our

jurisdiction, continues to increase. This Includes the involved

and urgent investigations regarding civil rights matters which

have reguired a mounting assignment of manpower.

At the same time, there has been no abatement whatso-

ever in our important internal security responsibilities and

operations. Among other things, the Sovlet Intelligence services

have over the years continued to increase their personnel and

expand their operations. The growing Soviet espionage drive

against this Nation Increases and complicates our counterintel-

ligence responsibilities.

Further, special-type investigations are occurring

with Increasing frequency and are placing extraordinary demands

upon our manpower and other resources. For example, matters

growing out of the sit-ins, bombings and related problems at

Birmingham, Alabama, have required the peak assignment of 231

special agents and by September 12, 1964, our costs had reached

an estimated $608,000. In the Investigation into the murder of

[leutenant Colonel Lemuel A. Penn, who was shot while driving

along a Georgia highway on July 11, 1964, as many as 83 special

agents were assigned at one time and by September 5, 1964, our

costs

were estimated at $89,500. The Investigation into the

assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent murder of

Lee Harvey Oswald placed tremendous demands upon our manpower

III. - FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

and

resources. As an aftermath, the Secret Service has begun

to call on us from time to time to loan special agent personnel

to augment its manpower when the President has appeared in some

localities. By September 1, 1964, we had loaned a total of 293

agents on 32 occasions.

Three civil rights workers were last seen in Mississippi

on June 21, 1964, and became the object of an intensive search

with more than 167 special agents being involved in this and

other urgent matters in Mississippi. The bodies of the murdered

c1vil rights workers were found on August 4, 1964. By August 14,

1964, our costs had reached an estimated $395,000.

Responsibilities

resulting from new legislation con-

tribute substantially to our Increasing work load volumes.

For example, numerous items of new legislation enacted in the

Fall of 1961 and shortly thereafter, the bulk of which was designed

to aid in the drive against organized crime, had as of August 1,

1964, resulted in the opening of 25,600 new cases.

Additional new responsibilities continue to be received.

This will further add to our work load volumes. Recent legisla-

tive enactments have included the following:

PubliC Law 0o-200, Approved December 13, 1963 - Amends

the Peace Corps Act to make it a violation to misuse the Peace

Corps name, seal or emblem.

Public Law 88-201, Approved December 13, 1963 - Makes

unlawful the introduction, sale or delivery in interstate com-

merce of any seat belt manufactured which does not meet standards

prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce.

under the Juvenile Delinquency Act.

Work Load Volumes

The growing demands upon our field staff, are reflected

in the high number of pending investigative

matters which totaled

124,930 on September 1, 1964. Six per cent were in a delinquent

status. The heavy backlog of work is also reflected in the

growing number of assignments being carried by our investigative

staff on an Individual basis. On September 1, 1964, there was

an average assignment of 23 matters. In contrast, on July 1, 1960,

the average assignment was 18 and on July 1, 1957, it was but 15.

This growing trend in the average volume of work assigned is not

only an indication of increased productivity; 1t also mirrors

the growing work and responsibilities

we have been called upon

to assume over the years.

During the fiscal year 1964, there were 666,982

Investigative matters received in the criminal, civil and security

classifications. This 1s a Jump of 30, 611 matters, or 5%, over

the high volume of work experienced during the prior year. The

volume of our investigative work will continue to mount, it being

estimated that 690,000 matters will be received for handling

during the fiscal year 1966. These figures are exclusive of

reimbursable applicant-type investigations to be referred from

various Federal agencies and departments.

III. - FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

Overtime Services

Many of our responsibilities give rise to matters which

by their very nature must receive immediate and continuous inves-

tigation. As a result, some overtime 1s inevitable. In handling

our growing work and responsibilities, however, our investiga-

tive staff has been performing over two times the minimum over-.

time necessary to qualify for the limited payments under fringe

benefits

regulations. This increases our productive capacity

enormously. For example, on an over-all basis, overtime per-

formed during the fiscal year 1964 totaled 3,330,265 hours. This

was equivalent to the services of 1,601 special agents on a full-

year basis. Had it been necessary to employ the additional 1,601

agents, the costs would have been in excess of $19 million.

After considering the extent to which this overtime was compen

sated under fringe benefits regulations, there was a savings to

the Government of nearly $13 million when compared with the value

of the total overtime performed.

The 1966 appropriation request provides for funds to

continue these payments for unscheduled and administratively

uncontrollable overtime duty.

we can expect to be called upon to

handle a mounting volume of work in

the internal security field of

problems,

the Bureau continually initiates new program

and procedures and redirects its investigative efforts

Along this line, since 1962 we have concentrated on

cases in the security and counterintelligence field

holding out the best promise of significant security

breakthroughs. While a lesser number of investigative

a tement in cha

matters may be handled, this does not reflect any

abatement in the amount of work involved. To the

contrary, this procedure has enabled us to make greate

and more significant strides In meeting our security

responsibilities.

C. - COMMUNIST PARTY-USA

Paramount allegiance to the Soviet Union has been a

fundamental tenet of the Communist Party-USA from 1ts very Inception

and throughout its existence it has never knowingly deviated from

the views of the Soviet Union. The Party looks upon our Government

as its enemy which it seeks to

overthrow, by forceful means if

necessary.

In an effort to hasten the day when 1t can achieve that

objective, the Communist Party-USA In 1964 has greatly stepped up

its programs designed to Increase Its membership through the

recruitment of youth; to place Party leaders on college campuses;

to increase the dissemination of its propaganda; and to create the

false impression that 1t is a legitimate political party by entering

candidates for public office.

It would be difficult to single out any period since the

passage of the Internal Security Act of 1950 in which the Party's

optimism surpasses that experienced during 1964. The most important:

reason for this 1s the December, 1963, decision of the Court of

Appeals reversing the conviction of the Party for failing to register

under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and the

refusal of the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Court of

Appeals.

In the bellef that the "cllmate" in the United States 1s

changing rapialy in its favor, the Communist Party-USA 1s beginning

to open the veil of secrecy that has surrounded it since June, 1961,

C. - COMMUNIST PARTY-USA - Continued

when the United States Supreme Court upheld the order of the

Subversive. Activities Control Board that the Party must register

under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950.

Among other things, the Party's National Committee met in July,

1964, for the first time since 1961; a new Party program is in

preparation; and Party leader Gus Hall has indicated that a

Communist Party-USA national convention will be held in the early

part of 1965.

Although Party members are being urged to speak out more

freely about their beliefs, the Party has given no indication that

it intends to abandon its use of security measures. In most parts

of the country, Party members continue to employ safeguards to

protect their identity and Party meetings are still held under

clandestine conditions.

Because of its stepped-up activities and the semi-

clandestine manner in which the Party operates, efforts to identify

its members and activities become increasingly more difficult. We

are dealing with a movement which is constantly fluid, constantly

varied and

elusive. Few things would give the

Communist Party-USA

more comfort than a widespread underestimation of the menace which

it presents

to the internal security of the Nation. The need for a

highly effective investigation of this subversive organization 1s a

very real need, to be ignored only at the risk of placing in serious

jeopardy the national defense of the Nation.

D. - SOVIET-BLOC INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

Intelligence Attack Continues to Mount: Unable to

compete with the scientific and industrial developments of free

nations, the Soviet Union 1s aware that only through effective

espionage can 1t gain the technological and military supremacy so

essential if it is to achieve Its objective of world conquest. A

review of statistics during the past decade reveals that each year

the Soviet intelligence services have enlarged their budgets,

increased their personnel and expanded their operations. It 1s

clear that their primary target in this massive effort is the

United States.

Use of Official Personnel and Establishments: Historically,

the Soviet intelligence services have appropriated the great bulk

of official positions abroad, primarily using their official

representations and diplomatic establishments in other countries

as bases from which to carry on their espionage operations. This

use of official personnel is the so-called "legal" espionage

approach.

Capitalizing on such official cover and the diplomatic

immunity from prosecution which it usually enjoys, the Soviet Union

has, when viewing the picture over an extended period, steadily built

up the number of its official personnel assigned to the United States.

Long seeking even greater representation in the United

States, more widely spread over our country, a cherished goal of the

Soviet

intelligence services was realized when the United States

Department of State signed an agreement with the Soviet Union on

June 1, 1964, providing for the reciprocal establishment of

consulates in the respective countries.

Soviet-Bloc "Illegal" Espionage: A growing problem 1s

the extent to which the Soviet intelligence services are dispatching

"Illegal" espionage agents into the United States. These Individuals

are professional Intelligence officers, are extensively trained,

usually bear

assumed identities, and are supplied with expertly

fabricated documents and unlimited funds.. They enter the United

States without difficulty to become assimilated into our population,

eventually

serving as the nucleus of an extensive clandestine

espionage network. Their detection among our 190 million population

1s a counterintelligence problem of great magnitude.

Along this Ilne, with the Increasing atmosphere of

friendship, peace

and goodfellowship toward the United States which

has been fostered by the communist countries, there 1s a corollary

increase in trade negotiations and delegations, cultural exchanges,

and the like, creating a constant flow of visitors between the

United States and these countries.. In the case of Hungary, for

example, only a handful of visitors arrived in the United States

from that country in any given month four or five years ago.

There has been a marked change in this in recent years, and over

1,000 visItors arrived here in July, 1964, from Hungary alone. Among

other Investigative problems, this creates a vehicle and a base for

the clandestine introduction into the United States of individuals

having intelligence assignments.

E. - OTHER INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE

During recent years the FBI has been required to steadily

accelerate its efforts to develop and disseminate to interested

United States agencies and officials current intelligence data

developed from sources within the United States concerning nonbloc

countries. These efforts have been in response to the expressed

needs of other agencies for up-to-date intelligence, particularly

relating to certain critical countries and areas. This, of course,

has placed growing demands upon our manpower.

F. - NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO EXPAND

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE COVERAGE

The growing espionage attack against this Nation by Soviet-

bloc and nonbloc countries gives rise to new matters and situations

which can only be handled by the assignment of more manpower.. At

the same time, additional personnel is needed so that we might

broaden our efforts to penetrate and counteract the intelligence

operations of the Soviet-bloc countries operating in the United

States:

We are also confronted with further demands upon our

available personnel in meeting the many urgent special-type matters

occurring with increasing frequency in the criminal and civil rights

fields which require immediate handling and involve the extraordinary

assignment of manpower. The press of these requirements in other

fields of operations, such as extensive civil rights investigations

and urgent criminal investigations, has been such that we have had

to divert agent personnel and resources from our vital counter-

intelligence mission. The requested additional personnel is needed

so that we may correct this situation and implement the approved

recommendation of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory

Board which is that steps be taken to assure that the FBI has

adequate resources for its internal security operations to effect

the required domestic counterintelligence coverage of both Soviet-

bloc and nonbloc official

installations and personnel who may be

engaged in Intelligence and related activities inimical to the

national security.

There have been many years of hearings, judicial reviews

and trials growing out of the Government's efforts to act under

the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950, all of which

have involved a vast amount of investigative effort by the FBT

On June 8, 1964, the Supreme Court denied the Governmenü &

petition to review an earlier Court of Appeals decision reversing

the conviction of the Communist Party-USA for failing to register

as an organization under the Internal Security Act of 1950. Under

other provisions of the Act, legal steps were also taken to have

individual members register. Certain of these Individual member-

ship cases are now before the Supreme Court for review.

The investigative work of the FBI is keyed to the

Government's prosecutive steps. Decisions upholding the Govern-

ment's prosecutive position would definitely expand our work.

The Security Index represents a list of the

names of those individuals who could be con-

sidered for apprehension and detention in the

event of an emergency in order to safeguard the

Internal security of the United States by pre-

venting sabotage and insurrection and breaking

the leadership of the Communist Party or other

revolutionary groups.

(b) - ALL CASES ON THE SECURITY INDEX SUBJECTS ARE UNDER

CONTINUAL REVIEW TO INSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS SHOULD

BE CONTINUED IN THE SECURITY INDEX.

1.

Index must always be kept in a current status

so it can be put to effective use on a moment's

notice in the event of an emergency.

2.

In maintaining 1t in a current status, contin-

uous investigative activity is necessary.

Such investigation encompasses movement and

activities of the individuals included therein,

contacts and associates, conspiratorial objec-

tives, procurement of legal evidence, and es-

tablishment of their whereabouts on a continuing

basis.

(c) - ANY INFORMATION DEVELOPED DURING THE COURSE OF

SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INTEREST TO OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS IN THE EXECU-

TIVE BRANCH IS PROMPTLY DISSEMINATED TO SUCH

AGENCIES.

1.

Thousands of investigations are conducted

annually and reports disseminated to appro-

priate agencies of the Exeuctive Branch of the

Government on individuals who are not included

on the security Index but whose activities are

of interest to other agencies.

2.

In the same manner, we are continually alert

for indications of criminal violations of

Federal statutes on the part of individual

subjects of security investigations.

6. - GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL OPERATIONS

A. - GENERAL STATEMENT: The total of 564,493 investiga-

tive matters received during the fiscal year 1964 in the over-all

criminal and civil category is an increase of 33,248 matters over

the volume received during the prior year. Our work in this area

of operations has been steadily Increasing for many years

This

has been brought about by two main factors. First, there

has been

the steady receipt of added responsibilities and the broadening

of our jurisdiction through legislative enactments and other

official directives. Secondly, our growing work loads in

the

criminal classifications mirror the increasing volume of serious

crime which confronts the Nation's law enforcement agencies at all

levels.

During the calendar year 1963, serious crime in this

country, according to reports from the Nation's local police

agencies, registered a substantial 10% Increase in volume

over

1962. The shocking rise in crime over the last few years

is

clearly illustrated by the fact that since 1958 the Nation's

population rise of 8% has been outstripped by a 40% increase in

crime. In other words, during this period crime in the United

States has increased five times faster than our population growth.

The continuing mounting of the volume of crime 1s reflected in a

drastic 15% rise in serious crimes in this country during the first

six months of 1964 over the same period in 1963.

At the same time, we continue to be called upon with

increasing frequency to make special-type investigations which

are always accompanied with extraordinary demands upon our avail-

7-56

able manpower and resources.

Doc1d: 32206450 Page 91

## Page 92

III. - FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

6. - GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL OPERATIONS

Such factors as these point to a continuing increase in

the volume of work which the FBI can expect to receive in the

criminal and civil categories during the fiscal year 1966.

Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicles

Throughout the Nation during the calendar year 1963

nearly 400,000 automobiles were stolen, an increase of 11% over

1962. Over the past six years the volume of auto theft crimes

has posted a 39% increase.

A number of these stolen cars are moved across State

lines and even into foreign countries, bringing about a Federal

violation under the jurisdiction of the FBI. The growing auto

theft problem 1s reflected in the record high 19,856 such vehicles

which were located and recovered in FBI cases during the fiscal

year 1963. Some of these vehicles were handled by professional

auto thieves who alter the identifying features of the stolen

vehicles and then sell them to the unsuspecting public. At the

close of the fiscal year 1964, there were some 70 such auto theft

rings under investigation by the FBI. These Investigations are

involved, widespread and time-consuming.

There 1s no indication but that the upward trend of this

work will continue.

Fugitive Felon Act

The record high 3,062 fugitives located during the fis-

cal year 1964 under the Fugitive Felon Act clearly shows the great

cooperative strides we have been enabled to make as the result of

legislation broadening our jurisdiction to aid local law

7-57

## Page 93

6. - GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL OPERATIONS

enforcement in locating far-ranging fugitives. During the fiscal

year 1961 and prior to the new amendment enacted by Congress, a

total of 1,418 such unlawful flight fugitives were located.

The broadened jurisdiction resulting from the amendment

of the Fugitive Felon Act on October 4, 1961, has, of course,

resulted in substantial additions to our work load volume. This

is not only reflected in the growing number of fugitives located

(the number climbed from 1,418 in 1961, to 1,878 in 1962, to 2,514

in 1963, and then to the new record high 3,062 during the fiscal

year 1964) but also in the total of 7,958 new

cases which have been

opened as of August 1, 1964, under the provisions of the new

amendment.

It is fully expected that the volume of work accruing

under the provisions of the Fugitive Felon Act will continue to

mount.

Bank Robbery

The fiscal year 1964 witnessed the largest number of

violations of the Federal Bank Robbery and Incidental Crimes

Statute in our Nation's history. The 1,624 violations received

for handling reflected an increase of 253. offenses, or 18%, over

the previous year and included 1,014 robberies, 412 burglaries

and 198 larcenies of banks, credit unions and savings and loan

associations.

such violations place growing demands upon our avail-

able personnel, but our accomplishments reflect the results of the

investigative drive which has been mounted against this vicious

7-58

DocId: 32206450 Page 93

III. - FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

6. - GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL OPERATIONS

crime. During the fiscal year 1964, convictions rose to 702, or

24%, over the prior year and 203. fugitives were located as com-

pared to 149 during 1963.

Organized Crime and Racketeering

Investigations of organized crime are divided into two

main phases: (1) Intelligence operations, such as investigations

to identify the hoodlums engaged in organized crime and to trace

various secret and illicit sources of income by which the hoodlums

support their criminal structures. (2) Prosecutive operations at

local, State and Federal levels with as much cooperation as

possible between all three. In fulfilling its obligations in

this respect, the FBI 1s conducting approximately 5,000 investiga-

tions Into the various aspects of organized crime and 1s working

closely with other law enforcement groups engaged in the same

field of endeavor.

During the fiscal year 1964, for example, the FBI

disseminated 187,014 Items of criminal intelligence Information to

these other agencies, an increase of 49,273 over the number of

similar Items furnished during the previous year.

With the ald of three antigambling statutes enacted in

September, 1961, the FBI has succeeded in attacking many inter-

state sources of gambling revenue upon which the professional

criminals have come to count. Under these statutes, during the

fiscal year 1964, 56 individuals were convicted and more than

$91,000 in fines were imposed. At the close of the fiscal year,

over 150 other individuals were awaiting trial for violations

DocId: 32206450 Page 94

## Page 95

III. - FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

6. - GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL OPERATIONS

these statutes.

Our work load has been substantially increased through

the drive on organized crime, a total of 15,924 new cases having

been opened as of August 1, 1964, under the three antigambling

statutes alone.

C1v1] Rights

A record high 3,340 civil rights cases were handled

during the fiscal year 1964. This 1s an Increase of 648, or 24%,

over the heavy volume of such cases handled during the prior year

and marks a continuation of the sharp upward climb in this work,

which trend has now extended over a number of years. The heavy

Impact of this work is evidenced when it is considered that there

has been a 139% increase in the number of civil rights cases

handled in just the past five years. In 1960 there were 1,398

cases. This climbed to 1,813 in 1961 and to 2,085 In 1962. In

1963 the volume mounted to 2,692 and climbed to a new record high

of 3,340 cases in 1964.

These are matters which require Immediate handling and

in many Instances involve the extraordinary assignment of man-

power and other resources.

Civ11 Rights Act of 1964

With the enactment of the Clvil Rights Act of 1964 on

July 2, 1964, numerous new provisions dealing with civil rights

matters became effective, such as those concerned with public

accommodations, public facillties and public education. This new

legislation has sharply increased our work in this area of our

7-60

## Page 96

III. - FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

6. - GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL OPERATIONS

operations. Our work loads will continue to mount through new

work accruing under such provisions as these:

Public Accommodations: Section 201 of the Act provides

for injunctive relief against discrimination because of race,

color, religion or national origin in numerous places of public

accommodation, such as hotels, restaurants, places of amusement

and service stations which meet certain conditions, such as that

the operations affect interstate commerce. Not only may civil

rellef be sought by the person aggrieved but the court may permit

the Attorney General to intervene 1f he certifies the matter 1s

of general public importance. Further, the Attorney General may

institute civil action when there is a pattern of resistance to

the provisions of this section of the Act. The Act, in addition

to authorizing the Attorney General to file suit seeking injunctive

relief against segregated public accommodations, also authorizes

him to seek injunctions against anyone who interferes with efforts

to

Integrate these establishments.

With a tremendous number of public accommodation-type

business establishments involved, we expect that a substantial

number of complaints will be received for investigation.

Public Facilities: A public facility refers to such

establishments as libraries and parks. Section 301 of the Civil

Rights Act of 1964 provides that upon receipt of a written com-

plaint from an aggrieved person that because of race, color, reli-

gion or national origin he 1s being denied equal utilization of any

public facility, the Attorney General may Institute a civil suit

7-61

## Page 97

III. - FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

6. - GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL OPERATIONS

if the complainant is unable to initiate and maintain legal

proceedings and the institution of action will materially further

the orderly progress of desegregation in public facilities.

We expect to be called upon to handle the investigation

of numerous matters arising under the purview of this section.

Public Education: Section 407 of the Act provides that

upon receipt of a written complaint from a parent or group of

parents that his or their minor children as a class are being

denied equal protection under the laws by a school board or upon

receipt of a written complaint from an aggrieved person or his

parent that he has been denied admission to or not permitted to

continue in a public college by reason of race, color, religion

or national origin, the Attorney General may

institute

a civil suit.

Again, the Bureau expects to be called upon to handie

many complaints arising under the purview of the public education

section of the Act.

The Bureau has neither the available funds nor personnel

to absorb any of the new work resulting from this new legislation.

Accordingly, a supplemental request is being submitted for funds

which will provide for an additional 330 employees (200 agents,

130 clerks) in both the fiscal years 1965 and 1966.

CRIMINAL AND SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY

1. - GENERAL STATEMENT: Continuing an upward trend which

has not been interrupted for over a decade, a new record high of

257,060 scientific examinations were handled by the FBI Laboratory

during the fiscal year 1964. The work is expected to continue to

Increase with an estimated 259,000 examinations to be received

for handling during the fiscal year 1966.

The FBI Laboratory cooperates closely with municipal,

county and State law enforcement authorities throughout the Nation

as well as with other Federal agencies. Its services, including

the court testimony of its expert staff, are cost-free to all duly

constituted law enforcement agencies and other federal agencies

which desire to utilize the technical and scientific assistance

of this outstanding laboratory. The wide extent of this cooperative

assistance is reflected in the fact that during the fiscal year

1964 scientific examinations of evidence were made on the basis of

requests emanating from all 50 States, the District of Columbia,

Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Canada, Bermuda and Mexico, as

well as from numerous Federal agencies. At the same time, the

Laboratory made many examinations in connection with the work

arising in matters under the Investigative jurisdiction of the

FBI. Actually, applications of science

by the FBI Laboratory

have grown to the point where the Laboratory now has an active

part in practically every major undertaking by the Bureau.

An important part of the Laboratory's work is related

to security work; to technical problems bearing upon espionage

and other highly confidential investigations in the field; to

radio communications and electronics matters; and to the applica-

tion of cryptanalysis in seeking invaluable intelligence through

communications channels.

TRAINING AND INSPECTIONAL SERVICES

1. - GENERAL STATEMENT: The duties and responsibilities

of the FBI have grown and become more complex over the years. At

the same time, there has been an expansion in the volume of work

received for handling in all major areas of operation. In fact,

the entire law enforcement profession has seen its responsibillties

and work loads mount to higher and higher peaks since the end of

World War II. This makes 1t necessary that our staff be kept con-

stantly informed of the changing tactics of the criminal and the

subversive, the receipt of new responsibillties, the development

of new techniques and procedures, and the like. Such factors as

these have long underscored the fact that training is vital 1f

our investigative and administrative operations as

well as the

cooperative efforts of the law enforcement profession are to be

effective. Our continuing program of training has been an inte-

gral part of our operations for many years and this is considered

to be one of the important factors contributing to the high per-

formance standards of FBI personnel.

At the same time, through a program of inspection, a

constant re-evaluation is being made of our investigative and

'administrative operations. This

aids in the attainment of maximum

standards of production, in the streamlining of investigative oper-

ations, in the correction of delinquencies, and in the curtailment

of expenditures.

Training in the FBI includes the training of the newly

appointed agents, the follow-up in-service training given from time

to time for the experienced investigative staff, and the specialized

training schools which are held to meet the needs as they arise.

TRAINING AND INSPECTIONAL SERVICES

It also includes the cooperative assistance whioh the

Bureau provides, upon request, in the training of police officers

of local law enforcement organizations throughout the Nation. During

the fiscal year 1964, the FBI participated in 4,163 such police

training schools which were attended by a total of 117,275 police

officers. The FBI also conducts law enforcement conferences on a

natiopwide basis dealing with pressing law enforcement problems

confronting the law enforcement profession as a whole. The 1964

conferences were concerned with matters growing out of the fleeing

felon problem as well as a detailed discussion of the newly enacted

C1V11 Rights Act of 1964 and Its relationship to law enforcement

at all levels. Such conferences are designed to enhance the ef-

fectiveness of law enforcement through understanding and cooperation

in matters of mutual Interest and to provide better public protec-

tion for every community.

Another cooperative training activity which the Bureau

conducts is the FBI National Academy. The graduation of the 73rd

Session on June 3, 1964, brought the total number of Academy

graduates to 4,546, Including 82 law enforcement officers from

a total of 28 different foreign countries throughout the world.

Over 29% of the graduates now actively engaged in law enforcement

occupy positions as the executive heads of their respective

agencies.

TRAINING AND INSPECTIONAL SERVICES

Much of the training for the police officers attending

the FBI National Academy and for the training programs for Bureau

personnel at the Seat of Government is conducted at the Bureau's

facllities located at the Marine Corps School base, Quantico,

Virginia. These facilities Include the Bureau's modern firearms

ranges which are used to provide firearms training of new agents;

agents attending in-service schools; those agents assigned to

the Bureau headquarters, Washington Field Office and the Richmond,

Virginia, Office; as well as those law enforcement officers at-

tending the FBI National Academy•
