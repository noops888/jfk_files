(A) INTRODUCTION:

Reference is made to previous reports in this case, particularly to my memorandum

report dated June 22, 1964.

(8) GENERAL INQUIRIES:

On June 22, 1954 interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Herman at 21 Bond Lane, |

Hicksville, I. I., N. Y. They stated they had rented a room to Thomas Arthur Vallee

between 1961 and 1962 and that he left sometime during 1962 without leaving a forward-

ing address.

They knew very little about the subject stating they did not become

friendly with their roomers. Mr. Herman advised, however, that he had engaged in a few

conversations with him and recalled he mentioned he had been in the Army where he

acquired a case of battle fatigue, that he came from Chicago, that he had two sisters

one of whoin was residing somewhere in Canada and that his parents were deceasedÂ»

Mr. and Mrs. Herman stated that the subject paid his rent promotiy, that he was a very

quiet young man who kept to his room, that he had never been the cause of any trouble

and that they believed him to have a fine character.

Mr. Herman stated the subject had

worked as a printer for the Sorg Printing Company in Westbury, I. I., N. I.

Investigation in Westbury, I. I., N. Y. on June 24, 1964 disclosed that Camera

Graphics, mentioned in my memorandum report dated June 22, 1964, was a subsidiary of

the Sorg

Printing Company and that the company's offices were now located at
