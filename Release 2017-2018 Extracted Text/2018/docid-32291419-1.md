Re Dallas letter to Bureau, 2/8/63.

On 2/20/63, following their arrest by Dallas police

Officers,

on charges of bookmaking, and on InIormatIOn

furnished the PD by the Dallas office, MARVIN C. CoX and

SHERMAN FRANKLIN LITTLE Were interviewed by Bureau Agents.

COX is a runner for LITTLE'S bookmaking operation in Dallas,

and LITTLE is the subject of Dallas file 162-129, captioned

"SHERMAN FRANKLIN LITTLE, aka., IGA," Dallas origin.

Both men were

very uncooperative and non-committal

In fact both disdaimed any such activity on their parts.

On 2/28/63, JAMES CHILTON, subject of Dallas

file 165-103 was interviewed by Bureau Agents at his used

car lot, Dallas. CHILTON was very cordial and appeared to

be cooperative.

He admitted acquaintanceship with numerous

Dallas area gamblers and bookmakers, and furnished pertinent

background information as to gambling in the Dallas area.

prior to the interview no information had been developed

that CHILTON was in violation of any Federal anti-gambling

statutes. The ITWI investigation has been discontinued and

a new 137 case re CHILTON, has been opened by the Dallas office.

On 3/6/63, WILLIAM HOWARD COOPER, subject of

Dallas file 162-208, was interviewed by Bureau Agents at his

place of business, a Dallas private club.

This was the secon

interview of COOPER.

Information developed by the Dallas

Office, that could cause local authorities to take action

against COOPER's private club operation, was made known to

COOPER.
