THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B. of Chapter III, CSHB. 70-1-1, 27 0 tober 1966

• I. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of informat on about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of suflicient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, membe s of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on il om a volune of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

• 2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as idéntifying file num! er for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 2)l opening. form (Form

331) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i.e., per-

sonal bistory, current status, and prospects.

c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record geneiated by the opening of

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and

stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved' for special listings.

d. Main Inder Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below.

When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref

erence consolidated.

e. Ol Code: a tvo letter symbol used in conji nction with the 201 per-

sonality records in the 201 system to record the as ociation of an individual

with organizations or activities of operational intere.t. Of codes cover intelli-

gence and security service affiliation, whether staf or agent, or known

Or

suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI

codes for use by components:

• (1) general Ol codes (Attachment 4)

(2) 0I codes assigned to a specifie compone it for intelligence services

or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be establis ied by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the compon nt Records Management

Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned tivo Ol codes. A : OI code may be assigned

when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Fo: m 831) is initiated (see.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogativ. of an operational com-

ponent, in coordination with the Information Services (iroup. An opening creates

a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing

of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be

opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this

handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Cenerally dossiers are opened on

persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-

sons of operational interest to the Operations Dire torate, specificall; those

persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals

are requested (see exception belosv). 201 files are not to be opened on staff!

employees; staff agents and most categories of cont act employees. Files on

nents on ISG for automatic 201 openings on cert in categories of persons whose

names appear in incoming dispatches. These a e listed in Altachment 2. 201

dossiers should be opened in the following cate:; ories:

(1). Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-

tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the

master 201 record and 201 machine listings

and to register the assign-

ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Atlachment 3 consists of sample

201 Personality File Action Requests for openin; and amending 201's. A field

station may request the opening of a 201. file by writing 201- in the Head-

quarters file or cross-reference box on the di patch form and/or after the

subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telej ouch request for a 201 opening

is made by indicating 201- in the file number lis e. A cable request is made by

placing 201- after the term "File" on the last lie of the transmission. IP/AN

All standard listings are cumulative; previous editions nust be destroyed

upon receipt of current editions. These listings aré by their very nature extremely

sensitive compilations of information and must be given every ossible safeguard.

b. Non-Standard Listings

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

(1) Country of location

(2) OI codes (organization and/or intelligence affi iation)

(3) Citizenship

(4). Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)

(5) Occupation.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinat ons. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. 'A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who were born in Germany betwen the years 1915

and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are ran citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigne the OI code AA.

Note however that the listing would contain only those per ionalities with an

Or code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA

and those

with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be ir cluded. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing vill se only as specific

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation cide for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes co

er more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers 1 lose who practice

some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters; bricklayers, I ainters, mechanics

and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all othes in this category

will be included in the printout. These non-standard listins may be sorted

(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the fc lowing keywords:

ANNEX B

PERSONALITIES - 221 AND IN NUMBERS

.: 1. A relatively small proportion of the total number of personall-

ties Indexed by the CS are of active operational interest at any given

point in time. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, and members o

groups and organizations of contin ling target interest. Each of these

personalities is assigned either a 301 number or an IDN number.

2 The 201 number serves a dial purpose. It brings the files on

these personalities into the CS records system. A single number,

e•go, 201-123456, is assigned to each person, and a dossier controlled

by this number is established which contains, or bas cross referenced

to it, all of the reporting on the ins ividual's personal history, current

status and prospects. Once the 20l number is assigned, it is used in

future reporting on the individual hoth as a file number and in place of

other identifying data. Up-to-date machine listings are published

periodically to help field stations nd headquarters desks keep bool

on those 201 personalities falling in their particular geographic oi

• functional area of interest.

of the Cuban desk on the dramatis personae. In addition to 201 per-

sonalities, such lists should contain the names and identifying data

of persons who should be kept track of, although they may only be of

tangential interest or on whom there nay be little or no data other

than that given in the listing itself:

4. To accommodate this type of re juirement in the 201 system,

identifiable personalities concerning whom enough information is not

yet avallable to require the opening of a file may be assigned numbers

of the following type but in the same st ries:

IDN-123437

These are relabeled "201" if a file is c pened. IDN numbers are car-

ried with 201 numbers in appropriate general or special listings,

where they are identified by the letter.

"I" in the "Type of Name" col-

umn. IDN numbers are not CS file numbers.

• 5. All 201 code numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters,

either upon receipt of Form 831, or of a field dispatch. I a dispatch

is written about a personality not yet in the system, a 201 number for

it may be requested simply by writing inder headquarters file number

in the dispatch form as follows:

Dispatch Symbo and No

XXZA-12345

request of stations or desks which are leveloping special identification

programs within the 201 system. The : ield receives current notifica-

tion of new 201 openings and IDN numb rs through the Field Index Card
