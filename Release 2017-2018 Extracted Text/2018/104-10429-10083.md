“+ HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

This responds in full to a December 18,
1978, letter to the Attorney General signed by G. Robert
Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, which asked
that the FBI declassify, in toto, a Secret, September 14,
1978, response made to 16 interrogatories pertaining to
Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko which were propounded by the
Committee in its letter of September 5, 1978.

Debldegi ication of the September 14, 1978,
response required coordination with the Office of Legis-
lative Counsel, CIA, which interposed no objection to
declassifying certain portions of that response.

t

The Committee's attention is invited to the
fact that CIA did suggest, with regard to the response
to interrogatory number "8", that the FBI "... may wish
to correct the dates on which the FBI did not have direct
agente) to Mc. Nosenko, to read 3 April 1964 until 8 December

For the convenience of the Committee, the
following declassified, verbatim reiteration of the
September 14, 1978, response is provided. .

This responds in full to the following enumerated
interrogatories /submitted for consideration in a letter,
dated September |5, 1978, to the Attorney General and signed
by G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counscl and Director, HSCA.

“1. On what dates and for how long was Nosenko
questioned by the FBI about Lee Harvey Oswald—
from 1964 'to present?”

The files of the FBI indicate that Yuri Ivanovich
Nosenko was interviewed regarding Oswald and/or the assassi-
nation of President John F. Kennedy on February 26 and 27,
1964, and on March 3,°4 and 6, 1964. The FBI files do not
record the specific duration in whole or in part as to
topical discussions, of those five interviews; however,
summary communications indicate the February 27, 1964 inter-
view was conducted on the afternoon of that date and the
March 4, 1964 discussion of Oswald occurred at tho outset
of an aftornoon interview on that date.

"2, When Nosenko was questioned by the FBI about
Lee Harvey Oswald, who did the questioning?"

The FBI interviews of Nosenko, during which he was
questioned about Oswald and/or the assassination of President
Kennedy, were conducted by Special Agents (SAs} Alekso
Poptanich, Maurice A. Taylor and Donald EB. Walter on
February 26 and 27, 1964; by SAs Poptanich and W. Marvin
Gheesling on Mardh 3 and 4, 1964; and by SAs Poptanich,
Taylor and Halted on March 6, 1964.

"3, What background, if any, did the interro-
gator have in interrogations? What knowledge

did the interrogator have with respect to Oswald's
background?”

There ate no retrievable FBI statistics upon which
to base a quantification of the interrogatory experiences of
the SA personnel who interviewed Nosenko on the five pertinent
occasions. Suffice it to say, the techniques of cooperative
and hostile interrogations are integral aspects of the training
and almost daily |duties of SA personnel. In that regard, it
is noted that during the February and March, 1964 interviews
SA Poptanich had jalmost 13 years of SA experience; SA Taylor
had over 31 years of SA experience; SA Walter had completed
almost 17 years of SA experience; and SA Gheesling had over
13 years of SA experience. Further, their respective personnel
files disclose the following:

SA Poptanich was then fluent in the Russian language
(Nosenko's native tongue). The Annual Report of Performance
Rating, dated March 31, 1962, noted that SA Poptanich, during
the previous twetve months, had participated in the interro-
gation of a Soviet defector and his knowledge of the Russian
language and mores of the Russian people proved most helpful
relative thereto.

. SA Taylor, on September 11, 1962, received an incen-
tive award in yekogni tign of the superior fashion his responsi-
bilities were discharged over an extended period of time. ‘The
Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Washington Field Office,
in submitting a recommendation for the incentive award,
commented that SA Taylor had demonstrated exceptional ability
in_ the interrogattion and debriefing of three Soviet defectors,
all of whom were intelligence officers. SA Taylor's Perfor-
mance Rating for the period April 1, 1963--March 51, 1964,
noted he was recognized as the finest interrogator on the
Soviet espionage squad in the Washington Field Office, which
accounted for his assignments to interview Soviet defectors.

SA Walter was the recipient of a personal letter of
commendation, datled October 3, 1963, from the Director, FBI,
for his superior work in the handling of a very sensitive,
complicated, fast} moving, and highly publicized espionage case.
Previously (on November 7, 1954), he had received & meritorius
salary increase flor his outstanding work on another espionage
case, successful interrogation being the key aspect of that
investigation. ° .

SA Gheesling, at the time of the pertinent Nosenko
interviews, served as a Supervisor at FBI Headquarters and
had considerable experience in espionage, intelligence and
countorintelligence investigations. SA Gheesling supervised
the field investigation of Oswald (from the latter's return to
the United States on June 13, 1962 until September, 1962, and
from November 22, 1963 through mid-1964), He was assigned
exclusively to supervisory responsibilities relative to the
assassination of President Kennedy.

While the specific knowledge of Oswald's background,
possessed by these SAs at the time of the Nosenko interviews,
can be answered dnly by the SAs themselves, SA Gheesling's
prior assignment 'to supervision of the Oswald investigation
Would ‘tend to indicate that he, at least, was quite knowledge-
able of data contained in FBI files concerning Oswald.

"4, On the dates that Nosenko wes questioned about
Oswald, does there now exist or did there ever exist:
a. a tape of the questions esked and Nosenko’s
nue
b. a transeript of the questions asked and
Nosenko's answe'
¢. a summary of the questions asked and.
Nogenko's enswers?"

As nora in FBI memorandum dated June 19, 19738,
captioned as above, and which was prepared in response to HSCA
Actter, dated Jue 15, 1978, to the Attorney General, FBI
records scarches have not located any extant tape recordings

ov verbatin transcripts of FBI interviews with Nosenko that
concerned Oswald and/or the assassination of President Kennedy,
A document has been located which indicates that FBI personacl
did record the February 26 and 27, 1964, interviews of Nosonko,
among others. Since no recordings or transcripts have been
located, it can be. assumed that the recordings were used by
the interviewing SAs to check the accuracy of their notes
prior to dictating/ the results of the interviews. It is
further assumed that, upon verifying the accuracy of summary
reportings of the interviews, the recordings were. disposed of
since they had servod the purpose for which they were made.
although no record! of such disposition can be found. Sunmary
reportings of the tie pertinent interviews are extant, and

were delivered to the HSCA on March 21, 1978.

"5, What criteria, if any, was used to determine:
a. what sudjects to question Nosenko about;
b. how much time to devote to each subject?”

FBI fireb do not contain a specific enumeration of
criteria used to determine the particular subjects Nosenko
was to be questioned about nor the amount of time to be devoted
to each subject' in! the questioning.
i

"§. What significance — with respect to possible
foreign involvement in the essassination as yell

as to the issue of Nosenko's bonafides (sic)—did

the FBI attach during the years 1964-1968 to Nosenko's
statements about Oswald?"

i .
The FBI, during the years 1964-1968, considered
Nosenko's statements about Oswald to be very significant elements
of his initial reportings, the veracity of which had to be
assessed in relatjon to the totality of information furnished
by him. The FBI perceived Nosenko's statements about Oswald,
depending upon a subsequent, definitive resolution of Noscnko's
bona fides, to be the most authoritative information available
indicative of a lack of Soviet governmental involvement in the
assassination of President Kennedy.

"7, What significance — with respect to possible

foreign involvement in the essassination.as well es

to the Issu§ of Nosenko's bonafides (sic)—does

the FBI attach today to Nosenko's statements about

Oswald?"

.

The FBI Woes not perceive any significant evidence of
foreign involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,
nor does the FBI perceive any credible evidence that Nosenko's
defection was a Soviet ploy to mask Soviet governmental
involvement in the'assassination. Therefore, the FBI is
satisfied that Nosenko reported the facts about Oswald as he
knew them. t

"B, If the enswer to question G is different from
the response to question 7, when cid the change
occur and why? :

The FBI haa no direct accoss to Nosenko from
April 3, 1964 until April 5, 1969, and therefore was not in
a position to make an objective assessment of his bona Fides
nor of the veracity of information furnished by him. Thus,
information provided by him, in early 1964, was accepted at
face value and qualified in terms of the source and the
conditions under which it was received. On October 1, 1968,
the FBI advised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that,
based upon a review of material provided by CIA, the FBI
found no substantial basis to conclude that Nosenko was not
a bona fide defector; however, tne FBI did not reach any
overall, definitiva conclusions regarding his bona fides
because of a lack be access to Nosenko and all collateral
information pertinent to such an assessment. Effective
May 11, 1977, the CIA and FBI concurred that Nosenko was a
bona fide defector, based upon an assessment of the
totality of information furnished by him.

"9. What was the FBI's position from 1964 to
1968 on the question of whether Nosenko is
bonafide (sic)?”

Nosenko to be a bona fide Soviet defector.

As indicated in the responses to questions 7 and 8,
the FBI, as of October 1, 1968, found no substantial basis to
conclude Nosenko was not a bona fide defector; as of May 11,
1977, accepted a,CIA assessment that Nosenko was a bona fide
dezector; and ha$ not perceivod any significant evidence,
from 1964 to date, that Nosenko reported other than the facts
about Oswald as he knew them.

"15, Did.either the FBI or the CLA have primary
responsibility for investigating Nosenko's state-
ments about Oswald? If neither had primary
responsibility, was there any division of
responsibility?”

. The FBI had primary responsibility for investigating
Nosenko's statements about Oswald that pertained to his
(Oswald's) activities in the United States, including the
assassination of President Kennedy. The CIA had primary
responsibility for investigating Nosenko's statements about
Oswald's activities abroad.

“1g, What communteation, if any, existed between
the FBI and CIA with respect to evaluating and/or
investigating Nosenko's statements about Oswald?”

The FBI forwarded a letter, dated March 6, 1964,
from the Director, FBI, to the Director, CIA, enclosing
memoranda dated february 28, 1964,-and March 4, 1964, cap-
tioned "Lee Harvey Oswald," which summarized the results of
FBI interviews of Nosenko regarding Oswald on February 26
and 27, 1964, and March 3 and 4, 1964. The results of a CIA
interview of Nosenko on January 23, 1964, regarding Oswald
were furnished to the FBI in a letter from the CIA dated
April 28, 1964, .These particular pieces of correspondence,
while not setting forth any specific requests or investiga-
tive leads, were furnished for purposes of evaluation.

Where information is not provided, it is either

not retrievable from FBI Headquarters files or is not being
furnished pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding.
