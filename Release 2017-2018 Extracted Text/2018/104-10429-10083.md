by G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counscl and Director, HSCA.

"3. What background, if any, did the interro

gator have in interrogations? What knowledge

did the interrogator have with respect to Oswald's

background?"

There are no retrievable LBl statistics upon

to base a quantification of the interrogatory

experiences of

the SA personnel who interviewed Nosenko on the

five pertinent

occasions.

Suffice it to say, the techniques of cooperative

and hostile interrogations are integral aspocts of the training

and almost daily duties of SA personnel:

In that regard, it

is noted

that during the February and March, 1964 interviews

SA Poptanich had alnost 13 years of SA

experience; SA Taylor

31 years of SA experience; SA Walter

had completed

almost 17 years of SA experience;

and SA Gheesling had over

13 years of SA experienco.

Further, their respective personnel

disclose the following:

SA Poptanich was then fluent in the Russian language

(Nosenko's native tongue).

The Annual Report

of Performance

Rating, dated March 31,

1962, noted that SA Poptanich, during

the previous

twelve months, had

participated in the interro

gation of a Soviet defector

and his knowledge of the Russiar

language and mores of the Russian people proved most helpful

relative thereto.

SA Taylor,

on September 11, 1962,

received an incen-

cive award in recognition of the suporior fashion his

responsi-

bilities were discharged over an extended period of time.

Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Washington Field Office,

in submitting a recommendation for the incentive award,

commented that SA Taylor had demonstrated exceptional ability

in the interrogation and debriefing of three Soviet defectors,

all of whom were intolligence officers.

SA Taylor's Perfor-

mance Rating for the period April 1, 1963--Maïch 31, 1964,

noted he was recognized as the finest interrogator on the

Soviet espionage squad in the Washington Field Office, which

accounted for his assignments to interview Sovict defectors.

Since no recordings or transcripts have been

wore used by

the interviewing SAs to check the accuracy ot

It is

further assumed that, upon verifying the accuracy of

reportings of the interviews, the recordings were disposed of

since they had served the purpose for which they were made,

although no record, of such disposition can be found.

Sunnary

reportings of the five portinent interviews are extant, and

were delivered to the HSCA on March 21, 1978.

"5. What criteria, if any, was used to determine:

8. sihar subjects to question Nosenko about;

b. how much time to devote to each subject!"

FBI files do not contain a specific enumeration of

criteria used to determine the particular subjects Nosenko

was to be questioned about nor

the

amount of time to be devoted

to each subject' in the questioning.

"6. What significance - with respect to possible

foreign involvement in the assassination as well

as to the issue of Nosenko's bonafide: (sic did

the FBI attuch during the years 1964 1968 to Nosenko's

of his initial reportings

"7. What significance - with respect to possible

The FBI Hoes not perceive any significant evidence of

coreign involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,

nor does the Fil perceive any credible evidence that Nosenko's

defection was a Soliet ploy to mask Soviet governmental

involvement in the assassination.

Therefore, the FBI is

satisfied that Nosenko reported the facts about Oswald as he

knew then.

"8. If the answer to question 6 is different froin

The FBI had no direct accoss to Nosenko from
