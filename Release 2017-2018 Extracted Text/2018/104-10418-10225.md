detente detrimental to the interests of the "military-
industrial complex".

‘(a European audience, Garrison said that the growing”
influence of CIA on U.S. media had made it impossible for
him to be heard in his own country.

j
3:--Reference A-says: Garrison, calm and composed,_was_
“puificiently credible to elicit rather favorable reviews from generally
well informed Dutch newspapers. "Several Dutch viewers also
commented on the credibility (“of his person and presentation.
pasty that the NTS will try to seil this program to other European
tations. '* .

4. Reference B says that the Dutch press was generally favorable
and that many comments noted he seemed logical and in control of his
facts. The majority opinion among Embassy, USIS, and GIA persom
@EThe Hague is that he seemed credible to a large proportion

Dutch viewers. THIZER 17 feels that the program created an
