CLARK went on to advise that the reason for the
bad blood between REYNOLDS and WEAN was that WEAN had
committed the armed robbery in 1961 which REYNOLDS was
arrested for in Jersey City, New Jersey. CLARK stated that
it had been planned that REYNOLDS, WEAN, and CLARK would
"pull this job", but due to a mix-up REYNOLDS and CLARK
left the bar and WEAN, having the only gun, held up_and
robbed the owners of the bar. CLARK advised that they
(REYNOLDS and CLARK) were met later. by WEAN, and to the best
of his knowledge they all received approximately $1000 each.
CLARK went on to state that REYNOLDS was angry because he
had to go through the trial, and it cost him money to pay
off some people which WEAN never reimbursed REYNOLDS for.
CLARK stated that as a result of this REYNOLDS wants
nothing to do with WEAN, and WEANStays away from REYNOLDS.
