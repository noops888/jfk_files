Mo one could do a real job in a particular area. “r. Block eamed
something over 40 rubels per month.

Mollie Block was a teacher at the polytechnical institute ia
Odessa. She eamed 40 rubels por month, A chief at the polytechnical
Anetitute momix earned 90C rubels per month and had his ow home

the class differences were as great in the Joviet Union as in the U.3.A,

Both told that they were unpopular among heir colleagues and among
Russians in general because it was their custom to criticise conditions
in the Soviet Union. Had we not been American citizens we would have
been sent to Siberia long ago, said Hollie, Hoth despised Khrushchev.
Conditions were no better now than under Stalin, they thought. ow there
Was corruption in all areas. Mollie said that unly 3-4.5 of the popu=
Lation of the Soviet Union were accepted as members of the Communist
Party. No one got into the party without having worked hard to do 805

be In the beginning the language had been @ difficulty ( in spite of

the fact that they obviously must have had a knowledge of itussian be~ -
fore their arrival in the Joviet Union.) "Russian has too many synonyms,"
Mr, Block kept repeating while they talked about the Lenguuge.s

They talked a great deal about ti +, and the source said
that there was no doubt thet Jollie was locally familiar with iew York.
Oa one occasion the source mentioned the place Leehawken in connection
with New York, Mollie. corrected. him instantly, saying’ that seehawken

was on the other side of the Hudson kiver and therefore in the state of aut
New Jersey.

The deughter sat cuietly the entire time and stared straicht ahead.
Upon boing addressed politely by the source, she giggled childishly,
It 1s possible that she understood something, but she answered jn
Russian via her mther and said that the source ought to come-home
with them and sce her parrott..

Mollie asked several of the people at the hotel if they might get
caviar for tle source, but with no result.

The source and his guests left the restaurant at closing tine
(widnight locel time). in the street iir, block tried to get a taxi
for the source, but could not get one. Afterwards each went in his
om directions

13 COMMENTARY :

‘The source. was aware the entire time that the meeting might have:
been arranged. However, he found no real basis for this.

He was also awaro of some lesser irregularities. during the bionic
wut these could easily have had a natural explanetion.

The source emphasises that they asked him for no. favors or asked
him to do nothing except visit them, hey showed no curiosity, asked
little, and “ollie was too cecupiod with what she: her@elf had on her
heart to listen cnd understand whet the source saide The couple had
vations about sicohol and did not. react to the fact. that the

quite animated,
