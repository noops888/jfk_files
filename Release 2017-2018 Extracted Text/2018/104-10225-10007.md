You have just completed, at my direction, seven weeks
of full-time servico on the GS-13 Clandestine Service
Personnel Evaluation Board, 1 know that this work has been
particularly demanding. Your partictpation and diligent
application of your professional experience have been
decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the

Board's missions,

as In the course of this assignmont you have become
thoroughly familinr with the use and interpretation of per=
sonnel files and porsonnel practices of the Clandestine
Service Having reviewed and analyzed the files of (I

or more CS officers, you have had to make judgments

and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and
their qualifications for promotion, for training required

to overcome a deficiency or.enhance career effectiveness,

for changes of assignment to further career development and
for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding perform=
ance. . In 80 doing, you have carefully studied the career
development of a large riumber of officers in all components
of the CS, both as individuals and in relationship to each
other in terms of morit and value to the Clandestine Service.

You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of
personnel and administrative problems on a practical working
level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel management
which will better equip you to handle supervisory positions
which require personnel reporting and career development of
subordinates, Tho committee format of the panels has also
deepened your understanding of the conference approach to

management problems.

SUBJECT:

1 April 1970 to 32 March 1971

Mr. departed on 21
February 1971, after having served as Chief of Station for two and
one half years, The last year of his tour was highlighted by two
extremely delicate, highly productive operations targeted against
the opera-
tion of a most sensitive nature stemming from them, This latter
operation, focused as it waa around
called for constant good judgment on how to pursue U.S, Govern-
ment interests with this highly sensitive and significant intelligence
at hand, (It was highlighted at the WH Division's Chiefs of Station
Conference held in February 1971 as a classic example of both the
collection aad use of intelligence on the real "national interest"
level.)

Throughout these operations, Mr. handled him-
self very well, especially during the latter part of his tenure when
he was under considerable pressure as an almost inevitable conse-
quence of the impact of these operations, Ultimately, Mr,
Jwas requested by the

It should be stressed that thia was a mark of

his operational success rather than the result of any operational

"flap" or miscue whatever, /

(The



fact that, under these general circumstances, he continued to
function normally, responding to numerous demands being made
on him by the situation and Headquarters, and set about paving
the way for his successor tu take up the cudgel from the best
operational platform ~~ all this speaks for itself and certainly
underlines the fine quality of Mr. Iprofessional and
personal characteristica.

In the realm of normal activity, Mr. handled
his officers with both firmness and tact, He was a good manager,
ran a taut Station, and had cut back on sevéral marginal operations,
streamlined others, and initiated some new ones. He writes well
and quickly, and he has exceptional fluency in Spanish. He moved
very well in the local community and, during his tenure, established
a wide range of contacts,

Mr. kelationship with the| was

excellent, and| was a great help to him in discharging hia

In sum, Mr. is a "pro" who turned in a strong
perforrnance both before and after the chips were down.

His new assignment indicates that the most senior

officor in the strictest sense of tho word. He is hard-
driving and tenacious; despite his seniority he is on
any list of activists; ho has tho capability of gotting
things going, of getting tho job done. He applics rigid
standards to his subordinates, but no less rigid than
those ho applies to himself. He 18 cost-conscious to
an unusual degree. He is a fluont speaker of idiomatic

Station approximately one half of the twelve month period, Since
these activities were under the direction of Headquarters, and not this
Station, the rater docs not feel qualified to comment on Subject's per-
formance of Specific Duties 2 and 3 and has therefore left those rating
boxes blank for completion by the appropriato Headquarters’ offictal.

With respect to Specific Duty 1, supervision of Station's jpera~

task and the rater feels that Station's| joperations have been main-
tained at a high level and have been an important contribution to KUBARK'
world-wide effort against this priority target. Obviously Subject's fre-
quent and prolonged absences from the Station have not permitted him to
give this task his undivided attention or the day-to-day continuity that

is so necessary and important.

COMMENTS OF WEVIEWING OFFICIAL,

I know subject and am thoroughly familiar with his work and performance.
lI concur in this report with one exception, namely the rating given
subject for specific duty No, 6. Bocause of his travels which absented
him from the Station for one-half of tho past yoar, subject perforce was
inadequately qualified to take charge of the station in the absence of
the COS, Specializing on| operations entirely, he has but a
Limited knowledge of the station's other activities and considering only
the effectivoness of his performance of this duty, I could not rate him
highor than P. This is not a comment on his capability but rather an
evaluation of his effectiveness in performance of this particular duty.
