scheduled using an office/work-room in A/l*s jewelry factory-
showroom at 31 W. 47th st., New York, “

2. Purposes of Meeting. This meeting was soheduled
in order to obtain information and identifications from A/1
revelant to the AMLASI! Operation. We were particularly
interested in detormining AMLASH's present attitude toward
the Operation and any details of or numes of likely

fn using A/l es a check against the list of litely AMLASI
confederates ich had been cowpilod by the MIAPRON group.

give AMMVMIP/1 “sufficient funds to cover his expenses and ¢
those of AMLASH during the recent three-weck sojourn in we
Burope which A/l made at our request. lowever, A/l refused’
to accept any remuneration whatsoever, stating that the .
money we had given hie for his round—trip—tickot’($950,00)- -- - -
was enough. This, for the record, represents an outlay
conservatively of some $1200 to $1500 by A/1 from his ow
pocket on KUBARK behalf, not to mention the lost time from
his own business. We believe this gesture should be
remembered in future dealings: with A/1.

6. In addition to the above information, the
undersigned discussed various aspects of the ANLASI ey
and in partioular, questioned A/} about AMLASH's frame of
mind and future plana which he may have revealed to A/1 .
after Ontrich departed the scene. A/) made several. points,
which basically botled down to the fact that AMLASII was
still not pleased with the support he was getting from the
USG side, The visit with DAINOLD, who acted in the capacity
of @ representative of high levels of the Govt concerned
with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMLASH as far as poltoyy
was concerned , but he was not af all happy with the fact
that he still was not given the technical assistance for
the operational plan as he saw it, A/1 said that AMLASH
dwelt constantly on this point. He could not understand
why he denied certain small pieces of equipment which
promis @ final solution to the problem, while, on the
other hand, the USG gave mich equipment and money to exile
groups for their inoffective excursions against Cuban
coastal targets, According to A/1, AMLASH feols strongly
on this poiut, and if he does not get advice and materiale

from USG technician, he will probably become fed-up again,
and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date. -
A/l stated that AMLASI now has his feet wet vis-a-vis
Cooperating with USG and haa accepted the fact that he will
work profitably and securely with it. It is thie that we
stand to lose with our procrastination. AMLASH also
talked about going to the French terrorist group, the QAS,
in order to get the materials and guidance he needs. It
is believed. that he was talked out of this idea, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASH,

7. With regard to the radio gear, AMLASI stated
that he did not feel that he wanted to take one in with
hin, particularly in view of the recent arrests in Cuba
of agents carrying concealed radios. [le was not opposed,
however, at this timc to ha: gia radio cached for hin,
to be recovered by him later,

8. According to AMMIP, {2 there is any interest
in having AMLASI link up with other trusted eta in
Cuba, these names would have to be Given to him before he
Feturned; otherwise he vould not trust any other means
Seat later inside to get hin to initiate or respond to such
contacts.

f
9. A/l stated that AMLASH talked about getting
aid from, or at 1 it discussing his position, with
Manolo RAY. i ho stated that he questioned whether
thie was the best idea, since if RAY came to Paria while
he (LASH) was there, people would conclude that there was-
sowething botween the two, Another spot wouid be better,
thogght AMLASH.

10. At the tine of A/lts departure, AMLASH
said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris
staffer) upon his return to Paris. (This he subsequently
did on the 15th of November, according to info received
from Paris-somewhat belatedly).

1. When AMLASH, A/1, and VENEGAS were together
im Rome and Italy, VENEGAS told AMLASIL that people were

betting that LASH would not return to Cuba. Some had also
questioned his mother on this point. AMLASH reportedly
told VENEGAS to cover all the bets he could as he would
be o rich nan. (It was at this tine, according to A/1,
that AMLASH decided that he had better roturn to Havana
