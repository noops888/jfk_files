AnTOnIO LUSSON LUZONT, BALLLO, A/l stated that he dic

not know these types

well and therofore hod little to say

regarding them. He did say that he did not cure for GALM

personally and that he vas a little "psycho"; BORDON was

OK; (PEREZ woe an older men, ca. 60 yearg, who was a

nonentity who had his rank because he had guided the CRANIA

group into the hills at the boginning of the fight againat

Datiata;

LUSSON was probably too loyal to Raul CASTRO to be

considered for any initial aotion.

- then questionod

about the identitlos of followere

•I MAJOr AMÉJELLAS, A/L atated

that it would be botter to

refer to AMLASH, as he (A/1) could only give information that

was three yeara

old and henoe not very accurate.

We did not

press the question, nor suggot names, as it was evident

that he felt that his anors would simply not give a true,

current ploture.

A/l provided the full nane of a possible lead

hich he had discussed earlier with Ontrich:

underaigned diacuesed vortoum aspecte of the AMLASIl case,

and in particular, questioned A/l about AMLASH's frame of

mind and future plane which he may have revealed to Al.

aftor Ontrioh departed the scene.

A/) made several points,

whioh basteally boiled down to tho fact that AMASHl way

still not pleased with the support he was getting from the

USa side.

The viaft with DAINOLD, who aoted in the capaolty

of a representative of bigh levels of the Govt concerned

with the Cuban problem, satlafled AMLASH as far as polloyy

was concerned, but he was not at all happy with the faot

that he still was not given the tochnical asstatance for

the operational plan as he saw it. A/l said that AMLASH

dwelt constantly on this point.

He could not understand

why he was denied certain small pleces of equipment which

promised a final solution to the problem, whilo, on the

gave much equipment and money to exile

groups for

coastal targots.

from USG technician, he will probubly beoome fed-up again,

and we will lone whatever progress we have made to date.

A/l stated that AMLAST now has hia feet wet via-a via

cooperating with USf and has accepted the Inct that he will

work profitably and securely with it.

It te thie that we

stand to lose with our procrastination.

AMLASH also

talked about going to the french terroriet group, the OAS,

In order to got the cateriale and guidance he needs.

Is bolleved. that he was talked out of this idea, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASH!.

T. With rogard to the radio gear, AMLASH stated

Lbat he did not feel

that he wanted to take

one In with

him, particularly in vier of the recent arrests in Cuba

of agenta carrying concealed radios.

He was not opposed,

however, at this timo to haunsie radlo cached for him,

to be recovered by him later.

B.

In haviog AMASI! link up with other trusted assets in

Cuba, these names would have to be given to him belore he

returned; otherwise he would not trust any other means

contacts.

A/l stated that AMLAST talked about getting

aid from, or at least discussing his position, with

ManOlo RAI.

12.

AMAS! talked about the two posalbilitios

of re-taking

Cuba - elthor thru dovasion by US troops, or

bia way.

Ne also realizod, however, that invaston was

not to be considered serioualy at this tine.

ALSO, AILASHI

talked about his ability to take some men into the hilla

of Las Villas Provinoo and taking

the suall towns of

Trinidad and Topes de Collantes.

Ile said that he and bid

men oould last no more than 15 days in the hills as the

anti-guerrilla fightors now employed by the Regime were

eX-guerillas

thenselves and knew the way to fight and

wistin the kills.

Also the Soviet equipment made the govt

forces much more

formidable than in Batiata's time. AMLASH

apparently was discussing those idoas with the impression

that this was the way to not up a provisional rebel govt

toked, at 16 Yatry dortain that Arisis realized that

By the way A/1

this was not the kind of a plan which could even remotely

be expected to receive USO ald. It la hoped that he

entire provinco) which could be a crue rallying point and

staging ground inder complere Rebel control, from which

the reat of the laland could be wrested fron the Fidellates

and the Communists.

In summary, the talks with A/l led the

undermigned to bellove that AMASil is again entering

one of his skeptical moods, one which our actione have

done little to dispel.

Too little and too late.....•
