between "new" and "old" communists.
2. Castro's reasons for purging Escalante were Almost
Certainly Aimed at:

communism,

He ce. Castigating Escalante for personal
"sectarianism",
RE. A New View on Splitting the Regime:

H aa as Castro's purge of Escalante surfaced his
concern for a balance between the non-communist —
elements of the 26th of July Movement and the
“unaligned” government leader and the PSP = "old"

and "new".

; fe 2.. To split Castro from the PSP would be difficult

and of questionable value: .

a. The PSP to gain its final objective would
take any insult and turn the other cheek.
“It had embraced Fidel and would not let go
under any circumstances. To rise against
Castro now would not be opportune, and
would probably be fatal.

b, Fidel was now totally dependent on the
Soviet Union

¢, The only hope was not to split Fidel from
PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,

him and his government.with communism, for

ai only the non~communist element of the 26th

of July Movement and the "ynalighed leaders

dad. This. conclusion did not preclude the Task
Force from attempts to create suspicion,
hostility and friction between Castro and
the PSP.

II, The Direction of Task Foreé Efforts to Split the Regime:

A.

To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement

and other "unaligned" government leaders who were for

the revolution but against communism. To date, there

is reasonably good evidence indicating that the

following individuals do not approve of the communist

direction of the Cuban revolution and may in fact

be conspiring against the regime.
