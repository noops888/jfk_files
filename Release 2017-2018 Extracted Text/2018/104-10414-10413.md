FINDINGS:

what. is needed to get a visa to go to Odessa.

The Soviet tells him to

spanishs

call 15-60-55 and ask for the consul.

The man outside asks for the

address which the Soviet provides. 1/ The second call was made about

1037 hours to the Consulate of the Soviet Embassy (15-60-55). An unidentified

man asks for the consul and is told that he is not there.

The unidentified

man asks what is needed to get a visa to go to Odessa and is told to call

back at 1130 hours. 2/ The third call occurred at 1235 hours.

A man

named ALAIRISIE (not a Soviet) inside the Soviet Consulate (15-60-55)

called

out to number: 45-37-72 (Colonial America, probably a pension or hotel but

not listed in the telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN

ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "'KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the Soviets

will also need copies of the passenger manifest. (The conversation suggests

that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN were shipping representatives of the boat

"KALONIA"). 2/ There is nothing in either of the calls to suggest any

connection with OSWALD. There is evidence that the calls were not related

to OSWALD: a) in OSWALDS's contacts with Cuban and Soviet officials he made

no effort to communicate in Spanish though he appeared to have difficulty

with both English and Russian, thus one concludes that he could not speak

Spanish. All three calls about Odessa were in fluent Spanish.

b) Marina

OSWALD in her letter to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. (reproduced in

the Warren Commission Report)asked specifically to go to Lenningrad and

made no mention of Odessa.

2. There were five telephone calls to or from the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico City which (after 22 November 1963) were linked tọ

OSWALD for the period 27 September 1963 to 1 October 1963:

a) Shortly after 1600 hours on 27 September 1963 the Soviet

Embassy, Mexico City, received a call from Sylvia DURAN, a Mexican

employee in the Cuban Consulate, Mexico City.

DURAN had a North-

american in her office and wanted to know who he talked with at

the Soviet Embassy. She had sent him there for a Soviet visa

after which the Cubans would issue one to him. DURAN was told to

leave a number for someone to return the call. She gave the

Soviets the number of the Cuban Consulate. 3/

(One concludes from this conversation that this Northamerican,

later identified by DURAN as OSWALD,

went first to the Cuban

embassy on 27 September, then to the Soviet Embassy,

returned to the: Cuban Embassy when DURAN made the first call.

b) At 1626 hours on 27 September a Soviet male in the Soviet

Embassy, Mexico City, returned the call to DURAN at the Cuban

Embassy and asked if the Northamerican had been there and was told

that he was still there (at the Cuban Embassy.). The Soviet told

DURAN that the Northamerican had shown them letters with their

Consulate in Washington requesting a visa for himself and his

wife but the process takes 4 to 5 months and they (the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico have no authorization to issue a visa to him

and furthermore they. (the Soviet Embassy in Mexico) do not know

anything about him and cannot give him a letter of recommendation

to go to Cuba (enroute to the USSR). DURAN says that in that case

he cannot be issued a visa to Cuba either (until he receives

permission to go on to the USSR). 4/

Shortly before 1200 hours on 28 September 1963 the Soviet

the Northamerican

who had been to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican talks with

the Soviet in English and Russian saying he was

"just now"' at your

Embassy and they

"took his address" but he didn't know it then and

went back to the Cuban Embassy to get it. The Soviet tells him to

come back to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican agrees to do so

right away. S

(One concludes

from this conversation that OSWALD went to the Soviet

Embassy before 1200 hours on 28 September, then to the Cuban Embassy

where the call was made, then returned to the Soviet Embassy some

time after 1200 hours the same day.)

speak

Russian called the Soviet Embassy Military Attache Office

and said he was at their Embassy

"last Saturday" (28 September)

and talked with the Consul.

He is told to call the number for

the Consulate and to write it down. S

At 1035 hours on 1 October 1963, a man (whose voice was

described by the translator as the same person as above) called

the Soviet Embassy Consulate:

He said this is LEE OSWALD, I was

at your place last Saturday and spoke with a Consul who said they

would send a telegram to Washington, so I want to find out if you

have anything. He did not remember the name of the Consul.

The

Soviet suggested. it was KOSTIKOV, then told the caller that a

telegram had gone out but nothing had been received. I/
