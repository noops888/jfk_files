FINDINGS:

1.°:Calls concerning travel to ODESSA. Three calls were made in
the Spanish language on..27:September 1963 concerning travel to Odessa: jgx3 «
The first. call:was made: about 1040'hours to the Soviet Military Attache wg spealng?
Office... An unidentified “man outside"asks. the Soviet Military Attache om
what“is needed.'to. get a:visa.to go to Odessa. The Soviet tells him to ¥
call 15-60-55..and"ask’ for the consul. The man outside asks for the
address which. the Soviet:provides. 1/ “The second call was made about
1037 hours: tothe: Consulate: of :the Soviet Embassy (15-60-55). An unidentified

man asks.what is-needed.to:get a visa to go to Odessa and is told to call

named ALATRISTE ‘(nota Soviet) inside the Soviet Consulate (15-60-55) called
out to number. 45-37-72" (Colonial America, probably 4 pension or hotel but
not listed ih the telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN
ROMAN. ALATRISTE Says that he-is in the Russian Enbassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the Soviets
will also need copies of the passenger manifest.. (The conversation suggests ,
that ALATRISTE and“SAN ROMAN were. shipping representatives of the boat
"KALONIA"). 2/": There is nothing in either of the calls to suggest any
connection-with OSWALD. :-There is evidence that the calls were not related
to OSWALD: a)’ in OSWALDS's contacts with Cuban and Soviet officials he made.
no effort to commmicate in Spanish though he appeared to have difficulty
with both English and Russian, thus one concludes that he could not speak
Spanish. - All three calls about Odessa were in fluent Spanish. b) Marina
OSWALD in her letter to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. (reproduced in
the Warren Commission Report)asked specifically to go to Lenningrad and

made no mention’ of Odessa..

2. There were five telephone calls to-or from the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City which (after 22 November 1963) were linked to
OSWALD for the period 27 September 1963 to 1 October 1963:

a). “Shortly after 1600 hours on.27 September 1963 the Soviet
Embassy, Mexico City, received a’call from Sylvia DURAN, a Mexican
employee in the Cuban Consulate, Mexico City. DURAN had a North-
american in her office and wanted to know who he talked with at
the Soviet Embassy. She had sent him there for a Soviet visa
after which the Cubans would issue one to him. DURAN was told to
leave a number for someone to return the call. She gave the
Soviets the number of the Cuban Consulate. 3/

“.@ne ‘concludes ‘from this conversation that this ‘Northamerican,
later identified. by DURAN as OSWALD, went first to the Cuban
Embassy on 27 September, then to the Soviet Embassy, and
retumed to. the. Cub: Enbassy when DURAN made the first call.).

b

S-At‘ 1626 hours’ on: O27 Septenber a Soviet male-in the Soviet
ibssy; MexicoCity, returned the call to DURAN at the Cuban
Embassy and-asked if the:Northamerican had been there and was told
that: he: was: still'there (at. the Cuban Embassy). The Soviet told
DURAN: that: the-Northamerican had shown: them letters with their
Consulate-in Washington requesting a visa for himself and his .
wife but ‘the process takes. 4.to 5 months and they (the Soviet
Embassy ‘in Mexico} have no authorization to issue a visa to him
and furthermore they (the Soviet Embassy in Mexico) do not know
anything about him and cannot give him a letter of recommendation
to. go. to Cuba (enroute to the USSR). DURAN says that in that case
he cannot be issued a visa to Cuba either (until he receives
permission to go on to the USSR). 4/ .”

c)' Shortly before-1200 hours on 28 September 1963 the Soviet
Embassy Consulate, Mexico City, received a call from Sylvia

DURAN who ‘said she had there in "their" Consulate, the Northamerican.
who had been to the Soviet Embassy. ‘The Northamerican talks with
the Soviet: in English and Russian saying he was "just now" at your
Embassy and they "took his address" but he didn't know it then and
went back to the Cuban Embassy to get it. The Soviet tells him to
come back to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican agrees to do so
right away. 5/

(One concludes from this conversation that OSWALD went to the’Soviet
Embassy before 1200 hours on 28 September, then to the Cuban Embassy
where the call was made, then returned to the Soviet Embassy some t
time after 1200 hours the same day.)
