Officer learned that AMTURVY-13 was one of the principal conspirators
involved in the plot and that the plotters claimed to possess the
weapons and ammunition to perpetrate the dead. All they required was
35,000 pesos in order to obtain a truck, two automobiles and places to
hide after the attempt was made, The WAVE Recruiting Officer told
AMCROAK-1 that ODYOKE did not condone such attempts and no commitments
were made to AMCROAK-1 insofar as supporting the plot

3, Upon returning to Cuba, following his recruitment, AMCROAK-1
submitted several pers) stent requests for funds to purchase two
automobiles, Since (OAK-1 said in Madrid that two automobiles were
Fequired to carry out the plan mentioned in paragraph 2 above, it was
suspected that AMCROAK-1 was still involved in this matter, Therefore,
he was told that WAVE would be willing to provide the funds for one
car for his operational use but not for two, He was also told to
remember the discussions in Madrid, that we did not condone AMTURVY-13'¢

proposed plans and he was instructed not to use AMTURVY-13 in any of
his operations in our behalf. In an SW message dated 11 March 1964,
AMCROAK-~1 responded that he had "forgotten about the AMTURVY-13 matter",
leading WAVE to believe that he had disassociated himself from
AMTURVY-13 and his proposed plot, AMTURVY-13 was never mentioned
again in any correspondence received from AMCROAK-1, Since that time
all of AMCROAK-1's messages contained positive intelligence and
operational matters only. No further mention of AMTURVY-13 was ever
made in his messages. However, in view of the information contained
in paragraph 2 of Reference A, WAVE believes that this could be the
reason for AMCROAK-1's compromise. It is believed that AMCROAK-1 was
arrested because of his own indiscretion and because he did not heed
our instructions to keep away from AMTURVY~13.
