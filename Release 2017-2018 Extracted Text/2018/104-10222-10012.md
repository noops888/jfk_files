MEMOPANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Services Staff

FROM : : Charles A. Briggs
DLO Information Review Officer

SUBJECT “+ Appreciation : Sau veecaeeeecaa

Ai. :

qaias As you know well, on September 19th, I turn over
responsibility for release or denial of PDO documents -under
the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The experience
has been both frustrating and challenging, epitomizing the
issues in transition from'a totally classified past to a new
intelligence environment yet to be defined. The tension in
law between protoction of sources and methods and.more open
government was apparent, daily,-to those involved; good case
law was made as we ‘sought to adhere, to both principles and
to regain, through this Process, some credibility for the

Agency.

2, I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation
for the truly magnificent support I got from what is now
the Privacy and tnformation Action Group, through recommenda-
tions for the Unit Citation subsequently awarded by the DCI,
through QSI's. and promotions, and through personal comment,
All have worked long hard hours and all, those now in PLAG
and those who have left, deserve credit for their professional
efforts in this arena; I want to express my thanks to you for
the assistance your people gave to me as the DAO Information

Review Officer.
3, At the risk of being unfair to some who are more

recent arrivals, [_want to express particular and very

personal thanks to

4. My -debt to Fred Randall has been
made a matter of record on severa Ton ‘me just

mote here that any supervisor who has had the kind of
qualitative backing that’ those two gentlemen gave me fs
fortunate indeed,

5, In addition to the PIAG efaea ee eee ae :

' | gupsect: One-Time Reciana’- Requested Randall Pronotion

: . As you-know, OB is not reticent about expressing his views, and in the informal
: career development world, Fred had had it in FRD. I've known OB fairly well and re-
spect his candor and professionalism; we jyst worked very well together on the GS-
16/17 Panel, with an interestingly identical philosophy. Fred's performance did not
satisfy OB, "and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact. It does not surprise me, since
Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975, that his Fitness Reports for the past years would
put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/OG officers. But
that's yesterday,
Today, as. 1 tried | to say strongly in my 8 August memo, my view of his work is
that it is Outstandi don't .so rate many officers. I would hope his present
ae work.could Stand on tes own merit, and project forward, oxpecting FOIA to be away of
life in the DDO with all the management chiillenge, and headache, that poses. His
present and future peer competition-should be with the A/C crowd,-not the B/O§ group--

if that hurdle is determining.

At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case if what I con-
sider the appropriate competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cycle suggestion

doing mischief to the system. Any hope?

MEDRANDLM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recommendation:
Z : Fred Randall

1, We've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency
and DDO implications. of the Freedom of Information Act and, now,
the Privacy Act, inéluding the increased number of appeals and
litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of
deponents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you
and me. The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents
must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout
with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information
to the outside world.

2. Fred is a GS-14/7. He had just come to me at the time of
the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for
promotion by FRD. I consider his performance over the past 6 months
to have been Outstanding. He is head and shoulders above the other
directorates" FI0s; I fave considerable laudatory testimony from
OGC, OLC, 0/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact,
persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded,
Protection of DDO sources and methods. This includes occasional
arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OGC and OLC
lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.

3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion
recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in tum, has mentioned it
to Gordon, The return signals I got sounded positive.

4. Ido, therefore, reconmend that you, approve Fred's promotion
to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can he cut. .

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services
- Career Service, Section A

SUBJECT 3 Frederick C. RANDALL, Recommendation
for Promotion to GS-4

1. It 1s recommended that Frederick C. Randall be
promoted from GS-13 to GS-14. Subject is in Step 6 of
his grade and has been a GS-13 since 1958. He entered
on duty at the Station in August 1965. A current
Fitness Report If attached,

2. Subject's file indicates that he has been recom-

mended for promotion five times: four times by his
superiors Division when he served on

once by th Station in February 1966. @ realizing
that the 1 14 jump is traditionally difficult we feel

that Subject's performance over the past year, when coupled
with a consistently high calibre of work in previous years;
deserves much-belated recognition in the form of a promotion.
He continti to be responsible for the tation's efforts
to exploit the Far Fastern target, and his. years of over-.
seas experience against this target have been reflected

in a re i aginative approach to operations in
iis operational activity has required

@ handling of persons of varied nationality and ‘stature,
close contact with Headquarters representatives, liaison

with the Washington Fieid Office of the FBI, and liaison -
with the US Alr Force. His performance has been uniformly

"Strong" and his handling of the HASHARK case has been

outstanding. HASHARK, an has been a
contact of tne Agency. for years, but It was not until his
arrival in Washington. and bis handling by Subject that he
Began to produce solid intelligence on his own country.

Subject's work on this casé has. received a well-deserved

commendation from Headquarters.



Subject's excellent relations with colleagues in FE

‘ision have been of considerable value in helping the

Station to adjust its operational activity in the FE

eld to current and changing requirements. He has clearly
been performing at the GS-14 level for some time and we
urge that this promotion request be favorably considered
at the earliest possible meeting of your panel.

1, Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties,
and after considcring likely future assinments, you have been placed
(subject to vour signature below) in the fictional category W for
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the Evaluation Board precepts for your grade, This place-
ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and
carecr planning may be judged against officers similarly placed vro-
fessionally. YOU ARF URGED TO STI’ THE PRECEPTS AND ODNSITER: YOUR OWN

\REPULLY .

2. In general, you should consider the following;
a. Categories are sharply defined. Conpetition
: is within categories, not between. them. Thus,
t a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifying it as B/0S:

b. A change in category after sustained performance
in a different, category may cause a temporary
Joss of momentum in your carcer advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your:

new assignment. :

¢. A category change should not be inittated for
th» period’ of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow. .

3. If you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your joh more closely approxi-
mates another category or because:you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your
home base component, a3 apprepriate, to a change of vuur category.
Previously assigned and achewledged ca ries will remain in effect
intil a fully executed actnowledyent of change is received hy the

remains only to be noted that Mr. Randall is the perfect man for the job, combining
a remarkable match of leadership,- operational savvy, legal and policy awareness and,
perhaps most important, negotiating ability with both the Agency lawyers and legisla-

transcends the DO's need-to-know practices (Top Secret and compartmented, bigotted
information must be reviewed) and yet requires the protection of our sources and
methods. Dedicated, discreet, smart,-and honest, Mr. Randall is very likely one of
very few DO_officers of his grade who could have handled this job from scratch, done
so with virtually flawless output, and created a body of judiments and-ailvice that is

computers, information managemen planning for the DO and its
current services. He is articulgte and effective in presenting
Views from the IMS/FPG vantage, hut at this level, I want to
see more concern about the people ‘and activities of companion
INS elements, more brainstorming of common problems. He is

the least active of the four group chiefs in this area,
although he has the inquisitiveness und intellect to contribute
importantly in cross-discipline problems. 1 find no weakness
here, but Mr. Randall's contributions here do not measure up
comparatively to his exceptional performance in all other areas.

In these other areas, covering duties 3 and 4, Mr.
Randall and his group stimulated, staffed out and justified
three remarkably successful policy changes: a Presidential
Statement that sources and methods information need not be
sified to be protected; a DCI policy that DO records: ipso
facto are not releasable (despite an 0GC opinion to the
contrary), and a policy allowing employees access to their
files without going through the FOIA or Privacy Act folderol.
While not individual accomplishments by Mr. Randall, they
bespeak fsen the leadership and guidance he gave, and they are
typical of the kind of case officer professionalism he has and
we have needed to help protect agents, operations and officers
from exposure. I do think it is sad to have to divert good
BO talent to disclosure law problems; but if we must, then
Mr. Randall's experience and abilitics have counted a great
deal in such successes we have had in keeping our secrets.

Mr. Randall's fitness reporting is accurate and fair.
Per HR 20-20, it is noted for the record that Mr. Randalt
displays appropriate concern in equal employment opportunity
areas: wotien comprise more than half of his group. He has
three minority officers, ‘Levels of responsibility here are

The merger of units, which “created the Information Services Staff
brought Mr. Randall and his staff under my supervision for the first
time. Prior to that wé had been colleagues in Services Staff, whose
chief wrote Mr. Randall's Fitness Report. No. change in function
accompanied the change in organization, however, and the praise
contuined in those earlier reports could be ccheed—-here.- .

During 1977, Mr. Randall and his group have continued to render
this Directorate outstanding service in an arena where there is little
glory but the constant threat of disaster. In the preparation of
materials for release under FOIA, the Privacy Act or.£.0. 11652, the
researcher treads a fine, barely visible line between protection of
operational Secrets and-revelation of matérial properly releasable
under the law. He is denied the casy choice of over-protection
because each decision is subject to the scrutiny of the courts, and
the Agency's credibility is on the line each time a judge challenpes
a deletion or the denial of a document. (That credibility is
apparently quite high in the courts. -We have yet_to..be reversed in.
appeals cases on information denied by PIAG on grounds of classification
or sources/methods. ) The research on which we rely is akmost

cursory, and from the beginning there has been a high premium on
both teclinical accuracy and sound substantive judgment. As Mr.
Randall himself noted in a report on his deputy, we have an
enviable record as far as "flaps" are concerned; in a situation
fraught with danger of inappropriate release of information we
have had only five cases where release has led to embarrassment --
out of 7,000 "possibles." Mr. Randall, with typical modesty,
uses the’ statistic in praise of others; I choose to use it to
praise him, The Group's record to date is nothing short of .

astonishing, and Mr. Randall can take great ~ pri ide in his team's
accomplishments.

He has built an extremely able and dedicated team, and he _
is as quick as anyone I know to ascribe to individual members of
that team credit for actions, idcas or progress. They respond
to his fairness with ‘loyalty and affection, and their morale
in the face of constant harrassment and frustration is testimony

to his leadership.

New responsibilities for support to the Office of General
Counsel were ‘added to PiAG's burdens this year. Mr. Randall
opposed the move and argues (and lobbied) intelligently to
preclude it, to no avail. It is to his credit that, having urged
a different course of action, he set about to ensure that the
‘unpopular new function received the same careful attention which
has been the hallmack of PIAG's other work. As a consequence,
our QOGC-related efforts, which are very demanding and
time-consuming, have the PIAG stamp of excellence on them.

Mr. Randall created the system he manages, and continues
to.seck ways to improve upon it. Our move to an automated index
of reviewed and released documents was urged and supported by
Mr. Randall, and he has been equally supportive of-a new branch
chief's efforts to restructure our Initial Review process. He
is also quick to see and to comment on the way our efforts
affect larger Agency and government cquities, and vice versa.

During this year his responsibilities were broadened by
the addition of our Declassification Review Branch to his Group,
a reflection of our recognition of the inevita
between scheduled declassification and selective declassification
and release under FOLA/PA/E.O. 11652.. This Branch will shortly
be absorbed by the new Records Review Branch of the POA, but PIAG
will continue to be the focal point for policy fornulation on
declassification of DO records.



NARRATIVE COMMENTS - cont'd

Mr. Randall has expressed to me his concern about what
may be viewed a drop in his rating from my predecessor's
"ao" to my "S." I have assured him, and assure the reader,.
that this.change signals no diminution in his performance or _
effectiveness, but rather-a personal inclination to use
“Qutstanding" very rarely. The narrative comments above
should clearly attest to that fact that I view Mr. Randall's
performance as very strong, bordering on Outstanding. The
Agency and the DO have been fortunate to have‘a man of this
caliber in charge of PIAG,

REVIEWING COMMENTS - cont'd

Mr. Randall is one of the key policy makers in this area. His
policies have stood the test up to now as our excellent record
in the courts attests.

Having said this, it should be noted that Mr. Randall's
numerous accomplishments are partly because the job was there
to be created. Within the DO he cut the path which is now
followed when handling FOIA matters. He has corrected and

. improved upon that path several times over. Thus, the time

is coming for him to be given a change in assignment; an
opportunity to use his managerial and supervisory skills
elsewhere. fle will have been in his present assignment three
years in March 1978, One grows stale reviewing, sanitizing
and making judgment calls in the FOIA arena day after day.
Mr. Randall isn't stale yet but we should not wait until he
reaches that stage to give him a new area in which to work.

My qualitative assessment and comments in Fred's February 1976 Fitness
Report apply equally today; in fact, they fall short, in view of the
quantitative and administrative changes of the past year.

The news headlines, the new oversight demands, an increasingly
sophisticated FOIA requester group and judiciary, plus a highly organize
hostile element, epitomized by the Center for National Security Studies,
has.made the PICG function all the more significant, Cases in litigatioy
involving DDO materials now number 58 and the appeal pattern is now runs)
ning 1:2 (i.e.,-one.appeal for two initial requests, with subsequent
litigation--anticipating deep analysis and Deputy Director-level review)
compared to 1'3 last year, Appeal-level analysis is much more time-
consuming, hence the backlog reduction process suffers; hence, overtime
and: fire-fighting remain the norm.” Double-encumbered personnel -‘detailin
has raised the on-board PICG total from the 18.stated in last year's FR [
to 25, The managerial task of motivating workers in this continuously
grinding and.frustrating environment was harder this year, yet was met
by Fred with the same qualities as those which led his people to write

me an unsolicited letter of appreciation for his efforts
as their supervisor. We have all felt that one burns out
in this kind of thing after about a year and a half; Fred
and some of the first people to come aboard are a bit
ground down, but, if anything, the quality has improved-~
witness the fact that we have yet to lose a casé in court
or to be forced to release a document we thought | should,

be denied.

Adding to thecomploxity of Fred's life during this period,
was increasing involvement in non-FOIA litigation support,
(e.g., ITT/Chile, the Socialist Workers Party case, ete.)
both to me and to SA/DDO/O. Additional administrative”
complexity results from my having changed staffs, while
being asked to retain’ the DDO Information Review Officer
function, Hence, split daily support to me as well as
periodic support to SA/DDO/O, poses a potentially ticklish
situation with Fred's organizational supervisor who is
Chief, ISS. In fact, Fred walks this tightrope quite

well.

Finally, Fred has persistently tried to convince others

that there is a critical need for a centralized capability
to assess the total Agency tmpact of decentralized informa-
tion release, whether to FOIA, congressional, jud
news media or other non-intelligence requesters. His
efforts are about to bear Fruit, since this will be an EAG

agenda item next month, tte

Mr. Randall supervises fhe unit responsible for developing the DDO answer to Freedom
of Information Act. and Priviicy Act requésts, both at the initial request level and,
increasingly, at the appeal and litigation levels. His organization is still less
than one year old but has gone through several growth surges as the public reacted
to the past year's publicity about CIA, demanding great amounts of information. Last
March, Randall and hi retary played the role, then the T/0 went from to
its current level of In this period, initial requests received by the Agency
reached nearly 10,00! pPeals number about ‘300, and there are currently 31 cases in
Litigation, the DDV being involved in 27. Muh overtime is the norm, in a backlogged,

firefighting enviroment.

This has been uncharted sailing. Years ef conditioning in sources and methods pro-
tection made ana of DDO materials for release agonizing. The Watergate and

professionalism and secms to have been made for it. As I said ina
memo last October which resulted in a QSI for him, in spite of the
ambiguity of the guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,
very targe volume of work and cultural trauma generated by the Acts,.
his performance has been Outstanding.

Earlicr fitness reports, in a different context, stated or
implied some reservation about his energy or initiative or independent
action, [ can't imagine that we're talking about the same man. Close
to 95% of the mass of Agency FOIA receipts have involved the DDO. I
know all of the persons involved in other directorates and said, only
6 months. into this year, that Fred was head’and shoulders above the
others, combining professionalism, tact, persutsiveness, analytic
Skills, tough-mindedness and pragmatism in sources and methods protection.
Ie suggested policy, strongly influenced implementation, and debated,
usually successfully, with the lawyers, with DDO branch, division and
staff chiefs, with other Agency contacts and others above his current
grade level--all with a sustaining sense of humor.

As to management of his unit; he has consistently resisted empire-
building opportunities, trying to keep his staff small. When growth was
inevitable, he concentrated on quality in personnel selected for this
atypical DDO-work rather than accepting the short fix to the statistical
backlog problem ‘because routine or "passable" effort is not good enough
in litigation. The best reflection of his minagerial ability can be
seen in an unsoYicited testimony from his staff which [ have attached
to this report to mike it a part of the officia] record; it is the first
of its kind to come to my attention in my 23 plus years in the Agency.
(IE some jaded cynics in these days of non-credibility doubt the
spontaneity and true feeling of Mr, fandall’s staff in this action,
and one or two of my f have, E can ce feel sad for them. This

is a breath of fresh air to me.)

Randall has made a singularly impressive shift in direction,
has changed career category and, in ny judgient, has unqualified|ly
demonstrated his commind of the position he holds. 1 have reconumended

recognition of that fact.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Services Staff
SUBJECT: ~ Fred Randall, C/DDO/PIC

‘ 1. This memorandum.is intended to state what we,
the staff of DDO/PIC, think of our Chief, Mr. Fred
Randall. Mr. Randall is not aware of this memorandum.

2. We believe he is outstanding as a manager and

“fellow worker! His sensitive understanding of human

_ ¥elationships is balanced by a no-nonsense firmness to

ef get the job done. Using extraordinary patience, -brains, -
tact, and diplomacy, along with long hours and weekend
time, he has set an example for his entire staff. Mr.
Randall's deep knowledge of operations, his grasp of
the implications of past operations on current activity,
his determination to protect the Agency and the DDO from
the devastating impact of unwarranted and unauthorized
release of information, and his Judgement of the fine Line.
between what should ane hould not be released under
appropriate law and p , have formed a major Line of
protection for the use and the’ Agency.

3, He has not hesitated to make decisions, nor to
disagree when he felt disagrecment warranted. A strong
aversion to pyramid building has undeflined his cose~
consciousness to get the most done with the least
of expenditures, Yet, his deter inaetes and firmn
based upsa an open, objective mind, willing to listen to
different views, and to change his position if he is_
convinced of the need for change. :

4, strong de. « to nid enployees in career
development re-inforced by concrete actions, positive
agestions, defined tasks, and frequent checks to assess

sugg
the quality and quantity ef work: pro:

* GSONFIDERTIAL



S CONFIDENTIAL =~

5. The nature of, the task assigned to DDO/PIC
includes the word by word review of thousands of pages
of documents. The impact on the Agency, and the USG,
of unauthorized disclosure of secrets, adds to the weight
of constant decision making, and to the strain and tension
of defending a crucial periacter, And this perimeter is.
under an almost daily attack of erupting crises. Mr.
Randall's dedication and superior ability in handling an
onerous, difficult, and complex job, filled with frustra-
tions that would dismay and discourage others, has been

truly outstanding.

6. Mr. Randall has had his finger in the dike for
an incredibly long time. He has been operating in a
hazardous, high pressure environment, fraught with
penalties if he does not make the right decisions, and
little recognized when he does. Yet, his common sense
decisions have been accepted, and have become’ policy--
policy that ordinarily is made by very senior super-grade-
officers of thé Agency. An assignment in DDO/PIC can
burn out rapidly many competent individuals. Fred
Randall is still going strong, and continuing to do an

outstanding job!

MEMDRANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT! Mr. Frederick C. Randall, GS-14/7

1. ‘This report is submitted as part of a package suggesting that
Mr. Randall be awardod a QSI for his performance since becoming the
DDO Freedom of Information Officer in February of this year. In this
context, it is not appropriate that he see and sign this memorandum,
since I want this to be a surprise. Nor, it scems, is it necessary
to have a Reviewing Official for this interim report; the DDO has
suggested, “in commenting on my oiit-of-cycle recommendation of 8 August, 75

+ for Mry Randall's promotion, that a memora anche be submitted recommending

a QSI at this time.

2. I consider Mr. Randall's performance as DDO/FIO (now DNO/PIC, for
Privacy Act and FOIA Coordinator) to be Outst: nding. As I have said
elsewhere, he is, in my view, the most impressive of all the Agency FI0's
combining DDO professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills and
an informed, tough-minded approach toward sources and methods protection.
I have received considerable casual comment about his work from OCC,

OLC, O/DBA and within the DO.

re ee yr activity expanded
in four months to an approved ‘1/0 of frith a pending request

REVIEWING OFFICIALS COMMENTS (Frederick C, Randall)

I concur generally with.the-comments of the rating officer.
I believe Mr. Randall has shown improvement in hie handling of his
Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown greater
initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however,
I would still like to see a somewhat greater and quicker recognition
on Mr. Randall's part of operational problem areas. Granted that this
is a talent that is frequently hard to develop, it ie nonetheless, essential
for all Branch Chiefs in this Division to achieve a high degree of

operational perspicacity, Mr, Randall has the ability and needs only _
additional experience to improve his focud
He isa thoughtful and considerate

Supervisor, respected by hls subordinates and he representa the Division
very well Indeed, Mr, Randall's career would be onhanced were he in

@ position to accept a field assignment which would get him into direct

* operational contact, i.e., recruiting and handling agents, Unfortunately,
for family medical reasonn he will apparently be confined to the \
Headquarters area for an indefinite period, On balance, I consider him
to be a good Branch Chief who willingly works long hours and does his
Job well, :

Mr. Randall has served under me fer slightly more than three
months and had just taken over his new position duties when
fie I arrived for duty in this Division. During this brief
7 period, however, he has displayed considerable dedication
and interest in applying himself to his newly assigned tasks
as Chief of one of our three operating branches. “This branch
which comprises
jis ‘shaping up nicely thus far under_this supervision,
and appears well organized to support the in the
months ahead, He could at times be a bit more demanding in
‘ challenging some aspects of proposals or problems at the
Branch level instead of allowing them to pass on up to the
ivision Chief level for decision, but it is hoped that he.
will gradually develop his style in this direction as he
becomes more accustomed to his expanded responsibilities as

Branch Chief. The thorough test of his managerial skills,

however, will occur in this upcoming period when all the

Bases in his Branch become operationally active on a broad

front and will require a continuing high quality of super-

vision, guidance and support from the Branch Chief's office.

I would rate his performance to date as an overall "Strong".

3. Reviewing Official’s Comments:

I concur generally with the above rating. 1 also observed in the
early days of Mr, Randall's assignment as Branch Chief, that his per=
formance could certainly have been stronger, It took him eomewhat
longer than I had anticipated to really take charge of his Branch. However,
I feel that as he has continued in this assignment he has made very definite
progress, He is now generally well informed on the operational activities
taking place in his area and has begun to exercise a greater degree of
initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross EY
his desk, Had I been the rating officer I probably would have given Mr.

Randall a somewhat'lower, moré qualified "Strong" rating. If he continues
to improve in the months ahead as he has in the past several, I believe he
can earn an anqualified "Strong" rating for this performance,

NARRATIVE COMMENTS.

‘This officer has: brought to bear on lls current assignment hig varied organi=
zation. experiences in o manner which brings credit to hirsclf as well as to the
organization. His unstinting giving of hinself ie an cutetanding attribute. The
trials and tribulations of PEAAMPART in an area traditionally hostile to the vhole :
concept have made his assignment particularly challenging, always difficult, and i
infrequently satisfying; tat he sticks to it with firm determination. His super i
visory role of our Central Registry frequently catches him in the cross currents of
opposing interesti‘and priorities but he cuccessfully calms such troubled waters.
While a part of his PERAMPAHT activities this officer's supervision of tho}

has been excellen! i

6 task under 5D 4 is largely a handholding one but one which requires large’ amounts i
of tact, patience, and gootvill. ‘There is no other Station officer performing wi

Chief, Information Servicés Staff

SUBJECT: . Commendation

1.° On 9 March 1978, the CIA Information Review
Committee took note of the excellent work done by the
Directorate of Operations in processing requests under
the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The
Deputy Director for Qperations was present, as were
_other Deputy Directors.

2. T would like to add my endorsement to that of
the CLA/IRC and to commend 211 those whe were/are
involved in the processing of FOIA and PA requests.
Although complex and time consuming, these tasks are
obligatory by Federal laws. In meeting the intent of
the law, a difficult balance must be achieved. On the
one hand, the rights of our citizens must be respected.
On the other, the obligation of the Agency to protect
its sources and methods must be honored. In meeting
these rights and obiigations, the Directorate of Operations
hus handled some 16,960 requests to date. In all instances
where a-requester has gone to the federal courts, the
tO has never lost a case based upon our exemptions for

sources and’methods or classification,

is outstanding result stems directly from the
iity of professionalism, dedication, excel
y those olved, and close cooperation with
These characterist ve contributed substantially

‘SUBJECT : Request for a Quality Step Increase for Mr. Frederick
: C. Randall, GS-14

. > 1. Qn the basis of the information presented below, it is
recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. Frederick

C. Randall.

2, Mr. Randall has been captoyed by the Agency since September 1951.
He has spent his Agency carcer in the Operations Directorate serving with

Ea: Resources Divisions. He has had field assignments
i i a

3. In early 1975, Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff
to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO. In spite of
the anbiguity of evolving guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,
a very large volume of work and the cultural trauma the Act and its
inplementation generated, Mr. Randall's performance has been outstanding.
He is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic ‘itis,
and realisti¢, while tough-minded, protection of DPO sources and methods.
In addition to’ his FOI responsibilities, Mr. Randall was just designated
the Privacy Act Coordinator for the DDO. It is still too early to predict
the actual work requirements as a result of this Act, bat it is anticipated
that Randall will meet these added responsibilities in the sane
exceptional manner as he has fulfilled his FO! duties.

4. Consideration has been given to the granting of an Honor and
Merit Award. However, it is felt that a Quality Step Increase will
provide more appropriate recognition of Mr. Randall's outstanding
performuce during the past seven ronths in a very challenging and
demanding assignment.

4. As stated above, Mr. Randall has continued to perform in an except -
fonally strong manner and 1s expected to continue for the remainder of his
present and future assignments. We have considered the presentation of an
Honor-or Merit Award; but the Division feels that a quality step increase
appears to be more appropriate in this particular case due to his extended
period of time in grade without promotion. Mr. Randall is scheduled for
reassigment in June 1965 and we fcel the granting of a quality step
increase at this time will indicate our appreciation and recognition of
his excelient performance.
