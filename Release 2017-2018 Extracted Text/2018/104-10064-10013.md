re Summary. On ‘13 November 1967, when the leaders

that four. U.S. sailors from the aircraft carrier USS INTREPID

pen The four sailors' successful flight to Moscow, with Beheiren
aid, where the Soviet propaganda machinery proceeded to hie

: 2238, Following is information on Beheiren and its involve~
ment in the case of the four, U.S. Navy deserters, i

:.@ | Origin and Development of Beheiren 7s

April 1965, nominally as a politically inde-
pendent group of intellectuals and cultured
persons whose purpose was “to help restore
peace in Vietnam." Actually, it is a loosely
organized group of ex-Japan Communist Party ...
(JCP) members, progressive intellectuals, | a
_ leftist. cultured persons, and leftwing students —
banded together in the namé of opposition to the...

anti-Americanism and refusal to be dominated or
controlled by the orthodox JCP. :

(2) Hard-Core Secretariat: The real force
behind the organization of Beheiren has been
a brillant Communist named YOSHIKAWA Yuichi,
whose conspiratorial organizational Skills have .
been perhaps the most indispensable ingredients

in Beheiren's development. YOSHIKAWA was expelled
from Tokyo University for his role as an All-~
Japan Federation of Student Self-Government
Associations (Zengakuren) leader in the 1960
‘4.S.-dJapan Security Treaty riots. He then went
into full time JCP mass movement professional
work, becoming the Secretariat official in
‘charge of international relations for the Japan
Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA broke with the JCP

3

: between the JCP and the Communist Party of the

“Soviet Union (CPSU) in May that year, The inspir-

ny ation for Beheiren springs in large measure from -
YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his organiza-
tional talents “in countering the JCP and its
Japan Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA, in addition
to being a well qualified English linguist him-
self, years ago surrounded himself with a small
following of similarly qualified lieutenants,
whom he brought along into Beheiren to give him
the necessary depth and experience to run this
new organization. YOSHIKAWA functions as
Beheiren's Secretary General,

(1) Founding: Beheiren was organized in ate -

Vietnam War by two common denominators; dedicated

(3) Respectable Intellectual Front: Wrage
fundamental Communist principles for mass move-
ment work, the ex-JCP organizers of Beheiren: <=:
kept themselves ‘in the background and lined up
:.@ number of prominent Japanese progressive
intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to
“front for Beheiren. The choice of ODA Makoto,
ex-Fulbrighter and popular young novelist, to:
be the Chairman was a fortunate move for fae
Beheiren... ODA has. taken to this front work
like a duck to water, It has given him a
chance to give unbridled vent to his own latent
anti-American feelings, puffed him up to the
extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor"
_by other Beheiren activists, and given him at
“long last an ideological mission to pursue.
YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in acai
ODA's ega needs and in. infusing and indoctrina-
ting ODA so that his words and actions take on’
sufficiently. virulent anti-American overtones.
ODA has sérved another vital function for
Beheiren by “recruiting a sizable number of
fellow intellectuals.to join the ranks of
Beheiren activists:" (See paragraph 4 for a

- listing of a number. of those Japanese who have
been identified as coe tL aanaiaien supporters
“or sympathizers.) » ‘i

(4) . Organizational Development: In its two
and one-half year history, Beheiren has not
changed appreciably its organizational format, .
although it has moved its office three times
and modified its-name even oftener. Beheiren
is not a "mass organization," because it has
had no sizable- popular backing to the present
“time. Its.hard core, secretariat organization
.is run by: YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants, Its
public’ image,-intellectual front is led by ODA,
~~and given body by a score of like-minded intel-
lectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA, who form
‘the loose body of Beheiren's activist leadership.
Under this Beheiren leadership superstructure .
. lies a base of only several hundred Beheiren a
"rank-and-file" supporters, mostly young Japanese >
, Students, Organizationally, Beheiren has no
*, formal membership system, So its base of support-_
ers is fluid and not precisely measurable, ot

definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and
made such notable strides during the past summer
that JCP Headquarters officials. finally felt-
constrained to note with concern that Beheiren
was .beginning to drain off a growing number of
progressive youth who otherwise would have been
absorbed into the JCP's own youth movement.
Beheiren leaders have tried to help this growth
along by setting up a youth section, calling it

“Young Beheiren." Beheiren's imaginative actions

and publicity-conscious programs have been
responsible for its recent growth, and this
period of growth seems to be now on the verge
of really gaining momentum. As a result of its~
role in the case of the four deserting. sailors,
Beheiren has reaped bountiful publicity, has
succeeded in touching-a delicate Japanese’ public,
nerve of sympathy and pacifism, opening a flood-
* gate of support for Beheiren from all over Jayian.
. When this'case fades from the limelight, it is +
* still most likely that a fair percentage of the

current wave of popular support for Beheiren oe

will. solidify into permanent mass backing,
giving Beheiren, for the first time, a meaning~
ful base to support its future activities,

. : eo: :

° (5) Activities and Accomplishments: Beheiren
has engaged in a number of propaganda actions,
and participated in international anti-Vietnam ~
‘War activities. It has tried to cooperate with
certain front activities in Japan controlled by
the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to
‘Investigate War Crimes in Vietnam activities,
which culminated in the Tokyo Court of August

. 1967, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed
“by the JCP, In spite of this, Beheiren has
churned along at its own pace, with a continu- |
ing series of anti-Vietnam War actions, most of

~-them related in some way to the American pacifist ~

movement, In this regard, Beheiren has. succeeded
in.cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese :

ns . contacts with U.S. pacifist movements and

effectually capitalized on this to.promote its
own action program. The case of the’ four
deserting sailors, while an apparent lucky
windfall for Beheiren, only points up the fact
that Beheiren, ‘through past organizational work
and promotional activities, was ready and capable

(unique in Japan in this regard) to take the
bali and run“with it. Beheiren ran all the way
and scored its most notable success since it was -
organized, (Paragraph 5 contains a listing of
Beheiren's more notable activities since its
founding. Paragraph,6 is a partial listing of
foreigners who have been in contact with or
cooperated with Beheiren.) te

The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and |
Beheiren

(1) How It Started: The consensus of all Not
available press reports, with no recorded dissent;
indicates that the four sailors voluntarily left -
their ship, went AWOL, and ended up wallowing
around Tokyo's hippie-land. Precisely what
personal grievances prompted the four to embark

on this misadventure is not known. But, up to
this point, the four could fairly be categorized
as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign ~
land, and due to get slapped back in line with
traditional Navy justice.when they finally
decided to stop the fun and go back to the ship.
So far, this made their case far from unique.

: : ef |

(2) How It Became an Incident; Instead of

. returning to their Ship of their own volition
or being apprehended by the Shore Patrol, the

>. four made contact with Beheiren leaders. Again, .
press reports indicate that this ‘was just a >
eoincidence, that there was no pre-planning by
“the four to contact Beheiren, There is no
available reporting that indicates otherwise.
But, once the Behéiren people made contact, they
recognized. the potential immediately and moved
fast for the kill,

(3) Beheiren Takes Over: When the four made
contact with Beheiren, it suddenly became an-
entirely different ballgame, Beheiren had
everything needed te capitalize on this:. veteran
activist leaders who are experienced enough to
recognize the windfall that had come their way;
an apparatus that could provide hiding places
for the four; long standing liaison contacts
with Soviet Embassy officials for use in plan-
ning exit from Japan; solid contacts with

reliable American pacifists with whom. the ‘bona —
fides of the four sailors could be checked;
money and organization to capitalize on the
propaganda potential (such as preparing a
moyie film for the initial Beheiren press con- *
ference announcing the desertion, prepared more :
likely. than not by Beheiren stalwart KUBO
Keinosuke, an independent film producer); and
‘English speaking activists capable of sympathiz-
ing, encouraging, soothing, or agitating the ie
four young sailors, so that there Would ed no
turning back. :

. (4) The Beheiren Apparatus at Work: While pate
many of the small pieces of this puzzle, which
would put the whole case in proper detailed
chronological order and eliminate speculation
on minor points, are still missing, the follow-
ing elements,. all part of the- Beheiren appardtus, ef
nake up the bulk of, the picture: gis: r

“S--(a)' Hide-out: When Beheiren got hold of
- the four on 26 October, they had to be
hidden out for the approximate two week .
; period until their exit from Japan could
be arranged, This presented Beheiren no
great logistical problem. A number of
the Beheiren activist leaders have homes
well suited to harboring fugitives. For :
- example, Beheiren activist leader FUKASAKU
Mitsusada has a villa hiddén away in x
Chigasaki, which was used on the night of
12 September for a meeting of about 20 top
‘Beheiren leaders, and which would be highly
suitable for hiding the four deserters. fe
Other private dwellings, belonging to
Beheiren. leaders and loyal supporters, are Z
‘seattered throughout: both the Kanto (Tokyo) ~
and Kansai (Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto) areas,

(b) Beheiren-Soviet Liaison; Beheiren |

officials for years. Beheiren Chairman
