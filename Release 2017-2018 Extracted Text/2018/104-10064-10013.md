of the Japan "Peace for Vietnam" Committee (Beheiren)

dramatically. announced at a press conference in Tokyo

that four. U.S. sailors from the aircraft carrier USS INTREPID

their ship because of opposition of the Vietnam

aid, where the Soviet propaganda machinery proceeded to

make capital out of this windfall, has kept Beheiren in the

public spotlight in succeeding weeks.

organizing a new group to promote and aid the defection of

Iuture U.S. military servicemen in Japan. End of Summary.

3.

Following is information on Beheiren and Its involve

ment in the case of the four, U.S. Navy deserters.

Origin and Development of Beheiren

(1) Founding: Beheiren

was organized in

April 1965, nominally as a politically inde-

pendent group of intellectuals and cultured

persons whose purpose was "to help restore

(JCP) members, progressive intellectuals,

leftist cultured persons, and leftwing students

Vietnam War by two common denominators; dedicated

Protham at by

banded together in the namé of opposition to the....

anti-Americanism and refusal to be

dominated or

controlled by the orthodox JCP:

(2) Hard-Core Secretariat:

The real force

behind the organization of Beheiren has been

a brillant Communist named YOSHIKAWA Yuichi,

whose conspiratorial organizational skills have

been perhaps the most indispensable ingredients

in Beheiren's development.

YOSHIKAWA was expelled

Irom Tokyo University for

his role as an All

Japan Federation of Student Self-Government

Associations (Zengakuren) leader in the 1960

U.S.-Japan Security Treaty riots. He then went

'into full time JCP mass movement professional

work, becoming the Secretariat official in

charge of international relations for the Japan

Peace Committee.

YOSHIKAWA broke with the JCP

in late 1964, following the rupture in relations

between the JCP and the Communist Party of the

Soviet Union (CPSU) in May that year.

The inspir-

ation for Beheiren springs in large measure from

YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his organiza-

tional talents

'in countering the JCP and its

Japan Peace Committee.

YOSHIKAWA, in addition

to being a well qualified English

linguist him

self, years ago surrounded himself with a small

following of similarly qualified lieutenants,

whom he brought along into Beheiren to give him

the necessary depth and experience

to run this

new organization.

YOSHIKAWA

functions as

Beheiren's Secretary General.

(3) Respectable Intellectual Front: Following

fundamental Communist principles for mass move-

ment work, the ex-JCP organizers of Beheiren m.

kept themselves in the background and lined up

a number of prominent Japanese progressive

intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to

front for Beheiren.

The choice of ODA Makoto,

ex-Fulbrighter and popular young novelist, to

be the Chairman was a fortunate move for

Beheiren... ODA has taken to this front work

like a duck to water.

It has given him a

chance to give unbridled vent to his own latent

anti-American feelings, puffed him up to the

extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor"

by other Beheiren activists, and given him at

long last an ideological mission to pursue.

YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding

ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrina-

ting ODA so that his words and actions take on

sufficiently: virulent anti-American overtones.

ODA has served another vital function for

Beheiren by recruiting a sizable number of

fellow intellectuals to join the ranks of

Beheiren activists:

(See paragraph 4 for a

listing of a number-of those Japanese who have

been identified as

"sympathizers.)" active Beheiren supporters

(4): Organizational Development: In its two

and one-half year history, Beheiren has not

changed appreciably its organizational format;

although it has moved its office three times

and modified its name even oftener.

Beheiren

is not a "mass organization," because it has

had no sizable: popular backing to the present

time.

Its.hard core, secretariat organization

1s run by YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants. Its

public image, intellectual front is led by ODA,

and given body by a score of like-minded intel-

lectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA, who

form

the loose body of Beheiren's activist leadership.

Under this Beheîren leadership superstructure

lies a base of only several hundred Beheiren

"rank-and-file" supporters, mostly young Japanese

students.

Organizationally, Beheiren has no

formal membership system, so its base of support-

ers is

fluid and not precisely measurable.

However, the base support for Beheiren has

3

SECRET

SECRET

definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and

made such notable strides during the past summer

that JCP Headquarters officials finally felt

constrained to note with concern that Beheiren

was beginning to drain off a growing number of

progressive youth who otherwise would have been

absorbed into the JCP's own youth movement.

Beheiren leaders have tried to help this growth

along by setting up a youth section, calling it

"Young Beheiren."

Beheiren's imaginative actions

and publicity-conscious programs have been

responsible for its recent growth, and this

period of growth seems to be now on the verge

of really gaining momentum. As a result of its

role in the case of the four deserting sailors,

Beheiren has reaped bountiful publicity, has

succeeded in touching a delicate Japanese public

nerve of sympathy and pacifism, opening a flood-

gate of support for Beheiren from all over Japan.

When this' case fades from the limelight, it is

still most likely that a fair percentage of the

current wave of popular support for Beheiren

will solidify into permanent mass backing,

giving Beheiren, for the first time, a meaning-

ful base to support its future activities.

(5)

Activities and Accomplishments:

Beheiren

has engaged in a number of propaganda actions,

and participated in international anti-Vietnam

War activities.

It has tried to cooperate with

certain front activities in Japan controlled by

the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to

Investigate War Crimes in Vietnam activities,

which culminated in the Tokyo Court of August

1967, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed

In spite of this, Beheiren has

along at its own pace, with a continu

1ng series of anti-Vietnam War actions, most of

them related in some way to the American pacifist

movement. In this regard, Beheiren has succeeded

in cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese

contacts with U.S. pacifist movements and

effectually capitalized on this to promote its

own action program.

The case of the four

deserting sailors,

while an apparent lucky

windtal for Beheiren, only points up the fact

that Beheiren,

through past organizational work

and promotional activities, was ready and capable

SECRET

(unique in Japan in this regard) to take the

ball and run "with it.

Beheiren ran all the way

and scored its most notable success since it was

organized. (Paragraph 5 contains a listing of

Beheiren's more notable activities since its

founding.

Paragraph. 6 is a partial listing of

foreigners who have been in contact with or

cooperated

with Beheiren.)

The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and

Beheiren

(1) How It Started: The consensus of all

available press reports, with no recorded dissent,

indicates that the four sailors voluntarily left

their ship, went AWOL, and ended up wallowing

around Tokyo's hippie-land. Precisely what

personal grievances prompted the four to embark

on this misadventure is not known.

But, up tỏ

this point, the four could fairly be categorized

as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign

land,

and due to get slapped back in line with

traditional Navy justice when they finally

decided to stop the fun and go back to the ship.

So far, this made their case far from unique.

(2)

How It Became an Incident: Instead of

returning to their ship of their own volition

or being apprehended by the Shore Patrol, the

four made contact with Beheiren leaders.

Again,

press reports indicate that this was just a

coincidence, that there was no pre-planning by.

the four to contact Beheiren®

There is no

available reporting that indicates otherwise.

But, once the Beheiren people made contact, they

recognized. the potential immediately and moved

fast for the kill.

(3) Beheiren Takes Over: When the four made

contact with Beheiren,

It suddenly became an :

entirely different ball game. Beheiren had

everything needed te capitalize on this:

veteran

activist leaders who are experienced enough to

recognize the windfall that had come their way;

an apparatus that could provide hiding places

for the four; long standing liaison contacts

with Soviet Embassy officials for use in plan

ning exit from Japan; solid contacts with

5

reliable American pacifists with whom the bona

fides of the four sailors could be checked;

money and organization to capitalize on the

propaganda potential (such as preparing a

movie film for the initial Beheiren press con-

ference announcing the desertion, prepared more

likely: than not by Beheiren stalwart KUBO

Keinosuke, an independent film producer); and

English speaking activists capable of sympathiz-

ing, encouraging, soothing, or agitating the

four young sailors, so that there would be na

turning back.

(4)

The Beheiren Apparatus at Work: While

many of the small pieces of this puzzle,.

which

would put the whole case in proper detailed

chronological order and eliminate speculation

on minor points, are still missing, the follow-

ing elements, all part of the Beheiren apparatus,

make up the bulk of the picture:

(a) Hide-out: When Beheiren got hold of

the four on 26 October, they had to be

hidden out for the approximate two week

period until their exit from Japan could

be arranged.

This presented Beheiren no

great logistical problem.

A number of

the Beheiren activist leaders have homes

well suited to harboring fugitives.

For

example, Beheiren activist leader FUKASAKU

Mitsusada has a villa hidden away in

Chigasaki, which was used on the night of

12 September for a meeting of about 20 top

Beheiren leaders, and which would be highly

suitable for hiding the four deserters.

Other private dwellings, belonging to

scattered throughout both the Kanto (Tokyo) -

and Kansai (Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto) areas.

(b)

Beheiren-Soviet Liaison: Beheiren

Secretary General YOSHIKAWA has maintained

periodic contact with Soviet Embassy

officials for years.

Beheiren Chairman

ODA has met Soviet Peace Committee officials

in Moscow.

In the case of the four sailors,

information provided by a reliable sensitive

source has clearly established that both

YOSHIKAWA and Beheiren American collaborator

met with Soviet Embassy Chief

Press Attache Nikolay V. Vasilyevich and

First Secretary Sergey D. Anisimov on

30 October.

This meeting was urgently

requested by the Beheiren side, to discuss

"an extremely important, extremely delicate

matter," without doubt the case of the four

sailors.:

(c)

Beheiren-U.S. Pacifist Liaison:

Beheiren

contacted Dartmouth University professor

I Who flew to Japan on

© November, apparently helped Beheiren

"leaders check out the bona fides of the

deserters; and returned to the U.S.. on

11 November.

:(5)

Escape to Moscow: - The four deserters turned

up in Moscow on 20 November. The press has

speculated widely and unanimously that the four

left Japan

on the Soviet passenger ship BAIKAL

on 11 November.

Again, there is no dissenting

opinion, overt or covert.

The only mystery

concerning this final phase of the Japanese

portion of this case concerns the mechanics of

how the four boarded the BAIKAL and who assisted

In the maneuver.. But with the sailing of the

BAIKAL from Yokohama,

Beheiren completed its

•most highly successful and beautifully executed

activity in its two and one-half year history.

Not.: only did Beheiren smear the United States

Government's image in Japan, gain a vast amount

of priceless publicity that will swell the ranks

of its supporters and be invaluable in future

activities, but Beheiren doubtlessly even made

a profit, financially, on this low budget operation

donations are still pouring into Beheiren head-

quarters from all over Japan to "help and protect

U.S. deserters:"

(6) New Deserters:

The successful flight to

Moscow, through the good offices of Beheiren,

has already stimulated one new would-be defection

case in early December, involving two sailors

from Yokosuka U.S. Navy Base, and prospects are

that more will follow.

Beheiren itself has tried

to keep the "desertion

mood" alive by organizing

Currently carrying out a fund raising campaign

to send an aid ship to North Vietnam.

• In this,

and otner activities, Beheiren leaders ate main-

taining ever closer liaison contact with their

counterparts abroad, such as the French "Comite""

Vietnam 'National."

In an effort to generate

public support for this aid ship fund raising

campaign, Beheiren succeeded in issuing a public

appeal under the endorsing signatures of Tokyo

Governor MINOBE Ryokichi and Yokohama, Mayor

ASUKATA Ichio, as well as the usual intellectuals

Supporting Beheiren.

In October 1967, Beheiren solicited approval to

hold anti-Vietnam War demonstrations in front

of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, expecting to be

denied and then intending to make this denial a

court test case. Instead, Beheiren was given

this permission, and conducted two orderly and

well-publicized

demonstrations in front of the

American Embassy, garnering a larger public turn

out of participants than in any previous Beheiren-

sponsored demonstration.
