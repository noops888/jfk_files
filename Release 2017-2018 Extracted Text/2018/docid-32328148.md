Re Sans Souci

In June, 1957, KEANE and WILLIAM P. BUCKNER,.

FBI #1652818, both of whom currently operate

• bingongames

in the NYC area, went to Havana, Cuba,

to operate the bingo

concession in the gambling casino of the Sans Souì:

KEANE stated the operation of the Sans Souci

is controlled by SANTOS TRAFFICANTE with 60% interest; JE

STASSI, aka., Joe Rogers, of New Jersey with 20% and a

Cuban national, RAUD GONZALEZ with 20%.

KEANE added that

CONZALEZ has close connections with the "muscle men" in Cuba.

BUCKNER and he are considered experts in the

operation of bingo and because of this were asked to operate!

the bingo game in the Sans Souci as this concession was

consistently losing money.

KEANE stated the average attendance at the

Sans Souci was small and 400 patrons a night was considered good.

To stimulate

interest in bingo, KEANE and BUCKNER

offered as a door prize a mink

stole.

After considerable

advertising regarding the door prize of the mink stole,

1600 people

were in attendance

the night it was given

away at the casino of the sans souci.

KEANE added

that the "wise guys" felt that

this attendance was a "fluke."

To show that they could

keep the attendance high, KEANE stated the holders of ticket

stubs for the mink stole door prize were told that the stub

was worth $1.00 to play bingo on the following Monday evening.

KEANE explained that Monday was the worst night for attendance

at the Sans Souci.

On this Monday night, 1100 people weresid

attendance at the Sans Souci: As a result of this

increased attendance and the promise that he and BUCKNER

would supervise the entire gambling operation of the

Sans Souci, they were to be given the concession of bingo

KEANE stated that because bingo consistently

lost, he and BUCKNER did not feel that they could make any

money.

He stated that the bingo concession lost an average

of $22,000 a month.

He and BUCKNER, therefore, proposed

that they be given a percentage of the entire

gambling operation

"of the Sans Souci. They pointed out that if $22, 000 was the

average loss per month and they operated the concession in

the future for say $10,000 loss, they would in fact have

made $12,000 for the casino.

If bingo, for a given month,

would break even they would have made

$22,000 for the casino.

They also pointed out that they could keep attendance high

the added. attendance.

As a result of the above and with the understanding

that KEANE and BUCKNER manage the entire operation of the

Sans Souci, the breakdown was

then to be:

TRAFFICANTE

40%

STASSI

20%

GONZALEZ

20%

KEANE and BUCKNER

20%

KEANE stated that now that he represented

20% of the Sans Souci he was offered the opportunity

to see the books and observe the overall operation of

the casino.

he stated that for a period of about two weeks,

he watched

the operation of "21, roulette and crap,"

giving particular interest and attention to the security

of the money to make sure

"No one was taking off the top."

He added that during the course of his

obversation of the casino he talked to the cashier, a Cuban

national who said the

"bank" for the Sans Souci was about

$400,000. On closer scrutiny of the books, however, he

determined that the actual cash on hand was $16,000 and the

remainder of the $400,000 was in I.O.U.'s and checks

"dated from the year 1"

, which he

considered worthless.

He said that because of the above and the following incident,

he and BUCKNER left Cuba and returned to the US.

KEANE stated that he was in Cuba the last

four or five days in June, 1957; for about eight or ten

days in July, 1957, and from mid-September to the end of

October, 1957. During this time, KEANE stated he never

received any money, paid for him own expenses and did not

put any money into

the operation of the Sans Souci.

KEANE said the main reason he left the Sans

Souci and Cuba and returned to the US was the result of the

small bank and the following:

He explained that slot machines were illegal in

Cuba but that all casinos, hotels, etc. have a large number

of slot machines.

He states this

was possible because a

relative of Cuban President BATISTA, who KEANE believed

was BATISTA's brother, had control of all these slot machines.

he stated that the relative of BATISTA got 50% of the "take"

from the machines and the remaining 50% went to the

casino or hotel where the machines were located.

He said that on one occasion he witnessed

## Page 5

NY 92-886

the "BATISTA people" taking money from the machines located

in the Sans Souci and witnessed the counting of it.

The total take from these machines was $11, 000-$5,500 to the

"BATISTA people"

and $5,500 for the Sans Souci. He säid the

$5,500 for the Sans Souci was taken to SANTOS TRAFFICANTE'S

office but that when the figure was entered in on the books,

it was $2,700 and not $5,500. KEANE added that you could

not ask. anyone about this discrepancy

"because for this you

i could get killed, better you get out and go home.

KEANE requested that the information concerning

the discrepancy in the take from the slot machines be kept

in strict confidence.

KEANE stated that from what he observed

at the Sans Souci and the knowledge he obtained from

looking over the books of the casino, that the entire operation

is losing from $18,000 to $33,000 a month. He stated that

on thinking it over, he felt that Sans Souci "must be a

drop or something, maybe junk."

When questioned about the

latter statement, he said,

"This is strictly guess work.

It does not figure that a joint would stay open just

lose money."

Re SANTOS TRAFFICANTE

KEANE stated that. SANTOS, TRAFFICANTE, whO

- FLA

also used the name, LUIS SANTOS, gets most of his money

from the "Bolita"

game In Tampa, Florida.

He added that

no Americans, to his knowledge, are in the numbers game in

Cuba as the operator of the game there gets only about 1%

Can CUBA

interest on his bank while in the US the average operator

gets 4% interest on his bank.

BORN IN ITALY

Concerning TRAFFICANTE's interest in the

Sans

souci,

KEANE stated he believed he has some interest,

but "fronts" for others for the total 40% or 50% that he

represents.. KEANE went on to say that TRAFFICANTE "is not too

bright."

He stated that when he read in the Ny newspapers

concerning the Apalachin, NY, meeting 11/14/57, and read

that one LUIS SANTOS ran

into the woods, he felt that this

individual was in fact TRAFFICANTE.

Cuban gambling in that he talks for TRAFFICANTE at the

Sars Souci, is Night Manager of the casino and the Hotel

Riviera and runs a school for Cuban dealers.

REANE stated STASSI's Son, JOE STASSI, Jr. Whò

in Sans Souci.

He said the younger STASSI was either a

"stick man or dealer.
