; Re Sans Souci i ra ae ‘a ‘ nah

\ In June, 1957, KEANE and WILLIAM P, BUCKNER, .

f FBI #1652818, both of whom currently operate bingongames

i in the NYC area, went to Havana, Cuba, to operate ‘the bingo fa
concession in the gambling casino of the Sans Souci? be

. KEANE stated the operation of the Sans Souci



NY 92-886

To stimulate interest in bingo, KEANE and BUCKNER
offered as a door prize a mink stole. After considerable
advertising regarding the door prize of the mink stole,
1600 people were in attendance the night it was given
away at the casino of the Sans Souci.

KEANE added that the "wise guys" felt that
this attendance was a "fluke." To show that they could
keep the attendance high, KEANE stated the holders of ticket
stubs for the mink stole door prize were told that the stub
was wath $1.00 to play bingo on the following Monday evening.
KEANE explained that Monday was the worst night for attendance
at the Sans Souci. On this Monday night, 1100 people wergsin
attendance at the Sans Souci. As a result of this ee,
increased attendance and the promise that he and BUCKNER
would supervise the entire gambling operation of the
Sans Souci, they were to be given the concession of bin;

KEANE stated that because bingo consistently
lost, he and BUCKNER did not feel that they could make any
money. He stated that the bingo concession lost an average
of $22,000 a month. He and BUCKNER, therefore, proposed
that they be given a percentage of the entire gambling operation

“of the Sans Souci. They pointed out that if $22,000 was the
average loss per month and they operated the concession in
the future for say $10,000 loss, they would in fact have
made $12,000 for the casino. If bingo, for a given month,
would. break even they would have made $22,000 for the casino.
They also pointed out that they could keep attendance high
at bingo by offering door prizes, etc., and that the side
games of "21, roulette and crap" would naturally profit from
the added attendance,

As a result of the above and with the understanding
that KEANE and BUCKNER manage the entire operation of the
Sans Souci, the breakdown was then to be:

TRAFFICANTE 40%

STASSI 20%

GONZALEZ 20%

KEANE and BUCKNER 20%

NY 92-886

KEANE stated that now that he represented
20% of the Sans Souci he was offered the opportunity
to see the books and observe the overall operation of
the casino. He stated that for a period of about. two weeks,
he watched the operation of "21, roulette and crap,"
giving particular interest and attention to the security
of the money to make sure "No one was taking off the top."

He added that during the course of his
obversation of the casino he talked to the cashier, a Cuban
national who said the "bank" for the Sans Souci was about
$400,000. On closer scrutiny of the books, howeve3 he
determined that the actual cash on hand was $16,000 and the
remainder of the $400,000 was in I.0.U.'s and checks
"dated from the year 1", which he considered worthless.

He said that because of the above and the following incident,
he and BUCKNER left Cuba and returned ‘to the US.

KEANE stated that he was in Cuba the last ae
four or five days in June, 1957; for about eight or ten
days in July, 1957, and from mid-September to the end of
October, 1957. During this time, KEANE stated he never
received any money, paid for him own expenses and did not
put any money into the operation of the Sans Souci.

KEANE said the main reason he left the Sans
Souci and Cuba and returned to the US was the result of the
small bank and the following:
He explained that slot machines were illegal in
Cuba but that all casinos, hotels, etc. have a large number
of slot machines. He states this was possible because a
relative of Cuban President BATISTA, who KEANE believed
was BATISTA's brother, had control of all these slot machines.
He stated that the relative of BATISTA got 50% of the "take"
from the machines and the remaining 50% went to the
casino or hotel where the machines were located.

He said that on one occasion he witnessed

\ APE R= foogy

\

NY 92-886

the "BATISTA people" taking money from the machines located
in the Sans Souci and witnessed the counting of it.

The total take from these machines was $11,000-$5,500 to the
"BATISTA people" and $5,500 for the Sans Souci..cHe sdid the
$5,500 for the Sans Souci was taken to SANTOS TRAFFICANTE's
office but that when the figure was entered in on the books,
it was $2,700 and not $5,500. KEANE added that you could
not ask.anyone about this discrepancy "because for this you
could get killed, better you get out and go home."

. KEANE requested that the information concerning
the discrepancy in the take from the slot machines be kept
in strict confidence.

KEANE stated that from what he observed
at the Sans Souci and the knowledge he obtained from
looking over the books of the casino, that the entire operation
is losing from $18,000 to $33,000 a month. He stated that
on thinking it over, he felt that Sans Souci "must be a
drop or something, maybe junk." When questioned about the
latter statement, he said, "This is strictly guess work,
It does not figure that a joint would stay open just to
lose money."

Re SANTOS TRAFFICANTE

KEANE stated that. SANTOSMRAFFICANTE, who EA
also used the name, LUISASANTOS, ts most of his money
from the "Bolita" game in’Tampa, Florida. He added that a@uBe
no Americans, to his knowledge, are in the numbers game in —————
Cuba as the operator of the game there gets only dbout 1%
interest on his bank while in the US the average operator
gets 4% interest on his bank. BoRN iN IWALy

Concerning TRAFFICANTE's interest in the -
Sans Souci, KEANE stated.he believed he has some interest,

_ but "fronts" for othersfor the total 40% or 50% that he

represents... KEANE went on to say that TRAFFICANTE "is not too
bright." He stated that when he read in the NY newspapers
concerning the Apalachin, NY, meeting 11/14/57, and read

that one LUIS SANTOS ran into the woods, he felt that this
individual was in fact TRAFFICANTE,

of this character. Why run? Why use a phony name?" He

felt that TRAFFICANTE was born in Italy. He said also that
TRAFFICANTE "spoke Spanish like a native,"

stated that besides his interest in the
Sans Souci,/TRAFFICANTE also has a percentage of the Deauville,

Cuban gambling in that he talks for TRAFFICANTE at the

. Sars Souci, is Night Manager of the casino and the Hotel

Riviera and runs a school \for Cuban :dealers.

He said CELLINI originally came out of the Midwest,
possibly Cleveland or Cincinnati, Qhio, and has been in
Cuba for 8 or 10 years. Prior to his coming to Cuba, CELLINI
operated a "gambling joint" in Washington, D.C. KEANE
stated he beliéved CELLINI was in trouble in Washington,
D.c., "I think-over a shooting." He added that CELLINTI has
never been back to the United States and feels that it is
because of the trouble in Washington, D.C. He said CELLINI's
wife, his brother and his mother are all in Cuba and

“all with the exception of CELLINI come to the US occasionally.

He added CELLINI's wife makes the most frequent trips.

Re sos brass, wa., soc\ogers

the Sans Souci and later 20% interest (while BUCKNER and
KEANE had 20%).. He said STASSI, who comes ' from_New, Jersey,
was never seen by him while he was at.the Sans Souci,

KEANE stated STASSI's son, JOE STASSI, Jr. who
is about 18 years old, watched out for his father's interest
in Sans Souci. He said the younger STASSI was either a
"stick man or dealer."
