MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. John Waller

SA/DDO
SUBJECT: CIA Dealings with William George Gaudet
REFERENCE: Senate Select Committee Request, Same Subject,

(RS 76-0110), dated 20 January 1976

. 1. Cover and Commercial Staff (CCS) files contain only one refer-
ence to a Mr. William G. Gaudet, who appears to be identical with the
William George Gaudet of the reference.

2. The document in question is the report of a meeting on 4 May
1962 with Mr. Richard J. Cahill, sole owner of R. J. Cahill and Com-
pany of Panama City, Panama. Mr. Cahill offered to CIA a cover posi-
tion in his firm's office in Panama. He also is reported to have
stated that he and Mr. Gaudet owned 51% of the issued stock of a news
magazine, Latin American Report, and to have proposed that the covered
Agency employee in the R. J. Cahill Company work in the Central American
area selling advertising and otherwise supporting the magazine.

3. CCS files contain no further information on the outcome of this
cover offer or of other dealings with Mr. Gaudet.
