INTERVIEW OF MANAGER AND
OTHER PERSONITSL AT HOTEL

GUZLLERNO GARCIA LUNA advised on March 3, 1964,
that ho is the owner and manager of the Hotel col Comorcia,
which is loc-*ed approximately five blocks north of the
pain cast-west thoroughfare of Mexico, Pasco de la Reforms,
and two blocks cast of the principal north-south arte-y,
Avenida Insurgentes. He explained that his hotel caters to
commercial travelers, most of whom are Hexican citizens;
that it has a votal of thirty rooms, most of which are
equipped with a private baths that for a single oom the
minimum rate, without bath, is 13.00 pesos ($1.03 U.3.)
and the maxinum, with bath, ie 20.00 pesos ($1.60 U.3.)

He added that the hotel is in the heart of the area of many
of the bus terminals in Mexico City and also is only . fev
blocks from the passenger railroad station. .

“GAPCIA LUNA furnished th e following observations
concerning the stay of LEB HARVEY OSWALD at the Hotel del
Comercio. He received OSWALD and caused him to sign the
hote? registration book, which is utilized in nlace of
registration cards. He believed OSWALD's arriva? had occurred
between 10:00 and 12:00 a.m. Tho guest makes “1e initial
entry in the registration book with data which includzs his
name, place of origin, occupation, and nationality; theres‘ter,
so long as thd guest remains at the hotel, his nase anc
identifying data are transferred to the registration »ook
page for the current date, after he has made payment in

advance for hig room for the ensuing night. Inasmuch as
payment is mide in advance, no effort is made to obtain an
exact home address from the registrant.

The hotel has - ‘four floors, and OSWALD was assigned
room No. ‘“Qvith bath) ba the third floor at a daily rate =
of 16,00 pesos ($1.28 U.S.) Tho rooms on the latter floor
are numbered from 16 -through 23, The hotei registration book
reflects that OSvALD a for his room on October 1, 1963,
which, according to GARCL. JA, indicates he was entitled
to and probably slept at #he hotel tho night of October 1-2,
1963, and departed therefrom during the day of October 2,
1963, GARCIA LUNA stated he could not recall the circumstances
of OSVALD's departure nor the hour thereof, but meroly was
Judging normal procedure on the basis of information in his

record,

GARCIA LUNA advised that he speaks a few words of
English and received the impression that OSWALD neither spoke
hor understood any Jpanish. He had not observed OSWALD in
‘the hotel during the day nor had he ever seén him accompanied
by any individual or individuals. He recalled that OSWALD
had been carrying a medium-size, brown handbag, which he
believed had a zipper and was either of Naugahyde or canvas
material, ie did not remember that OSYALD had ever worn a
coat and believed he usually appeared in a short-sleeved
shirt of a knit variety,

Inquiry was made of GARCIA LUNA ps to other personne)
at the hotel who might recall OSWALD on ¢ basis of having
any reason to notice or contact him, and le stated that those
persons vould be his assistant, SEBASTIAN) REZ, and the
maid who cleans the rooms on the Upper? tw Sore, MATILDE
GARNICA,

GARCIA LUNA stated that he was acquainted with a

few of the guests whe were at the hotel during the same pertod
as OSWALD but did aot have home addresses for any of thea,

He mentioned that several of the guests of that period are
commercial travelers and return to the hotel from time to time.
He agreed to advise the confidential source in the event any
ef those guests should return to the hotel.

CONF TIAL

BATILDE GARNICA, maid at the Hotel del Comercio,
advised on March 3, 1964, that she recognized the photographs
of OSWALD as being of the young American who had occupied
room Mo. 18 for almost @ week during the latter part of last
year, She explained that she handles the daily housekeeping “*

“dutica for the third ond fourth floors of the hotel, comprising

rooms numbered 16 through 30, and ordinarily arrives at work |.
between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., Leaving at 9:00 p.m., upon *”
completion“of her working day.

aoe Mrs, GARNICA related that she clearly recalle
OSWALD, as_few Americans stay at the hotel, and somewhat -
intrigued by his prosence there. He had very few personal
effects, which he carried in what she described as a “small,
brown, zippered handbag," which was either of canvas or
Amitatton leather material, She did not velieve she had seen
OSWALD in the hotel on more than two occasions, the day of
his arrival and the following Saturday as he still was in his
room when she checked to determine which rooms were available
for cleaning. She remembered that when che saw him in the
room on the Saturday morning in question he said "good
morning" to her in English, and a short time later left the
hotel.

She never saw him with any other person and had no
conversation with him, having received the impression that
he neither spoke nor understood Spanish.

SEDASTIAN PEREZ HERNANDEZ, desk clerk and assistant
to the owner of the Hotel del Comercio, advised on March 10,
1964, that he had not conversed with OsWALD but remembered
him clearly inasmuch as very few Americans have stayed at
the hotol, To tho best of his recollection, OSWALD left the,
hotel each morning and did not return until evening, possibly
after PEREZ HERNANDEZ had completed his working day und left
the hotel. He stated OSWALD was alone whenever he noticed
him at the hotel and usually wore a knit, short-sleeved sport
shirt and no coat or jacket.

PEPEZ UERNANDEZ advised that since OSWALD paid his
rent in advance for the night of October 1, 1963, thore would
have been little reason for contact with him on the presumed
date of his departure, October 2, 2953, and he was unable to

on the date 0. the latter's departure from the hotel and on
the basis of cisn lansuage and the word “taxi,” which he

("Ihite Star" bus terminal. Ife stated definitely that he
did not knor the tax’ dsiver and had not known or discussed iq
with the crivor or OSWALD the latter's intended cestinition,
He said OAD carried his own luggage downstairs and waited
in front of the hotel vith the luggage until 2OCRIGUEZ
returned sith the taxicab.

“We believed OSWALD left the hotel between 6:30 and
7:00 a.m., since it was getting light when he vent in search
of the taicao, He could not be more precise concerning the
time. Ie belteved thit OSWALD gave him a smal* *ip of one

difficulty obtaining a taxi at the early hour, it becomes
very difficult to secure taxi transportation betweon 73.
and 6130 a.m. bocause of the heavy traffic at that tine.

RODRIGUEZ rekated that to the best of his recol-
lection OSWALD always arrived at the hotel late at night,

“midnight or. thereaftery" but he nover aoticed any indication |

= “that OSWALD had. been drinking, He never observed OSWALD in
ba the company of any person and did not recall hio ever ueing
- the only telephone at the hotel, which 4s located at the
reception desk. HSEEEeeraetice ‘ .

With the exception of the morning of his departure
from the hotel, RODRIGUEZ believed that OSWALD never left
the hotel in the mornings prior to the former's completion
of his work shift and leaving, which would have been between

8:00 and 9:00 a.m.

On April 22, 1964, inquiry was made of GUILLER:
GARCIA LUNA with respect to the reliability of his watchman,
PEDRO RODRIGUEZ LEDESMA, and he stated RODRIGUEZ is “humble
but very serious, deeply religious, a family man, ond highly
reliable." He commented that he did not believe RODRIGUEZ
would fabricate or misrepresent information in any way.

OTHER INQUIRIES IN THE ARBA OF i
THE HOTEL DEL COMERCIO, TAXI

STANDS, AND BUS TERMINALS
On March 4 and again on April 10, 1964, DOLORES
IREZ DEYBARREIRO advised that she is the owner, manager,

ind sometimes cook at the small restaurant on Calle Bernardino
de Sahagun (no number) immediately adjacent to the Hotel del
Comercio. -She explained that there is no commercial
connection between the hotel and hor restaurant, but because
of its proximity nany hotel guests eat some meais at the
restaurant.

i Upon viewing photographs of OSWALD, Mrs. BARREIRO
affirmed that she remembered him as a young American who had
eaten several meals at the restaurant in the Inte afternoon
over a period of approximately one week. She said he appeared

CONF TAL

at the restaurant after the noon rush hour or some tine
after 2:00 p.m., always alone, and ordered his food by
pointing on the menu, apparently with somo consideration
of costs, He always ate the soup of the day, rice, and
either meat or eggs, but always rojected dessert and coffee.
She thought tiis unusual, as the dessert and coffee ordinarily
are included in the price of the daily lunch, but he did not
Qppear to understand this and always waved the waitress away
: 4f she tried to serve those items. She recalled that he
also rejected any efforts to sell him.soft drinks, which
she described as an important income item in her busines:
She estimated that OSWALD spent from five to six pesoa
($.40 to $.48, U.S.) for his meals. She had assumed he was
& guest at thé hotel but never observed him contact or talk
to-anyone while at the restaurant.

The information recorded hereinunder was furnished
by @ second confidential source, who has provided reliable
information in ne past, on March 24, 1964.

In tle area of tho Hotel dol Ovmercio at Calle
Bernardino de Sahagun No. 19, it was observed that this
strect is only one block long and has very little business

to RANON RICO, who operates a cigarette and candy stand at
the @ntrgnce to the parking lot, without any identification
by those jindividuals.

On that same street, a photograph of OSWALD was
displayed to the automobile watchman, JESUS TRIGO, who was
unable to recognize OSWALD. A restaurant without a none
is located at the corner of Bernardino de Sahagun Street
and San Cosme, and the cashier of that establishment was
unable to recognize a photograph of O3WALD,

A careful check was nade in the area of the
Transportes Frontera bus line, as well as the A.D.0.
(autobuses del Oriente - Autcbuses of the East) bus line,
which is next door, in an effort to locate any individual
who might have furnished transportation to Nuevo Laredo,
Tamaulipas, Mexico, to OSWALD between October % and 2, 1963.
