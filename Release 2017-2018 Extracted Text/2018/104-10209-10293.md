silly Maria Snethlage Santos called yesterday to inform that she read the name of killer in the newspaper

and that she used to know this guy in Havanna?

x: realy?

a. yes, Santos became furious. Felix Torre, who was also at the embassy, was also furious and said that

time she calls again, she will be told to go to hell.
