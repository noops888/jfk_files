(Manuscript - "Give Us This Day")

1. Charles WILEY called collect from New York to report
that he had gotten a manuscript written by a Edward J. HAMILTON
who was described by WILEY as a long time Agency employee. An
OS indices check revealed that-in October 1960 Subject had been
furnished an alias in conjunction with his proposed assignment to
JMARC, In this conjunction Subject had received the name Edward
J. HAMILTON, a backstop address and a District of Columbia
drivers license in this alias. In June 1963 a post office box at the
Woodridge Station in Washington, D. C. was set up for the Subject
in the name Edward J. HAMILTON, This box was cancelled in June
1965, It may be assumed that since no other Security Office reference
exists for ''Edward J. HAMILTON" that this alias may be the nom de
plume for Subject in this instance.

2. WILEY advised that he had reviewed sketchily the man-
uscript and saw nothing new nor exciting other than a reference to
General Cabell, former director. According to the manuscript, and
WILEY's version thereof, at the time of the Agency participation in
the invasion of Cuba Mr. Dulles was out of town. General Cabell,
returning from a golf game, allegedly canceled-the second or third
air strike against the Castro forces. According to WILEY, General
Cabell appears as the villain.

3. WILEY reported that the Holt Publishing Company thought
the manuscript teocontroversial to publish and apparently referred it
to Tom WALLACE or Bill BUCKLEY. It was thought that perhaps the
Conservative Book Club might be interdsted.

4, WILEY indicated that he had to return the manuscript
tomerrow (27 January 1970) and that he would call me before 11 a.m.
