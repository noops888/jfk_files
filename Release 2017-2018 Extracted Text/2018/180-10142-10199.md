On October 12, 1964 the Chief of Covert Action, Jim

Garro de Paz had told her story to Eunice Odio. (The Com-
mittee has not been able to determine if Elena Garro told
Ms. Odio the story personally or if Ms. Cobb related to
Ms. Odio what Elena had. told her) :who relayed it to “Tich-

The story is not as detailed as the 10/5/64 version.
There is no mention of Deba Garro Guerrero Galvan. The
story, perhaps because it is third hand, differs from the
previous story in two areas: The party was at the Cuban

Embassy, not at Ruben Duran's; Elena talked to a Cuban

City./ The Garros claimed that they had recognized Oswald's

photograph when it was published after the assassination.  (Ibid.)

Sylvia Duran's arrest “underlined the Garros' certainty"

that the ma had been Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid.)

Deba added that Lynn and one of the Duran brothers
had made trips to Texas. (Ibid.) She added that, even
though the Duran brothers had always been poor before
the assassination, they were both driving expensive new
cars. (Ibid.)

The source of the memo was a witting Central Intelli-
gence Agency asset known by the cryptonym LICOOKIE I whom
the Committee identified as June Cobb Sharp while receiv-
ing LICOOKIE's file. According to Elena, Ms. Cobb was
sent to her house shortly after the assassination for a
few days, by a mutual friend, a Costa Rican writer Eunice
Odio. (CIA No's 580-583; WX-7241, Entry #427, p. 92, CIA
#719) Ms. Garro asserted that while at her house, Ms.

i (Ibid.)
Cobb expressed interest in the Kennedy assassination./ One
night Elena's sister Deba, who was visiting, got drunk and
told the whole story. (Ibid.) Claiming to be a CIA agent,
Cobb suggested that Elena and Deba go to Texas to tell

their story. (Ibid.) Elena stated that when Cobb's sugges-—

tion was rejected, Cobb stated that she would arrange a meet-


_~ring with the CIA Station Chief. (Winston Scott was the
Mexico City Station Chief in 1964). The meeting did not
occur because Ms. Cobb was asked to leave the Garro
house evidently because she kicked Elena's cat. (CIA
No's 580-583; Wx7241, Entry #427, p. 42, CIA #719). A
notation on the memo says that L/l (Licookie I) never re-
gained contact with Elena Garro de Paz. (Wx7241, p. 94,
Entry #430, CIA #721; Blind Memo dated 10/5/64, CIA #576).

The LiCookie memo was not inserted in either the
Elena Garro or Lee Harvey Oswald "p" (personality) files
but in a local leftist and Cuban project file. The Com-
mittee learned about the memo from Wx-7241, a chronologi-
cal history of the Oswald case prepared by Anne Goodpasture
for the CIA in 1976). The memo was found in December,
1965. (See Wx 7241, p. 94, CIA #721). Stanley Watson
found the memo. A marginal notation on Wx7241 says, "Why
was this not sent to Headquarters?" (P. 87, CIA #714). The

Committee has been able to determine that the memo was for-

wenMARA BA Bandana etnen abe tee bee fun



Embassy official, not one of her cousins about the three
Americans.

Attached to the memo was a note from Flannery to
the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which read, "Do you
want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott
then noted that the memo should be filed. The file indi-
cations show that the memo went into the Oswald "P" file

and the Elena Garro “P" file. (Ibid. )

November 24, 1964 CIA Informant Report

On November 24, 1964 a Central Intelligence Agency
informant (The House Select Committee has been unable to
determine the informant's identity) reported information
(memo from Winston Scott to the files, re: June Cobb,
11/25/64, CIA Nos. 592-593; Wx 7241, p. 88, Entry #404,

CIA #715) he had learned from "LICHANT/1. (While reviewing

LICHANT I's file the Committee determined that the

Elena claims that

the day following John F. Kennedy's assassination, Calvillo
escorted her and her daughter to the Vermont Hotel for
protection; see also December 25, 1965 Thomas memo for
more information on Manuel Calvillo.) The informant as-
serted that June Cobb was an "American Communist" who
rented a room from Elena Garro. (Memo from Winston Scott

to the files, re June Cobb, 11/25/64, CIA Nos. 592-593,

Wx 7241, p. 88, Entry #404,CIA No. 715) ‘The informant

also stated that Elena tried to talk to Robert Kennedy when


-~s8-

he was in Mexico because she had met Oswald "and two
friends (Cubans)"at a party at Horacio Duran's house.
(Thid.) In addition, the informant claimed that Elena
also told her story to an American official, at the Em-
bassy, who claimed to represent the Warren Commission.
(Ibid.) The Chief of Station noted that he had asked
the informant to pursue the story (Ibid.) but there is
no indication that LICHANT I ever complied with this re-

quest. (HSCA Review of Classified CIA Documents .)

November 24, 1964 Elena Meeting with Mexico City Legal

Attache Officers

Elena and her daughter also told their story to
the Mexico City Legal Attache. (The Legal Attache in
1964 was Clark Anderson.) They recounted the same story
previously given to LICOOKIE I. The date of the party
was given as September 30,:October 1 or October 2, 1963.
(FBI 105-825555 Report, Dec. 11, 1964 entitled Lee Harvey
Oswald, p. 1) The agent who wrote the report (

) noted that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have
been identical with the American allegedly observed by
Mrs. Paz at the party if this party were held on the even-
ing of October 1 or October 2, 1963. (FBI 103-825555
Report, Dec. ll, 1964 entitled Lee Harvey Oswald, p. 1)

not take the calls and as a result "Alejandro" wrote

several letters to the daughter./ Ms. Garro exhibited
two of the letters, as well as a business card which i-
dentified the young man as Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius.
(Tbid. p. 3)

The letter which Ms. Garro said was the first writ-
ten by the young man to her daughter bore the date Septem-
ber 1, 1963 and the Mexico City Post Office postmark Septem-—
ber 2, 1963. When Ms. Garro was told this she commented
that the Communists probably had facilities for falsifying
postcards. (Ibid.)

To investigate Ms. Garro's story further, the
Federal Bureau interviewed Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius
on November 27, 1964. (Ibid. p.4) Lavagnini recalled that
there were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran

party, few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexi-


- 10 -

can girl who had recently returned from living in France.
He was unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it
was probably early in September because of a heavy rain
which occurred as they were leaving the party about. 2:00
a.m. (Ibid. p. 4)

Lavagnini noted no Americans present at this party.
He was familiar with the appearance of Lee Harvey Oswald
because of publicity following the assassination of Presi-
dent Kennedy but otherwise had no iaiow Teac of him and
had never seen him except for news photographs following
the assassination. (Ibid. p. 4) Levagnini was the only
person interviewed by the FBI who attended parties at
the Duran house in the September-October time frame.

There is no indication on the document that this
information was given to the Central Intelligence Agency's

Mexico City Station.

Charles Thomas' First Meeting with Elena Garro Where Lee

Harvey Oswald is Discussed

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer at
the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a conversa-
tion with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587, WX-7241 Entry
No. 425, p. 91, CIA No. 718.) ‘The meeting with Elena had
been about other matters but she mentioned knowing Oswald.
Thomas noted that she was reluctant to talk but did. (Ibid.)

Elena's story reported here is the same, but with

more details, as that given in the Licookie memo dated



sane aa

10/5/64. She said that General Jose Jesus Clark Flores

@ friend of Rubin Duran'g,, Silvia Danan Esuebio Azcue
(Cuban Consul in Mexico City), Emilio Carballido (a pro-
Communist writer-friend of the Durans), and a Latin Ameri-
can Negro man with red hair (unidentified) were at the
party. A marginal comment by this entry in Wx-7241

says, “How did Elena know about a red-haired Negro?"

Elena also told Thomas that she had later learned that
Silvia Duran had been "Oswald's mistress while he was
there." (A note by this entry in WX-7241 says, "How

did Elena Garro know about Silvia being the mistress of
Oswald?? This is 1965.") The Mexico City Station did not
hear about the Oswald-pDuran “affair” until July 1967

when a CIA Asset Liring8 reported it. /After reviewing
LIRING/3
/file at the CIA the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions has been unable to determine who LIRING/3 was asso-
ciated with that had knowledge about Sylvia Duran or Lee
Harvey Oswald.7

Elena told Thomas that she and her daughter had gone

to the Cuban Embassy on November 23, 1963.and shouted
“Assassins" and other insults at the Embassy employees.
(CIA #586-587, Wx7241, Entry No. 425, p. 91, CIA No. 718)
That same day a friend, Manuel Calvillo, an official in
the Gobernacion, took her and her daughter to-a small hotel

in the center of Mexico City. (Ibid.) They were kept


Besse be eeesy

there for eight days under the pretext that they were in
danger. (Ibid.) Elena claimed to have told Calvillo that
she wanted to tell her story to the American Embassy.
(Thid.) Calvillo dissuaded her by telling her that the
American Embassy was full of Communist spies. (Ibid.)
Elena said that some of the other people who had been at
the party were taken to Veracruz where they were "protected"
by Governor Lopez Arias. ZLibid; The House Select Committee
was unable to determine the veracity of Ms. Paz' allega-
tion./ She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly "protected"
by General Clark Flores, was very prosperous and was
driving a big car. (Era #586-587, Wx-7241, Entry No. 425,
p- 91, CIA No. 7187 Elena also claimed that Ruben Duran
told her months after the assassination that he was not
really a Communist and that killing Kennedy had been a
mistake. (Ibid; the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions has not been able to determine whether Ruben actually
spoke to Elena about the assassination. Ruben Duran claims
he had no reason to.7

Charles Thomas circulated a copy of the Charles Tho-
mas memorandum in the American Embassy including the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency's Mexico City Station.to aid
them in their investigation of the John F. Kennedy assassina-
tion. /The House Select Committee has determined that the

Central Intelligence Agency received the copy of the Thomas



een bic est

memorandum prior to December 25, 1965. See below.7 The
COS wrote a note on the memo: “What an imagina-
tion she has!?! Should we send to Headquarters?" The of-
ficer replied, "Suggest sending. There have been stories
around town about all this, and Thomas is not only person
she has talked to...If memory serves me, didn't LICOOKIE
refer to Oswald and the local leftists and Cubans in one
of her squibs?" (CIA No. 588, note from SW to cos.)

The Mexico City Station called the information in
Thomas' 12/10/65 memorandum of conversations to CIA Head-
quarters (Cable from Mexico City to the Director, Mexi 5621,
date out off my copy; CIA Nos. 584-585) The cable reported
that Elena's story would be checked with LICHANT/1, against
the production from ‘the Cuban surveillance operation "and
other sources." (Ibid.) Winston Scott wrote, next to the
routing indications on the cable, "Please ask Charles Tho-
mas if he'll ‘follow up.' Get questions from Anne G. (Anne
Goodpasture7 Please let's discuss. Thanks." (Ibid.)

After the December 10 memorandum of conversations,
Winston Scott (Chief/Station) and Nathan Ferris (Legal

Charles
Attache) called / Thomas for a meeting. They asked him
to get a more detailed replay of Ms. Garro's story. At
this meeting Winston Scott made it clear that the FBI
had full responsibility for any further investigation in

the Oswald case. (State Dept: letter from Charles Thomas


Saal pas

mately two months after the assassination two "Communists"
personally warned her never. to reveal that she had been
to a party with Oswald. (Ibid.) Deba, consequently,

would not accompany Elena to the American Embassy to tell
her story on November 24, 1964, (Ibid.)

Elena said that a few days after the assassination
Emilio Carballido took the Durans to Jalapa, Varacruz and
"kept them out of the way until the initial shock of the
assassination wore off." (Thid.) The House Select Committee
has been unable to confirm Ms. Garro's allegation."

Elena also alleged that shortly after the assassina-
tion an American named June Cobb spent several days in her
house. (Ibid.) She said that Ms. Cobb had been sent to
Elena by a mutual friend, Eunice Odio. (Ibid.) Elena
claims that while Ms. Cobb was at her house she expressed
an interest in the Kennedy assassination. (Ibid.) Deba,
visiting Elena one night, got drunk and told Ms. Cobb the
entire story. (Ibid.) Ms. Cobb wanted them to go to the
American authorities. (Tbid.) Claiming to be a cra agent,
Cobb suggested that Elena and Deba go to Texas to tell their
story. (Ibid.) When her suggestion was rejected, Cobb
said that she would arrange a meeting with the CIA Station
Chief. The meeting did not occur because Ms. Cobb Wasi
asked to leave the Garro house; evidently because she

kicked Elena's cat. (Tbid.) The House Select Committee on



Sor

Assassinations has determined that June Cobb Sharp was
a CIA asset in 1964. (Supra p. 3

Elena claimed that Ruben Duran visited her circa
the end of January 1964. (CIA Nos. 580-583; Wx 7241, Entry
#427, p. 92, CIA #719) He was worried that Oswald's visit
to his home might be discovered.and that he might lose
his Mexican citizenship. (Ibid.) Ruben told Elena that
it had been Silvia who had gotten him involved with Oswald.
(Ibid.) Ruben added that he was not really a Communist
and had opposed the assassination. (Ibid.) (Ruben Duran
denied the story. HSCA Interview of Ruben Duran, :
Pp. 1 JFK Doc. # )

Elena said that she had told her story to Noe Palomares
of the Gobernacion about six months after the assassina-
tion. (Ibid.) He advised against going to the American
Embassy and told her that if she did anything at all she
should merely write an anonymous letter. (Ibid.) The
Committee spoke to Mr. Palomares who denied Ms. Garro's
claim. (HSCA interview of Noe Palomares, JFK Doc. )

Elena stated that it was "common knowledge" that
Silvia had been Oswald's mistress. (CIA Nos. 580-583;
Wx7241, Entry #427, p. 92 CIA #719) When asked who could
verify the allegation she could only remember one person
who had told her this. (Ibid.) Elena claimed that person
was Victor Rico Galan, a "pro-Castro journalist." (Ibid.)

(Victor Rico Galan is dead. The Committee could not verify


~ 20 -

Ms. Garro's allegation. Sylvia Duran denied the allega-
tion. Nonetheless, LIRING 3, a CIA asset reported the
same story in 1967.7

During these conversations Elena also said that
she "understood" that Oswald had been in Mexico more than
once. (Ibid.)
The HSCA-has been unable to determine the exact date./

Subsequent to December 25, 1965,/Thomas wrote in
the December 25, 1965 memo that Elena had found her
calendar and had reconstructed the date of the party as
late September and not early September. /CIA Nos. 580-
583, Wx-7241, Entry #427, p. 42, cIa #7197 When Thomas
went to Ferris' office and informed him, Ferris replied
that Elena had given the late September date when she had
originally reported her story at the American Embassy.
(FBI Report, 9/30/69, pp.3-4, JFK Doc. No. ) However,
Mr. Ferris explained to Thomas that someone who had been
at the party had stated that there were no Americans there.
(Ibid.) Mr. Ferris did not tell Mr. Thomas that Ario
Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius Ferris had provided this in-
formation in 1964. (Supra p. ) Mr. Ferris suggested
that it was not necessary for Thomas to pursue the matter
since he considered the Oswald case closed and had heard
all the rumors before. ZFBI Report, 9/30/69, Pp. 3-4,
JFK Doc. No. 7

The State Department forwarded (the same day) a copy

of the Charles Thomas memorandum to the Central Intelligence

Agency's Mexico City Station to aid in their investiga-
tion of -the John F. Kennedy assassination. On the first
page of the memorandum of conversation Winston Scott wrote

December 27, 1965 Legal Attache Memo to the United States

Ambassador re Elena Garro

On December 27, 1965 the Legal Attache had written
a memo to the Ambassador reporting that Elena and her daugh-
ter were interviewed on 17 and 24 November 1964. / Memo
to the Ambassador from the Legal Attache, 12/27/65, CIA
#578; WX-7241, Entry #429, p. 94, CIA 4721.7 The memo
said that Elena and her daughter furnished information simi-
lar to that in Thomas' 12/10/65 memo. (Ibid.) The memo
further stated, "Inquiries conducted at that time. (Novem-
ber 1964), however, failed to substantiate the allegations
made by Mrs. Garro-de Paz and her daughter. In view of
the fact that Mrs. Garro de Paz! allegations have been pre-
viously checked out without substantiation, no further
action is being taken concerning her recent repetition of
those allegations." (Ibid.)

The Legal Attache forwarded a copy of the memorandum
to the Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico City Station.
(The House Select Committee has determined that the copy

was forwarded prior to 12/29/78. See*below.) Winston

Scott superimposed a note to Anne Goodpasture
on this memo which read, "Can we send in a report to
Headquarters ‘dismissing’ our cable?" Goodpasture re-
sponded, "Done." (Memo to the Ambassador from the Legal
Attache, 12/27/65, CIA #578, WX-7241 Entry #429, p. 94,
CIA #721) The cable Winston Scott wanted dismissed was
Mexi 5621 (Supra. p. )

on December 29, 1965

A cable written by Anne Goodpasture/reporting the
Legat interview with Elena and the Legat office's failure
to substantiate Elena's story was sent to Headquarters.
(Memo from Mexico City to the Director, 12/29/65, Mexi
5741, CIA #575; WX-7241 Entry #430, p. 94, CIA #721).

The cable promised to keep Headquarters advised if any
further information were to develop. (Ibid.)

LICOOKIE's 10/5/64 memo is attached to this cable.
WX-7241 explained this in a marginal comment, "This docu-
ment by LICOOKIE was not in (Oswald's file), but was copied
from (a project file) and attached to Mexi 5741, 29 Dec
65." (Ibid.)

A note superimposed to this cable by Allen White
stated, "I don't know what FBI did in November 1964, but
the Garros have been talking about this for a long time
‘and she is said to be extremely bright." Anne Goodpasture
wrote that the FBI had found Elena's allegations unsubstan-
tiated but that "we will try to confirm or refute Ms. Garro

de Paz's information and follow up." Win Scott wrote,



eee lc jer
"She is also 'nuts.'" (Ibid. CIA 4574)

CIA Investigation of Elena's Allegation that She Created

A_Disturbance at the Cuban Embassy on November 23, 1963

On February 3, 1966 Anne Goodpasture forwarded
Thomas' December 25, 1965 memo to the Cuban section with
an attached note asking them to check whether Elena was
"seen creating such a disturbance as they claimed in front
of the Cuban Embassy." (Note from Anne Goodpasture to
"Cubans," 2/3/66, CIA No. 579; WX-7241, Entry 428, p. 94,
CIA #721.)

One Cuban section officer responded, "No bells ring
with me." Another one wrote "Me neither." The third of-
ficer wrote, "No pictures either." (Ibid.) {There is no
indication that the penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy
were queried about Elena's allegation. Ibid., that there
are no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed that
the event happened: 1) ona Saturday at 3:00 p.m. when
the Cuban Embassy was not normally photographically sur-
veilled; and 2) the "disturbance" occurred inside the Cuban
compound. HSCA Examination of the CIA Cuban Embassy photo-
graphic surveillance showed no surveillance on 11/23/63.

Legal Attache 2/23/66 Memo to the United States Ambassador

Regarding Elena Garro's Allegations

On 2/23/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to the
Ambassador reporting that "extensive investigation"
failed to disclose that Oswald had traveled to Mexico
prior to September 26, 1963 ahd that no information had
developed that would show that he had not been in New Or-
leans in the early part of that month. /Memo from Legat
to Ambassador, 2/23/66, CIA #571; WX-7241 Entry #455, p. 95,
CIA #7227 =the memo reitereated that no further action
was being taken by the FBI because Elena's allegations had
not been substantiated. (Ibid.) The Legal Attache fowardea
a copy to the Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico City
Station. (The House Select Committee on Assassinations has
been unable to determine when the copy was forwarded to
the CIA.) A marginal comment made by Anne Goodpasture next
to this entry in wx-7241 says, "How can it be ascertained
that Oswald did not travel to Mexico prior to early September
1963? There must be some basis for Elena's reporting."

(Ibid; referenced to Thomas' 12/25/65 memo.)

Charles Thomas 7/13/66 Memorandum of Conversation re Elena

Garro
On 7/13/66 Charles Thomas wrote a ienor anata of con-

versation reporting that Elena had told him that she had

received an invitiation to visit Cuba from Ambassador

Juoquin Hernandez Armas. (Memorandum of Conversation by


tee

Charles Thomas, 7/13/66, CIA #565; .WX-7241, Entry 460,

P- 96, CIA #723) Elena gave Thomas two letters to sup-
port her claim. (Ibid.) She said the ltters had been
delivered to her home by a driver from the Cuban Embassy.
(Ibid.) The envelope gave her address as Vermont 38.
(Ibid.) Because of her stay at the Hotel Vermont she saw
the letters as a threat and was frightened. (Ibid. ) (The
HSCA has determined that the Cuban Government invited
Elena Garro to visit Cuba due to her literary talents;

See Biography.)

Legal Attache Memo to Winston Scott re Elena's Allegation

that She Had Stayed at the Hotel vermont from the Day After

the Assassination until November 30, 1963

On 10/13/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to the
CIA/COS reporting that a reliable confidential informant
had reported that the records of the Hotel Vermont dis-
closed that "Elena Paz, housewife from San Luis Potosi"
had registered at the Hotel Vermont on November 23, 1963.
She left on November 30, 1963. (Memo from Legat to Winston
Scott, 10/13/66, CIA No. 564; WX-7241, Entry #466, p. 98,
CIA #725; Thomas' 7/13/66 memo.) (The House Select Committee
on Assassinations has been unable to determine why the
Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigations waited until 1966 to investigate this aspect
of Elena's story.) The Memo said that "the above individual

may or may not be identical with Elena Garro de Paz." (Ibid.)


iD Ge

Charles Thomas' 12/25/65 memo states, "She (Elena)

and her daughter dia not personally register at the hotel.

She thinks Calvillo registered them as relatives or friends
of his from San Luis Postosi." (Memo of Conversation by
Charles Thomas, 12/25/65, P- 3, CIA #582) The entry for
the 10/13/66 Legat memo in Wx-7241 bore the notation,

“This is what Elena claimed and no one would believe her."

(WX-7241, Entry #466, p. 98, CIA #725

Charles Thomas' September 30, 1969 Letter to State Depart-

ment_and Legal Attaches Response

No further report on Elena's story was generated
until 1969 when Charles Thomas was "selected out." ("Se-
lected out" is a phrase used when an officer is retired
after having been in one grade for the maximum period of
time and is not considered qualified for promotion to a
higher grade). Then, he wrote a memorandum to the Secre-
tary of State which included a cover letter stating,
"Since I was the Embassy Officer in Mexico who acquired
this intelligence information, I feel a responsibility
for seeing it through to its final evaluation." (State
Department: Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers,
Secretary of State, July 25, 1969)

Charles Thomas' memorandum stated that "he got no

reaction from Nathan Ferris and Winston Scott" regarding


~27-

his memorandum of December 25, 1965. (State Doosan
Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary
of State, July 25, 1969) In addition, Thomas wrote that
the only person to speak to him about the December 25,
1965 memorandum, Clarence Bomstra (Deputy Chief of Mis-
sion, State Department, Chief of Affairs at the time of
President Kennedy's assassination and subsequent Oswald
investigation) told him that Oswald had not been in Mexico
on the date given for the Bates Department: Letter
from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary of State,
July 25, 1964) Thomas noted that even when he reiterated
that Elena had not changed her story but rather that she
had now given a more accurate account, Boonstra stated that
the date was wrong and dismissed the entire affair. (Ibid.)
pate City Legat officers, Nathan Ferris, in
reply to Thomas' letter and memorandum, asserted that
Thomas' office had been advised by memoranda dated Decem-
ber 27, 1965 and February 23, 1966 that since Elena Garro's
allegations had previously been investigated without sub-
stantiation, no further action was being taken concerning
her recent repetition of those allegations. (FBI Report,
9/30/69, pp. 3-4, JFK Doc. No. ) In their report, the
Legat's Office concluded that either the Counselor for Poli-
tical Affairs did not route the memoranda to Charles Thomas

or that Thomas did not recall receiving them. (Ibid.)

Thomas wrote that when he went to Nathan Ferris'
office to inform him that Elena had found her calendar
and had reconstructed the date of the Party as late Sep-
tember, Ferris replied that Elena had given the late Sep-
tember date when she had originally reported her story at
the American Embassy. (State Department: Letter from Charles
Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary of State, Julye 25,
1969). Thomas noted that Ferris explained that someone
wh chad been at the party had stated that there had not
been any Americans, (Ibid.) He wrote that he had assumed
that Elena could have clearly been mistaken about the identi-
ty of the American she saw there, but never doubted that
she had seen some Americans. (Ibid.) Thomas alleged that
Ferris suggested that it was not necessary for Thomas to

: pursue the matter since he considered the Oswald case

closed and had heard all the rumors before. (Ibid.)

The Legat Office replied that Mr. Ferris had not
told Thomas that someone who was at the Party had stated
that there had not been any Americans present. (FBI Report,
9/39/69, p. 4, JFK Doc. No. ) The report asserted that
Thomas had been told that it would not be necessary for
him to pursue the m ater any further since Elena's story
had been investigated previously without being substantiated.
(Ibid.) In addition, the memo stated that Thomas had been

told that Elena's story was considered a closed issue, not

that the Oswald case was closed. (Ibid.)

House Select Committee on Assassinations' Investigation of

Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investi-
gated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews and
personal interviews. ‘The Committee requested and reviewed
the CIA's, FBI's and State Department's files, when
available, on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz,
Manuel Calvillo, Noe Ww. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia

Duran, Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio
Azcue, and Emilio Carballido. Only the Elena Garro de

Paz file contained information on her allegations. Though
all the names listed above played a role in Elena Garro

de Paz' story, not one of their files included a reference
to Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-—
tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence
Agency's LICOOKIE I, LICHANT I, LIRING 3, LIHUFF I and
TICHBORN files. Once again, not one of the files included
a mention of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select
Committee on Assassinations learned that LICOOKIE I was
June Cobb Sharp who first reported Elena's allegation.

(Supra, p. 4) The Committee also learned that LICHANT I

hidden
who had/Elena Garro and her daughter

in a hotel the day following the assassination. (Supra,

P- 13) He also tola Elena that Sylvia Duran had been ar-

rested before this fact had become public knowledge. (Ibid.)

Since a file review was inconclusive, the Committee
decided to arrange interviews in Mexico with Sylvia Duran,
Elena Garro, Elenita Garro, Horacio Duran, Ruben Duran,
Lynn Duran, Emilio Carbillido and Betty Serratos. The
Mexican Government informed the House Select Committee on
Assassinations that Elena and Elenita Garro disappeared
in 1968 during the student uprisings and have never re-
turned to Mexico. The officials stated that Elena and
her daughter might be in Spain. (See Mexico City Proce-
dural Write-up Trip 1.) The Mexican government reported
that Emilio Garballido could not be found. (Ibid.) The
others were interviewed between June 1 and June 6, 1978.
(Ibid.)

Betty Serratos, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran, and Horatio
Duran all stated that Elena was not the dancing type and
therefore did not attend any of the twist parties at the
Duran homes. (See: HSCA Interview of Betty Serratos,
6/6/78, p. 6, JFK Document No. ; HSCA Staff Interview of
Lydia Duran, 6/5/78, p. 6, JFK Document No. > HSCA
Staff Interview of Ruben Duran Navarro, 6/6/78, p. 16, JFK
Document No. ; HSCA Staff Interview of Horatio Duran

Navarro, 6/5/78, P- 25, JFK Document No. ). When


\ - 31 -

Sylvia Duran was asked if Elena or Elenita Garro ever
attended twist parties at the Duran homes, she recalled
Elena attending one twist party at Ruben's home in 1963
when the Garros returned to Mexico from France. (HSCA
Staff Interview of Sylvia Tirado Bazan, 6/6/70, p. 90,
JFK, Document No. ) All the Durans denied that Lee
Harvey Oswald had attended any party at one of their
homes. (String cites.)

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence
Agency to arrange staff interviews with LICHANT/1 (Manuel
Calvillo), LICOOKIE/1 (June Cobb) ; along with a list of
other assets who may have had information related to Lee
Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (

The Central Intelligence Agency declined to aid the Com-
mittee in this aspect of the investigation.

The Committee eer ied to Mexico City and attempted
to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel Calvillo. (See Proce-
dural Write-up Trip 2 Mexico City) The results of the Com-
mittee's work were as follows: 1) The Mexican government
told the Committee that June Cobb Sharp received a tourist
permit, number 72781, on June 27, 1947 when she entered
Mexico through Nuevo Laredo. She asked, but was deniied,
permission to represent the magazine, Modern Mexico. On
June 21, 1948, she received a courtesy permit, number 25556.

Furthermore, the Mexican government explained that she dis-



- 32 -

appeared in 1954 and never returned to Mexico. (See Pro-
cedural Writeup Trip 2 Mexico City.) The Committee believes
that there is a possibility that this information is incor-
rect. According to Ms. Cobb's CIA file she worked for the
agency as an asset in Mexico from 1961 through 1966. (CIA
Report, 1965, June Cobb file, 201- ) Elena also
stated that Ms. Cobb resided at her home in 1964. (Supra

Pp. ) 2) The Mexican government told the Committee
that Manuel Calvillo did not live at Cuohtemoc 877-5 as

the Committee had stated. Their agent-in-charge had spoken
to the superintendant at the apartments for the past
twenty-five years who said that no Manuel Calvillo had

ever resided there. When Committee staffers gave the Mexi-
can government Calvillo's pen name, the Mexicans gave the
same answers. (See Procedural Write Mexico City Trip 2.)
The Committee is quite certain that Mr. Calvillo lives at
this address since it acquired the address from a recent
CIA document. (CIA Report, 1976, Manuel Calvillo file,
201- )

The Committee believes that there is a possibility
that the Mexican government received orders from the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency to refrain from aiding the Committee
with this aspect of its work. (See Procedural Write-up

Trip 2 Mexico City.)

The Committee made every attempt possible to locate Elena.
On July 7, 1978 a Committee staffer telephoned
her publisher Mortiz in Mexico City and asked about her
whereabouts. (HSCA Staff Contact Report, 7/7/78, JFK
Document No. 10016) The publisher stated that Ms. Garro
was living in the Hotel S.A.C.E. in Madrid, Spain. (Ibid.)
The Committee staffer telephoned the Hotel in Spain and
spoke to the manager who told him that Ms. Garro had moved
out. (Ibid.) (ASCA Staff Contact Report, 7/7/78, JFK Do-
cument No. ) On July 14, 1978 a Committee staffer
called her publisher again and was told to contact the
Mexican Embassy in Madrid, Spain The publisher stated

that all Elena's chee ‘S Were Sent there because she did

( not even trust her publisher with her address. (Ibid.)

Nc uisca Staff Contact Report, 7/14/78, JFK Document No.

The Committee staffer called the Mexican Embassy in

Madrid, Spain and spoke to Adolfo Padilla, an employee
who stated that when Elena visited the Embassy a couple
of weeks before to pick up a check she looked financially
poor. (HSCA Staff Contact Report, 8/31/78, JFK Document
No. ) He stated that when he asked Elena her new ad-
dress she declined to give one, stating that she would
return every few weeks to pick up checks and mail. (Tbid.)

The staffer left the Committee's number and a message

asking Elena to telephone the Committee collect. (Ibid.)

On September 5, 1978, Elena Garro called the
Committee staffer. When the staffer explained that the

Committee wished to talk to her in person and would pay

both her daughter's and her travel from Spain, Ms. Garro
asked why she should believe the staffer was who he
Claimed. (HSCA Staff Contact Report, 9/5/78, JEK Document
No. ) The staffer asked Ms. Garro to call back
collect inthe next few days when he could explain to her
when and where she could receive a Committee letter deli-
neating why the Committee wished to interview her. (Ibid.)
The Committee wrote the letter and made arrangements with
the State Department for a letter to be hand-delivered

to Elena at the American Embassy in Spain. (See attached
4 letter: also, HSCA Staff Contact Report, 9/5/78, JFK Docu-
ment No. )

On September 7, 1978, Elena Garro called the Committee
staffer and asked when the letter would arrive. (HSCA Staff
Contact Report, 9/7/78, JFK Document No. ) The Com-
mittee staffer explained that the letter could be gotten
on Monday, September 11, 1978 from George Phelan, the
Counsellor for Consular Affairs at the American Embassy.
(Ibid.) Ms. Garro stated that she would get the letter
on September 11, 1978 and follow our suggestions. (Ibid.)

Ms. Garro never went to the American Embassy in

Spain to get the Committee's letter, (HSCA Staff Contact

Report, 9/15/78, JFK Document No. ) The Committee,
hoping she would receive the. letter before her flight
date, proceeded to purchase tickets for both Elena and
her daughter. (HSCA Staff Contact Report, 9/12/78, JFK
Document No. ) Elena never got the tickets at
the airport. (HSCA Staff Contact Report, 9/15/78, JFK
Document No. ) The Committee never regained con-
tact with her.

The Committee also investigated whether Thomas!
"selection out" was related to the Oswald case. After
interviewing his widow, Ms. Cynthia Thomas, the Committee
has concluded that his dismissal was unrelated. (HSCA
