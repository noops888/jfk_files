diminish rather than increase in the advanced stages of the operation,

An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between

This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14

This in turn gives rise to the question whether AMICE/14, with a

STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH.

The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27;

AMICE/14, AMTRUNK/2,

•and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safesite #164

on Plantation Key.

Andrew S. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from

headquarters, was already at the training site when the team

was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS

and Hobart J. VANDEBORN.

PARMERS remained at the safesite

until 16 March during which time he conducted training in

clandestine methods and techniques.. This

training included

security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-

tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,

and operational planning

and reporting.

The training included

group discussion and participation in a series of appropriate

operational situations, several problems, and daily physical

training.

During this two week period, either PEGGINS or

VANDEBORN visited the safesite every day, spending an average

of two or three hours with the group in operational dis-

cussions and processing.

During the week of 18 thru 23 March,

both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,

debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin

out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing

their training on an informal basis.

The week of 25 through

30 March was

spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

and map reading,

including two night problems, and on weapons

familiarization

and firing.

During the period under dis

cussion the AMIRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED, were assessed

the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series

of immunizations, were issued clothing, were processed for

alias documentation, were processed for disguises, and were

further processed on cover and finance problems.

The ré-

sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were

sent to headquarters

under cover of UFGA-8111, on 13 March 1963.

Based on DIR

26430, no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time.

the operation has been split into two initial phases, which

and continued to engage in underground activities.

Finally

when the situation

became hopeless he left Cuba by air for

Miami in (AuguSt 1962.

While A/3 has performed

satisfactorily

in his training up to date, his performance falls far short

of the other three members.

Fortunately his

role in this operation is comparatively minor and he appears

willing to comply with whatever A/2 decides.

Nevertheless,

direct control of A/3 offers problems in the future.

TASKS

Through contacts of A/3 obtain transportation for A/2

to Guanaba or Havana.

Although not definite, A/3 may remain at his!

train assets in maritime reception and clandestine

communications.

Having completed this he would then be ex-

filtrated at Punta Jijira.

4.

A/2 will go to Havana and obtain safehouse and operational

support through his contacts.

A/2 will contact and develop two potential assets with

high level connections within the Rebel Army.

6. A/2 will train support and operational assets in clandes-

INFIL-EXFIL PLANS

The tentative date for the infiltration of A/2 and 3 at

Punta La Jijira is 18 May 1963.

The infiltrees will make

their way to

one kilometer from

and from there A/2 will be provided with transportation to go

to Guanabo or Havana.

The exfiltration of A/3 will occur three days after his

infiltration,

This arrangment, as yet, is not definite.

3.

The exfiltration of A/2 is tentatively planned for 31

May 1963 at

Punta La Jijira

or Puerto Escondido.

A/3 feels

that Puerto Escondido would afford

a more secure point for

exfiltration but that a reconnaisance of the area would be

necessary before final decision is reached.

Prearranged

telegram

signal would indicate his preference.

The above

dates fall within a favorable moon phase

for

maritime operations.

In addition the infil-exfil schedule

will allow for an extra margin beyond the 10 days which A/2

considers the minimum acceptable period of time to make his

contacts.:
