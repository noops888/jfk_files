was opened pertaining to FINLEY. This file indicates that
FINLEY uses no "scratch" information but bases his odds
on the racing form and pays a limit of $32 to win, $14 to
show and $8 to place on a $2 bet. These odds;are very high,
as of Janwary 30, 1963, but were brought. about. by
competitors in that betting was very slow since Federal
Legislation had been enacted. . There was no indication of
a Federal violation on the part of FINLEY, who operated as
a bookie during the racing meet at Oaklawn Track, Hot
Springs, Arkansas,

On May .7, 1963, FINLEY advised an informant he
