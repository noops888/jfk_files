NO 165-178

Elmdale, Chicago, Illinois, who was identified as the wife

Of HAROLD HADESMAN, FBI #1691158, a jewel

thief

and

INFORMANT

burglar.

T-32 is ESTELLE KASS,

PCI of the Miami Office.

ADMINISTRATIVE

A careful review of the investigation conducted in

this case has failed to develop positive information that

subject, SAM DI PIAZZA, was the individual that was making

long distance telephone calls from the Fontainebleau

Motel for gambling purposes.

It is noted/that during the

time

these calls were

made from the Fontainebleau Motel

this motel was

. frequented by GILBERT LEE BECKLEY and his

nine associates who were on trial in the U. S. District Court,

Eastern District of Louisiana, on an Internal Revenue

violation..

It is noted that it has been possible to establish

the

identity and lo√ßation of a number of individuals who

have been or are suspected of being a gambling figure in

their respective communities.

The

various offices who have

conducted investigation have

been able

to open investigation

on these individuals or use the information in their.

investigation.

In view of the fact

establish that DI PIAZZA was the individual making these

calls, this case is being closed and the material developed

will be used for future intelligence purposes.

For information, HERMAN CARLISLE is a PCI in the

Birmingham Office and is carried under BH 282-PC.

CARLISLE has been fairly cooperative in furnishing

information to the Birmingham Office concerning gambling

activities, but he appears reluctant at times to discuss

certain individuals.

Investigation has been conducted concerning JAMES

VERDO KILGORE, by the Birmingham Office during the year, 1963,

under the character of ITWI, but this case is currently closed.

Investigation failed to reflect that KILGORE has made any toll

calls outside the State of Alabama.

gambling game

but

used house money to entice other players

or suckers to bet

The same report reflects that LAFFERTY said he

went to St. Louis with FINLEY on April 15, 1958 and

stayed

there until April 18,

1958, which was the

date of the robbery

of FERGUSON.

The Arkansas Gazette, a Little Rock newspaper dated

July 12, 1957, contained a list of wagering stamps issued

in Arkansas.

This list included FINLEY.

In

Little Rock file 162-1, Serial 1, entitled

"CYRUS JULIAN

LUTLE, aka, IGA - WIRE SERVICE"

3, 1961, informant advlena the Nola Printing Company April

operated by JOSEPH ALBERT PORETTO, New Orleans, Louisiana,

was the source of wire service to the Little Rock area:

The service was supposedly furnished by long distance telephone

to BARNEY BARNETT at Little Rock, who then relayed same

to local bookies, one of which was believed to be FINLEY.

The same file reflects that LAFFERTY stated LYTLE

furnished this service to FINLEY.

A list of Federal wagering stamps issued in

Little Rock District for fiscal year ending July 30, 1962

included FINLEY.

On January 26, 1962, a PCI file was opened

pertaining to FINLEY, since

he was no longer operating as a

bookmaker and not in

contact with former associates.

A description of FINLEY contained in this file

is as follows:

Little Rock file 92-124, pertaining to Top

Hoodlum Program, relfects that on August 15, 1958, file

was opened pertaining to FINLEY. This file indicates that

FINLEY uSeS no

"scratch" information but bases his odds

on the racing form and pays a limit of

$32 to. win, $14 to

show and $8 to place on a $2 bet. These odds are very high,

as of January 30,

1963, but were brought about by

competitors in that betting was very slow since Federal

Legislation had been enacted.. There was no indication of

a Federal violation on the part of FINLEY, who operated as

a bookie during the racing meet at Oaklawn Track, Hot

Springs, Arkansas.

On May 7, 1963, FINLEY advised an informant he

was ceasing his bookmaking operations and did not plan

to secure anymore racing forms.

On August 23, 1963, informant advised that

within the last few days, Little Rock bookmaker BOB BRYANT

had stated that FINLEY had currently engaged in the bookmaking

business in the area of

the Pulaski-Saline County line on

U. S. Highway 67, southwest of Little Rock, Arkansas, and

specifically operated at the Red Gate Liquor Store, Lola's

Restaurant, and at an unknown place in Benton, Arkansas.

RAYMOND KYZER advised informant that FINLEY'S

bookkeeper, NELL, and longtime girlfriend, had recently

left FINLEY and was married to some wino.

KYZER commented

to informant that FINLEY had almost lost his mind as a result

of NELL's marriage.
