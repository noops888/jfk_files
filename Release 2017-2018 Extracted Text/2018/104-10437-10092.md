According to a ‘Vashington Star clipping dated 2 March 1967,
Clay L. SHAW, who was arrested, indicted and is awaiting trial in
connection with the charge that he conspired with 1 ce Harvey OS.\7ALD
and David ‘/. FERRI£ to assassinate { resident KENNEDY, was coscribed
by one Jesse CORE as a political liberal who was ‘very zdmiring’ of
President KENNEDY. According to CORN, SHAW ‘talked of voting for
KENNEDY in 1960” end wore a KENNEDY for President button. Jesse
CORE worked with SHAW in 1963 at the International Trade Mart in
New Orleans.

Security indices reflect that onr Jesse R. CORE, Chief Consul
with USIS in the American Enibagsy in Madras, India, in 1950, was a
friend of David Gilmore BALD WIN, (#49842

ing a

erious security, breach which involved a Mrs. Lillian BAXTER of
Calcutta, India who also was known to CORE. Mrs. BAXTER who was
believed to be an American with Indian citizenship, had formerly been
married to an Anglo-Indian planter in India and was said to have become
a prostitute and in 1951 to have been kept by a wealthy Marwari. She
was believed to be controlled by Indian Intelligence and it was thought
that she might be an agent for any of several governments including
England and Russia. She won an associate of David Gilmore BALDWIN
and was suspected of stealing security documenta from him.

There is insufficient information segarding Jesse CORE, Clay
SHA V's associate, to positively identify him us BALD 'VIN's friend,
Jesse R. CORE. but it seems quite probable that they are the same.
BALDWIN ia from Mew Orleans and it would appear that his friend CORE
is alsa, in as much as he seems in all probability to be the husband of
a Mrs. Jess CORE. nee: Lucy &ugsles, who as of 1956 was said to be
married to a man in the State Department and to be somewhere overseas,
and as of 1957 was said to reside in New Orleans, louisiana. This

Volunteera for RAINEY, which was of interest to the Security Office

in 1956-1957 because of the fact that current CIA employee, Michael

which numbered about 25 persona most of whom. were said to have been
forrer students of the University of Tyas from which Homer T. RAINEY,
a former liberal’ president, had becr discharged waa of a Mberal/
radical persuasion. Gne member of the group (in which Mro. Jesse CORE,
then Lucy RUGGLES. the daughter of ‘i/illiam RUGGLES, an editorial
