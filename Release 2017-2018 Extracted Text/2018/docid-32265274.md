This woman, Bowley stated, was standing across the street

from the man lying in the street.

Bowley pulled his car to the right side of the roadway,.

about 100 yards from where the man was lying and got out on

the driver's side and went to the man on the ground. The man

his

was lying on/right side with his face down. When Bowley

reached him he rolled him over on his back. He could see

that he was dead. He found no signs of life. Bowley stated

that he saw no blood and did not know that the man had been

shot at the time.

Recognizing the man as being a police officer

Bowley stated he found the officers revolver on the ground

under him. The weapon was out of it's holster and near the

officers right hand. Bowley picked the weapon up and placed

it on the front seat of the scout car. The radio of the scout

car was on and the Mexican man was attempting to use it to

call for help. Bowley informed the man that he was familiar

with two-way radio's and if he'd let him, he could get the

call for help through. Using the police radio in the scout

car, Bowley notified the police dispatcher that an officer

had been shot and

gave his location. After acknowledging the

call the police dispatcher asked "will the citizen please

clear

the air." at that time he put the microphöne down. Bowley

remained on the scene until the police arrived. white awaiting

the arrival of the police Bowley began to ask what had happened.

He was told by someone on the scene that a man shot the officer

and had ran West on l0th Street toward the Church. When

the police arrived on the scene Bowley gave a uniformed

officer his name and where he could be reached, and informed

him that he was leaving town and going on a vacation. The

officer told Bowley to contact police when he returned.

Bowley left the area driving West on Tenth Street and turned

right to 9th and Zang, where he picked up his wife and went

home. When Bowley returned from his vacation in San Antonia,

(he did not remember the date) he contacted the police and

later went to police headquarters and

gave a statement

to

detective.

During this interview Bowley stated that he knew Jack ruby

and had been

associated with him since the 1950's. He had

worked for Ruby at Ruby's after hour club, "the Silver Spur,"

Bowley advised that he first met Ruby when a club he was

running, the Hernando's Hide-away, ran into financial problems.

Ruby stepped in and took over the club. This club was on

Greenville Avenue in Dallas.

This

was in 1951 or 1952. After this Bowley went to work

for Ruby. At one time he collected the cover money on the

door at Ruby's after hour club "the Silver Spur." Bowley

worked for Ruby off and on until about 1957 or 1958.
