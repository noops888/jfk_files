SUBJECT : Washington Star Story, 1 October 1574

1, This is for your information only.

2, Onl October 1976 the Washington Star published a news
story with an Associated Press crecit line, headlined CLA

lead stated:

Contrary to sworn testimozy, the CIA once con-
sidered using presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald as a source of intelligence information
about the Sovict Union, according {oa newly .
released CIA document,

In sworn testimony before the Warren Commission,
former CIA Director Richard Helms said the
Agency never had "or even coatemplated" any
contacts with Oswald.

‘The news story, in another section, made the following.
statement:

As soon as I had heard Oswald's name, U recalled
that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed --
sometime in the summer of 1940 -- with
Chief and Deputy Caief of tne $ Rese:

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the
USSR had struck me from the moment I had rend

subordinates something amcunting to “Don!: push
too hard to get the informaticn we need, because
this individual look: odd."

after...

The Helms testimony before the Warren Commission

on this subject was as follows:

,

Mr. Helms. On Mr, McCone's behalf, I had all

our records searched to see if there had been

any contacts at any time prior to President Kennedy's
assassination by anyone in the Central Intelligence
Agency with Lee Harvey Oswald. We checked our
card files and our personal files and all our records,

Now this check turned out to be negative. In addition
I got in touch with those officers who were in’ positions
of responsibility at the times in question to see if
anybody had any recollection of any contact having
even been suggested with this man, This also turned
out to be negative, so there is nd material in the
Central Intelligence Agency, either in the records or
in the mind of any of the individuals, that there was
any contact had or even contemplated with kim.

interest in Oswald,



5. Mr. Helms did state exactly the words quoted in the
news story -- “or even contemplated." But the context of
those words was what was reported to him as the result of
a search of records and memories. To this day those
familiar with the extensive Gswald records state that there
is no reflection in those records that anyone even underto:
to propose or approve a contact with Oswald, It would have
been natural to do so, but apparently any such thoughts did
not progress to formal action, From the memorandum
quoted, it is apparent that someone at Branch level ‘id thine
about it, even if uothing ever came of it, This hardly con-
stitutes a responsible or official or serious "contemplation"
of the idea. Mr. Helms! full statement on this poiat seems
literally correct in the full context of his statement, although
more refined qualifications might have reiterated tie basis
for his conclusions. The news story is misleading on this
point.

6 The news story statement that Oswald was considered
due to his "unusual behavior in the USSR," is exactly the
opposite of the statements of the quoted memorandum, which
reported the care that should be used if Cswald ware approached,
because of his strange conduct.

7. The statement in the news story about Mr. Dulles
consulting with Agency personnel on how to answer questions
is basically true. The interpretation to be placed on this
counseiling will depend on the interpreter, The infercace of
the news story is that Mr. Dulles was counselling slanted
responses on the Oswald issue, thereby tending to reinforce
the interpretation of deception attributed to Mr. Helms.
