Dear Leo:

I appreciate very much your ccnsjderation in sending me a copy
of the Donovan Commission report on the Communist redefection
campaign, The subject is a most important one, worthy of the must
careful study, and Iam sure that the’efforts of the International
Rescue Committee will add up to vital contribution toward a solution:
of some of the problems aurroundisg it.

As you are aware, a number of agencies, both private and
governmental, are actively working towa.d an improvement in the
circumstances in which many eécapees iind themeeives, As remedial
action is aggressively taken, the difficulties the Communists exploit
will be removed.

Ihave read the report/persorally, and, at your convenience,
will welcome farther discussion of any matters you feel are pertinent
but were not covered in the report itself.

Sincerely,
Allen W. Dulles
Director
