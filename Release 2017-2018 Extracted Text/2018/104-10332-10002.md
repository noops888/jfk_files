MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Historical Review Group a
Chief, Information Management Service
Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM: John Berg
. Special Assistant to the Associate Deputy
Director for Operations
SUBJECT: Release of JFK Assassination Records iad
REFERENCE: A. Memorandum from DDO dated 9 June 1993:
F Subject: Release of JFK Assassination ~
Records -- Differences;

B. Memorandum by Dave Gries of 22 June 1993:
Subject: JFK Assassination Records-- Proposal
for discussion

1. Regarding the items discussed in the referenced memos,
it appears that a further interpretation is required.

~-On the subject of cryptonyms, we cannot give wholesale
approval for their release, but if the crypts have been
previously blown or exposed they can be released. There may be
cases in which, if the crypt has been retired, does not relate
to existing or another project and does not contain a valid
digraph, it may also be released. Note, however, that crypts
which are related to a series (ZZBOAT/1, ZZBOAT/2 etc.), would,
when exposed, link operations or assets to one another or which
refer tb other operations or projects cannot be released. ~

--Qn. the subject of pseudonyms, if the pseudonym has been
previously blown, there is no objection to its release. Note
that release of pseudonyms serves to link officers with
assets/operations and this “guilt by association” could lead to
futher, undesireable, exposures. Care must also be taken so
that the release of pseudonyms is not done in such a manner so
as to enable a researcher to accummulate through an inspection
of numerous documents the approximate size of a given station.
(The sense of this is to mean that only a small number of
pseudonyms would be considered for release.)


SECRET

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Assassination Records

==On the subject of cable, dispatch and file numbers,~there
is no objection to the release of this information as it
pertains to Mexico City, to include 201 numbers of key players
in the JFK story. All hqs cable numbers can be released as can
dispatch numbers to Mexico City. The release of cable/dispatch
numbers from other Stations can only be done if there has been
prior public identification of a Station in that location. The
release of file numbers pe se, however, would reveal the
methodology by which we file/store and retrieve information--
which is still in practice today and thus we cannot approve it
on a blanket basis. Blanket release of 201 numbers reveals
similar information as well as targeting/acquistion
methodologies which we similarly need to continue to protect.

2. I realize that the above guidelines continue to mean
that much information will be “blacked out." As bad as it may
appear, none of this information is substantive and its
omission does not detract from the “story.” ‘Its release,
however, could permit detailed analyses of our commo,
methodology, contacts and staffing which we cannot accept.

New Subject: Release of William Pawley's name

3. It is agreed that an attempt will be made to locate
Pawley's next of kin to request their permission to release
information pertaining to his relationship with CIA. If the
next of kin cannot be indentified or located, the subject can
be revisited. (Note: the information in the Congressional
record or in the book “Deadly Secrets" notes that there was
contact and even support between Pawley and the CIA but does
not identify the full extent of that relationship.) 7

Memo for File

Subject: ARRB request re “slug line” deletions

The policy of deleting ALL crypts & designators in the slug
line was questioned by ARRB members at the 18 May meeting
with CIA. The DO representatives present & McNair)
deferred to the Office of Communications.

Per 6 June 1995 discussion Crs’ Saisie | DA/IRO, “the slug
line is strictly an internal distribution line”, and the
release of crypts or other designators in the slug line is
not a communications issue; slug crypts are not “commo
generated”. The DA has no objection to the release of
otherwise releasable crypts in the slug line of CIA cables.

The DA response was provide to-J. Gunn, ARRB staff, and Bill
McNair, DO/IRO, via phone on 6 June 1995.

Dear John:

As you know from our meeting with you on May 18, 1995, as well as from previous
meetings with ARRB staff members, CIA’s current practice of redacting the sluglines
from its cables in the JFK Assassination Collection is of interest to the Assassination
Records Review Board. As a result of discussion on this topic at the May 18 meeting,
the Board in fact asked those present from CLA to provide it with any additional
information available in support of this practice.

If you have any further information in support of redacting otherwise releasable
cryptonyms when present in cable sluglines, we would appreciate receiving it by this
afternoon, so we can present it to the Board at its meeting tomorrow morning.

With many thanks for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely yours,

Si 1

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Historical Review Group

FROM: Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.
DO, Focal Point for ARRB
SUBJECT: Position on Release of Cryptonyms, Country

consi

Designators, Action Indicators and Employee True
Names"

During the period since the ARRB last met, the DO has
dered the four issues listed below that have not yet been

addressed with the Board. These issues appear throughout the JFK
collection and by stating our position up front we hope to

facil

itate the Board’s review and to reach an agreement that will

be mutually satisfying to the Board and the Agency.

Cryptonyms — Except for cryptonyms related to - :
operational assets or activities involving Mexico or Miami,
the Agency will release the main component of cryptonyms and
withhold only the two-letter digraph.. Treating cryptonyms
in this manner will. protect the nationalities of individuals
and operations that are not pertinent to Oswald or the JFK
investigation and encer an easiér reading of the written ~
material.

Country File Designators - We will delete the first
element of operational activity and operational interest
files in those instances when the credibility of’ the.
narrative is not affected. The first element of the file
number corresponds to the alphabetical position of the
country name which’ is easily discernible, whereas the
subsequent two elements relate to type of activity or
interest and specific subject.

Action Indicator (Slug) Lines - Generally, we will
release the entire-action indicator line of a document.
Occasionally, however, we will withhold portions when the

DRV HUM 4-82 -*

context identifies a source or a relationship with a

frue Names of Staff Employees - In most instances we

will release names of employees who have retired in an overt
status and were serving in Headquarters when cited in a
document. We will continue to protect the true names of
employees cited as serving in a field position. References
to field personnel in true name are uncommon, however, since
pseudonyms are normally used in correspondence between
Headquarters and the field.

-e Any unilateral violation of a clandestine trust has a
devastating, compounding consequence for an intelligence

will acknowledge their own clandestine relationship at

e Their fear could be sufficient to force them to take
self-protective measures (e.g., disengagement by current

e Additionally, such violations of a clandestine trust most
assuredly impact upon the willingness of potential future

25 September 1998

MEMORANDUM FOR: Bob Skwirot

FROM: Charles A. Briggs-Y- a :
\ : :

OFFICE: DCI/CSI/HRG

SUBJECT: Mexico City Station History

REFERENCE:

The Mexico City Station History contains at least 99 separate cryptonyms, for the most part
concerning projects, but in some cases, individuals, covering the period(i947 to June 1969. In
every case, there is identifying information included with the crypt, ranging from a brief
parenthetical phrase to several pages of detail. Since the information far exceeds that thought
relevant to the JFK story, both in time and substance, an approach designed to provide a maximum
amount of information and guidance for historians concerned with the JFK assassination, with a
minimum of gratuitously useable leads for curious or hostile FOIA requestors concerning CIA
activities generally, was chosen and is reflected in the version the Board has for consideration.

The norm in handling cryptonyms when the entire crypt is not released is to protect the
digraph - the location indicator. What I've done here, to avoid unraveling, in effect, the whole
history of Station activity for subsequent curiousity seekers, is to reverse the process, releasing the
digraph and protecting the root - specifically because the text identifies each crypt. The Board is
familiar with the decision to release almost all LI-crypts in full - while protecting identifying
information. The major relevant LI projects (LIENVOY, LITEMPO, LICALLA, etc.) have had both the
full cryptonym and most of the details released. iN et
Station_and-Operation Directorate division histories are among the most sensitive documents

in the Agency. They are very tightly controlled within. the area divisions - they are not available to
cleared employees in other directorates or, traditionally, outside of the division within the Operations
Directorate. Thus concern about the release of the Mexico City History pages that, viewed through
| the widest of lenses, do not appear to be relevant to the JFK story,is very great.
