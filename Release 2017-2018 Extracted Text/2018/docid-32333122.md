Bankers! Exchange in Pittsburgh, whereby he can obtain information

regarding bank loans made to Pittsburgh top hoodlums.

is also familiar with the activities of several of Pittsburgh's

top hoodlums, particularly, those of LA ROCCA,

"from" having

worked

on criminal matters

for many years in the city of

Pittsburgh.

In an effort to increase criminal informant coverage, efforts

will be made to persuade

to again work as a

waitress in the Red Eagle Club, formerly known as

the Genovese

Cocktail Lounge, as soon as it

becomes apparent that racket

operations are again under way at the club.

The aforementioned coverage will also be extended through the

contemplated interview of Miss EVELYN CAPPELLANO, paramour of

potential criminal informant if the fear ostensibly surrounding

her relationship with the GENOVESE family can be overcome.
