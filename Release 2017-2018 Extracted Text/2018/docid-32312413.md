present Haitian Government, and BALBUEN has furnished info

revolutionary activities. According to FRANCO, he and

LORENZO HALL (Miami file 2-345) happened to stop by the

Pizza Palace, 87th Avenue and 40th Street, Southwest, one

day last 4/63, and noted that LUIS BALBUENA's car was parked

outside the restaurant. They noticed BALBUENA was talking

with a person who was unknown to them, but whom FRANCO

subsequently saw enter a 1963 blue Grand Prix Pontiac.

I Subsequently, FRANCO asked BALBUEN what he was doing at the

Pizza Palace, and BALBUEN related to him the info set out

in the enclosed LIM. BALBUENA stated he and MOLINA wanted

to purchase some arms and equipment from SANTOS TRAFFICANTE,

isince they had heard he could supply this material. They

met TRAFFICANTE"s representative at the Pizza Palace, and

stated they wanted $5, 000.00 worth of arms and equipment,

and were willing to pay $600.00 down, plus a used car as

TRAFFICANTE's representative said he would

not give equipment based on this type of arrangement, but then

stated if MOLINA and BALBUENA could arrange to kill ELOY

GUTIERREZ MENOYO, they could have everything they wanted.

As set out in the LHM, TRAFFICANTE wants MENOYO killed because

he received $250,000.00 in arms and equipment from TRAFFICANTE,

but did not pay for them.
