1.

Reference: AZRWAHDO intelligence report, mentioned

that the Minister Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy in

Kingston, Jamaica addressed the regular monthly meeting of the

Communist Party of Cuba members assigned to Jamaica on 24 Sep-

tember 1977.

The MC said, among other things, that Cuban exiles

such as FNU DIAZ LAN and

others had been involved in the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy: The MC did not

further elaborate.

2. Latin America Division believes that the basis for

the MC's statement was, probably, an

article which appeared in

he New York Daily News on 20 September 1977. This article,

which is attached, quoted Maritza LORENZ as saying she, Orlando

busch, Frank STURGIS, Pedro DIAZ Lanz, two unnamed Cuban exile

brothers and Lee Harvey OSWALD formed

an assassination squad

which went to Dallas to assassinate President Kennedy. We know

of no information in Agency files to substantiate that state-

ment.
