that GOLITSYN, whose job in Finland source described as “Branch

2 of something", had clashed violently with his Resident in
Helsinki. He wrote a number of official and private letters to
Moscow asking that either he or the Resident. be transferred.
Headquarters refused to agree this, and when he visited Moscow
threatened that if he failed to get on with the Resident he

would be in danger.of losing his job. This was too much for
GOLITSYN, so he defected. Source added that this reason for
GOLITSYN's defection was convincing, and that he had never

3. Source gave the following information about the measures
taken by the K.G.B. as the result of GOLITSYN's defection:

(a) He had been sentenced to death; this was stated in
an article in "The Chekist" which appeared some time after

1964. The K.G.8. would try to kill him as soon as they
could find hia.

(b) Within six weeks of GOLUBEV's arrival in London on
12.6.71. he told sourcesthat he had received a telegram.
from Headquarters ordering him to concentrate on obtaining
information about GOLITSYN, (to whom the K.G.B. had given
the abusive nickname UROD), because according to their
information GOLITSYN had visited England several times,
and while they had now established “the place of residence”
they had no approach to him. Moscow requirec detailed
information asout where he was living, his habits and
activities. From the wording of this telegram source
deduced that GOLITS was not resident in Encland, and
that the object of this order.was to remind GOLUBEY of a
standing instruction that the highest priority was to be
given to obtaining information about him,
