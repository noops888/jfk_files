SECOND PHASE A MAJOR SOVIET FLEET UNIT sucy AS THE BALTIC FLEET Was TO.

HAVE BEEN INVITED TO VISIT CUBA ON. A CRUISE... ONCE aed PoRTS OF CUBA

“ERE SCREENED BY SOVIET FLEET UNITS, THE PRESENCE OF te tis “WAS ANTICIPATED
i . K ;
THAT THERE YOULD BE IN IMMEDIATE U.S. REACTION, BUT THE ‘PRESENCE - OF

SOVIET. FLEET UNITS SURROUNDING CUBA YAS CONSIDERED AN EFFECTIVE
GUARANTEE THAT THE U. Se ‘MOULD NOT RESORT TO IMMEDIATE. _ INVASION OR ;
<i

OTHER ARMED ACTION. TO ELIMINATE THE MISSILE THREAT.

Be. -THE PURPOSE OF..THIS ACTION WAS TO FORCE A MAJOR

CHANSE OF POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES TOWARDS CUBA. IT ‘was

ANTICIPATED. THAT U. S. REACTION WOULD BE VIOLENT, AND FROM THE
BEG GINNING THE PLAN CALLED. FOR THE. ULTIMATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE
OFFENSIVE WEAPONS. HOWEVER, THIS. WITHDRAWAL WAS TO HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED

THAT OF EFFECTING THE CHANGE OF THE U.S. POSITION, TOWARDS CUBA

WHICH WAS DESCRIBED. FOR INSTANCE THERE WAS NO INDICATION IN|

RAULITO ROA’S CONVERSATION THAT. HE SUSPECTED THAT THE
SOVIETS MIGHT HAVE INTENDED .TO USE THE PRESENCE OF THEIR
MISSILES. IN CUBA TO FORCE CHANGES IN U.S. POLICY TOWARDS
OTHER AREAS, FOR EXAMPLE RE‘BERLIN. .RAULITO ROA APPEARED
TO BE GENUINELY CONVINCED THAT THE PLAN. VAS AS HE DESCRIBED
Ree IT. © HE DID NOT STATE THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF. HIS INFORMATION.
“De THE DECISION TO ACCEDE TO U.S. DEMANDS RE THE i
EVACUATION OF THE OFFENSIVE WEAPONS: WAS TAKEN UNTLATERALLY
BY THE SOVIETS WITH No PRIOR WARNING TO OR CONSULTATION wits
-CUBAN LEADERS. DESPITE THE ‘PREMATURE DISCLOSURE OF THE
PRESENCE OF SOVIET MISSILES IN CUBA, FIDEL CASTRO WAS SO
CERTAIN THAT THE SOVIET FLEET WAS GOING TO ARRIVE IN CUBAN.
WATERS ACCORDING TO PLAN THAT :WHEN HE HEARD THAT PREMIER
KHRUSHCHEV HAD AGREED TO ACCEPT AMERICAN DEMANDS RE THE
EVACUATION OF OFFENSIVE WEAPONS FROM CUBA HE CONCLUDED +

A. THE ATTITUDE OF CUBAN LEADERS, FROM FIDEL

CASTRO ON DOWN, TOWARDS THE SOVIET FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT |
THE, SECOND PHASE OF THE SOVIET-CUBAN PLAN BY MOVING THE :
SOVIET FLEET INTO PLACE, AND THE SUBSEQUENT FAILURE TO c-
CONSULT WITH CUBAN LEADERS BEFORE YIELDING TO U.S.’ DEMAND

FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF OFFENSIVE MISSILES WAS ONE OF DISMAY,
ANGER AND DISAPPOINTMENT. THE REACTION OF THE CUBAN LEADERS WAS

CONCENTRATED FAR MORE ON THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS HAD BROKEN THEIR
WORD RE THE MOVEMENT OF THE SOVIET FLEET INTO CUBAN WATERS AND”

ON THE SOVIET UNILATERAL ACTION IN ACCEDING TO AMERICAN

DEMANDS, THAN IT WAS,ON THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS HAD

CAPITULATED TO THE AMERICAN DEMANDS PER SE. THE CUBAN

LEADERS ‘CONSIDERED THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAD BESNIRCHED

ITS OWN HONOR AND THAT IT HAD OFFENDED THE PRIDE OF CUBA. AT

PRESENT THE CUBAN LEADERS CONTINUE TO POSSESS STRONG FEELINGS
ON THESE POINTS.
3. THE ANGER OF THE CUBAN LEADERSHIP AGAINST

SOVIET UNION FOR THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS.
