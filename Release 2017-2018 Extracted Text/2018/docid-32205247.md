The episode of the British ship and sugar shipment in Puerto RiCo

illustrates again the unwisdom of ad hoc procedures for dealing with

covert political action matters. The purpose of this memorandum is

not so much to protest that INn, which has responsibility in these matters.

was neither consulted nor informed, but to recommend that Mongoose,

like all other covert political action matters, be handled through the

mechaniem which was set up for such pauposes in INR/DDC and which

has operated successfully without either leaks or mistakes due to in-

adequate staffing for several years.

The facts in this particular matter have come to me from half a

dozen sources today. I think there are serious questions about the mérite

of the case. But my major point is that neither the President nor the

Secretary have been appropriately served in this instance because of

inadequate staffing, and that this would not have happened had Mongoose

been handled in the regular highly secure procedures followed by INR/DDC

rather than the ad hoc ones of Mongoose.

Our specialty is to provide first some technical expertise on such

matters; second, to protect security; and, third, to see that all those who

have a legitimate responsibility in such a matter also have an opportunity

to exercise their responsibility. The views of EUR, especially SOV,

should have been sought and would have been sought had the matter been

handled by the regular covert political action procedures.

Things like this will continue to happen so long as such delicate

and at the same time involved matters are handied on an ad hoc basis..

and I strongly urge that immediate steps be taken to put them back into

the special group procedures where they belong.
