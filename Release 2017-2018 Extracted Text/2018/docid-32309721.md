Lieutenant BRUCE SIMMONS and Detective Sergeant ARTHUR

M. LEONARD (NA) have continued during the past six months

to afford excellent cooperation to this office.

Generally

speaking,

it appears that this Department has continued to

improve in organization, discipline and morale. During the

period covered by this report there has been no wide-open

gambling and there has been a definite absence of open

bookmaking and other forms of vice. Sneak gambling, such

as betting on horses and sporting events, has continued, but

no évidence has come to the attention of

this office

indicating that there is an organized pay off to the Police

Department, or "okay" from the Police Department for the

operation of such.

There has been the usual speculation that there

will be sneak "bust out" gambling houses in operation on

nat our

Miami Beach during the coming winter season, but as yet in-

formation has been

non-specific and nothing

has been learned

which would be indicative of police venality in this matter..-
