GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE INTELLIGENCE FILE
on BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA
JUNE 1, 1955 TO DECEMBER 1, 1955

The following information was obtained during the
course of regular investigation by Special Agents JOSEPH I.
GREALY, DENNIS ‘J. O'SHEA and BEN W. GRIGSBY:

A. ORGANIZED GANGS :
Investigation and contacts with informants and”
sources of information have failed to give any indication ~
that there are any organized gangs in Broward County at the
present time.

‘On July 9, 1955, MM-322-C. advised that’ JAKE SKY,
Hollywood, Florida, had flown from Miami to_Havana,..Cuba; on -
July 8, 1955, to join his brother, MEYER LANSKY, FBI # 791783,
who had proceeded to Cuba from New York City; P: KASTEL, &
of New Orleans; and other unidentified syndicate neibers. from*
Las Vegas, Nevada. Informant stated that a meéting was currently
being held at Havana whereby these ‘members of the National Crime
Syndicate were considering the purchase of a hotel or a gambling
casino in Havana,

On July 22, °1955, MM-551-PC advised-that MEY
had been in Havana, Cuba during the early part of July,”
for two reasons: (1) as a guest of the Cuban Government t6 aA
discuss the possibility of his bringing the mén into Cuba” to
operate ‘gambling, He explained that BATISTA wanted American” ~~
tourists in Havana and was concerned.over the strong possibility
that "bust-out operations" would keep the American trade’ away.

(2) To look over the possibility of purchasing a hotel in the)
heart of Havana for the purposes of operating gambling theréin,

_ Informant stated that LANSKY had pointed out that it -
would be difficult to attract competent men away from Las Vegas,

Docld:32309721 Page 3


MM 62-1273

because most of them had settled down there and were content
to stay there. With regard to the second proposition, he
stated that LANSKY might go into the purchase of a hotel if
he could form a syndicate to put up the money to purchase
same.

On November 8, 1955, MM-551~PC stated that the
LANSKY brothers had still not made any deal whereby they
would take over a hotel and operate a gambling casino in
Havana, Cuba. He added that they were still discussing
the possibility with a syndicate in New York City, but that
no definite decision had been made to date,

B. INDIVIDUAL RACKETEERS AND MOBSTERS

It was noted that in contacting informants and ~~
their sources of information, it was repeatedly pointed out
that individual racketeers and the mobsters for the most
part were not in the area during the past six months in
view of/the fact that this is the off season for the Florida

—LI 2taty

The "Miami Herald," under date of November 15, 1955,
reported that JOE ADONIS had agreed to deport himself by
January 1, 1956, and that in return for that move he would be
allowed to avoid serving a prison term for perjury. It was
pointed out that ADONIS intended to go to Italy.

~~ MM 572-C reports that JACK: BUTLER, mentioned above,

-is tied in with the TRAFFIGANTE boys from Tampa, Florida;

however,-the exact nature of the tie-up is not know. ‘The
informant feels that possibly the TRAFFICANTES are bankrolling
BUTLER in his operation.

MM 572-C reports that one EDDY PHILLIPSXGUEST,
FBI #320853, a hustler, and gambler,is now residing at the
“RIVIERA 1 HOTEL, Holly Hill, Florida, GUEST is reported to be
sickly and is “having a hard time existing. He is reportedly
mooching off of JACK BUTLER.

reported that one ELZA RGAN , FBI #2484916, is now residin,

at New-Smyrna_Beach,, Florida, and is promoting Stock car races
at DeLand, Florida. MORGAN was released on parole from Atlanta
Federal Penitentiary in October, 1954, after serving time for
ITSMV.

C. POLITICAL TIE-UPS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME:

MM 572-C reports that BaxwonD V:}eNEMAR, Deputy
Sheriff of Volusia County.,-Flonida has recently. approached several
bo a sellers in the city "for a percentage or else," but he
knows of no payoff to McNEMAR.
D. POLICE EFFICIENCY ; -

HENRY LeROY ALLEN is Chief of Police, Daytona Beach,
Florida, and he is reported to be having trouble with internal
bickering among members of the department. Mayor FRANCIS
MORRISON reported that ALLEN was on the verge of being ousted;
but to date no poSitive action has been taken by the City Commission,

The Department now consists of fifty men, there having
been several resignations recently due to low starting salaries,
Lt. DALTON SMITH heads the Detective Bureau. and the general
reaction of the public is that the police are doing a relatively
Zood job, but there is reported to be much room for improvement.

made several trips to Miami during the summer of 1955 in
connection with the gambling charge which was out standing
against him for being active in the operation of a bookmaking
establishment and "bust out" gambling casino at theXEmpress ,.

Lieutenant BRUCE SIMMONS and Detective Sergeant ARTHUR

H. LEONARD {NA) have continued during the past six months
to afford excellent cooperation to this offica. Generally
speaking, it appears that this Department has continued to
improve in organization, discipline and morale. During the
period covered by this report there has been no wide-open
gambling and there has been a definite absence of open
bookmaking and other forms of vice. Sneak gambling, such
as betting on horses and sporting events, has continued, but
no évidence has come to the attention of this office
indicating that there is an organized pay off to the Police
Department, or "okay" from the Police Department for the
operation of such.

. There has been the usual speculation that there
will be sneak "bust out" gambling houses in operation on
Miami Beach during the coming winter season, but as yet in-
formation has been non-specific and nothing has been learned
which would be indicative cf police venality in this matter.,.

The only data which has come to our attention which
would make us skeptical of the integrity of Chief ROMEO J.
SHEPARD was ‘a report received in August, 1954, by the New
York Office from its informant, NY¥+204-C, who has furnished
reliable information in the past. This was to the effect
that NY-204-C advised that he had become quite friendly with
SALVATORE GRANELLO, FBI # 2120006. In the course of conversations
with GRANELLO, this hoodlum mentioned various contacts he had ~-
in Miami and Miami Beach. The informant stated that GRANELLO
particularly mentioned having a “big in" with Chief of Police
SHEPARD at Miami Beach. According to the informant, GRANELLO
stated that SHEPARD was the "bag man" in Miami Beach, and ~
GRANELLO stated he had eaten dinner with Chief SHEPARD on q-
few occasions. :

. The informant furnished this information in”
connection with the investigation of the matter entitled,
"CARMINEXDI BIASE, was., - FUGITIVE, UFAP - MURDER." GRANELLO
is report “the ¢losest associate of this fugitive and is
suspected of having harbored him.

GONTAS out of Tarpon Springs. He said MACK ANDERSON has
formerly headed up SAGONIAS outfit in St. Petersburg, but that
he has been unable to establish to date whether or not such
an organization does exist. It should be noted, as will be
set forth later, SAGONIAS is due to enter Federal Prison any
day. .

VERGONTAS of three or four unknown writers under NICK

Detective QUILLIGAN further advised that it is diffi
cult to determine which writer is writing for which organizae
tion because there is indication that they are.changing from
one group to another fairly frequently. He said that some of
the names furnished above have been convicted and served a
few months time in the past year and are out again, some are ~
waiting sentence, some are in but will be out shortly, however,
all are known bolita writers and undoubtedly will be in oper-
ation from time to time in these groups.

MM-416-G has advised that to the best of his know=-
ledge the following groups are operating bolita in the Ste
Petersburg-Pinellas. County areas Group number one is the
TRAFFICANTEs, MM-416-C states that he bedieves the TRAFFI- .-

~\ PANTES are still operating through ANDR! IGHT, JOSEPH .
Ws ? and possibly ALFRED HI COLE, all of whom were con=
‘icted with the TRAFFICANTEs ¢arty in 1955 and who have :
appeals pending in Supreme Court of Florida. This informant
stated that he believes approximately 80% of the TRAFFICANTE
peddlers: who were operating at the time of the mass raids in
May, 1954 are still peddling bolita.

Group number two is. the FABIAN group.. The informant
states that he believe is group is operating in St. Peters-
burg with TONY and J OPEZ as their pick up men. He
says that they have abou én writers in St. Petersburg, but
that the peddlers are not being contacted directly. He wa

unable to.furnish additional information regarding this
group at this time.

~ SIROTLEGLEABLAN one of Tampa's most poriausgamblers, was Vila
\ arrested Tampa... In. a. search of his. apartment evidence —
S| was seized showing a tie-up-with bolita operations in:St.
fy Petersburg. This arrest was supposed to have been made as | «~
‘S a result. of a combined investigative effort of the Pinellas
-Gounty Sheriff's Office and the Hillsborough County Sheriff's
Office. There were reportedly about 1,000 tickets which ~

&

H were lay over bets from'the St. Petersburg area, indicating
x ; a large operation in St, Petersburg.

Concerning FABIAN's arrest, Detective Sergeant HARRY
DIETRICH of the St. Petersburg. Police Department stated to the _
newspapers "FABIAN's organization is the largest threat we —
have here in St. Petersburg, second only to the’ TRAFFICANTEs.
The TRAFFICANTE gang grossed a million dollars yearly before
their conviction in Pinellas County of lottery law violations."

PETE BENSE, PCI, advised that during the past sev-~-
eral months the TRAFFICANTEs had an operation in northern ~
Pinellas which had been knocked off by the Sheriff's Office
and that it was no longer active. He said that this'was a _
very small operation and the knock off was in the form of
a small arrest action.

GENUNG stated that GASPAR LA MOTT is operating a
combination with MRS. JOHN IPPOLITO, wife of "STRAW HAT
JOHNNY" IPPOLITO, who is now serving a sentence after convic-
tion in United States District Court, Tampa, on a wagering
stamp violation.

Chief Criminal Deputy GENUHG advised that with the
preak up of these three combinations there is little activity
right now in Glearwater and northern Pinellas County area;

-but that he expects an immediate renewal any day.

. GENUNG stated that early in 1955 the Sheriff's
Office was using the technique of obtaining search warrants
for moonshine to make bolita cases. He stated that this
arose from moonshine activity on the part of bolita operators
after the conviction of the TRAFFICANTEs in Pinellas County
in the spring of 1955 and the resultant decline in bolita
sales. He stated that this was successful for a period but
was changed after several arrests.

GENUNG advised that within the past month he has
been contacted twice by PETE BENSE, bondsman, Clearwater, -
a PCI of this office, hinting that is a “local” man were %
operating the bolita there would be less criticism from the
population and enforcement would be easier if arrangements
could be made for regular arrests and fines be ‘levieds”
GENUNG stated that he did not know BENSE's principal as he ~
had clearly advised that nothing such as this plan would even
be considered by Sheriff SID SAUNDERS or by himself, GENUNG.

. As set forth earlier it should be recalled that
PCI PETE BENSE advised that he had obtained ¥500 000 at.-2%
interest to use in his business operations and also stated””
that he intended to back Justice of the Peace ED SILK“in th
approaching Sheriff's campaign. BENSE alse made ‘the state .
ment that “what..was..good for PETE BENSE would have to be good
for Pinellas County.7 _ .

All violations indicated in this report have “been.
referred to the preper authorities for investigative action.

are hurt by allegations of a Mafia. :
It is specifically noted that hereinafter, informa-

tion reported concerning any crimes or local situations have

' This group, over the many years, has been alleged to YY
| operate bolita, numbers racket and to have been associated.in a ~
group commonly referred to as the Mafia.

The activity during this period for the above, namely
concerns their allegations of being members of the Mafia and to
have substantially backed NICK C. NUCCIO to the office of Mayor “
and the Italian group thereby would have controlled Tampa a
politics. The allegations were made that the head of this group ~
is now SALVATORE SCAGLIONE, FBI #355220B, and this allegation
was made by Lieutenant DANIEL ALVAREZ; the other head of this
group is now ANGELO BEDAMI, FBI #1849088, whom it was alleged
by ALVAREZ that the latter two are called "Mr." by the other
Italians in this group, thereby giving them their position of
respect in the Italian erouP This latter information may be _
possibly true in that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR. has moved his forces
according to reliable confidential information received :
through CI HAV-11 at Havana,’Cuba, wherein it has been reported

that TRAFFICANTE was operating a numbers racket in the
Hot. evilla-Biltmore in Havana. and that he has political
backing there in the same manner as previously obtained in

. Tampa, in that a -law has now been: passed to allow the numbers
y to operate there. The Sevilla om Hotel was owned by

is particularly noted that SHADLETSKY has a long record for:
narcotics and that-DANNY LEWIS, New York City PD # B-246389,

has a conviction for narcotics, and it has been reliably re-
ported that they are setting up in Havana, Cuba,—It is noted
that on telephone checks during this period that these individuals
have numerous contacts all over the country, and that such in-
dividuals also have contacts with SALVATORE GRANELLO, FBI #
2120006, and his partner, GEORGE LEVINE, FBI # 382915, and that
these individuals both have operated for many years in Havana,
Cuba, and New York City, and are considered big-time hoodlums,

It is also noted that at this time that in checking GI O's
telephone records, there are numerous calls to one S EIN .

in Tampa, Florida, and it is particularly noted at’ this' time that
SAM KLEIN is a brother of GEORGE KLEIN, former PCI, and SAM KLEIN
has personally advised Special Agent, STEPHEN J. LABADIE that he
is without a doubt going to run for Sheriff of Hillsborough County
in 1956. It is also personally reported by GEORI IN to £42.
