Your assistance is requested in interviewin,

in determining the accuracy of certain claims made confidentially by

Herbert L, ITKIN, Mr, ITKIN is a prime witness in legal proceedinga presently
underway in New York City involving the Maia and related underworld organiza-
tions, ITKIN lives under the protection of U.S, Federal Marshals,

2. The following data is for your information. It should not be used in
dealing with| Fr outside of this Cryznization, ITKIN has been an

FBI informant since March 1963, He has now claimed to have worked for this
Organization during the period 1954/55 to 1960. ITIKIN asserts that his contact
during these years was one Philip HARBIN, This inquiry is concerned solely
with ITKIN's claimed relationship with this Organization from 1954/55 to 1960
when he alleges HARBIN was his contact. As will be scen| J TKIN
alleges, also knsw HASBIN during that time and that fact, therefore,

material to the credibility of ITKIN's story.

ITHIN's first coutact with Philip HARBIN was im 1955 when he claims to
have been contacted purcuant to a mecting he, ITKIN, had in Philadelphia with
a leading personality of this Organization and another high-government official
late in 1954 or early 1555. According to ITKIN, HARBIN never made the
specific claim of being fromi this Organization but that was ITKIN's aseumption.

ITKIN describes HARBIN as about 42 or 43 (in 1955}, an American.
He had receding heir, combed back but parted. He was about 5'8" in height,

well-built with little evidence of fat. He always wore a vest, He spoke fluent
Spanish and could have been'of Polish or Russiax family background, HARBIN
always drank tea, never coffee, He appeared aiiluent with a professorial air

about him,

Following an initial-mecting, ITHIN at: aud TARD OS rf
periodically in New York City, ITKIN alleges that he p passed to HARBIN copies
of the correspondence developed by his law firm, Deleon, Levin and Gordon,
dealing with Indonesia, Burma, and India, ITKIN left that law firm in mid-1957,
presumably thereby losing total access. Among the materials ITKIN claims he
passed to HARBIN before he left the Delson, Levin and Gordon firm was informa-

tion he picked up from 2 who worked at the United Nations for the
Government of.) Thie friend wae ses bs cede

eketch, Attachment A), ITKIN claims that he became very friendly with
who was studying either at New York University or Columbia

where he prepared a master's thesis o: economic position.

HARBIN, he says, was interested in the topic and ITKIN alleges he furnished

HARBIN notes of| monograph,

Sometime presumably after mid-year 1957, HARBIN asked ITKIN if he
knew anybody else who could do (intelligence) work, ITKIN recalled)
who meanwhile had moved tojthe position as Consul General o} 7”

HARBIN--ITKIN says--accepted the suggestion and
ITKIN provided an introduction for HARBIN by letter, which he sent td
in ITKIN asserts that HARBIN--according to his.own statement--
went td land made the "new contact", ITKIN claims he last saw
HARBIN in 1960,

3. A comparison between the key points of ITKIN's account as sunumarized
in the immediately preceding paragraph with the data set out in Attachment A and
E will show immediate contradictions that tend to destroy any credibility in
ITKIN's account, particularly with respect to his relationship to|

We also point out, solely for your information, that we have found no confirma-,. ||

tion in our records of any relationship between this Organization aid ITKINi
the period 1954-1960, No traces have been found in our records or an:
government thus far of a Philip HARBIN, and there is explicit denial t

any meeting in Philadelphia in 1954 between ITKIN and the high officials he
nominates, Finally, there is no substantiation in our files of any of the intelli-
gence product which ITKIN allegedly passed to HARBIN, This case, however, is
of such a nature that we must strive, if possible, to have own
statement for the record,

4. We leave to the Station determination of the best manner to approach
lit is our preference that a Station officer, under suitable cover,
perform the interview, but it may well be that a consular or embassy officer
might be the best person to do the job. We repeat that we are concerned in this
matter solely with the verification or denial of ITKIN's statements, specifically
the allegation that he introduced HARBIN in Xf jand
that as a consequenc would be in @ position to identify and describe
HARBIN in a way that would permit us to locate him if he exists, The request
for| assistance in this matter is in no way predicated upon hostility
towards ITKIN nor is there any predisposition against his claims if indeed 7
evidence is found to back them up. I) indicates that he is willing to
provide whatever information he can, you can assure him that his information is
solely for U.S, Government use and will not be made public by us at any time
without his expreased consent. Also, it is clear that we are prepared to accept

ITKIN, Again, the content of this letter tends to support the theory that iTKIN's
story, as elaborated in paragraph 2 above, is 2 fabrication, While possibly based
on a real relationship, it appears to be a fabrication with respect to chronology
and with respect to the exact mutual interests involved, Also included in this
attachment is ITKIN's answer to the letter. We feel in retrospect that

might be unhappy to read his own letter in the course of a consular

interview, We, therefore, suggest that thie not be'shown to him. However,
there is no objection to an indication that the U.S, Government is aware that

was in perfectly correct correspondence with ITKIN during 1965 on
