Their names are included, however, to give a comprehensive

list of persons

formerly from these states now engaged in the

Nevada Gambling Industry.

No leads are being set out to

further develop background information

on these persons

unless requested by Las Vegas:

HERBERT MORRIS GROBER;

SAM SOLOMON;

VINCENT DOMINICK SILVESTRI;

FRANK JOSEPH MOONEY;

JACKIE FIELDS;

ITALO GHEFI;

BEN KELLERMAN.

Prior investigation regarding WILLIAM "BILLY"

CONN and MILTON JAFFE previously furnished to Las Vegas

in connection with other investigative matters is

being set out in detail in this report since these

individuals are prominent in the Nevada Gambling Industry.

No leads are being set out by Pittsburgh to

further develop information regarding WILLIAM "BILLY"

CONN, MILTON JAFFE, ESCAR RAPPE, and RALPH F: ANGELO;

however, their activities will be followed through

Pittsburgh informants and any information developed

will be furnished to Las Vegas and Newark, as well as the

Bureau.

For the information of Las Vegas, PG-696-PC

has stated in the recent past that he desires to obtain

$5,000, which will make it possible for him to accept an

offer made to him by "FOOTS" ARCADIA for the purchase of

a restaurant-gambling casino at Boulder City, Nevada.

Also, for the information

of Las Vegas, the

"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette," a Pittsburgh newspaper,

dated

8/12/64, contained an article captioned,

"3 Pittsburghers

Seek Nevada Casino Shares." The article in effect stated

that three Pittsburgh men have applied to the Nevada Gaming

Commission for shares in

a new casino to be opened in las

Vegas next fall.

These individuals have been identified as

GABRIEL RUBIN, HERBERT S. COHEN, and Attorney DAVID KAUFMAN.

In addition,

the Associated Press reports that three persons

already are

licensed to open the casino

next fall.

They

include Mayor A. RIDDLE, President of the Dunes Hotel-Casino,

his wife, NORMA, and Attorney LOUIS WEINER, JI.
