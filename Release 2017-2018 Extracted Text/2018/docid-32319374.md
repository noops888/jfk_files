RACIAL MATTERS (KLAN)

A Bureau source who is very close to Robert Shelton, Imperial
Wixerd, United Klans of Am@ica, Inc., Knights of the Ru Klux Klan, kas
advised that Lester Chalmers, Shelton's attorney, met with Congressman
Edwin E, Willis, Chairman of the House Committee on UneAmerican Activitice,
during the weekend of November 6, 1965, possibly in New Orleans. Tar ing
this meeting Chalmers explained to Willis the story concerning Lee Oswnid's
Anvolvemont in some bombings in Alabama.

You will recall that this source previously advised that shortiy
vefore the assassination of former President Jobn F. Kennedy, Shelton
i was allegedly contacted by James Venable, leader of the National Knighta
| of the Ku Kiux Klan, Venable indicated that Oswald had been active in
some bombings in Alabama and offered the services of Oswald to Shelton,
which afer Shelton declined. Shelton, according to the source, also
related that Oswald was in Atlanta, Georgia, when former President Kennedy
was scheduled to speak at Georgia Tech, The speech was cancelled, but
according to Shelton, Oswald engaged in some pickéting activity and was
photographed, The Atlanta Office has checked with one of our informants,
| who ws allegedly in on the meeting between Shelton and Venable, and the
' informant advised that no such meeting took place. The Atlanta Office has
also previously checked on allegations regarding Oswald'spresene in Atlaniz
prior to the assassination of President Kennedy and has determined that
ali such allegations were not factusl,

| According to our source, Chalmers indicated that Willis was
i amazed with the above story as told to him by Chalmers but made no

i comuitment other than to say that he (Willis) weuld contact Chalmers
when he returned to Washington, B. C.

Source also advised that Willis had told Chalmers that Sheritr
| Newt Lowe was engaged in a run-off campaign for re-election and had to
be protected if he was going to win. We previously received information
that Willis is trying te arrange for Chalmers to represent Sheriff Lowe
during Lowe's appearance before the Comaittee. Sheriff Lowe had been
amenber of the Jonesbore, Louisiana, Unit of the United Klans of america
and «is. from the Congressional District of Otto Pasesman, Democrat of
Louisiana.

Memorandum Baumgardner to Sullivan
RE: HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES
ae INVESTIGATIONS

The source further advised that Robert Scoggins, Grand Dragon
for the State of South Carolina, had been notified by the Veterans
Administration that his disability pension has been reduced. Shelton
feels that this was 2 retdliatory measure taken by the Committee and the
Veterans Administration against Scoggins. Therefore, the Klan is
lodging a protest with the American Legion and the Disabled American
Veterans. Shelton stated that when Raymond Anderson, the Grand Dragon
for the State of Tennessee, appears to testify before the Committee,
Shelton and members of ‘the press would accompany Anderson to the Veterans
Administration to inquire if Anderson's disability pension will also be
reduced. i+ Ee

It is noted that Anderson is a Bureau informant, who while
serving in the Armed Perces during the Korean Conflict lost his left
ara. This loss entitled him te a disability pension.

Observations:

Chairman Willis is being contacted by Assistant Director
DeLoach concerning the information furnished to him by Chaimers regarding
Oswald and to advise Willis that the information is not factual. It
appears that Shelton is circulating the story in order to possibly
discredit Venable, who: he feels has furnished information to the
Committee concerning Shelton and Shelton's Elan organization, Although
Venable did testify in executive session, a review of the testimony
indicates that he furnished little or no information of value, and
Shelton’s assumption is erroneous.

The information regarding Shelton's proposed visit to the
Veterans Administration is known only to a limited number of individuals
including the source and Anderson, who is also a Bureau informant, In
the event we advise the Veterans Administration of this matter, it could
possibly result in the loss of two valuable sources since the Veterans
Administration may reveal that they had advance knowledge of this visit.
it is not believed that any real harm will be caused by this action on
the part of Shelton and, therefore, it is felt that the Veterans
Administration should not be advised.

We have previously advised the White House and the Attorney

. General rogarding Willis" actions with regard to Sheriff Lowe.

RACIAL MATTERS (KLAN)

A source of the Bureau who 4g serving as Public
Relations Director for Robert U. Shelton, Imperial Wizard,
United Klans of America, Inc., Knights of the Ku Klux Elan,
has furnished information obtained by him during Bis contacts
with Shelton, E

According to Shelton, about two weeks before the
assassination of former President John F, Kennedy, he was
in contact with James Venable, a lender of another Klan
organization. Venable told Shelton that he was in contact
vith Lee Oswald and that Oswald bad been active in some
bombings in Alabama, Venable offered the services of Oswald
to Shelton and stated he could be used by both °
Shelton stated he declined Venable's offer and that this
declination was made in the presence of Calvin Craig (Grand
Dragon of Ehelton's organization) and Bob Thompson (Vice
President of Shelton's organization and a racial informant).
Shelton also stated thet according to Venable, Oswald was in
Atlanta, Georgia, at a tine when former President John F.

was scheduled te speak before a Georgia Tech group.
This speaking engagement was canceled and he did not appear
in Atlanta; however, there was some picketing activity in
Hurt (phonetic) Park, Atlanta, and the source got the impression
the Atlanta newspapers at this time contained information or
a photograph that will prove Oswald was in Atlante at that tine.
Shelton further clains that he saw a registration card for
etry while he was staying in one ef the Marriott Motels in

Be.

fs Shelton told his Attorney, Lester Chalmers, to get in
touch with Congressman Edwin D, Willis, Chairman of the above-
captioned Committee. According to our source, Chalmers con-
taeted Congressman Willis and arranged to meet him in New Orleans
en the evening of 11-5-65, Chalmers intends to present
Shelton's story to Willis but not to make any recommendations,

to Willis as to what he should do. [ff Willie vants to talk

Hemorandua to Mr, ¥. C, Sullivan
RE: NOUSE COMMITTER ON UN-AWERICAN ACTIVITIES
ELAN INVESTIGATIONS

SAC Ponder of the Atlanta Office advised on 11-5-65
that Robert Thompson, our informant, stated that no meeting
such as Shelton described ever took piace, SAC Ponder further
advised thet at the time of President Kennedy$s death, there
vere nunerous allegations that Oswald had been in Atlanta
and these allegations were given considerable newspaper
publicity, The allegations were thoroughly and completely
iuvestigated by the Bureau and found to be false. It is
believed Shelton was aware of the newspaper publicity con-
cerning Oswald being in Atlanta; therefore, he concocted
the above story. It is to he acted that Shelton according
to a Washington Field source believes Venable is furnishing
information to captioned Committee concerning his (Shelton's)
organization.

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of the. above, no action should be taken in
this matter.
