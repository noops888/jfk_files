The source further advised that Robert Scoggins,.

Grand Dragon

for the state of south carolina, had been notified by the

Veterans

soninistretion that his disability pension has been reduced.

Shelton

feels that this was a retallatory neasure taken by the Committee and the

Veterans Adninistration against Scoggins. Therefore, the Klan 1s

lodging & protest with the Anerican Legion and the Disabled Anerican

Shelton stated that when Rayaond Anderson, the Grand Dragon

for the State of Tennessee, appears to testily before the Connittee,

Shelton and members of the press would accompany Anderson to the Veterans

Administration to Inguire if Anderson's disability pension will also be

reduced.

It is noted that Anderson is a Bureau informant, who while

serving in the Armed Forces during the Koroan Confliet lost his left

art. This loss entitled him to a disability pension.

Observations:

Chairman W1111s

is being contaeted by Assistant Director

Deloach concerning the informetion furnished to him by Chalners regarding

Oswald and to advise Willis that the information is not factual.

appears that Shelton is circulating the story in order to possibly

discredit Venable, whoe, he feels has furnished information to the

Committee concerning Shelton and Shelton's Elan organization.

Although

Venable did testify in esecutive session, a review of the testimony

Indicates that be furnished little or no

information of value, and

Sholton's assumption 1s erroneous.

The Information regarding Shelton's proposed visit to the

Veterans Aininistration is known only to a linited nunber of individuals

including the source and Anderson, who to also a Bureau informant. In

the ovent we advise the veterans Acministration of this matter, it coule

possibly result to the loss o1 two valuable sources since the Veterans

Adninistration nay reveal that thoy had advanco knowledge of this visit.

It is not belteved that any real harm will be caused by this action on

the part of Shelton and, therefore, it is felt that the Veterans

Aninistration should not be advised.

We have previously advised the White House and the Attorney

General

rogarding Willis' actions with regard to shoriff love.
