1. I not Subject at the National Airport vies he arrived trom Atlanta

at about 2115 and took hin to the Statler Hotel. Fe told ne that in late

January or early february be had begun aczing as broker for sone exchange

transactions invoirtag dubaa peso in the patta posalon of former

Batista followers in the Miand area. During the course of these transacticas

he became acquainted with a number of Cubans, most of them former followers

of Satiste who are engaged in plotting against the CASTHO Guverment in

Cuba.

2. Together with Manuel Firestone, aka Yanuel Fueso, a US eitizen of

Cuban orfstn who served in the RCAT during horld war II and one of the US

ared forces during the Korean war) Wer Bell went to the Dominican Republic

about 6 weeks ago. The purpose of the trip was to see Batista and sell him

on a public relations carpaign which might help his restabilsh his

reputation in the United Stäes. Her Bell did nos see Batista personally,

but it Firestone did. her Bell met with a number of Cuban exiies on

raríors occasions and becare convinced that it was not possible to deal with

Basista since the latter insisted on postponirg everything "until he comes

to the States". Strestone arranged to bring her beil into contact with Gen

Jose Pedraz, and separatey, Ediardo todriguez, Maa: el De Mora's nephew, and

through him Manuel De Moga. He discussed only a mitile relations campalga

o7 behalf of the Dominican Repolic with De Hoja.

3. Pedraze, on the basis of der Bell's OSS Dickeround, asked him for

night he implied to me that he had had combal experience. My personal assess-

nent of fier tell follows at the end of this menorandum.) fier Bell said he

asked PedrazAlf he was in touch with CIA, Pedrazsaid be was not in contact

but that the others, raaning the Deminicans, were, ler Bell said the Cubang

are training a minimin of 2,000 troops in the Dominican Republic. There are

also about « 1,000 Spandards wout sent by FRA'CO. her tell said he

recomr.ended

to Pedrazza typica, abel ent operation to organize a period

COR RILLED

guerrilla area, with supply drops, and the organization of extensive communi-

cation facilities.

Lo Batista has refisco to cooperate with Pedrazland lo is refusing

to provide any funds for the operation. He says that he expects to be in

the Inited States within the weeks and will then negotlate provisioned of

support. Rolando Mansferred is collecting funds in the US for the revolt.

In addition to this, the Dominicans are buying arms wherever they can get

their hands on then. Tre plan is to make Munez Portrondo Provisional

President as

soon as CASTRO is overthrown.

So ler Bell cald that an Extra businessman nazed jones shu, who

stashax does business in Europe and Xian in Mani bycinz real estate,

had mentioned to hin the possibility of obtaining the services of 1,000

experienced Gernan combat troops who are organized, officered, and equipped,

Loosfoe,

at the rate of $100 a day per man. An individual naned hand, belleved to

be a Swiss staying at the laldorf Astoria Hotel, 1s the contact for getting

the services of these somans. Los 19 merely an intermediary and Fres (mi,

whose nationality 1s uninowi, but bellered so be & jerman, 1s the principal

of this ercup. (Contents when da questioned her "ezl about this he was

very reluctant to go into detalls, and as the story developed it appeared

to me that he was taking for granted a typical night club story resulting

from loose talk by hirself and the individual called ¿ones.)

6o lier tell said he had been virtually offered command of the Cuban

counter revolutionary force. He said that he w1ll engage in this only 15

CIA backs him up. He sants to organize a para-military force and needs 15

to 20 Py experts including communicators to train the force. de also wants

sore specialized equipment such as fire borbs, radios, and even mentiored

2L-F8l aircraft. (Comments I believe the Dominicans have been trying to

buy euch aircraft for sone time for from the Canadian Government. The

Canadiens, however, hara refused it the United States' request to grant

export licenses for the planes.)

%. her Bell wants to see Gen. Cabell or Allen Dulles on this matter.

He says he is willing to aet as our agent and believes he can gain the

completo confidence of Pedrazand De Moya. He sald that it 18 rupored in

Mand that the United States had offerd 76 hours af hands off in the event

of an attempt against CiSTiC and will close its eyes to a rumber of gun

shipments.

l. lier Bell admitted to me that he had had some business difficulties

in the recent past and was now working his way out of then. he have his

record through 19i5 and ke appears to be a responsible citizen as of that

time. The inpression that I got of hin last night is that he is now à typical

8203

proncter type of the bast successful varlety found in Latin inerica, prones

to exagrerated ideas end sonerhat naive,as evidenced by his story of the

1,000 Germans. I carefully avoided the question of what he stands to

gain by all of this, but as the story developed it becomes rather obvious

that ke l9 seeking to ast a a broker a CIA sypot for Pedraza and probably

anticipates collecting his brokerage fees in tems of publie relations con-

tracts wax fron the Dominicans and the new Cuban Government. It 1s also

obvious that Subject has good access to intelligence which may be of consid

erable value, particularly 11 it becomes necessary to initiate political

action operations against the CASTRO Covernment.
