MEMORANDIM OF CONVERSATION”
SUBJECT: : cee \

PARTICIPANTS: Mitchell L. wer Sell and! . :

1. I met Subject at the National Airport wnea he arrived ‘from Atlanta
‘i at about 2115 and took hin to the Statler Hotel. Ke told me that in late
Jansary or early February he had begun acting as broker for sone exchange
transactions involving Cuban pesos fn the paxtktmoax possession of former
is Batista followers in the Miani area. During the course ef these transactions

he became acquainted with a mnber of Cubans, most of than forner followers
of Batista who are engaged in plotting against the CASTKO Government in
Cuba.

2. Together with Mamel Firestone, aka Mamel Fuegoa(e US eftizen of
Cuban origin who se-ved in the RCAF during World War IT and_one of the US
armed forces during the Korean wax) Wer Bell went to the Doninican Republic
about 6 weeks ago. The purpose of the trip wis to see Batista and seb) hin
on @ public relations canpaign which might help hin reestablish his
reputation in the United States. her Bell did not see Batista personally,
but at Firestone did. Wer Bell met with a mimber of Cuban exiles on
varios occasions and becaie convinced that it was not possible to deal with
Batista since the latter insisted on postponing eversthing “until he cones ~

to the States". Firestone arranged to bring Ker Sell into contact with Gen
et

Jose Pedramand separately, Fdiardo Hodriguez, Manuel De Morats nephew, and

very reluctant to go into details, and as the story developed it appeared

to me that he was taking for granted a typical night club story resulting

from loose talk by hivself and the individual called Jones.)

6. ker Eell said he had been virtually o‘fered comand of the Cuban
counter revoluticnary force. He said that he will engage in this only if
CIA backs hin up. He wants to organize a para-nilitary force and -needs 15
to 20 PM experts including conuunicators to train the force. ite also wants
sone specislized equipment such as fire bonbs, radios, and even mentioned
2heF8h aircraft. (Coment: I believe the Dezinicans have been trying to
buy such aircraft for sone time tex fron the Canadian Governnent. The
Canadians, however, have refused at the United States' request to grant
export licenses -for the planes.)

7. Wer Bell wants to see Gen. Cabell or Allen Dulles on this matter.
He says he is willing to act as our agent and believes he can gain the
complete confidence of Pedrazqand De a He said that it te punored in

record through 19h5 and he appears to be a responsible citizen as of that

time. The inpression that I got of hin last might is that he is now a typical

proncter type of the igsf successful vartety found in Latin snerica, proneff
to exagrerated ideas end somewhat naive,ss evidenced by his story of the
1,090 Germans. I carefully avoidea the question of what he stands to

gain by atl of this, but ae the story cae it becomes rather obvious
that he is seeking to act as a broker Fe CIA sypport sa Pedrazaand probably
anticipates collecting hig brokerage fees in terns of public relations con-
tracts xxix from the Dominicans and the new Cuban Government. It is aiso
obvious that Subject has good access to intelligence which may be of consid-
erable velue, particularly if iv becomes necessary to initiate political

action operations apainst the CASTKO Covernment. {.27


9. I recomend that we consider utilizing him as an FI Agent with
a very clear understanding that ve are debe re his motives: st this tines
thet ve vill not support Pedrazaand his proup} nor will the United States
fail to observe its international obligations on behalf of Pedrazg; and with

‘a clear understanding of the linite of our relationships with Subject. I
delieve this man will require firm handling amxkmx if ve propose to use hia,

or we may have considerable trouble with him. We have had information
already on the SedrazAaffair, mich of which confirms the information supplied

by Subject, 0 that we are not without other assets on this natter,
