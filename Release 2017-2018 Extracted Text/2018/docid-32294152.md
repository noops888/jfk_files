TP 92-218

relative to alleged members and all past activities.

In 1956

Florida, a local Hillsborough County Grand Jury investi-

Eation of the Maria resulted in the Grand Jury's concluding that

Gat A128

there is no national or local Mafia in Tampa; however, on

October 15, 1963 in Washington, D. C. before the U. S. Senate

former Chief of

Tampa believed the Mafia was identical with La Cosa Nostra as

described by witness JOSEPH VALACHI.

In view of the above, this report is submitted consisting

of alleged members of the old Mafia in Tampa, Florida.

It is to be noted that cases are open in the Tampa Office

on all individuals cited in this report as members of the Mafia.

The individual cases opened on alleged members as set

forth in this report are to determine their background, current

activities, and establish their prominence and/or association in

La Cosa Nostra so that the Tampa overall investigative responsi-

bility in this captioned organization can be met.

It is further noted for the information of the New York

Division that it is generally understood in law enforcemeht that

the SANTO TRAFFICANTE "family" encompasses all those in the Tampa

area, however, attempts continue to ascertain the existence of

individual "families."

JOSEPH WARD, 4620 Kensington Avenue, both Tampa,
