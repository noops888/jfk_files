TP 92-218

relative to alleged members and all past activities, In 1956

in Tampa, Florida, a local Hillsborough County Grand Jury investi-
gation of the Mafia resulted in the Grand Jury's concluding that
there is no national or local Mafia in Tampa; however, on

October 15, 1963 in Washington, D. C. before the U, S, Senate
Subcommittee Investigating Organized Crime, former Chief of
Police NEIL G. BROWN, Tampa, testified that law enforcement in
Tampa believed the Mafia was identical with La Cosa Nostra as
described by witness JOSEPH VALACHI.

In view of the above, this report is submitted consisting
of alleged members of the old Mafia in Tampa, Florida,

It is to be noted that casesare open in the Tampa Office
on all individuals cited in this report as members of the Mafia.

The individual cases opened on alleged members as set
forth in this report are to determine their background, current
activities, and establish their prominence and/or association in
La Cosa Nostra so that the Tampa overall investigatise responsi-
bility in this captioned organization can be met.

It is further noted for the information of the New York
Division that it is generally understood in law enforcement that
the SANTO TRAFFICANTE "family" encompasses all those in the Tampa
area, however, attempts continue to ascertain the existence of
individual "families,"
