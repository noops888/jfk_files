MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: (S) Destruction of Surveillance Tapes

1.

(S) There has been a long standing interest in locating
the surveillance tapes that would have existed during the
period that Oswald visited Mexico City. A thorough
search has been conducted of the DO’s record system as
well as the index to the retired records in an attempt to
locate the tapes in question. We have discussed this
with operational experts and the professional opinion is
that it is most likely these tapes were never captured
and returned to Headquarters for retention. The normal
practice is to reuse the tapes and only save the
transcripts that are made from the tapes. The time
before the tapes are reused can be a very short.

Messages between field stations and Headquarters use
operational jargon and shortened sentence structures that
can sometimes allow for misinterpretations. Thus, the
reference to what was being sent to headquarters may not
have intended to refer to the fact that actual tapes were
being sent but rather the information from the tapes.

(S) In our search efforts we did locate tapes that were
captured for the immediate time following the
assassination. The fact that these tapes were captured
and returned could allow for the fact that a few people
recall that some tapes existed.

(U) Based upon the search efforts that were undertaken
and the opinions of the operational experts, I have
concluded that the tapes do not exist and were recycled
under the normal course of business before any potential
interest in them was identified.
