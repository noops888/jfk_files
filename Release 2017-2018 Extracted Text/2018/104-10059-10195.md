Who was the unidentified man at a meeting with Richard Helms
on 12’ March 1964 who would have known if Oswald had been a -.

CIA informant?

Answer:

: The unidentified man who accompanied Mr. Helms to the 12 March
1964 meeting was Mr. David E. Murphy, then Chief of the Soviet
Russia Division, DDP. See paragraph 6 of the Tab 9 memorandum
of record of this meeting for Mr. Helma* reported remark that
he ana Mr. Murphy were the two Clandestine Services officers
who certainly would know whether or not Oswald had been an

agent for CIA in the Soviet Union.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. “Unilateral, Coverage: ee

From the time the. Mexico Station was opened jn fiprit- 1947] 7] untit.-

estiinaee,

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had
- developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, ‘a mobile surveillance team and.a_
mail intercept operation. 2 ; yy :
Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by fan employee a the ocal
telephone companyf who was handled by a Station case officer. The number
. of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post -
‘nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Nexican= :
American recruited agents. : :
Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer
assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices.- These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC :
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

“Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double Taned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis. in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

_ tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was

» being released by the Warren Commission... LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located Jin an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The i

purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film.from the .
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then ‘dee
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. -LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early rect due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The ‘team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of - a

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs: for
identification purposes. :

The Station also conducted a [unilateral] mail intercept operation,

~ the nature of the [Mexican services| at that time. . The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), frith which we conducted Vaison was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. Their agents were nee Teele and corrupt. fA Station
officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. . In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

. Army officers.\ In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals,\ the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

“post, and in picking up the transcripts and ‘the tapes. . There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage: See

taps. The Mexicans \soon thereafter connected, five Cuban lines, five

_ Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries Ona

- conversations of interest. which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

:was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian -

ey a Tanguage other than spanish or English were taken to another location i
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the. translations
usually ran about a week behind ‘the date of a conversation.

As soon as the Station ‘learned that an American identifying him 7

self as Lee Oswald _Phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of _

" Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week =
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the -
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll Of:
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.
The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
photograph all. Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with
foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents
were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage ‘had more sophisticated :
equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-
ficulties. ; i

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post: operators:

from a tap of the Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris



Tarasoff for translation because the caller was trying to speak .in Russian. :

There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the
photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in :

either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.
