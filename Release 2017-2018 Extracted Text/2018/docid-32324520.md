POW ASKS WIFE TO JOIN IN CAMPAIGN FOR WORLD

PEACE

(Confidential)

Mrs:

has recently

received letters from her husband,

JEK Act 6(3)

POW Camp,

Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, which are worthy of note.

In a

letter dated

3 Dec

52, and mailed care

of, The Chinese People's Committee for

World Peace,

requested his wife to join him in his "work in the fight for

world peace". After reiterating the need for world peace, the POW asked his

wife "to sit down

and write 5 letters

supporting or requesting support of world

peace.

Address them

to Senator Tom Connally, President Eisenhower, Paul Robeson,

John

Gates (publisher of the New York Daily Worker), and Howard Fast. You may

address Robeson and Fast care of Masses and Mainstream, 832 Broadway, New York, 3,

N.Y., of which magazine they are contributing editors".

went on to say

"I know that merely as my wife a more than sufficient body of material will present

itself. Express your doubts of the so-called 'benefits' of the Korean war.

Think

of how the Korean people are being systematically destroyed. Think of your

personal suffering in an international light, as the suffering of all the wives

of

men in Korea, Indonesia, Malaya, etc.

And remember who is behind it all. Think

write from the viewpoint of the working class, and I am sure that you will.

bring this project to a successful conclusion asnoon as possible." In closing

his letter,

presented a rather sordid picture of what the world might be

like in the event of another world war.

On 17 May 53, Gpl

in answer to questions she had asked about her

not "playing cards and

letter, Mrs.

has received about 6 letters from her husband,

which

considered

about

average.

The hospitalized POW returnee added,

in closing, "as for him writing articles, I could not say about that.

But I'm

sure if he wrote any they were of his own free will".

(Fourth Army) G2 Comment: (Confidential)

It appears that

nay

have been subjected to an intensive Communist indoctrination program

as a

POW.

As his letter contains elements of the CP line, it is possible he may

have fallen victim to the Indoctrination program.

It is also possible that

may

have found it expedient to cooperate with the Chinese authorities

while not actually believing in their principles.

Whatever the case, The

Chinese People's Committee for World Pease 1s probably using

for

propaganda purposes.

(Negro),

are all well known

American CP members.

The Dally Worker is the official organ of the American

CP and the Masses and Mainstream (now the New Masses) has been cited by the

House Un-American Activities Committee as

a CP front publication.
