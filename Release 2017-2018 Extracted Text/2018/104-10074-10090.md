1. On 27 and 28 February call Fore received from Bill
Cantrell, OPS/ITG, an WH/4/AR, concerning
00-A(S)-322/03435-74.... Cantrell wanted to be sure FBI had

next visit to headquarters and received a fill-in_on subject's
background. %

2, “Subsequently a call was received from Charlotte in
C/WH Division office (x-7350). It was imperative to determine

the exact date of contact with Van Cleave as C/WH, thru

Legislative Counsel, had advised Congress on 7 January 1974

that the Agency had no contact with Van Cleave. Atlanta and

Miami were contacted and date of first contact was.set at 25

January 1974. Both offices were requested to provide a record

of contact with Van Geave. Atlanta had several hours of tape

(from first and second meeting) which Pangburn would have transcribed
and forwarded for the record. Called John Peterson later and

’ advised that WH has asked that tapes also be forwarded to

headquarters for retention.

3. We.were advised that the Congressional inquiry on
Van Cleave resulted from a remark overheard at a cocktail
party - that Van Cleave. had commented that he was working with
CIA under cover. Van Cleave was scheduled as potential witness
of House Internal Security Committee so House had inquired
as to whether his appearance would embarrass the Agency. As
noted, response on 7 January was that Agency had no contact with
Van Cleave.
