INIERNAIIONAL CRITICISH OF CHILEAN JUNIA AND MORE RECENTLY OF

BKHERALD HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATED TO DRAMATIC PROPORTIONS• HOS BELIEVES

EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A

NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS FOR AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SOVIET AND/OR

CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE

USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING

FOLITICAL PRISONERS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF

ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF

POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT

THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COULD

DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. Y

2. THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO.

NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION

PROBABLY BECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH

A NEUTRAL SPONSOR AND SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY. EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS

SHOULD GE INTERESTED IN THE OFFER TO RELEASE IMPORTANT CHILEAN

MOBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS Fir

MEDIA I:: ALLENDE'S CHILE

HIGHLIGHTS

Psych fer

.. Since President Allende's electoral victory in 1970, the Government

propaganda apparatus has mounted a coordinated campaign alainas

the opposition communicationa media focusing on the prestigious

El Mercurio newspaper chain and key opposition radios. The long..

range goal is to create conditione that will ingure Government

control over the media so that an emasculated opposition gill operate

intuitively and through self-centorship within in approved framework:

• The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal

and illegal devices designed to intimidate them.

These devices

include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of

essential Government advertiring revenue, temporary closures,

and Government-fomented Etrikes.

-= Chile's national television - the only country-vide channel - has

become an important propaganda instrument for the Government.

But it is being challenged by a Catholic University channel which is

atternpting to expand its service beyond the Santiago arca.

-- A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition,

lasting more than a year, has taken place at the Papelera, Chile's

only important private newsprint producer, with the company

supported by the opposition media stymying repeated Government

efforts to take over the firm.

The paper company claims that

Government price policies have brought it close to bankruptey.

• Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the opposition media

have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political

situation currently prevailing in Chile, and have become increasingly

effective in exploiting the Government's economic failures and the

growing dissensión within the ruling Marxist coalition.

• Nevertheless, the opposition's economic base that sustains its media

is being slowly undermined as the Government expands its control

over the Chilean economy.

lany opposition media are reportedly

already in difficult financial straits.

The Chilean Communist Party.

seeking to strengthen its voice in the March 1973 Congressional

elections, has already purchased five beleaguered radio stations

(one a former opposition station) in southern Chile.

CONFIDERTIAL

MII.

THE ALLENDE PROCESS - HOW THE MEDIA ARE TREATED

"Allende'e treatment of the opposition media and his utilization of

the pro-Government media offer reverling insight: into the unique

claim that Chile will carry out & Socialiet revolution within the frarne-

work of traditional bourgeois and democratic instilutions without

social cost.

Any Chilean government possesget wide powers that can be employed

'to control and intimidate media opponerts given sufficient will power and

cyniciom to do so, despite the fact that media freedoms in Chile are

twice-guaranteed, both in the 1925 constitution and in a statute of

constitutional guarantees agrood to by Alleride's Popular Unity coalition

and the Christian Democrats. (PDC) as a condition for PDC support for

Allende in the congressional run-off held subsequent to the Presidential

election in September 1970.

What are some of these powers? An; Chilean executive under

provisions of the State Internal Security Law may colablish emergency

zones by decrec hended by military commanders empowering the State

" A baoic organizational lechnique for the UP conlition has been the

- establishment of UP cominittees (CUP -- Comilé de Unidad Popular) -=

composed of newsmen who are militant meinbers of parties belonging

to the Government coalition or independent supporters of UP policies -

in newspapere, radios, magazines, and in journalistic bodies.

The

CUp's have been most active at the union level: demanding exorbilant

wage incrcades, insisting that UP employecs be given the right to

express their opinion on editorin pages, disrupting legitimate union

meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company dali to

the leftiat press and to the Government.

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding frecdom of

the press was most explicitly and recalingly stated by the organizing

committee for a conference of leftist journalints which was held in

Santiago in April 1971.

The committee issued the following statement

prior to the conference:

... we believe that we must fight for true freedom of

the press, which will only be posoible when there is

true economic independence. We maintain that Chile

will have true frcedom of the preos only when the means

of mass communication are part of the area of encial

property. that is, (when they) belong to all Chileans:

The press, radio, television, and the theater must be

tools at the service of liberation and culture of our

people and not a private business, an ideological

sattering ran of the national and forcign minority

(the capitalists) as is presently the case. ? (under-

lining added)

Another statement said "the mission of journalists is to support in

defend the People's Government (the UP) together with all the workers."

The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen lor

"Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism, "

and threw a bouquer at Cuba's Prensa Latina agency for its "objective"

reporting of the Chilean phenomenon.

Allende himacli lent legitimacy

to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conference

when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act as the "ranguard"

of the revolution by "elevaring the political level of the people.

Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende

asserted that his Government would respect frecdom of information

while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessive

tolerance" for the opposition media.

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stations must rest

with "bourgeois" radio owners. Long before Allende became president

the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio sintiond

made it a practice to hire leftist commentators because they beliered

that leftiste were superior professionals agd helped to increase

listenership. When the UP came to power it tapped an existing source

of manpower.

In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations

to gain its ends. Radio concessiona are granted by a Gorernment

entity (Servicios Electricos) attached to the Interior Yjnistry.

The

same entity can cancel or transfer such concessions.

Regulations

promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal

disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the

rules, control, and censorship that the Government may adopt."

Under this type of emergency regulation, all radio stations were

placed under an obligatory Government networi -- not an unusual

practice for the Allende Government -- when a modified martial

PDC-oriented Radios Balaceda and Cooperativi, however, have

to date successfully resisted Government enticements and pressures

radio station

which over the yeare had carned a reputation for objec-

radio field. It has suffered more temporary closures than any radio

facility.

The station was shut down, for example, 17 hours in

June 1971 for broadcasting an alleged "alarmist" report during the

State of Emergency decreed after the asanssination of Perca Zujovic,

a former interior minister in the

Frei Government. At the same

time a UP station, Portales, received nothing more than an admoni

Balmaceda was shut down on three separate occasions under

Valparaíso; and 4) the University of Chily channel in Santiago.

The Government clearly recognizes television's importance as

a propaganda chicle, and under the direction ni an allende

confidante, newsman Augusto Olivares (Socialist and a suspected.

member of the ultra-left MIR - Movement of the Revolutionary

private producers went out oi business, squeezed by rising production

coate and discriminatory tas and exchange rate treatment that denied

them needed equipment and spare parts irom abroad. Chile Films

signed a comprehensive exchange accord in March 1971 with the Cuban

Cinematographic Institute (ICAIC) (See Section V. C. Exchange of

Persono, Visitors, and Exchange Agreements).

institute (leitist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the

ment information office,

"develop the new Chilean film industry."

Its products are intended lo glorify the roles of workers, peasants,

and students in the march to Chilean-style Socialism, romanticize the

proletarian role oí the Chilear Communist ard Socialist Parties, and

attack the "bourgeoisie" and their "imperialist" allies. Despite an

intense publicity buildup, however, few films actually appeared in

be pieced together from newsreel film taken during the Allende

The Compañla "lanufacturera de Papeles Y Cartones (known as

the Papelera), Chile's major privale producer cé

crusprint, became

another propagarda balleground cast by the opposition in terms of

"freedom versus d'arxiat totalitarianism.".

In October 1971, the Government, carrying out i long-standing

pledge, announced thät CORFO (the Government Decelopment

Corporation) had opened négotiations to buy out the Papolera through

the purchase of its stock.

The opposition media iminediately launched

a campaign to warn the public that the free press would be crippled

if newsprint distribution were placed at the merc; o! Government

suppliers. At the same time, the opposition media pleaded with

private shareholders to refuse to sell to the Goverament. In addition,

a "freedom fund" was created chabling private persons to buy up

Papelera shares so prevent the company from falling into Government

hands.

For several months pro- and anti-Governmer media carried out

daily an intensive propaganda battle in advertisemeris, news stories,

and editorials.

Both sides resorted to the familiar cumbers game:

the pro-Allende media claimed that the Government was besieged by

willing shareholders eager to sell out: the opposition asserted that

shareholders were resisting temptation. Goverr=er propagandists

argued that newsprint production was essential to the State and must

be controlled by the Siate; the opposition said Pacelera must remain

in private hands as á patriotic duty.

Thwarted to date in its attemp! lo buy out Pagelera sharcholders,

alization of copper, acceieration of agrarian reform,

and reduction of Chile's dependencia on the United

States. One way, then, for Allende to achieve his

acknowledged goal of majority support for the

transition to socialism would have been to try to

arrive at an understanding with the Christian Demo-

crats on the points in his program with which they

were in agreement. This might have prövoked the.

secession of some of the rightist members of the

PDC, but If an accord had been reached with the

party's leaders, it would likely have given Allende

a majority in the Congress for at least part of his

program.

Flushed with victory and unwilling to come to

terms with the party which he had termed "the new

face of reaction" during the campaign, Allende chose

an alternative strategy. The next congressional elec-

tions were not scheduled to take place until March

1973, but the Chilean Constitution provided that in

the event of a conflict with the Congress over the

text of a constitutional amendment, the President

could call a national plebiscite. The strategic course.

adopted by Allende was to attempt to expand popu-

lar support for his coalition and then propose a

constitutional amendment which, in accordance with

the. Popular Unity electoral program, would replace

the existing bicameral legislature with a unicameral

government as a result of high international prices

for copper, Chile's principal export.)

The strategy also contained a Marxise element-

accentuation of the class struggle. At the sare time

that appeals were made to the pocketbeoks of the

lower-class Chileans, there was also to be an effort

to increase their class consciousness (concienti.

zacion) through government publications and the

use: of the media to remove the elements of "false

consciousness" instilled by "bourgeois" propaganda.

Expressing the diametric opposite of a claim often

voiced by his predecessor, Eduardo Frei, Allende

said in a press conference just after his installation,

"I am not president of all Chileans"" And in his first

"Slate of the Nation" mescage to the Congress he

asserted:

•'.. the People's Government (Gobierno Popular) is

Insplred in its policy by a premise that le artificially

denied by some-the eristence of classes and social

sectors with antagonistic and opposing interests.'

Allende's economic advisers anticipated an addi:

tional source of revenue for the government from

the "exploitative" profits of the industrier that were

to be nationalized by the new zovernment. The par.

tially American-owned copper mines were to be

taken over by a constitutional amendment-t.oth lo

lay to rest any legal doubts about the reversal of

the Frei Chileanization agreements of 1967 and

1969, and because a general consensus in Chile

favored nationalization. Other companies were to

be nationalized after a controlling interest nas gained

through the purchase of shares on the open markgt

by the government development agency. The latter

course seemed facilitated by the fact that the price

of shares had been depressed since the elections,

and further economic pressures could be crested

by allowing wage increases but forbidding any rise

In prices. The legal adviser to the government,

Eduardo Novoa, also outlined other "legal loopholes"

in existing Chilean las which could be used for

"gemporary" takeovers

or companies,

including

"intervention" because of labor disputes and "requi-

sition because of a "breakdown in supply of an

article of prime necessity.".

of the Allende coalition had been predicting all along.

Initial Success

Al the outset, the new economic policy was

astoundingly successtul, although it had

the secus of future disaster. Income redistribution

stimulated demand, while price controls and an arti.

ficially low exchange rate kept prices down. As a

consequence, a mini-boom ensued. By March 1971

the Sociodad de Fomente Fabril (Asscciation for the

Manufacturing),

Chllean business and industry, admitted that produc-

tion had Increased by 6.3 percent over the figure

of 12 months before, and by. May that figure had

reached 13.5 percent. The Institute of Economics

of the University of Chile later reported that uncim.

ployment In the Santiago area dropped from 8.3

percent in December 1970 to 5.2 percent in June

1971 and declined further to an unusually low 3.8

percent by the end of the year. The Consumer Price

Index stopped climbing entirely in December 1970

and had only increased by 6 percent by the time

ol the municipal elections of April 1971-its lowest

rise in many years. At the same time, salaries and

wages inereased by 27 percent in real terms.

This wave of economie prosperity-combined

with the absence of the political repression that

some rightists had predicted would result from a

victory by the Marxists-led many, particularly in

low Income groups, to vote for the candidates of the

Popular Unity coalition in the April municipal elec-

lions. Allende's own Socialist Party bettered its elec-

toral showing in the 1969 congressional elections by

nearly 100 percent (a jump from 12 percent to 22

percent of the total), and the candidates of all the

parties supporting Allende received about 50 per-

cent of the vote, as compared with the 36 percent

which the President himself had received only seven

months before. Yet, gratifying as the results were,

leadership which was not committed to either of the

party's wings, and the short run economic and politi.

cal indicators were favorable. Yet, instead of taking

action on the econonic front lo siem the loss of

foreign reserves and to dampen inflationary pres-

sures-and on the political front to prevent the

movement of the Christian Democrats into an alli-

ance with the right-wing opposition parties-the

regime continued its previous policies, confidently

assuming that in the long run "the people" would

support it and ignoring the warnings of "bourgeois"

economists that the loss of foreign reserves, the ex-

pansion of. demand, and the sharp decline in invest-

ment would produce disastrous consequences in the

following year.

Political Polarization

The hardening of the Christion Democratic posi-

tion began in mid-1971. It was accelerated in June

by the assassination of the former Christian Demo-

cratic Interior Minister, Edmundo Perez Zujovic, by

extremists, at least one of whom had been released

from prison by Allende upon his accession to power.

A month later in a by-election in Valparalso, the

victorious Christian Democratic candidate received

the support of the Right. The tacit alliance with the

Right led to the secession from the PDC of eight

deputies and a number of other party leaders to form

the pro-Allende liquierda Cristiana (Christian Left).

This was counterbalanced however, by a split in the

other direction within the Allende coalition. Five of

the seven Radical senators (including two former

presidential candidates) and 7 of the 19 deputies

left the Radical Party (PR), and formed the Partido

de la Izquierda Radical (Party of the Radical Left-

PIR) in protest against the Marxist orientation of a

PR policy resolution which the dissidents described

as "completely removed from the characteristic and

"the interest of the middle social strata" whom the.

party had always represented.* For a lime, the PIR

continued lo support the Allende government, but

within a year it had entered the ranks of the opposi-

tion.

In July 1971, the Christian Democrats had voted

In favor of the constitutional amendment national-

izing the copper mines, but from that point forward,

the pattern was óne of polarization of Chilean politics

and society into two opposing blocks. The Allende

forces controlled the executive and pursued an in-

creasingly vigorous ideological purge of those who

were not entirely sympathetic to the government.

The opposition controlled the legislature, and in

October 1971. the Christian Democrats and the

rightist parties attempted to assert legislative con-

trol over the expansion of the public secfor by voting

in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the

use of the intervention and requisition procedures

and requiring that all transfers of private enterprises

to the "social"' or mixed sectors be carried out in

accordance with specific legislation adopted by the

Congress. This legislative act, referred to as an

amendment on the "Three. Areas of Property," be-

came the focus of a continuing deadlock between

the President and Congress that lasted until

Allende's overthrow in September 1973.

Allende's refusal to accept the amendment or to

call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the

Congress appeared to the congressional opposition

to be a decisive indication of his determination to

bypass the legislature in carrying out the Popular

Unity program, and from the time of the adoption of

the amendment onward, the Christian Democrats

began to cooperate with the rightist parties in. op-

posing the executive. One method was to impeach

ministers for violation or (more often) nonenforce-

ment of the law. The first of many such impeach.

ments took place in January 1972. Another method

was to present a united electoral front against the

government.

Informal cooperation between

the

rightist parties and the Christian Democrals led to

striking victories in two by-elections in January 1972,

and a month later these groups formed the Demo

cratic Confederation (Contederación Democrática

CODE) to prepare joint lists for the 1973 congres-

sional elections. A third area of cooperation was in

the most ferous of which was the March of Empty

Those shortages had developed because the pre-

from

the

Vuskovic policy began to emerge in late 1071: The

balance-of-ga/ments surplus had been depleted at

such an alarming rate (in 1971 there was a deficit

of $315 milion, while in 1970 there had been a

surplus of 391 million) that in November 1971 ine

of the revolt and demanded the lifting of the con-

gressional immunity of the first two, who sat respec-

Two days before the September coup, Altamirano

admitted that he had encouraged navymen to resist

The resignation of what appeared to be the last

all three services were opposed to the President. 1g

coincided with the adoption on the same day of a

"sense of the house" (acuerdo) resolution by the

Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and

the military ministers, drawing their attention to

"the serious breakdown of the constitutional and

legal order." * The resolution criticized the Allende

fovernment for repestedly bypassing the legislature

through the use of legal loopholes and for refusing

to promulgate the constitutional reforms voed by

the Congress. It accused Allende of ignoring judicial

orders, encouraging iliegal seizure of property, perse.

cuting opposition labor groups,

and supporting

illegal paramilitary organizations. In conclusion, it

stated that the listed actions constituted a "serious

breakdown of the constitutional and legal order of

the Republic" and urged the military ministers to

the support of the Christion Democrats. Yut its efféct

He replied to the motion by accusing tie Congress

of "promoting a coup d'ülit by askin: inc military

the Constitution the only way that the Congress.

The congressional vote was echocd by several

were circulated in Santiago. The Lawyers' Association

malevolent intention" to the President-asserted an

within which he ls supposed to exercise his office.

and the actions which he feels oblined to carry out

to be Incapacitated (impedido) in the exercise of his

functions as he understands them," the statement

suerested that he could be removed from office

under Article 43 of the Constitution, which autlior.

The Coup

Exactly when the decision to carry out the coup

had been characterized for nearly a century by a

chronic tendency to inflation, and successive govern.

The immediate causes of the mititary intervention

are apparent from the preceding account. In the last

part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean

politics by both sides and became as polarized as

the rest of Chilean socicly with the overwhelming

majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-

To take just two eximples: copper and milk.

Expropriation of the copper mines fron their

Amerivan owners would, no doube, have led in

itself to the wichdrawal of American rechnicians

as well as of American management with some

consequent risk of losing production umporarly, •

the promotion of trained Chilean managers and

sOn-in-law. The existence of such a group at the

very centre of lbe State was Dol merely a pio

vocation to the established security forces and an

affront to Chilean tradition, ir was also an implied

rejection of the principle of consuirutional rule.

DOUBTs AboUT the real depth of Allende's cob

history and his languag, both of which russessed

a roinentic alachracal lo riolenie.

These were vot the actioas or the sentimcots of a

• But as a strategise, a thinker, a man will a real

messase, he was unconvincing. Towards the end,

as he appeared with increasing frequency oa 1be

IN arTROsPIcy, I am inclined to tunk this was

always tho truck of the matter with Allende.

Basically, he was a political romantic, dealing in

scasations rather than sense. He enjoyed his bour

•upon the stage but he never properly assersed

_the forces he was dealing with, either for or :

açainst him. He raised expectations on his own

side without commanding the means so satisfy

them, and be encouraged opposicion on the

otber side. by his use of a revolutiorary rbetoric

whose threats he also could not iulil.

At best he was muddle-headed; and lime may

show that he was deliberately deceitiul. Certaialy

be managed to deceive a los of people, including

himself. But in the end reality taught its own, hard

lessons. That you can's be, a dignocrat and a

revolutionary at lease, not in a soric y that is

alseady adminedly democratic That you can't

be anti-American and especs the Americans to

help you. That you can't pose as the people's

kader and kick most people in the teeih. That

you can't conscript soldiers into politics and

expect them to renain apolitical. That you can't

have infation roaring out of sight crud maintain a

base for social welfure. That, in short, the real

world is nor Cloud-suckoo-and. Dunz bere,

you just can's have your cake ta ear il

It is sad that such elementary lessons should

have to be laught yet again at sush tragic cost in

• Chile. But it is alaring that so many peoplo

elsewhere should evidently fall to grasp that they

are the lessons.

NETHERLINDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLAIDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Suitoria pril 1974 eugenhuysent Reformatorisch Daeblad,

Dutch, 19 April 1974, p

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be

having adjustment problems.

These rather prolonged

symptoms

seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they

still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of

their harxist president. is

definitely over and that their

country is now being ruled by a small

group of reactionaries

who are trying to keep the

people under control through

terrorism, repression, and torture.

you quite a ways

quick to take advantage of it.

de vantage of her and and those 1g

Such problens will take

lietherlands and those idealists were

"elfare

What is the situation? Most of the approximately

250 refugees with a high school or university education do

not work.

About half of them have been housed at the

"Huis

ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on

the terrace or play volleyball in

the yard.

Board and

lodging are free and at the end

of the week they pick up

another 25 guilders pocket money.

In addition they receive

free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and

compensation for each

trip they have to take.

Do you get the

idea that they are better off than

many. old people

in the letherlands?

You are probably right.

because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfares

are being paid from the frozen funds which had been

allocated for development aid

to their fatherland, Chile.

So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.

Congidering that this small proup of pampored exiles

is preaching revolution even here

and with a fult stomach,

it may be useful to point out a few facts.

These are facts

which are well known

in the Ministry in The Mague but for

some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

Facts

The preat majority of the refugees are not even

Chilean

natlonals.

They are natives of

Uruguay®

They came to Chile as a result of illeral and

revolutionary activities in which they had been involved in

these south and Middle American countries, the ultimate

consequences of which they did not wish

to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende

His first action ag

president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to

declare amnesty for all those who "were members of

terrorist

underground organizations," those who during the last months

of. his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank

robbery of self-service

stores,

the theft

of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and

attempted

murder.

The fact that some of those revolutionaries recelved

Chilean diplonatic status was due to Allende's policy of

granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.

These refugees with a high school or higher level education

to have no adjustment problems in Chile.

As a result

they soon found their way to important key positions in the

covernment.

The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in

Chile either, because they

felt protected by a militant

Marxist army.

Some 10,000 revolutionaries,

from all points of the compass, were at their disposal.

Definition

is known for not exare ratablar

a Swiss newspaper which

Dr. Marlo Fuelma,

niversity of freiburg, wrote the following

"The concept

1 political refugee is only of limited value when applied

tọ Chile.

whatever one's attitude toward the military junta

may be, one thing is certains

the chilean rolupers wore not

pursued only because of their ideology,

thoir status, or

their origin.

This is the traditional, humanitarlan dofini

tion for a refuree.

for the most part they are people who,

In their own country, could be legally charged with crimes

which are punishablo

under any Judicial system.

These rofugees carried out activitles In Chilo which

agalnut the constitution.

As a matter of fact, they are

speciallato in violence.

This In why they sought asylum

the foreign embassies

in Santlago and why there are so many

forelenors among them."

PROGRAM PROPOSED. BY AN IMF TEAM WIIICH VISITED CHILE IN LATE 197H.

THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING

INFLATION TO 100% IN 1974. THIS IMF PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE BUT MAY

BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY

CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACCER-

BATING THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING INFLATIO!. ADHERENCE TO THE IMF

PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVED CHILE'S COREDIT RATING, AS HAS THE

SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE WHITED STATES ON CHILE'S

CIVILIAN ADVISERS TO ASSIST THE GOVERUMENT MINISTRIES.

THIS

PHENONENON IS MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND IN

SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. THE IMPORTANCE

OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE

IS WELL KNOWN• THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AN ADVISORY BOARD

DOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WHILE THE MINISTRY OF

HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT-

ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY

AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY

BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS

AFFECTED BY

THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.

22• IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A

LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN

EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KNOUN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IN INTER-

NATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEW CONSTITUTION. BUT THERE

ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCA -

I FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF CHILEAN ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OF RISK

FACTORS INVOLVED IN MAKING INVESTMENTS IN CHILE. PREPARED FOR PASSAGE

TO HERMES BANK PER REF PARA I REQUEST.

A. THE RULING JUNTA IN CHILE IS MOVING AGGRESSIVELY TO

REBUILD THE ECONOMY BY ADOPTING A HARSH AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND IN

STITUTING POLICIES DESIGNED TO RETURN CHILE TO A MARKET ECONOMY.

B. SANTIAGO MOVED QUICKLY AFTER THE COUP TO REMOVE PRICE

CONTROLS ON ALL BUT 30 BASIC COMMODITIES, WHILE THE CENTRAL BANK

EFFECTIVELY DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB

IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON SANTIAGO'S MEAGER FOREIGN EX-

CHANGE RESERVAES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 88%

IN OCTOBER, BRINGING INFLATION TO NEARLY 450% FOR THE FIRST TEN MONTHS

OF THE YEAR. ANTICIPATED PRICE RISES DURING THE REST OF 1973 IS EX-

PECTED TO PUSH INFLATION TO SOME 750% FOR THE YEAR.

EXCHANGE RATES HAS PRACTICALLY. ELIMINATED THE ONCE FLOURISHING BLACK

MARKETS IN COMMODITIES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE. WHILE EXCHANGE RATES

CHANGED AND PRICES ROSE. THE GROWTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS DEEN

SHARPLY CURTAILED, CAUSING A RELATIVE SCARCITY OF LOCAL CURRENCY AND

A LIQUIDITY CRUNCH FOR BUSINESSMEN.

D. THE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS HAS BEEN HEAVY. DESPITE A

HEALTHY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE, WORKING CLASS CONSUMERS ARE

FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THE DAREST NECESSITIES.

AUSTERITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN MANY CASES BY DISMISSALS OF

'RELATIVELY UNPRODUCTIVE AND POLITICALLY SUSPECT EMPLOYEES HIRED

UNDER THE ALLENDE REGIME. AN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM HAS

BEEN ANNOUNCED AND AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM IS UNDER CON-

SIDERATION•

E• THE JUNTA IS ATTEMPTING TO ENLIST PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR

THE AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND BUSINESS IS SHOWING RENEWED CONFIDENCE.

CONSUMERS AND LABOR, HOWEVER, ARE TAKING A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE. NO

ORGANIZED RESISTANCE TO THE JUNTA.OR ITS PROGRAMS HAS MATERIALIZED.

FAILURE FOR THE JUNTA•

F. CHILE STILL FACES LARGE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS DEFICITS

IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974. EVEN IF DEBT-REPAYMENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH

YEARS. WITH A MASSIVE AY BILLION FOREIGN DEOT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S

HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST DE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANCE-OF

PAYMENTS POSITION IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY.

G. HOWEVER, COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED MORE

•THAN 50% ABOVE LAST YEAR'S LEVEL AS A RESULT OF A 9% LENGTHENING OF

THE WORK WEEK AND IMPROVED MINE MANAGEMENT. PRODUCTION WILL PROBABLY

REACH A RECORD 750,000 TONS NEXT YEAR DESPITE CONTINUING SHORTAGES OF

SPARE PARTS AND SERVICEABLE VEHICLES.

H. AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST DRAIN

ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND THE RECOVERY OF. DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IS A

PRIORITY OBJECTIVE OF THE JUNTA. FARM OUTPUT, HOWEVER, IS NOT EX-

PECTED TO FULLY RECOVER UNTIL THE 1974/75 HARVEST SINCE MOST CROPS

ALREADY ARE PLANTED AND ARE WELL INTO THEIR GROWING SEASONS. THUSI

CHILE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPORT GRAIN IN LARGE QUANTITIES DURING 1974.

OF RAW MATERIALS AND SPARE PARTS MUST BE SOLVED TO BOOST PRODUCTION

QUICKLY: LONG RUN GROWTH WILL DEPEND HEAVILY ON CHILE'S ABILITY TO

INVESTMENT WILL DEPEND ON THE JUNTA'S ASILITY TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD

WELLAS

FAITH IN THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EQUITY AS THEIR ABILITY TO INSTILL IR

CONFIDENCE IN CHILE'S PROSPECTS FOR STABLE RECOVERY AND GROWTH. A

CRITICAL FIRST STEP IS TIMELY SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING COMPENSEATION

CLAIMS EMANATING FROM THE ALLENDE NATIONALIZATIONS. THE JUNTA HAS

•STATED THAT IT WILL EITHER RETURN INTERVENED FIRMS TO THE PRIVATE

SECTOR OR. AS IN THE CASE OF THE LARGE COPPER MINES, ADEQUATELY

COMPENSATE THE PREVIOUS OWNERS. SOME 90 FIRMS ARE ALREADY IN THE

PROCESS OF REVERSION.

J. THUS FAR THE JUNTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN LINING UP SUF-

FICIENT FOREIGN CREDITS TO ENABLE IT TO PURCHASE ESSENTIAL CAPITAL

GOODS AND FINANCE THE CURRENT PAYMENTS GAP. IN ADDITION. THERE ARE

Y A SALVAR À CHILE DEL ANIQUILAMIENTO POLITICO, SOCIAL. Y ECONOMICO:

SE ABREN AHORA PERSPECTIVAS DE RECUPERACION MED:ANTE UN

INTENSO Y DISCIPLINADO ESFUERZO QUE RESTABLEZCA EL HABITO. DEL

TRABAJO, NORMALICE LAS FAENAS, DETENGA LA DESTRUCCION DEL PATRIMONIO

NACIONAL: Y REINICIE EL PROCESO DE CAPITALIZACION INDISPENSABLE

AL FUTURO BIENESTAR.

CON :NVEGABLE SACRIFICIO Y ABNEGATION, LAS FUERZAS

ARMADAS MAS CUMPLIDO SU PAPEL DE SALVAGUARDIA ULPIMA DE LA

INSTITUCIONALIDAD, PERO LA DURA TAREÀ QUE IMPONE RESTANAR LAS

HERIDAS Y REANUDAR LA MARCHA DE LA NACION EXIGE EL APOYO RESUELTO

DE AQUELLA MAYORIZ CUIDADANA QUE, EN TODOS LOS CONOS, HA PEDIDO

UNA MONDA SECTIFICACION:

EL QUEGRANTAMIENTO CONSTITUCIONAL PROVOCADO POR EL MARXISMO

NO PUDO SOLDARSE CON LAS SOLAS INICIATIVAS DE LOS PARTIDOS

POLITICOS. LAS FUERZAS ARMADAS Y CARABINEROS NO DESEABAN NI

HAD DESEADO NUNCA TOMAR SOBRE SI LA RESPONSIBILIDAD DE CONDUCIR

LOS DESTINOS DE LA NACIONA PERO EL CRAMATICO FRAÇASO DE LA UNIDAD

POPULAR Y LAS LIMITACIONES DEL CUADRO POLITICO OPOSITOR PARA

CONSEGUIR EL INDISPENSAGLE CAMBIO DE RUMBO FORZARON LA SITUACION

HASTA EL PUN°C EN QUE SE ENCUENTRA:
