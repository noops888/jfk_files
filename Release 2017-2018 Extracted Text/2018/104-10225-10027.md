EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A

CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE painters
USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUNPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING ger
POLITICAL PRISONCRS1 THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF
ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF

THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COUBLD
DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. ¥

@- THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO
NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION,

PROBABLY BECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH

A basic organizational technique for the UP coalition has been the
establishment of UP cominittees (CUP -- Com de Unidad Popular) --
composed of, newsmen who are militant meme parties belongit
to the Government coalition or independent nupporters of UP policies ~~
in newspapers, radios, magazines, and in journalistic bodies, The
CUP's have been most active at the union level: demanding exorbitant
wage increases, insisting that UP employees Le given the right to
express theit opinion on editorial pages, disrupting legitimate union
meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company dati to
the leftist press and to the Government.

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding freedom of
the press wae most explicitly and revealingly stated by the organizing
committee for a conference of leftist journalinta which was held in
Santiago in April 1971, The committee issued the following statement
prior to the conference: Ee

...we believe that we must fight for true freedom of
the press, which will only be possible when there is
true economic independence. We maintain that Chile
will have true freedom of the preso only when the means
of mass communication are part of the area of social
Property, that 19, (when they) belong to all Chileans, .
The press, radio, television, and the theater must be
tools at the-service of liberation and culture of our
people and not a private business, an ideological
battering ram of te national and foreign minority
(the capitalists) as is presently the case,” (under-
lining added) {

Another statement said "the mission of journalists is to support and
defend the People's Government (the UP) together with ali the workers,
The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen for
"Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism,
and threw a bouquet at Cuba's Prensa Latina agency for its “objective”
reporting of the Chilean phenomenon, Allende himself lent legitimacy
to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conference
when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act ao the "vanguard!
of the revolution by “elevating the political level of the people.
Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende
asserted that his Government would respect freedom of information
while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessive
tolerance" for the opposition media.

On numerous occasions the paper haa been implicated along with
other opposition media in alleged seditious plots carried out in co.

Advertisers have been "requested" not ta.do business with the
chain, “which has been accused of forcign exchange irregularities by
tax authorities, by Government supporters on the paper's own stafi, and
by Allende himself at public rallies, Allende, too, periodically reacts”
to critical Mercurio editorials with charges that Chile and the

Radio continues to be the most important medium of communication
in Chile. The latest available figures compiled by the World Radio-TV
Handbook give Chile a total of 137 stations, including 29 in the capital
City. Santiago (See Table 3), The humber of receivers is estimated at
3 million,’ or one for every third person, Ina country 2600 miles long

designed to intimidate epposition radio stations: requests by Allende
advisers that opposition stations hire designated leftist commentators;
threats of violence: favoritism in the distribution of needed government

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stations must rest
with "bourgevis" radio owners, Long before Allende became president
the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio Stations
made it a practice to hire leftist commentators because they believed
that leftists were superior professionals agd helped to increase
listenership, When the UP came to power it tapped an cxisting source
of manpower.

In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations
to gain its ends, Radio concessions are granted by a Government
entity (Servicios Electricos) attached to,the Interior Mjnistry, The
same entity can cancel or transfer such concessions. ° Regulations
promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal
disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the
rules, control, and censorship that the Government may adopt."
Under this type of emergency regulation, all radio stations were
placed under an obligatory Government network -- not an unusual
Practice for the Allende Government -- when a modified martial
law was decreed in 21 of Chile's 25 provinces during. the October-

authorizes the Central Bank to control the importation of equipment

The Government moved quickly after the 1970 precidential
election to obtain control of key etations, The Socialivt Tarty
gained control of | Portales, Chile's most populie station,
and purchased Radio Corporacion from El Mercurio (Portales han
subsequently ufipped in popularity), The Commninine Party purchased
Magallence, an important Santiago atation, The Cornmunist Party
recently also purchased Radio Simén Bolfvar (formerly pro-~
opposition) in ConcepcidnGie well av four other stations in southern
Chile in preparation for the Conpreasional elections in March 1973),

consortiums, and the most po erful political parties capable of

radio field. It haa suffered more temporary closures than any radio
facility. The station was shut down, for'example, 17 hours
June 1971 for broadcasting an alleged "alarmist" report during the
State of Emergency decreed after the asaasaination of Peres Zujovic,
a former interior minister in the Frei Government. At the same
time a UP station, Portales, received nothing more than an admoni=
tion for transmitting "alarmist" news more acceptable to UP
Propagandists. During the August-September 1971 period Radio
Balmaceda was shut down on three Separate occasions under

In radio as in the press the Government has used CUP
committees to formulate exaggerated waye demania, to
strikes, and to form rump wnions, CUP unions at Radio }
for example, forced the owner to sell out to a cooperati

station gubsequently wan purchased by the Radical Party -- a
member of the UP coalition,

The principal Governinent weapon, however, is ito control
over public service advertizing, which traditionally has provided
the bulk of revenues for Chilean radio stations, The Government
has dangled the prospect of udvertisernents in return for favorable
news treatment, but the bait hao not been picked up by the major
opposition radios which recognize that their independence is at
stake, The economic squeeze makes the future of Chilean
independent radios appear bleak.

Since its inception in Chile in 1962, television has made great
arid, but the medium etill lags behind radio, ially_in the
provinces where technical conditions for viewing are poor, Accord-  ~
ing to the best catimates availablé, there are 350, 000 sets in
Santiago and a total of 500, 000 sets in the country, Chile is’served
by the following television channels: 1) A national network with
some 2i outlets throughout the country; 2) the Catholic, University
channel in Santiago; 3) a separate Catholic University channel in
Valparafao; and 4) the University of Chilg channel in Santiago,

The Government clearly recognizes television's importance as
a propaganda vehicle, and under the direction of an Allende
confidante, newsman Augusto Olivares (Socialist and a suspected.
member of the ultra-teft MIR «- Movement of the Revolutionary
Left), it hae transformed Chile's only nationwide television channel
into an outright political instrument of the Government coalition,
Slanted commentaries favoring UP policies, character assassinations
intended to amear political and class opponents, anda steady drum-~
fire of Socialist propaganda in news and cultural programming
became standard fare. :

E. Films

The Government's film production company, Chile Films, became
the UP's principal propaganda arm in the film field, Rival Chilean
private producers went out of business, squeezed by rising production
coste and discriminatory tax and exchange rate treatment that denied
“them needed equipment and spare parts from abroad. Chile Films
signed a comprehensive exchange accord in March 1971 with the Cuban
Cinematographic Institute (ICAIC) (See Section V. C, Exchange of
Persons, Visitors, and Exchance Agreements),

Chile Films also initiated agreements with the experimental film
inbtitute (leitist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the
Communist-dominated State Technical University (UTE), the Governs
ment information office, the film department of the Communist.
dominated CUT (Central Unica de Trajabadores -- the major labor
organization), the national television network, and the University of
Chile television station. The stated purpose of the accords was to
“develop the new Chilean film industry,"

Its products are intended to glorify the roles of workers, peasants,
and students in the march to Chitean-style Socialism, romanticize the
proletarian role of the Chilean Communist and Socialist Parties, and
attack the "bourgeoisie" and ir “imperialist” allies, Despite an
intense publicity buildup, however, few films actually appeared in
the 1970-72 period, Most of the films that were produced appeared to
be pieced together from newsreel film taken dering the Allende 7
presidential campaign or from post-election political rallies,

C. University Confrontation and Television Freedoms

Growing opposition confidence fed by an election victory at the
University of Chile in April 1972 and dy stitiening opposition
attitudes at Santiago's Catholic University had important spill-over
effects in television programming at two channels run by Catholic
University, Increasing opposition effectiveness even raised the
possibility that the Marxist-controlled University of Chile channel for
the first time in its existence might be obliged to inject some
objectivity into its output,

Hf lorld-attention has moved away from Santlago’

Allende last Septernber, but the questions
that were raised at that time’still need answering.
Where should the primary responsibility. be placed
for the tragic events.-on and after September 11,
1973? Was. it, as the Left contends, the result of a
‘fascist counterrevolution aided and abetied by the
forces of imperialism? Was it, as the Right asserts,
the only available response to Allende’s ‘attempt to
establish the dictatorship of the proletariat by a
mixture of guile:ahd force? Did it mark the “death
of a dream” of the“establishment of socialism by
democratic means, and-was it thereby one more
demonstration that Marxism must use force to ac-
‘complish Its goals? Were there internal.and external
pdlitical and economic factors which made it im-
possible for Allende’s experiment to succeed, or

tion, reflected the fears of non-Marxlst groups that
the new Marxist President would use the consider-
able power of the Chilean executive to undercut and
eventually destroy all opposition ta a Marxist take-
over.

Political and Economic Strategy

When he took office, Allende promised that he
would follow a “second model” of Marxism—the
via’ Chilena to socialism, “with meat pies and red
wine." To prove that this model was “anticipated
by the classics of Marxism,” he quoted from
Friedrich Engeis on the possibility of

Yet it was precisely the.question cf majority sup-

In his coatition-were in a distinct minority in the
Congress, and although there was rio doubt about the
legitimacy of his election by that body, his victory
had only ‘been possible because of the conditional
support of the Christian Democrats. The PDC, it”
should be noted, included both Radomiro Tomic,
the party's..1970 presidential candidate, who had
gone to Allende’'s house to -conpratulate
day after the popular election, clearly inferring his
future support, and conservatives like Senator Juan
‘de. Dios Carmona, who had fought within the party
to prevent it from voting for Allende'in the run-off.
In the Immediate aftermath of the election the POC
was controlled by the Tomic forces, who claimed
to be In favor of “communitarian” socialism, nation:
alization of copper, acceleration of agrarian reform,
and reduction of Chile’s dependencia on the United
States. One way, then, for Allende to achieve his
acknowledged goal of majority support for the
transition to socialism would have been to try to
arrive at an understanding with the Chi
crats on the points in his program with which ‘they
were In agreement. This might have provoked the-
secession of some of the rightist members of the
POC, but if an accord had been reached with the
party's leaders, it would likely have given Allende

the interaction of the various elements of this politi
cal and economic strategy that finally produced the

Initial Success

eee

At the outset, the new economic policy was
astoundingly successful, although it had within it
the seeds of future disaster, Income redistribution
stimulated demand, while price controls and an arti-
ficially tow exchange rate kept prices down, As a
Consequence, a mini-boom ensued. By March 1971
the Sociedad de Fomente Fabril (Asscciation for the
Development of | Manufacturing), representing
Chilean business and industry, admitted that produc-
tion had Increased by 6.3'percent over the figure
of 12 months before, and by May that figure had
feached 13.5 percent. The Institute of Eccnomics
Of the University of Chile later reported that uncm-
ployment in the Santiago area dropped from 8,3
farcent in December 1970 to 5.2 percent in June
1971 and dectined further to an unusually low 3.8
Percent by the end of the year. The Consumer Price
Index stopped climbing entirely in December 1970
and had only increased by 6 percent by the time
of the municipat elections of April 1971—its lowest
tise in many years. At the same time, salaries and
wages increased by 27 percent in reat terms,

This wave of economic prosperity—combined
with the absence of the political repression that
Some rightists had predicted would result from a
Wetory by the Marxists—ted many, particularly in
low Income groups, to vote for the candidates of the
Popular Unity coalition in the April municipal elec.
tions. Allende’s own Socialist Party bettered its elec.
{oral showing in the 1969 congressional elections by
early 100 percent (a jump from 12 percent to 22
Bercent of the total), and the candidates of ali the
barties supporting Allende received about 50 per-
Cent of the vote, as compared with the 36 percent
which the President himscit had received only seven
months before. Yet, gratifying as the results were,

Political Polarization
Pea Sarena
The hardening of the Christian Democratic posi-
tion began in mid-1971. It was accelerated in June
by the assassination of the former Christian Demo-
Cratic Interior Minister, Edmundo Perez Zujovic, by
extremists, at least one of whom had been released
from prison by Allende upon his accession to power.
A month later in a by-election in Valparalso, the
victorious Christian Democratic candidate received
the support of the Right. The tacit alliance with the
Right led'to the secession from the PDC of eight
Geputies and a number of other party leaders to form
the pro-Allende fiquierca Cristiana (Christian Left).
This was counterbaianced however, by a split in the
other direction within the Allende coalition. Five of
the seven Radical senators (including two former
Presidential candidates) and 7 of the 19 deputies
left the Radicat Party (PR), and formed the Partido

creasingly vigorous ideological purge of those who
were not entirely sympathetic to the government.
The opposition controled the legislature, and in
October 1971 .the Christian Democrats and the
rightist parties attempted to assert legisiative con-
trol over the-expansion of the. public sector by voting
im favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the
use of the intervention and reat ition procedures
and requiring that ail transfers of private enterprises
to the “social” or mixed sectors be carried out In
accordance with specific legislation adopted by the
Congress. This legisiative act, zeferred to as an
amendment on the “Three “Aréas'of Property,” be-
came the focus of a continuing deadlock between
the President and Congress that’ lasted - until
Allende’s overthrow in September 1973.

Allende's refusal to accept the amendment or to
call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the
Congress appeared to the congressional opposition
to be a decisive indication of his determination to
bypass the legislature In carrying out the Popular
Unity program, and from the time of the adoption of
the amendment onward, the Christian Democrats.

posing the executive. One method was to impeach
ministers for violation or (more often) nonenforce-
ment of the aw. The first of many such impeach-
ments took place in January 1972. Another method
was to present a united electoral front against the
government. Informal cooperation between the
rightist parties and the Christian Democrats led to
striking victories in two by-elections in January 1972,
and a month iater these groups formed the Demo-
cratic Confederation (Confederacion Democratica—

difficulties in securing loans from the Inter-American
Development Bank, the World Bank and the Esport-

On the political font, there were individuals and.

movement toward polarization, which they correctly
foresaw would load to the breakdown ef Chilean
institutions. Two iniportant efforts to arrive at a com.
promise on the: issue of the constitutional amend-
ment an the “Three Anas of Property" were made in
the first part of 1972, In Aprit the Left Radicals, who
had entered the Allende government in January,
carried on tengthy negotiations with the Christian
Demacrats to hanimer out a satisfactory agreement
‘on this issue, only to have it rajected by the top
command of the Popular Unity coaiition parties. The
Left Radicals responcied by leaving the government
and joining the o;position, a move Aliende described
as "a slab In the back.” " A second set of nenotia-
tions if June between the’ head cf the Christian
Democratic Party and Allende’s Minister of Justice
broke down when the time limit set by the Christian
Demvoctals expired and the POC teasership refused
to extend it.

The two sets of negotiations sezm to have col-
lapsed for related reasons, In Aprit the left wing of
the Popular Unity coalition was unwilling to accept
a compromise which would slow down or stop the
forward movement of the government nationalization
proprain, while in June the right wing of the
Christian Democrats could point to an impending
by-election ir. mid-July as a reason for discontinuing
discussions. Both cases illustrated a general prob-
Jem posed by the Chilean muitipany system. Once
political conflict became po! . the extremes
held the rest of the opposing coalitions hestage and
prevented what could have been a convergence of
views in the center.

to carry out an enlisted men’s revolt on August 11 in
Valparaiso and Concepcién. The announcement
accused PS Secretary General Carlos Altamirano,
MAPU leader Oscar Garreton, and Miguel Enriques,
head of the MIR, of being the “intellectual authors”
of the revolt and demanded the lifting of the con-
gressional immunity of the first two, who sat respec-
tively in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
Two days before the September coup, Altamirano
admitted that he had encouraged navymen to resist
their coup-minded (goipista) officers."

August 17 in protest against nis lack of suffi
power to settle the strine, Allende compeiied him
fo add that his; departure from the cabinet “im
plicitly” carried with it his retirement a3 Air Force
Commander. This was correctly seen as an Allende
tactic to remove an officer oppozed to him, and it
met serious resistance from within the Air Force,
provoking a series of actions which ultimately led
directly to the September 11 coup.

On August 20, top Air Force officers met to'decide
whether to resist Allende’s action. ‘By evening, Ruiz
had persuaded them to accept it on the condition
that Allende appoint the sccond-ranking officer,
General Gustavo Leigh, as Air Force Commander and
name another Air Force genaral to the cabinet (so
that Allende could not repeat the same maneuver
with Leigh). The next night the wives of high-ranking
military officers, including- those of six generals,,
gathered in front of Generat Prats’ house to present
a letter asking for his resignation, When the cemon-
stfrfion was broken up by police tear gas, it pro
voked such dissension in the armed forces that ‘on
the following day General Prats decided to resign
both as Defense Minister and Army Commander. He
was joined by two other generals who, with Prats,
had led the mititary forces that had quelied the
tank-regiment revalt in June.

The resignation of what appearéd to be the last
defenders of Allende in the army now meant that
all three services were opposed to the President. It
coincided with the adoption on the same day of 3
“sense of the house" (acuerdo) resolution by the
Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and
the military ministers, drawing their attention to
“the serious Breakdown of the constitutional and
opal orcer." * The resolution criticized the Allende
fovernment for repeatedly bypassing the legislature
through the use of legal loopholes and for refusing
to promulgate the constitutional reforms voted by
the Congress. It accused Allende of ignoring judicial
orders, encouraging iticgal seizure of property, perse-
cuting opposition labor groups, and supporting
illegal paramilitary organizations, In conclusion, it
stated that the listed actions constituted a “serious
breakdown of the constitutional and legal order of
the Republic” and urged the military ministers to
“put an end to the ‘de facto situations listed abave
which violate the Constitution and the law” or be

Since the coup, comments in the world press
| fepresenting widely divergent political postures have
«ed the Chilean case as proof that the hope of
ehieving Marxist socialism through democratic
means is a vain one. Yet most people have failed. to
reir two fundamental errors of the Allende policy,
ieeither of which was essentially related to the
j MteMpt to establish democratic socialism:

Policy of deliberate class polarization, almed at ex-
panding his electoral base, was more successful In
pitting professional and middle-class groups against
him than jin widening his support among worker
peasants and low-income groups.

2) Mardist economists and policymakers have
always placed primary emphasis on Investment and
the expansion of the productive capacity of the
economy. By contrast, the Allende policymakers
emphasized increases In consumption and cornbined
this with a headlong rush to take over industry'and
agriculture—a course far removed from the “two
steps forward, one step back” of Lenin. The conse-
-quences of these policies after their deceptive Initial
Success were massive government deficits, runaway
inflation, and a neaf-breakdown of the economy,

since, in any event, Allende’s regime managed to
secure enough forelgn credits from Latin American,
European, Soviet and Chinese sources to increase
the Chilean foreign debt from $2.6 billion to $3.4
billion in less than three years. Much of the new
indebtedness was to Western Europe and other Latin
American countries. Surprisingly, Chile's debt to the
USSR, China and Eastern Europe increased only from
$9 million to $40 million between 1970 and
1973.")

Specie aspects of the Chilean system also made
tha Allende experiment a particularly difficult one.
He was able to come to power in the first place
because of Chile’s deeply-rooted commitment to the
democratic system and because the Marxist parties
were able to mobilize’a part of the proletariat and
the peasantry, and he had at his disposal many
Instruments for state control of the economy which
had been developed by previous administrations
since the 1930's. However, he was required to
operate within an institutional’system which included
frequent'and staggered elections, proportional rep-
fesentatiun, and’ a multiparty system which made
majority rule very difficult-and often gave veto pow-
ers-to the extremes of Right.and Left, The economy
had been characterized for ncarly a century by 2
chronic tendency to inflation, and successive govern
ments had consistuatly ignored agriculture in the
interest of securing urban electoral support, The
most important systemic constraint of all, of course
was the existence of a professionalized and insti
tutionally-loyal_ military which was unresponsive to
the ideological blandishments of the Left."

The immediate causes of the military intervention
are apparent from the preceding account. In the last
part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean
politics by both sides and became as polarized as.
the rest of Chilean socicty—with the overwhelming
majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-
flict over education in March-April 1973 height:
ened that polarization just at the time the military
were‘attempting to extricate themselves from politi-
cal Involvement. Then’ the expansion of arms
searches in mid-1973 revealed the extent to which
Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge
‘of civil war, Finaily, the efforts to subvert the existing
military hierarchy by a combination of leftist activ:
ity among entisted men and presidential maneuver-
ing with promotions and retirements provided the
classis scenario for a coup d'état.

‘One Can also relate Alienae’s aithculties to the
inherent contradictions in the Marxist theory to which
ho appealed. At the Same time that he proclaimed
his faith in a democratic, pluralist and libertarian
ransition, to socialism, many of his Marxist-sup-
porters spoke and acted.on the basis of a beliel In
the inevitability of armed confrontation, With his
knowledge, they armed themselves and—whst was
worse—talked incessantly about revolution. The fe-
peated Statements of Régis Debray and others that
tae observance of the rules of “bourgeois” legallty
was-only a tactic until the balance of forces had
improved was hardly likely to persuade doubters of
the sincerity of Allende’s commitinent to democracy: |
When the importation and distribution of arms was
combined with efforts to reorganize education atong
ideological lines, to subvert military discipline, and
to rearrange the hierarchy of command, It Is not
altogether surprising that the military finally took
action.

A positive-evaluation of the Allende years would
certainly credit him with a sincere effort to ralse
the living-standards of low-incomo groups and to
involve them actively In the determination of thelr
‘own future. It would likewise stress the continued
existence of freedom of expression for all points of
view in Chile right up to the coup, A more negative
assessment would ask whether the low-income
groups in Chile genuinely benefited from an eco:
nomic policy. which after the first half of 1972 pro-
duced hyperinflation, a continuous drop in agri.
Cultural and industrial production, and a reduction
in the real value of wages and salaries. Even more
critically, one could inquire who has suffered the
most in economic and in human terms as a result of
tne breakdown of the Chilean system—the Marxist
politicians, many of whom were able to escape oF
0 into exile, or the workers, peasants and slum-
dwellers they claimed to represent, who are now

‘at least. But this might have bea overcome by

the promotion of tained Chilean manar=s and

‘Alas, for Chile's natioual income, Allende pot

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLAND POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Fsitorial by N. van Hs alehan Reformatorisch Dagblad,

Dutch, 19 April 1974, p

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be
having adjustment problems. These rather Prolonged symptoms.
seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of
their Karxist president. is definitely over and that their
country is now being ruled ty a small group of reactionaries
who are trying to keep the people under control through
terrorism, repression, and torture. Such problens will take
you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were
quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

What is the situation? Most of the approximately
259 refugees with a high school or university education do
not. work. About half of them have been housed at the "Huis
ter Schie” in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on
the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. Board and
lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up
another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and
compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they are better off than
many. old people in the hetherlands? You are probably right,
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfares
they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.


Considering that this small proup.of pampered exiles
is preaching revolution even here and with a full stomach,
it may be useful to point out a few facts. These are facts
which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague but for
some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

Facts

The great majority of the refugees are not even pitscssssesads
Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and 7
Uruguay. They came to Chile as a result of illeval and

revolutionary. activities in which they had been involved in

these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate

consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende
showed sympathy for their situation. His first action ag
president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to
declare amnesty for all those who “were members of terrorist
underground orfanizations,” those who during the last months
of his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank
robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft
of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and attempted

murder.

i The fact that some of those revolutionaries received
Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of
granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.
These refugees with a high school or higher level education
seemed to have no adjustment problems in Chile. As a result
they soon found their way to important key positions in the
covernment. i

The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in
Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant
Warxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutionaries,
from all points of the compass, were at their disposal.

Definition

In the Berner Tage latt, a Swiss newspaper which
is known for not exa, rath re Marlo Puelma, from the
University of Freiburg, wrote the followings "The concept

of political refugee is only of limited value when applied
to Chile. Whatever one's attitude toward the military junta


may be, one thing is certains ‘the Chilean refugecs wore not
pursued only because of thelr ideology, their status, or
their origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian defini=
tion for a refuree. For the most part they are people who,
in thefr own country, could be legally charged with crimes
which are punishable under any Judicial system.

These ratugees carried out activities in Chile which
were againut the constitution, As a matter of fact, they are
specialists in violence. This ins why they sought asylum in
the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are so many
foreigners among them."

IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974 EVEN IF DEBT-REPAYNENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH
