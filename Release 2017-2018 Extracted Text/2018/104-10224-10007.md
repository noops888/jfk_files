1. I have been some time getting around to expressing my

appreciation to you and through you to the other officers who

participated in the Senior Seminar. Maybe it is just as well

becausc, as you probably are aware, a number of the findings

of the Senior Seminar have been, in one form or another, acted

upon. In some of the cases, action that was already underway

was accelerated. In othere, the Seminar produced useful insights

on thc basis of which action was taken.

2. I know that it was a considerable labor for you but I

would like you to be aware of the fact that I and the other officers

in the Clandestine Service involved in the matters dealt with by the

Seminar have been helped greatly by its several findings.

3. It la probable that we will want to do another running of

the Seminar later this year.

If so, I know that we will benefit from

ine excellent pilot run which you conducted.

The careero this officer has been notably marked through-

out with relatively important responsibilities for his age. His youth,

intense drive, initiative, self-assurance, capacity for work, natural

talent for determining the objectives, recognizing the problem,

organization of the work to be done, administering and supervising

the effort, have long been evident to those for and with whom he has

worked. Years of service during which he has steadily matured has

resulted in a recognition, by supervisors and subordinate fellow-

workers alike of his unusually wide experience, proven soundness of

judgement, organizational administrative and executive talent coupled

with povers of expression both oral and written and demonstrated

capacity for work. He is unquestionably a very outstanding officer.

3.

Having entered on duty as a Code Clerk (GS-05) in October

943 following an A. B. degree ir. Economics from Dartmouth Colleg

in a Navy V-12 Program, he was soon assigned to

training at Headquarters, he was assigned 1o C

outstanding abilities as a Counter Intelligence officer. He has

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division

SUBJECT:

Recommendation for Pronotion - Newton Scott Miler

from his present erade of seat to ta Seer* aromated

to tho Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present

position of Chief of Station,

_, in September 1961.

He has been in grade since 24 March 1957.

In accepting his

present assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a very com-

plicated operational program requiring considerable reorientation

and modification.

In a short time he has been able to give

purpose and direction to operations which previously had been

the subjcet of considerable controversy within DD/P,

It 1s

worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost

entirely new team,

few of whom had any previous experience in

Africun operations.

2.

Under normal circumstances,

the Supervisor would be

Inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further

opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the

Individual.

It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception

to this rule.

Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division,

Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former supervisor

who is

presently Deputy Chiof, CI-CF Staff.

This man had

apparently felt so sticugly about Miler's performance that he

had suggested that Miler be the one man on the CICE staff who

should be given a jump promotion to supergrade.

If necessary &

memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.

In addition to the above,

the Supervisor has been

assoclated with Miler in a professional relationship since 1940t

me only kap in continuity was from the period 1956 to 1959.

therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler'

knowledge, ability, experience,

potential bears weight.

(1 April 190! - 31 March 1970)

1. During the current raling period Mr. MILER was transferred

from his previous position as Deputy Chier of the Special Intelligence

Group of the Counter Intelligence Staff to the position of Chief of the

Operations Group of the same Staff. This was a new position and as such

required unusual skills and vigor to give dimension to the job to be done.

Mr. MILER approached his task with imagination and energy. He inherited

an incohegive group of capable dificers

and immediately began the task of

trying to define common denominators for their operational activities, to

weed out duplicatory and marginal tasks, to establish clearly delineated

guidelines and to provide i sense of discipline, all aimed toward giving

better counterintelligence guidance and support to the operations of the

arca divisiona and the operational components of the CA Staff.

2.. At the same time Mr. MILER has continued to handle, under

the direct guidance of the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, a number of

extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and

developmentally.

The cases required not only keen operational sense in

their handling,

but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved

frequent high-level discussion and negutiation with other components uf

CIA as well as with outside agencies and departments. In fulfilling these:

responsibilities, Mr. MILER has worked without regard to hours or to hie

personal convenience. He has assiduously tried to reflect the thinking of

the Chief of the CI Staff and to relate it to the operational problems he is.

handling. He has also given mature, insightiul supervision and encourage -

nient to the orientation and development of a Deputy Chief, Operations,

another important innovation in the Staft's organization.

As a member of the Program Review Panel Mr. MILER con-

tributed fully in examining, reviewing and commenting on the progrars

of the operating components within the Clandestine Service. He, together

with other members of the Panel have striven to devise a formula to

give management i clear, concise picture of what we intend to do and

what we are doing and have done to make those intentions reality,

0:51

5. While being able to adjust his own thinking v her and as

required by a given situation, Mr. MILER has strong personal con-

victions on operational matters and does not hesitate to advance his

opinions or to push for his recommended solutions.

6. Mr. MILER is currently directing an office which includes

in its complement one GS-16 and 2l4 GS-15s. He is also responsible

for the career development of kak more junior case officerg. The

above is in addition to the normal supervision of the remaining group

staff. In performing these functions, he is cost-conscious and econo-

mizes in the expenditure of government funds and the valuable time of

senior officers.

7. Mr. MILER would be the first to admit that many problems

remain for him in his current assignment.

He would also rcadily ack-

nowledge that he has not yet been able to clearly define each of these

problems or to provide the perfect solution for every one which has

been isolated. Progress, however, is being made every day and Mr.

MILER clearly demonstrates that his promotion to CS=16 in 1969 was

deserved and that it will not be the last which he will merit. This is

an officer of high professional integrity and dedication. Me is a self-

starter, he works and thinks realistically.

He speaks his mind when

he has something to say - including critical things, yet entains a good

sense for the craftsman's side of the Cl job. He is not adept just at

identifying problems, he finds the solution.

Subject's first assigument as a Chlet of Station and It is Interesting

that he possesses a great deal of natural managerial skill.

In supervising subordinate personnel he has also considerable competence.

Although he has experienced difficulty in the handling of one officer,

there as no evidence that Subject has fallen short of doing his duty.

Morale at his Station Is high.

Reference should be made to Sublect'g

highly developed sonse of integrity and intollectual honesty.

Another

strong and uscful attribute in his innate sense for anticipating possible

Iproblons and to act upon them before they cvolve.

If

there is any weakness in Subject's performance as Chief of Station, 1t

is probably the occasional bolated comunication to Headquarters.

This

Branch considers Itself fortunate to have Subject in his present position

and supports his desire to extend for one year beyond the explation

of his present tour.

Subject's promotion during 1962 1s further evidence

of Headquarters' confidence in him.
