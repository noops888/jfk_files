On the occasion of retirement, it has

in your many years of service. We do appre-
ciate this contribution and wish you the best
of satisfaction and enjoyment in the years
ahead.

appreciation to you and through you to the other officers who
participated in the Senior Seminar. Maybe it is just as well
because, as you probably are aware, a number of the findings
of the Senior Seminar have been, in one form or another, acted
upon. In some of the cases, action that was already underway
was accelerated. In others, the Seminar produced useful insights
on the basis of which action was taken,

2, [know that it was a considerable labor for you but I
would like you to be aware of the fact that [and the other officers
in the Clandestine Service involved in the matters dealt with by the
Seminar have been helped greatly by its several findings.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division
SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion ~- Newton Scott Miler

1, It is recommended that Newton Scott Miler be promoted
from his present grade of GS-14 to GS-15. Miler was assigned
to tho Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present
position of Chief of Station, a | in September 1961.
He has been in grade since 24 March 1957, In accepting his
present assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a very com-
plicated operational program requiring considerable reorientation
and modification. In a short time he has been able to give
purpose and direction to operations which previously had been
the subject of considerable controversy within DD/P, It is
worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost
entirely new team, few of whom had any previous experience in

African operations.

2, Under normal circumstances, the Supervisor would be
inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further
opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the
individual. Yt 4s felt that Miler is a justifiable exception
to this rule, Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division,
Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former Supervisor
who is presently Deputy Chief, CI-CE Staff, This man had
apparently felt so strongly about Miler's performance that he
had snggested that Miler be the one man on the CI-CE staff who
should be given a jump promoticn to supersrade. Jf accessary a
memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.

3. In addition to the above, the Supervisor has been
uysociated with Miler in a professional relationship since 1946,
The only gap in continuity was from the period 1956 to 1959, It
is folt, therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's
knowledge, ability, experience, and potential bears weight,

2, During the two years that he has been an officer of the
Operations Group of the CI Staff Mr. Miler has demonstrated an
exceptional ability to interpret counterinteligence experience and
practice in guiding operations in this area throughout the divisions
of the DD/P, He has applied field experience gained in one area,
combined with expertly informed Headquarters knowledge, to
intricate and sensitive problems affecting U. S, security in a
variety of geographic areas from the Far East to the Western
Hemisphere and Europe with outstanding skill and surcness of
judgment. He is aggressive, devotes long hours uncomplainingly
to his tasks, and willingly contributes his guidance io officers of
less experience. In peroonal relationships throughout the
Clandestine Services he is admired, respected, and well-liked,
His recommendations are eagerly sought and contribute in major
fashion to increased efiectiveness in carrying out the Ci mission,
It is again strongly recommended that he be promoted to GS-15,

MEMORANDUM in Lieu of Fitness Report

SUBJECT: Newton Scott MILER
(i April 1969 ~ 31 March 1970)

1, During the current rating period Mr. MILER was transferred

- from his previous positiun as Deputy Chief of the Special Intelligence

Group of the Counter Intelligence Staff to tae position of Chief of the
Operations Group of the same Staff, This was a new position and as such
required unusual skills and vigor to give dimension to the job to be done.
Mr. MILER approached his task with imagination and energy. He inher ited
an incohesive group of capable officers and immediately began the task of
trying to define common denominators for their operational activities, ‘to
weed out duplicatory and marginal tasks, to establish clearly delineated
guidelines and tu provide a sense of discipline, all aimed toward giving
better countcrintelligence guidance and support to the operations of the
area divisions and the operational components of the CA Staff.

2. At the same time Mr, MILER has continued to handle, under
the direct guidance of the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, a number of
extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and |
developmentally. The cases required not only keen operational sense in:
their handling, but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved
frequent high-level discussion and negotiation with other components of
CIA as well as with outside agencies and departments, In fulfilling these.
responsibilities, Mr. MILER has worked without regard to hours or to his
personal convenience... He has assiduously tried to reflect the thinking of
the Chief of the CI Staff and to relate it to the operational problems he is
handling, He has also given mature, insightiul supervision and encourage-
ment to the orientation and development of a Deputy Chief, Operations,
another important innovation in the Staff's organization.

3. As a member of the Program Review Panel Mr. MILER con-
tributed fully in examining, reviewing and commenting on the programs
of the operating components within the Clandestine Service, He, together;



‘with other members of the Panel have striven to devise a formula to

give management a clear, concise picture of what we intend to do and
what we are doing and have done tu make those intentions reality,

hen and as

5. While being able to adjust his own thinking
required by a given situation, Mr, MILER has strong personal con-
victions on operational matters and does not hesitate to advance his
opinions or to push for his recommended solutions.

6. Mr. MILER is currently directing an office which includes
in its complement one GS-16 and die GS-15s, He is also responsible
for the carcer development of fm more junior case officers. The
above is in addition to the normal supervision of the remaining group
staff, In performing these functions, he is cost-conscious and econo-
mizes in the expenditure of government funds and the valuable time of

senior officers,

7. Mr. MILER would be the first to admit that many problems
remain for him in his current assignment, He would also readily ack-
nowledge that he has not yet been able to clearly define each of these
problems or to provide the perfect solution for every one which has
been isolated. Progress, however, is being made every day and Mr.
MILER clearly demonstrates that his promotion to GSi16 ia 1969 was
deserved and that it will not be the last which he will merit. This ig
an officer of high professional integrity and dedication. He is a self-
starter, he works and thinks realistically. He speaks his mind when
he has something to say - including critical things, yet retains a good
sense for the craftsman's side of the CI job. He is not adept just at
identifying problems, he finds the solution,
