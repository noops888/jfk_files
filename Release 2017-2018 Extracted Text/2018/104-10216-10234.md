MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Test of Open Sight Hood for 7.62un Belgiua (FAL) Rifle

BRYERENCE: A) Memo for Red, dated 25 May 1944, Subject: PaAt.-

je. B) Mewo for Rcd. dated 10 June 1964, Subject: Tests

fi a Of Modified Sights for 7,63 Belgium (FAL) Rifle

On 15 and 16 Jube 19 the undersigned and Mr,
‘T8D/SDB went to to test an open sight hood for
eo 7. Belgium (FAL) developed in answer to Ref. A.

i The Modified Williams peep sight developed previously in answer

i to Ref. A and reported on in Bef. B. proved unsatisfactory to the
H requester, The snap-on sight hood was then developed on a quick
reaction basis to bo simpler to install and easier to use than

/ the Williams sight. In addition sono improved underloaded 7.62m8
HATO rounds having eoft. annealed cases and cream of whest filler
wero tested for performance, These vere Geveloped in hopes of

the erratic conmnision poriorannce, notes. 5a.Ret Pe sveiaprion’

EE 3. Tho open Sight hood snaps over the existing rear sight
of the PAL rifle, and in theory makes shooting in poor light or
Bt Bight easier, It can be used with either standard factory

- loads or the underloaded ammunition in conjunction with the muzzle
‘attachment silencer. The notch on the rear Bight hood is "U" shaped
. and raised to compensate for the moro curving trajectory of the low
velocity ammunition. The hood is easily detached making the con-

ventional peep sight evailable any time it 19 desired,

3. The attached date sheet summarizes the test results, It

Was found that some familiarization vas necessary to get used to

- thé open sight. Under ident conditions the sight vas as eazy to

- Use as the peep sight although it was more difficult to maintain
uniform vertical grouping. The relationship between the eye and

Fear sight was found to be very critical. de the tests proceeded ~

& change vas noted in the point of impact ws. point of aim which was

thought to be due to a change in sight picture on the % cf the

5. Tests were conducted in the evening to determine the degree
of usefulness of the sight in poor light. In this respect a 22
Caliber Hi-Standard pistol with folding shoulder stock and Bushnell
1.3X Phantom scope was tested in comparison, The scope was
@quipped with yellow filters to brighten the sight picture for
: low light level use. It was the opinicn of both test personne)
i +. + that the scope was superior to either the peep sight or open aight
Hy fos as long as their was some illumination on the silhouette
targets. Once the light failed the scope was completely useless
although the undersigned could still discern targets with the nsked
eye out to 50 yds. All actual shooting was done with the open
" sight and some difficulty was experienced in hitting the targets
at ranges of 100 yds. or sore even at dusk. The closer targets
could be easily hit up until it becass tco darz to see them at all.
4 large rain cloud poving from behind the firing position gradually
obscured all available light. For the final shooting at 25 yds.
occasional lightning flashes gave only a vague awareness of the
target location. At no time during the night trials was there an:
“murzle flash visible fros the under loaded axcunition and muzzle =
Biloncér combination. @ gas por was ‘6 OFF position
furtag the day. Tials was turned on at night but no flash was
visible at the breech. A fine white cloud of cream of wheat
powder was visible in front of the muzzle at almost full darkness
but could not be seen more than 30 feet avay. .

6, Listener trials vere conducted the following day to deter-
wine bow far away an alert listener could discern the mechanical

“Boise of the mechanism and that of the round being fired. Mr.

walked away downvind at an sngle of 90 degrees to the line of ire

and stopped to listen every 25 paces. The undersigned fi:

Single rounds, (hand actuating the nechanisa) each time Mr.

Stopped, At 325 paces, or roughly 375 yds., Er. reported _

be could still hear the mechanism being actuated, the round being

fired, and the bullet striking a concrete Pillar 200 yds. down-

_ Fange. However, he stared that he night not have noticed the sound
a@t that range had he not been listening for it specifically,

* 7. One of the major causes for concern at the start of the
tests was that the cream of wheat filler night clog the silencer
and render it ineffective. A total of 200 rounds were fired with
the silencer in place and the noise level did seem to be higher at
the finish of the second day. (Round numbers 180 to 200 were the
ong® expended during the previously mentioned listener trials).

- Inspection of the silencer at a later date revealed considerable
cream of wheat residue in the screening. Sound level measurenents
“ wade in the AMF sound lab shoved that while the total noise level
“- was no higher, the duration was relatively longer, This would

. make the silencer seem louder to near by observers but not increase
the range at which it could be heard. However, from a stand-
point of the ability for a listener to discrisinate a ailencer
being fired from random noise, the longer duration gives hina .
better chance to recognize what he hears. :

8. On 19 June 1964, the undersigned went to the warehouse
at Franconia to try to fit the sight hood to other 7.650m FAL
rifles. It was suspected that the fit might be a problem when it
gn Would not fit over the rear sights of three FAL rifles at Isolation.
Although it vas later determined that tho three rifles.vere of a |
@ifferent lot and may therefore have different toleranci on the 7
rear sight casting, it was felt that further checking was necessary.
Mine PAL rifles from the sane lot as those obtained by WH/SA/MOB/PH
were unpackaged and the sight hood tried on the rear sight. Of
the nine, two were perfect fits and the other seven too thick
for the hood to fit. This created a problem in that the sight
hoods had to fit rifles which for operational reagong could not be
measured before hand to determine the thickness of the rear sight
blade. Providing adjustment in the slot ef the sight hood vould
have complicated the fixture to the point whe: it could becone
operationally unsuitable. Therefore it was determined that the
best solution was to provide soveral small files with the hoods.
The Seep sight on the rifles, a soft casting, was found to be
: ‘quite easy to file. In most cases it would be necessary only to
file several thousandths to obtain a proper fit. This procedure
was explained to C/WH/SA/H0B/FM and he stated that it would bo suas

“+ geceptable. :

: 9. On 24 June 1964, three open sight hoods with accessories
nsisting of two files and a small screwdriver were turned over

to C/WH/8A/KOB/PH. In addition, 400 rounds of improved under-

loaded ammunition with cream of wheat filler were provided as a

oe he. lacemont for the original 400 underloaded rounds.

thy —.y 10, On 29 June 1964, it was discovered that a scope was availab)
ited Visa for the 7.62mm Belgium (FAL) Rifle (Sniper Version) and in the Agency

supply system. Steps are being taken to obtain a scope for “4
evaluation, The results will be forwarded to C/##/SA/M0B,
