Testa were conducted in the evening to determine the degree

of usefulness of the sight in poor light.

Is this respoct a 22

Caliber Hi-Standard pistol with folding shoulder stock and Bushnell

1.38 Phantom scope was tested in comparison.

The scope was

@quipped with yellow filters to brighten the sight ploture for

dow light level use.

It was the opinies of both teat personnel

that the scope was suparior to either the poop sight or open aight

fos as long as their uns sone 1llumiration on the silhouette

targets.

Once the light failed the scope was completely useless

"Ithough the undersigned could still discers target. with the asked

eye out to 50 yde.

All actual shooting was done with the open

sight and some difficulty was experienced in hitting the targets

at ranges of 100 yds, or sore even at dusk.

To closer targets

could be esally hit up until 1t vocase too dari to see them at all.

A largo rain cloud soving from behind the firlay position gradually

obecured all available light. For the final abooting at 25 yde.

occasional 11ghtning flashes gave only a vague avaroness of the

target location.

.At so tise duriog the night trials vas there any

muzzle flash visible fros the under loaded argunition and suzzle

BiJoncer combination.

The gas port vitea vas in the oil position

during the daylight trials was turned on at night hut no flash was

vialble at the breech.

A fine white cloud of cream of weat

powder as vialble in front of the mzale at almost lull darkness

but could not be seen sore than 30 feet away.

6 Listener trials vere conducted the following day to deter

However, he stated that he night not have noticed

One of the major caused for concern at the start of the

tests was that the cream of wheat 11ller night clog the silencer

and render 1t ineffective.

A total of 200 rounds vere fired with

the silencer in place and the noise level did seen to be higher at

the finish of the second day.

(Bound zumbers 180 to 200 were the

ones expended during the previously sentioned listener trials).

Inspection of the silencor at a later date revealed considerable

cream of wheat renide in the screening.

Sound level measurenente

made in the All sound lab showed that unile the total noise level

was no higher, the duration as relatively longer.

This would

make the siloncer seen louder to near by observers but not increase

the range at which it could be heard.

However, from a stand

point of the ability for a lintoner to disoriainate a milencer

being fired from randon noise,

the longer duration given hin a

bottor chance to rocognise shar he hears.

On 19 June 1964, the undersigned vent to the varehouse

at Frarconia to try to

fit the sight hood to otber 1. 65m. In

rifles.

It was suspected that the fit might be a problem when it

would not fit over the rear sights of three fAl rifles at Isolation.

Although it was lator doteruinod that the taros rifles vore of a

different lot and may therefore have different tolerances on the

rear sight casting, it vas felt that further checking was necessary.

Nine PAl rifles from the sane lot as those obtained by WH SA/MOB/PH

were unpackaged and the sight hood tried on the rear sight.

01

the nine, two were perfect fits and the other seven too thick

for the hood to fit.

Tain created a problem da that the bigai

hoods had to fit rifles which for operational reasons could not be

masured before hand to deteraine the thickness of the rear sight

blade.

Providing adjustsent in the glot of the eight hood would

have complicated the fixture to the point where it could become

operationally unauitable.

Therefore it was determined that the

best solution vas to provide several sull files with the hoods.

The peep sight on the rifles, a soft casting, was found to be

quite easy to 111o.

In most cases it would be necessary only to

file several thousandths to obtain a proper 11t.

Thia procedure

was explained to C/H/SA/NOB/Fu and he stated that it would be

acceptable.

On 24 June 1964, three open sight hoods with accessorses

consisting of two files and & mall acrowdriver were turned over

tO C/OR/ BA/NOB/PH.

In addition, 400 rounds of laproved under.
