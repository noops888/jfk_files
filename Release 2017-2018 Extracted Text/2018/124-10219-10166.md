Colonel HARVEY stated that according to his -
information there are approximately three hundred men in
all in training. He said he understands they are being
trained for infiltration into Cuba and not for invasion
purposes. It was his belief that Puerto Viego was used
by the trainees as their headquarters but said there
seemed to be considerable movement between the two camps.

He was unable to state whether the Cubans being
trained in Costa Rica were members of subject organization
and could furnish no identifying data on the Cubans in
charge of these men.

On March 3, 1964, Lt.Col.. FERNANDO FIGULS QUIROS,

Head of the Security Agency in San Jose and Advisor to the
President, advised that the correct name of LUDWIG STACKY
is VEKO STACKY. He described him as a very rich individual
who is friendly with the President of Costa Rica and is

a head of the anticommunist movement. He said that anti-
CASTRO Cubans are training on his land and also on the
land of TEODORO QUIROS, He said this training is not for
purposes of invasion but to prepare the men for infiltration
and sabotage. He estimated there were one hundred men under é)
training.

On March 3, 1964, Captain GONZALO ARAYA, Second
in Charge, Security Agency, San Jose, stated the anti-CASTRO
Cubans in Costa Rica receiving training in infiltration
and sabotage were members of the Movimiento Recuperacion
Revolucionario, which, he said, in his opinion, was an
anti-CASTRO movement headed by MANUEL ARTIME and MANOLO RAY.@ )
