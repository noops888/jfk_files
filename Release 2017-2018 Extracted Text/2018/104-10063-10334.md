IN MIAMI AREA FOR REVIEW BY AMBEDEW-I. WE ARE SHOWING THESE

TO AMMUG-1 AND AMCARD-LO THESE WERE SHOWN TO AMGAME-I, WHO

COULD NOT IDENTIFY•

20 TWO POINTS IN REF ARE WORTHY OF COMMENT IN THAT WE

ARE TAKING WORD OF PERSON LIKE WYSAGE-I IN THIS MATTER. FIRST,

JUST BECAUSE SHE CALLED CUBAN AN ILLEGAL" DOES NOT NECESSARILY

MEAN THAT SUCH IS CASE. SHE MIGHT BE SAYING THIS IO IHROW US

OFF OR ON OTHER HAND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS BY CUBANS.

THUS, DO NOT BELIEVE WE CAN DISMISS COMPLETELY POSSIBILITY

THAT CUBAN IN QUESTION IS DIPLOMAT. SECONDLY, QUESTION OF

SCAR SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED AS GOSPEL, SINCE IT COULD BE

CONTRIVED MARK OR EVEN SUBRERFUGE ON PART OF HYSAGE 1.

3. SINCE TRAFFIC THIS MATTER NOW MICHAOS, PLEASE ADVISE

IF WE CAN COMMUNICATE LATERALLY WITH
