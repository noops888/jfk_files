APPENDIX

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COLDUTTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times" newspapo:

contained a full-page advertisement captioned "What Is Really

Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

(FPCC) :

For a cioa do neutrate entrate the disto to a

American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subconmittee on January 10, 1961, D:.

CHARLES A. SANTOS-SUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER 25

organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and TABER obtained

funds fron the Cubar. Government which were applied toward the cost

•of the afore-mentioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963,

a source advised that during the first

two years of the FPCC's existence there was a

struggle betveen

Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP) elenents

to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby influence FPCC

policy.

However, during the past year this source observed there

has been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to minimize tho

role of these and other organizations in the FPCC so that today

their influence is negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the

National Headquarters of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799

Broadway, New York City. According to this source, the position

of National, Office Director was created in the Fall of 1962 and

was filled by VINCENT "Ted" LSE, who now formulates FPCC policy.

This source observed LEE has followed a course of entertaining

and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations

Including the CP and the SWP when he has felt it would be to his

personal benefit as well as the FPCC's. However, LEE has indicated

to this source he has no intention of permitting FPCC policy to be

deternined by any other organization. LEE feels the FPCC should

•advocate resumption of diplonatic relations between Cuba and the

United States and support the right of Cubans to manage their

revolution without interference from other nations, but not

support the Cuban revolution per se.

The CP and the SWP have been designated pursuant to

Executive Crder 10450.
