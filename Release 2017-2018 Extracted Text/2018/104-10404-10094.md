MEMORANDUM FOR: Anthony A. Lapham

FROM

SUBJECT

: A. R. Cinquegrana

Office of General Counsel

: BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE Soft File Review - "Kelly" -

Dimitrov, D.A.

1. I have been reviewing summary sheets prepared by the Office of

Security concerning several hundred soft files on individuals associated,

or considered for association, in some way with the Agency's BLUEBIRD/

ARTICHOKE activities. In the course of that review I came upon the follow-

ing case which I discussed with Dick Lansdale and which we agreed should

be brought to your attention for your information and whatever action you

may deem appropriate.

2. As is indicated in the attached copy of the soft file summary and

the 27 January 1952 memorandum upon which it is based, D. A. Dimitrov,

designated "Kelly," is a Bulgarian expatriate who appears to have been

imprisoned in Greece some time in 1950 and 1951 on false pretenses because

the Agency feared he would accept an offer from French Intelligence. After

six months in custody, he was flown to Panama where he was misrepresented

as a psychopath and confined in a U.S. Military Hospital for several months.

The official security file shows he was then removed from the hospital and

held by the Agency at Fort Clayton in Panama for three years. He was then

returned to Greece and ultimately allowed to enter the U.S. as a refugee.

It appears from the attached copy of a 7 February 1952 memorandum that.

the "Artichoke approach," i.e., the use of drugs to reverse his hostility

toward the U.S. and U.S. intelligence agencies, was never consummated.

3. This man has had several contacts with the Agency since coming

to the U.S. In 1961 an Assistant to the DCI was contacted by a representative

of Parade magazine who had been informed by Dimitrov of his confinement

by the Agency. The Office of Security responded to the effect that this man

was disreputable, unreliable, and full of wild stories about CIA. As you

will note from the attached transcript of an 8 September interview on Good

Morning America, Mr. Dimitrov (now General Dimitrov and known as General

Donald A. Donaldson) apparently is alive and alleging that he knows who

ordered the assassination of President Kennedy.

4. Based solely upon the soft file summary, and prior to reviewing

the official security file from which I extracted the additional details, it

appeared to me that the nature of the Agency's treatment of Dimitrov might

be something which should be brought to the attention of appropriate

officials both within and outside the Agency. The fact that he is still

active and is making allegations connected with the Kennedy assassination

may add yet another dimension to this story.

I. Soft File Summary

1. Title of File: Kelly

2.

Brief Biographic Data: Kelly's true name is

DIMITROV, a 29-year-old Bulgarian who was head of

a small political party based in Greece and

ostensibly working for Bulgarian independence.

3.

Nature of Relationship/Interest:. It was learned

that French Intelligence Service was attempting

to bribe KELLY and make him a double agent and

Kelly appeared to be interested in the French offers.

Accordingly, a plan was made to have KELLY believe

that he was

going to be assassinated and for protec-

tion he was placed in custody of the Greek police

who then put him in prison.

KELLY was held in the

prison for six months until the Greek authorities

decided that KELLY was was a nuisance and they told

our people to take him back. He was then flown to

Panama where; through arrangement, he was placed in

a U. S. military hospital as a psychopathic patient.

According

to the 25 January 1952 memorandum, KELLY

had been in the hospital for several months

and the

hospital authorities want him out since he is causing

He is not a psychopathic personality.

Because of his confinement in a Greek prison and his

stay in a military hospital, KELLy became very hostile

toward the United States and our intelligence opera-

tions in particular.

OPC was considering an "ARTICHOKE" approach to KELLY

to see if it would be possible to reorient KELLY

favorably toward us.

the top level of OPC to the handling of the KELLY

case in the manner that had been proposed.

Since

this opposition had arisen, nothing would

be done

to the KELLY case.

Office of Security File Summary - DIMITROV, Dimitre

Adamov (lyle 0. Kelly) (QKSTAIR) (SHAM/BGCONVOY)

#46165

1. Short Summary of Agency Interest/Use:

The file was opened in October 1950, when DIMITROV

was of operational interest to the Agency while

employed for Radio Athens in Greece.

Previously,

DIMITROV had fled from Bulgaria in

• July 1947. As

of October 1951, DIMITROV was in a hospital in

South America,

apparently under Agency

auspices.

In 1956 DIMITROV was brought to the United States,

apparently after returning to Athens from South

America,

and the Agency made no further operational

use of DIMITROV. In June 1960 DIMITROV [under case

#33259--Dimiter DIMITROFF ("Diko")] had contact

with the Contact Division outlining his background,

claiming financial difficulties, and requesting the

Agency back his plans for covert activity against

Bulgaria.

The Agency apparently took no action in

this regard.

During this contact DIMITROV claimed

that circa 1951 he was held in a hospital/cell in

Panama City.

Morse Allen

SUBJECT: Kelly Cage

On Fridas, 25 January 1952, the writer was called to tha office

of Mr. Bannerman for ths purposa of a conference with one Mix:

EE/OPG, concerning the instant case.

HIs

explaired in substance the Kelly case as follows:

Kel}y, (whose real name is Dinitror), is a 29-year-old Bulgarian and

was the head af a snall political party based in Greace and catansivaly

worlding for Bulgarian indapendance. Kelly was described by

as being young, anbitions, brigat (elementary collega education), a

sort of a "man-on-a-horsg" typs but a typical Balkan politician- Ac-

cording to Prichatt, our people discovered that Frenca Intelligenca

Sarvice wry attempting to bribe Kelly and maks him a double agent and

Kelly was looking wits favor upon the french offarg. Accordiazly,

plot was rigged in nich kelly was told ha was going to be

and as a "protaction", he was placed in custody of the Greek Police

who threw Kally Into a Greek prison.

Kelly was held in tha Grees pri

son for sir nonths until the Greek aurborities dacided that Kelly was

a nuisance and they tald our people to take him back. Since out

people were unabla to dispose of Kelly in Grasce,

thay fley hin to

Panana there, through arrangenant, ha was placed in a U.S. Mlitary

Hospital as a psychopathic patient. Kelly no has been in tag U.S..

military hospital for several montes and the hospital authorities now

want to get him out since ha is causing considerable trouble, bothering

other patients, ate. Kelly is not a psychopathic parsonality.

explained that they can dispose of kelly by the simle

process of sending him to a friend of his in Caracas, Venezuela, and

as far as they are concerned, that type of disposal is perfectly o.k.

Howaver, because of his confirement in a Greek prison and his stay in

a military hospital, Kelly has become vary hostile tonard the United

States and our intelligence operations in particular. Hence, O7C is

considaring an "Artichoke" approach to Kelly to see if it would ba

possible to re-orient Kally favorably toward us. This operation, wich

will necessarlly lavolve the use of drags is being considered by OPC

with a possibllity that Dr. Ecka and Mike Gladych will carry out the

operation presumably at the military hospital in Panama. Also in-

volved in this would be a Bulgarian interpreter who is a consultant

to this Agency since neither Icke nor Gladych speak Bulgarian. :

Mr. Bancarnan pointed ont to

_that this type of operation

could only be carried out with the authorization of Securlty and that,

under no circunstances whatsoever, could axyone but an authorized l.D.

adninister drugs to any subject of this Agency of any type. Bancernan

pointed out that there was a strong possibility that the military

and the Bulgarias interpreter retum fron Boston and their talk with

Mise Gladyco. At which time, the angles would be explored and a d13-

moor would be forarded to our paople in Panana directing then to

fiod out whether the Amy would permit such an oparation ard whether

the Army would allow the Agency to have the use of the racessary rocha,

Venezuela could in fact be laid on.

Coment:

This particular operation was nentioned in general terms to the

writer by dr. Waltar Driscoll approximately thirty days ago on an in-

formal basis but no significant details wers given at this time.

While the technique that Ecke and Gladych are considering for uso

In this case is not known to the sriter, the writer beliaves the aporcach

will be made through tha standard narco-hypnosis techniqua. Re-conditioning

and re-orienting an individual in such a matter, in the opinion or 4h9

writer, cannot be accomplished easily and will require a great deal of

tire and the & fact that an interpreter is necessary in the case con

plicates it considerably more. It is also believed that with our preset i

knowledge, we sould have no absoluta guarantae that the subject in this

case would maintain a positive friendly attitude toward us even though

there is apparently a successiul response to the treatment. The writer

did not suggest tol

that perhaps a total amnesia could be created

by a series of electro shocks, but merely indicated that amnasias under

drug treatrents were not certain.

VILLAM ALTMANS: My new source is General Donald A. Donaldso

as to The

It's -not my job.

BOB CLARK:: And you have talked at length with General

ALTMANS:. Oh, yes:

• CLARK: Has he revealed the name of the man he regards

as the assassin, the man who directed the assassination, to you?

ALTMANS: I understand your question, Bob. I would like

not to answer that, because

I don't want to endanger myself any

all this Information on tape to the justice Departmant.

One thing that I find confusing.

about knowing who

ALTMANSE Who gave the order, he

says.

CLARK: Gave tha order:

of 1962.when he.met with Kennedy?

Is he talking about the period

ALTMANS: Exactly: Exactly.

CLARK:

So he is not saying that he knows the man sho

gave the order in 1963 to commit the assassination.

ALTMANS:: That, according to the General, Is the same

- the

same

.person.- It's the sama group. There Is no difference

between 162 and !63. As a matter of fact, he maintains that Pre

sident Kennedy was.

first warned of an assassination plot against

him by Soviet

intelligence,

and

he claims that he was called In by

John. F.

• Kennedy to the White House

because they knew each other,

like he also had known President Truman and President Roosevelt,

ex-President Roosevelt. He was

called In by John F. Kennedy to

the White House and he was told by President Kennedy that he knew

That an assassination plot

was discovered against the life of Pre-

sident Kennedy. And President Kennedy asked General Demetroff

to assist- in the Investigation to unravel this, to take counter-

measures against this plot. And of course they falled.

And he says that he now has a new witness who patentially

can answer a lot of questions about the kennedy assassination,

give spectfic detalls about it.

•You say, Mr. Altmans, that this man is a General Donaldsan,

that. he sent a letter to Senator Frank Church In September of

1975.

•NOW

what happenad with that letter? And what all did it

entall?:

ALTMANS:

Well,

as you

he offered to testify for

his knowledga. of who ordered the assassina

tion of John F.. Kennedy.

And of course, it is quite surprising

that

according

to. General Donaldson, he

was recelved by President

Ford: In the White House In February, 1976 and discussed

at length

the assassination with

former President Ford.

And this Is important.

He Is so emphatic about. it that I think It is Important enough infor

mation

to be Investigated by the Select Committee on Assassinations-

HILL: But what happened at that time when he sent the

letter?

ALTMANS: He sald - he says that President Ford, Senator

Church and

he cama to an agreement

not to bring up this information

that he had at that time. I guess that he - and he put so many

conditions to the release of this Information that President Ford

and Mr. Church

found It unacceptable.

HILL:

Mr. Altmans, this morning, Bob. and I had an

opportunity to see this

letter as well.

seemed rambling---

same thing as you do.
