busy downtown section of Mexico City. Prior to this operation, the arca was
cased by FRANCOTTE who selected a room in a nearby hotel overlooking and approxi-
nately one-half block from the target area, as being the most advantageous point
from which to photogreph the meeting, A KUBARK staffer, under alias, then rented
this particular room, retaining occupancy until after the operation, From the
hotel room window, FRANCOTTE successfully photographed the meeting, with the aid
of a Balscope and Pentex camere. I.D. photographs of FUSTEAL officers, acting as
counter-surveillance in this operation, were also obtained.

B. At the request of Lee R, MYLECHRAINE, the LIFIRE photographic truck
was activated for a motion picture operation on 2% November. MYLECHRAINE requested
1ém black and white motion picture coverege of a possible “agent recruitment"
Which was to take place at a prearranged location, Although the recruitment was
unsuccessful, FRANCOPTE exposed approximately fort feet of Tri-X film, obtaining
motion pictures of Oliver Q. WIMPHEN engaged in conversation with the target indi-
vidual.

C. The LIONION photographic basehouse was partially reactivated on
25 November, at which time FRANCOTTE supplied LIFEUD-22 with e Pentax camera
and Belscope. The Station is now receiving daily coverage of all activity centered
around the gate of the PBRUMEN Embassy. FRANCOTTE is meeting LIFEUD-22 twice
weekly to receive the undeveloped film which is then being processed and printed
in the Station KURIOT Lab, It is anticipated that the LIONION basehouse darkroom
equipment and pulse camera will be reinstalled in the near future.

D. The passport camera is operating satisfactorily, although it was
necessary for FRANCOTTE to remove this particular piece of equipment for necessary
repairs. A second camera wes installed during this short period of time. The
inoperative camera wes taken to (MKCHARITY where the repairs were effected, with the
helpful assistance of Joseph M. RESCIGNO.

EB. Photographic coverage of the DIZTAG Embassy, supplied by LIHABIT,
was normal during this reporting period. Seventeen agent meetings were held by
FRANCOITE during the month of November,

5. Station Support.

a. The microfilming project for thé RI/Registry Section 1s continuing
satisfactorily. A total of 1200 feet of microfilm was processed by FRANCOTTE
during this reporting period.

b. Seventy-five feet of microfilm was exposed on 12 November to fulfill
a monthly requirement for the Chief of Station and Steff D.

c. In support of a standing monthly requirement of the KURIOT Postal
Intelligence Section, FRANCOTTE purchased 1000 Mexican postage stamps on 18
November. These stamps, for the December mailing, were forwarded to KURIOT
Headquarters via HMMA-24795, dated 20 November,

ay The Nikon Repro Kit, camera, and Micro-Nikkor lens, requested
several months ago by FRANCOTTE, was received during this reporting period and
immediately placed into operation, With the exceptionally high volume of require-
ments for "photos of photos", this equipment is e most welcome addition to the
KURIOT Lab.

e. A total of 37 job orders were completed during this reporting period,
with a print production grand total of 533. There is no back~log et this time.

6, Secret Writing Activity.

a, On 10 November, at the request of the Deputy Chief of Station,
Robert L, EASBY, FRANCOTTE opened and completely tested a letter, suspected of
connection with the ZRKNICK activity, for the possible presence of secret writing.
The bath sheet process, in which FRANCOTTE was trained at KURIOT Headquarters,
was applied on both the letter and envelope. ‘The results were negative. The en-
velope was then reassembled, the letter inserted, the envelope resealed and placed
back into the local mail system,

b. On 3 November, two SW messages were received from DEGRIP, written
in the 37 Carbon System, Both messages developed exceptionally wéll and were
100% recoverable.

7. Flaps and Seels Operations.

a, At the request of Michael C. CHOADEN, FRANCOTTE successfully opened
and resealed an unofficial "Prensa Latina" pouch, forwarded from PBRUMEN and
addressed to the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City. The outer wrapping, a large
brown envelope was securely sealed with paper tape. The contents consisted of
five medium-size envelopes, addressed to numerous Latin American countries. Each
of these envelopes contained smaller envelopes addressed to individuals within
these countries, Since FRANCOTTE was only afforded seventy-five minutes to
complete the operation, CHOADEN first selected the envelopes thought to be of
most importance, and these were opened, photographed and resealed. The remaining
time Was devoted to opening and resealing the lesser important correspondence.
During the time allowed, fourteen envelopes were opened, their contents photo-
graphed, and the envelopes resealed. FRANCOTTE was able to reuse the original
paper tape in reassembling the outer envelope of the pouch.

b. In addition to the operation described in the above paragraph,
FRANCOTTE opened six other letters during November, Each letter was checked by
non-destructive methods for the presence of secret writing, photographed and
resealed.

8. Documentation.

On 3 November, FRANCOTTE documented Floyd N, AIMONET with various U.S.
alias documents. These documents were to be used by AIMONET while on a TDY
within Mexico, Numerous credit and "flesh" cards were issued by FRANCOTTE,
including a State of Joperator's license.

9. Operational Disguise Activity.

During the month of November, Lola M. CAPOZZI was requested via

DIR-62810 to TDY to the Panama Station for two days, beginning 16 November 1964,
The purpose of the trip was a briefing for CAPOZZI on new disguise cases being
programmed there by Gary T. BERNARD, who wes on TDY from KURIOT/Disguise in
Heedquerters, These persons will be trained by CAPOZZI in application of the
matericls, CAPOZZI will again TDY to the Paname Station when the supplies are
