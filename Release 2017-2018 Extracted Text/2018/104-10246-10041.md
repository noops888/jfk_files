two SW messages were received from DEGRIP, written

In the 37 Carbon System. Both messages developed exceptionally well and were

100% recoverable.

At the request of Michael C. CHOADEN, FRANCOTTE successfully opened

and resealed an unofffcial

"Prensa. Latina" pouch, forwarded from PBRUMEN and

addressed to the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

The outer wrapping, a large

brown envelope was securely sealed with paper tape.

The contents consisted of

five medium-size envelopes, addressed to numerous Latin American countries.

Each

of these envelopes contained smaller envelopes addressed to individuals within

these countries.

Since FRANCOITE was only afforded seventy-five minutes to

complete the operation, CHOADEN first selected the envelopes thought to be of

most Importance,

and these were opened, photographed and resealed.

The remaining

time was devoted to opening and resealing the lesser Important correspondence.

During the time allowed, fourteen envelopes were opened,

their contents photo-

graphed, and the envelopes resealed.

FRANCOTTE was able to reuse the original

paper tape in reassembling the outer envelope of the pouch.

FRANCOTTE opened six other letters during November. Each letter was checked by

non-destructive methods for the presence of secret writing, photographed and

resealed.
