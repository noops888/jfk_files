Washington; D.C. : "ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Dear John: : ae ‘ Eg) eee at cae

It is two weeks today that J was interviewed by Mr. ELLIF£ of the Senate
Committee, in the Senate Office Building, pursuant to arrangements which you
made at his request. Knowing that you and the Bureau might be interested in :
at jntarview, IT admit that I am de’ eLinquent in my i

The interview “began at 10:90 asm. and lasted for two and one-half hours, It
Was pleasant e bales in all shat esas in good humor throughout, “"t

receiving a synopsis of t

reporting, Tthenin

EILifE's stated purpose in interviewing m2 Was to eae the origins and fence
tions of the Bureau's Office of Legal Counsel. So, during mucn of thea interview

I talked and he wrote furiously. Synopsizad, oF course, T went throughs tne his- i

tory as follows.

In the beginning-dating everything (as in Christianity) from the time that

‘a certain noted figure took over-there was no in-house counsel. :There seem to
be two reasons, First, tha vast majority of She Agants were law trained. I chink |
ulppe

the figure for 1940, when I entered, “as 90 per cent. Thus the Agents ware e
ed by training to provide their own legal guicelines. Second, the criminal iaw
was at that tine very simpla, Few of the FBI arrests, searches, and interroge-
tions were challenged in the courts. A -

During this period the unofficial in-house counsel was Judge Holtzoff, then
@ prominent lawyer in-the Department of Justices, \ihen Hoover had a legal ques-

thon of significance he consulted Hottzoff; the old files se show,

Somewhare in the middle 1940's (I guass at this from inadaquite data) thea
FI decided for soma reason not known to me to set up the Legal Research Yes
in the then Training and Inspection Divislon, I suppose that as the jurisdice
tion and the staff of the BI grew sviftly so also did the number of Legal
questions ralsed, Co che polne where thy informal Hoover-Holtzoff system proved
inadequate. Tc Was a ona-man desk, occupied by, ka among others, Inspectur NNAN
James Carlson, Chester vontz (now deceased), Frank Strong, Mace Scovell, and
othsrs unknown to me. J took over in 1955. 7

Beginning hhortly after ny the volume of logal questions began to

‘had greatly declined. It thus was obvious that both the supervision “f legal

swell. This development followed on the new "activist" approach of the Supreme
Court under \iarren which brought the landmark decisions of Mallory, Mapp, Mire
anda, and ‘so.imany others, all of which complicated the criminal Law enormously
for both FBI Agents and for the officers-of other jurisdictions to whom the -FBI
taught criminal law in the FBI National Academy and elsawhsre, More than that,
these decisions came at a tima when the percentage of lawyers in the Agent force *

matters’ and the training given to Agents and other officers must be greatly in-

ereased,. This brought y ou and John ilotis and others into the function, for
Donelan and I could no longer carry the load.

The final step was tha establisiment of tha Office of Legal Counsel as a sep~
arate division of rhe F This happened without advance notice-to me, It was
in January or February of 1971 (memory fades) when Hoover calldd me to his off
ice. He opened by naming about five Federal ‘law enforcement aganciss such as the -
Secret Service, the Narcotics Bureau, and others, that had their own comnsel
end concluded by caying that the FBI had greater naed of in-house counsel than
any of these, He made ine Inspector in Charge, ard 17 days later mada me Assis~.
tant Director. r ei -

“ELLE was interested in knowing why Hoover chose that moment to create the
new division. I told him, and quite truthfully, that I did not know-Hopver did
not say, at least not to ma. Elliff pressed the matter, ka and I pointed out
that I could only speculate. The best spaculation, la my opinion, is that ‘the

ve was Yelated to the extre barassmenct which ¢ame to Hoover because of
his public statement, prior to any grand jury action, concerning the evidence
against those two priests and their followers who were alleged to be planning
to blow up the District sewer system. That statement, I pointed out, was never
brought to my attention until after it had been made. Had I known of it in ade
vance, I would have strongiy counseled against it, Somewhere in this/time area, . .

I speculated, Hoover must have decided that he badly needed a closer egal mone }
itoring of everything that went on in the FBie . eee 7 .

!
i

This brought up the anan$lous position so long occupied bythe Legal Research. ,
Desk which had so troubled ine. I was absolutely and totaily responsible for ane
sering any legal question raised to my by anyone in the FBI, but I had no au-
thority whatsoever to inquire into legal problems ‘not raised to mes This tinstx
situation changed completely when the new division was established, Cur first
erders from Sioover were to "see everything" going out of the F3I that migt
embody or affect a legal question, We strove manfully to do so for a while, but
the volume of paver coming across the dask was simply too Large. So, with foover':
permission and over his’ signature, I put out a motice to all headquarters pers-
onnel which made each supervisor, division, etc., initially responsible for -
vecogniztng tha actual or possible existence of a Legal problem and which dirs
ected them to bring all such problems to our attention. And so iff went until I

retired. eeger

eb SIENA

ELLI££ was interested in knowing why I was so quickly raised from Inspactor-
in-Charge to Assistant Director. Again, Hoover never told me, but if one must
speculate T would sugsast that it was because I handled to his satisfaction two

from the General Intelligance Division that a file be established’ on each Sen-
ator ‘and U.S. Representative and that/into Lhat file be thrown all miscellaneous
“{nformation concerning the person that came to our attention without investiga»
tion, The purpose was entirely innocent, and of some efficiency, viewed solely
from an investigative standpoint, The #BI had lately become responsible for in-

: _vestigating attacks against these people, and it is sensible to believe that the
more the Agent knows about the victim the better the chance he has cf solving the
crimé. But, T countered, the fact that the 73I kept such files would filter out
to public knowledge and immediately be misinterpreted to mean that the FBI vas”
actively surveilling and monitoring the activities of the legislators, Tnis vould
mot do. Hoover agreed. About the same time there came from the Domestic Intallie
gence Division a proposal that ah informant -be sent to Canada to gather informe
ation ‘there on certain U.S. citizens in whom the FBI had a legitimate’ interest.
Canada was not to be infomned. I countered th. this was unwise; something of ~

> the same kind had happened’a few years earlier, had been discovered, and had re~
sulted in quite a stink being raised in the Canadian Parliament. I “sug. ted that
the FBI work kx this informant through the RC: Hoover agread, and it was so
_done to the benefit of both this country and Canada and without‘an unfortunate “-

incident. | 7 Perec aepee! eee

Both these matters, it might be pointed out, Were not strictly legal. But the
effective lawyer remembers that just as no man is an island neither is a legal

* question. The question exists always in some political, economic, sociological,:
: or philosophicai context, und these may alter or even change what would ather-

. wise be the narrow legal, ansver to a probleme | tet

We next discussed, at Elliff's request, the functions of the Office of Legal
Counsel, More pointedly, why could not thasé functions be performed by the U.S,
Attorney and the Department of Justice? For many reasons, I said. First, and in
general, it defies sll common sense and the laws of human nature to believe that
the Director of the FBI and his people can get adequate counsel from any lawyer -
over whom they have no control whatsoaver, whom they do not pay, promote or dew ?

: mote. The FBI must necessarily be in a position to demand a quick answer from Fi
7 counsel. The SAC in Butte, for example, may eall at 10:00 asm, or 10:09 Dolley i
as the situation requires. He has located a fugitive, and sees a potential search }
problem Ye might get a goed answer from the Department if wa write then.a EO H
‘and wait three weeks (and again we might not, depending on who ansvers © ques~ jf
tion over there). But the SAC cannot freeze the situation for three weeks. Second, |
the SAC needs a positive answer-a "do this" and “don't do that" answer, specific,
to the point, and susceptible of being transiated into iimnediate action. None of
this “on the one hand but hewever on the other" type of answer that bureaucrats
so often give. the FBI can command such an a of its own coun: >» and o£ no H
other. Nor can the U.S, Attorney ve relied upon for such answers, for several |

ae SPebbeni

+ reasons. Hany of the assistants are recently graduated schoolboys whose know -

- ledge of the criminal law is "hornbook" variety. Some U.S. Attorneys are overly
cautious, reluctant. to take a stand, with the result that the FBI would underuse
its authority, to the public detriment. Some are aggressive prosecutors out ‘to

malie a name for themselves and not a bit reiuctant to authorize an arrest or

search on dubious grounds, secure in the ‘knowledge that if the action fails the
newspaper headlines wlll trimpet the fact that it was the "£31 search" or arregt
that was illegal, making no mention of the "authority" on which the action was

taken. Thus it is that the FBI desire to keep {ts legal actions clean‘as a
tound's tooth may conflict with the ambition of the prosecutor. I still remember —
an Assistant. U.S, Attorney who spent half an hour on the telephone trying to

harangue, badger and bluff me into sending Agents out to arrest a Secret Serve

S, Attorneys simply went haywire in their interpret-
ation’ of the law. If I zemeber correctly, it was the U.S, Attorneys in the xaste

“ern District of Illinois and one the the districts of Mississippl] who once took

the position that a person arrested by the FBI mist te brought bafore the then
Commissioner by the arrestédg Agent and by no other. 2 had “to fight them toth
cown on that on# and it took a bic of doing. So, here again the FBI needed its

gan counsel, 7 : .

Functions of FBI inehouse counsel break down into a faw obvious categories,
J told EllifZ., Counsel must to some reasobable extent rove through cur) 7
work looking for problems, present and potential. Some can be solved on spot, |
so to speak. Others must be taken to the Department, such as those which necesse
arily involve Departzent or Administration policy, or which are of such pot
for damage that the 731 wants before acting to exhaust all expert advice availe-. :
able to it. It is a matter of considerable diser m to decide which questions
can and should be ansvered in-house, in order to not be badgering the Depertmet
every other minute, and which must be raised to the Department. This can be done
by an experienced FBI Agent-Lawyer, and by no other, And then
stant need for FSI legal instruction, which I described but on which I did not
dwell, believing the need to be obvious: and, in general, for the same reasons
as those discussed above. eee 7 :

In response to ELLIf£'s questions I admitted thet the eréat bulk of the work
of the Office of Legal Counsel came from the eriminal side of FBI jurisdiction.
And quite naturally so, If was (I speak of my time only)in the criminal area
that most he Agents were employad, And tt was with some historical justi~
fication that those doing intelligence work thought themselves not responsibie
to the criminal law, although we did all possitle to knock that error out of
their heads, They thought themselves only intelligence gatherers, and so they
were until the case suddenly turned into the offense of espionage or sor
it was then that we got such Eilascoes as that "high Sierras" case, which Hoover
anerily labeled the vorst search he had ever sean, The Agents took everything-
everything-in the cabin, carted it hundreds of miles to San francisco for fur-
ther examination, and we lost the search in the Supreme Court. They never asked
_for advice of counsel. Without the effective presence of-in-house counsel how -
great the danger today of another such fiasco when so few of the Agents are ‘law. .

“trained, 7 : a : eeeeeeeer! EPeeee

Tis discusssion led to talk of the slender legal jurisdiction for the work
‘of the Domestic Intelligence Division, 1 told ELIL£E that some in the FBI had
long been dissatisfled with tho matter, that I was among them, and that when Ed
Piller becama Assistant Director ha had Labored mightily for a change. Here I
warned ELLIZE that it.would be easy to so circumseribe FBI jurisdiction in this

are responsible for the work.

In answer to ELLI££'s questions, I disclaimed all responsibility of ‘the Office

the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Practices
and Procedures (Senator Edward M, Kennedy's committee), and
to the press, information concerning Navy projects from

indicates FBI was aware of programs but Laboratory has no
knowledge of any active participation by Bureau personnel,

On 11/4/75, Clark McGruder, Assistant to Admiral
Bobby R. Inman, Director of Naval Intelligence, informed me
that on 11/7/75 the Navy was going to release to aforementioned
committees and the press information on drug experimentation
and that the FBI was mentioned in the pertinent files.
Those files were reviewed at the Pentagon on 11/6/75 by
Supervisor J. P. Thomas of INTD. They had been classified L
"Secret" and "Top Secret" but now have been completely .
declassified. FBI was mentioned in connection with three — oO
projects, There are no FBI documents in the files, ‘

A memorandum dated 9/21/50 from Mr, Alberti to “
Mr. CG. D. DeLoach was a receipt signed by Mr. DeLloach for
one copy of "Drugs Stated To Have Been Used By Russians And
Germans In Interrogation Techniques," Alberti is identified
elsewhere in the file as Jacek H. Alberti, Office of Naval

develop a speech-inducing drug to obtain intelligence from

A memorandum dated 8/15/#% on letterhead of
Office of Chief of Naval Operations concerned "Top Secret
Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) Project on Speech~
Inducing Drugs," reported a meeting on 8/11/50 attended by
personnel of NMRI, CIA, Office of Naval Research (ONR), a
drug company representative and Mr, DeLoach and Mr. D. J.
Parsons of the FBI Laboratory. The purpose of the meeting
was to brief the FBI on a CIA project on narco«hypnosis and
on the NMRT project. Parsons reportedly said the FBI had
no such project, but had information on the experiences of
various police departments in the United States with speech-
inducing drugs. He agreed to make the FBI information
available to NMRI and CIA, ONR agreed to give FBI, NMRI
and CIA a study by ONR on projected research to improve -
polygraph reliability, Recipients were to give their comments
and recommendations on the study to ONR, At the meeting
NMRI gave DeLoach an 8/11/50 NMRI progress report on its
project, Parsons agreed to look into the possibility of
getting volunteers from prisoners in Federal institutions
and to supply NMRI with canabis (marijuana) and heroin to
the extent they might be available to the FBI, It is noted
that no FBI representatives were listed in the memorandum
reporting a 9/27/50 meeting of this group and there is no
further record-in the file of FBI participation. Neither is
there any record that the FBI supplied any drugs for the
project,

~ Material regarding project "CHATTER" included a «~~

carbon copy of a rough draft memorandum (no letterhead)
bearing the penciled date "11/50?" which contained the
following, "Since 1947 the Department of the Nawy has

In préliminary conversations with.staff of the Senate

these questions, I am sending all of them to you with the

NOTE:

This communication responds to referenced memorandum
which was received during the late afternoon of 10/31/75,
It is noted that Marvin asked that these questions be
responded to by TucSday morning, if possible, Marvin also
appended a handwritten notation requesting any documents
"you think useful that bear on these questions and that have
been forwarded to the Select Committee," A review of the
questions and materials already submitted to the Committee
indicates that we are unable to submit such specific documents
with these responses, although in certain instances we have
referred to a broad body of material which might serve as
background and which have already been submitted fo the SSC
as well as the Department,

MAIL OPENINGS

Q. What are the standards governing issuance of a warrant to
open mail?

RESPONSE: The standards governing issuance of a warrant to open
mail are set forth in Rule 41 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure
for the United States District Courts and cases such as Giordenello

v. U.S., 357 U.S. 480 (1958), lar v. Texas, 378 U.S.

Stanford v, Texas, 379 U.S. 47 , and US. v. Harris, 403
wv. eee (1971), which interpret the warrant’ clause of the Fourth
Amendment.

Briefly stated, a Federal law enforcement officer or an
attorney for the government must submit a sworn affidavit to a
neutral and detached magistrate. The affidavit must set forth
sufficient facts to support a finding by the magistrate of prob-
able cause to believe a erime has been eommitted and the letter,
described with particularity, is or contains evidence of a crime.

In U.S. v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249 (1970), law en-
forcement officers reasonably suspected a piece of mail contained
evidence of a crime. They seized the package and held it overnight
while the investigation continued. Additional facts were obtained
and a search warrant was issued authorizing the opening of the mail.
The Supreme Court held the police conduct was reasonable under the
Fourth Amendment.



MAIL OPENINGS
Q. What are the procedures for seeking a warrant to open mail?

RESPONSE: When a Special Agent of the FBI desires to seek a
search warrant commanding him to open mail, he must discuss
the case with a United States Attorney. If the United States
Attorney authorizes the Agent to seek a warrant, an affidavit
for a search warrant is prepared.

The affidavit is reviewed by the Special Agent, a
Special Agent who has received intensive training in legal
matters, the Agent's supervisor and the United States Attorney.
Following these reviews the Special Agent submits the affidavit
under oath to a magistrate.

As in any case, where sound judgement dictates, FBI
Headquarters and/or the Department of Justice also may be
contacted for their adviue before the affidavit is submitted
to the magistrate,

This same procedure is followed by FBI Agents in
applying for all search warrants.

MAIL OPENINGS

Question: Has any mail been opened in the past by the
FBI without a warrant?

Response: Yes. The FBI, between 1940 and 1966, operated
eight different programs involving selected
opening of the mail for the purpose of
datecting and identifying foreign agents who
threatened this nation's security and to
detect. other persons who indicated willingness,
and were in a position, to sell out this
country t& hostile foreign powers. In several
other iselated instances, mall was opened in
connection with the counterintelligence
vesponsibiligies ef the FBI.

Question: If so, when was the operation discontinued?

Response: ALL of these operations wore discontinued in
July, 1966.

Question: Under what authority was the mail openad?
What was the office of the official uho
approved the mail openings?

Response: Those operations were generally approved by
the late Directex John Edgar Hoover althouch
in certain instmmces they were approved by a
high-ranking subordinate Bureau official,

For your additional inforzation, you ore referred to
our Totter ‘bo the Attorney Ceneral dated September 8, 1975,
captioned “J. 8. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities (SS8C)," which contained complete details of these

operations. )

a, What are the procedures within the PET for seeking authorization
to exapioy electronic surveillance without a warrant?

Sesponset

An investigative Agent, who feels that justification oxists for
use of an electronic surveillance, will address a communication to the
Federal Gureau of Investigation (101) Headquarters setting forth the
nature of the case and the necessary facts to supsort his belief that this
technique is deeiczed necessary. This communication containing the
Agent's recozamendation is reviewed by the Avent's inmmediate
Supervisor. Should the Supervisor agree with the Agent, he will submit
the coxaraunication bearing his anproval to the Special Agent in Charge
of the field office who will carciully scrutinize the facts set forth and
if he agrees he will indicate his approval and send the cormwnication to
FEI Headquarters. Upon receipt at LI Headquarters, a Headquarters
Supervisor drafts a memorandum to the Attorney Ceneral (AG) setting
forth ali pertinent facts by which the request is believed justified
according to the language of 18 US Code 2511 (5).

The request is then presented for review and justification through
channels, ivc,, Headduarters Unit Chief, Section Chief, [ranch Chict,
Assistant Director of the Intelligence Vivision, Deputy Associate Director,
Associate Director, and with the final personal approval of the Director,
PEI, the request is forwarded to the Attorney General, noting that if the
request is not felt to be completely justified at any level, it is disapproved
or returned for further clarification or justification.

Yor your furthor edification, I have prepared a meoraorandan
to you dated Cctoser 31, 1075, and captioned "National Security Electronic

Surveillances {NSES)," wherein I furnigh detailed information regarding
our procedures, steps, and criteria for requesting and approving NSLS.

SURREPTITIOUS ENTRIES

Question: Has the FBI engaged in surreptitious entries for
purposes other than electronic surveillance?

Answer: Yes

Question: A. How many entries have been accomplished per year?

Domestic Subversive and White Hate Groups

At least fourteen domestic subversive targets were
the subject of at least 238 entries from 1942 to April, 1968.
At least three domestic subversive targets were the subject
of numerous entries from October, 1952, to June, 1966. One
white hate group was the target of an entry in March, 1966.

Foreign Intelligence Targets

During the period 1957 to 1967, surreptitious entry
was used against at least eleven foreign intelligence targets.
Since 1967, entries were made into the residences of six
hostile intelligence service agents, and into the residence
and office of a leader of a foreign-based terrorist organization.

Foreign Establishments

From February, 1954, to January, 1967, 133 entries
were made against 37 different foreign establishments.

Question: B. What were the purposes of the entries?

Domestic Subversive and White Hate Groups

fo obtain secret and closely guarded organizational
and financial information, and membership lists and monthly
reports of target organizations.

Foreign Intelligence Targets

To obtain information on such espionage paraphernalia
as radio and photographic equipment, secret writing materials,
and fraudulent identification papers.

Foreign Establishments

To obtain cryptographic materials necessary for

the National Security Agency (NSA) to fulfill its communications

intelligence (COMINT) target requirements.

‘

Question: C. Who approved the entries?

Domestic Subversive and White Hate Groups

Foreign Intelligence Targets

When a Special Agent in Charge (SAC) considered, the
technique justified and necessary a recommendation would be
made to FBI Headquarters to the appropriate Assistant
Director. A memorandum would be prepared for approval of
Director Hoover or Mr. Tolson, the Associate Director.

Foreign Establishments

A request would be made of the FBI by NSA, whereupon
a communication would be sent to the appropriate FBI field
office wherein was located the target establishment. If the
field office indicated an entry could be conducted with full
security, FBIHQ would be so advised.

7 We have been unable to locate documentation showing
the approving authority for these entries; however, the
significance and sensitivity of these matters indicates
approval was made on a high level at FBIHQ. 7
Question: D. Upon what authority were the entries conducted?
Domestic Subversive and White Hate Groups
Foreign Intelligence Targets

: Surreptitious entries were conducted upon authority
of FBIHQ.

-2-

" NW 55077 DocId:32989534 Page 52



| ase 55077 DoclId:32989534 Page 53

Foreign Establishments

Surreptitious entries were conducted upon authority
of FBIHQ at the request of NSA and under guidance of National
Security Council Intelligence Directive #9 (NSCID #9), which
directive was superseded by NSCID #6.

Question E. When, if ever, was the practice discontinued?
Domestic Subversive and White Hate Groups

In July, 1966, Director Hoover ordered the technique
of surreptitious entry discontinued. Mr. Hoover reaffirmed
his position against the practice in January, 1967. Review
of our records shows that thereafter only one entry was
conducted on April 2, 1968.

Foreign Intelligence Targets

In July, 1966, Director Hoover ordered the technique
of surreptitious entry discontinued. Mr. Hoover reaffirmed
his position against the practice in January, 1967. Review
of our records shows the last entry was conducted in August,
1974. :

Foreign Establishments

In July, 1966, Director Hoover ordered the technique
of surreptitious entry discontinued. In September, 1966,
Mr. Hoover reconsidered the practice and approved use of the
technique. In January, 1967, Mr. Hoover reaffirmed his
position against surreptitious entries and discontinued the
practice.

Q. Does the FBI disseminate information it has obtained
by the use of a search including electronic
sutveillance to other Federal agencies?

If so, what agencies and under what standards are
decisions made as to what infoxmation should be
disseminated?

RESPONSE, Yes, Information which has been obtained by
use of a search, both those based on a warrant and those
not based on warrant including electronic surveillance
is disseminated to other Federal agencies.

The Manual of Rules and Regulations (MRR) and the
Manual of Instructions (Moz) are the source of FBI policy
instructions relative to the dissemination of information
which comes into the possession ef the FBI. The MRR Part IT,
Section 5, states that "Dissemination is ordinarily restricted
to Federal agencies in the Executive Branch." In fact dis~
semination to such agencies comprises the vast majority of
information disseminated, Dependent however on the exigencies
of the situation information in certain instances may be dis-
seminated beyond Exeoutive Branch agencies. Thus the MRR
requires that where there is a threat to life, interested law
enforcement agencies with jurisdiction concerning the threat
must be advised as well as the intended victim. So also the
| MOI Part, Section 23, contains instructions which require
| that the FBI immediately notify local law enforcement con-
\ cerning bomb threats,

With regard to the standards employed in determining
which information merits dissemination the MRR Part II,
Section 5, establishes a backdrop against which and within
which dissemination is made. This section notes that "the
i proper utilization of information received by the Bureau,
| whether through investigation or otherwise is foremost among
i eur responsibilities. Such information may be of vital in-
| terest to another Government agency and/or local law enforce~
ment.,. » In all matters relating to dissemination, good
| judgdment and common sense should prevail. It is not the
Bureau policy to withhold from dissemination vital and impor-
Assoc. bx, __bant information to which other agencies, including local
Dep. AD Atm. Law enforcement, are justifiably entitled; however good
Dep ADI. —Fudgament and eommon sense dichated that the need to dissemi-~
man Rate’ must be both vital and important and within the scope of
—present requirements te do so. There must be no indiscrimi-
—nate ot arbitrary dissemination."

Furthermore, by provisions of Departmental Order 3464
signed by the Attorney General January 13, 1953, all files,
documents, records, and reports in the U. 5. Department of
Justice (including FBI) are to be regarded as confidential
in nature and the contents thereof are to be disclosed only
in the performance of official duties. This order clearly
prohibits any arbitrary or indiscriminate dissemination
and restricts dissemination to the requirements of the
performance of official duties.

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

In connection with the King matter and our

complete understanding of all actions, decisions,
proposals, recommendations and operations of FBI
personnel with respect to Dr. King during the months
of November and December 1964. Accordingly, I would
appreciate your asking -the Bureau to designate a
representative who can go through the FBI files for
those months relating to King with Mr. Epstein of our
staff sometime this week. In the event that the
November-December 1964 portions of the files contain
materials pertinent to our inquiry, but which we have
not yet requested, I trust that it will be acceptable
to you for such materials to be designated by Mr.
Epstein at the time of the review for delivery to
the Committee.

I would also appreciate your making available
this week all memoranda and other materials reflecting
‘proposals made or actions taken which pertain to the

“Was it made known by the CIA agent that the purpose of the
visit was to ease the pressure on issuance of a subpoena to
Dr. Joseph Smiley, former president of the University of
“Colorado? (Under such a subpoena, Smiley might have been
“required to reveal the agency that had given him the April _
1969 report that Riha was alive and well at that time.) ;
In December 1969, when Riha's dying mother,. Dr. Ruth Ann

Cook of Taunus, West Germany, contacted the FBI in Washing-
ton about her missing son, she was very anxious to "do any-
thing'’ to determine where he was and what had happened to
him. Yet the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) said in December 1969,
that Mrs. Cook declined the FBI's offer to place a missing
persons notice on Riha in the ‘EBL bulletin. What informa-

Attached herewith is my letter to Mr. E1liff confirming our

conversation of July 11. I think that it is approximately iden- 7
tical to the telephonic information I gave you on July 11. I may
have omitted something from our phone conversation; if I did,
please treat this letter as being explicitly articulate of the
agreement reached with ELliff.

I believe this document carries into effect the intentions
of the Attorney General expressed in our conference today. I am
sensitive to the issue of clearance on the Dr. King material, and

\ it will be raised when the summary consideration is reached.

Attached also is my memo to the Deputy Attorney \General

SUBJECT: ‘Letter Providing SSC_Access to DOJ/FBI Materials
1 ;

Attached is the original of my letter of today to Mr. Elliff
which is self-explanatory, and, I think, meets the issues raised in
the attachment to the July 9, letter from Senator Church and in our
conference with the Attorney General. : &

I believe the letter accurately states the Attorney General's
position on SSC access to the information requested. The General
Counsel's office of FBI has advised ie that Mr. Kelley may wish to
speak to the Attorney General before the letter is sent, because
of the broad policy problems pertaining to FBI files, TI have
advised Mr. Mintz that this letter fairly and accurately reflects
both my understanding of the AG's policy, and my recent coriversation
with the SSC staff in the implementation of that. policy. Mr. Mintz
has asked that the letter be delayed until Mr. Kelley has an oppor-
tunity to consider it; I have delayed sending the letter for that
reason, but feel it should go out today, since it simply confirms
a prior position.

I would hope that this letter and the access it authorizes
would facilitate the SSC Executive Session before which I under-
stand the Attorney General is to appear on Wednesday, July 16,
at 2:30. i

I am providing a copy of this memo, my memo to Mr. Mintz,
and the attached letter to Doug Marvin so that he may advise the
Attorney General of it. I understand from Elliff that the Conmittee
expects to ask the Attorney General about his views on the need for
subpoenas, and the "agreement" to be forthcoming which is referenced
in the’ June 24, letter.

Dear Mr, Elliff:

Pursuant to our conversation of July 11, and confimming it,
the following arrangements are approved for access to materials and
delivery of materials to the Senate Select Committee staff, in addi-
tion to that which has already been made available.

Please refer to the attachments to the July 3. letter:

|

Page 3, P: h 2, Subsection A. All of the FBI files on
the so called "Kissinger 17" surveillance will be made available to
you and your appropriately cleared staff in Rcom 4171 of the Hoover
Building. These documents may be reviewed and studied there, and
you and your staff may take such notes as you | deem appropriate; we
have agreed that: the notes are to be left in the secure room of the
Hoover Building during your study. Whén your study is ‘completed,
you will prepare a summary of the information which you consider
to be appropriate for Committee use. The summary will be checked
with senior Bureau executives to ensure the protection of national
security matters and observation of privacy considerations. There-
after, the summary may be removed to the Committee's office and all
the staff notes will be destroyed. You may check the summary back
to the original documents as extensively as necessary, in Room 4171.

Page 3, Paragraph 2: 2, Subsection B. Materials have already
been ‘tranemitted regarding the Krart-matter and the agreement between
his attorney and the Attorney General. When you have reviewed those
materials, and have contacted Mr. Kraft's attomey, should you deem
that appropriate, I understand you will contiact me if further infor-
mation is requested.

Page 5, Paragraph 3, A & B. ALL of the materials related

to the électronic surveillance of Dr. King, in the custody of the
FBI, will be made available to you-and your appropriately cleared
staff under the same conditions and-with the same agreements as
specified above with regard to the "Kissinger 17" surveillance.

Page 6, Paragraph 4. Those materials in the custody of the
FBI which reflect and relate to electronic surveillance of the
Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City in August 1964,
will be provided under the same conditions as articulated above ©
with regard to the "Kissinger 17" surveillance.

Page 9, Paragraph Cc. A sumnary of procedures for mail
covers has been provided by my recent letter to you. In addition
to that, a statistical summary of mail covers on closed matters
will be made available to you in Room 4171, together with access to
the underlying documentation requesting the individual mail covers.

Documentation relating to the opening of mail will be with-
held at present, due to ongoing investigations.

After your review of the mail cover summaries and any
underlying documents you wish to review, we will discuss any
further access which you may request to mail cover information.

Page 10, Paragraph E. I understand and accept your expla-
nation that the word "implementation" in line 2 of paragraph E(1)
does not seek access to the "raw" files of COINTELPRO programs.
All of the memoranda originating the several COINTELPRO programs
will be made available to you and your appropriately cleared staff

for review in Room 4171.

We will furnish to you, for your study at Senate Select
Committee offices, a complete set of the excised exhibits A-E to
the Petersen Report; as previously agreed, your staff may have
access to any unexcised pages of Exhibits A-E which you may wish
to see, and which will be maintained at Room 4171. The back up
materials underlying any particular summery in A-E will be extracted
from the "raw'' files upon your request and made available to you for
your study in Room 4171. General access to the "raw" files is not
required, as I understand it, for your purposes under this agreement.

Page 14, Item I. This will confirm your understanding that
the Huston Plan documents prepared by the Bureau in response to
your request under this heading have been delivered to the White
House for "third agency clearance". This statement formally
confirms my previous discussions with you of this fact when we
met with Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers on July 2. Be advised that
the documents which have been transmitted to the White House for
clearance will be forwarded to you, or made available for access,
if appropriate, upon our receipt of the White House directions.

Page 16, Paragraph J. This will confirm our understanding
that on July 14, there will be available for your review in Room
4171, a 160 page summary document reflecting an analysis of the
0 & C files.

After you have reviewed that analysis, I will discuss with
you an appropriate further step with regard to the 0 & C files if
such is indicated; such an agreement would be generally similar
in tems to the foregoing arrangements.

I trust that this letter accurately reflects our understanding
as reached in our discussion on July ll. If it does not, your
inmediate. advice to me of any particulars in which we disagree in
our understanding will be appreciated. In the meantime, I have
furnished a copy of this letter to the Attorney General and the
Deputy Attorney General and have requested the Bureau's cooperation
in promptly making available the information indicated.

I would appreciate meeting with you and Mr. Schwarz and
Mr. Smothers around July 18, for the purpose of discussing any
problems which you may have identified and to clarify any out-
standing documentary request which you may have, and to agree upon
an appropriate schedule. Since we have received six additional
requests from you, since the July 9, letter was delivered, it would
seem appropriate to re-enalyze your “requirenents in light of the
agreements reached on July ll.

There is a conspiracy underway in cur country. It is a cynical
attempt by a small group of men to advance their own interests+ and the
interests of theiv backers~ by a deliberate subversion of the American
political process, Bit by bit, it.is becoming knowr. The pattern is
emerging. It's core is Watergate, but it spans all of Nixon's time in
office and involves people from coast to coast. Now it will focus in
Gainesville, Florida,

“Gn July 17th, the government will start the trial of the Gainesville
8 on charges of conspiring to violently discupt the 1972 Republican
National Convention. All are members of Vietnam Era Veterans Against
the War/Winter Soldier Organization. Sevea of them served honorably
in Vietnam, They were corpsmen, door gunners, artillery FO's, tank
‘crewmen and intelligence specialists. One was an officer. They were
indicted for doing no more than seeking to ¢212 the truth about what
réally Went on in Vietnam~ truth the government is termined to
suppress, Here are the facts behind the trial of the Gainesville 8:
at ‘ ALL INFORMATION Co)
CLASSIFIEDS

Senate testimony reveals
that the government is
attempting to portray VVAW/
WSO as a violence~prone $
group of dangerous radicals,
By this, they seek to
"justify! the Watergate
break-in and the rest of
their political espionage.
Tf VVAW is dangerous, it
ds because the truth is
dangerous,

“RACT~ James NcCord's recent

. ; . a young people show © 7
“BACT~ The government's feestescte » that.wonderfel enthactoom? :, .’
ease rests on the :
testimony of one William : :
Lemmer, an ex~paratrooper with severe psychiatric problems. He is
just as much a casualty of the war as if he had been struck by a bullet.
“Knowing of his problems, the FBI tracked him down, set him up to be
) busted and then turned hin against his brothers, The FBI skillfully
played on his paranoia and nightmares to turn him into both an informer
and a provacateur, Most of the violence mentioned in the indictments
-Was proposed by Lemmer and rejected by the defendants,
&

FACT~ Pablo Manuel Fernandez, an associate of two of the Watergate
ériminals, approached some of the Gainseville vets and offered to sell
them weapons, At the time, he was on the payroll of the Miami police

and the FRI, Fernandez was told that tho vets would be used for the
purpose of “embarrassing the Democrats." One of the heaviest counts
the Gainesville brothers face is a charge of attempting to acquire

weapons based on this incident,

“BACT- The federal prosecution team in the trial is led by Guy Goodwin.
He personally handled the. Chicago and Harrisburg conspiracy cases. He
works in the Justice Department's Internal Security Division- the heart
of Nixon's dirty tricks-activity. When the indictments were prepared,
his: boss was Asst. Attorney General..Robert Mardian, a right-wing fanatic
who, even J. Edgar Hoover distrusted, Shortly after that, Mardian took
@ position on:.the Committee to Re-elect the President under a friend -
John Mitchell,

FACT- The government deliberately tried to push VVAW/Winter Soldier

intd violence during the conventions. Yet, our demonstrations there~ e
as all of our activities~ were marked by a spirit of discipline and

unity. We stand on our record as a non-violent anti-war group.

FACT~ Perhaps the most outrageous aspect of the government's Gaines-
ville case is the attempt to make the public believe that a small group
of anti-war veterans would attack the Miami police, the Florida State
Highway Patrol, the National Guard, the 82nd Airborne Division and the
Marines with slingshots, crossbows and fried marbles, Rarely has the
government's contempt for. the intelligence of the American people been
so Clearly shown,

In order for the government to effectively disrupt the anti-war
movement, it was not essential for them to win in court. The conspiracy
laws. make it possible for them to charge ‘people when no crimes have

“actually been committed. The government has ,cynically used these laws
to discredit their political opposition, to tie them up in lengthy and
complex court proceedings, and to create.an atmosphere of paranoia in
the country. Even when acquitted, defendants are kept-from doing ‘more
important work and their supporters are tied up in fund-raising and
defense work, Whatever the verdict, the government has already accom-
plished this with the Gainesville 8, This case is different, however,

’ Since the Watergate disclosures, Nixon's cronies will fight like cor-~
nered rats to get a conviction in order to vindicate themselves and 5)
to justify their subversion and distortion of justice. They cannot be
allowed to continue their lies and deceptions, :

What can be done? A local defense effort is Ghdcrway! In addition,

there will be a week of nationally-aimed demonstrations in Gainesville

the week the trial starts. Funds and assistance are needed, If you

can help, contact the VVAW/Winter Soldier storefront at 363 Connecticut
-§t,, or send donations to P,0, Box 902 Ellicott Station, Buffalo 14205.
Now is not the time for cynicism or apathy. Gainesville may well be
the most important conspiracy case yet to be tried. Join the people's
conspiracy for ne Gainesville 8 and commit the crime of spreading the
trut e .

San Francisco, June 12 - Pat Chenoweth, acqused by the Navy of com-
mitting $980,000 of damage to the Ranger and delaying its departure
to Vietnam by three and a half months, was acquitted after a.six
day court martial. The evidence against Pat was hearsay and the
Navy had tried to hold the court martial in the Philipines to insure
a conviction. Besides the incident Pat was charged with, the pro-
ceedings revealed that two dozen other acts of sabotage took place
on the Ranger in a five month period of 1972. He was refused bail
from the beginning and spent ten and a half months in the brig.

WVAW/WSO Newsletter & Meeting Notification

Dear Brothers & Sisters- eee 7

The next general meeting of VVAW/WSO is Saturda’ » August 25th at
12 noon. The place is the Storefront on 363 Connecticut Street, If
you haven't seen the Storefront yet, this could be a good time. It's
where the big black on white sign says "Veteran's Self-Help Center."

We need any feedback we can get as to whether or not you've been
getting these mailings on time for meetings and events. We had the
picnic last month, and a general meeting. right after that, and we
found that 9 out of 10 members we talked to didn't get their mailing
until after at least the picnic. We got the mailing out on Tuesday A.M.
prior to the picnic on Sunday. This has béen happening more and more.
Either the post office is totally breaking down-or our mail is being
singled: out and delayed. Let us. know how often. you get maifings,
when and whether you think-yours might have been tampered with.

A lot of members have. stated that they want to become more active

‘but can’t always make the general meetings. Under the nore or less
autonomous committee structure we have now, you can work on a committee
that most closely reflects your interests. Committees in need of people
are Fund Raising: Veterans’ Affairs; Community Action, Political Educa-
tion; and Amnesty/Anti-militarism. We also need-people willing to sell
"Winter Soldier". downtown in the mornings. And we also need people to
pitch in with some of the shitwork like mailings and: correcting
addresses, etc. If you'can.work in any of these areas, contact us

. and we'll put the right people.in touch.

-o-"Winter Soldier"; the-national VVAW/WSO ‘paper ‘is a iion'thly that's
in it's fifth issue now. We haven't had the bread to send every local
member a copy, but we hope to soon. Meanwhile, we have back copies of
every issue at the storefront. . : oa : :

‘The Attica Defense Committee will ‘be leading the community in-a
-series of events to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of the Attica up-
‘vising and massacre. The degree to which we will participate will
be discussed at the meeting. Tentative schedule:

Sept. 9th, Sun.~ parties to celebrate takeover

Sept. 10, 11, 12- workshops in community. Possibly one to be
held in the Storefront.

Sept. 13, Thurs.~ mass demo and rally downtown.

Everyone is urged to participate as an individual and in whatever
organizational activity is decided upon. Also, a VVAW/WSO national
coordinator may be in town then, so it will be a good chance to get
a sense of the national strength and de hig of the organigation.

Film and Speaker: In conjunction with the activities planned for the
second anniversary of the Attica uprising, we will have a film about
Attica and one of the Attica Brothers will speak on what happened at
Attica as well as defense efforts being made on their behalf. This
will be at the Storefront on Tuesday, Sept. 11 at 7:30.

Gainesville

About the biggest thing VVAW/WSO faced since the signing of the peace
accords last January has been the Gainesville 8 conspiracy trial.
Almost every mailing this year has said something about it. To many of
us, .though, they may still seem kind of remote. Nine members from
this chapter were in Gainesville from July 30 to August 5 for the
national VVAW/WSO demonstrations and three of us got to spend a day in
court and hear the opening statements.

.. The demos were a little smaller than we'd hoped for, but we were all
impressed by the high degree of solidarity showed theré and the unity
of purpose. VVAW/WSO, as recently as a year ago, wasn't much more
than a name a lot of vets adhered to.--It described a condition. Now’ -
it's really an organization. Sometimes we feel a little isolated and
wonder what's coming down in this country and it would be: good to re-
member this. We mentioned "Winter Soldier" earlier in this newsletter.
That's new this year. Another project is Operation County Fair.
VVAW/WSO members are helping to build a community medical clinic-
and to train people to staff it- in an extreme poverty. area of Alabama.
The idea came out of some contacts made last year at the demos around
the Republican convention. In fact, food and medical supplies left « .
over from the Gainesville demo went to County Fair.Another project is
the NOSCAM project out of the Ohio region. It's directed at active duty’
. GI's and publishes "Camp News." Another is the PVS Clearing House in
Milwaukee for the dissemination of PVS info to chapters. Also the VA —
Clearing House in: Chicago. VVAW/WSO is alSd-in the forefront of the" *
“amnesty movement.

We could go on, but’ the point is we're.no longer a loose handful of
people - we're.an organization. that's growing and that's starting to
get into some serious activity. Too often brothers and sisters aren't
‘aware of what's going on in the rest of the country. In future news-
‘letters, we'll try to include information: about some of these projects.

Dear Bill:

Enclosed are several documents referred to by Mr. Colson
and myself in the courseof his recent sworn deposition at your
office. In each case, what is provided is a typed version
of my rougk handwritten notes. Those notes were prepared by
me approximately a year ago, when I was given access to the
underlying documents by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force
in the course of pretrial discovery in United States v..Ehrlich-
man, et. al.

The documents are as follows:

uaa Several FBI memos and reports concerning Leonard
Boudin. The text of the first report (dated July 6,
1971) indicates that derogatory information about Mr.
Boudin had been furnished by the FBI to Ray McHugh

of the Copley News Service. Although I do not have a
copy, there exists in Mr. Colson's White House files
‘a memorandum from John Dean ta Charles Colson, dated
July 20, 1971, transmitting to Colson a copy of McHugh's
article. As you know, Mr. Colson served seven months
in prison for furnishing to Jerry terHorst a report on
Mr. Boudin prepared by Howard Hunt from these FBI
materials.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Mx. Jamas Dick of your Staff has made available for
review testimony which was taken by the Select Comaittee to
Study Governmental Oparations With Respect to Tntelligence
Activities on Friday, October 24, 1975. ‘Together with two
7 other officials and one former official of the FBI, I testified
at that Session,

ta reviewing the transcript of the testioony, I have
noted that on page 1251, lines 24 and 25, in response te a
question by Senator Richard S. Schweiker, I vesponded, “ell,
of the eight FOI projects, I don't recall any where wa had a
list of names, as such." Thereafter, I addressed mysel£ to
questions propounded by Senator Schweiker with. respect to
certain of these projects in San Francisco and explained

they were operated. ENCLOSURES

Tn order that the record may be entirely correct,
I would like to advise you that among thea eight FSI projects
to which I referred, there ware at Idast two not oparated in
San Pvancisco where lists of names were utilized. These Lists
were made up of individuals abroad at addrasses used as mail
drops by hostile Sake intelligence services. In some cases

At 3:42 p.m. on November 10, 1975, Miss Helen W. Gandy
formerly the Secretary to the Director, telephonically advised me that she
had been called by Mary DeOreo who requested an interview at 3:00 p.m.
on Tuesday, November 11,1975, at Miss Gandy’s apartment. Miss DeOreo
said that she would be accompanied by Mark Gitenstein and a court reporter.
She said that Miss DeOreo indicated that representatives of the FBI would not
be permitted to be present during the interview, however, she was not
concerned about that because she felt that she did not feel the need to have
anyone present and she did not desire to have counsel. ¢

I advised Miss Gandy that she could consider the employment _/

interview which Miss DeOreo described as concerning only Director

office is located at Room 4512 in the Pan Am Building in New York City,
called at 3:19 p.m. on November 5, 1975. Mr. Wick said that he had been}
called at 11:35 a.m. on October 31, 1975, by an individual identifying
himself as Mike Epstein representing the Senate Select Committee.
Epstein requested him to come to Washington for a two to three hour
interview concerning a matter relating to his "employment. "' Epstein

did not further describe the subject matter of the interview. An appoint~
ment was arranged for 10:00 a.m. on November 7, 1975.

Mr. Wick said that he was uncertain as to the probable subject
matter of the interview because other matters coming within his responsibilities
at Pan Am which were unrelated to the FBI have been of recent interest to the
Committee. He asked that he be furnished with advice concerning this matter.

At my request, SA Daly telephonically contacted Epstein and
determined that the subject matter of the interview of Mr. Wick wou:
"Martin cal King, Jr.”

I called Mr. Wick at 5:00 p.m. on November 5, 1975, and advised
him that we learned that the subject matter of the requested interview would
be "Martin Luther King, Jr."' I told Mr. Wick that under the arrangements
existing with the Senate Select Committee, it would be appropriate for me
to release him from his secrecy agreement with the FBI for the interview
requested by Epstein. I further advised him of the need to avoid discussion
of matters that may pertain to pending ben information derived

relating to the Soviet Union and other hostile communist countries
indicating the importance attached by the State Department and the
intelligence community to the information obtained through this
operation. A photograph depicting one of these sources in conference
with Soviet Communist Party Chairman Brezhnev was exhibited only
to the Senator, Although the names of the sources were not men-
tioned, I clearly pointed out that the information being disclosed
through this briefing could pinpoint the identity of the informants and,
if compromised, could be disastrous to our intelligence interests and
possibly result in personal jeopardy to the sources,

Inspector Leavitt briefly mentioned his recent meeting
with the sources and their concern for the security of their operations.
Supervisor Ryan furnished a general overview of the financial apparatus
of the Communist Party, USA, including its secret character, cover
company operations, and control by the Soviets, tying this informa-
tion into the relationship of the sensitive sources with Stanley David
Levison, the advisor to the late Martin Luther King, Jr.
Supervisor Phillips set forth in detail the relationship of Levison
and King, emphasizing our first-hand information received either
directly by the sources or through Lem Harris indicating King was
under the influence if not the control of secret Communist Party
member Levison, Supervisor Steinbeck advised of the continuing
liaison function of these sources between the Soviets and the Communist
Party, USA, Soviet funding of the Party through the informants and
also highlighted the sensitive nature of the operation, Many questions
of the SSC staff members were candidly answered,

Memorandum to Mr. J, B, Adams
Re: Senstudy 75
62- 116395

Senator Church expressed appreciation for the thorough
oriefing and stated he believed there was adequate basis for the FBI
to reasonably conclude certain advisors and close associates of King
were affiliated with the Communist Party and undoubtedly influencing
King. He expressed his belief it was the responsibility of the FBI to
determine the extent of communist or Soviet control or influence of
King, but that he was disturbed that in the course of this coverage an
attempt was made to publicly discredit King, He said he questioned
whether the FBI as a law enforcement agency was acting within its
proper scope in publicly discrediting King. He said it was his view
and concern that such activities placed the Bureau directly involved’
“in.'. the political process where it does not belong,

Senator Church stated he had viewed one FBI document
which indicated an effort within the FBI to cultivate a new responsible
leader of the black movement and he characterized this as political
involvement which he considered highly improper,

Senator Church stated he wished it was possible for the
[American people to be aware of the extent to which the Soviets were
funding the Communist Party, USA, He said this is something the
‘people should know and he regretted this could not be done under
circumstances which would not undermine the Bureau's work and
responsibilities. He promised his Committee would be as protective
as possible regarding the sensitive information provided and that he
‘would insure that there would be no public hearings which would
betray the identities of the sources,

briefly the inventory of the documents removed from
Mr. Sullivan's office. He indicated-that it would appear
that a great number of these documents have already been
made available to the Committee through other requests.
He did note, however, that he observed a description of

he may make a.request for delivery of all documents (properly

Although Mr. Katzenbach does not question the validity of

that his recollection of his activities on the dates in question

SENSTUDY 75 : Mee: ip
16 Director So

At his request Deputy Associate Director: James B. Adams
and SA Paul V. Daly of this Division met with Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral Harold R. Tyler, Jx., om October 3, 1975. Mr. “Tyler advised -
that he had shown former Attorney General. Nicholas deB. Katzenbach,
the original Bureau memoranda captioned "Martin Luther King" dated
5/17/65, 10/19/65 and 12/12/65 pertaining to authorization for
microphone surveilance on Martin Luther King. He was also shown a
note dated 12/10/65 directed from him'to Mr. Hoover with his initials
affixed at the bottom thereof. Mr. Tyler related that Katzenbach,
after reviewing the aforementioned documents, stated that it was ~-_
doubtful that he had approved the microphone surveillances contained
in the memoranda, although he admitted the initials looked like his
own. Katzenbach advanced two arguments as to why he did not Saeed
he had approved the electronic surveillance requests. aan

(1) He stated the Martin Luther King investigation was a
very. controversial topic and he was very concerned about it. Accord~-
ing to Mr. Tyler, Katzenbach stated he was so concerned about this
matter that he had discussed it with the President..-In view of his
concern, Katzenbach stated that if he had approved such requests for
electronic surveillance he would have certainly have recalled doing . :
so and he had no such recollection. i

(2) Katzenbach stated it was not his policy to give ~
after-the-fact approval to electronic surveillance requests.. (The
aforementioned memoranda were all requests for electronic surveil-
lance dated after the surveillance was. utilized.) Katzenbach- in-
formed Mr.. Tyler that he had reviewed his diary and on at least one -
of the occasions when electronic surveillance was used, he was avail-
able to approve prior to the use of the device and, therefore, there

would have been no need for after-the-fact ratification of the
electronic surveil lance. :

Legal Counsel to Mr.. Adams
RE: | SENSTUDY. 75

" Katzenbach, according to Mr. tyler, was shown ‘the
Xeroxes. of the aforementioned documents by the Senate Select -
‘Committees during interview by that-Committee apparently per-
taining to his authorization. of electronic surveillance. on
Martin Luther King.

. It was. pointed out by Mr. Adams that former Attorney
General Katzenbach in a memorandum dated 9/27/65 captioned:
"Special Investigative Techniques” thateke stated, in part,.
. concerning wiretaps and mi crophones "It is my understanding
that such devices will.not be used without my authorization, -
- although in emergency circumstances they may be used subj ect -

to my later ratification."

Mr. Tyler stated that Katzenbach ‘had. not” eee this _
particular communication and that he, Tyler, did not know that such .
a communication existed. Mr. Tyler Stated that he and the Attorney
General had indicated to Katzenbach that’in order to clear up this .
question it would probably be necessary that he submit to interview
‘and that certain investigations be conducted: Mr. Tyler mentioned :
particularly that handwriting examinations might be necessary -to

7 verify the authenticity of the initials affixed to the documents
| in question. Mr. Tyler stated he would send the Bureau a memorandum
requesting a certain investigation to. clarify this question.

: During the-course of a contact on another matter with
ae eee ‘Brooks, Chairman of the Government Operations
Commitiee, he advised that he had seen Mr. Kelley's letter to
Chairwoman Abzug regarding the proposed testimony of Joe R. Craig
in which the Director indicated he could not grant the request for testimony. AN
Congressman Brooks described this as nonsense and said that the Director w
is treading on dangerous grounds because he in effect is defying a Committee
of Congress. He said it would be different if the FBI was investigating

Craig on 2 criminal matter because in that case the Congress would rf
back off. He said that if he had received such a letter, he would likely
call the Director to testify. aN

When I learned of this contact, I made arrangements to speak
with Congressman Brooks and he returned my call at 5:00 p.m. on
October 23, 1975. I told Congressman Brooks that I wanted to be sure
he understood the true circumstances and I explained to him that the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice was conducting an inquiry
concerning the matters about which Mr. Craig was called to testify and
that the FBi was not conducting the inquiry. I further explained that
because of the Criminal Division inquiry, the Bureau had been advised by the 6
Department that the Attormey General's policy was that where the subject matter
of the testimony pertains to a matter under active investigation by the Criminal
Division of the Department, requests for testimony should be declined,

Congressman Brooks said that he misunderstood the
circumstances when he saw the letter addressed to Mrs. Abzug. He
aid he did not haye a copy of the letter, but bad only read it. He said -
jthat the Department should assume the responsibility for declining to
provide witnesses called by Committees of Congress if the declination
is based on Department policy. He said that the Committee would then
deal directly with the Attorney General.

:Congressman Brooks said that even should the Attorney
General instruct witnesses specifically not to appear, the Committee would
Still insist on their appearance unless the individual was under indictment
cor unless a criminal case was actually pending.

" Congressman Brooks asked me if we had explained to
Ses. Abzug the circumstances of the Criminal Division inquiry and the
-consequent restrictions on the FBI due to Department policy. I told him
that we had called Mrs. Abzug last evening, October 22, 1975, and explained
the circumstances to her. Congressman Brooks said that he would discuss
dhis mattér with Mrs. Abzug but he felt that the subpoenas requested by her
subcommittee would be approved and issued for the appearance of Mr. Craig.

Dear Mike: : i
This is a foliow-up to ee ee
7, 1975, concerning our proposed format and witnesses for
public hearings on the FBY"S use of informantS"and sources

in’ th the in intelligence area.

The date for that hearing is now scheduled for
Tuesday, December 2, 1975, rather than December 4 and 5, as
indicated earlier.

Also, with regard to the hearing format, in addi-
tion to the appearance that we have discussed with Bureau
representatives of three former FBI informants (Rowe, Hardy,
and Cook) and Bureau representatives (who would discuss the
overall Bureau use of informants), we are planning to hear
testimony from the handling agents and other FBI field per-

|sonnel involved with the three former informants indicaéed
above. My letter of November 7 requested these field p
nel be made available for interviews and possible depositio.
and I understand the necessary clearances and procedures
nearing completion for this.

Dear Bill:

Enclosed are several documents referred to by Mr. ‘Colson
and myself in the courseof his recent sworn deposition at your
office. In each case, what is provided is a typed version
of my rough handwritten notes. Those notes were prepared by
me approximately a year ago, when I was given access to the~
underlying documents by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force
in the course of pretrial discovery in United States v. Ehrlich-
man, et. al.

: The documents are as follows:

ae Several FBI memos and reports concerning Leonard
Boudin. The text of the first report (dated July 6,
1971) indicates that derogatory information about Mr.
Boudin had been furnished by the FBI to Ray McHugh

of the Copley News Service. Although I do not have a
copy, there exists in Mr. Colson's White House files

a memorandum from John Dean to Charles Colson, dated
July 20, 1971, transmitting to Colson a copy of McHugh's
article. As you know, Mr. Colson served seven months
in prison for furnishing to Jerry terHorst a report on
Mr. Boudin prepared by Howard Hunt from these FBI
materials.

MLLo ;

Attached letter to the Attorney General responds
to request received from Department, dated 10/17/75, with
reference to a letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairman,
Senate Select Committee (SSC), to the Attorney General,
dated 10/15/75 (copy also attached), Senator Church's
letter, in summary, proposes that SSC Staff conduct interviews
with nine FBI confidential sources in connection with
activities of the sources on behalf of the FBI in our
=e operations, The Senator indicated to the Attorney

eneral that he hoped there would be no objection to such
interviews but if objections were evident he desired to be
icontacted by Tuesday, 10/21/75.

This is not a new issue. During August, 1975,

SSC Staff Member John T, ELLiff proposed interviews of this
type which were objected to on the principde of the FBI's
obligation to protect the confidentiality of our relationshij
with any source whether that confidentiality be implied or
expressed. The Director, at that time, strongly supporté
this principlé of confidentiality and the issue was take:
the Attorney General, At a conference between the Attorney
General and Senator Church on the evening of 8/14/75, it was

reed that the Committee would attempt a limited mumber of

tterviews of individuals whose identities and/or relationship
ith the FBI had been protected. However, as a condition
recedent to such interviews, the FBI was to be allowed to
‘contact such individuals to inform them of the proposed
interview and to determine whether each would be receptive
po such an interview, Senator Church concurred in this

\o arrangement; however, subsequently on 8/18/75, Elliff advised
that Senator Church hagNteconsidered his agreement with zhe

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Attorney General to the aforementioned procedures as a result
of persuasion by SSC Staff. Elliff, at that time, indicated
a letter recording Senator Church's change of attitude had
been drafted. To date, no such formal acknowledgement has
been received and no interviews have been attempted in the
interim, :

By his most recent communication, 10/15/75, Senator
Church again raises this issue, Although he does note that
ithe matter was originally discussed with the Attorney General
"some weeks ago," he makes no mention of the agreement with
the Attorney General at that time. Apparently, as some sort
of precedent, he does cite the fact that the FBI did make
available for use and interview the names of Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) personnel who coo» énated with the FBI in
certain COINTELPRO activities. We do not consider this action
ion our part to be a concession with respect to confidentiality
lof sources since we specifically stipulated that we considered
IRS personnel to be U. S. Government officials acting in their
apacity as such.,

OBSERVATIONS :

Obviously, the SSC has not given up on this issue.
It is just as obvious that no valid issues have arisen which
should cause us to modify the position taken by the Director
and the Attorney General concerning the confidentiality,
implied or expressed, of our relationships with sources
cooperating with the FBI.

’ Dear Mr.’ Attorney General:

The Select Committee is presently investigating the.
activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried |
on as part of the COINTELPRO program. We appreciate the
cooperation of the FBI and the Justice Department in |
making materials available to us in this area. However,
one problem remains to be resolved. The Committee believes
its staff must contact and interview certain Persons who |
received information from the FBI in the- course: of.
COINTELPRO operations. The FBI has withheld the names of
such persons from the Committee" s use on the grounds that .
_they were FBI "sources" ;

. “The Committee wishes to stress that it is not inter-

“ested in ‘questioning these persons about any role as a
"source", but rather as a recipient of information from

-:the FBI. ‘Indeed, in many instances we would not have been
aware that the individual was a “source” had not the FAI
excised the name from the materials delivered to us.
Nevertheless, to minimize any incidental, deleterious effects
on legitimate FBI operations, the Committee has selected a

..very limited number of persons whom we desire to contact
and interview. (See attached list and materials.)

As you will recall, we originally discussed this
.Miatter with you some weekc age. Since then the Committee
has had an opportunity to consider the issue more fully in :
“the light of our experience with other investigations. - For’
example, our inquiry into the relationships between the
FBI and the Internal ‘Revenue Service clearly showed the

AH: os ?s- Ee

need to use the names’ of IRS personnel who cooperated with

the FBI in certain COINTELPRO activities.
‘were made available to us for our use.

As I am sure you can appreciate, what is at stake. -
here is the-investigation of serious breaches of the :
_. security and confidentiality of information obtained by
-‘the FBI. Such information was apparently disclosed or
"leaked" for the purpose of disruption.
of such disclosures in many of the cases,
. efforts to discredit Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is still
“unknown. Surely, it would be incongruous for an inquiry
into these matters to be impaired on the grounds of the

The full extent
such as the

FBI's interest in preserving confidentiality.

aac The Committee has a clear mandate and a firm commit-
~-' - ment to investigate allegations that the FBI attempted to
- harass and discredit individuals. The integrity of this
investigation depends upon our ability to conduc
views with n0ut the appearance of outside interference.
Therefore, we hope you have no objection to our conducting —
the interviews of the persons on the attached list, but if
October 21.

you do, Please contact me by aa

"Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Lote

I would like to bring to your - personal attention
a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to
establish the relevant facts with respect to one of the
areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inquiry.
Pursuant to S. Res. 21, Peete E 4

I have been informed by the staff that numerous
materials which have been requested during the past several
weeks which pertain to tne rBi‘s activities witn respect to
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., have been withheld from the-
Committee by the Department because of concern expressed
by Mr. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and
estate, as to the appropriateness of the Department's
"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations

«monitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King.

' . Upon’ reviewing the lists of materials requested,
I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could
conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,
especially in view of the fact that our letters of request
have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-
teeth should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to
place the Committee formally on record as reafiirming all.of
the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King
matters, with the limited exception of (1) Mr. DeLoach's
August 24 - 27, 1964 memoranda which pértain’to the 4

- Delivery is requested by Wednesday, September 3,
1975, pursuant to the provisions of the general procedural
agreement between the Department and the Committee which
governs all Committee requests. I understand that the
Bureau has been collecting the King-related materials upon ’
receipt of each of our requests, and therefore I presume
that there will be no substantial burden in meeting the
i September 3, date. : ; .

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

Dick was advised that the bulk of data received
from NSA was provided on a determination by NSA that it would
be of FBI interest rather than in response to a specific
FBI request; that NSA was selective concerning the deta
provided, realizing the FBI was not equipped, manpower-wise,
or in communications areas to absorb the voluminous distribution
by NSA to other agencies: Central Intelligence Agency,
Defense Intelligence Agency, etc., and was primarily responsible
and interested only in veta of security or counterintelligence
value. :

Dick was advised that data received from NSA of
a comminications intelligence nature and so classified
would not appear in an investigative case file, but received
special handling. Much of such data was destroyed following
an evaluation by the desk supervisor, end if retained, was
maintained in a special file room under stringent access
controls.

Regarding the Watch Lists, Dick asked if the Bureau
submitted any lists to NSA or made any requests subsequent
to Attorney General Richardson's letter instructing that no
such requests be made of NSA without Department approval.

He was advised thet I knaw of no such requests and that NSA
had been advised by the Bureau regarding Richerdson's letter.

Dick asked if I knew of any instance where U. S.
citizens may have appeéred on such lists. I advised that I
could not recall, but speculated that it would be logical
for Black Panthers headquertered in Algeria to be on the list
or known terrorists traveling or residing abroad since the
FBI did have the responsibility for determining any foreign
direction, control or financing of domestic individuals or
organizations.

Dear Mr. Shaheen: |

I want you to know how much I appreciated the
opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other
day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most
helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-
cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you
that we will do everything possi ible to avoid joepardizing
any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific
items set forth in earlier document requests which would ©
presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion
as of various dates in 1962, 1963 and 1964 that Stanley
Levison was a “secret member of the Communist Party, USA."
Of course in the event that there is no particular document

7 in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to
the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us ‘neh
so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that kee
context. Finally, of course, we stiil need unexcised copies
‘of the February 22 and June i2, 1962 communications from
New York which appear to have been the fahren appre eaeee
for the “cominfil" case.

Once again, I want to thank you for your time and
I look forward to hearing from you f; fig ve this eee

Dear Mike:

By letter of July 28, 1975, the Senate Select
i Committee requested delivery of "materials pertaining to
the reported investigation of columnist Joseph Kraft in
1969, other than the 'logs' of any surveillance" (Part
TII-A).

su On October 22, 1975, the SSC received a portion
of these materials. Numerous serials in the FBI file on
surveillance of Mr. Kraft were not included in the materials
received, however, apparently because of a difference in
interpretation of the term "logs." Request for delivery
is specifically made, therefore, for the following serials
(with enclosures and attachments) in FBI file 65-75629:
Serials #1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. ;

Excluded from this request are the logs of any. :
surveillance, by which the SSC means transcripts of overhears.
A memorandum from A. B. Fulton to W. R. Wannall, "Subject:
Lloyd N. Cutler, Attorney for Joseph Kraft," dated June 10,
1975, which was provided to the SSC on October 22, 1975,
notes that "the only transcripts of the overhears ‘which were
located are contained as an enclosure to 65-75629-16." Our
request, therefore, does not encompass this enclosure.
Summaries of information obtained from any surveillance of
Mr. Kraft, however, are specifically included in our request.

7 We are cognizant of the agreement between Mr.
Lule. and the Attorney General with regard to materials
) mck ightaibing to the reported investigation of Joseph Kraft,

nd ouxirequest is made subject to the conditions of this
ea NOW derenant .

Dear Mike:

As a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on- the FBI's
use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like
to make the following requests.

\" As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-

i vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence
: ' informant and source program that could be inserted in

i the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at

: the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to
present to the Select Committee a complete description

of its program and to discuss the issues of particular
interest to the Gommittee members. These include, for
example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,
including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-
ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the
sintelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group: and
3) the program's command and control system, including the
limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant or source is per-
mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-
tglation in the informant area, such as the imposition .

Arete g No permit the Select Committee members to study this

Also I am enclosing requests for documents relating

personnel of the San Diego Office concern-
ing Bureau informants during week of
11/10/75. San Diego telephonically advised
office of Legal Counsel of this request and
were advised that no Bureau personnel should
be made available for interview without
prior authorization from FBI Headquarters.

Contact of Madigan with San Diego
Office was brought to the attention of
John T. EL1if£, Staff Director of the
Domestic Task Force of the Senate Select
Committee and Robert Kelly, Staff Member
of same Committee. They were advised this
was contrary to the understanding between
the Bureau and the Committee. Both agreed
and have informed Madigan that no further
attempts will be made to interview Bureau
personnel in the San Diego Office in the
absence of a specific request of FBI Head-
quarters and approval thereof.

with Mr, Mintz concerning a telephone call Wick had received
from Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Member Michael

in Washington, D. C., for a Staff interview. The memorandum
relates that Epstein told Wick the interview concerned a
matter relating to Wick's employment and that Epstein did

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

questions outside the scope of the indicated subject matter
because the subject matter was all he was cleared from

his confidentiality agreement with the FBI for discussion,

He was also told of the four general privileged areas
concerning which he did not have to answer questions, such

as information relating to sensitive investigative techniques,
information which might identify confidential sources, etc.
Wick offered to mail to the Bureau a statement concerning

the interview and he was thanked by Phillips for this.

Wick made it a point to advise Phillips that he
was rather annoyed at Epstein's approach to him, particularly
that Wick had tried on more than one occasion during the
telephone conversation with Epstein to pry from Epstein the
subject matter of the interview but Epstein persisted in not
advising him.

Daly has advised that, when he called Epstein at
Mr. Mintz's behest, he asked Epstein why he did not tell
Wick the subject matter of the interview and Epstein's reply
was that Wick had not asked him, (It should be noted that,
when Daly had the conversation with Epstein, it was before
Wick's call to Phillips.)

OBSERVATIONS :

The foregoing represents two improprieties on the
part of Epstein, The first concerns the fact that, contrary
to agreed»upon procedures, he contacted Wick prior to advising
the Bureau of his intention to interview Wick. The second
concerns divergent reports to us on the Wick-Epstein conver-
sation. Wick made it absolutely-clear that he pressed
Epstein for specificity as to the subject matter of the

interview and Epstein refused to tell him. Epstein claims
he was not asked by Wick. It is the personal observation
of Phillips that, if he had to choose who to believe, there
is no doubt but that it is Wick.

ACTION:

None. For information and record purposes,

a telephone call from an individual who reported himself (3

a“

as John Lofton, a syndicated writer. Mr. Lofton also
stated fie was a friend of Assistant Director Donald Moore
and I could check his, Mr. Lofton's, credentials with

Mr. Moore. Mr. Lofton stated that he had been provided a
memorandum which had been prepared for Senator Church
apparently by Mr. William Miller, Staff Director of the
Senate Select Committee. According to Mr. Lofton, this
memorandum reported the details of a briefing by Mr. Wannall
and myself which had been provided representatives of the
Select Committee Staff concerning Soviet and Soviet-bloc
activities on Capitol Hill. Mr. Lofton stated that the
memorandum did not back up the statements made by Senator

Goldwater that the Soviets had infiltrated seven to nine
Senate staffs.

According to Mr. Lofton he had first
reported Senator Goldwater's statements.

Mr. Lofton
stated that he was aware that Senator Church's committee

did not favor the FBI and he was therefore seeking my
comment on what was said during the briefing with the
inference that he, Mr. Lofton, intended to balance the
scale. I advised Mr. Lofton that I did not desire to
discuss with him any details of the briefing provided
the Staff members of the Select Committee,

W. A. Branigan to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy

was not true that our Agents did not go on Capitol Hill.
Our Agents were permitted there with the approval of an
Assistant Director. Mr. Lofton requested that I expand
on this position and I suggested that he might desire to
contact Assistant Director Moore for any further contact.

Mr. Lofton subsequently did contact Assistant
Director Moore at which time he again explained that he
had access to a memorandum prepared for Senator Church
iby his staff which recounted the details of a briefing
that had been afforded by the FBI to staff members
concerning the FBI's knowledge of the Soviet infiltration
on Capitol Hill.

ACTION:

If you agree, there is an attached memorandum
to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the contact
made by John Lofton and his statements that he had access
to a memorandum prepared for Senator Church by members of
his staff concerning a briefing which had been given by
representatives of the FBI. It is noted that portions of
this briefing were classified. It is not known whether
the memorandum prepared for Senator Church contained this
classified information. We should advise the Deputy Attorney
General that we are furnishing this for his information and
unless requested by him, we will make no further inquiries
concerning the memorandum of Senate Select Committee
personnel.

NOTE:. During our investigation concerning the device discovered in
the telephone of R. Spencer Oliver at Democratic National Committes _
Headquarters (DNCH), it was learned on 9/28/72 from John G. Stewart,
then Executive Director of the Democratic Policy Council, that Renaenniss
Woolston-Smith, during March or April, 1972, called Stewart con-~
cerning an alleged attempt to compromise the DNCH by the November
Group (the New York based advertising arm of the reelection effort).
No further details were given by Woolston~Smith and no follow-up .-
action was taken by Stewart. Ele
' Our NYO was instructed to and did interview:Woolston-Smith
i on 10/2 and°10/20/72. Woolston-Smith advised that his thoughts
-... about the November Group were totally confined to the realm of ~
i speculation and that he had absolutely no evidence to support his.
conclusion that the November Group was engaged in illegal activi-
ties in addition to advertising. Woolston-Smith had no specific
information and stated most of his information was ‘learned sub— 7
sequent to 6/17/72, the date of the DNCH burglary. He also ad
that-his knowledge of the individuals involved in the Watergate
break-in was acquired after 6/17/72 as was his knowledge of the -
Republican Party buying ‘large quantities of security equipment .i.:
The results of these interviews are included in the New York report:
Gated: 11/20/72 (Bureau file 139~4136), which was disseminated to
the Criminal Division of the Department and the U. Ss. Attorney's -~.
Office, and has. been made available to the Watergate Special A

Dear Mr. Baise:

Iam writing to request from the Department all files within the
possession of tha Federal Bureau of Investigation which relate
in any way to A.J\\Woolston-Smith. As I mentioned in our recent

wt Pa conversation, it is\of vital importance that we obtain this information :
7 as soon as possible because of our pending interview with Mr. Smith.

As you may recall from our previous discussions, I indicated two
specific time sequences wherein it has been established that the
Bureau received reports regarding Mr. Smith, The first of these

is in December 1954 when Smith's name came up in a CIA related
matter in Boston, Massachusetts. The second is on October 6, 1972
when a representative of a foreign nation's intelligence service
provided the FBI with a report on certain activities of Smith. . In
addition to these two specific dates and reports, however, we are
requesting the entire file or files possessed by the FBI on Mr. Smith.

Thanks again for your continued assistance and cooperation.

STATEMENT OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM A, BRANIGAN,
REGARDING INTERVIEW WITH A STAFF MEMBER OF THE
U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

On October 9, 1975, Special Agent William A, Branigan
was interviewed by Mr, James Dick, Staff Member of the U.S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligerce Activities, The
interview, which t.ok place in the office space of the
U.S. Senate, was fully recorded and lasted from approximately
2:15 p.m, until 5:15 p.m. :

At the outset of the interview, Mr, Dick advised
that it was his intention to have an oath administered by
a United States Senator but none such was available,
He advised that SA Branigan would be given the opportunity
to review the record of the interview, and he requested that
SA.Branigan at that time swear an oath before a United States
Senator who would then be available, SA Branigan agreed to
do this, Also at the outset of the hearing, Mr, Dick advised
SA Branigan that it was his right to refuse to answer any
question, that he had the right to counsel, and that at any
time could interrupt the interview for the purpose of consulting
counsel,

Mx. Dick furnished SA Branigan with Kerox copies
of approximately eleven intra~Bureau documents which Mr, Dick
said had been made available to the Committee through the
Department of Justice. During the interview a number of these
documents were made a part of the record,’

Mv. Dick requested that SA Branigan identify and
briefly explain the Bureau's various mail intercept surveys.
When this was accomplished, Mr. Dick directed specific questions
at our survey known as Z Coverage. In answer to his specific
question, Mx, Dick was advised 4 Coverage was instituted in
Washington, D, C., prior to the United States entry into
World War LI, Mr, Dick exhibited a memorandum which had been

-renew the Z Coverage mail program. Mr. Dick was advised that

a rr
a

prepared by former Special Agent E. T, Turner in the mid-1950s
which dealt with a request by the Washington Wield Office to

this memorandum obviously reflected that Z Coverage had been
discontinued at a date sometime before the date of the
memorandum and the program was reinstituted sometime after the
memorandum, Mr. Dick was advised that SA Branigan had no
present recollection as to the specific dates involved.

Mr. Dick was also advised that sometime during the 1950s the
program had been extended to New York and that mai} directed
to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations was the object of
our Z Coverage there.

Mr, Dick inquired if at any time during the operation
of the Z Coverage there was any thought given to legalizing
the coverage. Mr. Branigan advised that he had no recollection
‘of any such effort in this respect. Mr. Dick also inquired
as to the criteria which were used by the Agents who worked
the 2 Coverage in selecting mail for special attention,
He was advised that there were no written criteria, and it was
the recollection of SA Brdnigan that the Agents who worked the
Z Coverage used their own judgment based up@n past experience
developed over an extended period of time im selecting mail
for special attention. :

: With respect to the Sam Survey, Mir. Dick was advised
that operations under the Sam Survey were umdertaken to locate
and identify Soviet illegals operating in the United States,
These operations were begun based on solid knowledge as to how
Soviet illegals were instructed to prepare their correspondence
‘for transmittal to mail-drop locations in Western Europe,
Communications of illegal agents had telltale indicators, both
in the envelopes and the letters themselves, and these indicators
were believed to be still valid and in use by Soviet illegals
at the present time. Mr. Dick was also informed that mail
selected for special attention would have more than one
indicator unless, of course, {t was addressed to a known
mail-drop address in Europe.” Mr. Dick had available a letter
from our New York Office which set forth tke results and the
accomplishments of. the Sam Survey for a particular period.

Mr. Dick referred specifically to information set forth in the
letter concerning the activities of some New Left groups.

He inquired to know why correspondence from ‘these groups was -
selected for special attention if our program was directed at

uncovering Soviet illegals, SA Branigan informed Mr, Dick
that he did not know why this correspondence had been selected
and speculated that the Agents operating the program might
have been aware of the Bureau's investigative interest in these
‘ groups and based upon this awareness had selected the correspondence
: in the hope of furthering the investigation of the groups.
Mr. Dick inquired as to SA Branigan's evaluation of the Sam
t Survey, and he was advised that this Survey was considered highly
Hl productive in that it put the Bureau in a position of identifying
7 Soviet illegals in the United States without reference to any
i other agency or any other source both within and without the
a Soviet intelligence services,

f :
' Mr. Dick inquired concerning the Sun Survey which
i . ’dinvolved the screening of mail directed to known Soviet intelli-
| gence agents who were employed by the United Nations Secretariat,
{ Mr, Dick was advised that this program was again directed at
the detection of illegal agents who might be operating in the
United States, The program was based on indicators which would
appear in the illegals' correspondence, Mr, Dick was informed
that we had not detected any illegals by this program and it
was of limited duration,

During the interview, Mr. Dick asked a number of
questions concerning the level of authority for approval of

‘ mail intercept surveys. He inquired if Mr. Hoover had approved
4 the original memorandum in the Sam Survey. Mr. Dick was advised
oy that based upon W, A. Branigan's review of the file, it did not

appear that this original memorandum had gone to the Director but
certainly subsequent mail that periodically evaluated the program
had been seen and approved by Mr. Hoover, Mr. Dick was also
advised that it was Mr, Branigan's understanding that if a field
office desired to engage in. a mail intercept survey, Bureau
Headquarters approval would be necessary, Mr, Dick had available
a@ communication from our San Francisco Office which indicated that

‘ office had developed a source who had access to mail coming from

} ne Communist China through Canada, It was pointed out to Mr. Dick

: that while this source may have been developed by the San Francisco
Office on their own initiative, Bureau Headquarters was consulted

va and had issued guidelines concerning material reported by the

source, Mr. Dick asked a number of questions concerning mail .
programs directed against mail coming from and going to Communist
China, For the most part, SA Branigan was not familiar with
these programs and was unable to provide positive answers to
the questions posed, :

With respect to Bureau Source 200, also known as
the CIA's Hunter Project, Mr. Dick inquired why the Bureau's
participation in-this was not terminated at the time
Mr. Hoover terminated our other iiail intercept surveys. :
In this regard, SA Branigan advised him that obviously the
Bureau Source 200 Program was not considered in the same
light as the Sam Survey and the other programs. With respect
to Bureau Source 200, the Bureau was merely a recipient of
information provided by another agency, namely, the CIA.
Mr. Dick exhibited a memorandum prepared by SA Br&nigan to
advise then Acting Director Gray that the CIA was proposing
that the Bureau take over the Hunter Project, In answer to :
Mr, Dick's question, he was advised that the Bureau certainly 7
never seriously considered taking: over the Project because i
of its magnitude, the number of personnel that would be : *

_ required to operate the program, and because the CIA themselves

had indicated that the Postal Service feared that there was

a serious threat to the security of the program. Mr. Dick
inquired as to whether the Bureau considered the product from
the Hunter Project as valuable as our Sam Survey. He was
advised that certainly there was no comparison between the
results of the Hunter Project and the results that came from
the Sam Survey. : .

TNTERVIEN BY SSG STAFF MEMBER OF
SPECIAL AGENT (SA) JAMES P. LEE, OCTOBER 10, 1975

On October 10, 1975, James Dick, SSC Staff Member,
interviewed SA James P. Lee of FBE Headquarters (FBIHQ) on the
subject of mail duborcept programs. The interview took place
at the SSG offices in the former Carroll Arms Hotel and began
at. approximately 2:30 p,m. and terminated at approximately
4:15 p.m. Mr. Dick advised SA Lee of his rights in that he was
entitled to be represented by counsel, could refuse to be
interviewed and could refuse to answer any questions. SA Lee
was placed under oath by the stenographer who is a Notary Public
in the District of Columbia since no senator was present.

Mr. Dick advised that when the testimony was transcribed, it
could be reviewed by SA Lea and minor a! es made but any major

wee changes would have to be approved by a senator. Also at that
time, if the Bureau so desired, SA Lee could be sworn in by a
senator.

The questions covered a discussion of the SAM and
GUS Survey programs operated by the FBI (Bureau) between 1958
SQ and 1966; the Hunter Project (Bureau Informant 200), which was
a CIA program operated until May, 19733; and 2 Coverage operated
iS by the Bureau between 1940 and 1966. 7

With regard to the SAM Suxvey, Dick asked when it was
| initiated and when it was stopped. He was furnished with these
dates: 1958 through July, 1966. He noted that one of the items
in his possession, a New York letter dated April 8, 1966, aueat
AO pointed out that the SAM Survey had furnished information on
, Ehe Commmist Party, USA, Lawyers Committee on American Policy
; Towards Vietnam, Youth Against Yar and Fascism, and Pan American
yu Students Organizations in the Americas, Incorporated. Mr. Dick

asked if we developed information on domestic organizations
such as these within the framework of the SAM Survey which was
aimed at detecting illegals. SA Lee pointed out the reason
probably was to determine if there was any Soviet-type influence
in these organizations.

Mr. Dick asked about the Washington Field Office
obtaining letters in another case being directed to a known
mail drop in France from an illegal in the United States.
(The word "France" was excised from the copy in the possession
of Mr. Dick.) Mr. Dick was told that this was a separate case
received from a foreign intelligence source but it was handled
within the framework of the SAM Survey. (This relates to an-
other case which was based on information furnished to the
Bureau by French intelligence.)

Mr. Dick also asked if FBIHQ éxercised control other
than the annual review. He was told that FBIHQ did exercise
control and it was pointed out to him that the Los Angeles
Office had been instructed to discontinue the program due to
unproductivity and to concentraté on other areas of investigative
work to detect illegals. t

Mr. Dick asked what action would be taken if the SAM
Survey developed information showing a violation of criminal
law within our jurisdiction. He was told it probably would have
to be referred to the Division in the FBI handling the criminal
violation involved with all the safeguards against disclosure
of the source and limitation on the use of material explained.
He was told that in the recollection of SA Lee, no such informa-
tien was ever developed.

Mr. Dick asked if justification of the programs was
ever done on a basis less than annual review. He was told on
certain occasions we did if Mr. Hoover or another Bureau
official asked for such a review on a shorter basis..

Mr. Dick made inquiry concerning the origin of the
SAM Survey program and asked if Mr. Hoover was aware of it. He
was told that the program originated in a conference held with
personnel from some of our field offices, including the
New York Office, and FBIHQ personnel. During this conference,

sae”
it was agreed to begin the SAM Survey program and this was

placed in a memorandum reporting the results of the conference

to Mr. Hoover along with the recommendation of the conference ,
to begin the program. This memorandum was approved by Mr. Hoover.
Mr. Dick asked the reasons for the discontinuance of the program
in July, 1966, particularly since Mr. Hoover had approved the
continuation of the program for a- year in the New York Office

and Washington Field Office in April, 1966. Mr. Dick was told
that the reason Mr. Hoover made this decision was not known.

aaa Mr. Dick asked about the GUS Survey and he was told

it involved a review of mail destined for certain postal zones

in New York, Detroit and San Francisco. He was told it wag

based on knowledge gained from our work that we could identify
mail directed to illegals through indicators we knew were used
by Soviet intelligencé officers in communicating with illegals.
He was told we were looking for mail posted in the United States
usually, in the New York or Washington, D. C., area, and directed
to an illegal. The reason for the selection of certain postal
zones was based on the fact that the areas were tiie type in which
an illegal may live; that is, a transient-type population with
hotels, boarding and rooming houses which attract someone

trying to establish himself in the United States. Mr. Dick was
told in response to a question concerning the indicators that
they were still considered to be valid.

Concerning Z Coverage, Mr. Dick pointed out a memorandum
had been prepared in September, 1951, discussing the possibilities
of opening the mail legally. Mr. Dick asked SA Lee whether
any further action had been taken on this matter and he was told
SA Lee had no such knowledge. Mr. Dick asked for the criteria
used in Z Coverage and he was told this was something which
was left to the judgment of the individual Agent who reviewed
the mail and that the Agent would develop a "feel" for his work
and would ignore mail obviously prepared by children or which
appeared to be of a routine business nature. He asked if
SA Lee handled the supervision of this case and was told it
was handled in another unit and that it had commenced in 1940
which was prior to the time SA Lee entered on duty with the
Bureau.

Concerning the Hunter Project, Mr. Dick asked how
information concerning American citizens traveling in Russia
or studying in Russia would be of assistance in locating illegals.
It was pointed out that such individuals could have possibly
been engaged in activities in the Soviet Union which caused
them to be compromised and might have been recruited on the
basis of such compromise. In addition, American students
studying at schools such as Patrice Lumumba University may well
have beén recruited by Soviet intelligence.

Mr. Dick asked why the names of certain individuals
were included on the Hunter Watch List, He specifically
referred to the name Leonard Bemstein. SA Lee informed him
he had no information concerning Bernstein or why his name
was included on the Watch List.

Mr. Dick asked about the details of the offer made
by CIA in February, 1973, to turn the Hunter Project over to the
Bureau. He was told that an appointment was made for a CIA
official to see Mr. L. Patrick Gray III concerning this but no
information was received that the meeting had taken place and,
if so, what transpired. We asked what the feeling of
SA Lee was concerning this offer and it was pointed out that
CLA had informed us there were security problems involved and
for this reason the opinion of SA Lee was that it might not
be wise to take over the project, He asked if SA Lee thought
the programs should be reinstituted and he was told that in
light of its questionable legality. #einstitution would be
questionable. He then asked if the answer would be the same if
the Attorney General approved the reinstitution of the programs
and SA Lee stated that he would favor reinstitution of the
programs under those circumstances since it was believed they
were still valid investigative techniques.
