anyone as far as SWIFT knows. He stated PHYLLIS MC GUIRE
cannot even be sure of GIANCANA's whereabouts at any particular
time. PCI further advised that he had never been in GIANCANA's
company in Las Vegas, Nevada. He stated that GIANCANA was
"persona non grata" in Las Vegas and although he did say to
SWIFT that he sneaked in once in a while he had to stay '
cooped up at whatever friend's place he stayed at and could
not allow himself to be seen, VI :

- the Chi Chi Club: in Palm Springs at this time. “He stated
he does not remember the name of. the Place he stayed at
at that time ashe was only there for a few days. J

SWIFT advised that he had been misunderstood when
questioned on. August 26, 1963. and he told of GIANCANA being.
with FRANK SINATRA, DEAN MARTIN. and EDDIE FISHER at Las Vegas.
This was reported in referenced Miami teletype to Bureau,
8/26/63, U

SWIFT said that last season he was with GIANCANA
when EDDIE FISHER opened at the Eden Rock Hotel on Miami Beach
and FISHER made a big fuss over the subject and sat at his
table. He stated that DEAN MARTIN also acted the same way

when GIANCANA caught his act-last season at Miami Beach. He
stated that SINATRA also seemed to’ afford GIANCANA differential
treatment at the time he saw them together at Palm Springs.
PCI stated he was sorry if he had been misunderstood when
previously interviewed.

It could not be determined if PCI was denying being
with GIANCANA in Las Vegas because of fear of having to testify
to this at some later date or had actually conveyed the wrong
impression innocently when first questioned. , PCI stated he
has not been in Las Vegas since June, 1962, VU

If New York or Las Vegas has any information contrary.
to this, kindly advise Miami so PCI's reliability can be
evaluated. U

. PCI advised that he has never heard of subject
owning any property in the Florida. He advised that he and
subject and PHYLLIS and CHRIS MC GUIRE once visited a house
just below Palm Beach, Fla., during one of GIANCANA's visits
to Fort Lauderdale, which GIANCANA advised that a friend of
‘his had for sale, SWIFT said the house seemed to be worth
about $30,000 but was on an excellent waterfront lot. This
house is apparently the. one owned by LES KRUSE, an associate

- of GIANCANA, and its location has long been known to the
Miami Office.

Contact with PCI SWIFT will be maintained. J
