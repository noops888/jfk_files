PCI BEN SWIFT, Jr. was contacted 11/19/63 by SA

JAMES J. KEARNEY and advised that he had no idea of where

SAM GIANCANA was on 8/12, 13 and 14/63. He advised that when

GIANCANA arrives at a place or leaves he does not confide in

anyone as far as SWIFT knows.

He stated PHYLLIS MC GUIRE

cannot even be sure of GIANCANA'S whereabouts at any particular

time. PCI further advised that he had never been in GIANCANA'S

company in Las Vegas, Nevada.

He stated that GIANCANA was

"persona non grata" in Las Vegas and although he did say

SWIFT that he sneaked in once in a while he had to stay

cooped up at whatever friend's place he stayed at and could

not allow himself to be seen. V

SWIFT said that the last time he, SWIFT, was in

Las Vegas was during the week of 6/11/62 when he stayed by

himself at the Bali Hai Motel across the street from the

Desert Inn. He stated the MC GUIRE sisters were playing

at the Desert Inn at this time.

He said at this time he met

DEAN MARTIN at a party given by JACK CARTER, a comedian then

playing in Las Vegas.

He stated GIANCANA was not present at

this party.

He advised that he was with GIANCANA during Easter

week of 1963 and that he visited at FRANK SINATRA'S house in

Palm Springs, Calif.

He stated the

MC GUIRE sisters were at

the Chi Chi Club in Palm Springs at this time:

He stated

he does not remember the name of the place he stayed at

at that time as he was only there for a few days. y

SWIFT advised that he had been misunderstood when

questioned on August 26,

1963 and he told of GIANCANA being

with FRANK SINATRA, DEAN MARTIN and EDDIE FISHER at Las Vegas.

This was reported in referenced Miami teletype to Bureau,

8/26/63.

U

SWIFT said that last season he was with GIANCANA

when EDDIE FISHER opened at the Eden Rock Hotel on Miami Beach

and FISHER made a big fuss over the subject and sat at his

table.

He stated that DEAN MARTIN also acted the same way

when GIANCANA caught his act last season at Miami Beach.

He

stated that SINATRA also seemed to afford GIANCANA differential

treatment at the time he saw them together at Palm Springs.

PCI stated he was sorry if he had been misunderstood when

previously interviewed. u

It could not be determined if PCI was denying being

with GIANCANA in Las Vegas because of fear of having to testify

to this at some later date or had actually conveyed the wrong

impression innocently when first questioned.

PCI stated he

as not been in Las vegas since June, 1904. 1

If New York or Las Vegas has any information contrary

to this,

kindly advise Miami so PCI's reliability can be

evaluated.

PCI advised that he has never heard of subject.

owning any property in the Florida.

He advised that he and

subject and PHYLLIS and CHRIS MC GUIRE once visited a house

just below Palm Beach, Fla., during one of GIANCANA's visits

to Fort Lauderdale, which GIANCANA advised that a friend of

his had for sale.

SWIFT said the house seemed to be worth

about $30,000 but was on an excellent waterfront lot. This

house is apparently the one owned by LES KRUSE, an associate

Of GIANCANA, and its location has long been known to the

Miami Office.

Contact with PCI SWIFT will be maintained..
