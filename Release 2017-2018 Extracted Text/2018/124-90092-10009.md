confidence and use you as an entree with the

and

other, excellent Bureau

contacts The recommendation was also specifically made, that "due to your

peculiar personality! Horton should be the new Canadian

répresentative.

because of his so-called ability to handle people," meaning of course,

he is expected to cultivate and properly handle you for the, benefit of CIA.

It is therefore quite evident that CIA personnel are not only unfairly

judging you, but also have every intention of using you as a "stepping-Stone

for their own designs.

This infornation is being pointed out to you so that you may be

completely aware of the situation. You should be particularly alert to prevent

being used

as any such "stepping stone" for CIA or Horton. CIA should develop

its own contacts without depending upon the excellent relationships already

established roetween the FBI and Canadian

Aficial channels. Only that liaison

necessary for the coordination of domestic and foreign matters is necessary and

it should be most circumspect.
