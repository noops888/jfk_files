than I and rothing stands or nothing sticks in my mind to

suggest that Dick. said any thing which would be other than

normal, casual conversatior after what was rather a strong

remark by the President. Ind I was a little bit stunned,

needless to say.

Mr. Kirbow. Thank you very much, Mr. Szulc.

MI. Aaron. If we can go onto another subject, Mr. saulc.

from page proofs of a fort coming article in the magazine

there is a suggestion there concerning the involvement of

the Agency in - the Central Intelligence Agency -- in the --

involvement of the Agency after the 1956 Suez War in a program

with Israel.

Can you tall us what that story is about?

Mr. Szulc. The article which is to appear in the Augus*

issue of Penthouse magazine relates in a general fashion for

reasons which I will explain presently, if so desired, the

fact that sometime in tha late 50's subsequent to the Suez lar

of 1956, the CIA had made ¿ vailable to the Israeli goverrmert

technical knowledge, technical assistance, in many fields,

leading to the creation - that was the case at the time

or the development at least: of a nuclear weapon.

Mr. Aaron. Can you trill us how you managed to acquire

the story, what substance there is to it, or in what way the

story can be substantiated

Mr. Szulc. I was tod by one of my news sources that a

situation had occurred in the 1960's in which the CIA delivered

to the Israeli government classified information, technical

knowledge know-how, the services of distinguished physicists and

fissionable material in the form of plutonium to assist in the

development of an Israeli nuclear weapon at the Dimona Israeli

Nuclear Testing Grounds.

I have raised the subject in a private conversation with

Mr. James Angleton in the spring of this year. Mr. Angleton

told me that essentially this information was correct.

Let me backtrack and aid one point.

My original information was indeed the counterintelligerce,

the CI Division of the Central Intelligence Agency, which was

then headed by Mr. Angleton, was the unit in CIA responsihle

for this nuclear operation.. Because of an acquaintantshio

which I have with Mr. Angleton I had the opportunity in a

private conversation to ask him in so many words, can you •

corroborate or confirm that this which I have described took

place and that you and CI ware involved in this.

Angleton said that - he was rather taken aback by this

information - said that, in effect, he could confirm it. with

two corrections.

One, the timeframe was wrong, that it was

not in the early '60's, but indeed in the late '50's after the

Suez War and number two that as far as he was concerned it

was not delivered by him or the CIA or anyone of his knowled.

of any fissionable material such as plutonium or other material.

That all that was made available to the Israeli government

by the CIA as represented, and as represented by CI, the

counterintelligence was classified information, technical

assistance, and the availability of one or more distinguished

nuclear scientists or physicists whose services were available

to the United States government.

I, based on information which I had from my original

source, asked Mr. Angleton whether he could confirm that

a British born scientists whose name, upon investigation.

turns out to be Mann -- M-a-n-n -- first name Wilfred Basil

or Basil Wilfred - again I can correct the record at that -

where MI. Mann, or DI. Manr I should say, was indeed one of

the scientists involved in this operation. Mr. Angleton

confirmed that indeed this was the case.

He cautioned me that any publication of Dr. Mann's

involvement in MI. Angletor's words could be enormously

explosive, damaging to the national security of the United

States, damaging to our intelligence assets and also enormously

dangerous to Dr. Mann pers nally. In effect, Mr. Angleton

said at one point that sholld I surface MI. Mann's name,

Dr. Mann's name, he may go as far as commit suicide.

I asked for an explanition and MI. Angleton told me that

DI. Mann, who was a British citizen at the time, who in the

'50's was part of the joint. U.S.-British nuclear group based

at the British Embassy in lashington, was found by

counterintelligence, by CIA, to have been involved in some way

in one or more espionage situations involving the defection

of McClean and Burgess and subsequently Philby. I asked

Angleton to tell me more about this. He said it was one of

those very complicated double agent situations in which a

decision was made when DI. Yann was still in this country that

he would not be prosecuted, arrested or otherwise exposed and

because the Agency felt that he could be useful or helpful as

a U.S. intelligence asset.

It is further my understanding that D. Mann, who now

resides in Washington, D.C. - or I should say in Chevy Chase,

Maryland, across the state line - is now employed by the u.s.

Bureau of Standards, is an American citizen. According to

Mr. Angleton, his equivalent, the CIA equivalent of a parole

situation which means he's inder surveillance and has to report

at certain intervals to his case officer or his parole officer.

as it were, at the CIA and me repeated that should the story

of Dr. Mann's involvement in those situations, the espionage

situations and the Israeli situation emerge, it could be

enormously damaging to the J.s. national interests, to the

negotiations in the Middle East, to men with our intelligence

arrangements with the British, who I understand have the knowledge

of the U.S. decision not to prosecute Dr. Mann and that in the

end it could even become personally damaging to Dr. Mann to the

point to use Angleton's worls, he might kill himself.

I told Angleton that I would handle the story in the most

careful way, which is the hay in which it appears, or will

appear, in Penthouse magazine. The name is not given. There

is no mention whatsoever of the Burgess-McClean-Philby type

of situations.

Angleton's name is used in the story to corroborate the

material but without direct attribution to Angleton. The

article will say or is saling that sources close to Angleton

confirmed the thrust of the story but disclaimed other allega-

tions, or words to that eflect, that a fissionable material

was made available to the Israeli government.

Mr. Angleton chose not

to go into a question which I

raised with him which was whether this operation was undertaken

with the knowledge and the authorization of the President of

the United States at the time or the National Security Council,

the Atomic Energy Commissin and/or other departments of the

government who would norma: ly be responsible for transfer or

clearance for transfer of classified information in the nuclear

field to a foreign governmint.

MI. Angleton chose no': to discuss this and I therefore was

not in a position to pursu.. this point which obviously was ore

which contains a great dea..

Mr. Schwarz. Did you discuss with Mr. Angleton anything

about -- any question rela:ing to why this was done, assumiro

this was done, if it was done?

the physicists, and did he confirm that that did in fact take

that I understand, can you confirm this or not, because I'm

in a quandry, do I use the story or not, would you comment on

the following information. In other words, do I understand

correctly that the CIA and specifically counterintelligence and

you personally have engaged in making available to the

Israeli's information, know-how, assistance, technical

assistance, manpower, scientists and nuclear materials for

development of nuclear weapons in the early '60's.

This was roughly the way I put it to him. His response

was, being rather taken aback by the question in the first

place, you know, he said, how the hell do you know about this.

and I said, well, you know one hear's things in this town.

and he says well, as long as you know, you might as

well have it straight. Your timeframe was wrong, it wasn't

the early '60's it was the late '50's and decidedly, flatl;.

to the best of my knowledge, there was no delivery of

fissionable material to the Israeli's.

Then my second question was, as I recall, do I understar.!

correctly that Di. Mann was one of the scientists who were

made available to participate in this operation, which be

confirmed, as I mentioned, and then he said, but, did you row

that he had this peculiar tackground to which I referred

earlier.

MI. Kirbow. You referred to him as a double-agent

background?

Mr. Szulc. He didn't ise the word. I think this was

my word to describe him. I think more precisely he did not

use the expression.

Mr. Schwarz. You stated the conversation took place in

the spring, was it April?

Mr. Kirbow.

April of'25

Mr. Szulc. If that's really relevant to you and I can

look at my calendar and give you the precise date of it. It

would have been late March, early April.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, I think it would be relevant if we

want to check it out with anybody else.

Mr. Szulc. That's easy. I can check it out.

Mr. Schwarz. Where did the conversation take place?

Mr. Szulc. It took place in the home of a mutual friend

in the first instance and then it continued at dinner at a

restaurant in Washington.

MI. Schwarz. Dinner in the evening, not lunch?

Mr. Szule. I would say most of the conversation was at

the mutual friend's house and loose ends were wrapped up at

dinner.

Mr. Kirbow. What was the friend's name?

'1r. Aaron. Can we ask a different question?

Nas your mutual friend a party to the conversation?

Mr. Szulc. Yes, ha was present.

The mutual friend is Benjamin wells who is a former

I think in this case the individual

does have evidence. The other individuals were just sources,

and there's a distinction letween this and the other.

Now it seems to me if Mr. Angleton confirms this story

then anybody else's testimony I suppose is irrelevant.

MI. Kirbow. Yes.

I believe that it should be fair to say to you at this

time that if the Committee chose to verify this matter with

Mr. Angleton and he denied the same, then the Committee might

well want to look further and talk with someone else, so I

I make you no promises of what the committee would do. I'm not

I in a position to do that as a staff member. But I think that

would be a matter which they would very carefully consider

along with the regeust that you've made.

Mr. Szulc. The point of the request is essentially that

Angleton and Ben Wells are old and close friends. My

acquaintantship with Angleton is through Ben Wells and in a

way it is a bit of a -- 1t would be a bit of ethical violation.

corroborating witness.

corroborated the fact, only that he was present at the time

Mr. Szulc.: This is why I have a problem of givim you

for obvious reasons. Or i! some agency of the government

in defensive action to go nto detail.

written and the story is to oome out in such detail as I have

Mr. Kirbow. You're telling the Committee then that you

Mr. Szulc. Well, he his sources that are obviously not --

MI. Kirbow. Could you ell us this colleaque's name?

Mr. Szulc. If it is not absolutely necessary, I would

rather skip that one, because again we are in this peculiar

situation without mentioning any details. Angleton's name was

never mentioned in my conversation over lunch with this colleague

so I don't aven know what he knows. He may know just the

general subject.

!

Mr. Aaron. I have one question, the last question for

my part.

Why did you want to tell this story to the Committee?

Mr. Szulc. Two reasons.

As a reporter I do not believe that I can clarify this

matter further than I have because of my own limited resources

I cannot subpoena people, et cetera, et catera. I think it is

an extremely important point to be established in the context

of the whole look into the intelligence community whether this

is or is not the case of the Agency acting outside of

astablished channels of government.

I think it is useful and necessary for the Congress and for

the public opinion at some point somewhere to have knowledoe

of it since I am not able professionally to pursue this any

further, unless someone lands on my doorstep with the information.

I think Angleton is as far as I can go on this in what he

has given me I have written with all the self-imposed restrictions

to which I have referred and I think that nothing is served

by my keeping this in secrecy.

Mr. Aaron. Did anybody working with you make an effort

to contact him?

MI. Szule. No, it was a very deliberate decision on my

part not to go to him because he was described to me as an

elderly gentleman in ill health and if, indeed, with Mr.

Angleton --

(Pause)

I was simply saying that I made a deliberate decision not

to call Dr. Mann because I did not think one, he could be

very helpful to me and I was told by Angleton and other people

that he was an eldarly man in ill health and my calling him

or coming to him saying is it true that you're a spy, is it

true that you worked for the CIA in Israel, is it true you

work for the CIA would unhinge the person and in situations

like this I think most of is have simply to balance what you're

likely to get out of a call of conversation against the

damage that you can inflict on an individual, and I felt that

it was too little to be gained.

and so on, subsequent to which I had a conversation with

Angl-ton which would have teen, as I say, late March or early
