WEEKLI SUMMARY

DALLAS DIVISION

Re Dallas airtel to Bureau, 11/5/62.

RE: GAMBLING IN NATIONAL SPORTS

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE MATTER

(DI 94-190):

On 11/0/02, BLACKIE SHERROD, Sports Editor, "Dallas

Times Herald", and a trusted confidential source of the Dallas

office, advised that he had been able to obtain the films of

the Texas A & M - Houston game played at Houston, 9/29/62.

11/7/62 these films were reviewed by

SA ROBERT M. BARRETT

DON KLOSTERMANN, in charge of player procurement

for the Dallas

Texans professional football league, who had obtained the films

in the normal course of business.

KLOSTERMANN' S

trustworthiness

has been attested to by confidential source PAUL ROTHERMEL, a

former Bureau Agent.

PAUL, ROTHERMEL, and KLOSTERMANN are employed

by the H. L. HUNT family in Dallas.

The results of this review

are being forwarded the Bureau and

Kansas City by separate

communication.

It should be noted

that suspected official

JAMES FORD did call two very close fouls against Texas A & M

in this ballgame, one of which led directly to the only

touchdown scored,

that being by Houston late in the game

and

which gave Houston a 6-3 victory.
