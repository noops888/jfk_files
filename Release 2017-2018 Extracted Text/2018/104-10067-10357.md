his written request for any and all files on de Torres. Mr. Shepanek

pointed out that although there had been an earlier difficulty in locating the

201 on de Torres because of a matronymic/patronymic filing problem, the

HSCA had been given access to all files over a month ago. Mr. Shepanek

acknowledged that third agency documents were inadvertently left in the file

which was provided to HSCA researcher Edwin Lopez.. Mr. Lopez took notes

upon these documents and submitted his notes for review at which time the

error became known. The third agency documents, FBI items, were forwarded

to Mr. Coulson on 28 April (Friday) for FBI review and possible release to

HSCA. Mr. Coulson acknowledged that he had these materials and hoped to

make them available to the Committee at FBI Headquarters immediately

following the meeting•
