She returned to Madrid on 27 March and waited for Guillierno
RUI2 Perez’ return from the Spanish/Cuban Commercial nego-
tiations in Cubs. Sonia departed Madrid for Cuba an 27 March 1970,
it appears thet she intended to travel to Vienna, Austria next,
since several cables were sect to Vienne from Madrid advising
Sonia's travel status. During her stay in Spain, Sonia was in
frequent contact with one Jose Agustin GOYTISOLO ,
Spanish writer in Bercelosa, telephone 228-4063 (Station traces
@¥e OSHA 02585, 17 February 1965; OSBA 02715, 13 August 1967;

3. The pi of Sonia's trip to Madrid was to discuss
the 1970 work plan for the Embassy with the Charge, Guillerno
RUIZ Perez. She also telked with the various Embassy officials,
most probably to familiarize herself with their duties ané to
See if they had any problems. She pitehéd in and helped with
the backlogged work of Orestes BARRED A and Horacio
FUENTES and also helped with the cultural activities.
For instapce, she sent two cables to MINREX ~ one regarding
the forwarding cf movie posters for a March exhibit and another
regarding the forwarding of a Cuban stamp exhibition by end
March.

4. in their discussion of the 1970 work plan Sonia told
RUIZ that they were going to plan the February, March, and
April quarter. She showed him “an agenda fer the control of
planned and unplanned activities” and the general directives of
the plan which included scientific information and political
information, with specific directives (requirements) for Spain.
RUIZ has to prepare for Havane e monthly report, then 4 quarterly
Summary, of the activities accomplished. Sased these
reports the activities of the following quarter will be planned.

a. Im line with the plan of scientific
information, Sonia and RUIZ discussed the pros
and cons of a Comite Cientifico-Tecnico which
is to be set up in Medrid. RUIZ was of the
opinion thet the local (Spanish) Communist
Party would try to infiltrate it and this
would bring problems to the Embassy. Sonia
poiated owt the successes encountered in
Switzerland and Sweden with such a committee
even though at first there were problems
which vere later overcome.

b. Sonia showed RUIZ a commercial project
which she planned to take to Portugal and
asked him to read it because it was also of
interest to the Cuban mission in Spain.

¢, Sonia mentioned that the Plan of
Information wae still to be completed especially
in the priority categories of livestock and
econony.

a. They turned next to the topic of
the budget. Sonia said that the budget
for each mission had to be submitted before
the end of April {every year) and no additional
expenditures could be submitted for approval
during the cource of the year. Spain, Canada,
and France, however, would be treated individually.
Their special needs, such as acquisition of
were office space, raises in cost of living
allowances, etc., would be taken into comsiderstion
at any time.

5. During their various discussions RUIZ sired his
complaint about the ¥iea Department in Havana saying that
the department was practically worthless and that last year
76 cables regarding visas remained unanswered. Scnia
defended the Ministry saying taat it had a ict of work to
do, but RUIZ replied that they wanted to work only & kours
a day. They also discussed the scholarship situation. it
seems that during an interview between PRIETO (Probably
Jose PRIET GC Benitez, Director of Foreign Relations of
the DAP) and the Minister of Public Works, PRIETO was asked
to provide a list of scholership candidates to be considered
and he had none. fonia mentioned that in Belgium they aiso
lost four scholarships because of this sane reason.

6. According to QUTIMID Sonia GOMEZ Aragon is
married to one Miguel (LNU) and hes a daughter nased Iliaua.
Sonia's mother is still living although appeared to be very
411 at the time Sonia left for her trip to Madrid because
Sonia cabled at least twice to Havane inquiring about the
statue of her mother’s heeith. (TYLOTE reported that Sonia's
ome phone number in Havans is 7-4263.} Perhaps Headquarters
ean determine the full name of her husband by checking the
reverse telephone listings. Sonia is attractive, intelligent,
Sertious-minded and reserved. The last time she visited Spain
she stayed with Yers 5 ORODOWS KI and was on the same
type of mission as the present one ~ to discuss the Madrid
Bubassy's work plan. She also visited the Barcelonz Consulate
and the Cuban Subessy in Lisbon.
