SUBJECT: Bahamas/United States Black Power Ties

1 The monthly renort on e@ Bahamas for October 1968
contains several references

to ties between Black Power groups in the Bahamas and the
United States, which are provided, in full, below. A summary
of the report, omitting portions concerning the United States
or United States citizens, is being disseminated (see attached
report}. :

2. The items of possible interest, omitted from the
dissemination, are noted below:

v A, On 29 October 1968 Dr, Alfred D. King,
brother of the late Dr. Martin Luther King,
delivered a highly inflammatory address of a
racialist character at a public meeting in Nassau.
He severely attacked disparities in the Bahamas
between white and colored members of the popula-
tion. The disparities were highly exaggerated by
Ring who said that, while there was political
freedom in the Bahamas, black Bahamians did: not
have economic freedom,

B. Et is apparent that King came to the

. Bahamas op the invitation of Dudley Williams,
President of the Bahamas Engineering Fuel and

. Allied Workers Union, and Reverend R.E. Cooper,
a Baptist Minister. As'King's visit was his first
and was for so short a time, it is evident that

he spoke from a prepared brief, Another visiting

. Speaker, Erskine Hepburn, a Bahamian-born U.S.
naturalized citizen, President of Branch No. 589
of the AFL/CIO in Jacksonville, Florida, delivered
an address on similar lines as did Williams.

Both indicated that King might be invited to return
to the Bahamas. :

c. The pression gained is that Williams is
identifying the leaders of the Bahamas Federation
of Trade Unions with the Government and is endeav~
oring to extend the struggle within the union :
movement into the political field. To do this he

is prepared to exploit militant racialism for
political ends with possible further activities
by Dr. King and this could produce security
problems,
