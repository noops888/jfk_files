THE 201 SYSTEM aN

Rescission: Annex B of pal 27 October 1966
- RD

1, INTRODUCTI NO

ai

The 901 system pro\ia) Wy NY — a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations aN etorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are, normally subjects of extensive reporting and
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201- system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, ie., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying fi a for reporting’on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the offjefal aACANY ing the 201 opening form (Form

891) and all biographig seponting oy on said reese the individual, i.e, per-
sonal history, current Reais Drospeetay| <O

c. The Master 20; Rea age au generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produl ster 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent informatiSh-which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-

A201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (sce
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
ata later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the

security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.
