THE 201 SYSTEM

of specific in-

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file confaiming the 201 opening form (Form

831) and all biographic reponting on and refere

o the individual, i.e., per-

sonal history, current Satas, and prospects

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Index Search Request, is printed

as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-

erence consolidated.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned

when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see

paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added

at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201

personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the

security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members

of that service.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

OI code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915

and. 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

O1 code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA and those .

with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice
