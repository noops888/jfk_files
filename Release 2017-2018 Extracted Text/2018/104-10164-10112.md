insisted on numerous occasions. that he wild

be che next President of Meict, has been

chronically involved, directly or indirect-

GEN

ly, In rumored plots against President

Duvalier which have never materialized.

In May 1963 Charles is reported co have

passed word to US officials chrough an

American Journalist that he was in a

position so head = provisional govern-

ment after President Duvaller had been

removed from power. In subsequent years, particularly in 1966.

and 1967, Charles approached US officials both in New York

and Port-au-Prince with the apparent intention of enlating

US support for a group of conspirators he clalmed to lend

which was determined to topple Duvaller from power. None

of these plots materialized, however, and chere was never

my evidence to suggest that any serfous plans had been made.

In January 1969 Charles had a lengthy conversation with

an officlal of che US Embassy In which the former candidl.

discussed his grievances against Duvaller and the plot he

claimed to be instigating to overchrow Duvaller and replace

Aim as President of Haltl.

Chacles stated that che group

supporting his efforts consisted primarily of soldiera, a

few miliciamen, some professional men, priesta, studente,

and assorted other well-placed Individuals.

He claimed

Chat representatives of these groups had already agreed on

the essencial elements of a consticution which would 1n-

elude a bicameral legislatura and an operative political

party «cruceure.

The reporting official cautioned, how

to be aware of che identitics of these. men. Furthermore,

according to an official of the US Embassy, at one tim:

It appeared that Charles had origluated che idea of the

junta, hoping co utilize it evencually to launch his own

• candidacy

for

the Presidency, Subsequently, however,

Charles changed his statements about being

"che next

President" to being "a future President," and he seemed

to be placing some distance between himself and the pro

posed junta.

During Charles' forementioned conversation wich an

Embassy official In January 1969, he revealed other facets

of his personality as well as his penchant for plotting.

He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost

messianic terms. He said that he had invested

$2 million

In Halti and had done more. for the development of the

country than any othor indigonous Haitian.

He claimed,

for example, that the workers in the Artibonice were.

passionate admirers of his because his tannery In Port

Sondé (now closed) provided needed Jobs. He also claimed

the special allegiance of the chauffeur guides, the only

cruly organized workers in the country,

because when he

directed the compulsory Government Motor Vehicle Insurance

program, legitimate chauffeur claims were paid.:: He i

plled that such claims were no longer honored.

Discussing the internal probleme of his country,

Charles stressed the need for

lumediate stepe to prevent

• the total destruction of dalti's land and resources, to

control the spraling population growth, and to rejuvenate

the country's secondary cities.

To achieve chese goala

before current trenda become Irreversible, Charles belleves

chat it Is essential to pursue relations wich the United

States that would be conducive to massive asiatance: and

Investment,

In thia respect he inadate

that Duvaller,

damage by his rofunal, to recognise che cole the United

# 3 DEC 1963

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

Lo I recently spent approximately three days in Haiti (9-12 Dec 68) and

while there had extended vialta with Clemard Joseph Charles, President,

Banque Commerciale d'alti,

and aldo owner of a siaal plantation and u11l.

Present during my visits with Charlea was bis personnl assistant and con-

fidant, Ludovich Celestines.

Charles, & devout Catholic, personally told

ne that he intended to attempt to overthrow Duvaller.' He bas made spec1a10

plans for this overthrow In late February or early March 1969.

He claims

that he definitely has the Army and the Catholic Church with hin, and

that the overtbrow will

be without bloodshed.

I had. not intended to contaot other officiale or individuals in Halti.

3"' Hosever, on the last day of my stay I ma invited to viale vith clovis

N. Desinor, formerly Haiti's representative to the UN and currently Dr.

Duvaller 5 Minister of Finance. He 1a said to be the lo. 2 man in Haiti -

next to duvalier.

Present at the meeting with Desinor was his assistant,

Di. Herve Boyer and reportedly the No. 3 man.

§* In a period just prior to June 1967 Duvalier was convinced by Desinor and

Boyer that Charles was, or at least had been, plotting Duvaliers' over-

throw.

Together with & large group Charles was imprisoned In Port-au-Fringe

from June 1907 to June 1968. .

6. Just prior to the arrest of Charles, Max Rowe's wife, Raymonde, took

US$200, 000 out of the bank and hid 1t near Cap Haltien In the north and

advised Charles' wife of the location. ' In addition, Max Rovelalma

w1ll be able to get private finanoial assiutance from the US.

According

to Charles, US financial organizations have almost completely stopped

MEMORANDUM FOR TIE RECORD

this

morning about the letter mailed

and Brun had assured him that Felder said to mail letters

to him through Foreign Service mail channels.. Brun is in

contact with

Felder during his visits to Haiti and this

system was laid on between them during one of his triga.

Brun also said that he was a little upset about

the problems which had arisen in sending his letter. Brun

said that he had received a letter

from Felder

(mailed in

New York City) saying that he had never received the letter

from Brun.

Brun was concerned that the letter may have

fallen into the wrong hands in Haiti.

Musulin sald that

much

disturbed about this matter and that any further involve

la chère Sophie,

Cette lettr est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 m

beaules et du d juin en cours.

SI tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis non départ d'falti le 7 mal dernier,

elost que premièrement, je me proposais de retoumer voir Clénard le senaine

Le vojage a dû etre différé lorsque l'al su que Clémard avalt, à

nouveau, été srrêté le 1l mat.

J'ai mène eu & faire un câble à un ant pour

Jul annoscer mon arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en Informer.

Dueltrement, l'arrestation de Clémari ainal que les nouvelles der derniers

Avênements en Halti on eu des effets négatifs sur les néguciations en cours

que j'aval entamées pour Clémard et qui semblaient vouloir aboutir.

Je n'al

• pas besoin de te dire combien j'en al été bouleversé. Alors que nos enis

d'jel et nol pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous estimons conne un frère,

ma nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous

moun remettona a peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre

dévouement pour acmand.

1 salt, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne

saurions jamals marchander notre concours à un and pour qui nous avons a plus

grande affection et pour qui noua sonmes prêts à consentir tous les sacritices

personnnis que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que

11, en dehore c'Halti, je n'arrive a'le tirer de l'impasze dans laquelle 11 se

trouve, je doute fort, sane fauase modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre julese

possibilités respectives.

Depuie non retour d'faits je me suis mis en action à cette fin et ai personelle

ment vu plusteurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésite à

consacrer une grando partie un leur tenpe précieux à la concrétisation des plans

que j'a en à envisage? avec clémard en vue de la tirer d'embarras le plus

rapidement possible.

Nes espoirs de réusaite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis contactés se sont

heurtés aux effets négatifs Inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arres

tation de Clémerd que des derniers événements survenus en Halti depuis le

20 mal écoulé.

Je t'envole, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces

grands anis, Mr. Howard Durris de Washington, D.C. Je te demande de garder

cette lettre strictement confidenticlle car je n'aurais pas ainé que le nom

de ltr. Burris soit mentionné A quiconque en Haltl.. S1 cela arrivait, nous.

pourrions perdre un très bon ami.

Pour ton Information, Je te dirai que Mr. Burris est un colonel retraité du

Corps de Génie de l'arnée américaine, ant personnel et conseiller du Président

Johnson et extrêmement influent & Washingtor tant dans le monde politique que

financier.

J'al eu & faire deux voyages à Washington entre le 8 et 11 mal ou

cours desquels lu1 et mol erisagions jes moyens d'aider Ciénard selon le "modua"

envisagé.

La copie de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te coniirmer ce qui

précède.

J'al aussi vu personnellement et lui al causé maintes fois au téléphone,

Joseph Dryer, qui devait se rendre en Haiti le 24 mai pour te vois mais qui a

il renvoyer son voyage après les nouvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion.

Je lul al encore causé récemment au téléphone et 11 a eu à me faire part des

résultats negatifs de ses errorts, t

toujours en fonction des mêmes circonstances.

Le lettres adressées aux autres anie de l'étranger, dont Dabinovick, par example,

mont restées jusqu'ici sans réponses. Je vais une nouvelle fois écrire longue

ment & Dabinovick pour luf tranamettre ta dernière communication avec l'espoir

-d'evoir un mot encourageant de lud.

Coume tu

dole le comprendre, ma chère Sophie, nos efforts, malgré toute notre

bonne volonté, re sauraient, se concrétiser à brève échéance, cor les valeurs en

question qu'1l noua faut trouver ne sont pas insignifiantes. Je te signaleral en

passant un point qui e été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir.

que mêne si nos amin seraient en mesure d'avancer à Clémard les valeurs nécesnaires,

1le ont des doutes serioux non pas sur le sineórité de Clémara à faire face aux

obligatione qui devront être contractées, male à la possibilité matérielle de r

patrier, en dollars américains, les valeurs avançées.

J'al personnellement assiste

& des contacts avec des banquiern d'ici qui affirment qu'avant longtempe, Haltd

n'aura presque plus de devisos dollars pour solder ses camptes à l'étranger, Autant

d'obstacles que je suis malheureusoment obligé de te signaler pour que tu saches

D. quos t'en tente.

Ceci dit, malgré tous ces obatacles qui senbleraient Insurmuntables, je n'al

pag totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvolr t'alder à sortir Chlmard, saln et

aut, de la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, Je le anis. L'essentiel

est que le Chef lul même soit perruadé oe l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons l

satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon Imputables & Citard

mais plutôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.

Je prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finiase par réaliaer que clémard, en

bon patriote haitien, a eu fol en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, comme

plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son Intelligence pro

ductive.

Je me proposais d'ferire 'personnellement à Son Excellence le Prénident & Vie

d'Haiti, pour implorer sa clémence et un générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher.

Je me sule alors demandé si c'était la un geste sage qui pourralt avois la vertu

de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'al préférer m'abstenir.

Four revenir maintenant aux rossibilltés de feallser au moins partiellement, la

valeur exigée, je dols te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une

procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratlfier tout ce que

nous pourrions entreprendre a cette fin.

séparément, par cette même vole, je te comminiqueral toutes les formalités A

actions are not to be desired, not only because they are cosily to the

American taxpayers, but because they inevitably provole strong Anti-

American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did noching to heip

bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice and

decisions against the will of the people. It the U.S. Is to vair for the

DAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality or chaos, we are straid.

that connunist Influence and even control of the situstion by forces

based Is Cuba and other countries, will nase it much sore difficult to

cope with within the context of our national security. It 1a, therefore,

imperative, in our opinion, that the U.S, take some steps towards working

with local politicians to take the initiative of a coup which, when per

formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,

Mianncially and otherwise, to secure an orderly succession of the present

regime. As far as, lia1t1 1s concerned, I feed that I luve thi most adequate

solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever she security of

this nation or any nation is concerned, there 18 no time for wait ani-see

many tines. His-answers on such occasions lave, nost of the ilne, satisfy

were to behave in a different nanncs.. What would his death serve if he

had teken a position of ror-compronise! He feuls that in order to be

DUVALIER HIMSELF WAS IN THE

FOREFRONT OF THOSE CONSPIRACIES AND KNOWS FROM

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THE MOTIVATION OF THE PLOTTERS.

WHEN HE GETS RID OF MILITARY MEN OR CIVILIANS FROM

TINE TO TIME EVEN THOUGH THEY HELPED HIM GAIN POWER,

IT IS BECAUSE AS CHIEF OF STATE. HE IS FULLY AWARE OF.

THE REALITIES OF HAITIAN POLITICS. CLEMARD JOSEPH

CHARLES, WHO GAINED MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS UNDER MAGLOIRE,

WAS AMONG THOSE WHO FINANCED DUVALIER'S CAMPAIGN.

IT IS ONLY LOGICAL THAT DUVALIER WOULD RESENT THAT

FACT. FURTHERMORE, SINCE CHARLES IS ACTUALLY A

CANDIDATE FOR-THE PRESIDENCY AND MANEUVERING

AGAINST DUVALIER; DUVALIER WILL DISCOVER SOME "EVIDENCE"

LINKING CHARLES WITH THE NINETEEN EXECUTED OFFICERS.

ARRANGED THIS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES. HE NEEDED TO HAVE

GREW ANOTHER REASON WHY DUVALIER IS ANGRY AT CHARLES.

WHEN THE NON-FISCAL ACCOUNTS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANK RAN

CHARLES USED THESE BONDS IN HIS FINANCIAL MANIPULATIONS

: AND THEY FELL INTO THE HANDS OF FOREIGN SPECULATORS WHO

The following le ny humble appraisal of the politirel situation

now provallIng in Haltl.

As 1 ropeatedly stard. to enyors who may have asted he, ry noti-

vations are purely patriotic wille I en also noved by s sincese desire

tó see initi amorse as a dinerable independent ration friendly to the

United States.

Ameruin citizen, I have made several trirs to Haiti and have ruintained.

My latcet visit to Haiti took place on June 5th of this year and I

stayoi tro days In Port-au-Prince, Although the purpose of my trips

were mostly buniness I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian

political situation with politicians,

as well as with average Haltian

eitizens concerned with the situation.

ly personal conclusions are as

follows:

The fact le that the Duvallor regine 16, at present, in a state os :

Interial polltient contusion in which so one direcaly or Indircetiy.con

the question everybody 10 trying to sind the answas to. Neverthelose,

Duvaller rounded up the alledged associntes of Colonel Doninique and,

after a nock cous. martial secusing and convincing IS young arny officers

of treason they were 'all killed by a firing squad on sure 8, 1967 at

Fort Dinanche on the outskirts of Port angrince, Duraller himself was

allitio mcn

and civilians were also executed or sinilar charges, without

fanfare. It is alsn the general concensus of opinion that the "purce"

vill continue at a rate that no one can yet deterine.

i jo one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings

between two croups within the. President's family and close asociates.

One 18 headed by Colonel Da-inique and his wife Marle-Denise Duvalier,

and another is led by irs. Yvon St. Victor, the President's private se

erctary and confidante. The names of the President's wife, Simone, his

son Jean-Claude and his younger daighter Sinone, are being mentioned as

being part of the first grup. In the second group, Mrs. 'St. Victor's

brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Nr. lue-Abert

roucard, who 1s also married to one of the Presicent's daughter, 18 among

other names such as Henri Siclalt, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert

In. Pierre, etc. mentioned to be siding with drs. St. letor. So far, the

President has shown signs that he favers the latter group. The ramifica-

•tions of both grosps extend to people who were considered the most fanatic

supporters of Duvalier hinself. The fact is that none of the remaining

so-called strong men of Luvalier in the milltil, the fonton Macoutes. or

the Army know for sure how the president feels towarde them and are very

men concerned about their own future and aurvival... In other vords..

contusion and insecurity are wide spread amonget buvalser's followers.

larg believe that in spite of the actual confusion and cense of Insecurity

provalling in governnent circles; there 18 no real organized opposition

in such against Duvalier at this moment, except for what I will point out

later in this paper.

iw-i,

well succeed to turn the country into a now communiat satcllite and work

out some agreements with communist countrles. Here again, se should not

fall to mention the new exchange of diplomatie representations between

Halth and some comminiat countrics.. The most Blenliicant one 1a the now

Duvaller 18 closely working with.

Taking everything Into consideration:

!. The non existence of ary organized opposition In Halts;

2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust anongst the exiled

political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action from

outalde Haiti;

3. The fear of local pollticians that, it outside forces were to come

In, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they

mhould resiat such intervention and do whatever la necessary to prevent

#. The fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated

" The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.3. 1e not working

It vould be childish, however, to formulate an optaton only on the,

basts of the mentioned facts, althouch on the surface, they appear

logieal enough to confim these conclusions.

I az convenced in my own mind, that then some politicians close to

Duvalier will feel that their lives are. In real danger, some of then

Will successfully attempt to eliuinate him even though thay mey not be,

therselves, in a position to control the chaotle situation that will ne

cessarily follow. This 18 where the real danger 18. If any such uri

planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find 1tself

with a real "not potato", reguiring such drastic action sintlar to those

takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominicon Rerublic. Such

actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the

American taxpayers, but because they Inevitably provoke strong anti-

American feelings bused on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help

bring about the collapse, but le merely there to Impose Ite choice and

decisions against the w111 of the people. If the U.S, is to wait for the

OAS to decide

on joint action in the eventuallty of chaos, we are afraid

that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces

based in Cuba and other countries, will make 1t much more difficult to

cope with within the contest of our national security. It 10, therefore,

Imperative, in our opinion; that the U.S. take some steps towarde working

vith local politicians to take ine Initiative of a coup which, when per.

formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,

financialy and otherwise; to sucure an orderly succession of the present

ragine. As far as Halti 18 concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate

aclution for the proporad action. I fool that whenever the recurity os

anda nation or any nation 1e concerned, there 10 no time for wait and sed

coneiderations: In the case of Halts, in particulor, where the political

mcene 1e really deprived of Individuals of strong convictions; one vay or

the other, we feed that the U.8, should not have any problem in findina

nomeone that they can build poistically and work with in a aincere and

doyl effort to help that small nation solve some of 140 perennial probient.

myself; sometimes, felt that he went too far. I have alco told him so,

wore to behave in a different mannes. What would his death serve 1f he

had taken a position of nor compromise? He feels that in order to be.

able to control the altuation and outlive Duvaller, 1t was better to be

"In" than "out"' or to put it another way to be alive than dead... I can

"ay that on several occasions, was 1t not for Mi. Charles! Influence on

Duvalder, this latter would have done nore har to the poor pelple of

Haiti, in general, than he has done so fer.

I have always maintained A dielogue with Mr. Charles and passed on to

his as meh as posaible the judgements of Haitians and others with whom

he had no direct contact. I must say that I have alwaye find hin f

coptive to their opiniona.

Everiince I have know Mr. Charles, he has alvays told me of his

ambitione and determination to be a Breat lastian. He asked no to never

let him down and to stay with him to hoip him carry out his dream. Though

•I5 has 800t me sno of my friends, I have extended to him everything that

I could poseibly offer to help him roach his 8oa1s.

Unlike the majority of lisition politiolane, My. Charles has an 11-

mumontable faith In the suture of hlu country. He feele that 14 Halt,

under Divator, has conelderably recrauned in evory way, the time War 60n0

the U.S.. 18 I statod before, vr. Charles feeld that without United

States backing, no government con possibly exiat in Halti except undor

the very some conditione of Duvalier's Government, There would be no

season to precipitate a change 11 laiti vere to ramain under a tyranical

dictatorahip like Duvaller's...

What Mr. Charlos 1a asking as a prereguisite of any setion to be

sponsorod or initiated by him 1s the assurance from a person of established

authorsty In the U.S. Govemment that the United States will support. the

provisional government that vill necessarily have to assure pover after

Duvadier.

The dispositions taken by Me. Charles are that e military coup by a

Junta will take over and stay in power until free eloctions are held. the

nonbers of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles,

wno has their commitments to that enfoct. Mr. charles bosdove that 11

8r0e elections are hoid he should not have any great difficulty in selling

Mo plane and programa to the people and tinerofore be elmeted the next

president. of Hasta. In my opinion, Mr. Charles 1e nos aiking too much.

Should the United States consent to his request in the form mentioned

above, I feel that the Haitian altuation, long a sore note in the U.s.

hemiopherse relationa, sould be changed without risk far all partien

concerned:

Why should the United States gamble on any other calculated risis,

vn190 I feel, 1t can wrap up the situation safoly in accord with Mr.Charien

Piano! The military junta proposed by Me. Charles will be made up by higi

Ms, Charles feels that althouch it will probably be impossibie to prem

vent acts of reprisals during the first T2 hours of the misdiary take.

over, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

Ma. Charles, in my opinion, is one of the few indivituals around whom

a reconciliation of all the social divisions and subdiviaiona of the

Haitian fanily can be achievedo. I will mention some of the baste reasons

behind this opinion:

1. He 1s of modest rural extraction, therefore is what 1a called in

Hasts a "son of the lasses";

2. He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the

Hastian people vho, at this point, considor: the 11cht-akin laltian as

& threat for the retum of the domination of the mulatto minority:

3. He 1a deprived of the prejudice of color, therefore the mulatto

minority will find in him a' certain feeling of socurity and can be ai

mged that 1t will not be persecuted solely on the basio of the color. os

their skins;

= = 4o He la wealthy, therefore eredited for not ambitioning power for

mere personal gaina;

3. He is known to be a hard, Intelligent industriellet and admini

Brator capable of promoting and encouraging the establishment of now..

buodnons and Industries in Hast;

6. He has shown respect for certain moral values suen as the undeniable

right of the individual to live without fear within the franevork of the

laws of the land;

B. Being a businessnan in his own sicht, the business community with

which he has dealt through the canber of Connerce and his bank will

alvays have a dialogue with him and therefors will find him receptive

to their succestions and erdeavours;

9. Having dealt with elements of the actual regime who huve his

confidence, he will. be able to coatrol then in a way which will avoid

unnecessary hardahips should soneone cise - a complete stranger to them

be In a position of Covernment leaderahip;

20. He is known to be strongly anticountst and to American, there

fore opening the door to close cooperation with the United States, under

the doctrine of the Alliance for Progress, to promote better understanding

and opportunities for the Haltian people with the help of the United

States;

11. He will welcome the retur of ald Haltian exiles to take their

place new within the Haition community and to work with him to the task

of making the country a safer and better pace to live;

22. He does not contemplate any reprisals or even sanctions against

anybody for their past polltical affiliations, his efforte to be mainly

directed not to solve the errors of the just, but to providé a better

present and future for those who want to. Live in Haiti.

The tank; 11 and when he succeede to gain power, will not be an easy

one. I an sure, hovever, that ir: Charles Will be able to find the sip

port of enough honent and patriotle Hastiane to help him cary out his

dream of buriding up a better Halts.

Mr. Charles' past affiliation with the Duvalier regime should not,

therefore, be held against him. la a mattor of fact,. thia affillation may

sive rin the foreaigit that he should do his utmost not to repent the seno

In conclunion, I feel that the U,0, Goverment, through 148 qua11tzed

Agencies, should give No. Charless offer. so soppie the Duvalies regime, e11

BUT THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH WITHOUT FOREIGN HELP TO STAY IN

POWER.: HE WARNED THAT IF U.S. GOVERNMENT HELP IS NOT FORTHCOMING,

THE CASTROITE HAITIANS HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF SEIZING POWER.)

P. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF

CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES HAS BFEN DRAWN FROM INFORMATION FROM

VARIOUS RELIABLE SOURCES: SINCE ABOUT 1983, CHARLES HAS TRIED

TO GAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF AS THE SUCCESSOR:

TO PRESIDENT DUVALIER; HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN

OPPORTUNIST, SHREWD, CAPABLE, AND UNSCRUPULOUS, AND HAS DUVALIER'S

CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAS USED TO FURTHER HIS OWN EFFORTS AGAINST

DUVALIER. THE INFORMATION WHICH FOLLOWS

APPEARS TO BE NOTHING

MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CHARLES' ATTEMPTS TO PANIC THE U.B.

GOVERNMENT AND THEREBY GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. COVERNMENT

WHICH MAY CONSIOER CHARLES AS THE LESSER OF A NUMBER OF EVILS.:

HIS ALLEGED SUPPORTERS, LISTED BELOW, ARE BELIEVED TO BE

IXBIGXIFICANT AND HIS ALECED ARE SUPPORTERS ARE BUSPRCT.

CARLS' REFERENCE TO FIDEL CASTRO AND DOMINICAN PRESIDENT

JOAQUIN ANAGUER AB HIE COMPITITORS IN A, RACE TO OVERTHROW

DUVALIER IS CONSIDERED TO BE WITHOUT BASIS " A CALCULATION BY

CHARLES TO FORCE THE U.B, GOVERNMENT' & HAND IN HIS FAVOR.
