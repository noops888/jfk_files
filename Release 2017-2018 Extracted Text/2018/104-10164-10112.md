RAITT Clémard Joseph CHARLES eae i

President and General Manager : : '
of the Commercial Rank of Haiti

Clémard Joseph Charles, a man who has
insisted on numerous occasions.that he will
be the next President of Heiti, has been
chronically involved, directly or indirect-
ly, in rumored plots against President = *
-Duvalier which have never materialized.

In May 1963 Charles is reported to have
assed word to US officials through an
american journalist that he was in a
Position to head a provistonal g
ment after President Duvalier had been
removed from power. In subsequent years, particularly in 1966
and 1967, Charles approached US officials both in New York
and Port-au-Prince with the apparent intention of enlisting
US support for a group of conspirators he claimed to id.
which was determined to topple Duvalier from power. None —
of these plots materialized, however, and there was never
any evidence to suggest that any serious plans had been made,

to be aware of the identitiss of these men, Furthermore,
according to an official of the US Embassy, at one tine
it appeared that Charles had originated the idea of the
junta, hoping to utilize it eventually to launch his own
candidacy for the Presidency, Subsequently, however,
Charles changed his statements about being “the next
President" to being "a future President," and he seemed
to be placing soma distance between himself and the pro-
posed junta, ectetecraatic

During Charles' sforementioned conversation with an
Embassy official in January 1969, he revealed other facets
of his personality as well as his penchant for plotting.
He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost
messianic terms,’ He said that he had invested §2 million
in Hated and had donc more-for the development of the
country than any other indigenous Haitian, He claimed,
for example, that the workers in the Artibonicte were i:
passionate admirers of his because his tannery in Port
Sondé (now closed) provided needed jobs, He also claimed.
the special allegiance of the chauffeur guides, the only
truly organized workers in the-country, because when he
directed the compulsory Government Motor Vehicle Insurance
program,: legitimate chauffeur claims were paid,...We' ime

stressed the need for immediate steps to prevent:

before current trends become irreve!
that it is essential to pursue relations.with the United
States that would be conducive to massive assistance: and
investment. In this respect he insists that Duvalier”

H Banque Commerciale d'Haiti, and also owner of a sisal plantation and will.
| Present during ny visits with Charles vas his personal assistant and con-
fidant, Ladovien(Gelestines, Charles, a devout Catholic, personally told -
me that he intended to attempt to overthrow Duvalier.’.He has made specific
for this overthrow in late February or early March 1969. He claims
‘that he definitely has the Army and the Catholic Church with bim, and
that the overthrow will be without bloodshed. - :

2. ‘I had not intended to contact other officials or individuals in Haiti.
’ Hovever, on the last day.of my stay I was invited to visit with Clovis ri
M. Desinor, formerly Haiti's representative to the UN and currently Dr. ties
Duvalier's Minister of Finance. He is said to be the No. 2 man in Haiti -
ext to Bie paalier. Present at the meeting with Desinor was his assistant,
Dr. Herve Boyer and reportedly the No. 3 man.

Dear.Mr. Brun. | ¢ Sige:

I apologize for the delay in responding to your.
suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti.
, My activities here have been such that I have been
“ unable. unt tl the past day or so to give your pro-
posal adequate thought and consideration. :

‘4rst'I must admit that the recent abortive invasion
attempt caused cortain reflection and it. is this
kind of activity, successful or unsuccessful, that

ould cre c ser‘sus dislocations for those. established 2
an business, iswever I must assure you that this was ae
only a refleceion and the reason that I will be unable i
te accep: your offer is the extent and nature of ‘my
activities here in Washington, -T believe I. alluded
to some of thum during your visit. ‘The cecasions. when
I would find it possibl< to visit Port-au-Prince or to
deve’ any aieni#icant amount o? time ito the bank's
actiwiticn here would be rare indeed. ‘I shall. coniess
&o you that I declined a similar position on, a bank
board here in the states for the. same reason, :

. ' a
2 regret that this decision is necessary but I hope
that ir future relationships we may be able.to; do

thing useful and succossful in Haiti.

your courtesy in recommending mo the Albin Sowers

hopo I expressed that the assistanoo of tho U. Se

order that Haiti may be relieved from the tyranny
and misery in which has been inconsideratoly throm,
end have succeeded in securing the eympathy and sup

people are ready and eager to begin operations and

I would havo already given then
éxder to strike, through the Chief who ie the only
one in contact with me, were it not for my approhens=
don that the turmoil that will neceorarily follow. -
might serve Castro's plan to introduce communist ag-
dtatore in the country. I also have reuacn to wonder -

“S qbeut Balaguer’s pooition on account of his friendly :

feelings for Duvalier. Therefore, before going any i
further, I fool thet it would be wise for ma to have

Ghe fect is that the Duvalicr regime is, at preset, ina state on
internal political confusion in. which no one atrectly or indirectly con~
“nected with it cen predict the outecn, There in strong evidence showing.

that his son-in-law, Colonel Max Dominique, has.in fact tried to overthrow

Duvalier in order to personally asevne the direction of Haiti's political
affairs. How Duvalier becemo aware of Colonel Dominique's intentions is
"the qiestion everybody is trying tc find the anower to. Nevertheless,

Under those circunstances, Duvalier loosing his old grip on key

Haiti cnd some communist countries. The most si;

Zleans one is the new
eppointnent in Haiti of on Acbessador from Poland with whoa,I was gold, =’
Duvalier is closely worxing with.

Taking everything into consideration:

1. The non existence of any orgenized opposition: in Raisi;

2. The stace of non cohesiveness and distrust cnongst Cie exiled
political elenents abroad, therefore nullitying any positive action fron
outside Haiti;

3. The fear of local politicians that, if outside foreea were to cone,
in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therevore they, ,
should resist such intervention ond de whatever is pecensary to prevent we
it at all cost;

4, the fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated
upon mere suspicion, % or unjust dendheiations;

S$. Tre middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.S. is not vorking

even supporting the regime intentionally or unintentionally »y not en=
Gouraging or allowing the opposition to organize itself;

6. The interpretation of the above classes which are.at a loss tq under,
stand the silence of the U.S. press in general for not having raised the.
Weuel indignation about the recent mass killings, therefor making room

Duvelier with said press, particularly the New York Times, to refrain from |
‘ringing these facts to the attention of international publie opinion,‘

T. The strong belief th-t compromises have been worked out with President
Balaguer in the- Dominican Ewpublic to return to Haiti al opponents of -
Duvelier wao had fled there,

more.


It would be ehtldish, hovever, to formulate an opinion only ea the,
basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear’
logical exough te confirm these conclusions. : :

_ I en’ convenced in ry own mind, that when some politicians close to
Duvalier will feel that their lives are in real dances, soze of thes
will successfully attexpt to eliminate him even though they may not be,
thenselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that vill ne-
cessorily follow. -Tnhis-is where the real danger is. If any such un-
planned action was allowed to vake place, the U.S. will thea find itself
with a recl "hot potato”, requiring such drastic action similar to, those
takin in 1965 durfng the recent crisis in the Dominican Republic. Such
. eetions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the
dmerican taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong dnti-
feerican feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did novhing to help
bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice“and *
Gecisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is to wait for the
OAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality of chaos, we are ufraid
‘that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces
’ based in Cuba and other countries, will make it mich more difficult: to
\ @ope with within the context of cur national security. It.is, therefore,
“\ “$mperative, in our opinion, that the U.S. take some steps towards working
“with local politicians to take the initiative ofa coup Which, when per=
‘formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,
financially and otherwise, to sccure an orderly succession of the present
regime. As far eg Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have the most. adequate
solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the security of
this nation or any nation is concerned, thore is no time for wait-and-see
considerations, In the case.of Haiti, in particular, where cho political
-“geene ie really deprived of individuals of etrong convictions, one way or
“the other, we feal that the U.S. should not have any problan in finding
. SomsoRC that they can build‘ politically and work with in a. cincors and

° ‘Baita:, in general, than he has done so far,

in connection with the possibility oF finding a political Leader,
as indicated above, I rust say that J have been in contact with a man
whos, I feel, could very well.*! 1 the position. His naxe is Clérard

I have mown sir, Charles sincs 1951. We have been friends and = *
business associates eversince. To =e, Nx, Charles is a true ond sincere
patriot. OF course, today, o nusber of people question his patriotiss ©
on the besis of his close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have
nyself, sonetines, felt.that he went too far. I have also told him so,
many tines. His-answers on such occasions have, most of the iime, satisfy
my own judgenent. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvalier, ~
es he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if-he
were to behave in a different manner, What would his death serve if he
had teken a position of ron-conproniset He feels that ih order to be-
able to control the situaticn and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be
"gn" than “out" or to put it another way to be alive than dead. I can
say that on’ several occasions, was it not for Nr. Charles!.influence on
Duvalier, this latter would have done more harm to the poor pelple of

T have elvays maintained a diologue with Mr. Charles.and passed on to

Let hin-down and to stay with him to help him. carry out his dream. Though

Teould possibly offer to help him reach hie goals.
Unlike the majority of Maitian politicians, Mr. Charles haa aon un-

He sincerely believes in the spirit

the U.S. As I stated before, Mr. Cuarles feels that without United : |
$

States bscking, no coverazent can possibly exist in Haiti except under
‘the very’ caxe conditions of Duvalier's Government. There would be no
reason to precipitate a change. if Haiti were to renain under a Esrmioet
Gictatorship lixe Duvalier's.

“What Nr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite or any action to be a a
spunsored or initiated by him is the assurance fron a person of established
authority in the U.S. Governnent thet the United States will support the
provisional govern=zent thet will necessarily have to assure power after
Duvalier, 4

The dispositions taken by Mr. Charles are that a nilitary coup by @
Junta will take over and stay in power until free elections are ‘held. The

‘ penbers of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles,

\ who has their commituents to that effect. Kr. Charles believe that if.
free elections are hel he should not have any great difficulty in selling
his plans and progrens to the people and. therefore be elected the next

. “ president of Haiti. In ay opinion, Mr. Charles is not asking too much.

* Should the United States consent to his request in the form mentioned
,ebove, I feel that the Haitian situation, long a sore note in the U.S. ©
hemispheric relations, could be changed without risk for 22) parties
eoncerned.

While I feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Charles'

plona? The military junta proposed by Mr. Cnarles will be made up by. high

wanking officers of the Haitian army loyal to him, therefore on the side
of the U.S, With U.S, assistance - 4t is almost impossible othervise = the
teps proposed by Mr. Charles after the junta will take over areas follows:

‘2. Disazm- the Militia and the Tonton Macoutes immediately;

» Reorganize the Army and the Covernment services; ‘

3. Prevunt the interference of conmindet forces made of exiles Haitians

| based tn Cuba or seeuhare;



4S. Prevent the return to the Haitian political seene of such “rebble= —
rouscr” so-called leaders as Daniel Fignole ané Heari Vixanar;

. 5. Stary the cround wor for free ‘elections as soon as pousible.
re Charles feels that although it will probably te impossitie to pre=
vent ects G reprisals during the first 72 hours o7 the military take
over, ctronz efforts should be rade to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. :

Ne. Chorles, in my opinion, is one of the fev. individuals around whes
@ reconciliation of all the social divisions and subdivisions of the
Kaition fanily con be achieved. I will mention sone of the basic reasons
dehind this opinion:

- 2. He is of sodest rurcl extraction, therefore is what is called in
Haiti a "sen of o the nesses"; :
®, He is black, thereZore representing the vast majority of the
“Haitian pecple who, at this point, considers the light-skin Haittin as
@ threat for the return of the domination of the mulatto minority;

3. He is deprived of the prejudice of color, therefong the mlatto
minority will find in him a certain feeling of security and can be as~.
@ared that it will not be persecuted solely on the basis of the color of
their skins; c

&, He 4s wealthy, therefore credited for not a power for ~
| mere personal gains; : :

Plot of Clenard Charles to Overthrow Duvalier

At the suggestion of Mr. Bowdler, Howard Le Burris,
1725 K St., N.W., @ Washington bua: gman who served in
the past as an assistant military aide to the President,
telephoned this morning and asked me to meet Mr. Louis A.
Brun at Mr. Burris' office. This I did this afternoon.

Mr. Brun, & natioaslired American, owns and. operates
the B & B International Corporation, 1182 Broadway, New
York. A native-bora Haitian, he hes lived in the Etates 1
since 1957. He is a close friend and confidant of Clemard si
Joseph Charles, a Haitian banker who has been deeply involved
with the Duvalier government. Charles has fallen ia disfavor
with Duvalier and several of his goveroment concessions have
been cancelled. Charles is actively plotting the overthrow
of Duvalier and, according to Brun whc saw. Char z
Post au Prince -Juné. 5-7, has. 167-military-and.¢

who -are erently in diplomatic asylum,

In the past, Charles hes made efforts himself and
¢hrough Brun to gét the U.S. Government to coamit. itself in
* favor of the overthrow of Duvalier but until. récently: el),

of these approaches were rebuffed, U.5. officiels- having,

" etated U.S. policy was such that.no plot of this nature could
. be eupported. Brun showed me.a. letter he had: just received :
Seem Charkes written on June 23 stating in @ coumarcial Lengu-~
age eode which Brun end Charles use in their: kb berprarey

Ghat en American official last week had met with. Charles. in.
Port-au-Prince end thet Charles was most pleased with the:
westing. The implication was thet this ‘American" had
fadicated. to Charles that the U.f. Government favored the «
plotting. I flatly told Brun that the U.f. was not interested

in supporting plotting of this nature, that our policy had
not » and that he should know this categorically. Brun
smilingly accepted this statement, but obviously considered
the “approsch” in Port-au-Prince was more important than ay

exposition of U.S. policy,

Brun said he was in regular contact with Major Janes
Balog who, ihe described, as an intelligence officer from the
Pentagon. ie seid that he, Brun, had written a report on his
opinion re things Heitian and had given one copy to :
Major Balog and one to Mr.: Burris.” He: then handed me a copy
which is attached. This report is basically a plea for U.S.

overthrow of Duvelier, aes : :

| Te following 46 my hunble appraisal cf the peaitinel situation
Row prevatling in Heiti. . : oa
As 1 repeatedly stat:d to enyons who may have asked me, my moti- |
vations sre purely patriotic ‘wiile I eu also moved by a sinsexe desire
a tél bee tinttt oserge as a dvnocratie independent natica friendly to the ”
| United States. :
| Since I left Haiti with my fanily ten years ago to later canner
Aweriwnn citizen, T have made several trips to Haiti and have maintained |
close contacts with people in all walks of life both in Haiti and with
| those who were forced out of the country for political reasons or other-
j wise. aH :
--. My Lstest visit to Haiti took place’on June 5th of this year and I
etayed tvo-days in Port-au-Prince. Althcugh tle purpose of my trips
, ." . *. were mostly business I also had thy opportunity to discuss the Haitian
ie political situation with politicians, as well as with average Haitien
ssescisiot, _ ,Sitizens concerned with the situation: My personal conclusions are os

follows: Ch
‘The fact te that the Duvelicr regis is, at t pcoent! in a state of a
* &nternal politienl confusion in which no one, directly or indfrectly .con=
nected with it con predict the outcaas. There is strong evidence showing
“that his sonein-lav, Colonel Max Dosinique, has in fact tried to overthrev
Duyslier in order to personally assume the direction of Haiti's political
effeira, How Davalier became eware of Colonel Deminique's intentions is XN
" tha-sjuastion everybody 40 trying to find the ensver to, Nevertheless,
Duvalier roundod up the alledged associetes of Colanel Dominique and,
“after @ uock court martial eccusing and convincing 19 young amy officers
‘Of treason they vore ‘all killed ty a firing squad on cune 8, 1967 at
Fort Dimanche on the outekirts of PorteauPrince, Duvelier himself vas -
) present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique to-be.a menber of
the firing squad; -Non-confirmed information from usually reliable sources



indicates that several other persons, low rani ing military personnel,
militia men and civilians were also executed oF similar charges, without
fenfare. It is also the general concensus of op:nien that the "purge"
vill continue at a rate that.no one can yet determine, : :
!,4Ne one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings |
detween tuo groups within the. President's family and clos: associates.
One is headed ty Colonel Doxinique and his wife Marie-Denise Duvalier,
and another is led by Hrs. Yvon St.Victor, the President's private se~
erctary and confidante. The names of the President's wife, Simone, hi:
eon Jean-Claude and his younger daighter Simone, are being mentioned as -\ e
being part of the first grup. In the second group, Mrs, St.Victor's oe
brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Xr. Luc-Albert
Foucard, who is also married to one of the Presicent's daughter, is smc
éther nenes cuch as Henri Siclait, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert . i
Jn.Plerre, ets. mentioned to be siding with urs. St. victor, So far, the ©
President has shoun signs that he favers the latter group. The ramifica-
-tions of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fenatic
®upporters of Duvalier himself. The fact is that none of the remaining
®o-ealled strong men of Duvalier in the militin, the Tonton Macoutes or
the Army know for sure how the president feels towards them and are very:
siuch concerried about their om future and survival... In other words
onfusion and insecurity are wide spread emongst Duvalier's followers. it
TAKE believe that in spite of the actual confusion and sense of insecurity,
pfevetling in government circles, there is no real organized opposition ~
Be such against Duvalier at this moment, miss for vhat I will point an!
Later in this paper.

: eee



Cae Z : : : =$-

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the
basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear
logical enough to confirm these conclusions.

I ax convenced in my own mind, ‘that when some politicians close to
Duvalier will feel that their lives are. in real danger, sone of then
will successfully attempt to eliminate him even though thoy me; not be,
thexselves, in @ position to control the chaotic situation that will ne-
cessarily follow. This is where the real danger is. If any such un-
planried action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself
with a real "hot potato", requiring cuch drastic action similar to those
takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominicen Republic. Such \
actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the
American taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong anti~
american feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help
bring about the collapse, but i6 merely there to impose its choice and

- @ecisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is co wait for the |
OAS to decide on Joint action in the eventuality of chaos, ve are afraid
that communist influence and-even control of the dituation by forces
‘based in Cuba and other countries, will make.it mich more difficult to
eope with within the context of our national security. It is, therefore,
imperative, in our opinion,..that the U.S, take some steps towards working
with local politicians to take she initiative of a coup which, when per=
formed, would receive the. strong backing of this country, militarily,

‘ ftnancially and otherwise, to secure an orderly succession of the present
“wegime. As far as Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate
selution for the Proposed action, I feel that whenever the security of
‘this nation or any nation is concerned, there is no time for wait-and-seq
@ensideretions, In the case of Haiti, in particular, where the political.
goene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictions, one way or.
‘the other, ve feel.that the U.S. should not have any problem in finding
jmeone that they-can build politically and vork with in @ sincere and -
deyal effort to help that small nation solve some of ite perennial problezs. 4



‘ “~

i In connection with tho possibility of finding a political leader,
hp @s indicated above, I must say that I have been in contact with a man
a whom, I fcel, could very woll x: 1 the position, -His name is Clémerd

Bversince I have known Mr. Charles, he has alvays told ne of his
mbitions and determination to-be a great Haitian, He asked me to never
“Ret him down ‘and to stay vith nim to help him carry.out hia dream, Though
4G has cost me cone of my friends, I have extended to him everything that
oo B goula, poseibly offer to help him roach his goals.
(2? unltke the. majority of Mattian politicians, Mr. Chailes has an-un-
gumontable faith in the future of his cositry. He feels that if Kaiti, |
under Divalier, has considerably regressed in evory way, the time will cone:



to Join the other progressive nationo of this heniephore. Unlike those
politicians who have scen their prominent positions as a temporaty state
of effaire with absolutely no future beyond Duvalier, Mr; Charles has i
Practically invested in Haiti almost ell the wealth that he has -sacuaulam * yt
ted before and during Duvalier's reign throuch genuine efforts anf self= ~- 7 |
GQiecipline. Of course, I will admit.that his wealth would not have . .
inereased in its prasent proportion if it wes not for Duvalier's favors |
to him, Dut who clse under the previous regimes who were in-the same ae : |
position have gentinely directed their efforts in using their caine for, 7
the betterment of the people? I have alvays find that Mr. Charles took
very much eatiefaction in giving employment and assistace to as many
people as he possibly could. As a matter of fact this is one of his
. ‘baggest assets in his present struggle.
Mr, Charles is not a demagogue. Ile believes in the realities of the
modern world. He realizes that without the assistance of the U.S.,
progress ic impossible for Haiti. He sincerely believes in the spirit
* ef the Alliance for Progress, Having traveled extensively, he 46 fully
"Giware of the tragic state of stagnation in. which his.country is in, He
"" Geeply wishes to see Haiti make some progress in the fields of human
dignity, education, technology and above all, Freedom.-
CE cs AML Chat 2 have said so ‘far are ay om personal opinion. and also the
opinion of @ large number of people in and out of Haiti. If some defer
. in their avaluction of Mr, Charles, it 1s their privilege and undeniable
vighte, : :
Now, if we are to take for granted my opinions, what does Mr. Charles ..
pave to offer to the-U.S, to prevent the chaos that will necessarily
follow Duvalicr's dowfell?. First of all,.br. Charles is ot present
“ weady and willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's regime,
his, he ascursd me, he can do without any. cuteide acsistencs. 2 as
personally aware of certain: confidential dispositions taken by him to
assure the success. of a aoup.if and. when he decides to make it. Way dees

where, like a miracle, the country wilt acain take its course forward i
\

{



Rot he go ahead and-nake it, you Ray ask? His reply ie that should ' : ’
he make it, what abeurances docs he havo that ‘hie action will satiufy ae '
the U.S,. As I stated before, Xr, Charles feels that without United —
States backing, no government can possibly exist in Haiti except. undor
the vory same conditions of Duvalier's Government. There vould de no
Feason to precipitate a change if Haiti were to romain under a tyranical
Aletatorship like Duvalier's... an

Whet Nr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite of any action to be — . {
sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance from a person of established
authority in the U.S. Government that the United States will eupport. the
Provisional government that will necessarily have a assure power after |
Duvalier,

The dispositions taken by Mr. Charles are that @ military coup by a
dunta will take over and stay in power until free eloctions are held. ‘che
ae \ monbers of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charl

* Who has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles beliave that if
: * free elections are hcid he should not have any great difficulty in selling:
“. Ais plans and programs to the people and therefore ba ‘elacted the next.
- president. of Haiti, i my opinion, Mr. Charles is now. aking too much.
Ls \fhewld the United States consent to his request in'the form mentioned
‘roa. @beve, I feel that the Haitian situation, long @ sore rote in the U.S.
‘fi. Nantepherte relations, could be changed without risk for ell parties
CAD “qeneemeds
x Way ehould the United States gamble on any other calculated rik
vhile f feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Char!,
plana? The military junta proposed by Mr. Charles willbe made up by high
vanking officers of the Haitian army loyal to him, therefore on the side
. OF the U.S. With U.S, assistance = tt is almost impossible. otherwise = the! §
Gteps proposed by Mr. Charles after the junta will take over are. y follower:
2. Disarm the Militia and the Tonton Maccutes immediately)
&. Reorganise the. Arny and the Governucnt survices;
3. Prevent the interference of conmuniet forces made.of exil1s Haitians
‘pased in Cubs or eleewhore) ted ot

4, Provent the return to the Haitian political scone of ouch "rabblee.
rousor" so-called leaders as Daniel Fignole and Honri Vixamar;

5. Star. the ground work for free elections as soon as possible.
Mr, Charles feels that although it will probably be impossibie to pre=
vent acts of reprisals during the first 72 hours of the milivary take,
aver, atrong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary bloodshed,
* Me, Charles, in my opinion, is. one of the few individuals around whom
@ reconciliation of all the social’ divisions ond subdivisions of the
Haitian family can-be achieved. I will mentions sone of the baste reasons
dehind this opinion: z

1. He is of modest rural extraction, therefore is What is called in
Maiti a “son of the masses";

2. He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the

‘Haitian people who, at this point, considers the light=skin Haitian as

@ threat for the return of the domination of the milatto minority;

3. He 4 deprived of the prejudice of color, therbfore tha milatto
Btnority will find in him a certain feeling of sccurity and can be as=
gured that it will not be persecuted solely on the basis of the color. of ”
their skins;

- by He ts wealthy, therefore oredtted for not eibitioning power for
: Mere personal gains; 7

~ $e He is known to be a hard, intelligent industriclist and eAniniss
"erator capable of promoting and encouraging the establishment of nev,
“~usiness and industries in Ha2td;

6. He has chown respect for certain moral values. such os the undeniable
right of the individuel to live without fear within the framevork of the
“favs of the land; i Baie

<1 Te He 46 9 Roman Catholic. vhe professes to have nothing to do with

which he has dealt through the Chamber of Commerce and his bank will :

‘The task, 4f and vhen he "succeeds to gain power, will not be an easy

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT Clemerd Joseph CHARLES (201-357029)

Le Peghergund: Clemard Josaph CHARLES, born Gonaives, Haiti,

21 April Negro of peasant origin. CHARLES ts a shrewd,
opportunistic, ‘ily dishonest individual whose natural talents
have been channelled to President DUVALIER's advantage over a period
of ten years. liavino made considerable money in the banana busin
CHARLES was able, in 1960, to.create the Commercial hank of Haiti,
which he i cat the sole owner. Since its becinning, the Bank has been
an instrument for DUVALIER's financial manipulations, and CHARLES

is a subservient agent’ for the President in many of the. latter's
ptepcdar es operations conceived to evade U. S. Government surveillance.

LES, for example, was OUVALIER's agent in the operation designed |

to Saugele surplua U. S. military aircraft to Haiti and, in fact
made a trip to s USAF base in Arizona to effect: purchase, which
later blocked, After long, close association with DUVALIER, during
which CHARLES had become extremely wealthy, he managed to: incur. oe
DUVALIER's displeasure. Gradually. cHartes? influence diminished in’
favor of He SICLAIT, Director of the Regie de Tabac. As CHARLES -
. began to realize that he no longer enjoyed DUVALIER‘s favor, he
began, for the second or third time, to seek. channels to the

UB. S. Government and to solicit support for cemeete
the President.

2. faanee  Geptack CIA contact with CHARLES in: ae U.S, dates ~
back to May @ was visited in his a in the Hotel Willard
in Washington bys representative of WH Divi. ~Sinee that time, -|
he has mide his every. visit to the-U.S. an oecosion to'talk.to some”
official of the U. 3. Government. . The most persistent of his.
approaches has been meade to DC3/New York, which.
to the Department of Defense. Never has thts uriserupulous, overlye.
ambitious charlatan offered any evidence it he has anything going *.
for him inside Haiti, The names he he tntshed his alla,

the way of hard ‘@ reports, passed to DCS/NY through’
his business representative in New York, have been. evasive and, in-vome
inetences, utterly falee. Fabrication . in. some. cases, beon. obvious.

3. in brief, CHARLES ‘ig trying to-coerce the U..3. “Government:
into some. sort of oupport. for his presidential mepirectgne. i Should
