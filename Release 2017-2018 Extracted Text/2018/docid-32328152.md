Referenced New York letter sets forth a substantial Tkach “Ou

amount of information furnished by PCI EUGENE P, KEANE con- .
cerning American gambling activities in Cuba.as well as Ameri-
ean gamblers in Cuba. For the assistance of the New York Of-
fice in evaluating information furnished by KEANE, it should
be noted that the majority of the information set forth in
referenced letter has been previously furnished to the Havana
Office by sources considered reliable. It appears that when

‘ this PCI furnishes information concerning which he has per-
sonal knowledge, the information furnished is reliable. It
should be noted, however, that in furnishing opinions con-
cerning individuals he tends to state generalities which are
not true. :

Pages 7 and 8 of referenced letter make reference to
information furnished by NY 1894-C i dicating that informant
had been iptroduced by-HENRE_“RUSTERSSOELL to a,Cubaw, referred
to as Mr. SQUE."" Informant was unable to further identify
"BOSQUE,'" For the information of the Bureau and New York,
"BOSQUE". is believed to be identical with FREDESVINDO ISQUE,

“A CUETO, FBI Number..420934, This individual has been associated
,  °® “weth=Cuban gambling since the early 1950s. He was an important

fore hotel gambling was legalized. In addition, he has been
associated for many years with gambling operations at the
Oriental Park Racé Track, He is a known associate of some
of the more important American gambling figures in Havana.

for forwarding by the Bureau to New York. GS
