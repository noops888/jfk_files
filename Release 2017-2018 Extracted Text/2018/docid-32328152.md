ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

1182720)

1958.

Referenced New York letter sets forth a substantial

amount of information furnished by PCI EUGENE P. KEANE COn-

cerning American gambling activities in Cuba as well as Ameri-

can gamblers in Cuba. For the assistance of the New York Of-

fice in evaluating information furnished by KEANE, it should

be noted that the majority of the information set forth in

referenced letter has been previously furnished to the Havana

Office by sources considered reliable.

It appears that when

this PCI furnishes information concerning which he has per-

sonal knowledge, the information furnished is reliable:

It

should be noted, however, that in furnishing opinions con-.

cerning individuals he tends to state generalities which are

not true.

Pages 7 and 8 of referenced letter make reference to

information furnished by NY 1894-C indicating that informant

had been introduced by HENRY "BUSTER! BELL to a Cuban, referred

to as Mr.

"BOSQUE." Informant was unable to further identify

"BOSQUE.

"For the information of the Bureau and New York,

With Cuban gambling since the early 1950s. He was an important

figure in the old National Casino in Havana which operated be-

fore hotel gambling was legalized.

In addition, he has been

associated for many years with gambling operations at the

Oriental Park Race Track. He is a known associate of some

of the more important American gambling figures in Havana.

Two extra copies of this letter have been prepared

for forwarding by the Bureau to New York.
