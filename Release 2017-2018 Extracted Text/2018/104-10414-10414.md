We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

GIA aid produce one very significant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD nade froa soaeplace
in Mexico City to the Soviet Embassy there, using his ova maze. Speaking
broken Russian and using bis true nase, OSWALD was talking to the Eubessy
gvard, OBUISDY, wo often anevers the phous. OSWALD sald he haa visited
the Inbasay the previoas Saturday (28 September 1963) and spoken to a
consul whose name he had forsotten, and wio haa prowised to send a tele-
graa for bim to Washington. Be vented to knov if there vere “anything

Our Joint center produces great =

fiesses of telephone intercepts which are transcribed and reviewed by ow
a

small staff in Hexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone converaa-
tion of 1 October had been transcribed and a summery of it cabled to
Washington, The name Lee CSHALD meant nothing special to cur Hexico
City Station, but in their report they aia judge him to be on American
nale.

‘The cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked
in our files, where it was imnediately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning
‘the Soviet Rubassy in Hexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD vho had
defected to the Soviet Unton in 1959 and returned to the USA in 1962. on
10 October 1963, the day after the repart from Mexico City, CIA Headquartera
sent out @ cabled report about Lee OSWALD's phone call to the Soviet
Enbessys the report vent to the FBI, the Departuent of State (because
OSKALD was a US citizen), end to the Havy Departuent (because he vas a

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the

SEGEET


13-00000

liklihood that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of this same cable was delivered by hand to the Inmaigration and
Naturalization Service, with which we have no cable Link. ‘The sane day
a long cable vent out to Mexice City informing our Station of the beck |
ground of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for more information. Our Station
vas instructed to pass its information on the phone call to the Kexico
City officea of the FAI, the Embassy, the Naval Attache, and the Iprigra-
SE arora ‘Tole was done.

In its original report of 9 October, Mexico City had said it had a

photograph of an apparent American male leaving the Soviet Eubessy on

1 October 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation

in Mexico City provides us with secretly taken photographs of many but not
all visitors to the Soviet Eubesay there, teken with telephoto Lenses.
Accordingly, ve cabled the Bavy Department o1 24 October 1963 asking for
8 photograph of Lee OSWALD frou his Marine Corpe days 80 we could compere

photos. We hea not received this photograph by 22 Hovenber 1963, but in

any event, it turned out that the man photographed outside the Soviet



13-00000

Bubassy wes not OSWALD anyway. As chance would have it, none of our

several photo obsepation points in Mexico City had ever taken en tdenti-
flable picture of Leo OSKALD.

Our Mexico City Station very often produces inforaution Like this
on US citizens contacting Soviet bloc eubassies in Mexico City. Frequently
the information we get 1s extremely incriminating, ana on one or two
cccrsions we have even been able to apprehend and return to the USA
Averican military personnel who are attempting to defect. In all such
cases, our Hesdquarters desk requeste and obtains the special permission of
the Deputy Director for Plans to pass the derosatory information on a US
“citizen to other goverment agencies. Derozatory information on Americans
4e not treated routinelys in each case the DDP or his Assistant personally
scrutinize the information, make sure it 1s credible, anf decide vhether and
to whom it will be pasped. Only in absolute exergencies is the Mexico City

Station authorized to pass such information directly to the FBI office in
e '

the U.S. Enbassy.

At this writing (13 Decenber 1963) we ¢o not know what action the FBI

“SEGRE

ana other agencies may have taken based on our report. We surmise that the
FBI may have made local checka through Mexican authorities to cee if

Tee OSWALD was actually in Mexico City on 1 October. Indeed, later in-
Yestisation has confirmed all the details of his trip, where he stayed,
end vat he did To avoid crossing Lines vith the FBI, our Mexico Station

Soviet Consular file on OSWALD which had been publicly given by the Soviet
Ambassador to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy
Attorney General Xatzenbach invited us to review the FBI's comprehensive
report on the case to make sure our sources vere not jeopardized and that
our informition vas correctly quoted. We found the report highly
interesting and no threat to cur security, as long as it vas read only
by the authérized investigative bodies.

After the first fev days, the CIA investigation of the case was

bandled at Headquarters by a small staff usually charged with Anvestization

and analysis of the most important security cases, and by a few officers

and analysts of our Western Heslsphere Division.

‘says he needs a visa to go to Odessa. Man answering saya he should call

15-60-55 and ask for the Consul. Caller asks for the address, and it ip

Soviet official, vho takes her telephane nusber and promises to call her
back. Silvia DURAN conclndes this cali by telling the Soviet she herself
has boved and gives her new address for the Soviet Bubassy bulletin. He
asks her to phone (Sergey Eemenovich) KUKBARENKO (Second Secretary who puts
out the Bulletin) to give bim the vew address and he asks vho the Cuban
Cultural Attache is, Silvia DORAN gives the Attache's name as Teresa

that the wait vas senetines four or five months. The "American" haa
shovn the Soviets @ letter shoving he vas a meaber of an organization in
favor of Cuba and had claimed that the Cubans could not give him a viss
without @ Bussian vise, Silvia DURAN rejeins that they have the same
problems the “American” is still at the Consulate; they cannot give him a
transit visa unless he 4s assured of a Soviet visa, even though be just
vants to go to Caba tollait there for bis Soviet visa to be granted. He’
Fe eee ‘They ena the conversation on this note.
Silvia DURAN says that she will note this on his “card,” and the Soviet
concludes by saying, “Besides be is not knewn." He excuses bisself for the
Anconventence he has caused and Silvia DURAN says 1¢ 1s all right.

28 feyteuber - Silvia DUGAN eats the Soviet Isbasay from the

knows that. The American then says, somewhat enimatically: ‘er dia not
imow it then. I went to the Cuban Bubassy to ask thes for ny address
Decause they have it.” Me Soviet dnvites hin to stop by again and give,
them the address, and the Anerican agrees to do so. (In this conversation,
the American was speaking hardly recognizable Russian.)

As far as our records shov, OSWALD dia not phous the Soviet or Cuban
Rabasstes again until Tuesday 1 Octoter 1963. ‘the intervening days vere a
Sunday and a Monday. The contents of his later calls seem to show. be
aia not contact the Soviets on those days.

parts of the evidence indicate to the contrary. Silvia DURAN and the

13-00000

Soviet Consular triainls spas ef hia an a nen vith “no friends in Cuba"
on the one hand, and es a man not “known” in the Soviet Bubassy, on the
other. ‘he very openness of his visita and the phone calls speak ageinst any
ee His trip to Hexico was not Steel? 9 secret acts be travpled
under his real name or 9 close variant of it, lived openiy in Mexican
hotels, and corresponded with the Boviets through the open mallfi about

it waea be got back to the US. Hie trip to Mexico was apparently nade
necessary because it was the nearest Cuban diplomatic installation where

he conla apply for a visa.

A perplexing aspect of OSWALD's trafficking with the Cubans and
Soviets in Mexico City ts his assertion in his call of 28 September that he
ata not imow his sdéress when he vas at the Soviet Consulate and case to
the Cuban Consulate beceuse they bad ite Tt de hard to explain just vat
he meant, but it should be remesbered that he wea talking in Russian, a

his new address in Texas, whatever it wes, and may not have been able to

&


13-00000

lay hands on it when he was in the Soviet Consulate that day. Perhaps
he had earlier given the addrese to Silvia DURAN and wanted to look it
‘up on her card.

A particularly Beers eeeerierienniaee dealings vith the Soyjets
in Mexico City arises from the liklihood that he net vith Servlet Consul
Yelerdy Vladimirovich KOSTIXOY. In his 1 October phene call to the
Soviet Embassy, the guard OBYEDAOY suggests that the Consul OSWALD had
talked to wee KOSTIKOY if he was dark. OSWALD seems to agree with this,
but the identification is very casual. In his 9 Novenbes letter to the
Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD gives the nane of the man he’ dealt
with as "KOSTIH,” but there is no person of that eract naze in the Soviet
Embassy in Mexice City. KOSTIXOY is accredited as a Consular Attache and
does actually do a lot of consular work, but he is believed to be a
Soviet XGB officer, and it is believed that be works for Departuent 13 of

the KGB, the Departnent charged with nabotege and assassinetions. ‘The
" ' wy

suspicion that KOSTINOY 1s a KGB officer arose from his work habits, and

his association with other KGB officers. It was hardened when it was



13-00000

found that he handled a Seviet agent vio vas trained to do sabotage —

work and that he turned this agent over to another KCB officer who is

definitely known to work for the 13th Department. It is generally true
tn RGB vork that sabotage agents are handled ouly by 1S"Department 9,
officers.

Exbassy guard Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOY is hiuself believed to be a
KGB man from previous assignments as a bodysuard and sureillant. But
unless some direct evidence of Soviet complicity is discovered, it is
most likely that OSWALD's dealing with KOB men OBYRDKOY and KOSTIKOY vas
nething nore than a grim coincidence, a coincidence due in part to the
Soviet habit of placing intelligence men in the Eubassies in positions
where they receive a larga portion of the visitors and phone calls. All
of the five consular officers in the Soviet Enbasay are known or suspected |
intelligence officers. Certainly if OSWALD bad been a Soviet ayent in
training for an assassination assignment or even for sabotage vork, the

‘
EA ene

the Soviet Eubassy in Mexico after he tried it a couple of tines. Our


13-00000

experience in Mexico, studying the Soviet intelligence service at close
range, indicates that they do make some mistakes and are soxetimes insecure
in their methods, but that they do not persist in such glaring errore.

Some insight on the Cuban attitude tovard the arrest of Stlvin DIRS a
eon
and the invelvesent of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained frou two intercepted phone calls made between Cuben Presigent
Osvaldo DORFICOS ana Cuban Aubassedor to Mexico Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas oa
26 cHovember 1963, the day after Silvia DURAN was released fron her first
arrest. At 09:40 AM that morning, President DORTICOS phoned the Ambassador
frou Havana and asked him several questions about a report which the
Apbassador bad cent in on the exrest of Silvia DURAY and the Lee OSWALD
case. ‘The vhole conversation is coasistent vith the theory that OBWALD
Serely vauted a visa. ‘The Anbessedor did mention the altercation which
OSWALD bad with Consul AZCUB, end he says that Mexican police braised
CRORE OPED roi eo eee

‘ t
of their questions. Tkey haa asked her if she haa been intimate with

OSWALD end she bad denied it. President DORTICOS twice asked Ambassador



13-00000

HSRNANDSZ whether the Meccican police had asked Silvia DURAN questions
about “roney,” and the President apparently wanted to know whether the

Mexicans thought the Cubans had paid OSWALD money. MBSRHAHDRZ insisted

the Mexicans’ had net offered Stivia DURAI money, and DORTICOS gave p 5
up trying to yut acrose his point.  Fresident DORTICOS instructed
ESRYANDRZ to keep on questioning Silvia DURAN and to phene hin beck.

At 7:39 PH that evening Ambassador HERNANDEZ did call President
DORTICOS back, saying he had questioned "that person” asain and she has
nothing nev to add. President DORTICOS returns to the iosus of whether
“they had threatened her so that she vould make a statement that the
Conmilate hea given poney to the mants"that Azerican.” But Aubassador
EERUAHDRZ persists in misunderstanding DORELCOS, answes in the necative,
eae "Absolutely nothing vas given to her." DORTICOS seems to give
up, and the conversation dies out after a fev more general remarks.

We do not knew for sure vant mae President DORTICGS press for informa-

io ‘ 1
tion about Cuban money passed to OSWALD, but rumors vere current in Mexico

end even, we understand, in the USA, that OSWALD bad returned from Mexico

City with about $5,000. Perhaps DORTICOS was trying to learn whether
the Mexican police believed that the Cubans had financed OSWALD. In any
event, the Cuban Goverment sent the Mexicans a stiff note of protest

over the arrest ana detention of Silvia DURAN, but the Mexicans

es

Tejected the note.
