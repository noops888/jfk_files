ZMISTOWSKI, CHASTINE, BROZ, FOREST JONES and

LEO ANDERSON said they would advise regarding any infor-

mation coming to their attention concerning 1902 Notre

Dame Boulevard, Lake Worth, or persons associated there-

with. I

Miami will be alert for opportunity to utilize

confidential investigative techniques at that home. "

It is believed that logical leads concerning

that residence and the Sea Breeze Motel, Palm Beach,

looking towards linking subject with their ownership,

have been exhausted in the Miami area insofar as the

history of those places are concerned, and future

investigation will concern current activities at 1902

Notre Dame Boulevard, Lake Worth. U

JOHN R. DAY, Attorney, City Center Building,

Lake Worth, Florida, interview of whom was reported on

the administrative pages of referenced report of SA KELLOGG,

advised on May 8, 1961, on viewing photographs of KRUSE,

BURNS and GIANCANA, that KRUSE and BURNS are the persons

with whom he has done business

in the past but he has

never seen GIANCANA. He said he saw KRUSE at the First

Federal Savings and Loan Association, Lake Worth,

subsequent to his last being interviewed and also

suggested that BURNS used to frequent the famous restaurant

in Lake Worth where EDDIE BROZ, son of the owner, would

probably know him. U

On May 8, 1961, LEO ANDERSON, MM T-4 in instant

report, 1109 Verdun Street, Riviera Beach, Florida,

advised SAS RICHARD B. KELLOGG and ROBERT W. WISEMAN

that he used to do lawn work for LESLIE KRUSE at KRUSE's

home on Seminole Avenue, Palm Beach, Florida, and obtained

that job by reason of the fact that he was working on the

lawn next door. About four years ago, KRUSE indicated

he could get ANDERSON work tor a couple ot days a week at

a home in Lake. Worth, Florida, and at that time

ANDERSON started doing yard work at 1902 Notre Dame

Boulevard, Lake Worth. ANDERSON said he works there

abaut 2 days a week and when he went there he was told

just to do his work and not ask any questions and that

is what he has done. U

ANDERSON said when he first started working

there, there was no one there and the home was all closed

maintenance on KRUSE's home in Palm Beach and now takes.

overseer and has been there almost continually since that

time, and now pays ANDERSON for his work. He said the

hu he han not grant that no o

could very well be someone there without his knowing it,

but to his knowledge the last time there was a group of

people there was last New Years, when there was a group

and BURNS was there once this summer reportedly looking

into the possibility of installing central heating and

air-conditioning in the house, but those are the only

persons he has seen this year. He said BURNS always

stays with FIORE when he is in town relative to the house,

and he never knew BURNS to be at the house for any

reason other than contemplated repairs or maintenance. U

ANDERSON said he never did know who owned

that house and never asked any questions about it. He

said he did not know how FIORE got his job there, but

added he is always there and ANDERSON could recall his

leaving for a day or so on only one occasion since he

arrived there. He said the only car FIORE has is a Ford

Station Wagon and he does not. associate a new Thunderbird

with that house. He said since FIORE started paying him,

he sometimes pays in cash and sometimes by check, but

ANDERSON did not know who signed the checks or what bank

they were written on. He said he just cashes them at the

A and P Store in West Palm Beach and pays no attention to

any of the particulars of the check. u

ANDERSON identified photographs of KRUSE and

BURNS, but could not identify a photograph of GIANCANA.

He agreed to be of assistance in this matter insofar as

his limited access to that property will allow.

A PCI

case is being opened on ANDERSON and only limited portions

of the information furnished by him are being set forth

in the details, in an effort to protect his identity.

Present indications would indicate ANDERSON will be the

closest thing to a source at that address. u
