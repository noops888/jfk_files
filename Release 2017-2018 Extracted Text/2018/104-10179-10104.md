list of Cubans, presently asscoiated with the Castro regime, who aro 7

critical of Castro and might ba eensidered potential dsfectors; (2) to
er inside or ostside the island, who could be 62 :

of an inaurreetionary ‘movement. :

Since I had arranged to return to Washington on the sane day, I did
not give Ray-muck vime to do a thorough job. However, he was able to
furnish me with a list of nases, covering pointe (1) and (2). He prorteed
to provide me with additional irformaticn after checking with some of bis
tociated in Mew Yerk ard Miami. His thoughts on the possibility of an
ingurrectionary movement ill be the subject of # separate menorandun.
