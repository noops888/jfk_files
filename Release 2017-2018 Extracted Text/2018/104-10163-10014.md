often w= he oad. in feet, breakfaated with theAZCUE family that aay. Te39
Fecelied that atcne tine some montas earlier AZCUE hed told him, "Let's qui:
kidding ourselves, the Anericans are berter people than ve are t= they are
more generous and more husan,,." but went on to express violent hatred for the
Pentagon and the U.S, Government in esaeray ch he iiames for supporting
Gorrupt regimes throughout the hemi spherey) (L-9) cays that AZCUE is not a
Communist (he is sure of that) and that Us wifé is anti-Communist, They have
three children that he knows of, two boys now studying in Cuba and a girl

who 1s apparently withthem in Mexico, One of the boys was born in Spain,
AZCUB has indicated to/(L~v) that he would like to leave the Poreim, Service

5. Xt is tr be noted that on lo August (according to WAVE 2675) AZCUE
told AMOT=106 he would soon be departing for Cuba PC3 with hia wife and tuo
daughters,

6. Tas Station will not make any attempt to digent the voluminous file
on AZCUE at thia time; rather, it is ated that LIMASK-1 be consulted
Feearding Rie kncviedge of AZCUB,O1f (CASAS) 19 truly confident that he oan i
seeruit AZCUE, the Station would weleome his presence in Mexico City for euch dn
attempt; if he blunts hia lence we will b-

Rone the worse for the wear and, if
he is successful, we will have a agent either inside the Embassy or inside
Cuba,
