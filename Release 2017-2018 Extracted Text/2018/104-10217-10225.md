STFLIMFLAM training program to be conducted It is
our opinion that in order for this training to be of maximum
benefit, QRPRONE/1 jought to be ensconced in a
esafehouse facility which provides security, comfort id an
atmosphere conducive to learning. It is important that the
training be couduc in @ locale which will allow QRPHONE to give

SUBJECT: Meeting with QRPHONE/1

“2. 2 met with QRPHONE/1 for much of the 12th of July

and wearing two hats. Wo first went through tho third phase

of the training exercise in which I had been playing the role

of an agent prospect whow he was to assess and recruit, and then
later in the OTR safehouse I identified nysolf as the Headquarters
officer responsible for his project. Incidentally, he did an
excellent job in all three phases of the training exercise and
aid particularly voll on the recruitment itself. QRPHONE/1 is
clover, imaginativo, has an excellent grasp of this espect of
tradecraft and handled himsolf particularly well in a » complex

and ‘hanging training scenario.

3. As the Headquarters staff officer responsible for his
grosect. X¥ described in dotail the reasons for the long, sorious
ook at hig performance these last several months, the changing
intelligence and operational requirements we face, and the care—
ful gerotiny he had been given as we bogan to map out new direc-
tions for him, all of which ended with this advance four-week
training progran, testing, and evaluation and substantive
briefings, ‘He said he was a bit confused by the WOMUSE brief-
ing of last week so I explained how that tied in with this evoning's
planned discussion on the China progran.

« 3. We discussed his itinerary, personal plans and tne”
" pacing ef the next several months, all of which wero clarified
to bis satisfaction.

8. He will be debriefed on 24 July at 1000 hours at
the OTR safesite Lrecna Pontoning his return from the
eerie trip around the country. i

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Final Contact with QRPHONE/1

1. As arranged previously, I set with QRPHONE/1 at
the WOHOLD safesite from 1000 hours to
1230 26 July. The meeting was intended to urap up loose
ends, convey our decision to pursue the STFLIMFLAM prograa
(providing QRPHONE/1 bimself was amenable), and to make
clear that we expect measurable operational progress withi.
the next year. ve

2. Although QRPHONE/1 had been debriefed on 24 July
by other Headquarters officers regarding hb: trip around
WOCORK, I asked him to review it aguin for wy information
go I could put it clearly in perspective as it related to
our plans for him in the coming year. I'1l not bother with
the detsils here because such have already been written for
the record elsewbere, but suffice it to say that QRPHONE/1
was both pleased and relieved at the reception he got from
his old contacts because of the reilection these receptions
had om bis own bona fides. The allegations of his BKTRUST
affiliation which had floated throuzh Burope were never
mentioned by his WOCORK contacts; on the contrary at least
one of them urged GRPHONE/1 to return soon to HOCORK because
this is where the action is. This same individual gave
QRPHONE reading materiale on the Coanunist dialectic and
urged hin to study thea closely. This greatly impressed
QRPHONE because it showed how accurate were the briefings
given hia by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM officer and
demonstrated that ve knew our tactics.

3. I them reviewed with QRPHONE/1 the reasons for our
long close scrutiny of him and bis performance these last
weveral months followed by our selection of him for advance
training, testing, and redirection in the strong hope we had
that be would accept this new task because of its priority
importance to our national collection requirements. I asked

QRPHONE/1 his impressions of it all, bis reaction to the
ST¥LIMFLAM proposal, and whether he would accept its
demanding obligations. QRPHONE said he certainly would
and that he found it a real challenge to his intellect and
his operational skills. The tedious rtudy of the dialectic
would not deter him. His only concern was how he should
actually play it as he developed relationships with .
Qppropriate party mewbers and, ultimately, the Chinese in

« .I pointed out he needn't concern himself with
the last point because tbat would be part of the purpose
of the ten-day training program in SMORANGE in September
which would be given him by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM
officer. I said the training would require total emersion
for ten days straight, probably in some secluded beach
houge on the coast where all involved could reside full
tine. He said th uld present no problea cover-wise;
he would 2; 1_his family he had gone to the continent.
I gaid tha jwould be workiag out the details of
this with hin, pro! ly after bis return from vacation.

4. I said that given QRPHONZ/1's past performance,
his credentials with the radical left, and his apparent
interest in vigorously pursuing the STFLIMFLAM program we
expected to be able to measure in six to eight months the
likelihood of his being able to achieve all the STFLIMFLAM
objectives based upon the progress he would have made by
then with bis contacts. Should it appear that the
STFLIMFLAM operation would not succeed we would be discussing
alternative courses of action with him by the end of the
year. He dic say that of all the countries in Europe where
bis STFLIMFLAM and radical left potential is probably the
best, Italy would be first and Denmark second.

5. XE told QRPHONE/1 that his meeting with
had been moved to 31 July as he requested, reviewed his
European vacation plans and his Malta trip and wished hia
the very best of luck. At this point QBPHONE/1 certainly __.

WOGEAR Review of African Liberation Movements

~ In general, the author has done a reasonably good job

. describing the i:istorical development of the various African

liberation movements, especially when one considers the com-

plexity and number of splits and mergers that have occurred
_ Within and among the movements over the years. There are

several glaring inaccuracies, however, in the author's con-

clusions about the current position and effectiveness of the
, Beveral Portuguese African liberation movements.

i Regarding Angola, the author characterizes the MPLA as an
Adeologically-oriented group (i.e., Soviet doctrine) that has

failed to grasp and utilize to its advantage the tribal realities

“that exist in Angola. The author fails to acknowledge, however,

_ that the MPLA has had some success, albeit limited, in building

‘@ movement that is national and multiracial in character rather

. than tribally oriented. Despite its urban intellectual leader-

ship, the MPLA has had some success winning local support ‘in

* yural eastern Angola.

sit By contrast, GRAE ranks a poor second. From inception,
its primary base of support has been the large Angolan refugee
‘population of Bakongo tribesmen who live in southwestern Zaire.
“| Although the organization has won some support among Bakongo aa
., kinsmen across the border in northwestern Angola, it has failed
to broaden its base because of its thinly disguised regional
-and tribal make-up. Moreover, Roberto's unwillingness to
delegate authority or compromise have produced chronic disputes
‘at the leadership level. The author's conclusion that GRAE is
a formidable force to be reckoned with in the future of Angola
- ds contradicted by the fact that the MPLA is by far the
largest and most effective of the three nationalist groups _
, Opposing the Portuguese in Angola.

MOZAMBIQUE

_. The present FRELINO leadership does not appear to be in the
state of disarray in 1972 that the author believes it is.
~ Although some differences undoubtedly persist, the present
leaders seem to have closed ranks somewhat since the departure
of Simango in late 1969. For the present, any internal squabbles
that may exist are not noticeably affecting FRELIMO's fighting’
abilities inside Mozambique. c

on QRPHONE,

: 1. Revolutionary Image: Discussed. briefly how it is

- obtained. Pointed out there is a pattern to it which is dis-
_cernable among revolutionaries. It is usually issue oriented
‘4m the beginning, the war being one of the key issues, and it
‘gradually evolves into a desire to engage in practical activities
-which usually expressed best on a continuing basis through work
in an organization. Also connected with this process. is the
gradual development of a different “outlook.” It is usually a
mixture of idealism and Marxism-Leninism-socialism-Mao Tse-tung
thought. Usually unstructured but developing.

- It is possible in this stage to move from one group to
another without any particular approbation being attached for
this transience. This is particularly s0 if one starts way
- outside a M-L-ist group and moves inward towards it. Quite

a different thing to start in a M-List group and go out.

‘ Also in development of a new outlook one comes to study

La variety of revolutionary literature, This can take one into

- different areas, anarchism, GW advocacy, revolutionary nihilism,
socialism, Marxist-Lenism, etc. However, to get to latter

it must be done logically.

2. Tightly Structured Op: Emphasis upon tight, controlled

-contacts which seek to accomplish a specific purpose--collection

of info not necessarily one nor always one. Purpose is to lay

ground work for future developments. Purpose to establish certain

contacts which can be later used in either positive or negative
fashion, Structured conversation is also essential. It too

- should seek to accomplish something, directed so as to be useful
to future development of op: e.g., desire to have an explanation

. for an action to be undertaken later--so bring up in conversation

with someone so that can use that conversation later as explanation

for interest in a subject, knowledge of a subject, etc. It is

“ checkable.

“3. Study: Most important aspect in opening phases of op.

“Without correct study and without development (understanding)

of “correct outlook" one will always be a dilettante to the,

;outside looking in, someone who is useful to them "under certain
:eonditions,” but not someone who is reliable, and not a dependable

*. wevolutionary. This is really the key, the ideological tool,

- 4t will open doors that cannot otherwise be entered.

4. Contacts: Those to be exploited now and those to be
used in or for future time. In the beginning the contacts which
are developed are to be used as a means of building his
‘justification for having begun the serious study of Marx,



“im Mao, etc. We can assume that through some of his activities

*. we go directly to the Chinese for help they can look in their

. Marginal intelligence, Must be prepared to sacfrice diversionary

“\ ment of op, otherwise it is pointless to undertake it. Tactics

’ phase should dovetail into the next. To some extent a general

, by step.

Lenin, and Mao,’ This mist be discussed with people so that many
are aware of it. These conversations will be later used when he
explains how and why and when he became interested.

5. Diffuse Nature of Op: In beginning op has a diffuse
nature. It is necessary to make many contacts. Some will be
more useful than others, but all have potential for use in
«me circumstance or another. Since we have no way of knowing
how or from whom the Chinese collect their intelligence, seek
out, or otherwise spot budding revolutionaries we can assume
that some one of his acquaintances will report his interest

Chine:

will build up his dossier so that at a later date when

dossier and see that x number of months ago, etc., various
things were reported. Etc.

- 6. Ops as a Process of Development: Permit no diversions
or detours which might become permanent. This would include
targets of opportunity, etc. Must always maintain correct
operational line and cannot reach target by following various |
diversionary tributaries in the temporary interest of collecting

line, must be cautious with this. Ops line serves as guide for
whole op from beginning to end.

%. Tactics in Op: Must always be carefully thought out so
“as to insure forward development of op. Something must be seen

are details. Details are most important aspect in day to day

running of op. They must be paid attention to, must be contrib-
utory, must be carried out in correct sequence, and we must keep
in mind that at one or more points it is these details which will

THAT THESE DETAILS APPEAR LOGICAL TO THIS OPPOSITION, even if they
may seem illogical to us at times. Our logic is not the same as

‘= - 8. Ops is Step by Step Process: Op should/or can be
divided into steps, phases, stages, segments, whatever. Each

outline can be developed. Each of the major phases should
- be sub-divided into stages so that they can be dealt with step ~
For example: Three broad categories:

‘Ist Phase: All initiatives are ours, We do all the work,
‘ay ground for future stages. We have a flexible line which

‘ permits making maximum contacts to be correctly exploited. We
it tote training. Also devise concrete activities for him to carry

2



Zu@ Paase: Chinese and others have shown interest, We
will exploit this interest. After he has completed first phase
we will begin to make structured contacts with the Chinese. In
these contacts he will show that he has a grasp of the ideology;
is interested in learning more, desires to study more intensively.
Will use as negative examples: his book, Panthers, some aspects
of Bergman's behavior, the unstructured and undisciplined nature

, Of most revolutionary activists in U.S., particularly among the
blacks, or whatever may seem appropriate at time contact is
made. However, will seek their help to further his study and ~
will indicate recognition of need to return to U.S, in order
to undertake correct role in revolutionary struggle. At this
stage we will have an idea of interest of Chinese. We will be
able to determine whether we can expect progress or not. If
they prove willing to help they will then be asked to guide
his further study, to help him. Through this help they will
be able to see the development which has taken place. We should
get a good feeling of their willingness to guide him after a
couple of meetings. If we are shut out then must make ops
judgement from that point on--can always target against Soviets
and use Chinese as negative example. If they are interested
we will then lose some aspects of our initiative, but in’ essence
the more initiative we lose to them, the more they try to

‘direct him, the deeper he becomes involved with them, which is
our objective--one of them. He must continue his study.

"8rd Phase: Continue his study; continue his contacts all
around, but by now should have significant contacts and can
dispense with the more general "sparrow" approach. Once certain
of their willingness to help we ask about a trip to Peking
to study after which he wants to return to U.S. and take active
role.

= Recognize that this may be a sticking point. We don't
want him here. However, this idea has to always be in the
forefront as far as the Chinese are concerned otherwise they
have little reason to be interested in him. This MUST appear to
be his goal. We may be able to circumvent it later for one
reason or another, or it might be useful to bring him back
temporarily. This decision must be reserved for that time.

“These stages and sub-stages must be further divided if
we are to understand the operation correctly and are to carry
at out correctly. Each action he is asked to undertake must
be seen leading to something concrete in the next or another
step. The whole op goes STEP BY STEP. We do not insert oe
unrealistic objectives, or those which would be desirable but
may be difficult. This is a waste of time. We only seek to
do what is possible--possible is what can be turned into reality.

‘1°: Emphasis must be made on "step by step" approach and must
be maintained. Otherwise we can trip ourselves up by trying to
accomplish something which is out of sequence FOR THEM. For

E example: He has read Marx and Lonin. We might say he's quite

7 familiar with it. We could then say that he will read Mao and
after that he will be able to pretend to be a Maoist. All of this
is true. He could say it’ and act like he and others thought

FE c a Maoist should act. However, appearance and essence are not

ae synonomous. It might appear to non=Maoists that our troop is a

i E Maoist because he can talk as good a game as anyone else--or

better than those who have not studied as uuch--but the essence

of being a Maoist is not contained in such superficialitTes. .

Nor is the essence of being a Marxist-Leninist so contained.

He cannot, for example, bloom or emerge as a Maoist and find

bane depen with the Maoists, They know the process it takes to

get ere: "Several years of assiduous study can produce good

eebulte,” (Some Chinese quote on studying Mao.)

- 9, Their Weapon is Also Our Tool: Once we understand
correctly how they wield their weapon, the dialectical method,

it can serve as our tool to pry our way into their camp.

Through proper study and understanding we can deve op and promote
Q's superiority among his friends and acquaintances. To Marxists
he will be much more acceptable and his intel product will
probably be enhanced since they will talk on subjects they might
not have touched upon in the past, he will be more trusted, and
also he will have better recognition of key developments in
Marxist world turough better understanding of their reality.

“10. Some activities which we might consider enroute.

Hee ersertiic a. Start His Own Study Group: Chinese would be very
interested. Unlike most study groups with which I am familiar
he would stress study of ideology--in correct way. However, to
prevent them from profiting from such study they can be tied in
knots for months dealing with a variety of ideological problems.

. There is no point in our developing for their use good

“revolutionaries. However, it would provide reason for frequent
./contact with Chinese in order for them to help him in the
development of his group. Would probably lead him into contact
with other interesting types. Might have it for “Americans
only" | abroad--to avoid problems with Brits: whatever:

b. Might Talk About Starting a One Man Institute for
: ipeaavaa African Revolution: could put out a four page broad-
‘eheet for peanuts. It would discuss various African problems. —
His book gives him good reason for such study. He might draw
. “one or two people to him. Can use this too as basis for approach
to Chinese. He will have come to recognize that he had not .
| painted the true picture of national lib struggle in his book
and through his broadsheet he seeks to rectify some his ideas.

©. He could seek to do another book on "The Dialectics
of African Revolution." Here again the help of various communists,
Marxist-Leninists, and particularly the Chincse in providing

“, guidance (correct guidance) would give him frequent access and

_ contact--providing the Chinese are willing to help.

“of radical U.S, types abroad. It would also have feed back
into the American scene and in part fulfill his requirement to
have an active role with U.S. revolutionary developments, Etc.
Etc,

at the sametime since much of it overlaps and is hence com-
patible, However, each must be structured, carefully handled,
. ‘With great attention to the details, STEP BY STEP.

‘i Some Words of Caution: Our experience clearly indicates
that it is incorrect to rely upon either the agent or the
station to provide the impetus. This seems to be true for a
number of reasons. Case officers change often, chiefs of ops,
bases, or stations change--there is not much continuity. We
are thinking of a long term operation which, as it grows,
becomes very complex. It is not easily understood by someone
who gets involved after it has been going for sometime. It is

. @ven more true of changes in station leadership whose attitude
is largely developed on his subjective feelings from reading
only cable traffic. The initiative, the opcrational ideas,
«ete. are best kept in Hqs. There is so much more information
~ here to work with, people with whom one can talk, staffs, etc.
Also most officers in the field simply do not have the time to
sit down and plan in the kind of detail that is needed to
continue and develop the op. It calls for solid knowledge of
, the communist reality in order to insure that no errors creep
.{in those contacts he may make. It calls for someone to have the
itime to read, study, certain publications, articles, etc,, and
then to figure out whether or not a given publication or article
>ecan be used to make a useful contact, write a useful letter, etc.
‘If so, how, and then go the field with the idea, and concrete
directions about how it should be used. Case officers most
likely won't be exposed to the same material and probably wouldn't
; have the planning time necessary, or the various resources of
Eqs to do what needs to be done. ee
This is not to suggest that the field has nothing to say.
_However, if the understanding can be clearly made that this is in
fact a joint operation, with Hqs having an opportunity for big
input, with the understanding that the only thing which matters
to all concerned is the correct development of the operation in
; the given concrete wnditions and not either the Hgs or the field
trying to establish some kind of supremacy of rights over the
other--there is a good chance of success.

Agent Profile - QRPHONE/1

QRPHONE/1 is on American citizen and a singleton agent
who has been a recruitea asset for some seven years. He has
extensive contacts among leftist, radical, and communist
movements in Europe and Africa and was able to/sustain bis
relations with many sucb figures for operational purposes
in spite of a formal disassociation some years ago.
Originally a member himself of a radical pro-communist
group, bis disenchantment with internal personal and
political dissension in an organization to which ne had
firmly committed himself led later to his acceptance of an
operational relationship with the Agency. Although tarzeted
after his recruitment at the plethora of new left and radical
elements in turope, essentially for intelligence collection
purposes, QRPHONE/1 has recently been redirected toward the
Chinese Communists with a view to ingratiating himself and
seeking their guidance and support as he demonstrates an
interest in more effectively acting on their behalf. Our
ultimate objective is to precipitate invitations to Mainland
China which will lead to successively higher echelons ot
contact within the Chinese Government.

To prepare ORPHONE/1 for this demanding task, extensive
retraining, assessment and reaotivetion were recently
eccomplished and selective recontact wi made by him with
bis more influential and pertinent communist contacts.
Reactions to QRPHONE/1's alleged desire to more fully commit
himself to the communist Chinese cause and the assistance
rendered thus far by these-communist contacts sre encouraging
paving td of the potential success of this agent to achieve
our goal.

Although a complex man to manage operationally because
of his own background and the mix of bis ideological and
professional motivations, QRPHONE/1's intelligence ana
personality are such as to well equip him to meet the
challenge of the tests the Chinese are likely to throw bis
way. He is based jas is his case officer, and
operational meetings” in secure safe sites, sometines

QRPHONE/1 has produced numerous intelligence reports
on communist and radical tarzets in addition to his covert
action functions as a journalist and author. His long-tera
tenure with the Agency wi determined in part by the degree
of success of his new ja

irections.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
. SUBJECT: Meeting with QRPHONE/1

—-

On 24 July 1972,/

[Ho the undersigned
lconverged on the OTR safesite in

to meet with QRPHONE/1 in order to debrief
him on his trip through WOCORK.

2. ‘The discussion was started by having QRPHONE
relate the details of his trip on a city by city basis
describing the people he met and his reception by them.
It should be noted here that several of the individuals
that QRPHONE was to have seen were out of town or
unavailable, however, QRPHONE will correspond with these
individuals in order to maintain his relationship with
them.

NEWARK

QRPHONE met with Leibel Bergman at his home
and stayed overnight (14-15 July) as his guest.
QRPHONE told Bergman that he had decided to make
a full-time commitment to the study of Marxist-
Leninist (H-L) doctrine in order to become more
proficient in M-L theory and would like to join
ee : the RU to further this ambition. Bergman's reaction,
| according to QRPHONE, was enthusiastic. Bergman
gave QRPHONE some M-L literature (which was the
same as the literature gave him several
weeks ago to study) which he felt would be helpful.
Bergman stated that if QRPHONE was really interested -
in becoming involved in the M-L movement he should i
return to WOCORK because that "was where all the
inconsistencies were." Bergman invited QRPHONE to

take part in some M-L study groups but didn't
say what exactly would be studied. The
following are some general comments QRPHONE
provided about Bergman. Bergman doesn't like
Newark, he has been mugged several times and
would like to go back to California; however,
that is not possible at this time, so Bergman
will instead move to New York City. Bergman
is pleased with the current development of the
RU. He said that the recent trip to China by
several RU members was successful and that the
trip had been pleasant for them. QRPHONE
commented that it appears that Bergman does not
have the same control of the RU that he formerly
had, although he is regarded as the "guru" of
the RU.

NEW YORK

QRPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting
to sell the English language rights of
Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA.
Ward had been trying to get Lyle Stuart to
purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy
toward Wilfred Burchett, "that old Communist"
according to Stuart, was too great. Burchett
apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't
want to publish anything with his name on it.
QRPHONE, in our presence, called Stuart and
convinced him to at least read the manuscript of
the book before he turned it down. Ward-has a
South Vietnamese student living with him as a
combination houseboy/companion. This student,
whose name is David Truong, is the son of the
South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong

Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 South Vietnames election

on a peace platform and who is now in prison.
QRPHONE said that this student has amassed a large
collection of books on intelligence, that the

books are expensive and that he doesn't have any
idea where the money to buy the books came from.

He also said he doesn't think Truong has
immigration. papers to stay in WOCORK legally. I
asked if Truong was in any way involved with the
recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE
stated that Truong knew the hijackers and might have
known something about the attempted hijacking
because the hijackers had also stayed at Ward's
apartment. :

NS ebanuyi

Ward is going to France soon for a vacation
with a girlfriend he refused to identify because a
he feels his apartment and phones are bugged
“by at least ten intelligence agencies." Before
he goes on vacation he intends to stop in Paris
and meet with DRV and PRG officials as well as
with Wilfred Burchett. (Ward also met with

rior to her recent trip to the DRV). q
Ward will try to visit.QRPHONE in London sometime #
in September before he returns home. Ward :

claimed that a "wealthy benefactor" gave him some 4
$1000 to cover the cost of his vacation. Ward {
himself is broke and makes only about et per i
week salary. A

i

DETROIT

QRPHONE was unable to see Milton Henry,
leader of the New Republic of Africa, who was on
vacation in Japan. He did manage to see
FNU Boggs, who is apparen:ly no longer involved
with radical organizations but who is acting as a
clearinghouse for black and white radicals. i
QRPHONE characterized Boggs as less doctrinaire "
and less dogmatic than he had been in the past.
Boggs’ feeling about the black radical movement
is that it is in considerable disarray.

CHICAGO

QRPHONE saw LPWEAKLY/1 who told him that he, i
was trying to get an invitation to visit China. 3
LPWEAKLY/1 told QRPHONE that if he went he would
see about taking him along. This was the first .
that QRPHONE knew about LPWEAKLY/1's plans. ~~
QRPHONE was unable to see either Sidney Lens or
Hal Block because they were out of town. He did
corroborate the fact that Block had recently
been to China. QRPHONE spent some time with
Don Wright, who was a member of the RU delegation
to China. Wright is now a full-time RU official
responsible for organizing RU cells in the
i i Mid-West and seems committed to revolution
although he doesn't speak in M-L terminology.
Wright stated that one problem now facing the RU
involves national exposure, i.e., getting
minorities to become involved with the RU. This
is a change from past RU philosophy which was that

Sema

i

aa Cee Wid Ak

'
winority groups should form their own
organizations separate from the RU. QRPHONE
said Wright is very bitter toward the Black
Panther movement and thinks that Eldridge
Cleaver is "bad" and that Huey Newton and
Bobby Seale are "corrupt".

SAN_FRANCISCO

In San Francisco QRPHONE stayed with Ee
Davida Fineman. The mysterious M, who appeared
in several of her letters to QRPHONE, is Martin
Nichols, a Marxist scholar of note who translated
into the English the entire Fundamentals of
Political Economy. He was once a member of the
De eeeasea rece eec ate

Emotionally, Davida is not as depressed as
she was several months ago, even though her brief
exposure to the world of labor union organizing
wes a failure. Her comments about the RU were
to condemn the Bruce Franklin group (Venceramos
Organization) which she said is going to bring
disaster to the whole RU because of its
predilection for violence before the groundwork
for revolution has been laid. Fineman feels that
Robert Avakian, a high RU official, is less wild
and erratic than in the past and has in fact
become a good M-L.

QRPHONE saw Paul Richards, Hodee Edwards’
son-in-law. Richards is a former CP member from
the Mid-West, which he left because of the people.
He feels that the Mid-West is a part of the
country where the Government ought to test nuclear
warheads. QRPHONE also met with Earl and Lee Rose.
Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he
must have caused some embarrassment to the
delegation by his naivete. He attempted to meet
African revolutionaries, particularly members of
the MPLA, which he didn't realize were Moscow~
oriented. Rose asked QRPHONE to write and send
him material on the various African liberation

movements. Lee Rose works for

although Earl, her husband, is unemployed.

ATLANTA

QRPHONE went to the Martin Luther King
Center for Social Change, formerly the Martin
Luther King Foundation, where he met with :
Tom Porter, the head staffer of the organization. i
There was recently a split in the Center and the
Executive Director, a Dr. Scott, was forced out
ef office. The office is still vacant and,
according to Porter, will remain so for the
immediate future. The reason for the continued
vacancy is apparently to allow Coretta King and
other members of the Board of Directors to ty
maintain direct control. Porter is a former fa
writer for Freedom Ways Magazine. QRPHONE said ',
that Porter knew of him but didn't say exactly how. a
QRPHONE told Porter he would consider writing a :
brief on the Center for LPWEAKLY. QRPHONE said
that the Center is going to establish a foreign
affairs staff which will be headed by Jack O'Dell, +
an old CP member. +h

3. After QRPHONE's discourse on his trip,

discussed in broad terms what he could expect in the

next year with regard to securing entre to the Chinese.

QRPHONE was told that once he was proficient in M-L

he would be expected to go out and test his knowledge

with various individuals and organizations in_order to He
gain access and become known to the Chinese.
emphasized it wouldn't be easy, that QRPHONE would have
to be diligent and patient, but that in the end, if he
was successful, the benefits would be many. QRPHONE
accepted this. te

ATTENTION:
SUBJECT: Completion of Training Re Report for QRFHONE/1,
‘raining Progran "
REPERENCE: Meno for Director of Training, From Chief,

Covert Action Staff, dated 23 May 1972;
Subject: “Covert Training for QRPHONE/1”

‘1. QRPHOUR/1 was trained covertly from 22 June to
1h July 1972. There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty-seven

training hours.

2. nis was a happy remion of trainee and instructor. Less than
tvo years ago, FiONE was given three days of reports training (Please
see Completion of Training Report dated 19 October 1970). Just as then,
FHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment
of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remembering that the
instructor does not eat lunch, PHONE brought a sandwich with him daily
end took this lunch while listening to the instructer. Thus, every
minute of every day was made to count,

3. The only time lost was three hours od EEE ea
several phone calls he had to make daily to re calls to his cover
office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his

office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls
took half an hour. n some days, they took far less.

4, His cover organization work took up ® considerable portion,
everyday, of his free time with the result that he could not do any
casing to speak of for subsequent preparation of coumo plans for exercises.
For exemple, told early on to prepare two dead drop conmo plans, he
was not able to cone up with anything till the lest week -- end then
with only one written one and one that he revéiwed orally, As a result
he had to be given time during the training day to write reports of
his countersurveillance exercises and one of his agent developmental
exercises. After one such exercise, asked if he wished to teke time
out during the training day to write his report he said: "No, tonight
I vill make time to write it.” And he did. And it was @ good report.

5. On each Sunday, he went out of town to visit his aged Grandmother.

He used the travel time to read tradecraft books (he read seven altogether).

Qn Tuesday, July 4th, his publisher appointed him baby sitter for the
Publisher's teen age son and there vent any hope of getting eny casing
done that day. At lesst one time, he nentioned that he did not go

to bed till two that morning and as he had left the afternoon before,

he had stated that he had meetings starting at four-thirty that afternoon.
With all that, he nevertheless was fully alert and attentive every minute
of every training session.

6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his
instructor played the role of operations officer -- and a real dub-
dumb he was. In such circumstances, PHONE had to do all the thinking,
all the planning, all the casing for meeting sites, all the analyzing,
all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment. It was pure joy
to watch this man, after each meeting and again before the next one,
go to work on the problem, He mew where he was, knew where he wanted
to go, knew how to get there. Wwhen| uring the critique
at the end of the series of exercises said je did a beautiful job,”
HONE had earned that accolade all by himself. The instructor's only
contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition.

7. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a low bow in
the direction of He played his agent role excellently well
and made thi @ meaningful one for PHONE. The three trips to

ust have been very taxing, particularly in view

of his immediately upcoming TDY trip, but they were efforts vell spent.

8, No man, of course, is perfect, Each has an Achilles heel, a
weakness, or an all-too-human trait, et the very least. Our PHORE has
his. He has a very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing it, he relies
on it, cots on it. This, in turn, leads to a small failure in self-
discipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment
pitch, he came in with six words (maybe not that many) scratched on a
3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook. He then proceeded, fron
these few vords, to ru off his plan without a single pause for en
uh, bm, er, etc. It was as though he was reading a definition frome
@ictionery, so smoothly did his mind end thoughts run, He prepares
everything ip.his mind, it eppears, and does not like to write out oa
thet which he feels he should not have to write out. While it is great
to heve so facile a nind, e bit of discipline, to write out in full
so important an ect es a recuritment pitch, might one day save grief
vhen an error vould have been spotted had the entire plan been written
out then looked over for possible flews.

9. ‘This small flew, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable
measure for Pu0ug's failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till

the lest days of the program. PHONE felt he could just as easily report
orally. In fact, the other dead drop (he hed been asked to do two)

on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the peper was in - .
front of him and he was reading from it. Nothing wes missing -- area

ECRET

“cc fULiRaeA Nr Dot a



description, access, hours of availebility, the opposition, pros and
cons as to suitebility -- it was all there. He just didn't like to
write out that upon which he could report orally.

10. In wriing reports on the two counter-surveillence exercises,
he dashed those off in jig tine. No pause for thinxing, no pause to
ook up at the ceiling or out the window. Just straight writing, includ~
ing paragraphing. Mind and pen were as one. Same thing for his oral.
analysis before and after each meeting -- no pause to think, to review,
to reconstruct, to remember -- just an IBM-type printout.

1. ‘The instructor sets dow this reluctance on our hero's part
to write out certain things, not to downgrade him, but to alert desk
and field officers that if they must have < certein report by a certain
time, and they want it in writing, they must be firm. For exemple, :
after the second meeting in the developrental series, the instructor i
said: "I must have that report first thing in the morning. Do you :
vant to take time out from this afternoon's training session to do it?” i
And, 26 already reported above, PHCNE preferred to seve the training }

time and he answered "I will make time to write it". In this case,

time was of the essence because| had to see the report before
the next meeting. To sum up this item: When PHOUE feels that an oral
report is adequate he finds it a little difficult to bring himself to
find time to make a written report. Told definitely that he must write i
@ report and given a deadline, he meets the deadline and the report is :

everything it should be. i

22, His reports on his recruitment meetings,[___ sala, were
excellent. No jumping to conclusions, no padding, no misinterpretations,
po omissions.

13. ‘The surveillance team captain, reading PHONE's report on his
actions during the countersurveillance exercises, narvelled at the
completeness, total accuracy of description of the surveillants PHONE
bad made, including their ages (but always made each man en inch or
‘two shorter than the actual height -- which PHONE admitted he does ol
constantly), and the total recall of every move, every street crossing,
every compass direction. (In the first coutersurveillance exercise,
sprung on PHONE without a moment's prior notice, he made one of his
two surveillants. In the second one, with plenty of time to prepare,
he made all three of them, These were two different teams from the

ce of Security). Concluding his admiration of PHONE's ‘
, the surveillance team captain seid to the instructor: "You

should be very proud of hin”. oe

Ak. In doth exercises, the surveillance teams criticized the
rapidity of PHONE's movements. He walks very rapidly from place to
place, then spends time to browse in a book shop. ‘Then off again at
a high rate of speed to his next stop. They also criticized his looking
‘both ways while crossing « one way street. ‘They felt it made him appear

he
tail conscious. These are a typical habits. ‘The instructor,
also is guilty of the identical actions. We are highly

kinetic in our movements end as for looking both ways while crossing a
one-way street, we follow the old Marine Corps adage: "There's always
one 5.0.B. that doesn't get the word", By sheerest coincidence, when
the instructor was on his way to the safesite to deliver the surveillance
team's report, he violated his own rule of looking both ways in crossing
@ one-way street and was bowled over by a hippie on a loaded bike --
going the wrong way. Only the large heavy film case the instructor

was carrying kept him from being knocked flat.

15. Nevertheless, POH is now fully cognizent of the appearance
thet his actions create and will watch it in the future.

16, One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: He
chose his positions well and he camouflaged his actions beautifully.
Qne example: The instructor called the surveillance team for a quick
feedback on the first exercise and caught the men just es they returned
to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.
‘They reported one incident as follows: “So repid were PHONE's novements,
that when he net a friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with him,
just waved him off". The second surveillant: "Ho, it didn't look like
that at all, to me, To me it looked like this Indian-looking person
stopped FHONE and asked him for directions and PHONE gave them and just
vent about his business". PHO!R's own report, vhich he wrote up before
he learned about the tvo different interpretations of the incident:
“eee where I stopped a foreign-lookxing man, epparently Indien in origin
and asked hin for the Museum which I knew perfectly well is on 55th
Street. I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted
the same man in the grey suit, nov holding his hat in his hand".

17. In the second exercise, there were two items of note: One,
the team was surprised to note in FONE's report that PHONE even had
the name of the book that the surveillant picked up when he folloved
PHONE into a book store. Second, when the exercise was over, the team
compared notes and decided that PHONE may have made two of them but
could not possibly have made the third man. The team captain, on reading
FHONE's report, was stunned to see that PHONE hed indeed made the third
man also, but good.

18, PHONE hed en elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop-
quisition series) with| instructor in the
ffice. After relating the fine Job that FHOWE had done|
report concluded: "A first rate performence by PHONE, WHO'S
yisly been around ~~ both coverwise and for real”,

19. His choice of meeting places with his agent could not be
faulted. For one, he chose an East Side restaurant (where diplomants,
es held himself out to be, would properly be seen dining).

Yet it was far enouzh away from the United Netions building to lessen

the chances that PHONE himself and his putative diplomat terget would
be spotted by 2riends or acquaintances. His choice for the next meetiny
” 1

This restaurant wes
ated in the safesite corplex. He was thus able very smoothly to
invite his agent to the cafesite from the restaurant for the recruiting
pitch.

20, He did very well in executing two recognition meetings and

two brush passes. He had no time to write his own commo exercises

(as stated, he was able to write up only one deed drop commo plen)

80 he was given como plans written up by another trainee. To give him
veriety, he was alternately the higher and the lower echelon, alternately
accepted and made the hand-off,

21. In operational and intel reports, he did very well. He very
successfully separated the operational from the intel info and the
source comments from the positive intelligence.

22. Instructor's Observation: PHONE is a proud man, both as an
individual and as an operator. While he was very discreet about it,
very circumspect, he did, nevertheless, let the instructor know that
the has, on occasion been handled with sonething less then pure genius.
‘This, like the previous item, is noted not to dow-grade PHONE, but to
slert both desk and field officers that this man, being very sure,
positive, definite end strong, hopes to be handled in a manner that
would have those same words epply.

23. In sum: A very good man.

2h, In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training,
we would appreciate a detailed evaluation report in July 1973 from the
field station. This report should indicate the extent to which the
training has made the trainee a more useful and effective asset and
should eveluste the performance in each area of tradecraft in which
training was conducted; negative as well as positive comments are
solicited. ‘The field station's report should also include the trainee's
wm comments. Please ask the field station to slug the report WOMOLD/

this basis. His overt political orientation is described

as “radical,” but it is an intellectual "radicalism,"
not revolutionary. Further, he is basically a theoreti-
eian not a personal activist by nature. He might be
asked and might undertake an activist role—-but it is
felt that it would not sit naturally upon him and
would probably not achieve whatever acceas might have
been postulated. Within his theoretician, non-activist
context it was nevertheless felt that the probably-to-
be-expanded field of Chinese Communist activities in
Zurope provided the focus which might most usefully be
explored. The expansion of Chinese Communist activities
ip Europe may come quite slowly but, in view of the
probable shortage of assets in this field, it was a
matter on which we should have some patience. It is
also x field which could be explored without QRPHONK's
eeding to move. Whether he focusses on this field or
another, hovever, QRPHONE needs to develop some job

oF organizational base which will make him interesting
as a target himself to those we wish to focus him on.
At the present time hie cover does not provide a power
or influence base and he is essentially completely
Gependent upon us.

took place, I am not aware of the extent to whith there

gay, they have decided field implications in which
LEPIPIT needs to be consulted, should they be pursued.

AGENT EVALUATION

NAME: QRPHONE/1 DATE: 18 January 1971

PROJECT: QRPHONE STATUS: Contract Agent (Under

aceeTenTaE a Memorandum of Oral
Agreement)

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
ncluding Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/l's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and
without posing problems for his handler. His personality is
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not
always totally successful -- leaving us with tantalizing bits
of information and many unanswered questions ~- this is generally
due to opexational circumstances in which he was simply unable
to elicit more information on a given subject,

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
‘as a journalist. He has acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself
has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
under Wotivation.

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/1's attitude is good. He has made

ft an effor oO ‘Scharge part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasm,

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on
which a good deal has beenmid over the course of this operation.
The following points can be made on the subject of Q/l's
motivation:

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

SECRET

i
i
4



i SECRET ~

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional
organization has been enhanced in.Q/1's case by the
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handling. Indeed Q/1 has probably come
to hold a rather glamorous "storybook" image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti- =
SKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to
accentuate the feeling on his part on being a member of
@ very ilpressive outfit.

Cc. In his political evolution over the years, Q/l
has become active in at least two “causes". In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel “involved” in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as “squealing” on his friends -- indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/l was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid
him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to
be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F, Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1
clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international
issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which
he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these
several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.

of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at
Q/1, but as far as Q/l can determine (and this is not a subject
on which he can come right. out and ask a direct question) she

i that Mrs. Q/1 nd. is the holder of some rather
} typical “left” anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should aiso be noted

that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety

of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed --
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of

stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
persona y and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
@ most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism -- provided it is onstructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
im. m this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
Press for all the desired details.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has
Signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/l is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1.has a good sense of personal security and his
andler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

“ SECRET “4

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/l's
affiliation wit NCE, many pré-dating his actual recruitment,
add an cxtre dincasiou .o QYi's cover situation. We have. no
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof,

nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of
contacts.

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can
‘work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative
wurden. fe is not overly concerned about his administrative
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely
expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the
rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,
he can be very upset.

REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective
“——“yeporter -- both in terms of ability to elicit and writing
style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURAXTE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue
his efforts on a sustained basis.

LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French,
“——Ttalian and German,

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel -- and even
~———“enjoys it!

AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1l is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa
~~~—and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.

.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/l's present operating context
joes not previde an adequate basis to evaluate these talents. It
is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these
areas, however.

t

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,
either personal or professional which inhibit his operational
use. The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset --
which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts
is a definite limitation on his employment.

CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his handler that he hopes
6 be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He
enjoys the work and presumably the financial security. However,

the combination of the security factors operative in this
case and the unlikelihood of Q/l's contirued eccess to targets
of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being
regarded as a career asset.

FIELD CASE OFFICER

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the
Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined Q/l's motivations for working

with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab
we can make at this enigmatic subject.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3

SUBJECT : Chicom Aspect of QRPHONE/1's
Operational Potential

1. ‘In continuing my efforts to probe operational
areas for the redirection of QRPHONE/1, I talked at

length on 3 January with his former case officer
ee received a very favorable H
‘Prognosis Fé; HE-QRPHONE/1's mobility (i.e. his tt
possible move to another European city or to Africa), H
his agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional 1

| training), and the prospects of making himself attractive
to the Chicoms (again preceded by appropriate training).

i 2, In_pursuit of the latter item I talked at length
today with the FE Division expert on a
long-range Chicom and CP penetration programs. I de- é
scribed in detail QRPHONE/1's background, current status,

1 and the variety of plans we have in mind and received

! reactions as follows:

| A. The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE
i has demonstrated thus far will never result in his & ‘
becoming of interest to either the Chicoms or the
Soviets for any operationally meaningful purpose.
While the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential
1 FI source, the Chicoms would not even do that.

B. Chicom officers abroad are still totally
obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic
and tactical application to a degree significantly - ;
more zealous than their Soviet counterparts.

Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets 4
the Chicoms discard persons of shallow substance as 7 q
far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned. 4
They are interested in only those who have a serious
intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and j
&@ serious revolutionary goal. The thousands of leftists tte
of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen h .
as only of marginal use to the Chicoms and certainly ‘ i

not the sort that they would take into their confidence. a

et
hee


. SECEET 2

C. To become of long-term operational use .
to us in the sense of exploiting his possible {
long-term use to the Chicoms, QRPHONE/1 should .
do two things: join an existing "acceptable"
organization such as the Trotskyite Party or a
black radical party and, at the same time begin i
a@ serious study of Marxist/Mavist doctrine. AS
he gets into this program (preceded by some ten
days training and close Headquarters direction)
he should begin. to seek out Communist intellectuals,
party members, leaders of radical groups, etc., to
ask questions about the dialectic, seek additional e t
guidance, borrow books and so forth. In doing this i
be will in time come into the attention of the
professional spotters the Chicoms have and begin to ‘ j

develop the sort of bona fides that the Chicoms, ae

in time, will find appealing. He should also in
this period seek out Chicom officials with the

game requests for help. The key here is to
demonstrate not that QRPHONE/1 is simply sympathetic,
with Maoism or any other Communist shading bu ja
he is a dedicated serious revolutionary.

D. A quicker way to come into the Chicom spot-
light might be for QRPHONE/1 to join the Black
Panthers, the SDS or one of the other radical groups
with which the Chicoms are already known to be in
touch. He will obviously have to sweat out a period
of probation in joining any such group until he
divests himself of his tattered ftist reputation t
and those JKLANCE accusations. feels that a 5
successful passing of this baptismal period will
depend solely on QRPHONE/1's willingness to plunge
wholeheartedly into a serious study of the terribly
boring and lengthy volumes of the dialectic. As he
demonstrates his capability to move more deeply into
this field to the satisfaction of the "spotters" he
will be accordingly provided additional help and
encouragement by Chicom contacts and officials.

E. The Chicoms will be looking at him as a
possible asset in their long-range targetting of the
American revolution, henge QRPHONE/1's utterances
ought to be couched in terms of his ultimate aim of
contributing to and participating in the American
revolution. In other words the Chicoms would see
little or no use

urope or Africa

F | felt that shold we pursue the above
&s a long-term operational goal for QRPHONE/1, the
city in which this takes place is almost irrelevant.
He could do it perhaps as well in an African setting
as in Europe and his cover status i.e., with
LPWEAKLY, really makes no difference because the
Chicoms would test the fibeif min himself and would
not ve deterred by his external trappings.

3. In answer to my question, he would be
happy to meet with QRPHONE to assess his potential in this
area and then, assuming we all decided to go ahead with
such redirection, kould train him and guide him
thoroughly enough to get him well on the track by spending
some seven to ten days with him on a concentrated program.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff

SUBJECT: QRPHONE

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Same Subject,
Dated 29 November 1971

-1, What follows below are some initial comments of mine on

the referent memorandum, per your request. We really feel in
Branch 3 that for a variety of reasons, we need more time to

’ deliberate on QRPHONE's future operational activity than the
previous two weeks, Partly this is due to extended absence by the
case officer in charge who has been plagued with a recurring
ilness--I believe you are familiar with this, It is also in part
attributable to the Section Chief's being new to the position and i
having his tlme absorbed by matters of current priority. So if you
don't mind, we should like to address ourselves further to this
subject following the Christmas holidays, At that time we should
Uke to Initlate some meetings on this matter both with yourself

components Inclading representatives from

2. Background: Your memo, of course, was triggered by
an earller one of mine which proposed that CRPHONE become
operationally engaged In attempting to establish a black Communist
cell The purpose of this would be twofold--
namely, to exacerbate relations thereby between the Soviet Union
and mainland China through various low-key covert action undertakings,
and in the process to further enhance QRPHONE's own credentials
as a Maolst activist. This tentative assignment, it should be noted,
arose because Branch 3 personnel had become increasingly aware of
the possibility that ORPHONE's project status might be terminated ac
in the not too distant future, While it is true that in the immediate ces
preceding month or 80, we have benefited from his intelligence i
Feporting, It ls all too clear that over the past two years, he has i
been of diminishing utility to CA Staff and other a:
discussing his future with his recent case officer]
her recommendation was that unless something could be found for him .
in the near future, we should give serious consideration to terminating

hs SEGRET

eas rennet nn Nn natn ements emt win nme



7 on SEZ. ul

his services during the coming year. Thus my foregoing proposal
arose from a desire on my part not to terminate an asset of proved
capabilities without giving the agent in question suitable opportunity
to become useful once more.

3. Ci Type Review/ORPHONE Personal Security: Your memo

makes out there have been frequent security reviews of CRPHONE's
security status, and you question the efficacy of our doing still one
more. On this let me point out that in making such a security a:
ment, we would be doing so in response to a current request by the
area division concerned whose cooperation we need to direct this
agent. One hardly needs streen that such a request probably should
‘be honored In the Interests of maintaining good relations even Lf its
fulfillment means redundant work, But apart from this, the case
officer also informs me that the case file does not contain any general
summary of the alleged security breaches involving QRPHONE and
their implications vis-a-vis his activities. It is true however that his
security etatus has been reviewed for each annual project review and
that assessments of his security status were made following each
‘\-alleged breach, but no up-to-date summary exists. As for our own
gut feelings on his personal vecurity, one hazards that he Is still in
pretty good shape. I agree with you that many of the past charges
leveled against him are of the same ilk 2s those leveled against other
leftist colleagues(who do not have any Agency association) by their
rivals. Aad for the structure of his case officer relationship--
that Is, having him handled by a deep cover officer from an adjacent
country--this would appear to be secure in the extreme (s0 much
80 that one would advocate that it be dropped due its operational
Inefficiency.)

4. Location: We tentatively agree that In all likeliho
should not be the venue for our proposed operational undertaking due

If not rhaps you or EUR Division might su; another
locale, yr the question as to whether or not the| tation would

kind of relationship with mainland China representatives, the station

5. Substance: You noted that ORPHONE.. . "cannot just
simply show up and start a leftist nuclel. . ."" Why not? Others
have, He is a well-known leftist in intellectual circles in Europe
and has written many articles in praise of Mao. This should do
for a start, As for what he might have to offer local leftists . .
money, energy and ideas will do. A great deal of money. of course,
is unneeded, but some is. We can supply It. As for ideas and
energy, he has both. Concerning the "bullt-in jealousy, animosity,
ete." which such action would likely engender on the part of local
rival leftists, this may or may not occur. But Is this such a calamity
Uf It should oceur? Are not leftists usually fighting among themselves
anyway? In any case, we have nothing to lose by trying to salvage
this agent, What we have to lose by not trying is an agent asset of
proved worth,

6. Credentials: You say in effect that QRPHONE has not
been known as an activist but only as an intellectual, (Frankly, the
dietinction is not very important in my mind.) Be that as it may, he
has written many articles on leftist subjects and has talked to
innumerable leftists around Europe over the years. True, he has
not been Involved in such actions as street demonstrations, but we
would not like him to be so personally involved in the future in any
case, What we would want him to do 1s to write pamphlets, informally
recralt associates to his group and provide a little money to the group
as might be required for various undertakings, Aside from the
organizing and funding, actually this is not very different from what
he has been doing--except that it will be in one place for a change.

that shopping him around to European stations Isa

my lead from C/EUR/CA who made a request along these lines,

‘willing at come future time to visit various field stations and to
attempt selling CRPHONE's services personally, we would be happy
to have him do #0. We, of course, don't know when he will be

8. Concluding Comment: I really feel that we should relate

kind of undertaking which we have proposed for QRPHONE, It may

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3 :
SUBJECT: Operational Redirection of QRPHONE/1 ;

1. In response to your request that I examine the
QRPHONE/1 project to determine how it might best be i
redirected in order to gain greater value for the time and i
money involved, I have talked at some length with appro- i
priate officers in CI/SO and Africa Division. I have been Hf
advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/1's dwindling :
productivity are as follows:

A. Key centers of activity of the radical left
in Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm. For
different reasons QRPHONE/1's access in these t
capitals is either circumscribed or off target.

His reputation among/target
groups of interest to us| has
been so tarnished that hé has not7—taken into their
confidence significantly enough to be of value.

.B. Although he has a multitude of contacts among
the left, virtually all are shallow, periodic, and then
very brief when they do occur. Even his correspondence
to the wore important radical leaders, which used to be
quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing.

been unable to develop a close and continuing personal
relationship with any one of them in order to develop
the intimate confidence so necessary for operational
exploitation.

i
i
i

D. His cover has always been thin and thus has
circumstantially at least lent credence to the periodic
allegations of his being a JKLANCE agent.

Cc. Because his contacts are so cursory, he has

ro



a. oO |

{
!

E. Close case officer direction has been made i
very difficult. because of the echelons existing i i
between QRPHONE/1 and LCPIPIT, coupled with relative i |

infrequency of field case officer meetings.

F. What contacts he has within the African
target, for example, are rendered virtually useless
because his case officers are unfamiliar on ¢ timely
basis with Africa Division requirements and also
miss valuable operational leads simply because they
do not recognize them. (This is no fault of the
ease officers because they obviously have little
opportunity to keep abreast of such requirements.)

i : G. The somewhat artificial nature of his trying }
to portray & pro-Mao stance may help him a bit with 4 j
targets similarly inclined but renders him ineffective i
with other political shadings among the left. 7 {

2. With all of the above in mind and without belaboring ‘
the history of this project, the following recommendation is '
offered and has been concurred in informally by CI/SO and :
-Africa Division officers with whom I have talked. }

A. Accepting the fact that QRPHONE/1's operational
utility in Europe is minimal, I propose LCPIPIT be {
directed to begin making arrangements for his transfer
H PCS to Africa and, hence, his operational control
. transferred to Africa Division as soon as feasible.

H B. From the point of view of MHCHAOS requirements ae
and Africa Division's own requirements, both elements te
Felt QRPHONE/1 could best be exploited :

It is one of the two most active cities in Africa for
the radical left, it is a hot-bed of both Soviet and
Chicom shenanigans, and it is politically vital to
East African stability.

C. However, because of. 's well-known
association with two exiled )pposition
politicians and current reports that these

D. Both to give QRPHONE/1 time to cleanse his
tattered image and because there are almost as
important operational tasks in West Africa, the idea
is to move him (1) jor (2) for
perhaps a year. This is to done in concert with a
suitable strengthesing of his cover (i.e. two or i
three more stringerships) and a concurrent mutation
of his political posture to that of a plain old
anti-imperialist rather than the more confining Ee
pro-Mao stance. He would be run directly

24 November 1971
MEMORANDUM OF MEETING
SUBJECT: QRPHONE Operations in Europe

1. EUR/CA, and myself briefly
discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 November.
During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal
which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at
LCPIPIT in mid-October. In substance, this proposal was
that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through
Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either

for an extended period of time. In either of
these locations he would then attempt to identify and
to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting contacts
in the left sector of the student and youth population,
who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study
group. QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so
inasmuch as he is an established writer of the Maoist
stripe. His relationship with these contacts or followers
would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational con-
text. Rather, he would guide and motivate such contacts
as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist
group, and would claim to have been a member of a larger

such group He would, of course, imply
to his fol) ers attempting to develop a
similar nucleus in ——— PF whenever, as
good Communists sholTd>

2.. Operational activity would be of a twofold nature.
First, exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists
would follow along lines of a typical black Communist

poettsanlatiog the kind of notional movement which
leveloped in the Middle East some seven or
eight years ago. Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in
turn, would each recruit two or three other sympathizers
who over time could distribute anti-Soviet literature and
perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the
Station, and which could be attributed to the PRC.
Presumably their actions would result in some local
embarrassment to the USSR and the PCI. Second, QRPHONE,

himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials-—
jalready strong--to the point where he might well become

‘4. The charge is made that QRPHONE is too thinly
Spread and there is a recurring urge that his targetting
be better focussed. Can he in fact be better focussed
on a multi-divisional basis or would focussing, in
practice,result in his being narrowed down to a primarily -.

divisional target?

5. Granting that the CIA label is somewhat in-
discriminately used for character assassination in the
conspiratorial fringe in which QRPIHONE has been operating,
isn't he in fact stuck with this label and in view of
the international character of this conspiratorial
fringe, won't it turn up wherever he gocs?
is there really much chance he will be given any signifi-
cant information (and not deception information) by anyone
who will do s0 because he wants the information passed

to CIA?

6. When he was looked into in April 1968 by a
Chicom official, what do we suppose to be meant by the
officials finding that it was not clear if he was
completely reliable in a Marxist-Lenist sense?

7. How eagerly sought-after are travelers to China’
now-a-days? What is the forecast as to demand for such

travelers by next summer?

8. With a reportedly anti-US,
and children, how really mobile is QRPHONE in a
PCS Sense? If we should move QRPHONE and family to a new
location for a trial period and it didn't work out,
wouldn't resettling him have considerable complications? |

9. In how many languages does QRPHONE have verbal

and written fluency?

10, What are the current clearance limitations upon)

our use of QRPHONE?

11, One gathers from the project renewals that

authorities. Does anyone doubt that in view of the
groups and individuals he contacts on his travels he
has a dossier in each of these countries? Does anyone

doubt that in many of these dossiers the alleged CIA
connection is recorded? In view of this, isn't it a fact
that probably the safest place for him to be contacted
in spite of whatever tradecraft he and

may practice? In spite of a rapport and back- ,
ground knowledge clencnts which he undoubtedly benefits ,
from with| are these factors worth the extra
handling complications? Doesn't this handling method
essentially double the cost of the operation?

12, What were the reasons _for the break with "Fair |
Play for Cuba?" the break with Does QRPHONE |
have a power base at all among American negroes (SNCC i
doesn't like him and it is recorded in the renewals that
blacks and revolutionaries sense that he is not "sincere")?

13. Can't we determine right adquarters
| the degree of interest in having
i a rather low-level 2 Sn la operation involving anti-
Soviet propaganda ostensibly emanating from pro-Chicom
sources? Now that the PRC has decided to go "legit,"
what is our best estimate as to the likelihood that they

will lose interest in previous and current pro-Chicom ~
fringe groups?

14. Other than on the above, if we asked QRPHONE
, to become involved in depth with one of the groups he
is in touch with, wouldn't he have to act "more Royalist
than the King,” and wouldn't he be the first to come
under suspicion in case action against the group acetate
to a leak?

15. If he could not take covert action himself
potentially likely to become involved with covert
action by other groups against: ~

16. What are QRPEONE'’s real talents? Why hasn't
he been able to do more about establishing himself on
a more self-s:staining basis? Is it because of the
targets we kecp pushing him on? What is meant by these :
allusions to QRPHONE's "work discipline?" Do his talents fe
possibly point toward some covert action use in a role
where the CIA label is relatively less important?

It should be noted for the record that aS not given

As to QRPHONE/1, SMOVID on 15 June 1970 followed up his March

4970 laints to JADWIN about QRPHONE/ 1° contacts with expstriates

SHOVID expressed concern about QRPHONE/1's security
ts view that QRPHONE/1's information was of iarginal value. SNOVID
euphasizing that he was expressing -@ view personally endorsed by
SMUPSILON, outlined three possible options: withdraw QFPIONL/1 from
the country; stop running and tasking QKPHONE/1 as an agent; or have
take over the running of QKPHONE/1. (:JRPHONE/1 subsequently was
ins tracted to stop pursuing his SMORANGE targets.)

AGENT EVALUATION
NAME: QRPHONE/1 DATE: 18 January 1971
PROJECT: QRPHONE STATUS: Contract Agent (Under
isrsae a@ Mencrardum cf Ore).
Agreement)

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
neluding Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/l's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and |
without posing problems for his handler. His personality is
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not

ys totally successful -- leaving us with tantalizing bits

of information and many unanswered questions -~ this is generally

due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable

to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
as a journalist. fe has acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself
has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
‘under Motivation.) 7 E

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/1's attitude is good. He has made
an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasm.

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on
which a good dea las beensaid over the course of this operation.
The following points can be made on the subject of Q/l's
motivation: : .

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

; - SECRET



B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional
organization has been enhanced in Q/l's case by the ~
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handling. Indecd. Q/1 has probably come
to hold a rather glamorous “storybook” image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be.
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti-
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to -
accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of
a very impressive outfit.

Cc. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1
has become active in at least two "causes", In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as “squealing” on his friends -- indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid

him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to

be independent of his wife's family's charity.

¥, Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/l

-elearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international

issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life. which
he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these
several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.

i ee
t mares ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: “ ei's wife is not witting of his

a. ation. je was allowed to believe that he was
Shari indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware
of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at
i Q/1, but as iar as Wl can determine (and this is not a subject
on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she i
continues to accept the Chinese story . It ‘should be added . i
that Mrs. Q/1 is the holder of some rather
typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should also be noted
that the relationship between the two is. fraught with a variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation,
Certainly the whole subject. of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed --
lest it lead to. acrimony. Mention should also be made that t
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Q/1's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.

| RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/l.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism -- prov.ded it is constructive. i
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness :
eccasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls Hite
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
m this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
press for all the desired detuils.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has

“signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/1 is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1 has a good sense of personal security and his
mdler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/1's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.
: . 3

& tw Ve

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past ‘allegations of Q/l's
affiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment,
add an extra dimension to Q/l's cover situation. We have no
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof,
nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of.
contacts. :

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can
work we. ‘or extended periods without supervision.

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative
urden. fe is not overly concerned about his administrative
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely
expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the
rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,
he can be very upset.

REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective
reporter -- both in terms of ability to elicit and writing
style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue
his efforts on a Sustained basis. :

LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French,
“—“~~Ytalian and German.

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel -- and even
enjoys itt

AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1 is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa
‘and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/1's present operating context
joes not provide an adequate basis to evaluate these talents. It
is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these
areas, however.

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,
either personal or professional which inhibit his operational
use. The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset --
which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts
is a definite limitation on his employment.

». CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his. handler that he hopes
0 be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He
enjoys the work and presumably the financial security. However,

———regrneeene ae

i



|
|
|

the combination of the security factors operative in thia
case and the unlikelihood of Q/l's continuéd access to targets
of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being
regarded as a career asset.

FIELD CASE OFFICER

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the
Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined Q/1's motivations for working
with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab
we can make at this enigmatic subject.

and by the end of the first session wes obviously enjoying it end
appreciating the opportunity to learn to write our way. He pointed

information in his head for two or three weeks, then put it all dom |—
the night before he reets his Case Officer. Fron his conversetion, /
it eppeered that orgenizing a report had never occurred to hin before,

reports on two people. He was rortified when he care in on the last

evaluece te performance in each area of tradecraft in which training wes

SUBJECT: Request for ORPHONE/I Salary Increase

REFERENCE: OEPA - 2122

1, The following is a breakdown of QRPHONE/I's ealary history:

Starting salary, June 1965 $600 per month
1 September 1966 $700 per month :
1 July 1967 $800 per month “

All of the above figures are tax free, In addition, as of 1 May 1969, Subject
wae given an additional $50 per month (also tax free) as our contribution
teward some form of insurance againet the future (endowment, lump sum

. cash value, or whatever the Field and he finally selected). Thie appears on

the books as a salary Increase, However, although to his ultimate advantage,
It doea result in a small decrease in take-home pay since 0/1 le also required
to make s contribution to the payment of the premium.

2. In addition, Q/1's MOC also provides for $10, 000 indemnification in
case of death, or paymant of $600 per month up to $10, 000 to his wife In case
of his total incapacitation or disappearance while employed by CIA, Allowance
had originally been made for this provision when he seemed to have an excellent
chance for travell this year we included the provision as a general
benefit, not tied to any particular type of hazardous travel alone, Finally,
thie year's amendment to his MOC also included a severance bonus of one
month's salary for each year of satisfactory service. We placed $3,200 ina
special escrow account to cover his previous four years’ service, and are
providing in our Project renewals for each year's required deposit to that
escrow account. Please note, however, that this benefit has at rat been, et neal
surfaced either to ORPHONE/I or to by decision ee)
decision which I believe wae wise).

3. It is my feeling that the proposed salary lncrease of $250 tax free
per month le way out of line. I belleve that paragraph 3 of the reference,

lis a rather specious and unrealistic

argamest. Q/l, although an American, is an agent, and nothing more, TT

to some of the criticisms that have been leveled at his production, the fact
remains that I h-ve not seen any marked improvement during the past two

yeara In the quality of the material he provides us. As time goes on and ot
the realistic criteria of what le disseminable and what Is not are applied i
more and more to his production, and this production in turn remains at ita
present level of superficiality, we will see less and less of It qualify for
dissemination. Since he Is an FI agent, this has considerable significance,
although It of course does not present the full picture of hie capabilities. His
operational intelligence has been received with mixed evaluations; usually

his initial coverage of a subject Is very well received and often whets the
appetite of the recipient for more; somehow, however, that "more" never
seems to materialize -- they get more of exactly the same caliber, but

little more in terms of depth of reporting. Perhaps the fault lies in QRPHONE/I,
in which case we should realize early that what we have here is not a true

Fi agent, but rt of “operational intelligence butterfly." Perhaps, on the
other hand, the fault lles in ndling of the man, not in terms of
the personal relationship which has been able to bulld up with him,

but maybe even becauce of that relationship. 1 remember when I first talked
wit IT quickly realized that he felt he knew more than Headquarters
was

as to what rtant for Q/1 to cover and what was not; Iam sorry I i :
missed| on his TDY here and when I was| } and that his

home a) ‘a been postponed, for I had hoped to determine for myself

whether stili felt that way. Whatever the reason, I am by no means o

giving up on O/T, but will continue to try to narrow down his targets so that
he will have a falr shake at showing what he can do when he is act allowed to
cover the waterfront,

4, What the above paragraph is leading up to, Is that I do not in all
honesty feel that he has done anything to really deserve a promotion, except
Dalld longevity since the last one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that
newspaper job offered to him (hls preference, in any event), However, Ido
fealize that a man muet have an Incentive, and would like to propose that we
suggest to| [hat a more realistic increase might be in the neighborhood
of $100 a month, and that the (eee mentioned in paragraph 2 above

might new be surfaced both to! and to Q/l as a new benefit,

report for 1 April to 30 June 1969; this Is the last one we have received.

“QRPHONE/1, including discussions of his participation in the new magazino.

“ ESTIMATZ O? AGENT'S CONTINUED DEGREE OF ACCESS TO TARGETS: QRPHONE/1's

cations of this overature on his RVROCK status. See jand
DIRECTOR 28728 for details. : :

Through two unwitting female informants QRPHONE/1 was able to obtain re-
porting on the Algiers Cultural Festival. See OELA - 51298.

QRPHOME/1 has continued his mo) ing of the activity of various African
liberation movement figures

SPECIFIC MATTERS OF OpZRATIONAL SECURITY AND COVER: QRPHONE/1's vacation

with his family produced a marked impcovement in his domestic

situation ~ with its consequent impact upon the cover and security of the
entire operation. ‘This remains a matter of concern and one which will be
carefully monitored. : 5 ese

ORPURE is now entering into a more meaningful overt coruecpondodes with |

This will have a positive impact upon QRPHONE/1's cover as a “representative
of QRPURE. a Sees
A new means of funding ORPHONE/1* s salary is being sought to replace BIKNEE,
which is no longer functioning due to unrelated problema encountered by the &:
principal agent of that Operation. For a review of the security implications
of this matter (which are thought to be mjnimal) please see DIRECTOR 46178. j-

access tO His Various targets remains substantially unchanged.

EXTENT TO WHICH AGENT FAS BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE ASSIGNMENTS, INCLUDING
INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION: OQRPHONZ/1 has approached all his assignments with
enthusiasm and energy. He has fulfilled these assignments to the maximum



a

ve
et

degree feasible ~ given his cover and the unwitting informant-type nature
of his relationship with his many contacts. QRPHONE/1 makes every effort.
to overcome this limitation and in this regard a plentiful supply.of' back-
ground information greatly facilitates his elicitation of added details
from his informants. However, this limitation is one which will always
be with us in the case of QRPHONE/1 and it is one which can sometimes be
particularly frustrating. During the past quarter QRPHONE/1 has been the
source of 11 intelligence reports prepared|

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS LEVIED UPON AGENT FOR ENSUING PERIOD: QRPHONE/L
will make a trip in late September und early October in order to
survey the situation within the Italian new left/radical sector. ‘This
trip is one which has been requested by| tation. (The trip will have
been completed by the time thir report is received by licadquarters.)

QRPHONE/1's contact with an official of the Eritrean Liberation Pront lea
to a TDY by AP Division officer to brief jon
the ELP and to discuss possibla i ion of this contact.

QRPHONE/1's trip to the United States has beon deferred until spring 1970
by which time any possible repercussions from QRPEONY‘s return will be
relatively unlikely.

An effort will be made to explore the operational possibilities posed by
QORPHONE/1's existing (or potential) contacts within the Arab liberation
movements. Headquarters views on this matter were requested in OEPA-2044.

"A ve-scheduling of ORPHONE/1‘s ae been proposed and
Hea@quarters and| ave been ask fox guidance/requirements.

Eas

AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO ASSIG:MENTS LEVIED INCLUDING MOTIVATION,
QRPHONE/1‘s response to assignuents, like hie

ies to be enthusiastic and energetic. The comments
made in previous quarte; ng _xeqarding his security and motivation
xemain valid insofar as| and| jare able to judge.

AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO CAS3 O7PICER HANDLING OR CRITIQUE OF HIS
REPORTING TECHNIQUE: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant personality and re-
lates easily to others. This is a positive factor in his elicitation of
information from his many contacts and also makes dealing with him a
pleasant and uncomplicated experience. QRPHONE/1 accepts case officer
handling - including direction and criticism - well and in a constructive
vein. The same holds true of critique of his reporting. Please see pre-
vious reporting on this subject for added details. .

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, INCLUDING PROMOTIONS, TRAINING: A new means of
funding QRPHONE/1's salary is now being devised. This has béen the subject

of several items of correspondes between Hei arters and| We
plan to consult with thel xepresentative nm this mat :
QRPHONE/1 has had some purely overt problems with his nk (an

apparent error in his statement, etc.) He is also being charged very high
service charges for the performance of routine transfers. If he is not’
able to resolve his problems with this bank it may be necessary for him
to change banks.

At insistance QRPHONE/1 has begun to invest a portion of his
monthly salary in a reputable Mutual Pund of his choice. ‘This modest
investment program will enhance his financial security in the event of
termination and/or a xainy day“. -

there was no contact with however, we felt
it might be possible that could add to our understanding

of this p velopment from sources available to their

PROCESSING ACTION.

ef,
Chief of Statio:
Chief of Stat
Chief of Bas:

2. As addressees are aware QRPHONE/1 has officially been
denied entry into Switzerland since 16 December 1963. This order
was issued in connection with his employment with Identity A,
which was then receiving money from the Chinese--in violation of
Swiss neutrality. A similar order was also issued at that time
for Identity B, who was the Editor of Identity A.

2. It is now some six years later and QRPHONE/1 (at least
overtly) is employed as a legitimate journalist. He is not a
member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss authorities--
although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of
leftist individuals in pur-uit of his operational tasks. OQRPHONE/1
has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland-~
in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that
if the Swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should
also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland. QRPHONE/1
obviously feels personally about this, and it may be that future
operational benefit could be gained if QRPHONE/1 were again able
to enter Switzerland.

i
{
i

3. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a report

written by QRPHONE/1 following his contact with the Swiss Embassy

Jon this matter. We are also forwarding under separate

cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he
formally states his request that the entry ban be lifted.

“CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

4. You will note that the Swiss Embassy suggested that
QRPHONE/1 work through the U.S. Embassy on this matter. We have
told QRPHONE/1 not to do this, but rather to deal directly with
the Swiss. If he needs certification of his status as a working
journalist we suggested that QRPHONE/1 obtain this from the appro-
peicte professions] organization {of which he is a member) in
London.

5. We presume that the Swiss Embassy will be
forwarding QRPHONE/1's letter to Bern. We will appreciate being
advised of any Swiss action, or statements, on this case which

may come to the attention of Station. Any advice which

Station can offer regarding QRPHONE/1's pursuit of this matter
will be welcome.

6. Of course{__ Station should continue to be guided by
the contents of DIRECTOR-69543 in any dealings with the Swiss
concerning QRPHONE/1.

Chief of Station, :

1. On 12 March 1969 QRPHONE/1 was granted an extension on his
alia until 15 February 1970.

2. Since QRPHONE/1's file indicates an
interest on the part of| jin his case, was consulted
prior to the issuance of the extension. (This is not unusual in
the cases of persons such as QRPHONE/1 and does not necessarily
imply an “agent" status. Of course Wi is not mentioned at all
in this file.) In coordination with Station it was decidea
that a re-newal of QRPHONE/1's one-yéar visa was preferable to the
granting of permanent resident status--which would normally have
been the case. We quote from the appropriate memorandum fron
to[____]Station on this matter:

“the choice was between:-

a) an extension of two months

b) an extension of one year i.e. a repeat of what
was granted to him last year i

c) that his temporary residence should be made :
"unconditional" which would be the normal
procedure if there were no special considerations.

Our feeling was that for QRPHONE/1's cover purposes (c)
a would be undesirable; if his friends got to know of it

they might think he was being treated over-generously in

view of his contacts with leftwing revolutionaries such

exder to inarcase ite effectiveness it vegan to publish a mcathly edition,
"African Revolution", consisting lerge.y of saterial selected froa previous

Deoans increasingly arparent that the publicetica was lending its suppart
to the Marxist-Leninist theory of revolution, scd the Chinese Communist
ipterpretation of it. The princizal article tn issue Yo. 7 (Hoveaber, 1963)
which bad the ancdyne titie "Third World? Which Third World?", was largely
gn exposition of tke Chinese Cocmunist attituce towards the national
Liberation movement, draving saterial end ineziration from the Chinese
Coamuniet Party's docunant "A proposal concerning the general line of the
Taternational Coominiet Movement". (This wae the lotter, dated 14th June
1963, from the Contre] Comittes of the Cainscs Communist Party to the

Gontral Comittes of the Conmntet Party of ti Soviet Unions it is & major
document in the ideclogical dispute between the two parties.) The article
contained the following quotation from the Czinese letters
