of both LCPIPIT and

operational potential of QRPRONB/1.

3.

TDY at Headquarters re discussed the

necessity of having QRPHONE/l undergo an intersire seven day

STRIKILAl training program to be conducted

our opinion that in order for this training to be of maxinum

benefit, QRPBONE/1

ought to be ensconced in a

safehouse facility which provides security, comfort and an

atnosphere conducive to learning.

It is laportant that the

training be couducted in a locale which will allow QRPHONE to give

his full attention eithout being disturbed by his multitude of

business and social contacts.

Therefore, re recousen that LCPIPIT

rent a cottago or beach house away fron

Nfor the duration of

the training cycle.

In discussing this with QRINONE, he readily

agreed and indicated that there would be no difficulty in gotting

away from his fanily for as long as ve thought necessary.

no I could put it clearly in perspective as it related to

I"ll not bother with

as both pleased and relleved at the reception he got fron

ORPHONE/1 his Impressions of 1t all, his reaction to the

STILINILAM proposal, and whether he

would accept its

demanding obligations.

ORPHONE said he certainly would

and that he found it a real challenge to his intellect and

his operational skills.

The tedious rudy of the dialectie

would not deter him.

His only concern

"as bow he should

actually play 1t as

he developed relationships with

appropriate party members and,

ultinately, the Chinese in

SMORANGE. I pointed out he needn't concern himseld with

the inst point because that would be part of the purpose

of the ten-day training program in SHORANGE In September

which would be given him by the Headquarters STFLIUFLAH

officer.

I sald the training would require total enersion

for ten days straight, probably in some secluded beach

house on the coast where all involved could reside full

t1me.

He said this would present no problen cover-vise;

he rould siuply tell his family he had done to the continent.

I said that

would be working out the details of

Ihis with him, probably after his return from vacation.

I sald that given ORPHONE/l's past performance,

his credentials with the radical left, and his apparent

Interest in vigorously pursuing the STFLIMFLAN program ve

expected to be able to measure in six to eight monthe the

likellhood of his being able to achieve all the STFLIMELAM

objectives based upon the progress he would have made by

then sith bis

contacts.

Should it appear that the

STrI Lal operation would not succeed ve would be discusing

alternative courses of action with him by the end of the

year. He did say that of all the countries in Europe wbere

his STFLIMPLAM and radical left potential is probably the

best, Italy would be first and Denmark second.

5. I told QEPHONE/l that bis meoting with

• had been moved to 31 July as he requested, reviewed bis

European vacation plans and his Malta trip and wished bim

the very beat of luck.

At thia point QRPHONE/1 certainly

seems w1lling and able aggressively to pursue our operational

plans. We shall see.

WOGEAR Review of African Liberation Movements

In general, the author has done a reasonably good job

describing the ¿istorical development of the various African

liberation movements, especially when one considers the con-

plexity and number of splits and mergers that have occurred

within and among the movements over the years.

There are

several glaring inaccuracies, however,

in the author's con

crusions about the current position and effectiveness of the

several Portuguese African liberation movements.

Regarding Angola, the author characterizes the siPhA as an

Ideologically-oriented group (1.e.,

Soviet doctrine) that has

lalled to grasp and utilize to its

advantage the tribal realitles

that exist in Angola.

The author fails to acknowledge, horever,

that the MPLA has had some success,

albeit limited, in building

& movement that is national and multiracial in character rather

than tribally oriented.

Despite its urban intellectual leader-

ship, the MPLA has had some success winning local support in

rural eastern Angola.

• By contrast, GRAE ranks a poor second.

From inception,

Its primary base of support has been the large

Angolan refugee

population of Bakongo

tribesmen who live in southwestern zaire.

Although the organization has won some support among Bakongo

kinsmen across the border in northwestern Angola,

it has failed

to broaden its base because of its thinly disguised regional

and tribal nake-up.

Moreover,

Roberto's unwillingness to

delegate authority

or compronise have produced chronic disputes

at the leadership level.

The author's conclusion that GRAE 1s

• formidable force to be reckoned with in the future of Angola

is contradicted by the fact that the MPLA is by far the

largest and

most effective of the

three nationalist groups

opposing the Portuguese in Angola.

MOZANBIQUE

The present FRELIMO leadership does not appear to be in the

state of disarray in 1972 that the author believes it is.

Although some differences undoubtedly persist, the present

leaders seem to have closed ranks somewhat since the departure

of Simango in late 1969.

For the present, any internal squabbles

that may exist are not noticeably affecting FRELIMO's fighting

abilities inside Mozambique.

Also connected with this process. is

the

gradual development of a different "outlook."

It is usually a

mixture of idealism

and Marxism-Leninism-socialism-Mao Tse-tung

thought. Usually unstructured but developing.

another without any particular approbation being attached for

This can tase one into

different areas, anarchism, GW advocacy, revolutionary nihilism,

socialism, Marxist-Lenism, etc. However, to get to latter

It must be done logically.

2.

Tightly Structured Op: Emphasis upon tight, controlled

,contacts which

seek to accomplish a specific purpose-collection

of into not necessarily one nor always one.

Purpose is to lay

ground work for future developments.

Purpose to establish certain

contacts which can be later used in

either positive or negative

fashion.

Structured conversation is also essential.

It too

checkable.

Study:

Most important aspect in opening phases of op.

Without correct study and without development (understanding)

of "correct outlook" one will always be a dilettante to the,

conditions, " but not someone who is reliableidelosical tool,

Those to be exploited now and those to be

are developed are to be used as a means of building his

These

conversations will be later used when he

explains how and why and

when he became interested.

5.

Diffuse Nature of Op:

In beginning op has a diffuse

nature.

It is necessary to make many contacts.

Some will be

more useful than others, but all have potential for use in

one circumstance or another.

Since we have no way of knowing

how or from hon the Chinese collect their intelligence, seek

or otherwise spot budding revolutionaries we can assume

that some one of his acquaintances will report his interest

In Mao, etc.

We can assume that through some of his activities

Chinese will build up his dossier so that at a later date when

no so directly to the chinese for help they can look in their

dossier and see that & number of months ago, etc., various

things were reported. Etc.

6.

Ops as a Process of Development: Permit no diversions

or detours which might become permanent.

This would include

targets of opportunity, etc.

operational line and

line, must be cautious with this. Ops line serves as guide for

whole op from beginning to end.

as to insure torard development of op.

Tactics in Op: Must always be carefully thought out so

Sonething must be seen

emerging or useful, or having potential future value for develop

ment of op, otherwise it is pointless to undertake it.

Tactics

arc details. Details are most important aspect in day to day

running of op.

They must be paid attention to, must be contrib

utory,

must be carried out in correct sequence, and we must keep

In mind that at one or more points it is these details which will

be subject of the scrutiny of the opposition.

IT IS IMPORTANT

THAT THESE DETAILS APPEAR LOGICAL TO THIS OPPOSITION the sane as

may seem illogical to us at times. Our logic is not

Ops is Step by Step Process: Op should/or can be

divided into steps, phases,

Stages, segments,

whatever.

Each

chase should dovetail into

To some extent a general

outline can be developed Each of

the major phases should

be subdivided into stages so that they can be dealt with step

by step.

For example: Three broad categories:

exploit this interest.

After he has completed first phase

we will begin to make structured contacts with the Chinese.

In

these contacts he will show that he has a grasp of the ideology;

18 interested in learning more, desires to study more intensively.

Will use as negative examples:

his book, Panthers, some aspects

of Bergman's behavior, the unstructured and undisciplined nature

of most revolutionary

activists in U.S., particularly among the

blacks, or whatever may seem appropriate at time contact is

However, will seek their help to further his study and

made indicate recognition of need to return to u.S. in order

to undertake correct role in revolutionary struggle.

At this

stage we will have an idea of interest of Chinese.

We will be

able to determine whether we can expect progress or not.

If

they prove willing to help they will then be asked to guide

his

further study,

to help him.

Through this help

they will

be able to see the development

which has taken place.

We should

get a good feeling of their willingness to guide him after a

couple of meetings.

If we are shut out then must make ops

judgement from that point oncan always target against Soviets

and use Chinese

as negative example.

If they are interested

we will then lose some aspects of our initiative, but in'essence

the more Initiative we lose to them the more they try to

direct him,

the deeper he becomes involved with them, which is

our objective-one of them. He must continue his study.

3rd Phase:

Continue his study; continue his contacts all

around, but by now should have significant contacts and can

dispense with the more general "sparrow" approach. Once certain

of their willingness to help we ask about a trip to Peking

to study after which he wants to return to U.S. and take active

role.

Recognize that this may be a sticking point.

We don't

want him here.

However, this idea has to always be in the

far as the Chinese are concerned otherwise they

have little reason to be interested in him.

This MUST appear to

be his goal.

We may be able to circunvent it later for one

reason or another, or it might be useful to bring him back

temporarily.

This decision must be reserved for that time.

These stages and sub-stages must be further divided 1f

we are to understand the operation correctly and are to carry

1t out correctly.

Each action he is asked to undertake must

be seen leading to something concrete in the next or another

step.

The whole op goes STEP BY STEP.

We do not insert

unrealistic objectives, or those which would be desirable but

may be difficult.

This is a waste of time.

We only seek to

do what is possible-possible is what can be turned into reality.

Emphasis must be made on "step by step" approach and must

maintained.

Otherwise we can trip ourselves up by trying to

accomplish something which is out of sequence FOR THEM.

He has read Marx and Lonin.

We could then say that he will read Mao and

1. On 24 July 1972,

and the undersigned

converged on the OTR safesite in

him on his trip through WOCORK.

2.

The discussion was started by having QRPHONE

It should be noted here that several of the individuals

that QRPHONE was to have seen were out of town or

unavailable, however, QRPHONE will correspond with these

NEWARK

QRPHONE met with Leibel Bergman at bis home

and stayed overnight (14-15 July) as his guest.

QRPHONE told Bergman that he had decided to make

a full-time commitment to the study of Marxist

Leninist (ML) doctrine in order to become more

proficient in M-L theory and would like to join

the RU to

further this ambition.

Bergman's reaction,

according to QRPHONE, was enthusiastic.

gave QRPHONE some M-L literature (which was the

sane as the literaturel

Jgave him

Several

weeks ago to study) which he

felt would be helpful.

Bergman stated that if QRPHONE was really interested

in becoming involved in the M-L movement he should

return to WOCORK because that "was where all the

inconsistencies were." Bergman invited QRPHONE to

The

following are some general comments QRPHONE

provided about Bergman.

Bergman doesn't like

Newark, he has been mugged several times and

would like to go back to California; however,

that is not possible at this time, so Bergman

will instead move to New York City. Bergman

is pleased with the current development of the

RU.

He said that the recent trip to China by

BeVeral RU members was successful and that the

trip had been pleasant for them.

QR PHONE

commented that it appears that Bergman does not

have the same control of the RU that he formerly

had, although he is regarded as the "guru" of

the RU.

NEW YORK

ORPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting

to sell the English language rights of

Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA.

Ward had been trying to get Lyle Stuart to

purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy

toward Wilfred Burchett;

• "that old Communist"

according to Stuart, was too great.

Burchett

apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't

want to publish anything with his name on it.

ORPHONE,

in our presence, called Stuart and

convinced him to at least read the manuscript of

the book before he turned it down.

Ward has a

South Vietnamese student living with him as a

combination houseboy/companion.

This student,

whose name is David Truong,

is the son of the

South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong

Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 South Vietnames election

on a peace platform and who is now in prison..

ORPHONE said that this student has amassed a large

collection of books on intelligence, that the

books are expensive and that he doesn't have any

idea where the money to buy the books came from.

He also said he doesn't think Truong has

immigration. papers to stay in WOCORK legally. I

asked if Truong was in any way involved with the

recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE

stated that Truong knew the hijackers and might bave

known something about the attempted hijacking

because the hijackers had also stayed at Ward's

apartment.

vacation in Japan.

He did manage to see

FNU Boggs, who is apparen:ly no longer involved

with radical organizations but who is acting as a

clearinghouse for black and white radicals.

ORPHONE characterized Boggs as less doctrinaire

and less dogmatic than he had been in the past.

Boggs' feeling about the black radical movement

is that it is in considerable disarray.

CHICAGO

QRPHONE saw LPWEAKLY/l who told him that he.

was trying to get an invitation to visit China®

LPWEAKLY/1 told QRPHONE that if he went he would,

see about taking him along.

This was the first:

that QRPHONE knew about LPWEAKLY/l's plans.

He feels that the Mid-west is a part of the

country where the Government ought to test nuclear

warheads. QRPHONE also met with Earl and Lee Rose.

Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he

must have caused some embarrassment to the

delegation by his naivete. He attempted to meet

African revolutionaries, particularly members of

the MPLA, which he didn't realize were Moscow-

Rose asked QRPHONE to write and send

Completion of Training Report for ORPHOKB/1,

Training Program "SHAN"

1. QRPHOE/1 was trained covertly

from 22 June to

14 July 1972.

There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty seven

training hours.

This was a happy reunion of trainee and instructor. Less then

two years ago, PHONE was given three days of reports training (Please

see Completion of Training Report dated 19 October 1970).

Just as then,

PHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment

of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remembering that the

Instructor does not eat lunch, PHONE brought & sandwich with him daily

and took this lunch while Ilstening to the Instructer. Thus, every

minute of every day was made to count.

3.

The only time lost was three hours for

and on the

several phone calls he had to make daily to check for calls to his cover

office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his

office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls

took half an hour. On some days, they took far less.

His cover organization work took up a considerable portion,

everyday, of his free time with the result that he could not do any

casing to speak of for subseguent preperation of commo plans for exercises.

For example, told early on to prepare two dead drop commo plans, he

was not able to come up with anything till the last week . end then

Stunt!

On Tuesday, July 4th, his publisher appointed him baby sitter for the

publisher's teen age son and there went any hope of getting eny casing

done that day. At leest one time, he mentioned that he did not 8o

to bed till two that morning and as he had left the afternoon before,

se had stated that he had neetings starting at your thirty that afternoon.

With all that, he nevertheless was fully alert and attentive every minute

of every training session.

6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his

Instructor played the role of operations officer - and a real dumb-

dunb he was. In such circumstances, PHONE had to do all the thinking»

mll the planning, all the casing for neeting sites, all the analyzing,

all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment.

It was pure joy

to watch this man, aiter each meeting and again before the next one,

go to work on the problem. He knew where he was, knew where he wanted

to go, knew how to get there.

during the critique

at the end of the series of exercises said: "He did a beautiful job,"

PHONE had earned that accolade all by himself. The instructor's only

contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition.

?. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a Low bow in

the direction of

He played his sgent role excellently well

and made the exercise a meaningful one for PHoNE.

The three trips to

must have been very taxing, particularly in view

of his immediately upcoming IDY trip, but they were efforts well spent.

8. No man, of course, is perfect.

Each has an Achilles heel, &

weakness, or an all-too-hunan trait, at the very least. Our PHONE has

his. He has & very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing It, he reljes

on It, counts on 1t.

This, In turn, leads to a small fallure in seli-

discipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment

pitch, he cane in with six words (maybe not that many) scratched on a

3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook.

He then proceeded, from

these few words, to run off his plan without a single pause for en

uh, hi, er, etc.

It was as though he was reading a definition from a

dictionary, so smoothly did his mind and thoughts run. He prepares

everything ip.his mind, it appears, and does not like to write out

that which he feels he should not have to write out.

to heve so facile a mind, a bit of discipline, to write out in full

so important an act es a recuritment pitch, might one day save griel

when an error would have been spotted had the entire plan been written

out then looked over for possible flews.

9. This small flaw, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable

measure for FoR's failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till

PHONE felt he could just as easily report

In fact, the other dead drop (he had been asked to do two)

on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the paper was ir

front of him and he was reading fron it. Nothing was missing - area

escription, access, hours of availability, the opposition, pros an

cons as to suitabllity - it was all there. He just didn't like tr

wite out that upon which he could report orally.

10. In writing reports on the two counter-surreillance exercises,

he dashed those off in jig tine. No pause for thining, no pause to

analysis before and alter each neeting - no pause to think, to review,

to reconstruct, to remenber - just an IBM-type printout.

Il. The instructor sets don this reluctance on our hero's part

to write out certain things, not to downgrade him, but to alert desk

and field officers that if they must have a certeir report by a certain.

time, and they want it in writing, they must be firm.

for example,

after the second meeting in the developmental series, the instructor

said: "I must have that report first thing in the morning. Do you

vant to take tine out from this afternoon's training session to do It?"

And, as already reported above, PHONE preferred to save the training

time and he answered

"I will make time to write it". In this case,

time was of the essence becausel

had to see the report before

To sum up this item: When PHOTS feels that an oral

report is adequate he finds it a little difficult to bring himself to

find time to make a written report. Told definitely that he must write

a report and gives a deedline, he meets the deadline and the report is

everything it should be.

12. His reports on his recruitment meetings,

said, were

excellent. No jumping to conclusions, no padding, no misinterpretations,

no omissions.

13. The surveillance team captain, reading ONE's report on his

actions during the countersurveillance

exercises, parvelled at the

completeness, total accuracy of description of the surveillants PHOE

bad made, including their ages (but always made each man an inch or

two shorter than the actual height . which PHONE adritted he does

constantly), and the total recall of every move, every street crossing,

every compass direction. (In the first countersurveillance exercise,

sprung on PHONE vithout a moment's prior notice, he made one of his

two surveillants.

In the second one, with plenty of time to prepare,

he made all three of them.

These were two different teams from the

office of Security).

Concluding his admiration of PHONE's

reporting, the surveillance tean captain said to the instructor:

should be very proud of him".

14. In both exercises, the surveillance teans criticized the

rapidity of PHONE's movements. He walks very rapidly from place to

place, then spends time to browse in a book shop. Then off again at

a high rate of speed to his next stop.

They also criticized his looking

both ways while crossing a one way street. They felt it made him appear

I is quilty of the identical actions. We are highly

icinetic in our novements and as for looking both ways while crossing a

one-way street, we follow the old Karine Corps adage:

"There's always

one S.O.B. that doesn't get the word". By sheerest coincicence, when

the instructor was on his way to the safesite to deliver the surveillance

tean's report, he violated his on rule of looking both ways ir: crossing

& one-way street and was bowled over by a hirpie on a loaded bike -

going the wrong way.

Only the large heavy file case the instructor

was carrying kept him from being knocked flat.

I5. Nevertheless, PlOB 18 now fully cognizant of the appearance

that bis actions create and t11l watch it in the future.

16.

One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: He

chose his positions well and he camouflaged his actions beautifully.

One example:

the instructor called the surveillance team for a quick

feedback on

the first exercise and caught the men just as they returned

to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.

They reported one Incident as follows:

"So rapid were PHONE's rovements,

that

when he net & friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with him,

Just waved him off". The second

surveillant:

"go, it didn't look like

that at all, to me.

To me It looked like this Indian-looking person

stopped FHONE and asked him for directions and PHONE sAve them and just

went

about his business".

PHOE's on report, which he wrote up before

he learned about the two different interpretations of the Incident:

" where I stopped & foreign-looking man, apparently Indian In origin

and asked hin for the Museum which I knew perfectly well is on 55th

Street.

I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted

the same man in the grey suit, now holding his hat in his hand".

17. In the second exercise, there were two items of note:

the team was surprised to note in PHONe's report that PHONE even had

the name of the book that the surveillant picked up when he followed

PHONs into a book store.

Second, when the exercise was over, the team

compared notes and decided that PHONE may have made two of them but

could not possibly have made the third man.

The team captain, on reading

PHONE's report, was stunned to see that PHONE had indeed made

man also, but good.

18. PHONE had an elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop

After relating the fine job that FOil had done,

His choice of neeting places with his agent could not be

held himself out to be, would properly be seen dining).

very circumspect, he did, nevertheless, let the Instructor know that

be has, on occasion been handled with sonething less than pure genius.

alert both desk and field officers that this man, being very sure,

positive, definite and strong, hopes to be handled in a manner that

would have those same words apply.

AGENT EVALUATION

NAME:

QRPHONE/1

PROJECT:

QRPHONE

DATE:

18 January 1971

STATUS: Contract Agent (Under

a Memorandum of Oral

Agreement)

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,

Including Jaoist, African liberation,

Q/l's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q1 continues to perform well and

without posing problems for his handler.

His personality is

easy-going and his attitude positive.

If his efforts are not

always totally successful . leaving us with tantalizing bits

of information and many uranswered questions . this is generally

due to opeiational circumstances in which he

was simply unable

to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job

as a journalist.

He has acquitted himself well both as a

representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.

Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and

in this connection the operation profits particularly from the

energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself

has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/l's attitude is positive. (See below

under lotivation.)

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/l's attitude is good. He has made

an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement

and to

understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former

cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on

which a good deal has beensaid over the

course of this operation.

The following points can be made on the subject of @/1's

motivation:

A. His basic image of JIANCE is positive.

SECRET

3987N4957 2I5n6

---

## Page 49

SECRET

B.

This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional

organization has

been enhanced in Q/l's case by the

circumstances of

his agent relationship, which require

very professional handling.

Indeed Q/l has probably come

to hold a rather glamorous

"storybook" image of JKLANCE

and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE

effort.

This

is a very human trait and should not be

exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti-

JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves

to

accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of

a very il pressive outfit.

C. In his political

evolution over the years, Q/1

has become active in at least two "causes".

In both

instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy

and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally

harmed as a result.

The product of this situation has been

a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political

outlook.

Following on the foregoing thought is the fact

that he is an American (and does not consider himself

that be views this as "squealing" on his friends - indeed

the contrary seems to be the case.

E.

On a more mundane level, it must be realized that

Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial

straits.

He was without a job and was living off the charity

of his wife's family.

JKLANCE has given him a job, paid

him reasonably well

and has enabled him to

be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F.

Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination

of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1

clearly likes his work.

He enjoys dealing with international

issues and political subjects.

He enjoys the travel and

the opportunity to exercise his language capability.

short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which

he has been able to live appeals to him.

In assessing the relative importance of these

several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-

signed would stress that C and E were probably

the immediate

causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more

underlying.

B and F have arisen since recruitment and

probably play an important role in his current motivation.

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Ql's wife is not witting of his

JKLANCE aftiliation.: She was allowed to believe that he was

working indirectly for the Chinese.

She certainly is aware

of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at

Q/1, but as far as Q/1 can determine (and this is not a subject

on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she

continues to accept the Chinese story, It should be added

"left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes.

It should also be noted

that the relationship between the two

of problems thereby

adding

to the complexity of the situation.

Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activitles is one which

Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed

lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that

Mrs. Ql seens to accept as legitimate the small amount of

money received from Q/l's cover and to regard this as a genuine

stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant

personality and responds well to Case Officer handling.

than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a

If anything, he may sometimes be too willing.

to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational

considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.

However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon

him.

"this connection it should be recalled

that his ability

to respond fully is usually restricted by

the nature of his

relationship with his informants; i.e., since he

is only eliciting

the information from unwitting

informants he is rarely able to

press for all the desired details.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has

and a security pledge.

We hasten

to add that Ql is not a bandling problem and there has never

been any instance in which either he or his handler has had

occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1. has a good sense of personal security and his

handler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/1'g

and an extro diacasion to dii's cover situation.

We have no

indication that any of

these allegations are based on any proof,

nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of

contacts.

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 1s a self-starter and can

work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADHINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q1 poses only a minimum administrative

burden.

He is not overly concerned about his administrative

and financial position, allowances, payments, etc.

He merely

expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him.

However, on the

rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,

he can be very upset.

REPORTING:

Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective

reporter - both in terms of ability to elicit and writing

style.

his efforts on a sustained basis.

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this

his agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional

training), and the prospects of making himself attractive

to the Chicoms (again preceded by appropriate training).

In pursuit of the latter item I talked at length

the FE Division expert on

I de

scribed in detail QRPHONE/l's background,

current status,

and the variety of plans we have in mind

and received

reactions as follows:

A. The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE

has demonstrated thus far will never result in his

becoming of interest to either the Chicons or the

Soviets for any operationally meaningful purpose.

While the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential

FI source, the Chicons would not even do that.

B.

Chicon officers abroad are still totally

obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic

and tactical application to a degree significantly •

more zealous than their Soviet counterparts.

Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets

the Chicoms discard persons of shallow substance as

far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned.

They are interested in only those who have a serious

intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and

a serious revolutionary goal.

The thousands of leftists

of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen

as only of marginal use to the Chicoms and certainly

not the

sort that they would take into their confidence.

The key here is to

demonstrate not that QRPHONE/l is simply sympathetic,

with Maoism or any other Communist shading but that

he is a dedicated serious revolutionary.

SECLET

1: DEC 178

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chlef, Covert Action Stall

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

ORPHONE

Your Memorandum, Same Sabject.

Dated 29 November 1971

• I. What follows below are some Initial comments of mine on

the referent memorandum, per your request. We really feel in

Branch 3 that for a varlety of reasons, we need more time to

deliberate on QRPHONE's future operational actlvity than the

previous two weeks. Partly this la due to extended absence by the

case officer in charge who has been plagued with a recurring

Illness--I belleve you are famlliar with this. It is also In part

attributable to the Section Chief's being new to the positlon and

having his time abaorbed by matters of current priority. So ll you

don't mind, we should like to address ourselves further to this

subject following the Christmas holidays. At that time we should

Ilke to Initiate some meetinge on thie matter both with yourself

and with other area components including representatives from

C1 Staff.

2. Background: Your memo, of course, was triggered by

an earlier one of mine which proposed that QRPHONE become

operationally engaged in attempting to establish a black Communist

cell

The purpose of thie would be twofold

namely, to exacerbate relations thereby between the Soviet Union

and mainland China through varlous low-key covert action undertakings,

and in the process to further enhance ORPHONE's own credentials

as a Maolst activist. This tentatlve assignment, it should be noted,

arose because Branch 3 personnel had become Increasingly aware of

the possibility that ORPHONE's project status might be terminated

In the not too distant future. While It is true that in the immediate

preceding month or so, we have benefited from his intelligence

reporting, It is all too clear that over the past two years, he has

been of diminishing utility to CA Stalf and other area divinions. In

discussing his future with his recent case officer

her recommendation was that unless something could be found for him

In the near future, we should give seglous consideration to terminating

SES 2T

his services during the coming year. Thus my foregoing proposal

arose from a dealre on my part not to terminate an asset of proved

capabilities without giving the agent in question suitable opportunity

to become useful once more.

3. CI Type Review/ORPHONE Personal Security: Your memo

makes out there have been frequent security reviews of ORPHONE's

mecurity status, and you question the efficacy of our doing still one

more. On this let me point out that in making such a security assess.

ment, we would be doing so in response to a current request by the

ares divislon concerned whose cooperation we need to direct this

agent. One hardly needs stress that such a request probably should

• be honored In the Interests of maintaining good relations even If Ite

fulfillment means redundant work. But apart from this, the case

officer also informa me that the case file does not contain any general

summary of the alleged security breaches Involving ORPHONE and

thelr Implications vie-a-vis hla activitles. It is true however that his

security status has been revlewed for each annual project revlew and

that assessments of his security status were made following each

alleged breach, but no up-to-date summary existe. As for our ow

gut feelings on his personal security, one hazards that he ls still in

pretty good shape. I agree with you that many of the past charges

leveled agalast him are of the same ilk as those leveled against other

leftlet colleagues(who do not have any Agency association) by their

rIvals. And as for the structure of his case officer relatlonship.

that la, having him handled by a deep cover officer from an adjacent

country--thle would appear to be secure in the extreme (so much

no that one would advocate that It be dropped due its operational

Inelficlency.)

4. Location: We tentatively agree that In all likellhoodl

should not be the venue for our proposed operatlonal undertaking due

the location

however, might do very well.

It not

perhaps you or EUR Division might suggest another

locale. As for the question as to whether or not the

station would

want him permanently, only time and his own : perational success could

determine this. One hazards that If ORPHONE were able to make bls

way with some good local leftists and had promise of developing some

kind of relationship with mainland China representatives, the station

might come to regard him as a capital asset.

5. Substance: You noted that ORPHONE... "cannot just

sImply show up and start a leftist nuclel..." Why not? Others

have. He is a well-known leftist In intellectual circles In Europe

and has weltten masy articles in praise of Mao. This should do

for a start. As for what he might have to offer local leftiate . .

money, energy and Ideas will do. A great deal of money, of course.

In unneeded, but some is. We can supply it. As for Ideas and

energy, he has both. Concerning the "bullt-la jealousy, almoalty,

ete. " which such setion would likely engender on the part of local

elval leftlets, this may or may not occur. But le this such a calamity

If It should occur? Are not leftists usually fighting among themselves

anyway? In any case, we have nothing to lose by trying to salvage

thle agent.

What we have to lose by not trying ls an agent asset of

proved worth.

6. Credentiale: You say in effect that ORPHONE has not

been known as an activlet but only as an Intellectoal. (Frankly, the

distinction is not very Important in my mind.) Be that as it may, he

has written many articles on leftist subjecte and has talked to

Innumerable leftists around Enrope over the years. True, he has

not been involved in such actlong as street demonstrations, but we

would not llke him to be so personally Involved in the future In any

case. What we would want him to do ls to write pamphlets, Informally

recruit assoclates to hls group and provide a little money to the group

as might be reguired for varlous undertakings. Aside fror the

organizing and funding, actually thla la not very dillerent from what

he has been doing --except that It will be in one place for a change.

7.

You may be very correct in saying

that shopping him around to European stations L

le a

poor way to solicit useful tasks for ORPHONE. But again, I took".

my lead from C/EUR/CA who made a request along these lines,

willing at some future time to visit various field stations and to

attempt selling ORPHONE's services personally, we wou'd be happy

to have him do so. We, of course, don't know when he will be

avallable to do so, and time is passing.

B. Concluding Comment: I really feel that we should relate

to you in some detail the success which

once had with the

kind of undertaking which we have proposed for ORPHONE. It may

Interest you. On the other hand, it may be perfectly posalble that

the altuntion which

priate officers in CI/SO and Africa Division.

I have been

advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/l's dwindling

productivity are as follows:

A. Key centers of activity of the radical left

In Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm.

different reasons QRPHONE/l's access in these three

capitals is either circumscribed or off target.

His reputation among target

has

groups of interest to us

been so tarnished that he has not,taken into their

confidence significantly enough to be of value.

B. Although he has a multitude of contacts among

the left, virtually all are shallow, periodic, and then

very brief when they do occur.

Even his correspondence

to the more important radical leaders, which used to be

quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing.

Because his contacts are so cursory, he has

been unable to develop a close and continuing personal

relationship with any one of them in order to develop

the intimate confidence so necessary for operational

exploitation.

His cover has always been thin and thus has

circunstantially

at least lent credence to the periodic

allegations of his being & JKLANCE agent.

Close case officer direction has been made

very difficult because of the echelons existing

between QRPHONE/1 and LCPIPIT, coupled with relative

infrequency of field case officer meetings.

F.

What contacts he has within the African

target, for example, are rendered virtually useless

because his case officers are unfamiliar on & timely

basis with Africa Division requirements and also

miss valuable operational leads simply because they

do not recognize them.

(This is no fault of the

case officers because

they obviously have little

opportunity to keep abreast of such requirements.)

G.

The somewhat artificial nature of his trying

to portray a pro-lao stance may help him a bit with

targets

sinilarly inclined but renders him ineffective

with other political shadings among the left.

With all of the above in mind and without belaboring

the history of this project, the following recommendation

offered and has been concurred in informally by CI/SO and

•Africa Division officers with whom I have talked.

A. Accepting the fact that QRPHONE/l's operational

utility in Europe

is minimal, I propose LCPIPIT be

directed to begin making arrangements for his transfer

PCS to Africa and, hence, his operational control

transferred to Africa Division as soon as feasible.

From the point of view of NHCHAOS requirements

and Africa Division's own reguirements,

both elements

felt QRPHONE/1 could best be exploited

It is one of the two most active cities in Africa for

the radical left, it is a hot-bed of both Soviet and

Chicom shenanigans, and it is politically vital to

East African stability®

C.

However, because of ORPHONE/1's well-known

association with two exiled

politicians

and current reports that these

oppositionists are piotting the overthrow of

promptly throw him into jail.

This is to be done in concert with a

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CA/B-3

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

Your Memorandum, Subject: QRPHONE

Operations in Europe, Dated 24 November

1971

1. I made some notes in the margin of referent memorandum upon

first reading it. However, since these are too brief, I thought it best

to let you have my thoughts on this matter in fuller form.

2 As you may know, we had tried for years to give QRPHONE more

meaningful assignments, but there are certain facts about him and the

operation today which simply cannot be ignored. It seems to me that

I your memorandam takes inadequate account of these factors.

Security:

and QRPHONE's personal security

cannot be faulted, in my judgment.

However, that has not protected

QRPHONE from accusations of being CIA, which have haunted him

throughout the years. This is such an endemic charge in the milieu in

which he operates that I feel certain he would have had the same charres

leveled at him

ba Location: Apart from the efficiency

there are a number of good reasons arguing against the desirability of

A different cover for a move to

might be developed,

but not that of a Maoist developing new cells.

_Station is glad to

have him come there and give them "grass roots" reports whenever

he visits, but would they want him permanently? ?

C. Substance: More generally, ORPHONE cannot just simply

show up and start forming nuclei . there are already Maoist nuclei

the various Marxist-Leninist parties (miniscule though they may be)

that existed, and they continue to exist with or without Chinese help.

If he were to have something to offer them -- money, preferably

they might welcome him with open arms. Otherwise he will encounter

built-in jealousy, animosity, rivalry, and a source of accusation all

over again.

d. Credentials: As a Maoist intellectual (or an intellectual

Maoist? ?), QRPHONE can travel all over. As a Maoist activist, he

has only minimal credentials. The only group he is actively involved

with is

- and even with that he has

never carried a placard, and I doubt if he has even helped them with

making up a placard. He has helped them with their press releases,

leaflets, etc.

In short, with the written word, not the deed.

By

nature which we must also take into consideration . QRPHONE

is no longer a "doer" - if he ever was one. And I doubt very much

that he can at this stage in his life become a "doing" radical.

We would

be misusing his natural talents, which could still serve us well, in

favor of dubious undertaking.

In effect, the proposal (if I read it correctly) is to have

ORPHONE develop a group which would serve to distribute anti-Soviet

material. I cannot judge if that would be worth the cost ($40, 000? ?)

[but I doubt it. I also do not know enough about thel

operation to comment on that aspect, particularly as to its feasibility

in a sophisticated European community.

Shopping him around to the European

Stations is the wrong approach, in my judgment. In the first place,

any Station likely to have a use for him is already extremely well up

on ORPHONE's background. There are only.

heavily involved in anti-CP ops (in which field I suppose this would fall),

have former CI/ICG men who know QRPHONE well:

ORPHONE has talents and abili

ties and weaknesses which can best be explained/sold in person, not

through dispatch.

I "CI-Type" Review: A review of the file will show how often

this has been done, and how thoroughly. (I can understand

asking for a security review -- he had no background knowledge of the

operation that would have given him this information.) I do not know

what you now expect to find.

In all frankness, and unless CI Staff feels

the need for yet another review and is willing to undertake it, I would

consider a Stati-internal review pretty much a waste of time.

3. Having gone around this problem several times in the past

several years with CI Staff and the pertinent area division. (as the

files will clearly show). I am most doubtful that any of them will consider

ORPHONE of sufficient interest (current or potential) to pay what it

costs to maintain him. We may be able to justify it since we attempt

(as no one area division would) . and to some extent succeed .. to target

him on a multi-divisional basis

In light of these considerations, and

since I have developed serious reservations on the long range viability

of this operation (in terms of the cost-effectiveness factor), I believe

that the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment of

the project. After some internal discussions, this will also, of course.

entail consultations with the CI Staff and at least area divisions.

* I will appreciate receiving your comments by mid-December.

MENORANDUM OF MEETING

SUBJECT: ORPHONE Operations in Europe

1.

I EUR/CA, and myself briefly

discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 November.

During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal

which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at

LCPIPIT in mid-October.

In substance,

this proposal was

that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through

Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either

for an extended period of time.

In either of

these locations he would then attempt to identify and

to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting çontacts

in the left sector of tle student and youth population,

who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study

group.

QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so

inasmuch as he is

an established writer of the Maoist

stripe.

His relationship with these contacts or followers

would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational con

text.

Rather, he would guide and motivate such contacts

as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist

group, and would claim to have been a member of a larger

so his to towers that he 1s attempting to develop a

He would, of course, imply

similar nucleus in

or whenever, as

good Communists should.

2.. Operational activity would be of a twofold nature.

First,

exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists

would follow

along lines of a typical black Communist

cell. emulating the kind of notional movement which

developed in the Middle East some seven or

eight years

ago.

Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in

turn, would

each recruit two or three other sympathizers

who over time could distribute anti-Soviet literature and

perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the

Station,

and which could be attributed to the PRC.

Presumably their actions would result in some local

embarrassment to the USSR

and the PCI.

Second, QRPHONE,

himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials

already strong-to the point where he might well become

'4, The charge is made that QRPHONE is too thinly

spread and there is a recurring urge that his targetting

be better focussed.

Can he in fact be better focussed

on a multi-divisional basis or would focussing, in

practice, result in his being narrowed down to a primarily:

divisional target?

5.

Granting that the CIA label is somewhat in-

discriminately used for character assassination in the

conspiratorial fringe in which QRPHONE has been operating,

isn't he in fact stuck with this label and in view of

the international

character of this conspiratorial

Iringe, won't it turn up wherever he goes?

In this milieu

1s there rcally much chance he will be given any signifi

cant information (and not deception information) by anyone

who will do so because he wants the information passed

to CIA?

When he was looked into in April 1968 by a

Chicon official, what do we suppose to be meant by the

officials finding that it was not clear if he was

completely reliable in a Marxist Lenist sense?

8. With a reportedly anti-US,

and

children, how really mobile is QRPHONE in a

sense?

If we should move QRPHONE and family to a new

location for a trial period and it didn't work out,

wouldn't resettling him have considerable complications?

In how many languages does QRPHONE have verbal

and written fluency?

our use of QRPHONE?

Now that the PRC has decided to go "legit,"

what is our best estimate as to the likelihood that they

will lose interest in previous and current pro-Chicon

fringe groups?

Other than on the above, if we asked QRPHONE

to become involved in depth with one of the groups he

1s in touch with, wouldn't he have to act "more Royalist

than the King," and wouldn't he be the first to come

under suspicion in case action against the group pointed

What are QAPEOVE's real talents? Why hasn't

he been able to do more about establishing himself on

a more self-s staining basis?

Is it because of the

targets we keep pushing his on?

What is meant by these

allusions to QRPHONE's "work discipline?"

Do his talents

possibly point toward some covert action use in a role

where the CIA label is relatively less important?

•5• As to QRPHONE/L, SMOVID on 15 June 1970 followed up his March

1970 complaints to JADAIN about QRPHONE/l's Contacts with expatriates

] concern about QRPIiONE/l's sccurity

and its view that QRPHONE/l's information was of icarginal value.

SHOVID

emphasiring that he was expressing a view personally endorsed by

SMUPSILON, outlined three possible options:

vithdraw QFPliONE/1 from

the country; stop running and tasking QKPHONE/l as

an agent; or have

take over the running of ORPHONE/L.

(ORPHONE/1 subsequently was

instructed to stop pursuing his SMORANGE targuts.)

Thus JKLANCE is stynied. The question is whether there is

anything that can be done to improve the situation.

The one new factor

in the equation that possibly could be used to reopen the discussion

with a view to ascliorating the situation is the fact that there now

AGENT EVALUATION

NAME:

QRPHONE/1

PROJECT: QRPHONE

DATE:

18 January 1971

STATUS: Contract Agent (Under

a Memorardus of 0r2).

Agreement)

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and

without posing problens for his handler.

His personality is

easy-going and his attitude positive.

If his efforts are not

always totally successful. leaving us with tantalizing bits

of information and many unanswered questions - this is generally

due to operational circunstances in which he was simply unable

to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job

as a journalist.

He has acquitted himself well both as a

representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.

Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and

In this connection the operation profits particularly from the

energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself

has faced sinflar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: ORPHONE/l's attitude is positive. (See below

under lotivation.)

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/l's attitude is good. He has made

an eftort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to

understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former

cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement

with enthusiasm.

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on

which a good deal has beensaid

over the course of this operation.

The following points can be made on the subject of Q/1's

motivation:

A. His basic image of JIANCE is positive.

• SECRET

---

## Page 95

B. This image of JKLANCE as à powerful, professional

organization has

been enhanced in Q/l's case by the

circumstances of his agent relationship,

which require

very

to hold a rather glamorous

professional.handlinb."gtorybook" image of JKLANCE

Indeed. Q/1 has probably come

and of the importance of his contribution to

the JKLANCE

effort.

This is a very human trait and

should not be

exaggerated in his case,

JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to

accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of

• very impressive outfit..

C. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1

has become active in at least two "causes".

In both

instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy

and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally

harmed as a result.

The product of this situation has been

• certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political

outlook.

(In other circumstances this might be called

political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends

as a detached observer rather than a participant.

Following on the foregoing thought is the fact

that he is an

American (and does not consider himself

disloyal).

Given his citizenship and his disinclination to

feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he

has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE

to report on those currents.

He does not give any indication

that he views this as "squealing" on his friends - indeed

the contrary seems to be the case.

On a more mundane level, it must be realized that

time when he was in serious financial

straits.

He was without a job and was living off the charity

of his wife's family.

JKLANCE has given him a job, paid

him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled

be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F.

Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination

of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that @/1

clearly likes his work.

He enjoys dealing with international

issues and political subjects.

He enjoys the travel and

the opportunity to exercise his language capability..

the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which

he has been able to live appeals to him.

In assessing the relative importance of these

several factors which make up Ol's motivation, the under

signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate

causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more

underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and

probably play an important role in his current motivation.

## Page 96

SECRET

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: WI's wife is not witting of his

JKLANCE affiliation.

She was allowed to believe that he was

working indirectly for the Chinese.

She certainly is aware

of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at.

21, but as

far as wl can determine land this is not a subject

on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she

continues to accept the Chinese story.

"It should be added.

that Mrs. Q/1l

is the holder of some rather

typical "left" anti-JkLANCE attitudes. It should also be noted

that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety

of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.

Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which

Hrs. Ql views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed

lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that

Ars. Ql seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of

money received from Q/l's cover and to regard this as a genuine

stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant

personality and responds well to Case Officer handling.

a most willing asset requiring no special handling care - other

than the normal professionalise expected in the handling of a

sensitive asset such as Q/l.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to

accept guidance and criticise - provided it is constructive.

If anything, he may sometimes be too willing.

His willingness

occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls

to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational

considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.

However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon

him.

this connection it should be recalled that his ability

to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his

relationship with his informants; l.e., since he is only eliciting

the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to

press for all the desired details.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and be has

signed recruitment documents and a security pledge.

We hasten

to add that Q/l is not a handling problem and there has never

been any instance in which either he or his handler has had

to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1 has a good sense of personal security and his

handler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.

As cited above, Q/l's enthusias sometimes leads to his failure

to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/1's

affiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment.

add an extra dimension to @/1's cover situation.

We have no

indication that any of these allegationg are based on any proof,

nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of

He pointed

out that his big problen is having to retein substential amounts of

information in his head for two or three weeks, then put it all down

the night before he reets his Case Officer. Fron his conversation,

it appeared that organizing a report had never occurred to hit before

and he several times said "no one ever toid ne aoout this", "this is

the first I've learned of this, etc." These things were said in happiness

at having discovered ways of improving his reporting and simulteneously

making his reporting less of a chore and nore of a joy.

migration officials when he entered the lounge. He then went to the

duty free shop to purchase a bottle of Scotch and a carton of cigarettes

Starting salary, June 1965

$600 per month

1 September 1966

$700 per month

1 July 1967

$800 per month

• All of the above figures are tax free. In addition, as of I May 1969, Subject

was given an additional $50 per month (also tax free) as our contribution

boward some form of Insurance agalnet the future (endowment, lump sum

cash value, or whatever the Fleld and he finally selected). Thie appears on

the books as a salary Increase. However, although to his ultimate advantage.

It doea result In a small decrease in take borne pay since Dil is sino required

to make a contribution to the payment of the premium.

2. In addition, Q1l's MOC also provides for $10, 000 Indemnification In

ease of death, or payment of $600 per month up to $10, 000 to his wife la case

of his total Incapacitation or disappearance while employed by CIA. Allowance

had originally been made for this provision when he seemed to have an excellent

chance for travel

¿this year we Included the provislon as a general

benefit, not tied to any particular type of hazardous travel alone. Finally.

thls year's amendment to hla MOC also Incladed a severance bonus of one

month's salary for each year of satisfactory service. We placed $3, 200 ls a

"pecial eserow account to cover his previous four years' service, and are

providing in our Project renewals for each year's required deposlt to that

escrow account. Please note, however, that this benefit has not yet been

to some of the criticisme that have been leveled at his production, the fact

remains that I bive not seen any marked Improvement during the past two

yaare la the quality of the material he provides us. As time goes on and

the reallotie criteria of what le disseminable and what le not are applied

more and more to his production, and this production In turn remains at Ita

present level of superficlality, we will see less and less of it quallly for

dissemination, Since he le an FI agent, this has considerable significance,

although it of course does not present the full pleture of his capabllities. His

operational Intelligence has been received with mixed evaluations; usually

his Initial coverage of a subject Is very well recelved and often whets the

appetite of the reciplent for more; somehow, however, that "more" never

seems to materialize they get more of exactly the same caliber, but

little more in terms of dopth of reporting. Perhaps the fault lies la ORPHONE/,

in which case we bould realize early that what we have here is not a trie

FI agent, but a sort of "operational Intelligence butterfly." Perhaps, on the

other hand, the fault les In

handling of the man, not In terms of

the personal relatlonship which

has been able to bulld up with him,

but maybe even because of that relationship. I remember when I first talked

with

I quickly realized that be felt he knew more thas Headquarters

as to what was Important for Q/l to cover and what was not; I am sorry I

home leave has been postponed, for I had hoped to determine for myself

whether

stll felt that way. Whetever the reason, I am by no means

giving up on OX, but will continue to try to narrow down his targets so that

he wil have a falt shake at showing what he can do when he is not allowed to

cover the waterfront.

4.

What the above paragraph la leading up to, le that I do not in all

honesty feel that he has done anything to really deserve a promotion, except

balld longevity since the last one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that

newspaper job offered to him (bis preference, In any event), However, I do

realize that a man must have an Incentive, and would like to propose that we

suggest to

that a more realistie increase might be la the nelghborhood

or $100 a month, and that the severalse bonus mentioned in paragraph 2 above

might now be surfaced both to

and to Q/l as a new benefit

It is now some six years later and ORPHONE/1 (at least

overtly) is employed as a legitimate journalist.

He is not a

member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss authorities-

although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of

in pur. uit of his operational tasks.

ORPHONE/ 1

has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland--

in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that

if the swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should

also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland.

ORPHONE / 1

obviously feels personally about this, and it may be that future

operational benefit could be gained if ORPIIONE/1 were again able

to enter Switzerland.

3. We are forwarding

under separate cover a copy

of a report

written by ORPHONE/l following his contact with the Swiss Embassy

We are also forwarding under separate

cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he

formally states his reguest that the entry ban be lifted.
