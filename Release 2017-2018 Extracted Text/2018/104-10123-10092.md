Pending the results of these inquiries we herewith ‘pass you the
following inforaation additional to that sent to you by our
CAH/52/589 of 11-6-'52, that you may the sooner be able to form
an accurate idea of the case. :

in April 1951 your Lendon, representative reccived from the
British’- acording to information received by us from them - 4
report on the statemeats the Dutch subject Henri Chiistiaan PIECK,
porn 19-4-1895 Den Helder, made concermming his activities for the
ais. la this report occur the names of 'HAdS", alias "HARRY", and

La", alies "Theodor MALY", alias Paul HARDT, while two dra-
wigs were attached to the report, which PIECK had made of
"EOD.EG" - Ienace 2hISS, and of "HANS",

In the book "This Deception" (published by BUELL, SLOAN &
PEARC. - New York) the authoress iede MASCING tells, that in the
first half of the thirties she was in contact with Ignace R&ISS,
SORGE, KalVITSKY, Paul HaRDT, ana »PELIK", In the beginning of
the Yth Chapter (p. 68) the authoress ives a description of Ri-
chard SORGu, sayias among other things: "His cold blue eyes,
slightly slanted and heavy prowed, had retained their quality of

i for no reason at ar
Ss Goincidence, that PIECK in describing "HANS"
"always appeared to be smiling", and "was slightly Asiatic
in‘ appearance", though in some fursher points the two descriptions
do not auite tally, there is a possibility that "HANS" and SORGE y
are iuentical, and that for this reason that SORGE was in the forme
half of 19535 ap;ointed correspondent for Japan by the "Algemeen
dandelsblaa” of Amsterdam, and "HAUS" had reportedly been commis—
gioned to go to Jupan (though according to PINCK he had not obeyed
the instruction). No doubt Hede MASSING made much more detailed
statements to the F.B.I. on her activities for the 21S than those
laid down in her book; she must also have given descriptions of
the persons with whom she was in contact.
PIECK gave physical descriptions of his e overs in. the 21S. It
is recommenduble co examine whether the two deseriptions of Paul
RwT taliy, and whethe ie. WnSiiNd may be able with the help

shoulda particularly be grateful for the investigation of
