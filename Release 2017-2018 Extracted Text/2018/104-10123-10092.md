Your HS-755 of 14-2-'51; further to our

CAn/ 52/589 of 11-6-'52.

UBJ CT: Investigation into the KrIVlishs case

the tira of CADA;

"TANS" and "THEODOR MATY

"e are at present reexamining the TRIVIISKI case and are

maxing guin inquirios about the firm of(tidA)of Insterian men-

tionod in your a.do letter.

Fenuing the results of those inquiries we herewith pass you the

folloving infornation additional io that sent to you by our

CA3/52/599 of 11-6-'52, that you may the sooner be ablo to form

an accurate idea of the case.

In April 1951 your London represensative recoived from the

British' - accruing to infornation received by us from them - a

report on the statements the butch subject henri Christian PIECK,

In this report occur

, alias "HARRY", and

"PLTER"

, alias

"Theodor MALY"

, alias Paul HARDT, while two ara-

wings were attached to the report, which PIECK had nade of

"LODIG" - Ignace HISS, and if "INS".

In the book "This decertion" (published by dUEl, BLOAN &

- New York) the authoress Heue inScING tells, that in the

first half of the thirties she was in contact with Ignace RiISs,

SORGE, KRIVITSKY, PaUl BARDI, and "FILIK". In the beginning of

the von chupter ip. o8) the authoress Lives a description of Bi

chard SORts, saying among other ühings: "His cold blue eyes,:

slightly slanted and neavy browe,

had retained their quality of

100king amused for no reason at all"

It seens à peculiar coinciuence, what PIECK in describing, "HANS"

says: "always apreared to be smiling", and "was slightly Asiatic

In appearance"

though in some further points the two descriptions

do not quite tally, there is a possibility that "HANS" and SORGE

are iuentical, and

that for this reason that JORGE was in the forme

half of 1953 apiointed correspondent

for Japan by the "Algeneen

randelsblad" of

Amsterdan, and "HAilS" had reportedly been commis-

sioned to go to Jupan (though accoruing to fICk he had not obeyed

the instruction). No doubt fede MASiNG made much more detailed

statements to the f.B.l on her activities for the RIS than those

laid down in her book; she must also have given descriptions of

the persons with whom she was in contact.

PIECK gave physical descriptions of his eminyers in the ils. It

is reconmenduble jo examine whether the two descriptions of Faul

HuT talid, and whether dede luscid may be able with the help

of PIECK'S

irawing of "anis" anu the description to

entity the

intres, It woulú be advisaole also to show to jede :4290i 22221

iv=s of Ignace nISs to be able to check whether after i lige

years II.CK haa been able to irav a good likeness of his

corner employers, and has done so with great fidelity.

He should particularly be grateful for the investigation of

the KRIVIISKY case to possess copies of the statements ileue

inosiNG maie concerning her contacts with the is, aud of khIvITu-

Ky's stutements regurding his contacts, targets, and other useful

intomation.
