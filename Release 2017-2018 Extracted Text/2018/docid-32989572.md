CP EFFORTS TO INFILTRATE NAACP
CONVENTION

NY T-1 on May 11, 1962, advised that a
meeting of part of the CP, USA National Nesro
Commission was held on Mary 5, 1962, at the Chelsea
Hotel, New York City. ‘The major portion of this
meeting was devoted to Ciscussing matters pertaining
to the NAACP and of the coming convention of the NAACP.
The main report was given py TED BASSETT, who recapped
some of the problems in the NAACP. BASSETT noted
the failure of the Party to take advantage of the
many situations that have been presented by virtue
of the struggles that have taken place, He said
| that one of the problems that the NAACP has, with

-2-

NY 100-7629

she Atlanta convention, is the matter of
nin the hotels. He stated that
Atlanta will permit desegregaticn
ot21s during the NAACP conver nm, but
both befove and aiter the convention
the segregation policy. In other
sation will be lifted while the
ing on and delegates to the

have all ‘the privileges of the

regard to

conventi.oi
hotel.

Next BASSETT recapped the developments in
civil righss by the NAACP since 1952. He indicated
that the NAACP national policy has been to serve as
a brake on the aggressive tendencies of the member-
ship. This tendency has been evidenced in the
resolutions submittod at the previous conventions.
Now the NAACP leadership finds itself in a position
in which they have to examine this situation.
BASSETT brought out the fact that directives have
been issued by the National Office of the NAACP
which only give lip service to the resolutions
submitted to and accepted by the convention. He
said that they never put themselves in a position
in which they could be charged with not doing what
the convention passes on, but they do it in such
away that it is ineffective. He cited as an
example the fact that the last convention had
called for the issuance of an emancipation
proclamation and noted that such a proclamation
was issued, but it was a watered-down version,

. BASSETT further mentioned that the youth
had been able to win some concessions in 1960, but
were not nearly so successful in the 1961 convention.

-3-



NY 100-7629

He stated that. 2,000 delegates were

expected to attend the 1962 convention and that
the theme of the 1962 convention would be the
fight for the ballot and for job opportunities.

During the discussion on the NAACP Convention,

it was brought out that the Party finds itself

in the same situation that it was in last year,

prior to the convention, ‘That is, that the Party
. forces have not gotten togetHer and, therefore,

the Party must operate at the coming convention
without the cooperation and ‘coordination necessary

to effectively influence the convention.

The informant reported that WILLIAM
PATTERSON spoke and in his remarks indicated that
there is a crisis in the Negro movement. He
Spoke of things that the Party has done, but in
which the Party has not made any organizational
gains. PATTERSON stated that the CP has been
able to get a lot of things moving, but through
oe this, the Party has not made any organizational
gains. :

BENJAMIN DAVIS also spoke and Stated that
although the CP influence is felt, "we" do not make
gains. "We are reduced to the characterization of
Communist professors. If we cannot take an
organization like the NAACP and cannot solve its
problems, then we are not going to make it."

DAVIS pointed out that, "How can you
explain year after year the activities and maneuverings
of the. various NAACP Conventions, in which people are in-
fluenced undercover, and yet after which we are never
any better off in facing the next convention than we
were before the last convention? Somewhere along the

“line the CP must examiné this to find out what
is wrong,!!

JAMES JACKSON spoke and stated that he
thought he had a couple of proposals that he felt
were possible, even though the time was getting
late. He stated that he thought that perhaps
LESTER DAVIS, identified as a CP member from
Chicago, could get some resolntions for submission
to the NAACP Convention and if that falls, then
maybe others could do it in other areas. If
this fails, then perhaps the resolutions could
be introduced at the convention itself. He then
proposed that a resolution be introduced and that
the forces work fo» a massive legislative lobby
that would mobilize the NAACP's full resources and
Seek to secure cooperative efforts from other
organizations on the basis that this is the 99th
year since the Emancipation Proclamation and the
CP wants to pressure Congress and the President
to call for an Emancipation Proclamation,

JACKSON proposed that the CP work for a
three-day holiday or work stoppage in commemoration
of 100 years of deferred rights.

The informant reported that in the’ discussion
which followed these proposals, it was felt that
those present did not think too much of the
possibility of getting a work stoppage or work
holiday, however, it was felt that something could
be obtained regarding the Emancipation Proclamation.
It was felt that this could be done by working
through the youth to get them to form a massive youth
march,

CP held its first meeting in connection with the
NAACP Convention at the Royal Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia,

Party would be coming up short at the convention.

CP members present at the convention was held at the
Royal Hotel. At this meeting it was decided to
support the hotel picketing in Atlanta. In addition,

-7-

_NY 100-7629

the only topics discussed at these meetings were

the possibility of introducing a peace resolution
and possibly changing the resolution passed annually
banning Communism. The Party desired to change

the anti-Communism resolution, but did not think

a direct attack on the resolution would have any
chance of success. *

The informant stated that it was learned
on July 7, 1962, that the resolution for changing the
name of the NAACP had failed because the resolution
received no support on the floor of the convention.

NY T-6 advised that a final meeting of this
CP group was held on July &, 1962, and the tenor
of the meeting was discouragement, because only five
persons had participated on behalf of the Party.
LESTER DAVES was particularly upset and stated that
the Party should either make a good showing or not
try to do anything at all.

NY T-6 advised that it was his opinion that
i the CP accomplished little or nothing at the convention
and. it did not influence the outcome of the convention

: in any significant way.

at the Royal Hotel, Atlanta, Georgia. ALVA BUXENBAUM
was in attendance at this meeting and indicatéd that
she had no status within the convention, but was there

“west region, but was défeated. ‘This was considered
by the CP caucus as a serious setback because it
destroyed the only possible effective vehicle within
which the CP could work to influence the policies of
the convention,

The informant reported that the CP
program at the convention was as follows:

anna)
1. To work for a resolution calling for
a@ youth march, wt

2. To work for a resolution calling for
a national observance of the Emancipation Proclamation
to take place sometime between November 1, 1962
and January 1, 1963.

3. To work for a resolution to call fora
Presidential Emancipation Proclamation to end all
Jim Crowism in America.

The informant learned that TED BASSETT
had stated that this was the most pooriy organized
NAACP Convention from the Party's point of view, but
that the Party delegates would have to do the very
best they could. He stated that the thing to do
was for each person sent to determine what
people were functi cn a national level on the
Resolutions Committee and with which ones it was
possible to establish friendly relations, This
would have to be done in a short order if such
relations were to be established prior to resolutions
being introduced at this convention.

a

Those present agreed to canvass the
convention to make every effort to locate Party
delegates and other "left" appearing delegates,

who might offer an opportunity for help within
the convention. They agreed to meet daily ~
to discuss progress and to meet for a final
session, at which time a general assessment of
the convention would be made. This would be
valuable to the National Office of the Party
in assessing the work of the NAACP.

The informant idarhea that at another
meeting of the CP caucus thé Party members » SUBIEST cy
expressed disappointment in making contacts with
convention delegates and they noted that the Party
was weak and lacked organization at the convention.

aan) delegate from Boston, was observed at the convention,
“|. a8 well as an unknown CP female delegate from New
York.

CP FUNCTIONARIES MEETING

NY T-8 advised in July, 1962, that a meeting
of leading CP functionaries was held at CP headquarters,
New York City, on July 11, 1962.

At this meeting TED BASSETT gave a report
on his impressions of the recent convention of the
NAACP. BASSETT commented that he attended the
convention as an observer and the most important
development was that the NAACP took direct action
on integration. This vas expressed py all the
speakers, There were 1,225 delegates present,
whereas last year there were 1,714 delegates,
Membership in the NAACP in the past year dropped
8,197, which was due, according to their report, to
a loss in the industrial centers, due to economic
reasons,

NY 100-7629

BASSETT related that at the convention
the NAACP went on record again of calling for the
abolition of the House Un-American Activities
Committee (HUAC). They also attacked the
Eastland Committee, but pushed the anti-Communist
resolution, in spite of the fact, as pointed out,
that the NAACP was the victim of anti-Communist
attacks. The NAACP is concérned about THURGOOD
MARSHALL's lack of Senate confirmation for United
States Judge and are going to ask NAACP branches to
send delegates to see various United States Senators.
The NAACP contrasted the big expense of the Peace
Corps with the failure of the government to
spend anything in relation to Mississippi and called
for the removal of Southern representatives from
Chairmenship of House and Senate Committees,

The informant advised that following
BASSETT's remarks, JAMES JACKSON stated that the
NAACP remains the decisive, well-organizec center
of the Negro struggle. The struggle on she
political front is related directly to the economic
question and the unfolding suffrage drive.

WILLIAM L, PATTERSON commented that the
NAACPS calling for the abolition of the HUAC is
a tremendous advance and "we" should support this
action, He suggested sending a carefully worded
letter to the NAACP supporting them on this matter,

GUS HALL remarked that the convention was
truly historical and "we" should have a person on
a national level that can mix with the NAACP.

NY_T9 on May 7, 1962, advised that

GUP-HALL is General Secretary, CP,
USA.

NY 100-7629

The informant also advised that it was
announced at this meeting that the chapters of
the NAACP are not geared for mass activities.
The Party has to help on this and "we™ have to
realize that the NAACP branches are the focus
through which "we" must operate.

ARNOLD JOHNSON stated that the Party
can sharpen the struggle on the basis of Negro- ene”
white unity. "We" must give attention to the
youth section of the NAACP, which is a militant
section.

“NY T-10 on December 14, 1959, 7

NY T-3 on July 12, 1960, advised that at.
a@ meeting of the CP Illinois State Committee held
duly 8, 1960, in Chicago, Illinois, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT
gave a report on the NAACP Convention.

LIGHTFOOT stated that he/Afshned to give a
different report on the latest developments of the
Negro people's struggle, -but since that time a number
of things had taken place, including the NAACP Convention,
which ne and a number of other comrades had attended.
LIGHTFOOT stated that he therefore felt it expedient
to give a full report on the NAACP Convention and touch
briefly on other aspects of the Negro people's struggles,

LIGHTFOOT stated that it was his feeling that
the 51st National Convention of the NAACP, which took place
in St, Paul, Minnesota, was a very significant convention.
He added that his overall estimate of the convention
was that it was a very positive convention. There were
a few negative points, but these were outweighed by the
positive aspects of the convention,

LIGHTFOOT said that the convention was held
against a background of the growing collapse of werld
imperalism, The dominant forces among the Negro people
today are those who associate themselves with
militant mass acticn, The NAACP finds itself in a position
where it has to change its tactics in order to
maintain its status,

: In summing up the positive aspects of the
convention, LIGHTFOOT Listed tiie following points:

1, He felt there was, within: the convention,
the recognition of mass action as a principal method
of struggle.

,
2. The convention reflected a new movement
and revolutionary moods, i

In citing the negative aspect of the convention,
LIGHTFOOT stated that there was nw review of past
policy, He stated that the CP cannot go on forever
building, creating or working with movements that
limit the Party's potential for growth within them,

NY T+4 in July, 1960, advised that a meeting
of the CP, USA Secretariat and invited guests, was head
at CP Headquarters, 23 West 26th Street, New York City,
on July 13, 1960.

At this meeting CIAUDE LIGHTFOOT gave a report
on the NAACP Convention, LIGHTFOOT noted that the
convention took place against a background of the
emergence of independence for 16 Negro led African states,
He said that this was. having a profound effect on
millions of American Negroes and was becoming an
important point in American foreign policy. He contrasted
this against the present internal situation of the United
State: wherein he said that the struggle for Negro rights
is not progressing. In speaking of the convention,
LIGHTFOOT commented that the convention was divided into
panels dealing with leadership,pclitical action and the
use of economic weapons and others,

LIGHTFCCLT commented that no substantial headway
was made in terms of integrating young people on a policy
level, The young people had influenced the convention
more than any other class of people. LIGHTFOOT commented
that in his opinion, the primary thing was that the
leadership of the NAACP, in the past decade, has had no
conception of what is required to win freedom in the
United States, He said that the convention was froe- of
"red baiting" in the principal sppeches,and panels, :

NY 100:7629

LIGHTFOOT said that "we" were pitifully small
in number and the main problem is that "we" have very few
Commnist-Led movements in the organization, adding
that he believed that they have taroxn out of the organization
those that were in it.

NY T-4 advised that following LIGHTFOOT!s report,
a discussion period’ was held, WILLIAM WEINSTONE@stated
that it was necessary to take up the struggle against
‘Communism in the NAACP." BEN DAVIS*felt that the Party
must support any and all organizations that further
the Negro Peoples Movement and he said that the NAACP is an
essential organization to express the aim of the Negro
people. DAVIS regarded the NAAUP an an important
organization in the Negro Peoplets Movement.

Continuing, DAVIS remarked that the actions
of the organizations in the Negro People's Movement
will determine how the Negro will actiand how the Negro
will vote, DAVIS stated that it was/the Party's advantage
to build the Negro People's Movement in the South and
the Megro American Labor Council (NALC) in order that
the NAACP will not continue to deminate the thinking
of the Negro. He said that the Party must point out that
"ped baiting" is the one remaining way in which the ruling
class of this country maintains its ties with the Negro
People's Movement,

The informant advised that CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT .
agreed withthe comments made by BEN DAVIS and said that
the, Party shoulcexplore the possibility of building
a cadre among these organizations. LIGHTFCOR added that
eg must move to increase its cadre within the

Informant advised that LIGHTFOO.S then made
the following proposals;

WB

DocId:32989572 Page 79



KY 100-7629 |

“The 51st Annual Convention of the NAACP opened
at St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday, June 21, 1960, with
headquarters at the Municipal Auditorium, St. Paul, and much
of the activity centering around the St. Paul Hotel.

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, Chairman, CP of Illinois, appeared
in St. Paul early in the morning of June 21, 1960, to
contact his associates. LIGHTFOOT was in St. Faul to
coordinate and direct CP strategy in an attempt to influence
the NAACP Convention. LIGHTFOOT indicated that his "key men"
at the convention, through whom he would try to work, were
OLIVER MARTIN}*a CP member from New York City,, who was a «if
delegate to the National Convention, and ROBERT..HYMER, a CP ~,-
member from Chicago, who was an alternate delegate, to the ent -
convention. HYMER eventually became a delegate
on June 22, 1950,

It had originally been suggested that PETTIS PERRY,~
a CP official who is familiar with NAACP affairs, was to
have come from the West Coast to attend the St. Paul convention,
but LIGHTFOOT stated PERRY was unable to do so because of the
fret oied involved, and accordingly, LIGHTFOOT was taking
is place. 4

LIGHTFOOT's early instructions to CP members active
at the convention were to push housing for Negroes by re-
commending the establishment of a National Housing Committee
and a definite legislative program assuring open occupancy
on a national level. The CP also urged act interest
in discussions involving youth participation in segregation
protests and preparing youth for NAACP leadership, which
were items on the agenda set up by the National Office of
.the NAACP,

In connection with individuals in attendance at the
NAACP Convention, OLIVER MARTIN, CP member from the Bronx, was
observed on June 20, 1950, in connection with pre-convention
activities. MARTIN occupied Room 316 at the St. Paul Hotel
and was attending the convention as an official delegate from
the Bronx, New York group of NAACP.

aiemead lanes (NY B36 Report Continued) .

BARBARA TILLER: from Chicago, who has been connected
with the Progressive Movement in the past and is scheduled
to be asked to join the CP, was observed at pre-convention
activities on June 20, 1960, and was attending the convention
as an alternate delegate from the Morgan Park Youth Council
Section. TILLER is active in youth work in Chicago and is
vice-president of the Morgan Park“Youth Council. TILLER
was staying at Room 664 of the Ryan Hotel.

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT was supposed to have arrivedin
St. Paul on Monday, June 20, 1960, but was not observed until
Tuesday morning. On the morning of June 21, 1960, LIGHTFOOT
tried to register as an official observer at the convention,
but when the official listings of observers were subsequently
released later during the morning, it was noticed that his
name had been seratched out on these listings and that he had
not been accepted by the registration committee in this
capacity.

The opening session of the convention started at
1:00 p.m., on Tuesday, and/during these early convention :
Sessions LIGHTFOOT introduced himself to various .NAACP wee
officials, including RO LKINS, NAACP Executive Secretary,
and tried to develop friendty contacts with some 6f these
individuals, but the very mention of -his name caused
considerable consternation among NAACP leaders and
convention delegates. When the Chicago delegation to
the convention noticed LIGHTFOOT's name scratched out on
the observer, sheets, they were all aware and concerned over
his presence at the convention.

Accordingly TED R. Basser®? a New York reporter
for "The Worker", stated during the afternoon session that it
had been decided that he, BASSETT, was to serve as liaison
man for LIGHTFOOT during the convention and would contact
individuals for LIGHTFOOT and arrange meetings, etc.

NY 100-7629 (Ny T-6 Report Continued)

"In connection with the meeting held at’Room 221,
Ryan Hotel at 11:00 p.m., Tuesday, June 21, 1960, which had
been announced by a note circulated by TED BASSETT,
New York Reporter for "The Worker," the following is
noted:

ALBERT TANNEY "tn whose room the meeting was
held, is known to be a CP member at Chicago, and was
attending the NAACP Convention as an observer.

LIGHTFOO® instructed those present in what was to
be done in connection with the convention:

1. OLIVER MARTIN, who had been invited to this
meeting but had not attended, was to push resolutions
concerning jobs (Fair Employment Practices).

2. JANNEY was to circulate a folder and cover
letter to convention delegates, This pamphlet, captioned
"Freedom Now! A Plan to Increase the Political Power of
Negro Citizens," dated June, 1960, and issued by erases
LEMUEL E,”“ BENTLEY, Midwest Conference of Negro Voters,
and BENNETT J, JOHNSON,“Executive Director, Chicago League
of Negro Voters, Post Office Box 6133,

Chicago 80, Tllinois. ‘The cover letter to be circulated
with the pamphlet was on the letterhead of the Chicago
League of Negro Voters and introduced HERMAN -@TLBERT and
ALBERT JANNEY as official delegates of the Chicago
League of Negro Voters to the NAACP Convention. The
letter was signed by BENTLEY and JOHNSON.

SuUb4

3. The CP wanted to introduce and obtain
support for a resolution on Civil Rights, which resolution
had been written by ALBERT JANNEY, apparently at the
suggestion of LIGHTFOOT, This resolution declared that
the 51st Annual Convention of the NAACP should state
emphatically that no candidate nor platform would be
accepted which did not call for the following:

(f.) The appointment of a Negro to fill the first

The group discussed the difficulty in intro-
_ ducing this resolution to the convention and-considered

the possibility of approaching Dr. WARREN SPENCER,
Evanston, Illinois, NAACP delegate serving on the Resolutions
Committee, in this connection. There was no indication
during this discussion that SPENCER was in any way
sympathetic to the CP or to any of the individuals involved,
but only that he might be used as an innocent instrument
for this group, It was decided to consider this further.

Crh rai is.

It is to be noted that all of these above-mentioned
resolutions pertain to items that are already of interest
and concern to the NAACP convention workshops, ic.,
voter's rights, housing, Fair Employment Practices,

During this meeting on June 2], 1960, it was
learned that BENNETT JOHNSON of Chicago, a CP official
in Illinois, had called JANNEY long distance and had
indicated that he, JOHNSON, might be in St. Paul
later during the convention.

The following day, June 22, 1960, OLIVER MARTIN
stated that he was to have attended the meeting at
JANNEY's room the night before, but that he had become
lost and was unable to get there.

On the late afternoon of June 22, 1960, after

the convention workshop sessions had terminated,
CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT advised a few of his friends that he

_ Was concerned and discouraged over the lack of progress
made by the Party in trying to influence convention
activities. He indicated that to date these activities i
had generally failed; that ROBERT HYMER had failed to
be elected to the National Youth Work Committee and had
been unable to have any influence in that area;
that Party-instigated attempts to introduce a resolution
urging housing matters had failed and it was
being abandoned.

LIGHTFOOT said that ALBERT Janney had not been
very active circulating theramphlet on the Negro's
Political Power which he was supposed to be circulating
in connection with the Chicago League of Negro Voters;
and that to date no delegate had been located to introduce
to the convention the Civil Rights resolution written
by JANNEY,

LIGHTFOOT stated that he planned to attend a
convention workshop on Wednesday, dealing with the
Negroes' use of economic power and urged other CP
members to attend convention workshops,

During the late afternoon session at the NAACP
National Convention at St. Paul on June 21, 1960,
TED BASSETT, who is a reporter for "The Worker" in New York
City, contacted several individuals at the convention and
advised them in writing of a meeting to be held at 11:00
p.m., that night in Room 221 at the Ryan Hotel, St. Paul,
Minnesota, That night, shortly past 11:00 p.m., it was
noted that the following individuals were among those
present in Room 221s

HERMAN C, GILBERT and ALBERT
JANNEY, who are’ active in the
Chicago Negro Voters League
and are CP members;

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, and ROBERT
HYMER, a CP member from Chicago
who was an alternate delegate to
the NAACP Convention,

Dering this meeting LIGHTFOOT laid down the CP
tactics for upcoming sessions of the National Convention,
and called for suppert for a resolution calling for support
of measures to bring about equal rights for Nesroes.
LIGHTFOOT indicated that although one CP member at the
convention was originally to have pushed a resolution
on housing, these instructions were being revised and a
resolution on youth activities was to be pushed.

It was also learned that OLIVIR MARTIN, a
delegate to the convention from New York City, was in the
CP faction and was to push two resolutions at the National
Convention; one on jobs and one on South Africa,

In the late evening of June 22, 1960, OLIVER MARTIN
called a meeting in his room, Room 316 at the St. Paul
Hotel, This meeting was attended by various individuals,
some of whom were obviously not CP members. Among those
in attendance were the following:

CLAUDE LIGHTFGOT intentionally did not attend
this meeting so as not to alarm the non-Party people
as to his CP connections.
OLIVER MARTIN generally ran this meeting and urged

the presentation of three resolutions to the convention,
as follows:

-~15-

NY 100-7529 (NY T-6 Report Continued)

1. A peace resolution which had been
written by HERMAN GILBERT, OLIVER MARTIN
himself will try to present this rdolution.

2. A Civil Rights resolution which had
been written by ALBERT JANNEY, which HYMER
will try to have introduced to the convention.

B- A labor resolution which they would

try to have introduced by someone not necessarily
a OP member. It was hoped that FI?ZGERALD

would take action on this resolution.

MARTIN called another meeting for this group for
11:00 p.m., Friday, June 24, 1960, in his hotel room.

At the close of business sessions at the convention
on Thursday, June 23, 1960, which sessions were devoted pri-
marily to the meeting of Regional Workshops, ALBERT JANNEY
stated that attempts to introduce his Civil Rights
resolution had failed to date; that HYMER had given it to
a minister in the Chicago delegation who was not a cP
member, and that no action had been taken on the resolution
so far. As of that time it was felt that CP members
active at the convention, had not been in any way active
in pushing their causes, and that during the
workshop sessions on Thursday, no CP members were known
to have been vocal or active in any way.

: Saturday, June 25, 1960, was devoted to the
Convention Plenary Session on Legislative Matters, and
during this session the CP, through its few controlled
delegates, was not active to any degree from the
epee floor and had no influence on convention
affairs.

After the general legislative session on
Saturday, TED BASSETT, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT and associates

(NY T-6 Report contrnued)

held a brief conference at the Convention Hall. BASSETT
and LIGHTFOOT each indicated that the Plenary Session
had "been a bust" as far as tle CP was concerned,

It was also learned on Saturday that the meeting
scheduled for 11:00 p.m., Friday night in OLIVER
MARTIN's room, #316 at the St. Paul Hotel, had
not been well attended. This meeting which had included
non-Party people, had been directed toward obtaining:
support by these people for GP resolutions, but it was
apparent from the lack of activity on Saturday during
the general session, that this meeting had
accomplished. nothing.

On the morning of June 24, 1960, ALBERT JANNEY,
Room 221 Ryan Hotel, conferred with HERMAN GILBERT and
others concerning the failure to date to obtain any
concrete results in the presentation of resolutions
urged by the CP, JANNEY indicated that his Civil Rights
resolution had apparently failed in the Resolutions
Committee, however, when the NAACP resolution on Civil
Rights would be presented to the convention, they would
have a last ditch try at making amendments from the
floor in connection with this resolution. JANNEY
indicated that the labor resolution was still "in the
mill" and.indicated that perhaps BITL,FITZGERALD from Argo,
Tllinois, a delegate to the convention, would carry
through on this resolution.

At noon on June 24, 1960, after the morning
Convention Plenary Session, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, who had
attended the morning session, contacted a few of his
associates at Convention Hall. LIGHTFOOT was concerned
about what had ‘happened to the Civil Rights resolution
which had been written by JANNEY, and upon learning
that it had apparently failed to be presented to the
Resolutions Committee, LIGHTOOT indicated he would
have to challenge ROBERT HYMER on his failure to properly
handle this assignment. At that time CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT



NY 100-7529 (NY T-6 Report Corftinued)

announced that there was to be a meeting in JANNEY's room,
number 221, at the Ryan Hotel, at 10:00 p.m., Saturday
night, to evaluate the CP's work at this convention,

It is to be noted that at no time during the convention
was there any proposal on the part of LIGHTFOOT or the
others, to try and block the “red baiting" resolution

on Communism always passed at these NAACP conventions,

At the direction of CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, a meeting
was held at 10:00 p.m., on Saturday, June 25, 1960,

. in a hotel room on the second floor of the Ryan Hotel.
The announced purvose of this meeting was to evaluate
the CP's work at the NAACP Convention. This meeting
was poorly attended, with only a few CP members present,
including LIGHTFOOT, As the meeting got under way,
CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT called for some observations by those
in attendance, as to the positive and negative results
of CP attempts to influence convention activities.

OLIVER MARTIN stated that he thought this year's
convention had been better than in the past, and that in
spite of the passage of the "red baiting" resolution, the
Party had succeeded in inserting a shorter work week
amendment in the laborresolution. MARTIN indicated that the
group he had met with Friday night had generally deserted the
cause on the floor during the Saturday session, and that
apparently they were not the right people, He indicated
the Party should place more people in NAACP activities
because only voting delegates were of any value at a
convention such as this, and only two or so delegates at this
convention were CP controlled and even they were
restricted by conservative elements,

It was generally agreed that more uork should
be done by the Party in the branch level presenting
proposals for resolutions far in advance of the
convention date, gaining support for their causes, and assuring
thelr election as delegates to the convention. Someone
indicated that it was hoped the Party could get many more
delegates to the NAACP convention next year in Philadelphia.

There was some discussion on the fact that the
re-organization of the NAACP in many communities, from
smaller units into larger big city branches, had
handicapped the CP and generally diminished the effect
of any Communist infiltration, ROBERT HYMER stated
that although the Party had had no particular influence in the
NAACP youth work at the convention, the NAACP itself had
developed an ambitious and militant program which was
generally in keeping with the CP's objectives.

TED BASSETT indicated he would write an editorial
for "The Worker" in connection with the convention and
stated he would confer further with OLIVER MARTIN in this

A connection on their return to New York.

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT indicated that he was generally
dissatisfied with the CP's accomplishments at the
convention, but that it was gratifying to see that the
NAACP Youth Movement was developing rapidly and that the
NAACP had taken initiative in aligning itself and
working harmon} ously with other mass organizations, labor,
etc., which was in accord with the Party's program, He
generally agreed that the Party had not been too
influential at the convention in view of its weak
representation among the convention delegates and because
of the fact that the NAACP had developed a full and
ambitious program on its own.

AS a result of this discussion CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT
proposed that the Party should establish a National Committee
on NAACP affairs, ~

From LIGHTFOOT's comnents it appeared that
PETTIS PERRY who has previously handled the NAACP work for
the Party, has had this assignment taken away from °
him and has been replaced by LIGHTFOOT,

generally about the Negro question, noting that the Party
was better prepared for participation in various’ conventions

LIGHTFOOT stated that the Party should have more
discussion and preparation in order to prepare for the advancement

advised that the CP held a caucus at the Sheraton Hotel,

of TED BASSETT, from the New York area, It was agreed at this
caucus that the CP would attempt to have the following
resolutions passed at the convention:

NW 55136 DocId:32989572 Page 117

 sarmepeonenmernerne ere —n



NY 100-7629

1. Resolution for a united front of
Negro organizaticns under the leadership of the
NAACP on problems confrouting Negroes.

2. Resolution supporting the Freedom Riders,

3. Resolution calling on the President to issue a
second Emancivation Proclamation in support of
éivil fights,

NY T-4 on July 21, 1961, advised that LESTER DAVIS had
been assigned by TED BASSETT to write resolutions in which the
cP was interested. TED BASSETT instructed also that ROBERT
HYMER should make an effort to get elected to the Resolutions
committee at the NAACP Convention in order to facilitate the
passage of resolutions in which the CP is interested.

NY T-4 on July 21, 1961,
advised that LESTER DAVIS
and ROBERT HYMER are CP members.

NY T-4 on July 21, 1961, and NY T-5 on July 18, 19,
‘1961, advised that on July 10, 1961, ROBERT HYMER was elected
to the Resolutions Committee of the 52nd Annual NAACP
Convention as a representative of Region 3, which consists
of the States of Tilinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin,

NY T-4 on July 21, 1961, reported that the Resolutions
Conmlttee consisted of four officers and 11 subcommittees.

learned that LESTER DAVIS on July 10, 1961,nad drawn up

Proclamation by the President.

NY 100-7629

This informant continued that the resolution calling
for a united front of Negro organizations under the:leadership
of the NAACP on problems confronting Negroes had already been
drawn up by the Bronx Branch of the NAACP and submitted to
the Resolutions Committee through normal channels, At a CP
caucus meeting held July 10, 1901, at the Sheraton Hotel it
was agreed that the CP would support the Bronx Branch resolution.

This informant added that the resolutions were
mimeographed and ready for distribution on July 11, 1961.
TED BASSETT handled the mimeographing since he had contacts
in the Philadelphia area. .

NY T-4 on July 21, 1961, advised that it had come
to informant's attention that when ROBERT HYMER submitted the
three resolutions to the secretary of the Resolutions Committee,
she accepted two of them, The so-called united front resolution
was rejeced since an identical resolution had previously been
presented by the Bronx Branch of the NAACP,

NY T-5 on July 18, 19, 1961, advised that, according
to rumors, informant had heard there was some friction developing
within the CP group at the convention. On July 12, 1961, the
resolution of the Bronx Branch of the NAACP calling for a
"Summit Meeting of Negro Leaders," (united front) was rejected
by a subcommittee of the Resolutions Committee,

In addition, another resolution submitted by a
New York branch of the NAACP asking that the National Office
confer with state offices before taking a stand on political
issues was defeated by a vote of 11 to 10.

This informant learned that TED BASSETT was furious :
when he learned of this, particularly since the OP representative
on the Resolutions Committee had voted to reject the resolution,
It was informant's understanding that the CP role is to try
to weaken control of the National Office of the NAACP over
various branches in order. to create disunity and factionalism.

This informant further learned that the Freedom Riders

resolution had been “watered down" in the Resolutions Committee
to the pont where it was considered innocuous.

-T-



NY 100-7629

Insofar as the so-called Emancipation Proclamation
resolution was concerned, informant was told that it would
be included in the preamble to the general statement of the
Resolutions Committee, Therefore, a separate resolution was
not felt necessary. At this point, the CP decided if they
were to have CP favored resolutions adopted, they would have
to. be introduced from the floor oF ‘the convention as
amendments. i

NY T-4 on July 21, 1961, advised that on July 13,
1961, TED BASSETT instructed CP members to refrain from
raising questions on peace or the testing of atomic devices,
as it was felt to be "too risky."

NY T-5 on July 18, 19, 1961, advised that an
amendment was made on the ftoor of the convention on July
15, 1961, to change the Freedom Riders resolution, putting
the NAACP on record as to whether Freedom Riders should or
should not accept bail rather tnan be jailed. After a lendhy
floor fight, amendments failed to gain support and the
resolution was passed in the form it was revorted out of
committee.

(It is noted that information previously appears
in this report describing tne resolutiuon adopted
concerning the Freedom Riders as innocuous.)

{ais Informant continued that when resolutions on
civil rights were introduced, an amendment was proposed from
the floor which was almost identical with the resolution
calling for a second Emancipation Proclamation by the
President. There was only a slight change in the wording as
compared to the resolution originally sponsored by the CP.
This indicated to the informant that the unidentified person
who introduced the amendment from the floor was possibly a
cP member, ‘The representatives from the National Office who
were on the stand had no objection to this amendment. It
was read and handed to the secretary and will be included
as an amendment to the eivil rights resolution.

NY 100-7629

This informant also stated that an amendment calling
for abolition 6f the House Committee on Un-American Activities
(HCUA) for failure to investigate anti-Negro organizations
was introduced on the convention floor by a member of the
Resolutions Committee, name unlmown to informant. This
resolution was voted on and passed. The passage of this
resolution came as a great surprise to the CP,

This informant also stated the Resolutions Committee
failed to list an anti-Communism resolution on the published
list of resolutions. Voting on the resolutions was almost
over when someone on the Resolutions Committee, identity not
recalled by informant,*introduced it. The resolution was
voted on and passed after some discussion. ‘The informant had
no information indicating that individual CP members on the
floor of the convention participated in this discussion.

Extent of Communist
Infiltration and Influence

NY T-4 on July 21, 1961, advised that a CP caucus
meeting was held on July 14, 1961, which was in the form of
an evaluation session. There was some criticism to the
effect that the CP member on tne Resolutions Committee had
not insisted on. a word by word acceptance of CP resolutions
but had allowed them to be consolidated with other resolutions
on the same subject submitted by various NAACP branches, It
was agreed that the CP had accomplished more than in previous
years; that as long as the essence ofthe OP resolutions
were contained in the resolutions redrafted by the
Resolutions Committee, the CP should be satisfied.

NY 100-7529

This informant advised that OLIVER MARTIN, delegate
from New York, stated at this caucus that two CP sponsored
resolutions were passed in whole or part; namely, (1) support
of Freedom Riders and (2) Emancipation Proclamation resolution,
He added that the resolution to abolish the HCUA was passed
to the surprise of the cP, who supported it when it was presented
to the convention.

NY T-5 on July 19, 1961, advised that
OLIVER MARTIN was’ a CP member from the New ~.
York area,

NY T-5 on July 18, 19, 1961, advised that there was
a further evaluation session which was held July 15, 1961,
by the CP, The comment was made at this meeting that the
placement of a CP member on tne Resolutions Conmittee was
the most significant achievement of the CP in that it would
provide a kase for CP resolutions at future conventions.

It was emphasized that the CP should begin preparations
for the 1962 NAACP Convention in Atlanta. CP members were
urged to fight for a more organized approach by the CP, It
was stressed that greater coordination of CP members coming
i future conventions from various parts of tne country must
e realized,

It was also emphasized that resolutions to be
introduced at the 1962 convention should be initiated through
local NAACP branches.

This informant advised that the facet that the
convention passed a resolution calling for abolition of the Houa
was believed by CP members to be a sign that the trend in
the NAACP is away from a violent anti-Communist attitude,

Informant continued that JAMES JACKSON, who was to

be in charge of CP activities, did not come to Philadelphia
_ duping the convention. Asa result, TED, BASSETT and OLIVER

NY T-6 on duly 27, 1961, advised that based on
informant's activities from club to district level,
Commnist Party of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware (CPEPD), over
a period of years, CP members and officials tend to magnify
their successes and play down their failures. Informant
observed the CP will take credit for enactment of various
programs, for election of local political candidates, for
passage of progressive type legislation, etc., whereas,
in most cases, CP contributions are small and seldom get
beyond the "talking stage." While resoluticns similar to
CP resolutions were accepted at the NAACP convention, it does
not necessarily follow that OP influence was dominant since
these resolutions may have been passed had no CP members
been present, Informant concluded that in a convention the
size of the 52nd Annual NAACP Convention, considering the
number of people participating and the complexity of this
type convention, any true assessm3ant of CP successes or failures
is cifficult to reach.

: NY T-6 further commented that THOMAS NABRIED had
criticized the national CP leadership for not setting up and
carrying through a coordinated plan of activity whereby all
delegates sympathetic to the CP could have been welded together
in a cohesive force. Preconyention planning by the CP,
according to NABRIED, was slipshod and uncoordinated,

"Those of us who are opposed to Communism should bend every
effort to keep the Communists out in the open, not to suppress
them py law or by force. They stould be opposed politically,

by showing how their support of truly liberal causes always
harms such causes, and that their only real purpose is to
advance the interests of Soviet Russia and defend her dictatorship
and her acts of aggression, To try to. suppress the Communists
would merely drive them underground or-into various camouflaged
organizations and would harm, not help, the task of opposing

their ideas,

immune from criticism, They've had more than their share of
abuse from some quarters, but perhaps not enough from others.
They are entitled to their opinions, and I will fight for their
rights to them; but tne rest of us are entitled to state our
conviction that the herd-mindedness of Communist and near=
Communist blocs has worked to corrupt the processes of democracy
in the unions, and that the irresponsibility of the Party-~both
leaders and herd--in the period of the Russo-German

pact manaced the world and properly left us dubious about Communbt

a Comm ..ist policy, as loud-moushed and w ir as the rantings

which Communists give themselves to the causes in which they
believe, even when the cause includes support of Poss Hague of

why Russia accented the pact, as, for Russia, the best way out

shouting in defense of it that Churchill's England and Hitler's
Germany were equally bad, and I cannot comfortably cooperate
with Americans who took that dangerously irresponsible course,

that he first met Dr, BUNCHE at a meeting of leaders of the
Communist fraction of which the National Negro Congress was
organized in Washington, D.C. ‘The purpose of the Communist
fraction meeting was to formulate vlans to assume Communist control
of the National Negro Congress, PATTERON said that during the

was known to very.few members of the OP.

~38-

NW 55136 DoclId:32989572 Page 191



NY 100-7629 ,

by the Communist fraction in oréer to maintain control over the
National Negro Congress so that its activities could be
directed and controlled by Commnists, JOHNSON advised

that this meeting was held at the office used by JOHN P.

DAVIS.

MANNING JOBNSON recalled thet at this meeting
Dr. BUNCHE was introdused to him individually by JAMES W.
FORD as a CP member, It is his recollection that BUNCHE
was introduced to the meeting again as a Party member,
JOHNSON stated that BUNCHE cautioned that the Conmunist
influence and direction of the Negro Congress should be
kept from becoming obgious.

JOHNSON said that he had not previously known
Dr. BUNCHE to be a member of the CP and never saw him at
any other meetings of Communist leaders, He said that
BUNCHE's membership in the CP wes made known to the
Central Committee of the CP and a few top level members,
as it was believed he could be more valuable to the CP if
he was not openly known to be a member, He stated that
JAMES FORD and JOHN P, DAVIS acted as liaisons between
Dr. BUNCHE and the Central Committee of the OP,

JOHN P, DAVIS, publisher of "Our World", 35 West
43rd Street, New York, New York, reported by MANNING JOHNSON

at the organizational ccnference of the National Negro
Congress and was considered one of its founders. JOHN P.
DAVIS stated that at the time of its origin, the National

_Negro Congress was a completely respectable organization
and that in his opinion the Communists were not a dominant
influence until the 1940's, He said that it was possible

hat the Communists in the National Negro Congress did
try to get control of it from the beginning but were not
successful, He said that he considered himself to be the

NY 100-7629 us

founder of the National Negro Congress and the leading
organizer of the 1935 congress, DAVIS said that in many
respects he was pro-Ceammanist at the time of the 1935
congres., but indicated he had not. been a member of the

cP and consequently had no information concerning any
meeting of the CP fraction at the 19355 conference, He said
that he knew of no association on the part of Dr. BUNCHE with
any of the @ leaders at this conference or at any other

time or on any oecasion on which Dr, BUNCIE might have

spoken or met with CP leaders, DAVIS said that he has

always considered Dr, BUNCHE to be anti-Communist, citing

as an example a conversation he had with Dr, BUNCHE i:

the mid 1930's.in which Dr. BUNCHE, who had just returned
from China, expressed fear that China was in serious danger
because of the increasing strength of the Chinese Communists,

During the course of another investigation conducted
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Dr. BUNCHE stated
that he believed the idea of the National Negro Congress
was fundamentally a good idea, and that so long as PHILZIP
RANDOLPH was President, the attempts of the Communists to
dominate the organization were generally unsuccessful. He
said that in 1940 at the Third National Convention of the
National Negro Congress at Washington, D.C,, RANDOLPH made
a speech critical of the Soviet Union after which Communists
took control of the organization and elected MAX YERGAN
president t replace RANDOLPH who resigned, Dr, BUNCHE
said that he had very little to do with the National Negro
Congress after 1935 and the First Annual Convention in
Chicago in 1936. He said that since he was in accord with
Mr. RANDOLPH's position in opposing the Communists at the

column 3, reported THEODORE SPAULDING as ore of several
signers of a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, which
stated that the CP in common with other parties is entitled

peace and interested in protecting the rights of the foreign
born. It is against the BEN GURION Government of Israel,
bomb testing, anti-Semitism, Negro discrimination, and the
rearmament of West Germany.

The source related that the ELF renders support
to and receives support from the ‘Morning Freiheit”™ and
any other Jewish progressive organizations.

The source also stated that the ELF is recognized

by the CP, USA as an important progressive national
organization of women,

hospital appointments or privileges, in medical schools,
on hospital staffs and against patients; to re-establish
the freedom of the medical press, the Forum urges medical
society publications to open their volumes to diverse
views on controversial subjects; and to provide a forum
wherein socially liberal doctors may express their views
in opposition to the policies of organized medicine.

. "initiative for organizing the PF came from the CP, came

from the ninth floor (35 E. 12th Street, New York City),
where the National Committee of the CP existed."

explained that a small group of the YPSL was dropped,
expelled, or suspended from that organization and joined
the SYL, which he characterized as the youth group of the
"Trotskyite ISL." He explained that after these few former

to change its name for its own purposes.

On April 9, 195€, another confidential informant
advised as follows:

The YSL has frequently worked in close sympathetie
cooperation with the ISL toward similar objectives, although
each major issue given mutual consideration is decided upon

apprenticeship for the ISL, but ISL selection of members from
YSL ranks is made on an individual and personal basis. In
many instances YSL members are also members of the ISL,

of the danger that confronted our nation and con-

calling for a resounding defeat of GOLDWATER and the

The ELF issued a leaflet entitled, "A
Vote for Goldwater is a Vote for the Ultra-Right",
which stated:

"We are a non-partisan organization and do not
endorse candidates. But we cannot be neutral. We
remember how SIX million Jews, together with millions
of Polish, Czech, Ukrainian and Russian men, women
and children were driven into slave labor camps
for the Krupps and the Thyssens in Germany and
from there into concentration camps and the crematoriums.

- And we cannot forget how Hilter came to power.
The crime the German people committed against
humanity began when they allowed Hitler to come to
power, The time to stop the Ultra-Right from
coming to power is NOW! |

“COMMITTEE AGAINST NAZISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM

A source advised on January 25, 1960, that a
meeting was sponsored by "The Worker," an east coast
Communist newspaper, on January 24, 1960, at the Park
Plaza, New York City. EVELYN WIENER, described by the
source as the chairman of the New York County Communist

. Party (CP), invited the audience to attend a protest

meeting to be held in Union Square, New York City, on
January 26, 1960, to protest anti-Semitism in West Germany.

A second source on January 26, 1960, advised that
the CP had prepared 6,000 leaflets in connection with anti-
Semitism to be distributed at a rally to be held that day
at.Union Square, New York City. These leaflets, according
to the source, were not distributed since the CP was not
openly represented at the meeting. However, according to
the source, known Communists participated openly in the
meeting. a

On September 13, 1961, a Special Agent of the
Federal Eureau of Investigation by means of a suitable
pretext, spoke to SAM PEVZNER, who stated that he is the
public relations officer of the Committee Against Nazism
and Anti-Semitism. He stated that the organization

ee initially kriown as the Committee To Stop The Revival of

Nazism and Anti-Semitism, originated as an "ad hoc"
committee to sponsor a rally on January 26, 1960, in

New York City, to protest the rise of Nazism and anti-
Semitism. It is now a continuing organization springing
into action when the need arises.

On October 29, 1964,.a third source stated that
captioned organization is located in Room 1429, 1133
Broadway, New York City.

This third source on May 14, 1964, advised that
SAM PEVZNER was a member of the CP, USA, at that time.

' "Phe Jewish Fraternalist" dated October, 1947;

‘self identified as the official publication of the Jewish

People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) of the International Workers
Order (IWO), on page 6, contained an article which reflected
that the Emma Lazarus Division (ELD) of the JPFO was to

hold its first national convention in New York City on
November 15 and 16, 1947, after having been first established
at a National Women's Conference called three years
previously by the JPFO.

The "Morning Freiheit" on January 25, 1951,
contained a report of the National Convention of the
ELD of the JPFO which took place in New York City on
danuary 20 and 21, 1951. At this convention it was
noted that the ELD changed its name to Emma Lazarus
Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs (ELF) and adopted
a@ new constitution. : .

On May 14, 1964, a source advised that the ELF is
one of several mass organizations comprising the Jewish
cultural progressive movement. JUNE GORDON, ELF Executive
Director, who is a member of the New York State Communist
Party (CP) Board and Committee, is the leading force in
the organization, whose leadership is largely made up of
Communists.

The source stated that the ELF claims to be for
peace and interested in protecting the rights of the foreign
born, It is against the BEN GURION Government of Israel,
bomb testing, anti-Semitism, Negro discrimination, and the
rearmament of West Germany.

The source related that the ELF renders support

_ to and receives support from the "Morning Freiheit" and

other Jewish progressive organizations.

The source also stated that the ELF is recognized
by the CP, USA, as an important progressive national
organization of women. 7

The address of the national office of the ELF is

The ELF issued a Call for the Election of

Delegates to the 5th National Convention of the EV?

whichwas to be held at the George Washington Hotel,

23rd Street and Lexington Avenue, New York City, on

june 12 - 14, 1964, with a Convention banquet on

Saturday evening, June 13, 1964,

The Call stated that "103 years have passed
since the Civil War was launched in defense of.slavery.
aTederacy was defeated, but the swamps of racism, et
avery, were overlooked and side-stepped.
Untouched, tinese swamps continued to contaminate the good
earth of our democracy with an undergrowth of white supre-
macist-racist-anti-Semitic organizations - a veritable
jungle of Ultva~rightists throughout the country where
numerous Nazi war criminals, admitted to the United States,
find a climate in which Nazism can flourish.

"That we may be able to chart a course ~ as all
peace and freedom loving Americans must - to rout racism
and all its sinister, anti-democratic by-products, we call
upon all Erma Lezarus Clubs to open their pre-convention
discussions with a reading Of this Cati ard a review of their
participation in the peace and Civil Rights Movements of
their communities," is

Convention delegates were to be elected by the
clubs in May on the basis of one delegate for every ten |
paid-up members or major fraction thereof, and one alternate
delegate for each 20 members.

In May 1964, the ELF announced that the 5th
National Convention had been postponed until September 18 -
20, 1964, at the Hotel George Washington, due to the lack
of sufficient hotel space to hold the convention and
accommodate the delegates, which was caused by the large
number of tourists for the World's Fair. The election of
seunea tes for the Convention was extended until June 12,

On May 4, 1964, the ELF sent a letter to Ambassador
ANATOLY RNOERYNIN, Embassy of the USSR, Washington, D. C., in
protest to the issuance of the anti-Semitic book, "Judaism
Without Erbellishment" published by the Ukrainian Academy
of Sciences,

The letter called for the removal of the author,
Mr. KIRCHKO,in the Academy; and for an investigation of
him and all others involved in the publication to determine
if they should be placed on trial for violating the Soviet
Constitution which makes anti-Semitism a erime against the
State, The letter was concluded by stating "We rejoiced
with all other peace loving Americans when the United
States and the Soviet Union initiated and signed the
limited but historic test-ban treaty. We look forward
with you, the people of the Soviet Union, and all humanity
to the complete elimination of every vestige of bigotry
So that all mankind can enjoy peace and brotherhood.

APPENDIX

The 1943-1944 American Jewish Year Book reflects
«that the American Federation For Polish Jews (AFPJ) was
founded in 1908 for the purpose of promoting social and
cultural activities among its affiliates and guarding
* and promoting the interests of the Jews in Poland.

A source advised on May 12, 1949, and May 16,
1963, that at the convention of the AFPJ held in New York
City on March 26 and 27, 1949, a "left-wing Communist
element" was elected to direct the activities of this
organization.

On December 20, 1949, the above source reported
he had been informed by a member of the Communist Party,
United States of America (CPUSA), that the above Federation
= hasesta tad full control of the "left-wing and. progressive
elements, :

The same source stated on May 14, 1964, that the
. AFPJ continues to function from its headquarters at 1133
Broadway, Room 732, New York, New York, and is still
controlled by Communists and "left-wingers."

COMMITTEE AGAINST NAZISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM

A source advised on January 25, 1960, that a
meeting was sponsored by "The Worxer," an east coast
Communist newspaper, on January 24, 1960, at the Fark
Palace, New York City. EVELYN WIENER, described the
source as the chairman of the New York County Conmunist
Party (CP), invited the audience to attend a protest
meeting to be held in Union Square, New York City, on
January 26, 1960, to protest anti-Semitism in West Germany.

A second source on January 26, 1960, advised that
the CP had prepared 6,000 leaflets in connection with anti-
Semitism to be distributed at a rally to be held that day
at Union Square, New York City. These leaflets, according
to the source, were not distributed since the CP was not
openly represented at the meeting. However, according to
the source, known Communists participated openly in the
meeting.

On September 13, 1961, a Special Agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation by means of a suitable
pretext, spoke to SAM PEVZNER, who stated that he is the
public relations officer of the Committee Against Nazism
and Anti-Semitism, He stated that the organization
initially known as the Committee To Stop The Revival of
Nazism and Anti-Semitism, originated as an "ad hoc"
committee to sponsor a rally on January 26, 1960, in
New York City, to protest the rise of Nazism and anti-

Semitism., It is now a continuing organization springing
into action when the need arises.

On May 14, 1964, a third source stated that
captioned organization is located in Room 732, 1133
Broadway, New York City.

This third source on May 14, 1964, advised that
SAM PEVZNER was a member of the CP, USA, at that time.

prosecution, have no national name or organization.

SANDLER stated that these lodges "lived" as clubs

eivic activities, but which activities are less political
than in the former lodges. New York gave leadership to the
rest of the country since the New York lodges were the
strongest and had the more politically developed comrades.

These clubs and societies still maintain a medical
plan, funeral benefits and mutual aid funds. There are 132
clubs and societies nationally, 63 of which are iccated in
New York City.

COMMITTEE AGAINST NAZISM AND
ANTI-SEMITISM, Yormerly !micown
as the Committee To Stop ‘the
Revival of Nazism and Anti-Sena:

tisa

A source advised on January 25, 1950, that a
meeting was sponsored by "The Yorker," ah east coast
Communist newspaper, on January 24, 1950, at the Park
Palace, New York City. EVELYN WTENE! R, described by the
source as the chairman of the New York County Communist
Party (CP), invited the audience to attend a protest
meéting to be held in Union Square, New York City, on
January 26, 1950, to protest anti-Semitism in West Germany.

A second source on January 26, 1960, advised
that the CP had prepared 6,000 Leaflets in connection with
anti-Semitism to be distributed at a rally to be held that
day at Union Square, New York City. Tnese leaflets,
according to the source, were not distributed since the
CP was not openiy represented at the me . However,
according to the source, lmiotm Communists participated
openly in the meeting.

On September 13, 1951, a Special Agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation by means of a suitable
pretext, spoke to SAM PEVZNER, who stated that ne is the
public relations o: cer of the Committee Against Nazism
and Anti-Semitism. He stated that tne organization
initially known as the Committee To Stop The Revival of
Nazism and Anti-Semitism, originated as an "ad hoc"
committee to sponsor a rally on January 25, 1050, in
New York City, to protest the rise of Na mand anti-
Semitism.. It is now a continuing organization springing
into action when the nced avises.

On April 25, 1963, a third source stated that
captioned organization is iocate d in Room 722, 1.
Broadway, New York City.

This third source on May 3, 1961, advised
that SAM PEVZNER was a member of tne CP, USA, at that
time. 7

NATIONAL COMMITTEE AGAINST NAZI CRIMINALS
AND NAZISM IN AMERICA, Formerly known as
National Committee Against Nazi War Criminals
and Nazism in America, and Committee Against
Nazi Criminals and Nazism in America Hee

A source advised on February 11, 1963, that at a
meeting in Chicago on February 10, 1963, a group of former
members of the Chicago Anti-Adotph Heusinger Committee (CAAHC),
recently disbanded, together with representatives of several
other nationality groups met and formed a Committee Against
Nazi Criminals and Nazism in America, subsequently renamed the
Pacers Committee Against Nazi Criminals and Nazism in
merican,

This organiztion's headquarters is in a private
residence, It is:a-nori-membership organization and reportedly
represents some 15,600persons from various nationality groups.

Its aims and purposes are to seek out men who committed
war crimes in Europe, apprehend them,and force their return to
the countries in which their crimes were committed. The President
of this Committee is Rabbi S$, BURR YAMPOL who is anti-communist,
but would accept aid from communists if it would serve his
purpose. JACK KLING has played a leading role in the formation
of this committee and is preparing the "fact sheet" setting out
the purposes of this committee.

A second source advised between January, 1963, and
April 23, 1963, that four of the five Vice Chairmen of this
committee are Communist Party (CP) members and that in April,
1963, JACK KLING, a leading CP of Illinois District functionary,
instructed these Vice Chairmen that he did not want the committee
identified as communist, and therefore they should arrange for’
replacements to further remove the possibility of identifyhg
the committee as communists.

JEWISH CULTURAL CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
Also known as Jewish Program
Service Committee

A source advised on April 27, 1954, that the
former leaders, including GEDALIA SANDLER, Executive
Secretary, of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (TPFO),
Jewish nationality section of the International Workers
Order (IVO}) nad established a committee at 1133 Broadway,

New York, New York. Through this committee they were organizing

cultural clubs and societies based on JPFO lodges which had
been dissolved on December 15, 1953, in the course of proceed-
ings by the New York State authorities culminating in the
liquidation of the Iwo.

A second source advised on March 15, 1961, that a
meeting of the National Groups Commission of the Communist
Party, United States of America, was held on March 2, 1961,
in New York City. GEDALIA SANDLER was among those present
and spoke of his experiences in maintaining the Jewish
lodges after the dissolution of the IWO, which, to avoid
prosecution, have no national name or organization.

SANDZIER stated that these lodges "lived" as clubs
and societies by maintaining their culturel, fraternal and ~
civic activities, but which activities are less political
than in the former lodges, New York gave leadership to the
rest of the country since the New York lodges were the
strongest and had the more politically developed comrades.

These clubs and societies still maintain a medical
plan, funeral benefits and mutual aid funds. There are 132
clubs and societies nationally, 63 of which are located in
New York City.

A third source furnished infomation in May, 1963,
that the clubs and societies ave located at 1133 Broadway,
Room 1429, New York, New York, under the name of the Jewish
Program Service Committee, but are more widely mown as the
Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies.

The IWO and the JPFO have been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

SERVICE BUREAU OF JEWISH EDUCATION

Comaittee For Prosressiv

On March 12, 1953, a source made available a
pamphlet captioned "m Lons and Answers Apow’s The
Progressive Jewish Children's Senools," which states
that for more than twenty years tHe children's schools

f the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) constituted
the progressive wing of secular Jewish education.

On March 1 1°51, another source revorted that
as of January 17, co “the school system of tne JPFO was
then knovn as the Committee for Progressive Jewish Education
(CPJE), the former name being the National School and
Cultural Commission of the JPFO.

On September 14, 1955, the second source, mentioned
above, advised that on the afternoon of September 13, 1955,
the CPJE acceded to the demands of the New York State Depart-
ment of Insurance as liquidator of the International Workers
Order (IvO) that the CPJE surrender itself to the State as
an asset of the IWO. The State, on that date, took control
and closed the office of the CPJE located in Room $03, 160
Fifth Avenue, New York City.

On January 23, 1956, a third source made available
a letter of the Service Bureau. of Jewish Education (SBJE),
Room 1005, 1123 Broadway, New York City, dated Januax
1955, which reflected that although "t

to a certain
the attacks on our schools paralyzed our n
with you," the SBJE established tts own office, opened

and is serving all progressive Jewish chiidren's schools.

| The ELF issued an "Action Letter", dated October,
j 1962, for all Ani executives, which included a discussion of
i the following

1. Calendar, Jewish Book Month and 75th Anniversary
of Death of EMMA TAZARUS The létter opened with a statement
that "we look forward to a most productive and gratifying
season of activities on the crucial problems confronting our
nation, prime among them the twin issues of civil rights and
peace." The letter suggested that club programs for Jewish
Book Month, November 16 - December 16, be dedicated to a
discussion of the reprint of two EMMA LAZARUS articles, "The

* Jewish Problem" and "The Last Revolt of the Jews", in :
relation to "the rising tide of anti-Semitism stimulated by
the growth of fii€ra-Right movement."

2. ° Membership and Club Building In eee to
membership and club building; the letter stated that the toe
Midterm Board meeting had reviewed and evaluated the results
of the membership drive launched at the Fourth National
Convention in November, 1961, at which a goal was set for a
25 per cent increase in membership by June, 1962, and
50 per cent by the next convention. It stated that. per capita

there was a ten per cent increase in membership and several
new ‘clubs formed.

It was felt that good progress was made since it
was the first year in which such goals were undertaken in
an organized manner, with concentration in three areas -
Los Angeles, Detroit and Brooklyn.

The letter stated that as an experiment to reduce
the loss of new members in New York, new members were
induced to pay a year's dues and receive a gift copy of
"Emma Lazarus, Woman With a Torch.” In paying two years!
dues, the new member réceived a copy of the ERNESTINE. ~~
ROSE book. In addition, club members enrolling three new
members received a copy of the ERNESTINE ROSE book. The
experiment proved to be successful when more than 100 new
members paid up one or two years! dues and have stayed with A

their club.
3. ERNESTINE ROSE Headstone

The Convention approved project of selecting a
delegation to send to London, England, for the unveiling
of a headstone over the grave of ERNESTINE ROSE has been
amended. Instead of applying to the three larges}.districts,
Los Angeles, Chicago and Brooklyn, each district will now
have the opportunity of selecting one member as part of the
delegation if the district attains a goal of a 50 per cent
increase over and above the membership recorded at the end
of 1961 or at the time of the November, 1961 Convention.

4, Convention Fund

- The payment of $1.00 per member was due for 1962,
towards a total of $2.00 per club member before the next
convention,

5. UN Genocide Convention

A signature drive ‘on a petition for the United States
Senate ratification of the UN Genocide Convention of 1943
would be launched soon.

The clubs were requested to return the Pledge

according to JUNE GORDON, the ELF has followed a policy. of
cooperating with all peace organizations which initiate
actions, but has avoided direct involvement or affiliation
with one organization or another, in order not to become
involved in differences that arise between the various
organizations and committees in the peace movement.

GORDON stated that one of the deciding factors
4n affiliating with such an organization would be to decide
the extent the Emma Lazarus Clubs could help to involve the
Jewish community in the peace movement. The main question
is, will affiliation help to get other Jewish organizations
become affiliated.

Mrs. THELMA HAMILTON was introduced as a leader
in the Negro liberation movement and as Executive Secretary
of the Parents Workshop for Integration of Public Schools.
HAMILTON spoke of the deeds of EMMA LAZARUS in fighting
anti-Semitism.

a

HAMILTON stated that the, United.States is a great
country, but she finds it necessary to be critical, She
stated that in 1958, people were shocked to hear that a
Jewish Temple was bombed in Atlanta, Georgia. People were
shocked with the unjust treatment of Negroes in the South.
The leaders of the country spoke out against these attacks,
yet such incidents occurred again and again and in the North,
with the further desecration of synagogues and the segregation
of the Negro in housing and schools.

She emphasized that “segregation in public schools
must end if we are to make this a better world. We must
take up the cross for human dignity". If laws are to be
passed, they should be enforced. She concluded that the
women of today must follow in the footsteps of EMMA LAZARUS.
All nationalities, including the Negro and the Jew, must
stand together. np)

JUNE GORDON, ELF Executive Director, spoke of —~
the contributions of EMMA LAZARUS in_combatting anti-Semitism.

of the anti-Semitic nature of the play in the character of
Shylock, She stated that though the ELF and other organiza-
tions were unable to stop thepresentation, they succeeded
in alerting the community to the impact of such art upon

the public.

GORDON stated that an ELF delegation had visited
Congressman EMANUEL CELLER, Chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, in April, and presented him with a petition of
"15,000' signatures calling for the enactment of a statute
of limitations in Genaturalization and deportation proceedings.

She stated that crimes, with the exception of
murder, offer criminals the protection of a statute of
limitation. However, the foreign. born have no such protection.

GORDON read a letter of Congressman CELLER
acknowledging his receipt of the petition and of his
intent to present them to President JOHN F, KENNEDY.
GORDON then read a letter from the White House acknowledging
the President's interest in such legislation.

GORDON concluded her speech with an appeal to put
an end to anti-Semitism, Nazism and H-bomb testing. She
Stated nuclear war must be banished from the world. She
asked for the unity of all people to live in peace and
freedom.

At the conclusion of GORDON's speech, the
assemblage proceeded to place a wreath beneath the bronze

“One of the most important resolutions adopted at our.
4th-Tenth Anniversary Convention dealt with the McCarran Internal
Security Act and the June 5, 1961 Supreme Court decision upholding
it by a majority of ONE -- the vote was 5-4. Our resolution
took note of the fact that President Truman vetoed the Act when
it was passed in 1950.

"our resolution like those of tle National Council
of Jewish Women, the American Jewish Congress and meny other
organizations of the people including major trade unions,
denounced the McCarran Internal Security Act as an attack {
upon the very foundations of our democracy.

"In adopting this resolution we resolved to exercise
our civic duty by calling upon President Kennedy to STOP the
enforcement of this act as President Thomas Jeffer did in his
time when, backed by the people, he refused to enf e the Alien
and Sedition Acts.

pamphlet captioned, "Questions and Answers About The
Progressive Jewish Children's Schools," which states
that for more than twenty years the children's schools
of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) constituted
the progressive wing of secular Jewish education.

On March 17, 1951, another source reported that
as of January 17, 1951, the school system of the JPFO was
then known as the Committee for Progressive Jewish
Education (CPJE), the former name being the National
School and Cultural Commission of the JPFO.

On September 14, 1955, the second source, mentioned
above, advised that on the afternoon of September 13, 1955,
the CPJE acceded to the demands of the New York State Depart-
ment of Insurance as liquidator of the International Workers
Order (IWO) that the CPJE surrender itself to the State as
an asset of the IWO, The State, on that date, took control
and closed the office of the CPJE located in Room 903, 150
Fifth Avenue, New York City.

On January 23, 1956, a third source made available
a letter of the Service Bureau of Jewish Education (SBJE),
Room 1005, 1123 Broadway, New York City, dated January 19,

the attacks on our schools paralyzed our normal contact
with you," the SBIE established its own office, opened

"The Jewish Fraternalist" dated October, 1947,
self identified as the official publication of the Jewish
People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) of the International
Workers Order (IWO), on page 6, contained an article
which reflected that vhe Emma Lazarus Division (ELD) of
the JPFO was to hold its first national convention in New

. York City on November 15 and 16, 1947, after having been
first established at a National Women's Conference called
three years previously by the JPFO,

The "Morning Freiheit" on January 25, 1951,
contained a report. on the National Conveniion of the
ELD of the JPFO which took place in New York City on
January 20 and 21, 1951. At this convention it was noted
that the ELD changed its name to Emma Lazarus‘ Federation
of Jewish Women's Clubs (ELF) and adopted a new constitution.

On May 11, 1961, a source advised that the ELF is
.one of several mass organizations comprising the Jewish cultural
. progressive movement. JUNE GORDON, ELF Executive Director,
who is a member of the New York State Communist Party (CP)
Board and Committee, is the leading force in the organization,
whose leadership is largely made up of Communists.

“The source stated that the ELF claims to be for
peace and interested in protecting the rights of the foreign
born. It is against the BEN GURION Government of Israel,
bomb testing, anti-Semitism, Negro discrimination, and the
rearmament cf West Germany.

The source related that the ELF renders support
to and receives support from the "Morning Freiheit” and
‘any other Jewish progressive organizations.

The source also stated that the ELF is recognized
by the CP, USA as an important progressive national
organization of women.

JEWISH PROGRAM SERVICE COMMITTEE

‘ A source advised in April, 1954, that the former
leaders of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO),
Jewish nationality section of the International Workers
Order (IYO), had established the Jewish Publication and
Research Committee (JPRC). Through this committee they
were organizing cultural clubs and societies based on

JPFO Lodges which had been dissolved on December 15, 1953,
in the course of proceedings by the New York State
authorities culminating in the liquidation of the IWO.

The above source on April 27, 1955, advised that
New York area clubs and societies of the JPRC were divided
into four districts, Bronx, Manhattan, East Brooklyn. and
West Brooklyn, with each district having a district
coordinating committee which in turn are represented on
the General Coordinating Committee of Jewish Clubs and
' Societies (GC%).

A second source provided informetion in June,

'- 1955, reflecting that the JPRC had changed its name to

Jewish Publication and Cultural Committee (JPCC) about
that time,

The second source advised on April 16, 1956,
that the East Brooklyn Committee and West Brooklyn Committee
were unified into the Brooklyn Committee of Jewish Societies
having co-chairmen and co-secretaries of the then East and
West Brooklyn committees.

A third source on March 3, 1957, advised that
* the City Committee of Jewish Clubs is the New York delegated
body of the English speaking clubs of the New York area
elubs and societies which is represented on the GCC. The
GCC in turn gives leadership to the clubs and societies in
the New York area as well as throughout the country.

THE NEW YORK COUNCIL To
ABOLISH THE UN-AMERICAN
| ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE

: On March 9, 1961, a source advised that the New

York Council To Abolish the Un-American Activities Committee
“ (NYCAUAC), 150 West 34th Street, New York City, New York,
was formed at a meeting held in New Yor: City on November 17,
1960. This organization was founded principally through the
efforts of FRANK WILKINSON, Field Representative of the
National Committee To Abolish the Un-American Activities
Committee (NCAUAC).

A second source advised on September 17, 1952;
that FRANK WILKINSON was a Communist Party member as of
September, 1952.

: The "National Guardian" in January 16, 1961,

_ , issue, page 7, colurm 1, contained an article which states

“>. that the WYCAUAC has only one objective: "to heip the
National Committee as vigorously as possible in its
endeavors to mobilize the American people in a campaign
to abolish the House Committee on Un-American Activities."

A third source furnished on March 9, 1961, a
Prospectus of the NCAUAC prepared principally by FRANK
. WILKINSON, which in reference to "local abolition committees"
- .* stated that these committees may identify and coordinate
their efforts as closely as they desire with NCAUAC, still
maintaining their autonomy for as flexible and independent
program as possible. The prospectus aiso stated that the
NYCAUAC was responsible for coordinating abolition activities
-on the Atlantic coast. ane

Various sources have advised in April, 1961, that
Communist Party members in the New York City area have been

Solicited to support activities of the NYCAUAC during
attendance at Communist Party club meetings. .

SERVICE BUREAU OF JEWISH EDUCATION

On March 12, 1953, a source made available a
pamphlet captioned, “Questions and Answers About The
Progressive Jewish Children's Schools," which states
that for more than twenty years the children's schools of
the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) constituted the
progressive wing of secular Jewish education.

On March 17, 1951, another source reported that
as of January 17, 1951, the school system of the JPFO was
then known as the Committee for Progressive Jewish
Education (CPJE), the former name being the National
School and Cultural Commission of the JPFO.

: On September 14, 1955, the second source, mentioned
above, advised that on the afternoon of September 13, 1955,
the CPJE acceded to the demands of the New York State Depart-
ment of Insurance as liquidator of the International Workers
Order (IWO) that the CPJE surrender itself to the State as an
asset of the IWO. The State, on that date, took control and
closed the office of the CPJE located in Room 903, 160 Fifth
Avenue, New York City.

On January 23, 1956, a third source made available
a letter of the Service Bureau of Jewish Education (SBJE),

- Room 1005, 1123 Broadway, New Vork City, dated January 19,

1956, which reflected that although "to a certain extent,
the attacks on our schools paralyzed our normal contact
with you," the SBJE established its own office, opened and
is serving all progressive Jewish children's schools.

The current Borough of Manhattan (New York City)
Telephone Directory, reflects the address of the SBJE as
1123 Broadway, New York City.

The JPFO, the Jewish Nationality Section

of the IWO and the IWO have been designated
by the Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450,

work energetically with other elements which are engaged in
a campaign for an amendment to establish a limiting statute
to the Mc Carran-Walter Immigration Act." ;

AMERICAN FEDERATION FOR AID
TO POLISH JEWS

a The 1943-1944 American Jewish Year Book reflects that
the American Federation for Polish Jews (AFPJ) was founded in
1908 for the purpose of promoting social and cultural activities
among its affiliates and guarding and promoting the interests
of the Jews in Poland.

A source advised on May 12, 1949, that at the
convention of the AFPJ held in New York City on March 26,27, 1949,
the "right-wing elements" were eliminated and the "left-wing
Communist element" was elected.

On December 20, 1949, the above source reported he
had been informed by a member of the Communist Party, USA,
that the above federation was under the full control of the
"left-wing and progressive elements",

The same source stated on April 29, 1960, that the
. AFPJ continues to function from its headquarters at 1133 Broadway,
Room 732, New York, New York, and is still controlled by
Communists and "left-wingers".

The Communist Party, USA has been
designated by the Attorney General of the
United States pursuant to Executive
.Order 10450.

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE EDUCATIONAL

An amendment to the charter of the Southern

to the Southern Conference Educational Fund, Inc,., and
listed its purposes as being to improve the educational
and cultural standards of the southern people in accordance
with the highest American democratic institutions, traditions
and ideals; The amendment was dated April 26, i9he,

A confidential informant advised on June 29,
1956, that during the time the Southern Conference for
Human Welfare was in existence, Communist Party members
were members of and worked actively in the SCHW, However,
since the formation of the SCEF, Inc., rank and file
Communist Party members have not been encouraged to work in
tha SS885" ToformAwt stated that the SCE is a progressive
liberal organization which he considers a Communist Party
front organization because it has gone along with the
Communist Party on certain issues, particularly on the
racial question, and througi: the years certain Communist
Party members in the New Orleans area have been assigned
to work in the organization to further Communist Party
principles,

Informantconsiders JAMES DOMPROWSKI, the Executive
Director of the SCEF, as a Commumist Party member because
he follows Communist principles, but he is not under
Communist Party discipline. Many prominent people who are
officials and members of the organization, while liberal
in their views, are by no means Communist.

AMERICAN COUNCIL FOR WARSAW JEWS

,

On January 29, 1951, a confidential source advised
that the American Council for Warsaw Jews (ACWJ) was
originally organized in 1941, for the relief of Warwaw
Jews in Poland and other countries. In either April or
May, 1948, a meeting of all officers, except the "left-
wingers", decided that the ACW had completed its relief
work, A motion to dissolve the ACWJ was proposed at its
National Convention held on May 16, 1948, in New York
City. The motion was opposed by the "left-wingers" and
some “well meaning people" and was defeated.

The above source stated that the then President of
the ACW, SAMUEL WOHL, resigned in September, 1948, and was
followed by various other officers plus the withdrawal from
the council by 44 of 48 affiliated organizations. Of the
four remaining organizations, the source recalled that. three
were Lodges of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO).

The same confidential source stated that when he
described some of the officers as being "left-wingers", he
Gid so because they tended to follow the line of the
Communist Party, USA (CP,USA).

On May 5, 1959, another confidential source stated
that the ACWJ was still controlled by Communists and "left-
wingers", but was relatively inactive.

The JPFO and the CP,USA, have been designated by
the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

Reference is made to memorandum prepared. at
Charlotte, North Carolina, February 6, 1970, captioned.
as above.

On February 6, 1970, Lieutenant S. N. FORD,

7 _ Greensboro, North Carolina, Police Department,

7 Intelligence Unit, advised that no reports have been
received of any individual breaking inte any of the
houses that have been padlocked and causing any
destruction.

During daily contacts with Lieutenant FORD
since that time, he has advised that the situation
has remained relatively quiet, but there have been
some further evictions of AAA Realty Company tenants
in spite of the fact that the money paid by the tenants

was supposed to be put into escrow for AAA Realty
Company.

Lieutenant FORD also advised on March 9,
1970, that he had received copies of two leaflets
that had been passed out extensively in the Negro
community concerning the AAA situation. These are
as follows;

AAA REALTY TENANTS
ARE
SLOWLY BEING CRUSHED

This is to notify the entire Greensboro Community that the tenants of AAA Realty
Company are being treated in the cruelest sort of way. Little children are being
padlocked out of their houses in cold weather. The hemes of invalids are being
padlocked, Men and women are being forced to move out into the street. Te-
nants must live in fear of evictions even though they have paid their rent into
the escrow account set up by the court.

Why is all of this happening? Because Kaye Agapion of ASA Realty is refusing
to follow the court ordered injunction. Because Kaye Agapion claims that ic
tenants have not paid our rent, Because Kaye Agapion is arbitrarily demanding
payments for unexplained fees. Because the court and the sheriff's offi-> are
supporting Kaye Agapion in her cruel and unjust actions. Because the news
media is supporting Kaye Agapion and AAA Realty by printing misleading and
false articles about the strike being near sgttlement. We had to write our
own leaflet because we could not trust the news media to print the truth.

We, the tenants of AAA Realty, have tried to work with the court, but we have
only received greater persecution and harrassment from AAA Realty as a result.
Today alone, at least ten families have been padlocked out. Little children
are outside without food and clothing. ‘There are ten families with no where
to sleep in Greensboro tonight, but these people have paid their rent according
to court order. They have obeyed the law, why doesn't some one make AAA Realty
and Kaye Agapion obey the law and treat her tenants like human beings?

We have decided that the court has not and will not help us. The court has
worked to our disadvantage. We must now take things into our own hands and

seek justice for ourselves. We will not sit back and continue to have our
children and sick treated this way, We will not have any person treated this
way any longer. This notice is to inform all of the Greensboro Community of the
veal state of affairs with the strike. We urge those persons in positions of
authority to act now. We urge all Black people to join us in our fight.

WE GOT NO PROTECTION FROM ‘HE COURT.
WE Gor NO PROTECTION FROM THE SHERIFF ‘ S DEPARTMENT.

THE NEWS MEDIA REFUSED TO PRINT HONEST STORIES.

WE ARE FORCED TO FIGHT FOR OURSELVES .

On March 12, 1970, Lieutenant FORD advised that there
had been some evictions of AAA Realty tenants in the past few
days and he had learned that in at least three or four instances
Negroes had gone back to the houses that had been padlocked,
had broken off the locks, and had moved the tenants back into
the houses. AAA Realty Company had mot made any efforts to
further evict these particular tenants, but the situation was
very tense. ae

Ay, pivisa, of,
T-1 advised on March 10, 1970, that NELSON
» NAPOLEON-SSOBNSON had prepared both of the leaflets that had
been distributed in the Negro sections relative to the AAA
Realty Company. He said these had been passed out a11 over
the Negro section and that tempers were rising as far as the
AAA Realy Company was concerned.

On March 12, 1970, T-1 advised that there would be
@ mass meeting in the Negro community om Ross Avenue relative
to the strike. T~l stated that the real difficulty was that
a number of tenants claim that they had made their payments
to AAA Realty Company through the Greensboro Association of
Poor People, hut that the money they had paid had not been
credited to their account. He said at least fawor five
individuals claimed that they were all paid up in their rent
and yet were being evicted, and this was being used as an
issue by the black community generally in its opposition to
AAA Realty Company. 5 7 LC .

On March 13," ‘1970; > bieutenant st N. FORD advised
Mr. B. JV-BATILE, representative of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NS4ACP), had obtained
@ parade permit on the morning of March 13, 1970, for a
parade to be held at 6 p.m., that eveming. The purpose of
the parade was to protest AAA Realty Company and BATTLE had
told the Police Department that he estimated there would be
approximately 200 participants.

fhe permit was granted for the parade to be held
from the Negro section of Greensboro into the downtown area
of Greensboro and back to Hayes Taylor YMCA for a mass protest
meeting on the evening of March 13, 1970. Lieutenant FORD

RE: POSSIBLE RENT STRIKE SPONSORED BY GAPP, GREENSBORO,
NORTH CAROLINA

pointed out that Hayes Taylor YMCA is located immediately
adjacent to A & T State University and he felt that although

a permit had been granted for only 200 participants in this
march, there might just as easily be 2,000 if the student body
at A & T State University decided to participate. He also
pointed out that NELSON NAPOLEON JOHNSON, the Vice-President

of A & T State University student body, had been responsible
for the setting up and organizing this whole rent strike against
AAA Realty Company and if JOHNSON was so inclined, there was no
doubt that he could bring a large segment of the student body
of A & T State University off campus to participate in such a
march.

On the evening of March 13, 1970, Lieutenant §. N.
FORD advised that only 33 participants left the Hayes Taylor
YMCA carrying placards, decrying the treatment by AAA Realty
Company and marched into the downtown section. They marched
up the main street of Greensboro and then turned and headed
back to Hayes Taylor YMCA. By the time they returned to the
YMCA, 48 individuals were participating in the march.

: fit

Lieutenant FORD noted that THOMAS-BAILEY and NELSON

JOHNSON were the individuals who Were, in charge of the march
and participated in it.

After the archers returned to Hayes Taylor YMCA,
they dispersed without incident. 5
Lieutenant FORD further advised that on March 14,
1970, another march by the same group of individuals left
Hayes Taylor YMCA at 1:30 p.m. On this occasion, there were
65 individuals participating and they walked on exactly the
ame route downdown, up the main street, and then back to
layes Taylor YMCA. By the time the marchers returned to
jthe YMCA, there were 71 participants. THOMAS BAILEY and LOUIS
RANDON were in charge of this particular march and NELSON .
‘FIORNSON was-observed in the vicinity not actually participating.

Lieutenant FORD pointed out that at the end of the
march, there were individuals who had been identified as members
of the Black Panther Party when that organization was active C
in Greensboro last year. He recognized in’ the group MICHAEL >
7 AXKEN, CHARLIE CALDWELL, ROBERT-EBVANS, HAROLD “DAVIS. oe fy,

The group sang songs, clapped their hands, and
carried again the placards pointing out the treatment that had
been afforded tenants by AAA Realty Company.

According to Lieutenant FORD, the group upon returning
to Hayes Taylor YMCA stayed for just a few minutes and then
dispersed without incident.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY,
Also Known As

Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

According to its official newspaper, the Black
Panther Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in
Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can take
control of the life, politics and the destiny of the black
community. It was organized by Bobby Seale, BPP Chairman, and
Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton was sentenced
in 1968 to serve 2 to 15 years after being convicted of man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police
officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which
further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,"
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla .
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred
to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

“The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,
contains an editorial ‘by BPP Minister of Education, George
Mason Murray, which ends with the following:

‘ 5 :

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth
keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.
Dynamite: Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement "...we will not dissent from American Government.
We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that
“political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.”

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been
established at various locations throughout the United States.

and back to Hayes Taylor YMCA on the night of March 20, 1970,
Lieutenant FORD pointed out that the marchers appeared to be
more militant than they had the previous week with a number

of them making obscene gestures, giving the black power sign
and shouting black power during the march. He also noted there
were three cars patrolling the march bearing Negro males, They
stayed right along side of the marchers and were obviously
acting as marshals for the march,

No incidents occurred on the night of March 20, 1970.

Lieutenant FORD also advised on March 21, 1970,
beginning at 1:05 P.M. approximately 75 marchers again left
Hayes Taylor YMCA and marched through the downtown section
of Greensboro, North Carolina, This group, larger than any
of the previous groups, and again more militant and more

boisterous in their conduct went through the same route downtown

and then headed back to Hayes Taylor YMCA, No incidents
occurred but Lieutenant FORD stated it was obvious that tension
was building with each of these marches,

On March 22, 1970, CE T~1 advised that the group
of*rent strikers, bolstered by a number of A and T State
University students were planning another possible march on
March 25, 1970, before the students left A and T campus,

CE T-1 stated that during the march on March 20, 1970, that
the individuals driving the cars along side the marchers
each had a gun in the car and during the march on March 21,
1970, at least ten or fifteen of the 75 people actually
carried guns on them while they,were marching.

T-1 stated there was also some talk of taking over
the King Cotton Hotel which is owned by the AGAPIONs and is
occupied almost entirely by young Negroes. The AGAPIONs use
this as their office for AAA Realty Company and the group

was talking about taking:over the King Cotton Hotel and just

staying there until the AGAPIONS came around to the demands

Greensboro, North Carolina, on October 21, 1970, Signs carried
by pickets showed that in addition to the Greensboro Association
of Poor People that the Malcolm X Liberation University was also
supporting the blind black workers,

According to Lieutenant FORD, during the lunch hour
the blind black workers increased the number of the pickets
to some, forty to fifty, The signs protested alleged inequality
of wages and working conditions of black workers,

Lieutenant FORD stated no ingidents occurred and he

understood that picketing would continue everyday at lunch
time,

CE T-~1 advised on October 21, 1970, that the program
at the Industries of the Blind is a brain child of THOMAS BAILEY, .

blacks are being discriminated against, and he doubts if the
pickets will receive any support since BAILEY does not have a
true basis for these alleged complaints,

On December, 4, 1969, a source advised that Malcolm X
Liberation University (MXLU) was incorporated in North Carolina
during June of 1969, as a non-sectarian institution of learning
to be located at Durham, North Carolina, and was dedicated
October 25, 1969. It was announced at the dedication that the
school would open with approximately fifty students. HOWARD LAMAR
FULLER, a well-publicized Negro militant, was identified as the
Director with the title of "Head Nigger in Charge” (HNIC). A
revolutionary curriculum of sation building to develop the concept i
of Pan-Africanism with primary loyalty to black people is followed.
The source reported that students at MXLU are interviewed prior to :
admission and questions asked include some referring to their !
willingness to take firearms practice and to use this skill to kill .
white people if necessary. The source stated MXLU is to train young i
blacks to take over U, S, institutions. :

On April 6, 1970, ARCH FOSTER, JR., who is described as an
associate of HOWARD LAMAR FULLER, described Pan-Africanism, as
advocated by HOWARD LAMAR FULLER, aS a movement to have all black
people in an, alliance. Under the Pan-African type of thinking, the
black man’s first alliance would be to his fellow black people,
regardless of the nation in which he lives.

On August 28, 1976, FULLER publicly announced MXLU has
moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, for the openitig of the 1970-71
school year, October 5, 1970, with from forty to seventy students;

For the past week 40 Black Blind

The workers are picketing to pro-

$1.60/hr. and the inadequate job de-
scription; (2) poor working conditions;
(3) the lack of seniority and adequate

Thus far the white newspapers and television stations have not covered the
story very widely.in an attemmt to keep Black people from finding out about the
Industry's treatment of our people. These Black people need your assistance to
help them get justice on their jobs. Eventhough they are handicapped, they do
more than a full day's work each day. Yet they donot receive adequate wages and
they must work amid dust, trask, and rubbage daily. Despite the poor working con-
ditions at the Skileraft plant, the only first aid available is a small wooden
box containing only a few band-aids and alcohol. .

. _, Until they decided to picket the workers had tried to get redress to their
grievances through the Employees’ Grievance Committee, by writing letters to the
Board members of the Industry, and by appealing to city, state and federal offi-
Cials, They had no other choice but to openly demonstrate their discontent.
eThey:are- depending on the Black community to stand with them in their fight
, to get justice, Don't let your Brothers and Sisters down, Here's what you can
* do to help thom:
1, Sigg the petition calling for an investigation of the Skilcraft
Corporation. The petitions wili be at churches, at the mass meet-
ing and at the GAPP office, 914 1/2 Gorrell Street, 275-8588."

2. Call the Board Members of the Industry and tell them you are dis-

On October 28, 1970, Lieutenant FORD stated that
on the previous night a meeting was held at Hayes Taylor
YMCA concerning a possible strike to be called by the black
workers at the Industries of the Blind.

On the morning of October 28, 1970, according to
Lieutenant FORD, about thirty-five to forty of the black
workers had walked out of the Industries of the Blind.
Lieutenant FORD said there had been no violence of any kind
connected with this strike thus far, but with leadership by
THOMAS BAILEY, LEWIS BRANDON, and DOT JOHNSON, he feared 7
that the potential for trouble was always present.

BLACK STUDENT UNION - UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS

’
In April, 1970, Confidential Source LV T~1 advised
the Federal Bureau of Investigation that BLACK STUDENT UNION
(BSU), UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS (UNLV) had decided to
tighten security and make the records of the organization un-
,available to unauthorizeg~people. The immediate reason for this
“action was that CIA ati ttclte an instructor in the Black Studies
Program (BSP), paar “ayScovered by members of BSU making copies
of records which, at that time were. readily available. The reason
CAMPBELL was copying the records has not been made clear.

Ly T-1 stated the staff of the BSP, UNLV, which'was
instrumental in re-activating BSU, UNLV, has divided into two
factions of differing opinions regarding BSU operations. AS a
result the membership of BSU, UNLV has split along factional lines
and has suffered a large membership loss.

The factional split is believed to be the reason
CAMPBELL was interested in the paper records of the organization.

yOnon’

copies of-all papers, membership records and plans destroyed. One
copy of each record is maintained by the Chairman.

The Chairman.of the BSU, UNLV, -MICHAE

LV T-1 further advised the plans of action of the BSU,
UNLV consisted merely of organizational plans and plans pertaining
to political action on campus.

LV T-1 advised that due to a lack of funds BSU, UNLV has
been unable to follow through on plans to purchase radio receivers
to monitor and follow police calls in the Negro areas of Las Vegas.
The purpose of this plan was to insure that black citizens were not
going to become victims of police brutality or other mistreatment by
police officers.

On May 1, 1970, Confidential Source LV T-2 advised that
representatives of BSU, UNLV have attended organizational meetings
of a coalition of "liberal" elements in the Las Vegas community
and at the University.

On April 29, 1970, LV,T-1_stated that BSU, UNLV would send

Black Student Union,
University of Nevada,
Las Vegas, Nevada
(BSU, UNLV)

On December 12, 1968, a confidential informant,
Lv T-1, advised that an embryo BSU was being formed on the
campus of UNLV at that time. The organization had not as
yet sought the approval of the Student Senate or of the
University Administration.

The March 14, 1969, issue of the "Rebel Yell",
the UNLV student newspaper, published weekly, contained an
article which stated BSU was formed on the UNLV campus on
Wednesday, February 26, 1969. The article stated that
membership of BSU will be solely black students, whites
may attend meetings and social functions by .invitation only
from one of the members.

Some of .the defined goals of the BSU were set
out as the establishing of Black pride. and identity in the
students and the Black community; abolishing the myth that
Black clubs mean violence; the disbanding of the rigid Black
systam class that exists in the university. The article
stated, "In short, the goal of the club is 'Black Brothers
Stick Together’.

The article continued that BSU, UNLV, is planning
the developmant of a Black Studies Program with courses in
Black History being determined by the community. The BSU
planned to form a tutorial program and an academic committee
to be chaired by mussel -flarvey a BSU member. The purpose
of this committee is té help Black students who are deficient in
‘particular academic studies and to compare differences of grade
averages between black and white students.

nor conclusions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The article indicated that in conjunction with
the development of the BSU, a new Black fraternity, to be
known as Kappa Alpha Psi, will also be formed. The fraternity
will be made up primarily of Black students, but will not
exclude white students who may wish to pledge.

On March 13, 1969, BSU, UNLV, released the follow-~
ing goals or demands which were published in the university
newspaper: i

1. Black Studies Program

A Black dean
A completely autonomous college

Purpose: ‘In this academic institution there

On May 8, 1969, confidential informant LV T-2,
made available a copy of a "Resolution on Joint Committee",
made by the Student Senate of the Confederated. Students of
the University of Nevada fesum) . The Resolution is as
follows;

‘Whereas the CSUN Senate has expressed its
endorsement of a Minority Studies program, and
. Whereas the Senate has no Negro Senator to represent the
views of Black Students, and
Whereas the lack of communication between peoples often
promotes misunderstanding and impedes progress in the
formation of new programs, then

Let it be resolved that: The CSUN senate offers its services
and facilities in the form of a Joint’Committee on Minority
Studies comprised of Senators and members of Black Student
Union, should they so desire."

The Resolution, according to the source, came
about as a result of an announcement by Dr. Donald H. Baepler,
Vice President in Charge of Academic Affairs, UNLV, to the
effect that a "Black Studies Program'', will be made part
of the 1969-1970 school year curriculum at UNLV.

Confidential informant LV T-1 on May 23, 1969,
advised that the "Black Studies Program" will consist of
four courses which have been loosely identified as follows:

2. Studies in Black America
3. Problems of the Black

was undoubtedly responsible in large number for the Black Studies

National Negro Commission, CP, USA

NY T-1 on June 26, 1962, advised. that the
National Negro Commission of the CF, USA met on June
22, 1962, in New York City. CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT.' gave the
report and stated "Comrades, there are three trends in
Negro life today, King's Movement (Kev. MARTIN LUTHER
KING), the Williams Movement (ROBERT WILLIAMS, former
president, Monroe, North Carolina NAACP branch), and
the Muslim Movement. i

"The King Movement is the movement Negroes
have rallied around and we support this movement.
However, the Robert Williams Movement we reject, be-
cause its dangerous and we as Marxists are firmly
convinced that Negroes can win equal rights through
constitutional, methods in this country. Therefore,
the Negro people will not accept Robert Williams and
the NAACP was correct in ousting him.

"The Muslim Movement we reject some of their
principles. We do not believe in the separationist
theory. However, the Muslims are growing numerically
because they offer some program in economy and are
especially attractive to Negro youth.

"Yes, there's another trend in this country
in Negro life and that is ea the Marxist trend.

"One will ask eyeeie why has the Communist
Party lost its ties with the Negro community?

"I'll say the Negro people did not leave us,
we left them. We cannot continue to live on past
laurels. We must begin to rebuild the | Party among
the Negro people.

"We cannot say this is a hard task. ‘The
Negro may have cleaned us from its ranks because
leaders wanted to clear themselves with the ruling
class, just as the labor movement has done, but they
found out that this anti-Communist action has been a
burden rather than an aid and they now realize it.
Despite ROY WILKINS (Executive Secretary, NAACP), and the
NAACP cleaning. out all Communists from its ranks, the
State laws in many southern towns have been established,
ordering the NAACP to register its membership.

its

‘We must begin'a recruiting drive for Negroes
in every Gistrict. We must have a program that will
attract and interest the Negro people. Part of the
program must be:

"1, Aid, to increase Negro vote in the South.
2. Labor to organize Negroes in the South.

3. Demand the federal Government to take a
more liberal attitude towards civil rignts.

6. Demand that an executive order be

"We must have a program of direction to the
‘Negro people as objectives in the coming elections.
The Negro people have the balance of vote in 31 key
areas in the North. We should press for the correct
use of this vote. The Negro people should work to
oust reactionary candidates.

"On the question of building the Party in
the Negro community. You know Comrades there's a grave
danger existing today in the tendency of saying we
can't build the Party. This is untrue. The new trends
and currents existing today in Negro life and in the
world make it possible for us to build our Parti. We
must stop sitting on our hands. Time is ripe and I
am confident we are going to again have a large Negro
membership."

It is reflected in this report that to al
membership in the NAACP at the end of 1961 reached
380,134, a slight decline from the 388,331 enrolled
in 1960. The decline reflected the impact of the
economic recession in such industrial areas as "-
Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. In
the turbulent Southeast, there was a--slight increase
in membership.

Despite widespread unemployment among Negro
industrial workers, whose rate of joblessness was two-
and-a-half times that of white workers, the Associa-
tion's money income from all sources remained about
the same, passing, for the fourth successive year,
the million-dollar mark.

During 1961 total paid memberships in the
Association amounted to 380,134. Of this number
370,444 were enrolled in the Association's 1,494 local
branches, youth councils and college chapters in &
states. The remainder consisted of annual and life
members-at-large. There were units of the Association
in every state except Alabama, from which the NAACP
has been barred by state injunction since 1956, and
Vermont, where the Negro population is minimal.

The Association's total paid membership for
the year was from the following sources: :

Branch Memberships 348,932
Memberships Reported by Youth Groups. 21,512
Life Memberships Fully Paid 2,512

COMMITTEE TO AID THE MONROE DEFENDANTS

?

A source advised on May 10, 1962, that the
Committee to Aid the Monroe Defendants (CAMD) was formed
during September, 1961, by the Socialist Workers Party
(Swe) in New York City. The SWP originally proposed the.
formation of this committee during discussions with various
left-wing and liberal tendencies and offered a sum of money —
to initiate activities.

Source advised that the SWP, however, was un-
successful in forming a committee of various tendencies
and proceeded to organize the CAMD and promote its activities’
under the domination and control of the SWP.

Source advised that the aims of the CAMD are to
afford financial support and consel for ROBERT F, WILLIAMS
and four other defendants who were involved in a racial
incident on August 27, 1961, at Monroe, North Carolina.

The SWP nopes to dramatize this incident nationally and
internationally through the CAMD and thus attract individuals
to the SWP aims and principles by playing a leading role in
the integration struggle.

The organization and impetus of CAMD activities
throughout the various parts of the United States such as
. obtaining sponsors and the raising of funds, are the results
of the efforts of various SWP vranches.

Source advised that the headquarters of the CAMD
are located in Suite 117, 141 Broadway, New York, New York,
however, all CAMD office work is actually carried on at
SWP headquarters, 1165 University Place, New York City.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
Soret of the United States pursuant to Executive Order
10450.

Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) and other unions in the
American Federation of Labor ~ Congress of Industrial
Organizations (AFL-CIO).

NY T-1 on November 11, 1962, advised that
at the last session of the NALC convention held
November 11, 1962, the convention delegates approved
a proposal that the NALC would endorse the NAACP in
their charges of racial discrimination against the ILGWU.
The proposal, however, did not endorse the NAACP in
its position that all local unions in the ILGWU guilty
of job and membership discrimination should be subject
to decertification as a member union of the AFL-CIO.

"The Worker", an east coast Communist
newspaper, issue of December 20, 1959,
reported that CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT at a meeting
of the National Committee, CP, USA, on
December 14, 1959, was elected Vice Chairman
of the CP, USA. E

NY T-2 on January 8, 1962, advised that the
State Board, CP of Illinois, also known as
the Coordinating Committee, is the highest
governing body of the Illinois CP. CLAUDE
LIGHTFOOT is a member of this Board.

NY T-3 advised in February, 1963, that a meeting
of leading functionaries of the CP, USA was held in
New York City on February 11, 1963.

JACK STACHEL spoke on the topic "The Growing
Militance and Successful Struggles of the Negro People".
The substance of his remarks on this topic were as follows:

"The Negro people will no longer accept any
substitute for their full citizenship and equality.
They have declared uncompromising war or struggle, not

par ae



NY 100-7629

"only against their own fanatics but also against all
attempts towards tokenism and gradualism. The Negro
people,themselves, in their battle for equality,
wholeheartedly accept the support of all Americans who
stand for application of the Constitution and love for
all the people. They realize the inter-connection of
the struggle of the Negro people for their own just
demands and the struggle of all Americans for peace,
democracy and social progress.

"Negro workers, with a few exceptions, are
denied skilled jobs. There is the undisputed and
shameful fact that even where the Negro workers are
employed and are members of a union, they are denied
the right to occupy postsof leadership in proportion
to their members and ability. Obviously, the trade
unions, themselves, have not succeeded in accomplishing
the program of equal rights for the Negro people.

"The majority of the members ofthe House and
Senate are anti-labor and the Kennedy Administration
represents big business.

"A joint struggle by the Negroes and Labor
within the trade unions, themselves, and in Congress,
for equal rights for the Negro people everywhere will
help defeat new anti-labor legislation now being proposed.
That is why the Communist Party fully supports all
those proposals by the NALC, the NAACP, and other Negro
people's organizations for utilizing every and all
methods, including existing laws, to compel all
institutions, including the trade unions, to grant full
and equal rights to the Negro workers.

"We consider the above policy as a principal
guide for all Communists and we hope it will become
the guide for all trade unionists."

elected to the National Coinmittee of the
CP, USA at its 17th National Convention
held December 10 - 13, 1959.

NY T-12 advised in March, 1963, that a meeting
of the CP Caucus within the NAACP and members of the
CP, USA National Negro Commission was held during March, 1963,
in“, New York City for the purpose of formulating CP
strategy within the NAACP.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS gave the main report on
how this full citizenship for the Negro can be obtained
and urged that a national convention or conference be
held which would bring together all Negro organizations.
DAVIS also stated that legal victories by the NAACP have
been most decisive in the Negro liberation struggle and
the potential for further victories is by no means
exhausted, The branch of government that has been most
sensitive to the problems of the Negro people has been
the Judiciary. Therefore, it has been through the courts
that the most significant strides have been made in
the Negro liberation struggle.

: DAVIS stated that a time limit must be put on
the Jim Crow System in the United States. The Supreme
Court's formula of all deliberate speed as enunciated

in the 1954 decision has just not worked. DAVIS offered
the following proposals as possible resolutions at the
1963 NAACP NationaleConvention:

1, That the NAACP go back to the Supreme
Court and ask for a more specific deadline.

2. A resolution asking President KENNEDY for
his plan to enforce the Supreme Court's decision.

‘fy, was regarded as a heré at this o tTLON. —e
WILKINS, the main spokesman for the NAACP and
utive Secretary, praised BEN DAVIS many. times and
sought his advice. ALLAN stated that the youth of the.
NAACP, so-called "Commandoes" are under CP influence and
~ look to the CP for leadership. ALLAN stressed that the
NAACP is "our" kind of organization because it is not
exclusively Negro and the CP has a possibility of working
' in this group in their ow manner. He also stated that
‘ the CP insists. that the March on Washington must take
place on August 28, 1963. He urged the members of the
club to parbicipsse and to go there personally and to
prod Negro leaders fot to give in, but to insist that
this march be held. The CP wants this march as some kind
of measure of its: own influence among the Negro people. a

EArt URHAM gave a report dealing with the WL
NAACP conventidn held in Chicago, July 1-6, 1963. He
Bvated that two major ideological problems were before abe
the convention. One was, whether mass direct action waste
the order of business of the NAACP and secondly whether ~~
it was correct to have a mass demonstration in Washington,
D.C., in support of the Kennedy civil rights package. These
two questions, DURHAM indicated, were decided very early
in the convention and decided in a positive manner.

NY 100-7629 —

DURHAM stated the NAACP convention enhanced

- the position of the NAACP in the Negro peoples movement.

Both the decision of the convention and the temper of the
delegates of the convention makes this convention the’ most
militant almost since its birth, The NAACP is still not
alone in the civil rights battle bu’ it still can be

the wnifying force in this struggle. There is stilla.

NY T-5 on August 2, 1963, advised that the ,

SWP convention was held in New York City July 18-21, 1963.
A resolution on the "Negro Question" was adopted. This,

rather the sharp and massive demends for immediate and
full equality. The resolution also describes the leading

. Negro groups which includes the NAACP.

The Party plan of action is one of "behind the

group or trend over ,another but rather to support all |
groups until the Negro masses decide which typeof group or

! NAACP
Annual Meeting

"The Crisis," official organ of the NAACP,
issue of February, i964, contains information concerning
NAACP highlights for the year 1963. ‘The following are
excerpts from the article:

7 Id:32989572 -Page 964-7



NY 100-7629

"Its in the record books now. 1963 was the
best year in the 54-year history of our NAACP.

“our Executive Secretary, Roy Wilkins, reported
| to the annual meeting, January!6, that paid memberships
| - Shot past thehalf-million mark ‘for the first time in our
history. The most astonishing gains were made in youth
| memberships, which were increased by a whopping 47
percent over 1962.

“Complete tabulations were not in at press
time; however, as of December 24, Mr. Wilkins reported
the membership figures to be 426,361 adult members of
branches, 55,867 youth members, 10,562 life members and
8,026 members-at~large. This comes to a grand total
of 515,396.

"While New York with its 12 branches in the
five boroughs enrolled some 34,011 persons, Chicago beat
out Detroit for largest single branch honors. The Windy
City turned in 31,690 memberships; the Motor City, 28,443.

"Qther branches topping the 10,000.mark were
Philadelphia, 24,481; Cleveland, 16,034; Baltimore, 12,613;
wot aoee D.C., 11,205; Pittsburgh, 10,457 and Brooklyn,

» 200,

“General income reached an all-time high, too,
with $1,513,653. Nearly 83 percent of that sum came
from the branches in one form or another.

"Incidentally, the branches really did a bang-up
job on their 1963 Freedom Fund contributions, also. The
complete figures are not in yet, but as of the end of the
560. the FFF contributions were hovering around the

260,000 mark, with indications it might reach $300,000.
Leading the pack was the Philadelphia Branch with the
largest sum put in the pot in 1963, giving $9,000.

"Although we had a great year, the fight we
waged made it a costly one. Not counting the cold,
hard, $270,000 in cash that we have tied up in bail
bonds ($250,000 of that in Mississippi, alone), 1963
operating expenses amounted to $1,527,976.

"This means we went into the red for $14,323.
Add to that certain allocations, such as matching ‘per
eapita state conference taxes, we ended up with
$62,493 in the loss column. .

"Besides breaking the 1963 record for paid .
memberships, do you know what else is on the docket for
19642 It is VOTER REGISTRATION!

"Increased voter registration activity is a

_ must this year, so get busy. At the annual meeting, Mr.

Wilkins revealed that the NAACP was responsible for
putting more than 83,000 new voters on the rolls in the
southern states alone.

"In 1964, however, Mr. Wilkins says, we must
increase that number many times over, in both the South
and the North. The Secretary reminded those who attended
the annual meeting, 'This is a political year...
Congress is playing politics with the civil rights bill
now. Our turn to play politics will come next November. '!

"Although this year heavy stress will be on
voter registration, Mr. Wilkins says no phase of the
eivil rights program will be neglected. The Association
will push for accelerated desegregation of public schools,
will campaign for more and better jobs for Negroes, and
will continue to attack discrimination in housing.

"Gloster B. Current, director of branches,
reports that a new trend seems to be evolving in NAACP
memberships. Mr. Current says more white people are
becoming active in NAACP units.

"Some of our white members have been helped
to organize new NAACP units, Mr. Current revealed.
Three predominantly white units were among the 120
that were chartered last year. In fact, charters for
the three -- Martha's Vineyard, Mass., Branch and
Youth Council, and Tri-City, Texas, Branch -- were
approved at the Board of Directors meeting which followed
the annual meeting.

"National Life Membership Chairman Kivie
Kaplan was instrumental in the organization of the
two Massachusetts units.

"Other NAACP units chartered at the January
meeting were branches in Plant City and Apopka, Fla.;
Georgetown, S.C.3; Port Norris, N.Jd.3; Perry County, I1l.3;
Dos Palos and Merced County, Calif.; and eee
County, W. Va.

“The new youth councils are Denison, Texas;
Winnsboro, S,C.; and Jones County, N.C.; with a college
chapter at Fort Valley State College, Ga."

and continues to be involved in activities of a sub-
versive nature, they do not consider him to be

to have his name exposed to the limelight regardless
of the cost, provided he receives some sort of notoriety

that CRANE derives great personal satisfaction from his
actions which, in turn, does not distract from his ego.

CHICAGO COMMITTEE TO DEFEND
THE BILL OF RIGHTS

The Chicago Committee to Defend the Bill of
Rights (CCDBR) maintains headquarters in Sulte 424, 431
South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois.

A source advised in July, 1960, that RICHARD
CRILEY, a member of the Civil Liberties Commission,
Communist Party (CP) of Illinois, met with key leaders of
the CP of Illinois and discussed with them the fact that
the climate in the United States on civil liberties and civil
rights issues had changed to the extent that it was now
possible to proceed to form a new organization with broad
mass support. By doing so, CRILEY believed that people who
would not associate themselves with an organization of
narrow scope would join a civil liberties and civil rights
organization built around a broader issue such as the
abolishment of the House Committee on ta-American Activities
(HCUA). The CP leaders, after receiving assurance from
CRILEY that any new organization that might evolve would
protect the Party interests, authorized CRILEY to proceed
with his plan to form a broader organization.

A second source advised on October 31, 1960,
that a new organization known as the Chicago Committee
to Defend the Bill of Rights was formally launched in |
Chicago at a meeting on October 26, 1960. The stated
primary purpose of the new organization was to seek the
abolition of the HOUA, and RICHARD CRILEY was nemed as
its Executive Secretary, after having been the guiding
force in arranging the October 26, 1960, meeting.

The first source in October, 1960, advised.
that CRILEY again attended a meeting of the Illinois
District CP leadership on October 23, 1960, at which
time he reported on the organizational meeting of the
CCDBR. CRILEY stated that the immediate purpose of
his organizetion is to obtain mass support to abolish
the HCUA, but the new Committee purposes will als
include defense of Smith Act and Taft-Hartley victims.
He said there will be no formal affiliation with any
national organization of similar purpose; however, the

outlined by CRILEY.

A third source advised on May 10, 1963,
that the CCDBR continues to adhere to the same aims

NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO REPEAL

THE MC _CARRAN ACT (1963)

The National Committee to Repeal the Mc Carran
Act (NCRMA) maintains headquarters in Room 318, 431
South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois.

A source advised in May, 1963, that the NCRMA
is the outgrowth of an Ad Hoc Committee of Initiators,
headed by Professor CLYDE MILLER of New York, who
Solicited signatures to a Petition to the President of the
United States in 1962 which called for the repeal of the
Mc Carran Act. The NCRMA held its formation meeting at
Chicago on May 18, 1963; the stated purpose of the
Committee is to seek repeal of the Internal Security Act
of 1950 as amended. As of July, 1963, its purpose is the
same.

Source advised that the Chicago Committee to Defend
the Bill of Rights (CCDBR), and its Executive Secretary
RICHARD CRILEY, gave full support to organizing this new
organization. At the May 18, 1963, formation meeting,
Reverend WILLIAM T. BATRD, Executive Director of the CCDBR,
was named National Administrator of the NORMA.

A second source advised in April and May, 1963,
that the Communist Party, United States of America (CP, USA)
interest in NCRMA has been to give it full support and
approval and it takes the position that the Committee
composition must be extremely broad and the Party's direct
influence must be kept to a minimum. The CP believes the
new Committee will serve its purpose in fighting the
Me Carran Act alone and the CP has everything to gain by
taking this position. The CP reportedly has agreed to make
funds available tc this Committee. .

A third source advised as of May, 1963, that
RICHARD CRILEY was then a member of the CP.

were adopted by the NYCAHUAC. One such resolution affirmed
the intention to continue to work for the abolition of the
House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) and to
continue its efforts to broaden the participation in this
fight. Another resolution accepted as a modus vivendi the
ield Representative of the "National

Records in the office of the Clerk of New York
State Supreme Court, Foley Square, New York, reflect that
The Physicians! Forum, Inc. (PF) was issued a Certificate
of Incorporation on April 27, 1944, under the laws of the
State of New York, to operate as a non-profit, membership
organization principally in the United States. The PF,
under the name of tae New York Physicians! Forum, had
been in existence as an unincorporated association since
about 1939.

A source, on September 13, 1954, furnished a
folder of PF entitled "What is the Physicians! Forum?"
which stated in part that to maintain freedom of thought
and expression in medicine, the Forum opposes the imposition
of "loyalty oaths" as a prerequisite for licensure, for
hospital appointments or privileges, in medical schools,
on hospital staffs and against patients; to re-establish
the freedom of the medical press, the Forum urges medical
Society publications to open their volumes to diverse
views on controversial subjects; and to provide a forum
wherein socially liberal doctors may express their views
in opposition to the.policies of organized medicine.

The report of the Sub-Committee to Investigate
the Administration of the Internal Security Act and other
Security Laws of the Committee of the Judiciary, United

of BELLA DODD, member of the National Committee of the
Communist Party from 1944 to 1948, DODD testified that
the PF was establisned primarily by theCommunist Party
(CP) and although not all members of the PF were Communists,
the "initiative for organising the PF came from the CP,
came from the ninth floor (35 East 12th Street, New York

On April 24, 1963, the above source advised that
the PF is opposed to the resumption of nuclear testing and
is against compulsory membership for physicians in the

"The Southern Patriot" was cited as an “organ"
of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW) by
the Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report
592, on the SCHW, June 12, 1947.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW
changed the name of that organization to the SCEF, and
listed its purpose as being to improve the educational
and cultural standards of the Southern people in
accordance with the highest American democratic
institutions, traditions, and ideals. The amendment
was dated April 26, 1946.

A source advised. on March 2, 1961, the CLAUDE
LIGHTFOOT, a Communist Party (CP) functionary, stated
at a meeting of the CP in Baltimore, Maryland, on
February 25, 1961, that the CP is not connected with
any progressive movement but indirectly they do have some
influence in the SOEF,

A second scurce, who is familiar with some
phases of CP activity in the New Orleans area, advised
on May 27, 1963, that during the time the SCHW was in
existence, CP members were members of and worked actively
in the SCHW. However, since the formation of the SCEF,
rank and file CP members have not been encouraged to
work in the SCEF, The source stated that the SCEF is
@ progressive, liberal organization, which he considers
a CP front organization because it has gone along with
the CP on certain issues, particularly on the racial
question.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

: The May, 1960, issue of the "Young Socialist"
(YS), page 1, column’ 3, disclosed that during April 15-
17, 1960, a national organization entitled "The Young
Socialist Alliance" (YSA), was established at Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. This issue stated that this organization
was formed by the nationwide supporter clubs of the
publication YS,

The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding
Declaration of YSA, This ceclaration stated that the YSA
recognizes the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only
existing political leadership on class struggle principles,
and that the supporters of the YS have come into basic
political solldarity with the SWP on the principles of
revolutionary socialism,

A source advised on Mcy 6, 1963, that the
original YSA was an organization formed during October,
1957, in New York City by youth of various left socialist
tendencies, particularly mewbers follovers of the SWP,.
The leaders of this: group were the cu
establishment of the national organi

The source further advised on May 6, 1963, that
the YSA is dominated and controlled on a national basis
by the SWP through having SWP members comprise exclusively
the National Executive Committee (NEC) and through an
official SWP representative at all YSA NEC meetings.

The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training section _
of the SWP and the main source of new SWP members.

The headquarters of the Young Socialist Alliance
are located at 125 Fourth Avenue, New York City.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450, :

“A meeting of the National CP Negro
Commission was held on February 22, 1964, at
306 East 43rd Street, Chicago, Illinois. At
this meeting, BEN DAVIS of New York gave the
main report. He stated that the Party will

In this. connection, DAVIS stated
that the NAACP was not prepared to take steps
in projecting themselves into the mainstream
of the civil rights struggle. :

‘DAVIS stated that the revolution

»in the North has taken a national pattern on
issues around jobs, school desegregation,
housing, et cetera. He stated that in New
York there has been considerable interest
around the minimum wage law. DAVIS stated
that the Negro people played a main role in
the school situation in New York along with
the assistance of Puerto Ricans and liberal
progressive forces.

CP Attempts to Infiltrate
NAACP Convention

On April 26, 1964, a CP Subcommittee
meeting on the NAACP affairs, which was open
to some non-Party members, was held at the
Chelsea Hotel, New York City. ‘The purpose of

3-

NW 55136 Docld:32989572 Page 1028



NY 100-7629

this meeting was to formulate plans. for the
forthcoming NAACP Convention to be held in
Washington, D.C., June 22 = 29, 1964, and to
analyze the role of the CP in connection
with the civil rights struggle of the NAACP.

. The meeting was opened by LESTER
DAVIS, who stated that the problems facing
the Party today in connection with the civil
rights struggle and the NAACP are twofold;
Namely, to plan on the tactics and program

to be utilized in connection with the forth-
coming NAACP Conventign in Washington, D.C.,
and to evaluate the role co“ the NAACP in the
current civil rights struggle. He pointed
out that many people have taken negative atti-
tudes toward the fole of the NAACP indicating
that they are not militant enough and are not
taking a direct action approach to this civil
rights struggle. At this time, the floor was
opened for viewpoints on the extent of the
role of the NAACP in connection with the civil
rights struggle and whether the Party should
continue its work within the NAACP or should
direct its activity to other organizations
who are more militant in their approach to
the civil rights problem,

TOBNNSILVERBERG stated that status Abe
must be maintained within the NAACP, but we
must also seek ways of channelizing our
activities elsewhere in the civil rights .
struggle. He stated that we must not abandon
other civil rights organizations who are
active in the civil rights struggle.

leadership to the membership of the NAACP.
She pointed out that. the current leadership
is not the organization but we must continue
to give leadership to the membership of the
NAACP. She stated that generally speaking,
“the current Negro leadership in the civil
rights movement does not know Bienes atis
going. .

—

WILLIAM D> Xbarrarson also stated
that the leadership of the NAACP is not the
NAACP itself. He stated that the struggle on

_ the civil rights issue is not simple but there
is no justification for abandoing the NAACP.
He stated that there was never a greater need
for Party people to bé active in connection
with the civil rights struggle of the NAACP.
PATTERSON went on to state that-the CP by
abandoning the NAACP would not break up the
NAACP but it would simply permit the current
guiding forces to do as they wish“in connection
with the Negro problem. PATTERSON went on to

- State that we must continue our effort to
bring about unity of the Negro people now.

He pointed out various vehicles that could be
used in furthering the civil rights struggle
and mentioned specifically that we should use
to advantage in connection with the civil
rights struggle the United Auto Workers civil
rights resolution which links the plight of
Negroes to the poverty struggle. PATTERSON
also drew attention to the resolutionsof an
organization named, Women Strike for Peace,
which links the Negro question to the struggle
for peace. He stated that we must find ways of
utilizing these resolutions at the National
Convention in Washington to further the
struggle for'civil rights of the Negro people.

OLIVER MARTIN stated that it would
be a mistake to pull out of the NAACP. He
stated, however, that the current NAACP leader-
ship is scared and are not taking chances. He
added this current leadership was pushed into
a direct action program by the Student Non-
‘Violent Coordinating Committee and they are
now trying to retreat from this direct action
approach, MARTIN also stated that he felt
‘padly that he did not know earlier about this
meeting as he may have been able to determine
the national program planned for the conven-
tion in Washington;.D,, and this program
could be used in formulating tactics at this
“ convention.

agreed with the remarks of WILLIAM L. .PATTERSON—

and also added that we cannot consider pulling
out of the NAACES

TEDA BASSETT pointed out that there
have been many attempts to follow up the
August 28, 1963, ,March on Washington by many
forces, but SOR MEINS. Executive.Secretary,
NAACR, stepped ‘in and prevented any further
direct action programs. BASSETT then stated
that the following items must be considered in
connection with the NAACP convention:

1. Possibility of changing the
- leadership of the NAACP at the convention even
though such leadership is not elected at the
convention,

2. Propose activity in conjunction

- with the civil rights bill now pending in
Congress even though many Congressmen have stated

Docld:32989572 Page 1031

-



NY 100-7629

‘ that such activity or demonstrations will not
influence their vote in connection with this
matter. There must be demonstrative action
in connection with this bill.

CAROLINE BALLIN stated that there
“is no format at the convention permitting change
in the NAACP leadership, however, we should
express sentiment to indicate that-a change
‘in leadership is necessary.

JOHN SILVERBERG stated that he felt
the national officers.of the NAACP have re-
treated to the traditional role of striving

‘for legal action as opposed to direct action
in connection with the civil rights issue. -

WILLIAM L, PATTERSON emphasized the —
need of utilizing pronouncements by white
individuals and organizations in advancement
of the civil rights struggle. He stated that
from numerous organizations and individuals
statements and resolutions have been proposed
.favoring the’ civil rights problem and we should
hail these programs and call on organizations
requesting them to fulfill their statements
ee action.

The following proposals were made
as possible resolutions at the NAACP Convention
tone held in Washington, D.C., June 22 ~ 29,

1. Fight any attempt on the part of
the National NAACP Office to reaffirm its role
of legal action instead of direct action in
connection with the civil rights struggle.
Point out that to rely on court action is a
retreat to gradualism.

NW 55136 DocId:32989572- Page 1032



NY 100-7629

2. Tackle the poverty question.
Develop a program linking ghettos with the
poverty program and urge spending of money to
wipe out ghettos.

“3. Explore the possibility of
7 utilizing youth in changing the leadership of
the NAACP.

4, Reaffirm or try again to get the”
NAACP to go back. to the Supreme Court and re-

that in the annual report, tribute was paid to
the memory of DU BOIS, quite in contrast to any
previous conventions of the NAACP, which has
fought to re-write the history of the organi-
zation and leave out the efforts of DU BOIS.

A meeting of ‘the Peace Club of the
Kings’ County CP was held on Mey 19, 1964, at
2hO Crown Street, Brooklyn, New York. ‘The
main discussion at the meeting concerned it-
self with the demonstration sponsored by the
NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE) held May 18, 1964, at City Hall in New
York City, celebrating the 10th anniversary of
the Supreme Court decision concerning school -
integration.

WILLIAM L. PATTERSON spoke and .-
stated that he feels and the CP dlso feels
- that it was not a good demonstration, He
stated that the role of the leaders was not
good in the demonstration. PATTERSON stated
that nothing positive had come out on this
demonstration whatsoever.

PATTERSON said that the Negro civil
rights struggle should have unity of all of
the different organizations at all costs. He
said that this demonstration had been a big
blow to the civil rights movement in New York
City because it had shown the lack of unity
between the organizations and the civil rights
leaders.

PATTERSON stated that this demon-

stration is important enough to discuss at
future meetings of the club. He said that

-15-

NW 55136 DocId:32989572 Page 1040


NY 100-7629

the club members should have 2 therough under-
standing of the demonstration and the results
of it. . ‘ :

PATTERSON stated that the growth of
the Party or the Party's failure to grow will
hinge on the unity that the Party may develop 7
among the civil rights forces and their leaders;
‘the unity between the Negro and the white; and
the unity between the Negro civil rights organi-
zations and the labor movement. PATTERSON
“stated that if the Party does not undertake
this and succeeed, it‘ will be erucial.

©

PATTERSON stated that the Party has
forces in the organizations such as the NAACP
anc CORE. He stated that these forces should
speak up at meetings of these organizations -
and be critical of the leaders of these
organizations,

: 7 PATTERSON stated that the NAACP in
| New York has about 22,000 members and CORE has
thousands and wondered where all of these mem-
bers were for the demonstration. PATTERSON
stated that this demonstration had been. spon-
sored by the NAACP and CORE and some of the
unions and that they should have seen to it
that it was a mass demonstration, which it
was not.

.all forces to present a.united front of action.
The new groups will also bring in new courses
for action to advance the struggle. © PATTERSON

this meeting, JAMES TORMEY stated-that "we"
should concentrate in the NAACP and the Negro
American Labor Council (NALC) because we have
good contacts in these organizations, however,
it is difficult to penetrate CORE or the

Urban League because they have white leader-
Ship. TORMEY stated that we must concentrate
our efforts in mass organization work and in
_our unions and even though our number is small,
each of us at this meeting should be able to
move thousands of people.

: TORMEY mentioned that there is no
need to create issues because big issues are
in existence. These issues include civil
rights, the war on poverty and the fight for
a minimum wage of $1.50 per hour, which must -
be waged by the unions.

effort to keep the Communists

out in the open, not to suppress
them by law or by force. They
should be opposed politically,

by showing how their support of
truly liberal causes always harms
such causes, and that their only
real purpose is to advance the
interests of Soviet Russia and
defend her dictatorship and her
acts of aggression. To try to
suppress the Communists would
merely drive them underground or -
into various camouflaged organi~
zations and ‘would harm, not help,
the task of opposing their ideas."

1964 Annual Report

"The Crisis" of February, 1965, contains
the results of the annual meeting of the NAACP held
ao6e West 40th Street, New York City, on January 4,

NAACP memberships for the year, 1964,
totaled 452,432, as of December 18, 1964, Included
in the total are 360,500 branch memberships,

65,000 in college chapters and Youth Councils,
16,000 life members and subscribers, and nearly
11,000 memberships at large.

Chicago with 24,660 members is the
country's largest NAACP branch followed by Detroit
with 21,740. Other large branches include
Cleveland, 17,001; Philadelphia, 12,500; Baltimore,
9,400; Washington, D.C., 9,065; Pittsburgh, 8,475; :

St. Louis, 5,100.. c

The cutback in membership last year,
much of it in the large cities, may be "accounted
for by the fact that NAACP community leaders were
involved in such major activities as lobbying for
passage of the civil rights bill and in voter
registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns".

Mr. ROY WILKINS, Executive Director, in
his report. to the Board of Directors, stated that
the achievement above all others in 1964 was the
enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,and the
development second in importance was the emergence
of Negro American voters as a very significant
force in the political affairs of the nation.

Among the items of highest priority in
the NAACP Program for 1965 through 1968 will be the
continuation of the voter registration. Mr.
WILKINS further reported that in line with the
convention resolutions, the NAACP in 1965 will
continue efforts to make the Anti-Poverty Act
meaningful for Negro citizens. The convention
recognized that more than ever before the
Association's program must be a varied and flexibie
one, not tied to the one method of demonstrations.
The NAACP will help its branches to establish
citizenship clinics in communities across the
nation. With the help of the Civil Rights Act,
the broad goal of these clinics will be the
assumption of full citizenship responsibilities
along with utilization of full citizenship rights. q

Communist Party (cP) Attempts to Infiltrate

During April, 1965, a meeting was held between
leading CP individuals in the Chicago area to discuss a
forthcoming NAACP Convention scheduled to be held in Denver,
Colorado in June, 1965. At this meeting it was stated that it
was essential that Party activity in connection with this
Convention must be directed to the area of voting rights and
registration, It was further stated that in the South emphasis
must be placed on greater voting registration and Negro repre-
sentation, while in the ilorth emphasis must be placed on
inereasing quality of Negro representation. It was also
stated that 1t may not be necessary to introduce resolutions
as such at this Convention; however, the Party must be alert
to amend or institute discussion on ideas presented at this
Convention which come within the framework of voting rights
and registration,

NY 100-7629 ; ,

During the latter part-of April, 1965, a dis-
cussion was held between tivo Communist Party members who
are active in the affairs of the NAACP concerning the forthcoming
National Convention of the NAACP scheduled to be held in Denver,
Colorado, in June, 1965. During this discussion it was stated a
decision must be arrived upon concerning certain issues to be
brought forth at the NAACP Convention. Among the issues
discussed were the following:

1) The question of vote -- During the discussion,
it was reiterated that the decision set down by leading
Communist Party forces must be followed, namely, that
there must be increased voter registration in the South
and the Party must strive to improve the quality of
representation in the Worth. It was stated that the
National Office of the NAACP now appears to be ready to
assert additional influence in the political action field;
therefore, the Party forces at the Convention should
explore the possibility of trying to commit the convention
to a much broader policy for actively participating in
election campaigns.

2) Foreign affairs -- a discussion was held
on the current Viet Nam and African crises; however, it was
decided that this problem must be set asice until it is
determined what forces are available at the Convention auc
who woulé be in a position to submit such resolutions.
it was felt that known Party forces at the Convention
corld not present such resolutions.

3) Domestic ~- A discussion was held con-
cerning the establishment of multiple branches of the

this plan was tried in Texas and California and has been
apparently successful. Also, it was learned that the
Chicago NAACP is against this plan and hopes to present a
resolution to reject this plan. If such a plan is passed,

the Chicago Branch would be broken dowm into five or six
smaller branches. During this discussion, it was felt
vhat should the multiple branch plan be accepted, it

would bring about greater membership participation and in
this way it was also felt that Party forces could function
more effectively in multiple branches. It was, therefore,
decided that all efforts should be made to back any
resolution in favor of the multiple branch policy.

LIGHTFOOT took with him from Chicago to Denver
several hundred copies of "The Worker” and a number of
yamphlets on colonialism. He later indicated these items
vere distributed by Denver CP people. He was able to obtain
apress badge and was observed in and about the convention
on several occasions.

"The Worler" is an East Coast Communist
newspaper.

Prior to the Convention, LIGHTFOOT directed a
GP of Illinois membex, who is active in the affairs of the
WAACP, to attend this convention. LIGHTFOOT suggested that
they not set up a GP caucus in the true sense but he proposed
to set up a group of several CP members and several p' ons
progressive and/or sympathetic to the CP. This was d
ané this “group" mst on three occasions during the convention.
They discussed strategy in regard to defeating the Chicago
Branch resolution to reject the plan of multiple branches;
support for the Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party and,
last, the injection of the peace issue. They were successful
in the first two endeavors mainly through pressures exerted
as individuals on various officers but ‘were soundly beaten
on the peace issue.

LIGHTFOOT met with various individuals from time
to time to keep abreast of convention activities but did
not participate as such in any discussions of the "group".

NAACP Convention and stated that this Convention of the

in regards to the civil rights question. He stated that he
was disappointed that the NAACP Convention did r support
@ peace proposal and did not ask for a withdra: of
American troops fron Viet Nam. He stated that there was
some red-baiting, in fact, more at this Convention than at
other Conventions. that he had recently attended.

LIGHTFOOT stated that one of the good points in

better organized this time than they had been before.

Communist Party (CP)
Attempts to Infiltrate

On October 9, 1965, a CP faction within the NAACP j
held a meeting at the Great Northern Hotel, New York City.
The meeting was attended by both CP and non-CP members.

, :
cravng zfGurroor, a Ieading functionary of the
CP of Illinois,“led the meeting and outlined the developments
in the Civil Rights Movement, pointing out that the movement
had been broken down into various stages, namely: 1. The
Montgomery bus boycott; 2. Sit-ins by students; 3. In-
volvement of labor forces in the North; 4. The Birmingham
phase which brought about larger demonstrations in the
North; 5, The Watts phase which brought about a new era
in the Civil Rights movement, wherein the spotlight for
the first time has been placed on the economic plight of
the Negroes. It is the first time an awareness of the
economic nature of the Civil Rights movement has been
instituted.

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT also stated that it was now
possible for the Party to influence the NAACP through direct
pressure on the membership and to force the membership
to become involved in various issues that are nov projects
of the NAACP as such, but are projects instituted by other
Civil Rights organizations. :

LIGHTFOOT went on to state that the object of this
meeting was to map out a program for decisively influencing
the NAACP in the future. He stated that it was no longer
sufficient for the Party just to be in attendance at open
NAACP affairs; it was now possible to influence the activ-
ities of the NAACP. LIGHTFOOT added that it was hoped that
the Party could institute this influence in three directions:

Ww 55136 Docld:32986572 “ Page 1280-°

NY 100-7629

1. Give leadership to economic problems and in
this manner push the peace issue, noting that economic
problems can only be solved through the expenditure of
funds and these funds could be obtained by a reduction in
war spending. It might also be suggested that there be a cut
back in armaments and use these funds to alleviate economic
problems.

2. Force the NAACP to become active in all Civil
Rights struggles not just in those struggles which are
initiated, organized, and run by the NAACP. The NAACP
in the past has been hesitant to actively engage in Civil
Rights struggles that are not initiated by the NAACP.

d 3. Attempt to get the NAACP more firmly involved
in political activity.

LIGHTFOOT questioned the group whether they
thought it would be feasible to develop a “left caucus"
in various branches of the NAACP and the group felt that
this was possible. It was stated that there were 13 branches
of the NAACP in New York and possibly a "left caucus" could
be developed within these branches. Also, it was stated
thac it might be possible to develop such a caucus within the
Chicago NAACP, LIGHTFOOT stated that he felt he could
develop such a caucus on the west coast, in Baltimore, and
ain Detroit. LI@HTFOOT mentioned to the group that he
thought the group should again meet some time in the early
part of 1966, in order that a planned program can be
developed, in connection with the next NAACP National
Convention, in order that the impact of the Party program
might be felt at the next NAACP National Convention.

. On January 22, 1966, per instructions of CLAUDE

! LIGHTFOOT, a CP faction within the NAACP, held a meeting at
: the Sheraton Cadillac Hotel, in Detroit, Michigan. .Some

of the individuals in attendance were not known as CP
members. This meeting was held to discuss strategy

and plans in connection with the forthcoming NAACP

National Convention to be held sometime during the

Summer of 1966. This meeting was quite informal and

there was no prepared agenda.

Individuals in attendance at this meeting
held discussions concerning the following matters:

1. Ways and means of developing a caucus
that will be able to function at the forthcoming
NAACP National Convention. In order to develop this
caucus it was felt that the recently approved decen-
tralization of some branches must be ironed out in .
order that all branches may become decentralized.

It was felt that the CP would be able to function

more efficiently under the decentralization plan.

It was pointed out that while the Detroit Branch did

not vote for decentralization it was felt that should
there be changes effected in the structure of decentrali-
zation the Detroit Branch would go along with such a

plan and in this way there would be unity throughout

all NAACP branches.

2. Concerning the peace issue, it was stated
that the Party could not approach this issue from a foreign
policy aspect; however, this tssue should be appreached
in relation to anti-poverty programs and educational
programs pointing out the need for expenditure of
additional funds for these purposes and withdraw funds ear-
marked for foreign policy to accomplish this.

NY 100-7629

‘3. Concerning the resolutions committees, it
was also decided that where possible the Party should
compromise and give up membership on other committees
in order to obtain delegates on the resolutions committee.
It was hoped to capture the four regional delegates to

the resolutions committee in the Midwest area even if it meant

losing membership in other committees.

It was also stated that every effort should be
made to place acceptable members ‘on the NAACP Board
located in New York, since under New York laws the Board
is solely responsible for running the organization.

It was also decided at this meeting that if pos-

sible all individuals present would attempt to attend similar

meeting, tentatively scheduled for sometime in February,

1966, in New York City.

NAACP 57th Annual Convention
duly 5 - 9, 1966 at Los Angeles, California

At the July 8; 1966, session of the Convention,
a leaflet was read at the Convention, which had been distribut ed
in Portland, Oregon, advising citizens to take up arms and
defend ‘themselves against police brutality. The leaflet was
signed by the "Communist Party". At this point, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT
van down the aisle to the microphone and identified himself as
“an officer of the Communist Party and as such disclaimed any
association with the handbill read".
Hae 48, 1966

A meeting of the Lorraine Hansberry Club,
CP of Illinois, was held on July 19, 1966, in Chicago, Tllinois.
At this meeting, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, a leading functionary of the
CP of Illinois, gave an analysis of the NAACP Convention.
LIGHTFOOT stated that he felt the 1966 NAACP Convention reached
nM all-time low as far as the organization is concerned. What
the leadership tried to do was to convince the participants

Administration. This Convention was tied hand and foot to
the JOHNSON Administration. The NAACP leadership had the
following objectives for the Convention:
y

: and attack the concept of black power
the ranks of the Negro peo
fear in any white supporters
be considering supporting the concest of
black power

LIGHTFOOT concluded that it would be premature for
che CE to abandon werk in the NAACP in spite of the many problems
“sist. He indicated that he had been to New tork for a
a1 Board meeting to report on the NAACP Convention. The
Party's position on the topic black power is not to clash with
those who advance the slogan; however, the Party does not agree
with every action and concept advanced by those who advocate black
power. The party will continue to work in all movements tlat are
fighting for political representation for Negroés‘on the
question of self defense and non-violence.

direct the organization toward a more militant approach wo
the civil rights pregram. This movement has been brewing
for sever:1 years and came into the open during the NAACP
National Tonvention at Los Angeles, Californie, in July,
1966. -Hoxever, resolutions leeding to a change in NAACP
policy were defeated in committee and never got to the floor.

State Conference tends to be of a somewhat dissident kind
within the NAS The state leadership is interested in
increasing its influence on the National Board in opposition

The "New York Times", October 24, 1966, Page 19,
carried an article entitled "State NAACP Adopts Plan of
** Rebellious Youth Division.” The article related that members

of the NAACP Youth Division walked out of the New York State
‘Convention of the NAACP chapters held October 23, 1966, at }
Lido, Beach, New York. The 157 teenagers in the Youth Division 7
returned later with a group of resolutions that were adopted

by the delegates to the State Convention. Dr. EUGENE T. REED,

State Chairman of the NAACP, said their resolutions were far ~~ et
superior to several general and vaguely worded resolutions “Y
submitted by adult~led committees. The Youth Division aimed

at dealing "with the problems in the Ghetto and to make con~

crete suggestions for slum improvement now."

Concerning the January, 1967 elections on the
National Board of the NAACP, the “conservative element"
“was victorious over the younger "progressive element."

“$i, EXTENT CF COMMUNIST PARTY
INFLUENCE IN NAACP

A. Assessment of Communist Party
Policy Regarding NAACP
7

The Communist Party, United States of
America (CP, USA), has always been interested in
attempting to get connected with movements or groups .
with the aid of entrenching its own leadership and
drawing on that movement for members to join the CP.
It is especially interested in the militant type of
groups and considers these elements as already quite
advanced ideologically in terms of recognizing the need
for militant action. The CP favors the growth and
expansion of groups who oppose United States intervention
in Vietnam and whose policies generally are opposed
to the JOHNSON administration.

At the same time, the CP moves as carefully
as possible in order no% to antagonize. the moderate section
of civil rights movement such as the NAACP.

NY 1.7
November 23, 1966

During mid July, 1966, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT*,
Chairman of the Illinois District CP, referring to the
NAACP National Convention held in Los Angeles,
California, in July, 1966, said that in his judgment
the NAACP reached an ‘all time low" for the NAACP.
LIGHTFOOT, however, stated at that time that it wouid
be premature for the CP to abandon work in the NAACP
in spite of the many problems that existed.

B. Assessment of NAACP Policy
Regarding Communist Party

NY T-2 made available on June 21, 1966, a
pamphlet entitled, ‘NAACP, An American Organization'.
The following quotation is set forth on the back of the
cover page of this pamphlet: -

“As in the past, the Association
. will employ every reasonable measure in
keeping with democratic orgatizational
principles to prevent the endorsers, the
supporters and defenders of the Communist
conspiracy from joining or participating
in any way in the work of the NAACP.

"Resolutions, 47th Annual
: NAACP Convention
San Francisco, June 26, 1956"

The pamphiet deals with a refutation of charges
that the NAACP is ‘Communist dominated" or ~~.

“subversive’, It sets forth the following arguinents
against any “allegation of CP influence or control
Piola in the NAACP:

"The NAACP position on the Communist Party
is clear and unequivocal:

"1, The NAACP is not, and never has been,
listed as subversive by any Federal official or agency.

"2, The NAACP was established and its basic
anti-segregation program formulated before the Communist
Party of the U.S.A, was organized.

- "3, The NAACP is not now, and never has
been, in any measure dominated by the Communist party.

4, The NAACP has a long record of fighting
the Communist party.

"S, The NAACP has firmly and consistently
turned back efforts of the Communists to infiltrate
the organization.

"6, The NAACP has, from its beginning, enjoyed
br piduny of eminent Americans of both races and all
aiths.

"7, The NAACP's Americanism has been -

recognized by the nation's press.

"8, The NAACP is a thoroughly American
organization.

"Q, The NAACP makes no concession either to
the Left or the Right".

The following is excerpted from Pages 8 and
12 of the above pamphlet:

“Because the Communists have periodically tried
to penetrate and capture the NAACP, the Association's
annual convention in Boston, June, 1950, passed a
resolution ‘directing and instructing the Board of
Directors to take the necessary action to eradicate
such infiltration and, if necessary, to suspend and

reorganize, or lift the charter and expel any unit, which,

in the judgment of the Board of Directors, upon 2
basis of finding of the aforementioned investigation
and study of local units, comes under Communist or
other political control and action!.

. "Phe business of the NAACP is to work for
civil rights, for the elimination of racial barriers,
for an America with full equality for all its citizens.
It was founded for, and has adhered to, this high
purpose, The association does not propose to be

“diverted from this goal by the enemies of our
country, either of the Left or the Right. The Association
will not be intimidated by the threats and smears of
the white supremacy cabal. Nor will it let down the
bars against the red conspiracy. The Association will
. continue to operate as an American organization."

This source, an official of the NAACP National
@ifice advised on November 21, 1966, that he knows
: of no CP members operating within the NAACP; furthermore, the
CP exercises no influence or control in the policy
and direction of the NAACP.

NY T-1
November 21, 1966

Lieutenant JOSEPH LANE, Long Beach Police
Department, Long Beach, New York, advised January 23,
1967, that he was not aware of any information in-

~
former members of the Group at New York fei met informally
in support of the Detroit group, which had isnued neither
directions nor instructions. The New York Group has no
officers or headquarters.

On March 7, 1963, the same source advised that
the Facing Reality Publishing Company or Committee seeks
to create a Marxist society based on the dialectical con-
cepts of Marxism-Ieninism as interpreted by C. L. R. JAMES,
establishing government by a Marxist political party. The
prime movement in securing the support of the people is
considered to be used by the workers in their daily fight
against capitalism. This group rejects the vanguard party
concept of Marxism and has established tt theory that trade
unions keep the workers under subjugation by preventing
their channeling of their own efforts to take over the
means of praduction and through this to in turn take over
governmental processes. This group rejects all present
forms of governments, except those new nationalist govern-
ments, as capitalists, or in the case of Russia, | State
Capitalist.

Ori May 4, 1965, the same source advised that the
Facing Reality Publishing Committee continues to meet at
3513 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.

between the legitimate activities and those espousing
the CP line. ’

The above letter further pointed out that where
evidence of local infiltration was developed, the case should
remein in a pending status. In the event no evidence of
infiltration was developed, a letter so advising would be
sufficient, however, the offices should remain alert for
subsequent information. The letter stated that the matter
should be followed and the Bureau and NYO advised every six
months by report or letter as to the situation. In the interim,
any pertinent information received or.developed should be
furnished the Bureau and NYO.

This letter further instructed the NYO that after
the initial 60 day period, the NYO should prepare a report
setting forth a summary of all pertinent information reflecting
the CP infiltration of the NAACP on a nation-wide basis, which
procedure was to be followed every six months, on October 15
and April 15.

It is noted that the past history of the CP, USA,
demonstrates that once the party has selected a target for
infiltration in an attempt to influence policy, it has rarely
been able to accomplish its objectives with any degree of
subtlety.

Extensive investigation hes been conducted by the
NYC since 1954, on the basis of Communist infiltration into the
NAACP, and to date a review of this case file in the NYO and
of the reports submitted from other field offices to the NYO,
reflects that over the years the success achieved by the CP in
infiltrating the NAACP is almost non-existent in that it is
weak and ineffective, and no known CP influence is in evidence.
There has been no evidence reported to indicate that the CP
dominates, controls or has infiltrated the NAACP to an extent
where they are promulgating policy, and in addition thereto,

-B-

—NW—5543.6—Docid: 32989572 Page 1247



NY 100-7629

there is no evidence or indication wherein the CP, USA,
exerts any influence in any branches of the NAACP. There
are no known CP members in a policy-making position in the
NAACP. The NYO sources could adequately alert the NYO
should the CP,in the future, attempt to utilize its members
to infiltrate the NAACP, at which time the Bureau would be
advised immediately. Accordingly, this case is being placed
in a closed status in the NYO and hereafter, any information
developed and pertinent to Communist infiltration of the
ACP will be followed under the individual case caption

of that particular individual and in addition thereto, will
be followed in the case entitled "Communist Influence in
Racial Matters; Is-c" (BU 100-442529) (NY 100-153735), UACB.

a daily newspaper of Bridgeport, Connecticut,
reflected that ALFRED BAKER LEWIS of Greenwich,
Connecticut, was elected Treasurer of the CCPAC

on May 25, i946.

The September 9, 1949, issue of the "Hartford
Times," a daily newspaper of Hartford, Connecticut,
contained an article by ALFRED BAKER LEWIS which
stated "Those of us who are opposed to Communism
should bend every effort to keep the Communists out
in the open, not to suppress them by law or by force.
They should be opposed politically, by showing how
their support of truly liberal causes always harms

"such causes, and that their only real purpose

is to advance the interests of Soviet Russia and
defend her dictatorship and her acts of aggression.
fo try to suppress the Communists would merely
drive them underground or into various camouflaged
organizations and would harm, not help, the task
of opposing their ideas."

PICKETING OF NAACP NATIONAL CONVENTION

As a result of a late afternoon news broadcast on July 1,
1967, that President JOHNSON was. scheduled to arrive at Boston at
6:00 p.m., that date, to speak before the National Convention
of the NAACP, a picket line organized by the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA) of Boston and the Socialist Workers Party (SUP),
Boston elements under the name "Greater Boston Spring Mobiliza-
tion Committee" began to picket the convention on the sidewalk
in front of the War Memorial Auditorium at about 6:00 p.m. with
approximately 150 participants. Some of the signs carried
read "Hell No! We Won't Go;" "Get Troops Out of Vietnam;" "Resist
the Draft;" "Bring Troops Home Now." The group marched until
shortly after 8:00 p.m., by which time the number of participants
had doubled. At the same time, and while the foregoing was
ta.King place, another picket line began across the street from
the auditorium. This latter group, which carried signs calling
for peace in Vietnam, dispersed at about 7:30 p.m. with many
joining the former picket line in front of the auditorium. Order
was maintained by the Boston Police Department and no incidents
took place. 7

III. EXTENT OF COMMUNIST PARTY (CP)
INFLUENCE IN THE NAACP

The CP, USA, cannot infiltrate the NAACP as far
as a policy-making position is concerned, due to the complex
democratic structure of the NAACP. The CP may have, at one
time, attempted to infiltrate the NAACP, but at this time does
not have a chance to infiltrate any policy-making position,
inasmuch as anyone with any indication of sympathy toward the
CP or one who follows the CP line, is stopped at the branch
level, thus preventing any CP member or sympathizer to gain a
policy-making position. Due to the NAACP structure, infiltration
of the NAACP is not possible, and any attempts of that nature,
over the years, have been stopped in the early stages.

The NAACP holds annual conventions which are open
to the public, and although observers may attend the convention,
observers do not and cannot present resolutions to the convention.
The only resolutions presented, are those made up by the
Resolutions Committee at their own private meeting, which is
held separately at the time of the convention. The Resolutions
Committee is a body of 35 individuals selected by the delegates
to the convention, and they are identified at the convention by
badges, and are well known to one another. In the event a
delegate attempted to obtain a fraudulent badge, it would only
be a matter of minutes before the impersonator were discovered.

poset Ta saa

NW 55136 DocId:32989572 Page 1264 : ee


NY 100-7529

With regard to the delegates elected from the
seven geographical sections of the country, there are approxi-
mately 1500 delegates chosen from the numerous chapters of
the NAACP, within the geographical sections. Each chapter,
according to its size, elects its respective number of
delegates to attend the convention. Each delegate is chosen
on the basis of his long tedious work performed in that
respective chapter, and in all cases the delegate is well
known within the chapter for the type of work he has performed.
If for any reason the individual does not conform to the
policy of the NAACP at that level, he is soon discovered and
in a short time is relieved of his membership in that chapter.
The delegate, consequently, is one chosen who would best
represent that chapter, and in numerous instances, has been
the same delegate choseyear after year. The delegate is
an individual who performs years of work within the chapter,
‘us ‘never one who has just joined a chapter, and the duties
ne performed according to NAACP policy, are checked long before
ne would be nominated and voted as a delegate.

Once the delegate is elected to attend the convention,
he is considered one of about 1500 delegates. At the convention,
the delegates themselves vote among themselves and elect 35
of their delegates to the Resolutions Committee. If by chance
one of the delegates were not screened at the chapter level,
he would certainly be screened at the National Convention long
before he could become one of the 35 delegates to the Resolutions
Committee. When on the Resolutions Committee, any policy
presented which does not conform to the NAACP policy,or if
by some reason one of the delegates presents a resolution at
that level, which conforms to the CP line, he is immediately
questioned at the Committee level, prior to bringing the
resolution before the National Convention. In the past, there
have been individuals who were elected as delegates who
advocated some type of militancy, but were soon discovered
and easéd out of the organization, long before they ever could
become a member of the Resolutions Committee.

~12-

NW 55136 DocId:32989572 Page 1265



NY 100-7529

Once the Resolutions Committee votes, agrees, and
presents a resolution before the National Convention,
observers who are not members of the NAACP may ask questions.
This questioning does not in any way dictate policy, because
even if the Resolutions Committee votes and agrees to present
a particular resolution, the final approval rests with the
Board of Directors of the NAACP. The Board of Directors can
easily disapprove any resolution at that level. Any policy
of the NAACP rests with the Board of Directors of the NAACP.
The Board of Directors of the NAACP meets four times a year,
and the Executive Committee of the NAACP meets monthly. The
Executive Committee is composed of top functionaries of the
NAACP who are the tp echelon from the various districts of
the United States. The Executive Committee reports to the
Board of Directors, consequently anyone on the Executive
Committee is one of long outstanding leadership in the NAACP,
who has come up through the ranks after numerous years of
devoted service and one who is well known among his associates
for the duties performed. The Executive Committee seldom
changes from year to year, with the exception of ill health
or death, at which time a replacement is chosen based on his
years of service, devotion, and his notoriety, in the respective
area where he resides. Members of the Executive Committee are
screened by the Board of Directors of the NAACP, long before
they are approved and appointed.

The NAACP carefully notes, through their own means,
the latest line dictated by the CP, and if for any reason
suspects an individual of following their line or being
sympathetic toward the CP, he is carefully eased out of the
NAACP and his membership therein is cancelled.

There is no CP influence in the NAACP and the CP
has no possible means of infiltrating the NAACP in any
policy-making position whatsoever.

Doctor H,. CLAUDE HUDSONS Dentist, 4266 South
Central Avenue, Los Angeles, California, who is a member of
the National Board of Directors of the NAACP, and a past
President of the Los Angeles Branch of the NAACP, advised
on October 12, 1965, that at the National Convention of the
NAACP held in 1950, Boston, Massachusetts, a resolution was
adopted giving the National Executive Board of the NAACP the
authority to cancel the charter of any branch of the NAACP
that might be found to be communist dominated or influenced.
This would preclude a CP member from holding office in the
NAACP or being a member of the NAACP if his CP membership were
known or ‘could be established, This resolution continued to

NY 100-104142

The Political Committee, CPUSA, in a letter dated
October 20, 1971, 2ddressed to “All Districts and Nationa. .
Committee Members”, stated it kad established a sub-committee
to discuss with PAUL NOVICK, Editor of the "Morning Freiheit",
the question of his Party status. The charges against NOVICK:
included his position that the 1967 Arab-Israeli war was a
war of self-defense on Israel's part; in his attitude toward
the Soviet Union, particularly with regard to the Jewish
question, he has increasingly departed from the position of
the Party so that his nationalism hes led him into an increas-
ingly anti-Soviet path; his opportunist capitulation to the
pressures of Jewish nationalism and Zionism has led him to
depart more and more from a Marxist-Leninist position and to
move in the direction of Jewish nationalism.

NOVICK's answers to these charges included the
following: .

"May I remind you that our Jewish mass organizations,

/ such as the ELF, embrace a mass movement reaching into scores

' of thousands of members, followers, participants in celebrations,
concerts. Many of these are mobilized for May Day demonstrations,

* Soviet celebrations, as well as for Party activities for the
‘Daily World". To shatter or destroy this force would only :
benefit the reactionaries, the racists, the anti-Sovieteers, etc.
What damage this would cause the general progressive movement
can easily be imagined..."

PAUL NOVICK, who was on the National

The ELF and the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies
issued a statement condemning the attacks on low-rent housing
: ae poor-and senior citizens of Forest Hills, Queens, New
Het York. :

The statement called upon the residents of Forest
Hillis to withdraw their opposition to the building of low-

rent housing project or "face the ignominy of acting as racists,
despite claims to the contrary by the leadership".

The Jewish Cultural Clubs and

Societies is the successor to the

lodges of the dissolved Jewish

People's Fraternal Order, designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450. It
aims to continue the cultural, fraternal
and civic activities of the former lodges.

: - Concerning the attempt to expel PAUL NOVICK, which
was discussed only at the National Committee meeting of the
CPUSA and did not come up at the 20th National Convention,
there seemed to be an atmosphere of pacification toward NOVICK
by HYMAN LUMER, ALEX KOLKIN and JACK KLING, menbers of the
‘National Committee, CPUSA.

ioeene At the National Committee meeting, it was recommended
that NOVICK be suspended and after six months, if he has not
modified his views and aligned them more with GP policies and
to carry out the decisions of the current National Convention,
the suspension will automatically become an expulsion.

NY 100-140142

The former hard line attitude of the Party toward
NOVICK was undoubtedly influenced by a pro-NOVICK Letter
from four prominent left-wing progressives in Party Jewish
work. Among these four was LEAH NELSON. These four rep-
resent the total leadership of the leftist’ progressive
Jewish mass organizations in the United States. In their
letter, they said NOVICK's views are the views of each of
them. This letter wdoubtedly restrained the Party leader-
ship in ‘the NOVICK matter.

"after all, the 'Morning Freiheit' is a mobilizer
and organizer! It reflects the activites of the people's
organizations. Yes it is the dynamo of these organizations.
Greater readership of the 'Morning Freiheit' meays*. greater
membership for the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies, for
the Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs, for
the Yiddisher Kultur Farband. The affairs run by all these
organizations would not be possible without the ‘Morning

all these activites, is capable of being a factor in the
Jewish progressive movement, and in the Jewish community
as a whole",

The items discussed were as follows:

delegation to back a resolution for reinstatement of
ROBERT FNWILLIAMS in the NAACP, The national board
of directors of the NAACP suspended WILLIAMS from his
position as President of the Monroe, North Carolina
Branch of the NAACP. This resulted because WILLIAMS
advocated mob-violence to counteract discrimination in
the South and specifically stated to combat “lynchings
with lynchings" or to ‘meet violence with violence".

2. SCOTT and WALLACE agreed to work together
in an effort to introduce a resolution recommending the
NAACP support Africans in Kenya and Algeria in their
freedom fight and as a corollary tothis the support
of colonial peoples everywiuere in their freedon
fight.

4, BILL SCOTT was to engage a Brooklyn
delegate to raise on the floor of the Convention his
situation wherein he had been denied union office to which
he had been duly elected, His plea would be discrimination.
WALLACE would attempt to get his delegation from Jersey
City to support this issue if it was raised on the floor.

NY T-3 on July 31, 1959, advised that a meeting
of the llth A.D. Club, Harlem Area CP was Held on July 24,
1959. <Atthe meeting the National NAACP Convention was
discussed and it was announced that the CP had members
present at the Convention who met in caucus with the
delegates in order to give the NAACP a broader labor
and civil rights platform. It was stated that
results could not.be expected at once due to the
limited forces the CP have in the NAACP, however, the
ground work has been started for a more mili
leadership within the NAACP,

NY T-4 on July 28, 1959, advised that the
National Executive Committee of the CP, USA, heid
a meeting in July, 1959, at which the NAACP Convention
was discussed.

PETTIS PERRY spoke and criticized the
NAACP Convention for not pointing out the unfinished
task before the Negro Liberation Movement. He said
that a number of Southern States are defying the
Supreme Court desegregation decision and aithough
local battles have been won Jim Crow still prevails
in the South. :

NW 55136 DPocId:32989572,. Page 1335



NY 100-7629

He daimed that there was less "“red~baiting"
at the Convention then heretofore, but a statement
was made at the Convention that the fight ag
Jim Crow should be on, a par with the fight a
Communism in unions, PERRY accused ROY WILKIKS,
‘Executive Secretary of the NAACP of “red-baiting”
for having compared Dixiecrats with Bolsheviks.
He noted a number of good resolutions had been
presented at the Convention, one against the Me
Carran Act and one on migratory workers.

PERRY stated that with reference to
left progressive forces in the NAACP, the Party
must examine these weeknesses and take some
fundamental organizatioral steps.

Regarding thé WILLTAMS-case PERRY stated
that the CP had at first supported ROBERT WILLIAMS
in his fight against the national leadership of
the NAACP, however, WILLIAMS arrived at the Convention

with a document circulated py Trotsky yites and the
CP withdrew,

HUNTER PITTS O'DELL observed that the
militancy of the NAACP Convention was restricted
by petty bourgeois leadership and anti-Communism.

+
WILLIAM L, PATTERSON spoke and stated
that the NAACP Con ntion did not meet its responsibility
and ideologically took a step backward. PATTERSON
said “we have argued in the Party that the strength
of a Negro in the struggle in America exceeds his
numerical strength in the population,"

This being noted with reference to the NAACP as
a mass organization which ‘has tremendous
potential for influence among the Negro people,

NY T-6 in July, 1959, identified PETTIS i
PERRY as a member of the National Committee, CP,
USA,

NY T-5 on March 4, 1959, identified HUNTER ~
PITTS O'DELL as assistant to JAMES E, JACKSON,
Secretary, Negro and-Southern Affairs, CP, USA,

newspaper issue of October 12, 1958, page 14,

of "The Worker",

NY T-7 on July 22, 1959, advised that a
meeting was held on July 18, 1959, in New York City,
of CP members and persons who.had ssociated with
CP members, for the purpose of giscussing the results of
CP activity in connection with the NAACP Convention,

The informant reported that OLIVER MARTIN 2”
opened up this recapitulation meeting by dealing
with the question of youth participation in the
National NAACP Convention, He cited the failure
of the NAACP organization to integrate youth into
the NAACP and accept them as fellow citizens of the
organization. The youthhad a separate Convention, which
was held at the Henry Hudson Hotel, but no effort
was made to get them into the Convention itself.

itea



NY 100-7629

MARTIN stated that the CP also failed on this point
because no effort was made by the Party to bring
youth into the Convention either,

| MARTIN continued stating that he made a
motion on the floor of the Convention to try to have
one youth cn each committee set up by the Convention.
This motion was agreed to in princhple: but was not
formally adopted as such as there was no vote taken
on it.

In discussing the question of the WILLIAMS
Case, MARTIN stated that he thought the WILLIAMS
question had been pretty muchthemajor issue at the
Convention. He recalled that he had made a plea in the
Gefense of WILLIAMS on the floor of the Conventicn,
yut.no one at the Convention wanted to repu te the
action of the National Board concerning WILLIAMS, .
and he was dismayed at the speed at which it reached

and get the facts before making such a far reaching
decision with such national publicity involved. MARTIN
had suggested that the national leadership adopt a
policy of not acting with such naste.

According to the informant MARTIN further
stated that the Hational leadership had 1 ized very
thoroughly and had done a good jo» on WILLIAMS,

He was disappointed in the Farty's action at the
Convention. He pointed out the party's failure
to send adequate forces and the failure to send
people to the Convention to de floor leaders, who
could act on motions,

MARTIN added that he felt that generally
it was a good Convention and was characterized by an
amazing Lack of"red-baiting”. Only one person,

A, PHILID RANDOLPH did any “red-baiting" and he went
out of his way to drag it

ee!
Informant advised that following MARTIN,
VU PETTIS PERRY spoke at great »-length about the Convention.

He reviewed the whole Convention and said in summary,
he felt it was one of the most positive Conventions,
Although most of the resolutions proposed or supported
by the CP were defeated, some did get attention, for
example, a resolution on breaking off relations with
Afviea, and the resolution calling for more
democracy in the NAACP received attention. The

! resolution on more democracy was brought before
the Convention and was accepted in spirit and

' embodied in a resolution of the Cleveland delegation,

PERRY also noted tne failure of tne NAACP to
reintroduce or pass an anti-Communist resolution. He
further noted the absence of "red-baiting" and felt
there was a generally friendly atmosphere at the
Convention,

| He stated that .t was possible at the

i Convention to talk with a number of peo who

i previously would not taki with him. In general,

H 1¢ felt there was a freer attitude at the
Convention,

»NY 100-7629

PERRY added that the Party's weakness
in connection with the Convention was somet
that will have to be taken up. He stated
can no longer put the Negro question down as
something that only gets ilip,service. The NAACP is.
one of the major organizations of the people.”

Informant ‘advised that following PERRY's
remarks, OLIVER MARTIN commented that ne did not
know if the Party should be happy about the fact that
the anti-Communist resolution was not introduced
at the Convention, He said that maybe the leader-
Ship of the NAACP did not titink the CP is amy longer
a threat,or perhaps no one gave a thought to the
Party. He added that this was probably because the
Party was not effective at the Convention.

Informant reported that TED BASSETT spoke
and challenged PETTIS PERRY's optimism about the
Convention. In defense PERRY stated that the change
in attitude at the Convention would present new
opportunities for the Party in the NAACP. He added
that the WILLIAMS question was a tory. The
Convention repudiated the Trotskyites and there were
Some who felt that the Party was behind the movement.
The Convention revealed an overwhelming vote against
the Trotskyites..

According to the informant LESTER-DAVIS
Spoke and also dealt with the WILLIAMS question. He
stated that from a tactical standpoint tiie action
on the WILLIAMS case was a defeat for the Party
and its tactics. The Party fought . to mediate and
arbitrate in the situationmt the national leadership
of the NAACP took action to annihilate WILLIAMS.

WILLIAMS the Party was uniting wits a courageous out-

"There were divergent views in the leadership of
the convention. This might well be changed by the exercise
of more powerful Negro and militant white labor influence.
he convention was one of contrasts. A united front of
tremendous political weight could be effected by a stronger
orientation toward the African Asian liberation
struggle. Victory in the Negro struggle is within the
grasp of those prepared to intensify and deepen the fight
all along the line. A survey of tne real worid that
confronted the 50th anniversary convention of the NAACP
reveals that every prerequisite necessary for victory
against racism is now present. But the enemy is
tough and ruthless. Militant democratic struggles will
modilize millions.

"The convention re-affirmed its slogan of
‘Free by 63.' What is the concept of this
‘free'? From what is it derived? Is it to be
given? The lessons of fifty years of struggle must
forever dispel this idealism. If it is to be fought
for the struggle must be planned.

“tPree by 63' presupposes a. fierce revolutionary
struggle to throw off the backs of the Negro people the
Social forces now seated there. Mr. RANDOLPH has
described these, The task of dislodging them cannot
be so lightly posed. The struggle must be a determined
and relentless one. Alliances with those who will
neither falter nor quail must be realized. American
reaction has no gifts of freedom for the Negro people.

The program of action that can win freedom by 63 is already
late indeed and has not yet been drafted. Yet the
people will alone decide the issues in their favor.

At the meeting NAT WEINSTEIN gave a report on the
NAACP Convention. He stated that from his point cf
view it was the worst Convention he had attended, The
machinery and leadership completely steamrollered tne
Supporters of ROBERT F, WILLIMS by pushing through a
unit rule on voting, passing out literature, denouncing
WILLIAMS' stand and“red-baiting" the whole issue. In
the final showdown only seventeen voted in support of
WILLIAMS, He said that the (cP elements played a cautious
role and did not expose thair hand. WEIKSTEIN further
stated that Reverend MILT ‘~GALAMISON , Pre ent, 1
Brooklyn NAACP Branch, frightened the Brooklyn delegation
with threats of reprisals from the national leadership if
they stirred up any trouble. WEINSTEIN stated that
a big disappointment was COKRAD LYNN, Attorney for i
WILLIAMS, who was supposed to lead the pro-WILLIAMS
forces, WEINSTEIN stated that LYNN did not know how to
conduct a minority struggle.

WEINSTEIN stated that the majority of the
delegates were middle class and professional people
and that many poor delegates from the South could not
afford to go to the Convention. The Convention adopted
resolutions for working within democratic machinery
such as the courts to bring about equal rights
and integration for the people. WEINSTEIN stated
that this was contrary to the feelings of the Negro
people, which ‘is why. such groups. such as the Negro
nationllists were making headway among the Negroes.
He said that the NAACP leadership was out of touch
with the Negro masses.

Informant stated that.. WEINSTEIN further
said that the Convention was a failure from "our
point of view" because WILLIAMS' stand on meeting
“violence with violence” was not given a hearing and the
steamrolier machinery of the leadership carried
the day. He said that one of the hopes they had
for the Convention was the pbuilding of a small but
strong left-wing element in the NAACP to step up
the struggle for integration. This was not achieved
and the only course remaining was to beg

of the NAACP Convention...’ His analysis differed somewhat
from that of NAT WEINSTEIN in that he was more optimistic
about the possibilities of developing a left-wing within
the NAACP around the WILLIAMS issue. WEISSMAN discussed
some of the problems in dealing with a man like WILLIAMS and
stated tnat WILLIAMS is a natural leader of the Negro
community and therefore it is possible to buiid around
him a mobilization @& the Negro masses, in the integration
and civil rights struggle. He said that WILLIAMS nas good
and bad points. According to WEISSMAN, WILLIAMS has told
the SWP that he would not be a puppet which is a good
point,since the SWP does not want a puppet but an
independent thinker. WILLIAMS is a man of principle and
a courageous fighter. The bad points are that ne is
stubborn and will not retreat and is given to off-the-cuff
statements which he refuses to modify. & was this trait
that the NAACP Bureaucrats were able to take
advantage of in the defeat which they handed WILLIAMS
at the Convention. WEISSMAN stated that the NAACP leaders
quoted at the Convention WILLIAMS! first fiery statememt
about counter-terror and ‘lynching the lynchers", Although
WILLIAMS had,after much persuasion, been convinced to back

if on his position,the NAACP leaders read from the
ginal statement and asked WILLIAMS whether he still
stood by his original statement. According to WEISSMAN,
WILLIAMS refused to back down. WEISSMAN further stated
that at the opening of the Convention WILLIAMS may have
had as much as one-third of the delegates backing his
Stand. However, because of his obstinacy.- in refusing
to back down and his association with the iegro
nationalists, who picketed and caused a rumpus in his defense,
many of the delegates, who might have stood by him,
capitulated to the leadership.

WEISSMAN also stated that WILLIAMS wavers
and pouts. For the longest period he insisted that he
was going to quit the NAACP and nothing anyone could say would
dissuade him. WILLIAMS presently is publishing a news -

letter called "Crusader" on a weekly basis in which he
states that he will remain in the NAACP, He will fight the
leadership and according to WEISSMAN this is a great
opportunity to spurt the growth of a left-wing.

WEISSMAN stated that not only the
SWP but all factions of radicals are after WILLIAMS.
At the Convention WILLIAMS was completely under the
shadow of the CP and several ex-SWP splits xineluding
the Marcyites. As such WILLIAMS is recognized as a
great possibility for the left,

WEISSMAN concluded by stating that although
the Convention was a decisive defeat for WILLIAMS and
a complete victory for the NAACP leadership, it showed
that the well-to-do Negroes such as lawyers, ministers,
and professionais, who were in the majority at the Convention,
were really the backhone of the anti-WILLIAMS sentiment,
whereas the rank and file Negro and the poor Negro
masses are really for WILLIAMS and for his kind of
radical strugge. WEISSMAN stated that herein lies the
struggle of the NAACP, that of the Negro massés against
the vourgeois leadership which the Party could take part.

NY T-2 on July 24, 1959, advised that a
meeting of the SWP, New York local was held on July 16, 1959,
at 116 University Place, New York City. Assignments
were made at the meeting for coverage d& the NAACP Convention
at which comrades would-sell issues of “The Militant".

of the NAACP in regard to integration and cuvil rights
struggles generally. WEINSTEIN reported that he would
be attending the NAACP Convention and the big question
at the Convention would be the ROBERT WILLIAMS case.

an SWP member, described the work of the comrades in the
SWP in Chicago where there is a great struggle against the
NAACP leadership in which the rank and file had to form
an independent organization after being dissdived by the
NAACP Bureaucrats. He stated tnat the attemt to make this
independent group the regular NAACP branch for Chicago
failed after the NAACP ordered tne group to dissdive and in
the voting the regular NAACP won only through dishonest
means. Di BRUCE stated that attempts to get delegates
from the independent group to the NAACP Convention failed
also through dishonest means. He stated that the
independents planned. togo to New York and present their
cease before the Convention.

that there has been a great increase in the opportunities in the
various branches in the Negro struggle and that there
was evidence of the development of a left-wing within
the NAACP nationally.

the SWP Convention that during the Negro Panel session,
all speakers condemned the present conservative approach
of the NAACP and that the Party urged all to voice opposition
and work to move the NAACP to the left in its work in the
Negro community. It was announced that activity in the
NAACP was strong and every delegation apparently has
a member in the NAACP, It was ried that ROBZRT WILLIAMS'
Stand that Negroes should defend themselves by violent

there were about 45 persons present at the meeting which
had been called under the sponsorship of the Brooklyn
NAACP Branch,

The opening speech was made by TED POSTON” who
spoke of his own knowledge of the Willie Reid case and the
methods of Florida justice, He urged everyone to get
behind the campaign to prevent WILLT. EID from being
extradited..to Florida where he can only @xpect certain
death because he had incurred the emnity of the sheriff,
the legal officer who began the extradition proceedings.

One of the lawyers who is representating WILLIE
REID, gave most of the details of the case. WILLIE REID
had been arrested in a gambling house which was well
known for its dishonesty. He was winning when a fight
broke out in which WILLIE defended himself with a knife.
He was arrested and tried in less than five minutes without
benefit of counsel. Florida law provides a penalty of
one year for the crime he should have been tried for.
However, he was charged instead with assault with intent
to kill which carries a penalty of fifteen years. According
to the attorney, REID was sentenced to the chain gang
and after serving two years escaped and came to New York,
Extradition proceedings are now being brought against

‘him.

The informant stated that GEORGE WEISSMAN spoke
as the Secretary of the Defense Committee and told of plans
for the petition drive. He gave out petitions and urged
everyone to get not only signatures but also money
contributions which are needed for the legal fees and for
publicity to build the committee. WEISSMAN stated that the
committee would meet again for mass distribution in Brooklyn.

According to NY 72, the Willie Reid Defense Committee’
was formed by the Brooklyn NAACP Branch, however, two
members of the New York Local, SWP, had been influential in the

~29-



NY 100-7629

formation of the committee and actually were its driving
force, The informant stated that it was his opinion
that the SWP in New York hopedto utilize the committee
as a propaganda outlet for its own aims and purposes,

The informant stated that'practically all of the
work done in attempting to obtain signatures for the
petitions was carried out by various members of the
New York Local, SWP. He added, however, that the campaign

"never caught fire" inasmuch as it was later found to be
extremely difficult to talk a person. into contributing
or signing a petition in behalf of WILLIE REID. ‘This
public apathy, according to the informant, was based
primarily on the fact that the WILLIE REID case was not
strong enough due to the fact that REID had actually
committed a crime and there was no death penalty involved.

NY T-2, on October 28, 1959, advised that the
SWP, New York Local, held a class in Marxist studies on
October 18, 1959, in Brooklyn, New York, The informant
advised that the class was conducted by NAT WEINSTEIN, -’
The informant also stated that the class was conducted under
the auspices of the SWP for contacts,particularly Negroes,
in the Brooklyn area, especially those in and around
the Brooklyn NAACP Branch. The informant advised that
the class was viewed by the SWP, New York Local, as the
pasis for a future branch in Brooklyn. The space for the
class was rented by LEO-ABLER as living quarters for Comrade
LEO and the cost for the space would be born by Comrade
LEO and the Party. However, it was expected that those
attending the class would be contributing 50¢ a session
which money, along with the money from Comrade LEO, would
more than pay for the rent.

(LEL) in Brooklyn, New York:

The LEL in Brooklyn, New York, is the brain child
of NAT WEINSTEIN which resulted from WEINSTEIN's activities
within the Labor Ccmmittee of the Brooklyn NAACP Branch.
Various contacts of WEINSTEIN for example, JULIUS and

MATTIE-GARTER within the Labor Committee of the Brooklyn
NAACP, have to date, been tnwilling to join the SYP,
however, they expressed a willingness to participate
in socialist discussions and classes.

As a result of the above, WEINSTEIN initiated
a series of soclatst economic classes consisting of ~
a four to five week course based on Marxist pamphlets. In
the process of this class. attended by WEINSTEIN's
contacts within the Brooklyn NAACP and several SWP members
in New York City, an Executive Committee was formed. The
Pr elected to this committee were not. hhenbers
of the-SWP. and udupted’ the name, LEL. ° 7 peaEnae

The SWP exercises control of the LEL through
NAT WEINSTEIN inasmuch as he has considerable influence
among individuals within the LEL who consistently adhere
to his ideas and suggestions. The SWP also exercises
control through approximately five SWP members who are
also in the LEL. The SWP also exerts. influence through
the speakers at the classes and courses held thus far
namely, NAT WRINSTEIN and TOM KERRY. 2;

Aut

The SWP at the current time, is hopeful that the
LEL will develop- in the futureintothe Brooklyn Branch
of the SWP. The SWP considers that the formation of the LEL.
is the first big break through by the SWP into the Negro
community in the New York City area.

on April 17, 1959, a source advised that on
February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers party (SWP) minority
group, under the leadership of National Committee member
on Ballan, known in the SWP as Sam Marcy, split from the
. ,

The source stated that this minority group, re-
ferred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program
and policy differences or ‘varied issues concerning tactics
and interpretation of political events, split from the
SWP an the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself
by departing from the Marxist precepts of Leon Trotsky and
retreating from the fight for the world socialist revolu-
tions. The final issue which ultimately forced the split
was the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment policy
which involved cooperation with the Communist Party (CP)
periphery - individuals characterized by the minority as
petty-bourgeois,

The minority program, according to the source, ad-
vocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and
has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with
a complete proletarian orientation for the purgose of over-~
Nenesh pet capitalism in the United States and throughout the
world,

On June 10, 1959, the source advised that this mi-
nority group had chosen the name Workers World Party with
headquarters located at 46 West 2lst Street, New York, New
York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States pursuant to Executive

CPUSA -- pursuing its stated objectives,
presents "a clear and present danger to

subversive Activities Control Board, es-
tablished by Section 791 of the above Act,
found the CPUSA to be a communist action
organization. This finding was upheld by
the United States Supreme Court in June,
1961. The CPUSA has continued to be an
arm of the international communist move-
ment dominated by the Soviet Union. The
CPUSA, in its dependence on the Soviet.
Union, has never knowingly adopted a
position contrary to Soviet policy. Its
“leaders frequently confer with Soviet
-leaders to receive guidance and direction
‘on the policies the CPUSA is to follow.

aims of the CPUSA as they, conform to Soviet
objectives, have changed over the years.

Soviet Anbassador in Washington, D.C. Among the progressive
Jewish organizations protesting were the Jewish Cultural Clubs
and Societies (JCCS), the "Morning Freiheit", the ELF, "Jewish
Currents" and others.

The protest was in the form of telegram asking the
Ambassador to ask the government of the Soviet Union to nullify
the death sentences and to lessen the jail sentences of the
other Jewish defendants. The telegram pointed out that the
extremity cf the sentences “has astounded many supporters of
peace, coexistence and socialism. This made possible the
intensification of anti-Soviet agitation among many of those
people who want to worsen relations between the Soviet Union
and the United States."

The protest was sent to the sponsors of the
show. I: the protest, Mrs, LEAH NELSON, pressoche of ELF
stated the following:

"In the early fifties, when this film was first
- presented, we protested its showing due to portrayal of the
anti-Semitic character Fagin, and its brutality.

"To repeat the showing of this film in 1970
is an insult to all Americans for in addition to its anti- i
Semitic character it tends to encourage thé crimes of mugging, E
pickpocketing and even murder in our communities. We call ‘i
upon you to withdraw your sponsorship of this film and i
hope that it will not be repeated.”

BLACK PANTHER PARTY a G

. Also Known As
Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

; According to its official newspaper, the Black
Panther Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in

take control of the life, politics and the destiny of the
black community. It was organized by BOBBY SEALE, BPP
Chairman, and HUEY P, NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense,
NEWTON was sentenced in 1968 to serve 2 to 15 years after
being convicted of manslaughter in connection with the
killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther", which
further déscribes itself as the "Black Community News Service",
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
‘tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

. black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed,

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,
contains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE
MASON MURRAY, which ends with the following:

| "Black men. Black people, colored persons of |
America, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom
everywhere, Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun, Kill the
pigs everywhere. u

: Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement, "we will not dissent from American Government,

We Will overthrow it."

quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the -
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
eee power grows out of the barrel of a gun,"

: The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

JEWISH CULTURAL CLUBS
AND SOCIETIES

A source advised on April 27, 1954, that the
former leaders, including GEDALIA SANDLER, Executive Secretary
of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO), Jewish nationality
section of the International Workers Order (IWO), had established
& committee at 1133 Broadway, New York, New York. Through this
committee they were organizing cultural clubs and societies
-based on JP¥O ledges which had been dissolved on December 15,
1953, in the ccurse of proceedings by the New York State
authorities culmination in the liquidation of the 1W0,

‘ A second source advised on March 15, 1961, that
a meeting of the National Groups Commission of the Communist
Party, United States of America (CP, USA), was held on Marca
2, 1961, in New York City. GEDALIA SANDLER was among those
present and spoke of his experiences in maintaining the Jewish
lodges after the dissoiution of the IWO, which to avoid
prosecution, have no national name or organization..

SANDLER stated that these lodges "lived" as clubs
and societies by maintaining their cultural, fraternai and :
civic activities, but which activities are less political 7

_ than in the former lodges. New York gave leadership to the
rest of the country since the New York lédges were the strongest
and had the more politically developed comrades.

On March 6, 1869, SANDLER addressed over two hundred
leaders of the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies (JCCS), at
a meeting in New York City, according to the "Morning Freiheit",
‘ of March 17, 1989. SANDLER spoke of the diverse cultural work
: of the clubs. He discussed the war in Vietnam and said that
: it appears that the peace demonstrations will be renewed. The
JCCS will. participate in them.

A third source advised on July 8, 1969, that the
JCCS is located at Room 1429, 1133 Broadway, New York City.

and the other Jewish organizations to continue their operations
without the MF "which mobilizes the masses for their campaigns,
activities and affairs. In this field it is definitely, the
dynamo, the cement, the organizer, the mobilizer, just as it is
their ideological pathfinder." N

protests, conferences and by electing representatives to the
Congress, Senate and other institutions." NELSON concluded

EPSTEIN stated the EL was paying homage to EMMA .-
LAZARUS, the champion of justice and equality. We try to
implement our program to this cnampion. To safeguard liberty
and Jewish-Black unity are the orders of the day. We will

~

fight for justice for all people. We must end the unconstitutional

war in Vietnam", She mentioned the ELF helping financially
_ the black hospital workers in Soutn Carolina. :

“ The first speaker was BARBARA COLTON ot tne

American Jewish Congress. COLTON stated her inspiration
was the March on-Wasnington in 1963, when she found her
idéntity as a Jew. She stated that toaay Jews must involve
themsélves in good relationships between Jews and blacks in
all communities. This Jewish-Black relationsnip is being
strained today with tne rise of black anti-Semitism. This
has come about because of Jewish landlords in the ghettos
and the number of Jewisn teachers. She claimed Negroes are
basically Christians and “anti-Semitism is a aisease of
Christianity". She stated black power is a search for pride
and identity. 7 : me not

The next speaker was FRANKLIN GRAHAM, a Negro,
Director of Housing of the New York City Commission on Human
Rights. He told the audience “we must build a good society
where blacks and whites can move together with dignity".

He stated it is strange while white Americans wish
to give treedom to the world, here in Amerita they retuse
. to give it to black Americans. He claimed if we cannot
live: together we will all perish together and black racism
will not be stopped until racism is taken out of our society.

ROSE RAYNES was the last speaker. She said the
. ELF is against anti-Semitism, racism and the war in Vietnam.
According to RAYNES, the ELF presented 60,000 signatures to
the United States Senate urging this government to ratify
the United Nations resolution against genocide. She stated
the ELF has been in picket lines to support the black hospital
workers in South Carolina. In addition, she urged the audience
to present themselves on a picket line on June 2h, 1969, at
the West German Consulate, New York City, to protest West
Germany Statute of Limitations against trying German war
criminals. The ceremony ended at 3:25 p.m.

: ‘The ELF ‘joined a number of organizations such as
the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies, tne Yiddisher
Kultur Farband, and the "Morning Freineit", in sending a
statement to the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C., to
the Polish Mission at the United Nations, to the Communist
parties in the European Socialist States ana to the Communist
parties in Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere.

The statement criticized tne government of Poland
for its anti-Zionist campaign with anti-Jewish connotations.
It stated. in Poland, Jews are identified with Zionism. In
addition, too harsh a stand is taken with regard to small
offenses by people of Jewish extraction, offenses of a Kind
that is often overlooked in others,

The stetement pointed out Jews are "given exit permits
to go to Israel only so that the records show the emigrants
want to go to Israel only, even if they wish to go to other
countries. It went on to show how the leading Jewish actress
in Poland, due to the anti-Jewish climate and discrimination,
left Poland. The statement concluded as follows:

"A thousand years ago Poland extended hospitality
to the persecuted Jews of Germany and other European countries.
Now, leaders of Poland have brought matters to a point where
a thousand years of Jewish life in Poland may be approaching
its end. We urge that this tragedy be averted and that Poland
be set again upon the course of a truly socialist and humanist

AMERICAN ASSOCIATION TO COMBAT
FASCISM AND RACISM.

A source advised on January 25; 1960, that a meeting
was sponsored by "The Worker", an east coast Communist newspaper,
on January 24, 1960, at the Park Plaza, New York City. EVELYN
WIENER, described by the source as the Chairman of the New York
County Communist Party (CP), invited the audience to attend a
protest meeting to be held in Union Square, New York City, on
January 26, 1960, to protest anti-Semitism in West Germany.

A second source, on January 26, 1960, advised that
the CP had prepared 6,000 leaflets in connection with anti-
Semitism te be distributed at a rally to be held that day at
Union Square, New York City. These leaflets, according to the
source, were not distributed since the CP was not openly
represented at the meeting. However, according to the source,
known Communists participated openly in the meeting.

On September 13, 1961, a Special Agent of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, by means of a suitable pretext, spoke

to SAM PEV2NER, who stated that he is the public relations
officer of the Committee Against Nazism and Anti-Semitism.

He stated that the organization initially known as the Committee
to Stop the Revival of Nazism and Anti-Semitism, originated

SERVICE BUREAU OF JEWISH EDUCATION

On March 12, 1953, a source made available a
pamphlet captioned, "Questions and Answers About the
Progressive Jewish Childrens Schools", which states that
for more than 20 years the children's sthools of the
Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) constituted the
progressive wing of secular Jewish education.

On March 17, 1951, another source reported that as
of January 17, 1951, the school system of the JPFO was then
known as the Committee for Progressive Jewish Education
(CPJE), the former name being the National School and
Cultural Commission of the JPFO, :

On September 14, 1955, the second source,
mentioned above, advised that on the afternoon of September 13,
1955, the CPJE acceded to the demands of the New York State
Department of Insurance as liquidator of the International .
Workers Order (INO) that the CPJE surrender itself to the
State as an asset of the IWO. The State, on that date,
took control and closed the office of the CPJE located in
Room 903, 160 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

: On January 23, 1956, a third source made available
a letter of the Service Bureau of Jewish Education (SBJE),
Room 1005, 1123 Broadway, New York City, dated January 19,
1956, which reflected that although "to a cartain extent,
the attacks on our schools paralyzed our normal contact with
you", the SBJE established its own office, opened and is
+ serving all progressive Jewish children's schools.

A fourth source advised on May 17, 1968, that
. courses in the various progressive children's schools
serviced by the SBJE are taught with a Marxist-Socialist
philosophy and the SBJE is dominated by the Communist
Party (CP) inasmuch as most of the SBJE leadership, as
well as many of the school teachers, are either CP members
or supporters of the CP.

7 The current Borough of Manhattan (New Yoriccity)
Telephone Directory reflects the address vf the SBIE as
1123 Broadway, New York City.

Resolutions were adopted at the convention on
peace, the Middle East and Civil Rights. Some resolutions

- were not completed at the convention and were to be resolved

by circularizing them among the clubs for discussion. Included
in these resolutions to be so handled were’ community
work, cultural work and anti-Semitism.

In regard to the Anti-Semitism Resolution, EVA.
“MAMBER, former National Vice-President and a member of
the Boston delegation, during the early stages of the
convention, and not on the convention floor, fought for a
resolution condemning the Soviet Union and their support of
the Arab nations in the Israeli-Arab Crisis. MAMBER also
wanted the convention to condemn the Soviet Union for anti-
Semitism in the Soviet Union. Since this resolution was not
in final form, it was sent back to the committee for further
editing and was to be circulated later to the ELF Districts
and Clubs. MAMBER was the only National officer who was not
re-elected at the convention. . :

ILSON paid tribute to EMMA LAZARUS and read a
verse from her sonnet "The New Colossus", ;

ILSON introduced WILLIAM F. "KUNSTLER as an
attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in the
civil rights field. KUNSTLER stated that the Negro has
reached a period in the United States when he is unable to
get any of his rights, and because of this, the Negro is ~
now prepared to do what the Israelis have done in the Sinai
Desert - some will call it a rebellion. He stated that the
Statue of Liberty has faced the open sea to greet new

_ immigrants to the American shore since the turn of the
century. The Negro has always faced the back of the Statue
and has asked why were the immigrants coming here. The Negro
was brought here in slavery while the immigrant chose this
land for freedom. The Negro has been in a bondage worse
than that of the Israelites, the Negro being forcefully
separated from his wife and children.

He stated the Negro has a rocky road to climb
by himself, without the aid of the whites and wishes to
breathe freely in the eyes of the other people.

KUNSTLER stated the Statue should no longer
face the sea. It should be turned around to face the
poenerys to shine on the ghettos: of Detroit, Chicago, and

atts. :

The Americans, according to him, bear an eternal
sear and stigma, and must all atone for the enslavement of
the Negro. His enslavement has no equal, whether it would
have been under a czar or Hitler. The African boy wonders
whether it would have been better for him to die in the Nazi
ovens or better to suffer a lifetime as a Negro in the South.

ILSOoN introduced JACK O'DELL as the Associate
Editor of "Freedomways" magazine. O'DELL stated he had not
known of the deeds‘of EMMA LAZARUS until he read the ELF
book “Emma Lazarus - Woman with a Torch"

He related that over a decade has passed since
her death and her teachings go unheeded. Racism, genocide,
and colonial exploitation are still practiced. He stated
that 400,000 people marched on April 15, and the Govern-
ment responded by escalating the war in Vietnam. There
should be an end to the bombing of Vietnamese women and
children. The Government should stop plotting the overthrow
of so-called unfriendly nations. He concluded by °
stating that the American people must rededicate themselves
to the principles which EMMA LAZARUS lived for.

of the resolution was sent to the United States Ambassador

The resolution states that, in the name of the
thousands of Jewish women, they appeal that all possible steps
be taken to immediately stop the blood-spilling in the
Middle East and not to permit the destruction of Israel.

The resoJution points out that most of the inhabitants of

is to be permitted to live in a world at peace.’ The masses
in Israel, the resolution states, just as the masses in the
Arab states, want to live in peace with each other, and that

A source advised on April 27, 1954, that the former
leaders, including GEDALIA SANDLER, Executive Secretary of the
Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO), Jewish nationality

oi section of the International Yorkers Order (10), had

established a committee at 1153 Broadway, New York, New York.
Through this committee they were brcanieine cultural clubs
and societies based on JPFO lodges which had been dissolved
on December 15, 1953, in the course of proceedinss by the
New York State authorities citiminating in the liquidation of
the Io,

A second source advised on March 15, 1961, that a
meeting of the National Groups Commission cf the Communist
Party, United States of America (CP, USA) was held on March

avoid prosecution, have no national name or organization.

i
}

SANDLER stated that these lodges "lived" as clubs and
societies by maintaining their cultural, fraternal and civic
activities, but which activities are less political than -in
the former lodges, New York gave leadership to the rest of
the country since the New York lodges were the strongest and
had the more politically develoned comrades.

These clubs and societies still maintain a medical
plan, funeral benefits and mutual aid funds. There are about
132 clubs and societies nationally, 63,of which are located
in New York City.

APPENDIX
a
SERVICE BUREAU OF JEWISH EDUCATION

On March 12, 1953, a source made available a
pamphlet captioned, "Questions and Answers About the Progressive
Jewish Children's Schools", which states that for more than 7
20 years the children's schools of the Jewish People's
Fraternal Order (JPFO) constituted the progressive wing of
secular Jewish education.

On March 17, 1951, another source reported that
as of January 17, 1951, the school system of the JPFO was
then known as the Committee for Progressive Jewish Education
(CPJE), the former name beingthe National School and Cultural
Commission of the JPFO.

On September 14, 1955, the second source,
mentioned above,advised that on the afternoon of September 13,

NW 55136 DocId:32989572 Page 1568

1955, the CPJE acceded to the demands of the New York State
Department of Insurance as liquidator of the International
Workers Order (IWO) that the CPJE surrender itself to the State
as an asset of the IWO. The State, on that date, took control
and closed the office of the CPJE located in Room 903, 160
Fifth Avenue, New York City.

on January 23, 1956, a third source made
available a letter of the Service Bureau of dewish Education
(SBJE), Room 1005, 1123 Broadway, New York City, dated January
19, 1956, which reflected that although "to a certain extent,
+ the attacks on our schools paralyzed our normal contact with
you", the SBJE established its own office, opened and is
serving all progressive Jewish children's schools.

A fourth source advised on Mav 15, 1967, that courses
in the various progressive children's schools serviced by the
SBJE are taught with a Marxist-Socialist philosophy and the SBJE
is dominated by the Communist Party (CP) inasmuch as most of the
SBJE leadership, as well as many of the school teachers, are
either CP members or supporters of the CP.

The current Borough of Manhattan (New York City,)
Telephone Directory reflects the address of the SBJE as 1123
. Broadway , New York City.

The JPFO, the ‘Jewish Nationality Section of
the IWO, and the IWO have been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450,

III. ATMS AND OBJECTIVES

The August-September, 1966 issue of "Yiddishe
Kultur" carried an article by JUNE GORDON regarding the
cultural contributions of the ELF, GORDON stated that the
ELF came into being in 1951 when it was felt that culture could
become an important weapon against the struggle of Nazism and
anti-Semitism, It was also believed that the humanism in
Jewish culture and the experience gained in the hundreds of
years of struggle to retain their Jewish heritage, could, if
they joined with the Negro people and others in their fight
for peace and freedom, make an added contribution to Jewish
culture and the culture of others.

’ AMERICAN NAZI PARTY OF THE
WORLD UNION OF FREE ENTERPRISE
NATIONAL SOCIALISTS, Also Known
As The George Lincoln
Rockwell Party”

In his book "This Time The World", copyrighted in
1961, GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL identified himself as
Commander, American Nazi Party of the World Union of Free
Enterprise National Socialists (ANP - WUFENS), Arlington,
Virginia,

The April 4, 1963, issue of "The Richmond News
Leader", a Richmond, Virginia, daily newspaper, reported that
GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL had, on the previous day, again
appiied for the American Nazi Party to be chartered in the
State of Virginia, but this request was turned down by the
Virginia State Corporation Commission. This action was
taken pursuant to an act of the 1962 Virginia Assembly -
which prohibits use of "Nazi" or "National Socialism" in a
Virginia charter. This article further pointed out that
ROCKWELL's Party is presently chartered in the State of
Virginia as the George Lincoln Rockwell Party.

On August 14, 1964, a source acvised that the ANP -
WUFENS was organized by GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL at his
residence in Arlington, Virginia, on February 26, 1959, as an
international "National Socialist" movement based on the
German Nazi Party headed by ADOLF HITLER. He added that
ROCKWLLL is the dominant force and personality in this party;
that he is espousing a "line" of hatred against Jews and
Negroes; and that he is seeking, through sneeches,
. distribution of literature and picketing, to establish a
cohesive and dominant political party in the United States
and in foreign countries.

According to the "Stormtrooper's Manual", an
official publication of the ANP, the phases of ANP struggle

for power are fourfold, namely, first, "to make ourselves
known to the masses"; second, "the dissemination of our

“program and truth about the Party";-third, "organizing the
Teople who have been converted to our propaganda"; and
fourth, "the attainment of power through the votes of the
newly-won masses",

On August 19, 1966, the source advised that GEORGE -
LINCOLN ROCKWELL presently believes that he has completed
the first two phases in his struggle for power and is well
into the third stage, to wit, "the organizing of the people
who have been converted to our propaganda”. The,source added
that ROCKWELL had previously believed that he would be
“elected Governor of Virginia in November, 1965, and when
defeated, he made the statement that he was not ready for
stage four.

discrimination at home.

International Treaty which the General Assembly recently
passed, appoints commissions and tribunals in member
nations to act on charges of racial discrimination. The
second aim of the meeting was to request United States
Senate approval of the.Genocide Treaty, which declares
as an international crime the annihilation of nations.
The United States Delegates to the United Nations voted in

ROSE NELSON RAYNES, Chairlady, paid tribute to
EMMA LAZARUS as a crusader for the rights of Jews and of
all people. She stated the issues today are peace, good
housing, and civil rights; and called for a negotiated peace
in Vietnam to"bring our boys home now", She also asked that
Congress adopt the United Nations resolution calling for an
end to all forms of racial discrimination in this country
and throuzhout the world. RAYNES stated that the ELF
hac collected 5,000 signatures on petitions calling for
the ratificiation of the resolution. These petitions would
eventually be presented to United States Ambassador to
the United Nations, ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG,

t RAYNES introduced as guest speaker Dr. GRACE
JAMES, a pediatrician specializing in mental health
emotional retardation. Dr. JAMES has practiced in
Loussville, Kentucky, and was active in the civil rights
movement there. She has been attending the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine of the Yeshiva University in New_York,
and will be returning to Kentucky. :

Dr. JAMES mentioned she had attended the recent
White House Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C.,
and was pleased with the intentions of the President in
. holding the conference, Dr. JAMES spoke briefly of the
social changes. brought about over the years through the
efforts of women. She stated that Jews broke away from
the ghettos of Europe to come to this country of th®ir
own volition and were abie to keep their families together,
while Negro families were broken up by their slave owners
and live in American ghettos. This brought about the
unstable condition that exists in the Negro family. All
responsibilities are left to the Negro mother, who must
.not only take care of the home, but must also go to work
to support her children. Loneliness causes the Negro woman
to gamble, drink, and at time to become promiscuous. :

Dr. JAMES called upon all present on the occasion
to reach out arid help others regardless of their race and
creed, She stated that they have a challenge to fulfill
the rights granted in the Civil Rights laws that were enacted
by Congress, since these are the rights of all Americans.

RAYNES introduced LEAH NELSON as National President
of the ELF, NELSON stated that on May 17, 1966, the ELF
had received engraved invitations for her as National
President and for MOLLIE ILSON as the Civil Rights Director
of the ELF, to attend the White House Conference on Civil
Rights in Washington, D.C. on June 1-2, 1966. NELSON spoke
of the proceedings of the conference and was critical of
the fact that no commitments were made as to how mich would
be spent to carry out a program. She stated that she and
ILSON attended the workshop of the Committee for Administrative
Justice, where ILSON called for the ratificiation of the
United Nations resolution against racial discrimination.

NELSON stated that ILSON had introduced a resolution
on the revision of textbooks in public schools, since
Negro and Puerto Rican children do not leaynof their
heritage through the present books. ILSON also called
for the establishment of 2 thousand Day Gare Centers
throughout the country for Negro children.

NELSON felt that the role played by the EL¥ at
the conference was significant. They were disappointed
that no reports of their. efforts aa press.

RAYNES introduced CHARLES y LLEN, JR. as a
journalist and author of whe book, "Nazi War Criminals
Among Us", ALLEN spoke briefly of the significance of
the Statue of Liberty and what it means to the Negro, the
Jew and the white person. He called the riots in the
Watts section of Los Angeles, in Philadelphia, and in
Harlem, New York, general insurrections against discrimination.

’ He asked for an end to all ghettos and second class citizen~
“ ship for Negroes.

- ALLEN quoted a statement of JAMES MEREDITH that
MEREDITH will be armed the next time he goes to Mississippi.
He stated its too bad that people don't like to hear this,
but this is the way 1t will have to be. He stated EMMA
LAZARUS would have aligned herself with those in the
stmuggle for civil rights and peace. He further stated
that people are getting sick and tired of President JOHNSON's
policy in Vietnam. ‘The people intend to use the polls
to express their dissatisfaction.

The affair ended at 3:10 p.m. with the singing
of "We Shall Overcome", About 250 people were in attendance,
the majority of whom were elderly women. ‘The group was

W.E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source has advised that. on October 26-27,
1963, a conference of members of the Communist Party (CP),
including national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois,
for the purpose of settling in motion forces for the
a establishment of a new national Marxist-oriented youth

organization which would hunt for the most peaceful
transition to socialism. These delegates were told that

’ it would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists
attracted into this new organization would eventually pass
into the CP itself.

A second source has advised that the founding
convention for the new youth organization was held from
dune 19-21, 1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco,
California, at which time the name W. E. B. DuBois Clubs
of America (DCA) was adopted. Approximately 500 delegates
from throughout the United States attended this convention.
The aims of this organization, as set forth in the preamble
to the constitution are, "It is our belief that this nation
can best solve its problems in an atmosphere of peaceful
coexistence, complete disarmament and true freedom for
all peoples of the world, and that these solutions will be
reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic
elements in our country, composed esseritially of the
working people allied in the unity of Negroes and other
minorities with whites. We further fully recognize that
the greatest threat to American democracy comes from the 7
racist and right wing forces in coalition with the most FE
reactionary sections of the economic power structure,
using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy
the unified struggle of. the working people."

_ Over the Labor Day weekend, 1965, the DCA held
a conference in Chicago, Illinois, and a new slate of
officers was elected to the National Executive Committee
(NEC) of the DCA. Since Labor Day, 1965, identities of
those serving on the NEC has varied; however, according
to a third source as of May, 1966, thirteen of the fifteen

members of the NEC were members of the CP in the San Francisco
Bay area. :

A confidential source advised on March 29, 1965, that
the Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF) , formerly known as the
Anti-Fascist Youth Committee, was established by the
Workers World Party (WNP) in the summer of 1962, to bring
college and high'school youth into the periphery of WNP
activities and thereby gain recruits for the organization.

A second confidential source advised on October 23,
1964, that a flyer distributed by the YAWF describes that
organization as a militant organization of young workers and
worker-~students for combating war and fascism.

The first source advised on March 9, 1966, that
the YAWF maintains its headquarters at 58 West 25th Street,

The committee finds that the Emergency

means of funds and legal aid, Communists
involved in Smith Act violations end
similar legal proceedings. One of its
chief activities has been and still is
the dissemination of voluminous poms t
propaganda material.'

'PRANK WILKINSON was called as a aaee

when he appeared in.Atlanta as a represent-

Committee to propagandize against the
Committee on Un-American Activities and

to protest its hearings. In 1956 WILKINSON
was identified as a Communist Party member by a

Summoned at that time to answer the allegation,
his reply to all questions was, "I am -

This also became his stock reply to questions

JEWISH CULTURAL CLUBS AND SOCIETIES

A source advised on April 27, 1954, that the former:
leaders, including GEDALIA SANDLER, Executive Secrétary, of .
the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO), Jewish nationality
section of the International Worxers Order (IWO)-had
established a committee at 1133 Broadwey, New York, New
York. Through this committee they were organizing cultural
Clubs and societies based on JPFO lodges which had been
dissolved on December 15, 1953, in the course of procesdings
by the New York State authorities culminating in the

. liquidation of the IWO.

A second source advised on March-15, 1961 that a
meeting of the National Groups Commission of the Communist
Party, United States of America, was held on March 2, 1961,
in New York City. GEDALIA SANDLER was among those
and spoke of his experiences in maintaining the 3
lodges after the dissolution of the IWO, which, to av
prosecution, have no national name or organization.

acer aeraNre

SANDIER stated that these lodges "lived" as ciubs
and.societies by maintaining their cultural, fraternal and
civic activities, but which activities are less political
than in the former lodges. New York gave leadership to the
rest of the country since the New York lodges were the strangest
and had the more politically developed comrades.

These clubs and societies still maintain a medleat

plan, funeral benefits and mutual aid funds. There are 132

_ Clubs and societies nationally, 63 of which are located in
New York City. :

’ . A third source furnished information on May 18, 1965
that the clubs and societies are located at 1133 Broadway,
Room 1429, New York, New York, under the name of the Jewish
Program Service Committee, but are more widely known as
the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies.

The IWO and the JPFO have been designated

On March 12, 1953, a source made available a
pamphlet captioned, "Questions and Answers About The
Progressive Jewish Children's Schools," which states
that for more than twenty years the children's schools
of the Jewish People‘s Fraternal Order (JPFO) constituted
the progressive wing of secular Jewish education.

. On March 17, 1951, another source reported that
as of January-.17, 1951, the school system of the JPFO was
then knew as the Committee for Progressive Jewish
Education (CPJE), the former name being the National
School and Cultural Commission of the JPFO.

On September 14, 1955, the second source, mentioned
above, advised that on the afternoon of September 13, 1955, —
the CPJE acceded to the demands of the New York State Depart-
ment of Insurance as liquidator of the International Workers
Order (IWO) that the CPJE surrender itself to the State as
an asset of the IWO. The State, on that date, took control

"and closed the office of the CPJE located in Room 903, 160
Fifth Avenue, New York City.

On January 23, 1956, a third source made available
- ,a letter of the Service Bureau of Jewish Education (SBJE),
Room 1005, 1123 Broadway, New York City, dated January 19,
1956, .which reflected that although "to a certain extent,

the attacks on our schools paralyzed our normal- contact %
with you," the SBJE established its own office, opened and H
is serving all progressive Jewish children's schools. if

A fourth source advised on May 14, 1964, that i
courses in the various progressive children's schools &
serviced by the SBJE are taught with a Marxist-Socialist u

philosophy and the SBJE is dominated by the Communist
Party (CP) inasmuch as most of the SBJE leadership, as
well as many of the school teachers, are either CP members
or supporters“of the CP. Geers

“The Jewish Fratérnalist" dated October, 1947,
self identified as the official publication of the Jewish
People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) of the International
Workers Order (IWO), on page 6, contained an article
which reflected that the Emma Lazarus Division (ELD) of
the JPFO was to hold its first national convention in New
York City on November 15 and 16, 1947, after having been
first established at a National,Women's Conference called
three years previously by the JPFO.

The "Morning Freiheit" on January 25, 1951,
contained a report on the National Convention of the
ELD of the JPFO which took place in New York City on
January 20 and 21, 1951. At this .convention it was noted
that the ELD changed its name to Emma Lazarus Federation =
of Jewish Women's Clubs (ELF) and adopted a new constitution.

On May 11, 1961, a source advised that the ELF is
one of several mass organizations comprising the Jewish cultural
progressive movement. JUNE GORDON, ELF Executive Director,
who is a member of the New York State Communist Party (CP)
Board and Committee, is the leading force in the organization,

peace and interested in protecting the rights of the foreign
born. It is against the BEN GURION Government of Israel,
bomb testing, anti-Semitism, Negro discrimination, and the
rearmament of West Germany.

The source related that the ELF renders support
to and receives support from the “Morning Freiheit” and
any other Jewish progressive organizations.

The source also stated that the ELF is recognized
by the CP, USA as an important progressive national
organization of women.

The address of the national office of the ELF is 160

JEWISH PROGRAM SERVICE COMMITTEE

A source advised in April, 1954, that the former
leaders of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO),
Jewish nationality section of the International Workers
Order (IWO), had established the Jewish Publication and
Research Committee (JPRC). Through this committee they
were organizing cultural clubs and societies based on
JPFO Lodges which had been dissolved on December 15, 1953,
in the course of proceedings by the New York State
authorities culminating in the liquidation of the IWO.

The above source on April 27, 1955, advised that
New York area clubs and societies of the JPRC were divided
into four districts, Bronx, Manhattan, East Brooklyn and
West Brooklyn, with each district having a district
coordinating committee which in turn are represented on
the General Coordinating Committee of Jewish Clubs and r
Societies (GCC).
