CP EFFORTS TO INFILTRATE NAACP

CONVENTION

NY T-1 on May 11, 1962, advised that a

meeting of part of the CP,

USA National Negro

Commission was held on May 5, 1962, at the Chelsea

The major portion of this

meeting was devoted to ciscussing matters pertainine

to the NAACP and of the coming convention of the NAACP.

The main report was given Dy TED BASSETT, Who recapped

some of the problems in the NAACP.

BASSETT noted

the failure of the Party to take

advantage of the

many situations that have been presented by virtue

of the struggles that have taken place.

He said

that one of .

the problems that the NAACP has, with

-2-

## Page 9

NY 100-7629

regard to the Atlanta convention, is the matter of

discrimination in the hotels.

He stated that

the peupis in Atlanta will permit desegregatio:

of the hotels during the NAACP convention, but

both before and aíter the convention will not

make a change in the segregation policy.

In other

words,

ine segregation will be lifted while the

convention is ning on and delegates to the

conventiji can lave all

the privileges of the

hotel.

Next BASSETT recapped the developments in

civil righss by the NAACP since 1952. He indicated

that the NAACP national policy has been to serve as

a brake on the ageressive tendencies of the member-

ship.

This tendency has been evidenced in the

resolutions submitted at the previous conventions.

Now the NAACP leadership finds itself in a position

in which they have to examine this situation.

BASSETT brought out the fact that directives have

been issued by the National Office of the NAACP

which only give lip service to the resolutions

submitted to and accepted by the convention.

He

said that they never put themselves in a position

in which they could be charged with not doing what

the convention passes on, but they do it in such

a way that it is ineffective.

He cited as an

example the fact that the last convention had

called for the issuance of an emancipation

proclamation and noted that such a proclamation

was issued, but it was a watered-down version.

BASSETT further mentioned that the youth

had been able to win some concessions in 1960, but

were not nearly so successful in the 1961 convention.

He stated that 2,000 delegates were

expected to attend the 1902 convention and that

the theme of the 1962 convention would be

the

fight for the ballot and for job opportunities.

During the discussion on the NAACP Convention,

It was brought out that the Party finds itself

in the

same situation that it was in last year,

prior to the convention.

that is, that the Party

Iorces have not gotten together and, therefore,

the Party must operate at the coming convention

without the cooperation and cooräination necessary

to effectively influence the convention.

The Informant reported that WILLIAM

PATTERSON spoke and in his remarks indicated that

there is a crisis in the Negro movement. He

spoke of things that the party has done, but in

which the Party has not made any organizational

gains. PATTERSON stated that the CP has been

able to get a lot of things moving, but through

all this, the Party has not made any orcanizational

gains.

BENJAMIN DAVIS also spoke and

stated that

although the CP influence is felt, "we" do not make

gains.

"We are reduced to the characterization of

Communist professors.

pointed out that,

were before

"Ilne the CP must examine this to find out what

is wrong."

JAMES

JACKSON spoke and stated that he

thought he had

a couple of proposals that he felt

were possible,

even though the time was getting

late. He stated that he thought that perhaps

LESTER DAVIS, identiried as a CP member from

Chicago, could get some resolutions for submission

to the NAACP Convention and if that fails, then

maybe others could do it in other areas.

this fails, then perhaps the resolutions could

be introduced at the convention itself. He then

resolution be introduced and that

the forces work for a massive legislative lobby

that would mobilize the NAACP's full resources and

seek to secure cooperative efforts from other

organizations on the basis that this is the 39th

year since the Emancipation Proclamation and the

CP wants to pressure Congress and the President

to call for an Emancipation Proclamation.

JACKSON proposed that the CP work for a

three-day holiday or work stoppage in commemoration

of 100 years of deferred rights.

The informant reported that in the discussion

which followed these proposals, it was felt that

those present did not think too much of the

possibility of getting a work stoppage of work

however, it was felt that something could

no stain even in the emancipation Proclamation.

It was felt that this could be done by worling

through the youth to get them to forn

a massive youth

march.

had received information that on July 2, 1902, the

CP held Its first meeting in connection with the

NAACP Convention at the Royal Hotel in Atlanta,

Georgia.

LESTER DAVIS, a CP member from Chicago, stated

At this meeting it was decided to

support the hotel picketing in Atlanta.

the only topics discussed at these meetings were

the possibillty of introducing

peace resolution

and possibly changing the resolution passed annually

banning Communism.

The Party desired to change

the anti-Communism resolution, but did not think

a direct attack on the resolution would have any

chance

of success.

The informant stated that it was learned

on July 7, 1962, that the resolution for changing the

name of the NAACP had failed because the resolution

received no support on the floor of the convention.

NY I-o advised that a final meeting of this

CP group was held on July 8, 1962, and the tenor

of the meeting was discouragement, because only five

persons had participated on behalf of the Party.

LESTER DAVIS was particularly upset and stated that

the Party should either make a good showing or not

try to do anything at all.

NY T-6 advised that it was his opinion that

the CP accomplished little or nothing at the convention

and it did not influence the outcome of the convention

In any significant way.

members who were to be delegates or alternate

delegates to the convention were to be instructed

by their CP Districts to maice contact with LESTER

The Informant advisea En

that he received

information that a meeting of the CP caucus present

at the Royal Hotel, Atlanta,

that she could and would attend the youth meetings

of the NAACP Convention and would make every effort to

establish contacts and relations, which might make it

possible to influence the course of the convention.

NY I-T on March 23, 1962, advised

that ALVA BUXENBAUM was a member

of the Brooklyn youth club, lew

York District CP.

At this meeting an effort was made to

assess

the strength of the CP within the convention.

It was learned that a number of the key party members

that had been expected to attend the convention either

were not in attendance, had not been located or were

not able to attend.

*west region, but was defeated.

This was considered

by the CP caucus as a serious setback because it

destroyed the only possible effective vehicle within

which the CP could work to influence the policies of

the convention.

The informant reported that the CP

program at the convention was as follows:

I. To work for a resolution calling for

a youth march.

2. To work for a resolution calling for

a national observance of the Emancipation Proclamation

to take place sometime between November 1, 1962

and January 1, 1903.

3. To work for a resolution to call for a

Presidential Emancipation Prociamation to end all

Jim Crowism in America.

The informant learned that TED BASSETT

had stated that this was the most poorly organized

NAACP Convention from the Paroy's point of view, but

that the Party delegates would have to do the very

best they could.

He stated that the thing to do

was for each person present to determine what

people were functioning cn a national level on the

Resolutions Committee and with which ones it was

possible to establish friendly relations. This

would have to be done in a short order if such

relations were to be established prior to resolutions

being introduced at this convention.

Those present agreed to canvass the

convention to make every effort to locate Party

delegates and other

They agreed to meet daily

to discuss progress and to meet for a final

session, at which time a general assessment of

the convention woulá be mace.

This would be

valuable to the National Office of the Party

in assessing the work of the NAACP.

The informant learned that at another

meeting of the CP caucus the Party members

convention delegates and they noted that the Party

was weak and lacked organization at the convention.

It was pointed out that BERNICE GABRIEL, a CP

as well as an unknown CP female delegate from New

York.

CP FUNCTIONARIES MEETING

NY I-8 advised in July, 1962, that a meeting

BASSETT related that at the convention

the NAACP went on record again of calling for the

abolition of the House Un-American Activities

The struggle on the

political front is relateá directly to the economic

question and the unfolding suffrage arive.

WILLIAM I. PATTERSON commented that the

NAACPS calling for the abolition of the HUAC is

a tremendous advance and "we" should support this

action.

He suggested sending a carefully worded

letter to the NAACP supporting them on this matter.

GUS MALL remarked that the convention was

truly historical and "we" should have a person on

a national level that can mix with the NAACP.

"The 1960 elections are being waged in

As a consequence, the Democratic and Republican Parties

The Negro peculais movement, no longer saricried by

The concept

"Freedoin Now! gains momentur, with each passing day.

unlike the situation which prevailed as the time the

NAACP raised the slogan 'Free by 63' and

relied

upon court actions to achieve it, today's movement is developing

a strategy and tactics which project it forward as the

most dynanto and compelling force on the American

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT

different report on the latest developments of the

of things had taken place, including the NAACP Convention,

which ne and a number of other comrades had attended.

LIGHTFOOT stated that he therefore felt it ezpedient

to give a full report on the NAACP Convention and touch

briefly on other aspects of the negro people's struggles.

LIGHTFOOT stated that it was his feeling that

che sist Nauional Convention of the NAACe, which took place

In St. Paul, Minnesota,

was a very significant convention.

He added that his overall estimate of the convention

was that it was a very positive convention.

There were

a few negative points, but these were outweighed by the

positive aspects of the convention.

LIGHTFOOT said that the convention was held

against a background of the growing collapse of world

Imperialism.

The dominant forces among the Negro people

today are those who associate themselves with

militant mass action.

The NAACP finds itself in a position

where it has to change its tactics in order to

maintain Its status.

In summing up the positive aspects of the

convention, LIG mFOOT listed the following points:

I..

He felt there was, within the convention,

the recognition of mass action

as a principal method

of struggle.

Ny Tw4 in July, 1960, advised that a meeting

of the CP, USA Secretariat and invited guests, was hero

at Cr Headquarters, 23 west 20th Street, New York city,

on July 13, 1960.

At this meeting CIAUDE LIGITFOOT gave a report

on the NAACP Convention.

LIGHTFOOT noted that the

convention took place against a background of the

emergence of independence for 16 Negro led African states.

He said that this was having a profound effect on

millions of Anerican Negroes and was becoming an

Important point In American foreign policy. He contrasted

this against the present internal situation of the United

Stater wherein he said that the struggle for Negro rights

Is not progressing.

In speaking of the convention,

LIGHIFOOT commented that the convention was divided into

panels dealing with leadership, political action and the

use of economic weapons and others.

LIGHTFCOI commented that no substantial headway

was made in terms of integrating young people on a policy

level. The young people had influenced the convention

than any other class of people. LIGHTFOOT commented

that in his opinion, the primary thing was that the

leadership of the NAACP, in the past decade, has had no

conception of what is required to win freedom in the

United States.

He said that the convention was

froe. of

"red baiting"

in the principal speeches, and panels.

NY T-4 advised that following LICHTFOOT's report,

a discussion period was held. WILLIAM WEINSTONE*stated

that it was necessary to take up the struggle against

'Communism in the NAACP." BEN DAVIS felt that

the Party

must support any and all organizations that further

the Negro Peoples Movement and he said that the NAACP is an

essential organization to express the aim of the Negro

people. DAVIS regarded the NAAjP as an important

organization in the Negro People's Movement.

Continuings DAVIS remarked that the actions

of the organizations

•In the Negro PeOpLe's Movement

will determine how the Negro will act and how the Negro

will vote.

DAVIS stated that it was/ the Party's advantage

to build the Negro People's Movement in the south and

the Negro American Lajor Council (NALC) in order that

the NAACP will not continue to dominate the thinking

of the Negro.

He said that the Party must point out that

"red baiting" is the one remaining way in wnich the ruling

class of this country maintains its ties with the Negro

People's Movement.

The informant advised that CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT

agreed with the comments made by BEN DAVIS and said that

a cadre among these organizations. LIGHTFCOP added that

the Party must move to increase its cadre within the

NAACP.

at St. Paul, Minnesota,

on Tuesday, June 21, 1960, witt

headquarters at the Municipal Auditorium, St. Paul

, and much

of the activity centering around the St. Paul Hotel.

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, Chairman, CP of Illinois, appeared

In st. Paul early in the morning of June 21, 1900, to

contact his associates. LIGHTFOOT was in St. Paul to

coordinate and direct CP strategy in an attempt to influence

the NAACP Convention. LIGHTFCOT indicated that his

• "key men"

at the convention, through whom he would try to work, were

OLIVER MARTIN Ya CP member from New York City,, Who was a

delegate to the National Convention, and ROBERT HYMER, a CP Mil

member from Chicago, who was an alternate delegate to

the

convention. HYMER

eventually became a delegate

on June 22, 1950.

It had originally been

suggested that PETTIS PERRY,

a CP official who is familiar with NAACP affairs, was to

have come from the west coast to attend the st.

Paul convention,

but LIGHTFOOT stated PERRY was unable to do so because of the

expenses involved, and accordingly, LIGHTFOOT was taking

his place.

LIGHTFOOT's early instructions to CP members active

at the convention were to push housing for Negroes by re-

commending the establishment of a National Housing Committee

and a definite legislative program assuring open occupancy

on a national level.

The CP also urged active interest

were items on the agenda set up by the National Office of

the NAACP.

In connection with individuals in attendance at the

NAACP Convention, OLIVER MARTIN; CP member from the Bronx, was

observed on June 20, 1950, in connection with pre-convention

actIvities. MARTIN occupied room 316 at the St. Paul Hotel

and was attending the convention as an official delegate from

the Bronx, New York group of NAACP.

BARBARA TILLER: from Chicago, who has been connected

with the Progressive Movement in the past

and is scheduled

to be asked to join the CP, was observed at pre-convention

activities on June 20, 1960, and was attending the convention

as an alternate delegate from the Morgan Park Youth Council

Section.

TILLER is active in youth work in Chicago and is

vice-president of the Morgan Park Youth Council. TILLER

was staying at Room 664 of the Ryan Hotel.

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT was supposed to have arrivein

St. Paul on Monday, June 20, 1960, but was not observed until

Tuesday morning.

On the morning of June 21, 1960, LIGHTFOOT

tried to register as an official observer at the convention,

but when the official listings of observers were subsequently

released later during the morning, it was noticed that his

name had been scratched out on these listing's and that he had

not been accepted by the registration committee in this

capacity.

The opening session of the convention started at

officials, including ROT WILKINS, NAACP Executive Secretary,

and tried

to develop friendiy contacts with some of these

individuals, but the very mention of his name caused

considerable consternation among NAACP leaders and

convention delegates. When the Chicago delegation to

the convention noticed LIGHTFOOT's name scratched out on

been announced by a note

circulated by TED

LIGHTFOOD instructed those present in what was to

be done in connection with the convention:

OLIVER MARTIN, who had been invited to this

meeting but had not attended, was to push resolutions

concerning jobs (Fair Employment Practices).

2. JANNEY was to circulate a folder and cover

letter to convention delegates.

This pamphlet, captioned

"Freedom Now! A Plan to Increase the Political

Power of

Negro Citizens," dated June, 1960, and issued by

LEVEL EL FINTLES, MaN recutive Director, Chicago league

Conference of Negro Voters,

ana BENNETT J. JOHNSON,

of Negro Voters, Post Office Box 6133,

Chicago 80, Illinois. The cover letter to be circulated

with the pamphlet was on the letterhead of the bicag

League of Negro Voters and introduced HERMAN GILBERT and

ALBERT JANNEY as official delegates of the Chicago

League of Negro Voters to the NAACP Convention. The

letter was signed by BENTLEY and JOHNSON.

3. The CP wanted to introduce and obtain

support for a resolution on Civil Rights, which resolution

had been written by AüBERI JANNEY, apparently at the

suggestIOn o LIGHTFOOT.

This resolution declared that

the Sist Annual Convention of the NAACP should state

emphatically that no candidate nor platform would be

accepted which did not call for the following:

"(.) A Presidential Executive Order creating

a Federal Fair Employment Practices Act with

full powers to investigate and remedy discriminatory

employment practices in both public and private

concerns.

The group discussed the difficulty in intro-

ducing this resolution to the convention and considered

the possibility of approaching DE. WARREN SPENCER,

Evanston, Illinois, NAACP delegate serving on the

• Resolutions

Committee, in this

connection.

There was no indication

during this discussion that SPENCER was in any way

sympathetic to the CP or to any of the individuals involved,

but only that he might be used as an innocent instrument

for this

It was decided to consider this further.

lost and was unable to get there.

On the late afternoon of June 22, 1900, alter

the convention workshop sessions had termiiated,

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT advised a few of his friends that he

was concerned and discouraged over the lack of progress

made by the Party in trying to influence convention

activities.

He indicated that to date these activities

had generally failed; that ROBERT HYMER had failed to

be elected

to the National Youth work Committee and had

been unable to have any influence in that area;

that Party-instigated attempts to introduce a resolution

urging housing matters had failed and it was

being abandoned.

LIGHTFOOT said that ALBERT JANNEY had not been

very active circulating the pamphlet on the Negro's

Political Power which he was supposed to be circulating

in connection with the Chicago League of Negro Voters:

and that to date no delegate had been located to introduce

to the convention the civil Rights resolution written

by JaNnEY.

LIGHTFOOT stated that he planned to attend a

convention workshop on Wednesday:

dealing with the

Negroes' use of economic power and urged other CF

During the late afternoon session at the NAACP

TED BASSETT, who is a reporter for

convention and

advised them in writing of a meeting to be held at 11:00

p.m., that night in Room 221 at the Ryan Hotel, St. Paul,

That night, shortly past 11:00 p.m., it was

noted that the following individuals were among those

present in Room 221:

HERMAN C. GILBERT and ALBERT

JANNEY, who are active in the

Chicago Negro Voters League

and

' are CP members;

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, and ROBERT

HYMER, a CP member from Chicago

who was an alternate delegate to

the NAACP Convention

During this meeting LIGHTFOOT laid down the CP

tactiss for upcoming

sessions of the National Convention,

and called for support for a resolution calling for support

of measures to bring about equal rights for negroes.

LIGHTFOOT indicated that although one CP member at the

convention was originally to have pushed a resolution

on housing, these instructions were being revised and a

resclution on youth activities was to be pushed.

It was also learned that OLIVER MARTIN, a

delegate to the convention from New York City,

was in the

CP faction and was to push two resolutions at

the National

Convention; one on jobs

and one on South Africa.

In the late evening of June 22, 1960, OLIVER MARTIN

called a meeting in his room, room 316 at the

2. A Civil Rights resolution which had

been written by ALBERT JANNEY, which HYMER

will try to have introduced to the convention.

3.

A labor resolution which they would

try to have introduced by someone not necessarily

a CP member.

It was hoped that FIIZGERALD

would take

action on this resolution.

MARTIN called another meeting for this group for

11:00 D.M., Friday, June 24, 1960, in his hotel room.

At the close of business sessions at the convention

on Thursday, June 23, 1960, which sessions were devoted pri-

marily to the meeting of Regional Workshops, ALBERT JANNEY

stated that attempts to introduce his Civil

Rights

resolution had railed to date; that HYMER had given it to

a minister in the chicago delegation who was not a CP

member, and that no action had been taken on the resolution

so far.

As ut that time it was felt that CP members

active

at the convention, had not been in any way active

in pushing their causes, and that during the

workshop sessions on Thursday, no CP members were known

to have been vocal or active in any way.

Saturday, June 25, 1960, was devoted to the

Convention Plenary Session on Legislative Matters, and

during this sssion the CP, through Its few controlled

delegates, was not active

to any degree from the

neld a brief conference at the Convention Hall: BASSETI

It was also learned on saturday that the meeting

scheduled for 11:00 p.m.,

Friday night in OLIVEr

MARTIN's room, #316 at the st. Paul Hotel, had

not been well attended. This meeting which nad included

non-Party people, had been directed toward obtaining:

support by these

people for CP resolutions, but it was

apparent from the lack of activity on saturday during

the general session, that this meeting had

accomplished. nothing.

On the morning of June 24, 1960, ALBERT JANNEY,

Room zed Ryan Hotel, conferred with HERMAN GILBERT and

others concerning the failure to date to obtain any

concrete results in the oresentation of resolutions

urged by the cr.

JANNEY indicated that his Civil Rights

resolution had apparently failed in the Resolutions

Committee, however, when the NAACP resolution on Civil

Rights would be presented to the convention, they would

have a last ditch try at making amendments from the

floor in connection with this resolution. JANNEY

indicated that the labor resolution was

announced that there was to be a meeting in JANNEY's room,

at 10:00 p.m., Saturday

night, to evaluate the C's work at this

convention.

It is to be noted that at no time during the convention

was there any proposal on the

part oI LIGHIFOOT or the

others, to try and block the

"red baiting" resolutior

on Communism always passed at these NAACP conventions.

At the direction of CLAUDE LIGHTFCOI, a meeting

was held at 10:00 p.m., on Saturday, June 25, 1960,

• in a hotel room on the second floor of the Ryan Hotel.

The announced purpose of this meeting was to evaluate

the ce's work at the NAACP Convention. This meeting

was poorly attended, with only a few

CP members present,

including LIGHIFOOT.

As the meeting got under way,

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT called for some observations by those

in attendance, as to the positive and negative results

of CP attempts to influence convention activities.

OLIVER MARTIN stated that he thought this year's

convention had been better than in the past, and

. that in

spite of the passage of the "red baiting" resolution, the

Party had succeeded in insesting a shorter work week

amendment in the laborresolution.

MARTIN indicated that the

group he had met with Friday night had generally deserted the

cause on the floor during the saturday session, and that

apparently they were not the right people. He indicated

the Party should place more people in NAACP activities

because only voting delegates were of any value at a

convention such as this, and only two or so delegates at this

convention were CP controlled and even they were

restricted by conservative elements.

It was generally agreed that more work should

be done by the Party in the branch level presenting

proposals for resolutions far in advance of the

convention date, gaining support for their causes, and assurin

their election as delegates to the convention.

Someone

indicated that it was hoped the party could get many more

delegates to the NAACP convention next year in Philadelphia.

There

was some discussion on the fact that the

re-organization of the NAACP in many communities, from

smaller units into larger big city branches, had

handicapped the CP and generally diminished

the effect

of any Communist infiltration.

ROBERT HYMER stated

that although the Party had had no particular influence in the

NAACP youth work at the convention, the NAACP LEsell had

developed an ambitious and militant program which was

generally in keeping with the CP's objectives.

TED BASSETT indicated he would write an editorial

for "The Worker" in connection with the convention and

stated he would confer further with OLIVER MARTIN in this

connection on their return to New York.

aIssatisIled with the

CP's accomplishments at the

convention, but that it was gratifying to see that the

NAACP Youth Movement was developing rapidly and that the

NAACE had taken initiative in

aligning itself and

working harmontously with other mass organizations,

labor,

ete., which was in accord with the Party's program. He

generally agreed that the Party had not been too

influential at the convention in view of its weak

representation among the convention delegates and because

of the fact that the NAACP had developed a full and

ambitious program on Its own.

As a result of this discussion CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT

proposed that the Party should establish a National Committee

on NAACP affairs.

From LIGHtFOOT's comnents it appeared that

PETTIS PERRY who has previously handled the NAACP work fOr

the Party, has had this assignment taken away from •

him and has been replaced by LIGHTFOOT.

This informant continued that the resolution calling

issues was defeated by a vote of 11 to 10.

This informant learned that TED BASSETT was furious

when he learned of this,

particularly since the CP representative

on the Resolutions committee had voted to reject the resolution.

It was informant's understanding that the CP role is to try

to weaken contröl of the National Office of the NAACP over

ot the Nationg,

various branches in order to create disunity and factionalism.

This informant further learned that the Freedom Riders

resolution had been

"watered down" in the Resolutions Committee

(It is noted that information previously appears

in this report describing the resolution adopted

concerning the Freedom Riders

as innocuous.)

This ininment continued that when resolutions on

civil rights were introduced, an amendment was proposed from

tne Iloor which was almost identica. with the resolution

calling for a second Emancipation Proclamation by the

President. There was only a slight change in the wording as

compared to the resolution originally sponsored by the cP.

This indicated to the informant that the unidentified person

who introduced the amendment from the floor was possibly a

CP member. The representatives from the National Office who

were on the stand had no objection to this amendment. It

was read and handed to the secretary and will be included

as an amendment to the eivil rights resolution.

be realized.

It was also emphasized that resolutions to be

Introduced at the 1962 convention should be initiated through

This informant advised that the fast that the

the NAACP is away from a violent anti-communist attitude.

"We shall have to report that we personally

do have communistic leanings"

Further in the same article, "we do have

communist leanings when it comes to

, the

Communist theory of the International State

and the question of racial equality"

In the latter paragraph of the same editorial,

"Communism believes in racial equality and

SO

does this writer."

On August 30, 1951, Mrs. W.C. PRICE, 519

North Lilasay, Oklahoma City: Oklahoma,

advised that she

had been employed by "The Black Dispatch" for approximately

30 years.

She volunteered information that this newspaper is

principally

owned and managed by ROSCOr DUNJEE.

She

stated that DUNJEE is active in the NAACP but that "The Black

Dispatch" is not an official organ of the NAACP.

Mrs. PRICE

advised that many people consider DUNJEE to be a Communist

Inasmuch as

he is known to have associated with ALAN SHAW,

State Secretary of the Communist Party in Oklaboma,

and

other members of the CP.

Mrs. PRICE stated through her

close association with DUNJEE, she is convinced he is not a

member of the CP.

She explained his association with members of

the CP by stating that DUNJEE, as a typical newspaperman,

associated with people like ALAN SHAW in order to keep abreast

of the Russian activities and to know at all times what lines

the CP follows.

MoS. PRICE related that DUNJLE had not

associated with the communists since Russia ceased to be

considered our ally.

She further advised she had not seen

ALAN SHAW at the office of

"The Black Dispatch" inasmuch

as she understood he left Oklahoma City in the Fall of 1950.

They are entitled to their opinions, and I will fight for their

rights to them; but the rest of us are entitled to state our

conviction that the herd-mindedness of Communist and near

Communist blocs has worked to corrupt the processes of democracy

in the unions, and that the irresponsibility of the Party--both

Conmittee on National Recovery, of which he, DAVIS, was

the director. Mr. DAVIS advised

that Dr. BUNCIE was active

at the organizational conterence of the National Negro

Congress and was considered one of its founders.

JOHN P.

DAVIS stated that at the time of its origin, the National

Negro Congress was a completely respectable organization

and that in his opinion the communists were not a dominant

influence until the 1940's.

He said that it was possible

that the Communists in the National Negro Congress did

try to get control of it from the beginning but were not

successful. He said that he considered himself to be the

founder of the National Negro Congress and the leading

organizer of the 1935 congress.

DAVIS said that in many

respects he was pro-communist at the time of the 935

congress, but indicated. he had not been a member of the

cr and consequently had no information concerning any

meeting of the CP fraction at the 1935 conference.

He said

that he knew of no association on the part of Dr. BUNCHE with

any of the & leaders at this conference or at any other

time or on any occasion on which De. BuNclE might have

spoken or met with CP leaders.

DAVIS said that he has

always considered Dr. BUNCHE to be anti-Communist, citing

as an example a conversation he had with Dr. BUNCHE in

the mid 1930's. in which Ds. BUNCHE, who had just returned

from China, expressed

feas that China was in serious danger

because of

the increasing strength of the Chinese Communists.

During the course of another investigation conducted

by the Federal Fureau of Investigation, Dr. BUNCHE stated

that he believe the idea of the National Negro Congress

was fundamentally a good idea, and that so long as PHILLIP

RANDOLPH waS President, the attempts of the Communists to

dominate the organization were generally unsuccessiul. He

said that in 1940 at the Third National Convention of the

National Negro Congress at Washington, D.C., RANDOLPH made

a speech critical of the Soviet Union after which Communists

took control of the organization and elected MAX YERGAN

president to replace RANDOLPH who resigned. Dr. BUNCHE

said that he had very little to do with the National Negro

Congress after 1935 and

the First Annual Convention in

Chicago in 1936.

He said

that since he was in accord with

Mr. RANDOLPH's position in opposing the Communists at the

National Negro Congress, he resigned shortly after the

1940 convention.

Dr. BUNCHE listed on his

Loyalty Form under the

provisions of Executive Order 10422 "Institute of Pacific Relations.

and when they returned to the United States they worked

closely with the CP forces in the auto industry.

NY I-50 advised that this close feeling of cooperation

continued between WALIER REUTHER and the CP group in the

auto industry until 1940 when WALTER REUTHER broke with the

left wing group and started up a group of his own, which

was anti-Communist.

VICTOR REUTHER, as opportunists who saw the general sentiment

on hospital staffs and against patients; to re-establish

the freedom of the medical press, the Forum urges medical

society publications to open their volumes to diverse

Views on controversial subjects; and to provide a forum

wherein socially liberal doctors may express their views

In opposition to the policies of organized medicine.

merged with the syL to form

the YSL.

He explained that

the YPSL did

not merge with anyone,

that it continued to

exist as the youth section of the socialist Party.

explained that a small

group of the YeoL was aroppea

expelled, or suspended from that organization and joinec

the SYL,

which he characterized as the youth group of the

"Trotskyite ISL."

He explained that after these few former

members of the YPsl joined the syl, the SyL then proceeded

to change its name for its own purposes.

On April 9, 195€, another confidential informant

The YSL has frequently worked in close sympathetic

cooperation with the

each major issue given mutual consideration is decided upon

by these organizations individually.

The YSL serves as

apprenticeship for the ISL, but ISL selection of members from

r5L ranks is made on an individual and personal basis.

MOLLIE ILSON, the outgoing ELf president,

*i gave the keynote address at the convention and

stated the following:

"As we enter into our deliverations at this

convention we are aware of the threatening coalition

of evil forces, an alliance of war-crazy, fanatical

racists and white supremacists. All anti-labor,

anti-democratic outfits,

the Birchites, Minute-Men

and the Ku Klux Klan have now coalesced into a new

and serious challenge to all the economic and cul-

tural gains ot the American people.

"These evil forces intensified their bia

for political power. after the assassination of pre-

sident: Kennedy.....

uts.

"Suffice it to say that the Ultra-right

soon after, feeling very confident, began to show

their teeth.

"The present-day ultra-reactionaries have

taken over the Republican Party, the party of Abranam

• Lincoln, and placed as its standard-bearer and nominee

for President, Senator Barry Goldwater, its most

reactionary spokesman.

"The Ultra-right's cariuring of the Republican

Party, one of the two major parties,

1s a sinister

development that goes way beyond that of McCarthyism.

Governor Rockefeller's vigorous speech of objection

at the convention has yet to be followed by him,

by

any other leading Republican, with a denunciation

of Goldwater as their standard bearer.

'We therefore propose a policy for this Pre-

sidential Election that should help not only to de-

feat Goldwater for President, but smash the power.of

the Ultr right and to do so on the basis of a program

of actios for Peace, enforcement of the Civil Rights

Bill, expansion of the Anti-Poverty Bill, passage of

a Medicare Bill through social Security and Senate

ratification of the U. N. Genocide Convention; repeal

of all thought control measures and bills like. the

Smith and MeCarran Acts and for an amendment of our im:

migration laws to remove all discriminatory -

second-class citizenship - clauses against foreign-

born Americans.

GORDON concluded by stating that they

should celebrate the 45th anniversary of the adoption

of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right

to vote "as full fledged citizens, by helping to win

full fledged citizenship for the

Negro people in

every sphere of life and together with them and

all the other Americans who are considered minority

Americans.

Together we roll up a majority.

We

the women and minorities' have the most compelling

reasons for burying the Ultra-right under an over-

whelming defeat for Barry Goldwater:

be neutral. Women, the bearers of life, can't be

neutral.

New York City, to protest the rise of Nazism and

anti-

Semitism. It is now a continuing organization springing

into action when the need arises.

JEWISH CULTURAL CLUBS AND SOCIETIES

Also known as Jewish Program

Service Committee

A source advised on April 27, 1954, that the

former leaders, Including GEDALIA SANDLER, Executive

secretary, of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO),

Jewish nationality section of the International Workers

order (IWO), had established a committee at 1133 Broadway,

New York, New York. Through this committee they were organizing

cultural clubs and societies based on JPFO lodges which haä

beei dissolved on December 15, 1953, in the course of proceed-

ings by the New York State authorities culminating in the

liquidation of the IWO.

A second source advised on March 15, 1961, that a

meeting of the National Groups Commission of the Conmunist

Party, United States of Anerica, was held on March 2, 1961,

in New Yorks City.

GEDALIA SANDIER WAS

among those present

and spoke of his

experiences in maintaining the Jewish

lodges after the dissolution of the IWO, which,

to avoid

• prosecution, have no national name or organization.

SANDIER stated that these lodges "lived" as clubs

• . and

societies by maintaining their cultural, fraternal and

civic activities, but which activities are less polítical

than in the former lodges.

New York gave leadership to the

rest of the country since

the New York lodges were the

strongest and had the more politically developed comrades.

These clubs and societies still maintain a medical

plan, funeral benefits and mutual aid funds.

There are 132

clubs and societies nationally, 63 of which are located in

New York City.

A third source furnished information in May, 1963,

that the clubs and societles are located at 1133 Broadway,

Room 1429, New York, New York, under the name of the Jewish

Program Service Committee, but are more widely known as the

A source advised on January

meeting was sponsored by

"The worker,

an east

Communist newspaper, on January 24, 1900, at the fark

source

as the chairman of the New York County Communist

Party (CP), invited the audience to attend a protest

meeting to be held in Union Square, New York City, on

January 26, 1900, to protesi anti-Semitism in west Germany.

A second source on January 26, 1960, advised

that the CP had prepared 6,000 leaflets in connection with

anti-Semitism to be distributed

at a rally to be held that

day at Union Square, New York City.

These learlets,

according to the source, were not distributed since

CP was not openly represented at the meeting.

However,

according to the source, mown Conmunists participated

openly in the meeting.

On September 13, 1951, a Special Agent of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation

• by means of a suitable

pretext, spoke to SAM PEVZNER, who stated that

he is the

public relations officer of the Committee Against Nazism

and Anti-Semitism.

He stated that the organization

initially known as the conmittee To stop The Revival of

Nazism and Anti-Semitism, originated as an

"aci noc"

committee to sporsor a sally on January 25

1950, in

New York City, to protest the rise of Nazism and anti-

Semitism.. It

is now a continuing organization springing

into action when the nced arises.

On April 25: 1963, a third source stated that

captioned organisation is located in Foom 722, 1153

Broadway, New

York City.

This third source on May 3, 1961, advised

that SAN PEVZNER was a member of the CP, USA, at that

time.

NATIONAL COMMITTEE AGAINST NAZI CRIMINALS

AND NAZISM IN AMERICA, Formerly known as

National Committee Against Nazi War Criminals

and Nazism in America, and Committee Against

Nazi Criminals and Nazism in America

A source advised on February 11, 1963, that at a

meeting in Chicago on February 10, 1903, a group of Iormer

members of the Chicago Anti-Adolph Heusinger Committee (CAAHC.

recently disbanded, together with representatives of several

other nationality groups met and formed a Committee Against

Nazi Criminals and Nazism in America, subsequently renamed the

National Committee Against Nazi Criminals and Nazism in

American.

This organiztion's headquarters is in a private

residence,

It is a-non-membership organization and reportedly

represents some 15,000persons from various nationality groups.

Its aims and purposes are to seek out men who committed

war crimes in Europe, apprehend them, and force their return to

the countries in which their crimes were committed. The President

of this Committee is Rabbi s. BURR YAMPOL who is anti-communist,

but would accept aid from communists if It would serve his

purpose. JACK KLING has played a leading role in the formation

of this committee and is preparing the "fact sheet" setting out

the purposes of this committee.

A second source advised between January, 1963, and

April 23, 1963, that four of the five Vice Chairmen of

committee are Communist Party (CP) members and that in April,

1963, JACK KLING, a leading CP of Illinois District functionary,

instructed these Vice Chairmen that he did not want the committee

identified as communist, and therefore

they should arrange for

replacements to further remove the possibility of identilyng

JEWISH CULTURAL CLUBS AND SOCIETIES

Also known as Jewish Program

Service Committee

A source advised on April 27, 1954, that the

former leaders, including GEDALIA SANDLER, Executive

Secretary, of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO),

Jewish nationality section of the International Workers

Order (IWO) nad established a committee at 1133 Broadway,

New York, New York. Through this committee they were organizing

cultural clubs and societies

, based

on JPrO lodges.

which had

been dissolved on December 15, 1953, in the course of proceed-

ings by the New York State authorities culminating in the

liquidation of the Ilo.

A second source advised on March 15, 1961, that a

meeting of the National Groups Commission of

Party,

the Communist

United States of America, was held on march 2, 1961,

in New York City.

GEDALIA SANDIER was among those present

and spoke of his

experiences in maintaining the Jewish

lodges after the dissolution of the Iwo, which,

to avoid

prosecution, have no national name or organization.

SANDLER stated that these lodges "lived" as clubs

and

societies by maintaining their cultural, fraternal and

civic activities, but which activities are

less political

than in the former lodges. New York gave leadership to the

rest of the country since the New York lodges were the

- strongest and had the more politically developed comrades.

These clubs and societies still maintain a medical

plan, funeral benefats and mutual aia funas.

There are 132

clubs and societies nationally, 63 of which

are located in

New York City.

A third source furnished infonation in May, 1963,

that the clubs and

societies are located at 1133 Broadway,

Room 1429, New York,

New york, under the name of the Jewish

Program Service Committee, but are more widely known as the

Jewish Cultural Clubs and

Societies.

RUTH

GASSMAN gave a report of the Eastern Seaboard Conference

the following:

1. Calendar, Jewish Book Month and 75th Anniversary

of Death of EMMA LAZARUS The letter opened with a statement

that "we

look forward to a most productive and gratifying

season of activities on the crucial problems confronting our

Book Month, November 16 - December 16, be dedicated to a

discussion of the reprint of two EMMA

• LAZARUS articles,

"The

Jewish Problem" and "The Last Revolt of the Jews"

, in

relation to "the rising tide of anti-Semitism stimulated by

the growth of/ultra-Right movement."

2. Membership and Club Building

In regard to

membership and club building; the letter stated that the

Midterm Board meeting had reviewed and evaluated the results

of the membership drive launched at the Fourth National

Convention in November, 1961, at which a goal was set for a

25 per cent increase in membership by June, 1962, and

50 per cent by the next convention.

It stated that per capita

payments received by the time of the meeting indicated that

there was a ten per cent increase in membershiy and several

new clubs formed.

## Page 494

NY I00-104142

It was felt that good progress was made since 1t

was the first year in which such goals were undertaken in

an organized manner, with concentration in three areas -

Los Angeles, Detroit and Brooklyn.

The letter stated that as an experiment to reduce

the loss of new members in New York, new members were

Induced to pay a year's dues and receive a gift copy of

"Emma Lazarus, Woman With a Torch."

In paying two years'

dues, the new member rèceived a copy of the ERNESTINE.

ROSE book. In addition, club members enrolling three new

members received a copy of the ERNESTINE ROSE book.

The

experiment proved to be successful when more than 100 new

members paid up one or two years' dues and have stayed with

their club.

3. ERNESTINE ROSE Headstone

The Convention approved project of selecting a

delegation to send to London, England,

for the unveiling

of a headstone over the grave of ERNESTINE ROSE has been

amended.

Ios Angeles, Chicago and Brooklyn, each district will now

have the opportunity of selecting one member as part of the

delegation if the district attains a 80al of a 50 per cent

increase over and above the membership recorded at the end

of 1961 or at the time of the November, 1961 Convention.

4. Convention Fund

The payment of $1.00 per member was due for 1962,

towards a total of $2.00 per club member before the next

convention.

according to JUNE GORDON,

the ELF has followed a policy. of

cooperating with all peace organizations which initiate

actions, but has avoided direct involvement or affiliation

with one organization or another, in order not to become

involved in differences that arise between the various

organizations and committees in the peace movement.

GORDON stated that one of the deciding factors

In affiliating with

such an organization would be to decide

the extent the Emma Lazarus Clubs could help to involve the

Jewish community in the peace movement.

The main question

Is will affiliation help to get other Jewish organizations

become affiliated.

convention of the AFPJ held in New York City on March 26,27, 1949, •

the "right-wing elements" were eliminated and the "left-wing

Communist element" was elected.

On Decemwer 20, 1949,

the above source reported he

had been informed by a member

of the Communist Party, USA,

that the above federation was under the full control of the

"left-wing and progressive elements"

The same source stated on April 29, 1960, that the

AFPJ continues to function from its

headquarters at 1133 Broadway,

Room 732, New York, New York, and is still controlled Dy

communists and "left-wingers"

An amendment to the charter of the Southern

Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW), which has been cited

by the Congressional Committee on Un-American Activities

as a communist iront, changed the name of the organization

to the Southem Conference Educational Fund, Inc., and

listed its purposes as being to improve the educational

and cultural standards of the southern people in accordance

traditions.

and ideals.

A confidential infornant advised on June 29,

1956, that during the time the Southern Conference for

Human Welfare was in existence, Communist Party members

were members of and worked actively in the Schw.

However,

since the formation of the SCEF

Inc., rank and

communisi

Party members have not been encouraged to work in

the stu, infurnaut stated that the SCEl is a progressive

liberal organization which he considers a Communist Party

front organization because it has gone along with the

Communist Party on certain issues, particularly on the

racial question, and througi: the years certain Communist

Party members in the New Orleans area have been assigned

to work in the organization to further Communist Party

principles.

AAA REALTY TENANTS

ARE

SLOWLY BEING CRUSHED

This Is to notify the entire Greensboro Community that the tenants of AAA Realty

Company are being treated In the cruelest sort of way. Little children are being

padlocked out of their houses in cold weather. The hcres of invalids are being

padlocked.

Men and women are being forced to move out into the street.

Te-

nants must live in fear of evictions even though they have paid their rent Into

the escrow account set up by the court.

Why 1s all of this happening? Because Kaye Agapion of AAA Realty is refusing

to follow the court ordered injunction.

Because Kaye Agapion claims that we

tenants have not paid our rent.

Because Kaye Agapion is arbitrarily demanding

payments for unexplained fees. Because the court and the sheriff's offi-, are

supporting Kaye Agapion in her cruel and unjust actions.

Because the nois

media is supporting Kaye Agapion and AAA Realty by printing misleading and

false articles about the strike being near settlement. We had to write our

own leaflet because we could not trust the news media to print the truth.

We, the tenants of AAA Realty, have tried to work with the court, but we have

only received greater persecution and harrassment from AAA Realty as a result.

Today alone, at least ten families have been padlocked out. Little children

are outside without food and clothing.

There are ten families with no where

to sleep in Greensboro tonight, but these people have paid their rent according

to court order. They have obeyed the law, why doesn't some one make AAA Realty

and Kaye Agapion obey the law

and treat her tenants like human

1 beings?

We have decided that the court has not and will not help us. The court has

worked to our disadvantage.

te must now take things into our own hands and

seek justice for ourselves.

Pe will not sit back and continue to have our

children and sick treated this way. We will not have any person treated this

way any longer..

This notice is to inform all of the Greensboro Community of the

real state of affairs with the strike. We urge those persons in positions of

authority to act now. We urge all Black people to join us in our fight.

WE

GOT NO

PROTECTION

FROM

THE COURT.

WE

GOT

NO

FROM

THE SHERIFF'S

THE

REFUSED

AAA TENANT STRIKE

TERRODIS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY

Evictions and padlocking are occurring

every

day in the Black Community.

the

persons that have had their homes padlocked

'are menbers of the, AlA rest strike. Kay

Agapion of AlA Realty is padlocking and evic

ting tenants who are on a rent strike to

gain better living conditions and fair

rental prices. MA Realty chilms that tenant

have not paid their rent into the special

escrow account. This is simply not true;

most tenants on the strike are paid up but

they are still getting evicted. Men, won

and little children are being put into the

street. Black People are out of homes that

they have paid to live in.

Paul Gibson, of the sheriff department has

denied locking out children, this toojig al

false. You can check for yourself. The

Greensboro Daily News and Record have not

given an accurate account of the strike.

In the last two weeks the news media

has refused to print the. cold truth of

the evictions and crude treatment

given

the AAA tenants. A list.of 28 AJA Realty

tenants

were

scheduled

for eviction on March 9th 1970. Now, at least 15 of those Tenants

On March 12, 1970, Lieutenant FORD advised that there

had been some evictions of All Realty tenants in the past few

days and he had learned that in at least

three or four instances

Negroes had gone back to the

houses that had been padlocked,

had broken off the locks, and had moved

the tenants back into

the houses. AAA Realty Company had not

made any efforts to

further evict

these particular tenants, but the situation was

very teuse.

T-I advised on

• NAPOLEON JOHNSON nad prepared both ot

the leaflets that nao

been distributed in the Negro sections relative to the ad

Realty Company. He said these had been passed out all over

the Negro section and that tempers were rising as far as the

AAA Realy Company was concerned.

On March 12, 1970, T-l navised that there would be

a mass meeting in the

Negro

community on Ross Avenue relative

to the strike.

T-I stated that the real difficulty was that

a number of tenants claim that they had made their payments

tO AMA Realty Company through the Greenstoro Association of

Poor people,

but that the money they had paid had not been

credited to

their account.

said at least for or five

individuals claimed that they were all paid up in their rent

and yet were being evicted, and this was being used as an

issue by the black conmunity generally in its opposition to

AAA Realty Company.

, C

On March 13,

1970, Lleutenant S. N. FORD advised

Mr. B. J. BATTLE, representative of the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People (NACh), had obtained

a parade permit on the morning of

March 13, 1970, fOr a

parade to be held at 6 p.I.,

that evening.

The purpose of

the parade was to protest Ald Roalty Company and BATTLE had

told the police Department that he

estimated there would be

approximately 200 participants.

The permit was granted for the parade to be held

from the Negro section of Greensboro into

the downtown

area

of Greensboro and back to Hayes Faylor INCA for a mass protest

meeting on the evening of March 13, 1970. Lieutenant FORD

pointed out that Hayes Taylor YMCA is located immediately

adjacent to A & I State University and he felt that although

a permit had been granted for only 200

participants in this

march, there might just as easily be 2,000 if the student body

at A & T State University decided to participate. He also

pointed out that NELSON NAPOLEON JOHNSON, the Vice-President

Of A & T State University student body, had been responsible

for the setting up and organizing this

whole rent strike against

AAA Realty Company and if JOHNSON waS

so inclined, there was no

doubt that he could bring & large segment of the student body

OT A & I State University off campus to participate in such a

march.

On the evening of March 13, 1970, Lieutenant S. N.

FORD advised that only 33

participants left the Hayes Taylor

YMCA carrying placards, decrying the treatment by AAA realty

Company and marched into the downtown section.

They narched

up the main street of Greensboro and then turned and

headed

back to Hayes Taylor YICA. By the time they returned to the

YMCA, 48 individuals were

participating in the narch.

Lieutenant FORD noted that THOMAS BAILEY

and NELSON

JOHNSON were the individuals who were in charge of

the march

and participated in it.

After the marchers returned to Hayes Taylor YMCA,

they dispersed without incident.

Lieutenant FORD further advised that on March 14,

1970, another march by the same group of individuals left

Hayes Taylor YMCA at 1:30 p.m.

On this occasion, there were

65 individuals participating and they walked on exactly the

same route downdown, up the main street, and then back to

hayes taylor yMcA.

By the time the marchers returned to

the YMCA, there were 71 participants.

THOMAS BAILEY and LOUIS

BRANDON were in charge of this particular march and NELSON

JOHNSON was observed in the vicinity not actually participating.

Lieutenant FORD pointed out that at the end of the

march, there were individuals who had been identified

as members

of the Black Panther Party when that organization was active

in Greensboro last year.

He recognized in the group MICHAEL

AIKEN, CHARLIE CALDWELL, ROBERI EVANS, HAROLD DAVIS.

The group sang songs, clapped their hands,

and

carried again the placards pointing out the

treatment that had

been afforded tenants by AAA Realty Company.

According to Lieutenant FORD, the group upon returning

to Hayes Taylor YMCA stayed for just a

few minutes and then

dispersed without incident.

APENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY,

Also Known As

Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

According to its official newspaper, the Black

Panther Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in

Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can take

control of the life, politics and the destiny of the black

community. It was organized by bobby

seale, BPP Chairman, and

Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton was sentenced

in 1968 to serve 2 to 15 years after being convicted of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police

officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which

further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,"

states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people. Residents of the black community are urged to

arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred

to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,

contains an editorial. by BPP Minister of Education, George

Mason Murray, which ends with the

following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth

keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement "...we will not dissent from American Government.

We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman Mao Ise-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been

established at various locations throughout the United states.

the rain approximately fifty (50) individuals participated in

the march from Hayes Taylor YMCA through the downtown section

and back to Hayes Taylor YMCA on the night of March 20, 1970,

Lieutenant FORD pointed out that the marchers appeared

to be

more militant than they had the previous week with a number

of them making obscene gestures, giving the black power sign

and shouting black power during

the march.

He also noted there

were three cars patrolling the march bearing Negro males.

They

stayed right along side of the marchers and

were obviously

acting as marshals for the march,

No incidents occurred on the night of March 20, 1970.

Lieutenant

FORD also advised on March 21, 1970,

beginning at 1:05 P.M. approximately 75 marchers again left

Hayes Taylor YMCA and marched through the downtown section

of Greensboro, North Carolina. This group, larger than any

of the previous groups, and again more militant and more

boisterous in their conduct went through the same route downtown

and then headed back to Hayes Taylor YMCA. No incidents

occurred but Lieutenant FORD stated it was obvious that tension

was building with each of these marches.

APPENDIX

MALCOLM X LIBERATION UNIVERSITY

GREENSBORO: NORTH CAROLINA

On December, 4, 1969, a source advised that Malcolm X

Liberation University

(MXLU) was incorporated in North Carolina

during June of 1969, as & non-sectarian irstitution of learning

to be located at Durham, North Carolina, and was dedicated

October 25, 1969. It was announced at the dedication that the

school would open with approximately fifty students.

HOWARD LAMAR

PULLER, a well-publicized

Negro militant, was identified as the

Director with the title of "Head Nigger in Charge" (HNIC). A

revolutionary curriculum of nation building to develop the concept

A SENIOTS

51.60/hir. and the inadequate job de-

get justice on their jobs just as

other workers do. They need your

help.

Thus far the white newspapers and television stations have not covered the

story very widely in an attempt co keep Black people from finding ouc about the

Industry's traatment of our people. These Black people need your assistance io

helo them get justice on their jobs. Eventhough they are handicapped, they do

more than a full day's work each day. Yet they do not receive adequate wages and

they must work amid dust, trash, and rubbage daily. Despite the poor working con-

ditions at the Skilciart plant,

the only first aid

available is a small wooden

box containing only a few band-aids and alcohol.

Until they decided to picket the workers had tried to get redress to their

grievances through the Employees' Grievance Committee, by writing letters to the

Board members of the Industry, and by appealing to city, state and federal offi-

cials.

They had no other choice but to openly demonstrate their discontent.

busy sThey:are depending on the Black community to stand with them in their fight

, to get justice. Don't let your Brothers and Sisters down. Here's what you can

• do to help them:

1. Siga the petition calling for an investigation of the Skilcraft

Corporation.

The petitions will he at churches, at the mass meet-

ing and at the GAPP office, 914 1/2 Gorrell Street, 275-8588.'

2. Call the Board Members of the Industry and tell them you are dis-

satisfied with the poor working conditions, unjust treatment, and

unfair wages of the Blind workers. Urge them to make changos im-

mediately.

3. HELP THE BLIND WORKERS PICKET TIE SKILCRAFT BUILDING EACH DAY,

the Federal Bureau of Investigation that BLACK STUDENT UNION

(BSU) , UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS (UNLY) had decided to

tighten security and nake the records of the organization un-

available to unauthorized people. The immediate reason for this

action was that JULIUS CAMPBELL, an instructor in the Black Studies

Program (BSP), UNIV, was discovered by members of BSU making copies

of records which, at that time were readily available. The reason

CAMPBELL was copying the records has not been

made clear.

IV T-I stated the staff of the BSP, UNLV, which was

instrumental in re-activating BSU, UNLV, has

divided into two

factions of differing opinions regarding BSU operations. As a

result the membership of BSU, UNLY has split along factional lines

and

has suffered a large membership loss.

The factional split is believed to be the reason

CAMPBELL was interested in the paper records of the organization.

been unable to follow through on plans to purchase radio receivers

to monitor and follow police calls in the Negro areas of Las Vegas.

going to become victims of police brutality or other mistreatment by

police officers.

representatives of

BSU, UNLV have attended organizational meetings

of a coalition of "liberal" elements in the Las Vegas community

Black Student Union,

University of Nevada,

Las Vegas, Nevada

(BSU,

UNLV)

On December 12, 1968, a confidential informant,

IV T-I, advised that an embryo BSU was being formed on the

campus of UNIV at that time.

The organization had not as

yet sought the approval of the Student Senate or of the

University Administration.

The March 11, 1969, issue of the "Rebel Yell",

the UNLY student newspaper, published weekly, contained an

article which stated BSU was formed on the UNLV campus on

Wednesday, February 26, 1969.

The article stated that

membership of BSU will

be solely black students, whites

may attend meetings and social functions by invitation only

from one of the members.

Some of the defined goals of the BSU were set

out as the establishing. of Black pride and identity in the

students and the Black community; abolishing the myth that

Black clubs mean violence; the disbanding of the rigid Black

systam class that exists in the university.

The article

stated, "In short, the goal of the club is 'Black Brothers

Stick Together'".

The article continued that BSU, UNLY, is planning

the development of a Black Studies Program with courses in

Black History being determined by the community. The BSU

planned to form a tutorial, program and an academic committee

to be chaired by Russel! Harvey, a BSU member. The purpose

of this committee is to help Black students who are deficient in

particular academic studies and to compare differences of grade

averages between black and white students.

Getting Rid of the Rebel Mascot

On May 8, 1969, confidential informant IV T-2,

made available a copy of a "Resolution on Joint Committee",

made by the

Student Senate of the Confederated. Students of

the University of Nevada (CSUN). The Resolution is as

follows:

"Whereas the CSUN Senate has expressed its

endorsement of a Minority Studies program, and

Whereas the Senate has no Negro Senator to

represent the

vIeWs of Black Students, and

Whereas the lack of communication between peoples often

promotes misunderstanding and impedes progress in the

formation of new programs, then

Let it be resolved that: The CSUN Senate offers its services

and facilities in the form of a Joint Committee on Minority

Studies comprised of Senators

and members of Black Student

Union, should they so desire."

The Resolution, according to the source, came

about as a result of an announcement by Dr. Donald H. Baepler,

Vice President in Charge of Academic Affairs, UNLY, to the

effect that a "Black Studies Program", will be made

part

of the 1969-1970 school year curriculum at UNLV.

Confidential informant LV T-1 on May 23, 1969,

advised that the "Black Studies Program" will consist of

four courses which have been loosely identified as follows:

Study of Black Consciousness

The classes are to focus on such problems as self-

identity, leadership, vocational outlook, institutions of Black

society and special educational difficulties.

Also stressed

will be Black history, the ghetto, rural Black America, minority

political action and special economic problems of Black Americans.

On May 23, 1969, confidential informant LV T-3,

advised that the Black studies courses will be interdisiplinary

or inter-departmental, under the direct control of Dr. Baepler:

According to the informant, the instructors have not been named

and reither have the exact structures of the courses been out-

lined.

According to this informant, the decision to in-

clude a Black Studies Program in the curriculum of UNLV resulted

from three months of meetings between representatives of the

BSU, the white students and Dr.

Baepler.

On May 26, 1969, LV T-4 advised that the BSU, UNLV,

was undoubtedly responsible in large number for the Black Studies

Program.

This informant stated that the present structure

1 of the BSU, UNLY includes as leaders Russell Harvey and James

"Mc Daniel, both undergraduate students; with Jerry Chandler,

Graduate Student and Assistant in the

Physical Education

Department, and Joel Baker, Graduate Student in the School

the Muslim Movement.

"The King Movement is the movement Negroes

"We must have a program of direction to the

danger existing today in the tendency of saying we

can't build the Party.

This is untrue.

The new trends

It is reflected in this report that to al

membership in the NAACP at the end of 1961 reached

380,134, a slight decline from the 388, 331 enrollec

in 1960.

The decline reflected the impact or the

economic recession in such industrial areas as

Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. In

the turbulent southeast, there was a slight increase

in membership.

Despite widespread unemployment among Negro

industrial workers, whose rate of joblessness was

two-

and-a-half tines that of white workers, the Associa-

tion's money income from all sources remained about

the same, passing, for the fourth successive year,

the million-dollar mark.

During 1961 total paid memberships

in the

Association amounted to 380, 134. Of this

number

370,444 were enrolled in the Association's 1,494 local

branches, youth councils and college chapters

in 48

states.

The remainder consisted

of annual and life

NY I-1 on November 11, 1962, advised that

at the last session of the NALC

convention held

November 11, 1962, the convention delegates approved

a proposal that the NAIC would endorse the NAACP in

their charges of racial discrimination against the ILGWU.

The proposal, however,

its position

that all local unions in the ILGwu guilty

of job and membership discrimination should be subject

to decertification as a member union of the AFL-CIO.

"The Worker"

, an east coast Communist

newspaper, issue of December 20, 1959,

reported that CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT at a meeting

of the National Committee, CP, USA, on

December 14, 1959, was elected Vice Chairman

The substance of his remarks

"only against their own fanatics but also against all

attempts towards tokenism and gradualism.

The Negro

people, themselves, in their battle for equality,

wholeheartedly accept the support of all Americans who

stand for application of the Constitution and love for

all the people.

They realize the inter-connection of

the struggle of the Negro people for their own just

demands and the struggle of all Americans for peace,

democracy and social progress.

"Negro workers, with a few exceptions,

are

denied skilled jobs.

There is the undisputed and

shameful fact that even where the Negro workers are

employed and are members of a union, they are denied

to a hero a un.

the right to occupy postsof leadership in proportion

to their members and ability. Obviously, the trade

unions, themselves, have not

succeeded in accomplishing

the program of equal rights for the Negro people.

"The majority of the members of the House and

Senate are anti-labor and the Kennedy Administration

represents big business.

within the trade unions, themselves, and in Congress,

I'or equal rights for the Negro people everywhere will

nelp defeat new anti-labor legislation now being proposed.

That is why the Communist Party fully supports all

those proposals by the NALC, the NAACP, and other Negro

people's organizations for utilizing every and all

methods, including existing laws, to compel all

institutions, including the trade unions, to grant full

and equal rights to the Negro workers.

"We consider the above policy as a principal

guide for all Communists and we hope It will become

the guide for all trade unionists.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS gave the main report on

how this full citizenship for the Negro can be obtained

and urged that a national convention or conference be

held which would bring together all Negro organizations.

DAVIS also stated that legal victories by the NAACP have

been most decisive in the Negro liberation struggle and

the potential for further victories is by no means

exhausted.

The branch of government that has been most

sensitive to the problems of the Negro people has been

the Judiciary. Therefore, it has been through the courts

that the most

significant

strides have been made in

the Negro liberation struggle.

DAVIS stated that a time limit must be put on

the Jim Crow System in the United States.

The Supreme

court's formula of all deliberate speed

as enunciated

in the 1954 decision has just not worked.

DAVIS offered

the following proposals as possible resolutions at the

1963 NAACP National-Convention:

That the NAACP go back to the

Supreme

Court and ask for a more specific deadline.

NAACP convention held in Chicago, July 1-0, 1y03:

stated that two major ideolorical problems

One was whether mass direct action wast

It was correct to have a mass demonstration in Washington,

These

two questions, DURHAM indicated, were decided very early

DURHAM stated the NAACP convention enhanced

the position of the NAACP in the Negro peoples movement.

Both the decision of the convention and the temper of the

delegates of the convention makes this convention the most

militant almost since its birth.

The NAACP is still not

alone in the civil rights battle but It still can be

the unifying force in this struggle.

There is still

major problem of unity in the movement based on differences

of tactics although there seems to be general agreement in

all Negro organizations that the technique of mass direct

action is the technique for freedom today.

The convention

leadership, although not always in control of the convention,

always managed to appear in agreement with its militant

factions whenever they appeared.

The problem facing the Party is still the

question of isolation from the main stream and it should

be noted

that on July 20, 1963, a unified Ixont of community.

attempt to establish a permanent setup. in this struggle for

Ireedom.

The Party should help male that conference a

success

and work with its limited forces to be sure that

the Party is involved.

LIGHIFOOT Spoke and indicated that the

NAACP conventionlis part of the new development in the

Negro field.

This development of mass direct action has

been accepted as the main form of struggle in this period.

The Party should have as its policy that of trying to

influence the NAACP to be the quarterback of the team of

Negro organizatins participating in the struggle.

Party should also lend its support to the recruiting of

Negro jouth into whe NAACP. An additional new feature

coming from the convention was the call for the NAACP to

actively fight during election campaigns for the defeat of

candidates not pledged to civil rights.

"Its in the record books now. 1963 was the

best year in the 54-year history of our NAACP.

"Our Executive Secretary, Roy Wilkins, reportea

to the annual meeting,

January 6,

that paid memberships

shot past tehalf-million mark'for the first time in our

history. The most astonishing gains were made in youth

memberships, which were Increased by a whopping 47

percent over 1962.

"Complete tabulations were not in at press

time; however, as of December 24, Mr. Wilkins reported

the membership figures to be 426,301 adult members of

branches, 55,867 Jouth members, 10,562 life members and

8,026 members-at-large. This comes to a grand total

"While New York with its 12 branches in the

five boroughs enrolled some 34,011 persons, Chicago beat

out Detroit for largest single

branch honors. The Windy

City turned in 31,690 memberships; the Motor City, 28,443.

"Other branches topping the 10,000. mark were

Philadelphia, 24,481; Cleveland, 16,034;

Baltimore, 12,613;

Washington, D.C., 11,205; Pittsburgh, 10,457 and Brooklyn,

10,200.

"General income reached an all-time high, too,

with 51,513,053. Nearly O3 percent of that sum came

Irom the branches in one form or another.

"Incidentally, the branches really did a bang-up

Job on their 1963 Freedom Fund contributions, also.

operating expenses amounted

to $1,527,976.

"This means we went into the red for $14,323.

Add to that certain allocations, such as matching per

capita state conference taxes, we ended up with

$62,493 in the loss column.

"Besides breaking the 1963 record for paid :

memberships, do you know what else is on the docket for

1964? It is VOTER REGISTRATION!

"Increased voter registration activity is a

must this year,

so get busy.

At the annual meeting, Mr.

Wilkins revealed that the NAACP was responsible for

putting more than 83, 000 new voters on the rolls in the

southern states alone.

"In 1964, however, Mr. Wilkins says, we must

Increase that number many times over, in both the south

and the North.

The Secretary reminded those who attended

the annual meeting, 'This 1s a political year

Congress is playing politics with the civil rights bill

now.

our turn to play politics will come next November. '

"Although this year heavy stress will be on

voter registration, Mr. Wilkins says no phase of the

civil rights program will be neglected.

The Association

will push for accelerated desegregation of public schools,

will campaign for more and better jobs for Negroes, and

will continue

to attack discrimination in housing.

NATIONAI COMMITTEE TO REPEAL

THE MC CARRAN ACT (1963)

The National Committee to Repeal the Mc Carran

Act (NCRMA) maintains headquarters in Room 318, 431

South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois.

A source advised in May, 1963, that the NCRMA

Is the outgrowth of an Ad Hoc Committee of Initiators,

headed by Professor CLYDE MILLER of New York, who

solicited signatures to a Petition to the President of the

United States in 1962 which called for the repeal of the

Mc Carran Act.

The NCRMA held its formation meeting at

Chicago on May 18, 1963; the stated purpose of the

Committee is to seek repeal of the Internal Security Act

of 1950 as amended. As of July, 1963, its purpose is the

same.

Source advised that the Chicago Committee to Defend

the Bill of Rights (CCDBR), and its Executive Secretary

RICHARD CRILEY, gave full

support to organizing this new

organization.

At the May 18, 1963, formation meeting,

Reverend WILLIAM T. BAIRD, Executive Director of the CCDBR,

was named National

Administrator of the NORMA.

A second source advised in April and May, 1963,

that the Communist Party, United States of America (CP, USA)

Interest in NCRMA has been to give it full support and

approval and it takes the position that the Committee

composition must be extremely broad and the Party's direct

inizuence must be kept to a minimum.

The CP believes the

new Committee will serve its purpose in fighting the

Me Carran Act alone and the CP has everything to gain by

taking

this position.

The CP reportedly has agreed to make

funds available to this Committee.

A third source advised as of May, 1963, that

RICHARD CRILEY was then a member of the CP.

NY 100-7629

this meeting was to formulate plans. for the

forthcoming NAACP Convention to be held in

washington, D.C., June 22 - 29, 1904, and to

analyze the role of the CP in connection

with the civil rights struggle of the NAACP..

The meeting was opened by LESTER

DAVIS, who stated that the problems facing

the Party today in connection with the civil

rights struggle and the NAACP are twofold;

namely, to plan on the tactics and program

to be utilized in connection with the forth-

coming NAACP Convention in Washington, D.G.,

and to evaluate the role as the NAACP in the

current civil rights struggle. He pointed

out that many people have taken negative atti

tudes toward the role of the NAACP indicating

that they are not militant enough and are not

taking a direct action approach to this civil

rights struggle. At this time, the floor was

opened for viewpoints on the extent of the

role of the NAACP in connection with the civil

rights struggle and whether the Party should

continue its work within the NAACP or should

direct its activity to other organizations

who are more militant in their approach to

the civil rights problem.

JOHNASILVERBERG stated that status

must be maintained within the NAACP, but we

must also seek ways of channelizing oux

activities elsewhere in the civil

rights

struggle.

He stated

that we must not abandon

other civil rights organizations who are

active in the civil rights

struggle.

CAROLINE BALLIN stated that we owe

leadership to the membership of the NAACP.

She pointed out that the current leadership

Is not the organization but we must continue

to give leadership to the membership of the

NAACP. She stated that generally speaking,

the current Negro leadership in the civil

rights movement does not know where it is

going:

WILLIAM LXPATTERSON also stated

that the leadership of the NAACP is not the

NAACP Itself.

He stated that the struggle on

the civil rights issue 1s not simple but there

is no justification for abandoing the NAACP.

He stated that there was never a greater need

for Party people to be active in connection

with the civil rights struggle of the NAACP.

PATTERSON went on to state that the CP by

abandoning the NAACP would not break up the

NAACP but it would simply permit the current

guiding forces to do as they wish'in connection

with the Negro problem.

PATTERSON went on to

• state that we must continue our effort to

bring about unity of the Negro people now.

He pointed out various vehicles that could be

used in furthering the civil rights struggle

and mentioned specifically that we should use

to advantage in connection with the civil

rights struggle the United Auto Workers civil

rights resolution which links the plight of

Negroes to the poverty struggle. PATTERSON

also drew attention to the resolutions of an

organization named, Women Strike Ior Peace,

which links the Negro question to the struggle

for peace.

co tre stated that

He stated that we must find ways of

utilizing these resolutions at the National

Convention in Washingion to further the

struggle for civil rights of the Negro people.

OLIVER MARTIN stated that 1t would

be a mistake to pull out of the NAACP.

He

stated, however,

that the current NAACP leader-

ship is scared and are not taking chances.

He

added this current leadership was pushed into

a direct action program by the Student Non-

•Violent Coordinating Committee and they are

now trying to retreat from this direct action

approach.

MARTIN also stated that he felt

badly that he did not know earlier about this

meeting as he may have been able to determine

the national program planned for the conven-

tion in Washington; D.C., and this program

could be used in formulating tactics at this

convention.

MURIET/S IIVERBERG stated that she

agreed with the remarks of WILLIAM L. PATTERSON -

and also added that we cannot consider pulling

out of the NAACP

TED BASSETT pointed out that there

have been many attempts to follow up the

that the following items must be considered in

connection with the NAACP convention:

1.

Possibility of changing the

leadership of the NAACP at the convention even

though such leadership is not elected at the

convention.

2.

Propose activity in conjunction

with the civil rights bill now pending in

Congress

even though many Congressmen have stated

i6-

that such activity or demonstrations will not

influence their vote in connection with this

matter.

There must be demonstrative action

In connection with this

bill.

CAROLINE BALLIN stated that there

Is no format at the convention permitting change

In the NAACP leadership, however,

we should

express sentiment to indicate that a change

in leadership is necessary.

JOHN SILVERBERG stated that he felt

the national officers of the NAACP have re-

treated to the traditiona: role of striving

for legal action as opposed to direct action

In connection with the civil rights issue..

WILLIAM I. PATTERSON emphasized the -

need of utilizing pronouncements by white

Individuals and organizations in advancement

of the civil rights struggle.

He stated that

from numerous organizations

and individuals

statements and resolutions have been proposed

favoring the civil rights problem and we should

hail

these programs and call on organizations

requesting them to fulfill their statements

with action.

The following proposals were made

as possible resolutions at the NAACP Convention

to be held in Washington, D.C.,

June 22 - 29,

1964:

1. Fight any attempt on the part of

the National NAACP Office to reaffirm its role

of legal action instead of direct action in

connection with the civil rights struggle.

Point out that to rely on court action is a

retreat to grádualism.

WILLIAM I. PATTERSON spoke and

stated that he feels

and the CP álso feels

that it was not a good demonstration.

He

stated that the role of the leaders was not

good in the demonstration. PATTERSON stated

that nothing positive had come out of this

demonstration whatsoever.

PATTERSON said that the Negro civil

rights struggle should have unity of all

the different organizations at all costs.

said that this demonstration had been a big

blow to the civil rights movement in New York

City because it had shown the lack of unity

between the organizations and the civil rights

leaders.

PATTERSON stated that this demon-

stration is important enough to discuss at

future meetings of the club. He said that

the club members should have a thorough under-

standing of the demonstration and the results

of it.

PATTERSON stated that the growth of

"the Party or the Party's failure to grow will

hinge on the unity that the Party may. develop

among the civil rights forces and their leaders;

the unity between the Negro and the white; and

the unity between the Negro civil rights organi-

zations and the labor movement:

PATTERSON

•stated that if the Party does not undertake

this and succeeed, it will be crucial.

PATTERSON stated that the Party has

forses in the organizations such as the NAACP

an¿ CORE. He stated that these forces should

speak up at meetings of these organizations

and be critical of the leaders of these

organizations.

PATTERSON stated that the NAACP In

New York has about 22,000 members and CORE has

thousands and wondered where all of these mem-

bers were for the demonstration.

PATTERSON

stated that this demonstration had been spon-

the NAACP never came out in full force in

support of the March on Washington.

He stated that it appears now that

new groups would be formed to carry on the

many fronts necessary for a civil rights

struggle but that there 1s needed a unity of

,all forces to present a united front of action.

The new groups will also bring in new courses

for action to advance the struggle. PATTERSON

A meeting of the Miscellaneous

Industrial Section of the CP was held under

the name of the "Writers Club"

at 40 East 7th

this meeting, JAMES TORMEY stated-that

should concentrate in the NAACP and the Negro

American Labor Council (NALC) because we have

good contacts in these organizations, however,

1t 1s difficult to penetrate CORE or

the

Urban League because they have white leader-

ship.

TORMEY stated that we must concentrate

our efforts in mass organization work and in

our unions and even though our number is small,

each of us at this meeting should be able to

move thousands of people.

TORMEY mentioned that there is no

need to create issues because big issues are

in existence.

These issues include civil

rights, the war on poverty and the fight for

a minimum wage of $1.50 per hour, which must

be waged by the unions.

Mr. ROY WILKINS, Executive Director, ir

his report to the Board of Directors, stated

that

the achievement above all others in 1964 was the

enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the

development second in importance was the emergence

of Negro American voters as a very significant

force in the political affairs of the nation.

Among the items of highest priority in

the NAACP Program for 1965 through 1968 will be the

continuation of the voter registration.

Mr.

WILKINS further reported that in line with the

convention resolutions, the NAACP in 1965 will

continue efforts to make the Anti-Poverty Act

The convention

recognized that more than ever before the

Association's program must be a varied and flexible

one,

not tied to the

one method of demonstrations.

The NAACP Will help its branches to establish

citizenship clinics in communities across the

nation.

With the help of the Civil Rights Act,

the broad goal of these clinics will be the

assumption of full citizenship responsibilities

along with utilization of full citizenship rights.

Communist Party (CP) Attempts to Infiltrate

During April, 1905, a meeting was held betweer

in the Chicago area to aiscuss a

in t5ẻ

forthcoming NAACP Convention scheduled to be held in Denver,

colorado in June, 1905. At this meeting it was stated that it

was essential that Party activity in connection with this

Convention must be directed to the area of voting rights and

registration.

It was further stated that in the south emphasis

must be placed on greater voting registration and Negro repre-

sentation, while in the ilorth emphasis must be placed on

increasing quality of Negro representation.

stated that it may not be necessary to introcuce resolutions

as such at this Convention; however, the Party must be alert

to anend or institute discussion on ideas presented at this

Convention which come within the framework of voting rights

and registration.

NY 100-7629

During the latter part of April, 1955,

a dis-

cussion was held between two Communist Party members who

are active in the affairs of the WAACP concerning the forthcoming

National Convention of the NAACP scheduled to be held in Denver,

Colorado, in June, 1965.

During this discussion it was stated

decision must be arrived upon concerning certain issues to be

brought forth at the NAACP Convention. Among the issues

discussed were the following:

I. The question of vote - During the discussion,

it was reiterated that the decision set down by leading

Conmunist Party forces must be followed, namely, that

chere must be increased voter registration in the south

and the Party must strive to improve the quality of

represantation in the North. It was stated that the

National Office of the lAACP now appears to be ready to

assert additional influence in the political action field;

therefore, the Party forces at the Convention should

explore the possibility of trying to commit the convention

to a much broader policy for actively participating in

election campaigns.

Foreign affairs - a discussion was held

on the current Viet Nam and African crises; however,

it was

decided that this problem must be set asice until it is

deternined what forces are available at the Convention a.d.

whn would be in a position to submit such resolutions.

It was felt that known Party forces at the Convention

co:ld not present such resolutions.

3) Domestic - A discussion was held con-

cerning the establishment of multiple branches of the

WAACP throughout the United States.

It was stated that

this plan was tried in Texas and Calirornia

and has been

apparently successful.

Also, it was learned

• that the

Chicago NAACP is against this plan and hopes to present a

resolution to reject this plan. If such a plan is passed,

=3=

## Page 1121

NY 100-7629

the Chicago Branch would be broken down into five or six

smaller branches.

During this discussion, it was felt

what should the multiple branch plan be accepted, it

would bring about greater membership participation and In

this way it was also felt that Party forces could function

nore effectively in multiple branches. Lt was, theretore,

decided that all efforts should be made to back any

resolution in favor of the multiple branch policy.

Communist Party (CP)

Attempts to Infiltrate

In October 9, 1905, a CP faction within the NAACE

held a meeting

Northern Hotel, New york city.

The meeting was attended by both CP and non-CP members.

CP of Illinois,

in the Civil Rights Movement,

pointing out that the movement

had been broken down into various stages, namely: 1.

The

Montgomery bus boycott; 2. Sit-ins by students; 3. In-

volvement of labor forces in the North;

Birmingham

phase which brought about larger demonstrations in the

North; 5.

The Waits phase which brought about a new era

in the Civil Rights moveinent, wherein the spotlight for

the first time has been placed on the economic plight of

the Negroes.

It is the first time an awareness of the

economic nature of the

Civil Rights movement has been

instituted.

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT also stated that it was now

possible for the Party to influence the NAACP through direct

pressure on the membership and to force the membership

to become involved in various issues that are noù projects

of the NAACP as such, but

are projects instituted by other

Civil Rights organizations.

LIGHTFOOT went on to state that the object of this

meeting was to map out a program for decisively influencing

the NAACP in the future. He stated that it was no longer

sufficient for the Party just to be in attendance at open

VAACP affairs; it was now possible to influence the activ-

added that it was hoped that

the Party could institute this

influence in three directions:

-4-

NW 55136

Docid: 32989572 Page 1149-

## Page 1150

NY 100-7629

1. Give leadership to economic problems and in

this manner push the peace issue, noting that economic

problems can only be solved through the expenditure of

funds and these funds could be obtained by a reduction in

war spending.

It might also be

suggested that there be a cut

back in armaments and use these runds to alleviate economic

problems.

2. Force the NAACP to become active in all Civil

Rights struggles not just in those struggles which are

initiated, organized, and run by the NAACP.

The NAACP

in the past has been

hesitant to actively engage in Civil

Rights

struggles that are not initiated by the NAACP.

3. Attempt to get the NAACP more firmly involved

in political activity.

LIGHTFOOT questioned the group whether they

thought it would be feasible to develop a "left caucus"

in various branches of the NAACP and the group felt that

this was possible. It was stated that there were 13 branches

of the NAACP in New York and possibly a "left caucus" could

be developed within these branches.

Also, it was stated

that it might be possible to develop such

a caucus within the

Chicago NAACP. LIGHTFOOT stated that he felt he could

develop such a caucus on the west coast, in Baltimore, and

In Detroit. LIGhtFoOr mentioned to the group that he

thought the group should again meet some time in the early

part of 1966, in order that a planned program can be

developed, in connection with the next NAACP National

convention, in order that the impact of the farty program

might be felt at the next NAACP National Convention.

Michigan. Some

member's.

This meeting was held to discuss strategy

and plans in connection with the forthcoming NAACP

National Convention to be held sometime during the

Summer of 1966.

This meeting was quite informal and

there was no prepared agenda.

Individuals in attendance at this meeting

held discussions concerning the following matters:

1. Ways and means of developing a caucus

that will

be able to function at the forthcoming

NAACP National Convention.

In order to develop this

caucus it was felt that the recently approved decen-

tralization of some branches must be ironed out in

order that all branches may become decentralized.

It was felt that the CP would be able to function

more efficiently under the decentralization plan.

It was pointed out that while the Detroit Branch did

not vote for decentralization it was felt that should

there be changes effected in the structure of decentrali-

zation the Detroit Branch would go along with such a

plan and in this way there would be unity throughout

all NAACP branches.

2.

Concerning the peace issue, it was stated

that the Party could not approach this issue from a foreign

policy aspect; however, this issue should be approached

in relation to anti-poverty programs and educational

programs pointing out the need for expenditure of

additional funds for these purposes and withdraw funds ear-

marked for foreign policy to accomplish this.

3.

Concerning the resolutions committees, it

vas also decided that where possible the Party shoulo

compromise and give up membership on other committee:

in order to obtain delegates on the resolutions committee.

It was hoped to capture the four regional delegates to

the resolutions committee in the Midwest area even if it meant

losing membership in other committees.

It was also stated that every effort should be

made to place acceptable members on the NAACP Board

located in New York, since under New York laws the Board

is solely responsible for running the organization.

It was also decided at this meeting that if pos-

sible all individuals present would attempt to attend similar

meeting, tentatively scheduled for sometime in February,

1966, In New York City.

NAACP 57th Annual Convention

July 5 - 9, 1965 at Los Angeles, California

At the July 8; 1966, session of the Convention,

a leaflet was read at the Convention, which had been aistributed

in Portland, Oregon, advising citizens to take up

• arms and

defend themselves against police brutality.

The leaflet was

signed by the

"Communist Party"

• At this point, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT

ran down the aisle to the microphone and identified himseli as

"an officer of the Communist Party

association with the handbill read"and as such disclaimed any

JUlT

A meeting of the Lorraine Hansberry Club,

ut 01 dolinois, was held on July 19, 1906, in Chicago, Illinois.

At this meeting, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, a leading functionary of the

CP of Illinois:

Administration. This Convention was tied hand and foot to

the JOHNSON Administration. The NAACP leadership had the

following objectives for the Convention:

1, Conley and attack the concept of black power

Du? the ranks of the Negro peop

3.

Irat fear in any white supporters to may

be considering supporting the concepü of

black power

LIGHTFOOT concluded that it would be premature for

the OF to abandon work in the NAACP

in spite of the many problems

that trist. He indicated that he had been to New jork for a

National Board meeting to report on the NAACP Convention. The

Party's position on the topic black power is not to clash with

the Party does not agree

The party will continue to work in all movements that are

fighting for political representation for Negroes on the

question of self defense and non-violence.

E. Power Struggle in NAACP

National Organization

This source furnished information on October 31,

1966, that there are some persons in the NAACP who want to

direct the organization toward a more militant approach to

the civil rights program.

This movement has been brewing

for sever:l yeirs and came into the soen during the NAACP

National convention at Los Angeles, California, in July,

1966. However,

resolutions leading to a change in NAACP

policy were defeated in committee and never sot to the floor.

NY 1-3

October 31, 1966

commenting on the recent New York State conference

01 NAACP neld in Lido Beach, New York, in October, 1966,

this source stated that the leadership of the New York

State Conference tends to be of a somewhat dissident kind

within the NAASP.

The state leadership is interested in

increasing its influence

on the National Board in opposition

to what they termed the "establishment."

A group within the

NAACP callad the "Young Turks" aim to bring

'new blood" into

the national organization.

* Rebellious Youth Division."

The article related that members

of the NAACP Youth Division walked out of the New York State

• Convention of the NAACP chapters held October 23, 1966, at

Lido. Beach, New York. The 157 teenagers in the Youth Division

returned later with a group of resolutions that were adopted

by the delegates to the State Convention. Dr. EUGENE I. REED.

State Chairman of the NAACP, said their resolutions were far

superior to several general

and vaguely worded resolutions

submitted by adult-led committees.

The Youth Division aimed

at dealing

With the problems in the Ghetto and to make con-

crete suggestions fos slun improvement now."

Concerning the January, 1967 elections on the

National Board of the NAACP, the

"conservative element"

was victorious over the younger "progressive element.

EXTENT CE COMMUNIST PARTY

INFLUENCE IN NAACP

A. - Assessment of Communist Party

PoliCy Regarding NAACP

The Communist Party, United States of

USA), has always been interested in

America (Oto get connected with movements of groups

attempting

with the aid of entrenching its own leadership and

drawing on that movement for members to join the CP.

It is especially interested in the militant type of

groups and considers these elements as already quite

advanced ideologically in terms of recognizing the need

for militant action.

The CP favors the growth and

expansion of groups who oppose United States intervention

in Vietnam and winose policies generally are opposed

to the JOHNSON administration.

At the same time, the ce moves as carefully

as possible in ordernos to antagonize the

ser time,

moderate section

of civil rights movement such as the NAACP.

NY TH 7

November 23, 1966

Juring mid July, 1966,

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT*,

Chairman of the Illinois District CP, referring to the

NAACP National Convention held in Los Angeles,

California, in July, 1966, said that in his judgment

the NAACP reached an

'all

time low" for the NAACP.

LIGHTTOOT, however, stated at that time that it would

be premature for the CP to abandon work in the NAACP

in spite of the many problems that existed.

Regarding Communist Party

pamphlet entitled,

The following quotation is

set forth on the back of the

cover page of this pamphlet:

"As in the past, the Association

will employ every reasonable measure in

keeping with democratic organizational

principles to prevent the endorsers, the

supporters and defenders of the Communist

conspiracy from joining or participating

in any way in the work of the NACP.

"Resolutions, 47th Annual

NAACP Convention

San Francisco, June 26, 1956"

The pamphlet deals with a refutation of charges

that the NAACP is

Communist dominated"

"subversive"

It sets forth the following arguments

against any allegation of CP influence or control

in the NAICP:

"The NAACP position on the Communist Party

is clear and unequivocal:

The NAACP is not, and never has been,

Iisted as subversive by any Federal official or agency.

"2. The NAICP was established and its basic

anti-segregation program formulated before the Communist

Party of the U.S.A, was organized.

"3. The NAACP is not now, and never has

been, in any measure dominated by the Communist party.

A source who has furnished reliable information

In the past on August 1, 1958,

stated that as a result of

the split in the Johnson Forest Group (JfG), which occurred

in 19bb, two factions emerged, the Johnsor

Faction and the

Forest Faction.

According to the source, the Johnson faction

was composed of the followers of C. L. R. JAMES, als

nown as James Johnson, and the Forest Faction was composec

of the followers of RAE DWYER, also known as Freddie Foest.

The co-founders of the JFG were C. L. R. JAMES, also known

as Johnson, who was deported from the United States as an

undesirable alien in 1953, and RAE DWYER, known as Forest.

The JEG has been designated pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.

A second source who has furnished reliable

information in the past,

advised on November 26, 1962, thac

subsequent to the split

in the JFG, the Johnson

Faction

took the name Correspondence Group, which continued until

February, 1962, when this group again split with the

majority aligning themselves with JAMES behind the leader-

ShiP OI MARI'IN GLABERMAN of Detroit, Michigan, and the mincity

group aligning themselves behind the lcadership of JAMEs

BOSGS.

On February 18, 1965, this source advised that on

February 8, 1965, he had

learned that the Correspondence

croup,

whose national Chairman was JAMES BOGGS, has ceased

operations completely and no longer maintans headquarters

at 7737 Mack, Detroit.

This source reported on July 18, 1962, that the

majority of individuals under leadership of MARTIN

GLABERMAN at Detroit,

Michigan,

who formerly belonged to

the Correspondence Group

had taken the name Facing

former members of the Group at New York hed met informally

in support of the Detroit

group,

which had isnued neither

directions

nor instructions.

The New York Group nas no

officers or headquarters.

On March 7, 1963, the same source advised that

the Facing Reality Publishing Company or Committee seeks

to create a Marxist society based on the dialectical con-

cepts of Marxism-Ieninism as interpreted by C. I. R. JAMES,

establishing government by a Marxist political party.

The

prime movement in securing the support of the people is

considered to be used by the workers in their daily fight

against capitalism. This group rejects the vanguard party

concept of Marxism and has established te theory that trade

unions keep the workers under subjugation by preventing

their channeling of their own efforts to take over the

means of production and through this to in turn take over

governmental processes. This group rejects all present

forms of governments, except those

new nationalist govern-

ments, as capitalists, or in the case of Russia, . State

Capitalist.

On May 4, 1965, the same source advised that the

Facing Reality Publishing Committee continues to meet at

3513 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.

between the legitimate activities and those espousing

the CP line.

The above letter further pointed out that where

evidence of local infiltration was developed, the case should

remain in a pending status. In the event no evidence of

infiltration was developed, a letter so advising would be

sufficient, however, the offices should remain alert for

-ibsequent

information. The letter stated that the matter

should be followed and the Bureau and NYO advised every six

months by report or letter as to the situation.

In the interim,

any pertinent information received or. developed should be

furnished the Bureau and NYO.

This letter further instructed the NYo that after

the initial 50 day period, the NYO should prepare a report

setting forth a summary of all pertinent information reflecting

the CP infiltration of the NAACP on a nation-wide basis, which

procedure was to be followed every six months, on October 15

and April 15.

It is noted that the past history o: the CP, USA,

remonstrates that once the party has selected a target for

infiltration in an attempt to influence policy, it has rarely

been able to accomplish its objectives with any degree of

subtlety.

Extensive investigation has been conducted by the

NYO since 1954, on the basis of Communist infiltration into the

NAACP, and to date a review of this case file in the NYO and

of the reports submitted from other field offices to the NYo,

reflects that over the years the success achieved by the ce in

infiltrating the NAACP is almost non-existent in that it is

weak and ineffective, and no known CP influence is in evidence.

There

has been no evidence reported to indicate that the CE

dominates, controls or has infiltrated the NAACP to an extent

where they are promulgating policy, and in addition thereto,

III. EXTENT OF COMMUNIST PARTY (CP)

INFLUENCE IN THE NAACP

The CP, USA, cannot infiltrate the NAACP as far

as a policy making position is concerned, due to the complex

democratic structure of the NAACP.

The CP may have, at one

Time, attempted to infiltrate the

NAACE, but at this time does

cot nave a chance to infiltrate any policy-making position,

inasmuch as anyone with any indication of sympathy toward the

cp or one who follows the CP line, is stopped at the branch

level, thus preventing any CP member or sympathizer to gain

policy-making position.

Due to the NAACP structure,

infiltration

oI the NaaCr is not possible, and any attempts of that nature,

over the years, have been stopped in the early stages.

The NAACP holds annual conventions which are open

to the public, and although observers may attend the convention,

observers do not and cannot present resolutions to the convention.

The only resolutions presented, are those made up by the

resolutions committee at their own private meeting, which is

neid separately at the time of the convention.

The Resolutions

Committee is a body of 35 individuals selected by the delegates

to the convention,

and they are identified at the convention by

and are well known to one another.

In the event a

delegate attempted to obtain a fraudulent badge, it would only

be a matter of minutes before the impersonator were discovered.

- 11 -

## Page 1265

NY 100-7529

With regard to the delegates elected from the

seven geographical sections of the country, there are approxi-

mately 1500 delegates chosen from the numerous chapters of

the NAACP, within the geographical sections.

Each chapter,

according to its size, elects its respective number of

delegates

to attend the convencion.

Each delegate is chosen

on the basis of his long tedious work perforned in that

respective chapter, and in all cases the delegate is well

known within the chapter for the type of work he has periormea.

If for any reason the individual does not conform to the

policy of the NAACP at that level, he is soon discovered and

in a short time is relieved of his membership in that chapter.

Ine delegate, consequently, is one chosen who would best

represent that chapter, and in numerous instances, has beer

the same delegate chosenyear after year. The delegate is

an individual who performs years of

work within the chapter,

Is never one who has just joined a chapter, and the duties

ne performed according to NAACP policy, are checked long before

he would be nominated and voted as a delegate.

Once the delegate is elected to attend the convention,

he is considered one of about 1500 delegates.

At the convention,

the delegates themselves vote among themselves and elect 35

oi their delegates to the Resolutions Committee. If by chance

one of the delegates were not screened at the chapter level,

he would certainly be screened at the National Convention long

before he could become one of the 35 delegates to the Resolutions

Committee.

When on the Resolutions Committee, any policy

presented which does not conform to the NAACP policy, or it

oy some reason one of the delegates presents a resolution at

that level, which conforns to the CP line, he is immediately

questioned

at the Committee level, prior to bringing the

resolution before the National Convention.

In the past, there

have been individuals who were elected as delegates who

advocated some type of militancy, but were soon discovered

and

eased out of the organization, long before they ever could

become a member of the Resolutions Committee.

## Page 1266

NY 100-7529

Once the Resolutions Committee votes, agrees, and

presents a resolution before the National Convention,

observers who are not members of the NAACP may ask questions.

This questioning does not in any way dictate policy, because

even 1I the Resolutions Committee votes and agrees to present

a particular resolution, the final approval rests with the

Boara of Directors of the NAACP. The Board of Directors can

easily disapprove any resolution at that level. Any policy

of the NAACP rests with the Board of Directors

of the NAACP.

The Board of Directors of the NAACP meets four times a year,

and the Executive Committee of the NAACP meets monthly.

Executive Committee is composed of top functionaries of the

NAACP who are the top echelon from the various districts of

the United States.

The Executive Committee reports to the

Boara of Directors, consequently anyone on the Executive

Committee is one of long outstanding leadership in the NAACP,

who has come up through the ranks after numerous years of

levoted

service and one who is well known among his associates

for the duties perfomed. The Executive Committee seldom

changes from year to year, with the exception of ill health

or death, at which time a replacement is chosen based on his

years of service,

devotion, and his notoriety, in the respective

area where he resides. Members of the Executive Committee are

screened by the Board of Directors of the NAACP, long before

they are approved and appointed.

The NAACP carefully notes, through their own means,

the latest line dictated by the CP,

and if fos any reason

suspects an individual of following their line or being

sympathetic toward the CP, he is carefully eased out of the

NAACP and his membership therein is cancelled.

There is no CP influence in the NAACP and the CP

has no possible means of infiltrating the NAACP in any

policy-making position whatsoever.

It aims to continue the

cultural, fraternal and civic activities of these

The Political Committee,

CPUSA, in a letter dated

October 20, 1971,

Committee Members Addressed to "All Districts and Nationa:

, stated it had established

a sub-committee

to discuss with PAUL NOVICK, Editor of the "Morning Freiheit"

the question of his Party status.

The charges against NOVICK

included his position that the 1967 Arab-Israeli war was a

war of self-defense on Israel's part; In his attitude toward

the soviet Union, particularly with regard to the dewist

question, he has

increasingly departed from the position o1

the Party so that his nationalism his led him into an increas-

Ingly anti-Soviet path; his opportunist capitulation to the

pressures of Jewish nationalism and Zionism has led him to

depart more and more from a Marxist-Leninist position and to

move in

the direction of Jewish nationalism.

NOVICK's answers to these charges included the

following:

"May I remind you that our Jewish mass organizations,

such as the Eif, embrace a mass movement reaching into scores

of thousands of members, followers, participants in celebrations,

concerts.

Many of these are mobilized for May Day demonstrations,

Soviet celebrations, as well as for Party activities for the

"Daily World". To shatter or destroy this force would only

vent at the the on cause the son era progressive movement

can easily be inagined...

The ELF and the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies

Issued a statement condemning the attacks on low-rent housing

for the poor and senior citizens uf Forest Hills, Queens, New

York.

The statement called upon the residents of Forest

Hills to withdraw their opposition to the building of low-

rent housing project or "face the ignominy of acting as racists,

despite claims to the contrary by the leadership".

Societies is the successor to the

lodges of the dissolved Jewish

People's Fraternal Order

; designated

pursuant to Executive Order 10450. It

aims to continue the cultural, fraternal

and civic activities of the former loâges.

Concerning the attempt to expel PAUL NOVICK, which

was discussed only at the National Committee meeting of the

CPUSA and did not come up at the 20th National Convention,

there seemed to be an atmosphere of pacification toward NOVICK

by HYMAN LUMER, ALEX KOLKIN and JACK KLING, members of the

•National Committee, CPUSA.

At the National Committee meeting, it as recommended

that NOVICK be suspended and after six months, if he has not

modified his views and aligned them more with CP policies and

to carry out the decisions of the current National Convention,

the suspension will automatically become an expulsion.

"Morning Freiheit"

Conference. held on February 27, 1971, at the Hotel New

New York, New York.

Speaking of the importance of

ro rusting teaders for the newspaper, novick said, in part:

"After all, the 'Morning Freiheit' is a mobilizer

and organizer! It reflects the activites of the people's

organizations. Yes it is the dynamo of these organizations.

Greater readership of the 'Morning Freiheit' means

greater

membership for the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies, for

the Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs, for

the Yiddisher Kultur Farband. The affairs run by all these

organizations would not be possible without the 'Morning

Freiheit'. A reader of this newspaper is informed about

all these activites, is capable of being a factor in the

Jewish progressive movement, and in the Jewish community

as a whole

opened up this recapitulation meeting by dealing

with the question of youth participation in the

National NAACP Convention.

He cited the failure

of the NAACP organization to integrate youth into

the NAAP

and accept them as fellow citizens of the

organization.

The youth had a separate Convention, which

was held at the Henry Hudson Hotel, but no effort

was made to get them into the Convention itself.

MARTIN stated that the CP also failed on this point

because no effort was made by the

Party to bring

youth into the Convention either.

MARTIN continued stating that he made a

motion on the floor of the convention to try to have

one youth on each committee set up by the convention.

This motion was agreed to in principle but was not

formally adopted as such as there was no vote taken

on it.

In discussing the question of the WILLIAMS

Case, MARTIN stated that he thought the WILLIAMS

question hau been pretty muchthemajor issue at the

Convention.

He recalled that he had made a plea in the

defense of

WILLIAMS on the floor of the Conventions

but. no one at the convention wanted to repudiate the

action of the National Board concerning WILLIAMS,

and he was dismayed at the speed at which it reached

a decision.

It has been customary to study such situations

and get the facts before making such a far reaching

decision with such national publicity involvea.

MARTIN

suggested that the national leadership adopt a

policy of not acting with such haste.

According to the informant MARTIN further

suated that the national leadership had moollized very

thoroughly and had done a good job on WILLIAMs.

He was disappointed in the Farty's action at the

Convention. He pointed out

the party's failure

to send adequate forces and the failure to send

people to the Convention to se floor leaders, who

could act

"It is to be regretted that A. PHILIP

finger at the main enemy. By no stretch of imagination

can Communists be put into a picture with the Negro

"Red-baiting has been elevated above Negro-

baiting as the most important of the divisive weapons,

used by reaction to split the ranks of all who seek to

human rights. Certainly it has no place in the

program of an organization sympathetic to the colonial

and bad points. According to WEISSMAN, WILLIAMS has told

the swP that he would not be a puppet which is a good

point, since the SWP does not want à puppet but an

independent thinker.

WILLIAMS is a man of principle and

a courageous fighter. The bad points are that he is

stubborn and will not retreat and is given to ofi-the-culi

statements which he refuses to modify. It was this trait

that the NAACP Bureaucrats were able to take

advantage of in the defeat which they handed WILLIAMS

at the convention.

WEISSMAN stated that the NAACP leaders

At though

WILLIAMS nad, after much persuasion, been convinced to back

down on his position, the NAACP leaders read from the

original statement and asked WILLIAMS whether he still

WILLIAMS refused to back down.

WEISSMAN further stated

that at the opening of the Convention WILLIAMS may have

to back down

and his association with the legro

great possibility for the left.

WEISSMAN concluded by stating that although

the Convention was a decisive defeat for WILLIAMS and

a complete victory for the NAACP leadershiy, it showed

that the well-to-do Negroes such as lawyers, ministers,

there were about 45 persons present at the meeting which

had been called under the sponsorship of the Brooklyn

NAACP Branch.

The opening speech was made by TED POSTON who

spoke of his own knowleäge of the Willie Reid case and the

methods of Florida justice.

He urged everyone to get

behind the campaign to prevent WILLIE EID from being

extradited: to Florida where he can only expect certain

death because he had incurred the emity of the sheriff,

the legal officer who began the extradition proceedings.

One of the lawyers who is representating WILLIE

REID, gave most of the details of the case.

WILLIE REID

had been arrested in a gambling house which was well

known for its dishonesty.

He was winning when a fight

broke out in which WILLIE defended himself with a knife.

He was arrested and tried

in less than five minutes without

benefit of counsel.

Florida law provides a penalty of

one year for the crime he should have been tried for.

However, he was charged instead with assault with intent

to kill

which carries a

• penalty of fifteen years. According

to the attorney, REID was sentenced to the chain gang

and after serving two years escaped and came to New York.

Extradition proceedings are now being brought against

• him.

The informant stated that GEORGE WEISSMAN spoke

as the Secretary of the

Defense Committee and told of plans

for the petition drive.

formation of the committee and actually were its driving

force.

The informant stated that it was his opinion

that the SWP in New York hopedto utilize the committee

as a propaganda outlet for its own aims and purposes.

The informant stated that practically all of the

work done in attempting to obtain signatures for the

petitions was carried out by various members of the

New York Local, SWP. He added, however, that the campaign

"never caught fire"

inasmuch as it was

later found to be

extremely difficult to talk a person. into contributing

or signing a petition in behalf of WILLIe REID.

This

public apathy, according to the informant, was

based

primarily on the fact that the WILLIE REID case was not

strong enough due to the fact that REID had actually

committed a crime and there was no death penalty involved.

NY I-2, on October 28, 1959, advised that the

SWP, New York Local, held a class in Marxist studies on

October 18, 1959, in Brooklyn,

New York.

The informant also stated that the class was conducted under

the auspices of the SWe for contacts, particularly Negroes,

in the Brooklyn area, especially those in and

around

the Brooklyn NAACP Branch.

The informant aavised that

the class was viewed by the SWP, New York Local, as the

basis for a future branch in Brooklyn. The space for the

class was rented by LEO ADLER as living quarters for Comrade

LEO and the cost for the space would be born by Comrade

LEO and the Party. However, it was expected that those

attending the class would be contributing 50¢ a session

which money, along with the money from Comrade LEO, would

more than pay for the rent.

WORKERS WORLD PARIY

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on

February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority

stoup, under the leadership of National Committee member

Sam Ballan, known in the SWP as Sam Marcy, split from the

SWP.

The source stated that this minority group, re-

ferred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program

and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics

and interpretation of political events, split from the

swp an the grounds thai the party was liquidating itself

by departing from the Marxist precepts of Leon trotsky ano

retreating from the fight for the world socialist revolu-

tion.. The final issue which ultimately forced the split

was the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment policy

which involved cooperation with the Communist Party (CP)

periphery - individuals characterized by the minority as

petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source, ad-

vocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and

has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with

a complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of over-

throwing capitalism in the United States and throughout the

world.

on June 10, 1959, the source advised that this mi-

nority group had chosen the name Workers World Party with

headquarters located at 46 West 2lst Street, New York, New

York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the

Attorney General of the United States pursuant to Executive

action organizations in various countries

endeavor to carry out the objectives of

the world.communist movement by bringing

about the overthrow of existing govern-

ments by any means. The communist orga-

nization in the United States - the

CPUSA - pursuing its stated objectives,

presents "a clear and present danger to

the security of the United States."

The

subversive Activities Control Board, es-

tablished by Section 791 of the above Act,

found the CPUSA to be a communist action

organization.

This finding was upheld by

the United States Supreme Court in June,

1961.

The CPUSA has continued to be an

arm of the international communist move-

ment dominated by the Soviet Union. The

CPUSA, in its dependence on the soviet

Union, has never knowingly adopted a

position contrasy to soviet policy.

Its

leaders frequently confer with Soviet

• leaders to receive guidance and direction

on the policies the CPUSA is to follow.

There has been no evidence that the primary

aims of the CPUSA as they, conform to soviet

objectives, have changed over the years.

MOLLIE GOLDSTEIN attended a meeting of the

Allerton Club, Bronx County, CPUSA, on

Among the progressive

Jewish organizations protesting

were the Jewish Cultural Clubs

others.

The protest was in the form of telegram asking the

Ambassador to ask the government of the soviet Union to nullify

the death sentences and to lessen the jail sentences of the

other Jewish defendants. The telegram pointed out that the

extremity of the sentences "has astounded many supporters of

peace,

coexistence

people who want to worsen relations between the Soviet Union

and the United States."

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Also Known As

Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

According to its official newspaper, the Black

Panther Party (BPP) was started during December; 1966, in

Oakland, California, to organize black people so they

can

take control of the life, politics and the destiny of the

black community.

It was organized by BOBBY SEALE, BPP

Chairman, and HUEY

P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense,

NEWTON was sentenced

in 1968

to serve 2 to 15 years after

being convicted of manslaughter in connection with the

killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther", which

further describes itself as the "Black Community News

Service",

states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people. Residents of the black community are urged to

arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,

contains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE

MASON MURRAY, which ends with the following:

"Black nen.' Black people, colored persons of

America, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedom

; everywhere. Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the

pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement, "

...we will

not dissent from American Government.

We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106

Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been

established at various locations throughout the United States.

Vice-President of the

Brooklyn council of the Elf, was the Chairlady.

EPSTEIN stated the ELf' was

paying homage to EMMA

LAZARUS, the champion of justice and

equality.

"We try to

Implement our program to this champion.

To safeguard liberty

and Jewish-Black unity are the orders of the day.

We will

fight for justice for all people.

We must end the unconstitutional

war in Vietnam"

She mentioned the ELF helping financially

the black hospital workers in South Carolina.

The first speaker was BARBARA COLTON of the

American Jewish Congress. COLTON stated her inspiration

was the March on. Wasnington in 1963, when she found her

inentity as a Jew.

She stated that today Jews must involve

themselves in good relationships between Jews and blacks in

all communities.

This Jewish-Black relationship is being

strained today

with the rise of black anti-semitism.

This

has come about because of Jewish landlords in the ghettos

and the number of Jewish teachers.

She claimed Negroes are

basically Christians and "anti-semitism is a disease of

Christianity"

• She stated black power is a search for pride

and identity.

The next speaker was FRANKLIN GRAHAM,

a Negro,

Director of Housing of the New

York City Commission on Human

Rights.

He told the audience "we must build a good society

where blacks and whites can move together with dignity"

He stated it is strange while white Americans wish

to give freedom to the world, here in America they refuse

• to give it to black Americans.

He claimed if we cannot

live: together we will all perish together and black racism

will not be stopped until racism is taken out of our society.

ROSE RAYNES was the last speaker.

She said the

ELF is against anti-Semitism, racism and the war in Vietnam.

According to RAYNES, the ELF

presented 60,000 signatures to

the United States Senate urging this government to ratify

the United Nations resolution against genocide. She stated

the ELF has been in picket lines to support the black hospital

workers in South Carolina. In addition, she urged the audience

to present themselves on a picket line on June 24, 1969, at

the west German Consulate, New York City, to protest west

Germany statute of Limitations

against trying German war

criminals. The ceremony ended at 3:25 p.m.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS

The ELF joined a number of organizations such as

the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies, une Yiddisher

Kultur Farband, and the "Morning Freineit"

in sending a

statement to the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C.,

the Polish Mission at the United Nations, to the Communist

parties in the European Sociaiist States

and to the Communist

parties in Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere.

The statement criticized the government of Poland

for its anti-Zionist campaign with anti-Jewish connotations.

It stated. in Poland, Jews are identified with Zionism. In

addition,

too harsh a stand is taken with regard to small

offenses by people of Jewish extraction, offenses of a kind

that is often overlooked in others.

The stetement pointed out Jews are given exit permits

to go to Israel only so that the records show the emigrants

want to go to Israel only, even if they wish to go to other

countries. It went on to

show how the leading Jewish actress

in Poland, due to the anti-Jewish climate and discrimination,

left Poland. The statement concluded as follows:

"A thousand years ago Poland extended hospitality

to the persecuted Jews of Germany and other European countries.

Now, leaders of Poland have brought matters to a point where

o the perfect an a c re

a thousand years of Jewish life in Poland may be approaching

its end.

We urge that this tragedy be averted and that Poland

be set again upon the course of

a truly socialist and humanist

approach on the national and Jewish questions."

as President of the ELF, was a

signer

with a number of organizations, of a statement adopted November 16,

1968, at a meeting of leaders and activists of New York pro-

gressive dewish organizations held at the Mc Alpin Hotel, New

York City.

The assembly authorized the sending of the state-

ment to the Polish Embassy in Washington änd the Polish Mission

at the United Nations, and to the Communist parties in the

Western Hemisphere.

The statement criticized the Polish government for

its anti-Semitic acts.

The statement concluded as follows:

"A thousand years ago Poland extended hospitality

to the

persecuted Jews of Germany and other countries in Central

and Western Europe. Now, leaders of Poland have brought matters

to a point where a

thousand years of Jewish life in Poland may

We urge that this tragedy be averted

and that Poland be set again upon:: the course of a truly social-

•Ist and humanist approach on the national and Jewish questions."

The letter to EARTHA KITT stated in part:

"The courageous stand

you took in the White

all with pride and

hope.

"Nobly, honorably and fearlessly you spoke

Ior all peace-loving people in the United States and for

all those to whom justice is dear.

You stated in conversations

with Mrs. JOHNSON and with all the assembled guests, who

were invited by Mrs. JOHNSON:

""You are sending off the best sons of the land

to get shot and crippled.

American youth is revolting

because of the Vietnam war'.

"We are told that when Mrs. JOHNSON rose to

speak, there were tears in her eyes.

Was this because

of the fact that she had sympathy with the young people?

We believe not. It was because her beautiful soap-bubbles

burst.

Criticism uf Anti-Semitic

Statements Made by Student

Non Violent Coordinating

Committee (SNCE)

In a press report on August 21, 1967: the ELF

revealed the contents of a letter of protest which they had

sent to the SNCC, objecting to an anti-semitic statement which

the student organization had recently published.

The letter was signed by Mrs. LEAH NELSON, then

President of the ELF, and was addressed to STANLEY WISE, Executive

secretary of SNCC. The letter stated:

"The Emma Lazarus

Federation of Jewish women's Clubs

protests very strongly against the astounding and upsetting

anti-semitie article in the June issue of the news letter

• of the student

Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee'.

"Such anti-Semitic statements encourage racists and

anti-semites and will bring harm not only to the Jewish

masses, but also to the Negro masses in their heroic struggle

for equality.

"We are certain that the majority of the Negro

people do not agree with your position, as it was expressed

in that article, because the just-completed investigation

by the 'Anti-Defamation League' of the B'nai B'rith showed

that in the city ghettoes the majority of the Negroes are

actually less anti-semitic than the other Americans.

"Since its founding, our organization has participated

In the struggles for equality,

justice and for the elimination

of racism, anti-semitism and all forms of discrimination.

we shall continue this just fight.

"We appeal to you to change your position."

ILSON paid tribute to EMMA LAZARUS and read a

verse from her sonnet "The New Colossus".

ILSON introduced WILLIAM I. KUNSTLER as an

attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in the

civil rights field.

KUNSTLER stated that the Negro has

reached a period in the United States when he is unable to

get any of his rights, and because of this, the Negro is

now prepared to do what the Israelis have done in the Sinai

Desert - some will call it a rebellion.

He stated that the

Statue of Liberty has faced the open sea to greet new

immigrants to the American shore since the turn of the

century. The Negro has always faced the back of the Statue

and has

asked why

The Negro

was brought here in slavery while the immigrant chose this

land for freedom.

The Negro has been in a bondage worse

than that of the

Israelites, the Negro being forcefully

separated from his wife and children.

He stated the Negro has a rocky road to climo

by himself, without the aid of the whites and wishes to

breathe freely in the eyes of the other people.

KUNSTLER stated the Statue should no longer

face the sea.

It should be turned around to face the

country, to shine on the ghettos of Detroit, Chicago, and

Watts.

The Americans, according to him, bear an eternal

scar and stigma, and must all atone for the enslavement vi

the Negro. His enslavement has no equal, whether it would

have been under a czar or Hitler. The African boy wondars

whether it would have been better for him to die in the Nazi

ovens or better to suffer a lifetime as a Negro in the south.

book "Emma Lazarus - Woman with a Torch"

He related that over a decade has passed since

her death and her teachings go unheeded.

Racism, genocide,

and

colonial exploitation are still practiced.

He stated

that 400,000 people marched on April 15, and the Govern-

ment responded by escalating the war in

Vietnam. There

should be an end to the bombing of Vietnamese women and

children.

The Government should stop plotting the overthrow

of so-called unfriendly nations. He concluded by

"Questions

and Answers About the Progressive

, which states that for more than

20 years the children's schools of the Jewish People's

Fraternal Order (JPFO) constituted the progressive wing of

secular Jewish education.

On March 17, 1951, another source reported that

as of January 17, 1951, the school system of the JPFo was

then known as the Committee for Progressive Jewish Education

(CPJE),

the former name

beingthe National School and Cultural

Commission of the JPFO.

On September 14, 1955, the second source,

mentioned above,advised that on the

afternoon of September 13,

1955, the CPJE acceded to the demands of the New York State

Department of Insurance as liquidator of the

International

Workers Order (IWO) that the CPJE surrender itself to the State

as an asset of the Iwo.

The state, on that date, took control

and closed the office of the CPJE located in Room 903, 160

Fifth Avenue, New York City.

On January 23, 1956, a third source made

available a letter of the Service

Bureau of Jewish Education

Room 1005, 1123 Broadway, New York City, dated January

19, 1936, which reflected that although leo a certain extent,

schools serviced by the

SBJE are taught with a Marxist-Socialist philosonhy and the SBJE

is dominated by the Communist Party (CP) inasmuch as most of the

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC.

"The Southern Patriot," a monthly publication,

shows that it is published by the Southern Conference

Educational Fund, Inc. (SCEF).

"The Southern Patriot" was cited as an "organ" of

the Southern Conference For Human Welfare (SCHW) by the

Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, on

the SCHW, June 12, 1947.

The SCHW was cited as a communist front by the

Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report 592,

June 12, 1947.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW changed

the name of that organization to the SCEF, and listed its

purpose as being to improve the educational and cultural

standards of the Southern people in accordance with the

nignest American democratic institutions, traditions, ano

cratic institutions .

ideals. The amendment was dated April 20, 1946.

A source advised on March 2, 1961, that CLAUDE

a Communist Party functionary, stated at a

meeting of the communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, en

February 25, 1961, that the Communist Party is not connected

with any progressive movement but indirectly they do have

some influence in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases

of communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, aavised

on May 28, 1965,

thes during the time the SCHw was ir

existence, Communist Party (CP) members have not beer

encouraged to work in the SCEF. The source sated the

SCEF is a progressir, liheral organization, which he

considers a CP ironi crtinization because it has gone

along with the Cora.:ir, Party on certain issues,

particularly on tu: aral question.

On May 23, 2905, the second source advised that in

the past he has cousitored JAMES DOMBROWSKI, the Executive

Director of the 5056

', ¿ be a communist, if

not an actual

Communist Party menver, because he followed communist

principles.

The second source also advised on May 28, 1965, that

many people who are officials and members of the SCEF, while

liberal In their views, are by no means communists.

W.

E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMER_CA (DCA)

A source has advised that on October 26-27,

1963, a conference of members of the Communist Party (CP),

including national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois,

for the purpose of

settling in motion forces for the

establishment of a new national Marxist-oriented youth

organization which would hunt for the most peaceful

transition to socialism.

These delegates were told that

•it would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists

attracted into this new organization would eventually pass

into the CP itself.

A second source has advised that the founding

convention for the new youth organization was held from

June 19-21, 1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco,

California,

at which time the name W. E. B. DuBois Clubs

of America (DCA) was adopted.

Approximately 500 delegates

from throughout the United states attended this convention.

this organization, as set forth in the preamble

"It is our belier that this nation

can pest solve its problems in an atmosphere of peaceful

coexistence, complete disarmament and true freedom for

all peoples of the world, and that these solutions will be

reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic

elements in our country, composed essentially of the

working people allied in the unity of Negroes and other

minorities with whites. We further fully recognize that

the greatest threat to American democracy comes from the

racist and right wing forces in coalition with the most

reactionary sections of the economic power structure,

using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy

the unified struggle of the working people."

Over the Labor Day weekend, 1965, the DCA held

& conference in Chicago, Illinois, and a new slate of

officers was

elected to

the National Executive Committee

(NEC) of the DCA. Since Labor Day, 1965, identities of

those serving on the NEC has varied; however,

according

to a third source as of May, 1960, thirteen of the fifteen

members of the NEC were

members of the CP in the San Francisco

Bay area.

As of May, 1966, the headquarters of the DA was

located at 1830 Fell Street, San Francisco, California.

YOUTH AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM

A confidential source advised on March 29, 1965, that

the Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF), formerly known as the

Anti-Fascist Youth Committee, was established by the

Workers World Party (WWP) in

the summer of 1962, to bring

college and high school youth into the periphery of WWP

activities and thereby gain recruits for the organization.

A second confidential source advised on October 23,

1964,

that a flyer distributed by the YAWE describes that

organization as a militant organization of young workers and

worker-students for combating war and fascisn.

The first source advised on March 9, 1966, that

the YAWE maintains its headquarters at 58 West 25th

Nazism and anti-Semitism. It is now a continuing organization

springing into action when the need arises.

On February 9, 1965, a Special Agent of the Federal
