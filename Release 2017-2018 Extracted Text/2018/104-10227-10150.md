Dr MIRO remarked that over a raonth ago he had made a request
to Clark for arma for the anti-Cactro incuryenta in the iscambray, but
to date had heard nothiny rolative te the request. He commented wryly,
“I a0% but never hear an auawor.” He eaid that the (ightero there should
be supported. Er, MIRC stated that he had a boat {provided by us) and

Or. MIRG oald thers was no way to determine the accuracy
of the figures givon of planes, guns, etc, received jrurm thu Soviet bloc
{and Raly sad Canada) but even tf the figures wore skaggeratod 109 per
tent, they would still be impressive,

Ho addod that Castro ie daily becoming stronger militarily
with wedpoas' and with a taro militia ef Close to 303,000 being trained
te use them while the economy Coutinues to deteriorate. Ferhape only
half the militia wouid be effective, But tuat is eiseable. Thus, Ne sald,

- the longer the delay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the

greater will be the task. ““e snust act soon, vigorously and effectively,
to insure victory. Another cofoat would be disastrous and would make
Capaas, Latta Ameriéaas and others believe Castro to bs invincibia,
Then would come accommodations and oven worso, the tiaplanting of
Castro-becked regimes in the homisphore, And tha U. 5, would sufier
worst of all, being discredited for defeat and “guilt of laterforence. *
“in the U® na nation would otand beside the U. 5."

6. Erogosal that Connell go to Cuba with Commando Croup and

Eatadlish a Goverment on Cubaa sail

Dr, MUG then declared that he wag convinced that Castro
wouid never be overthrown by all tho propaganda, the sabctage, commands
vaida, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating
econnmy, aad that tt was inconcetvable to.cstablish a vovernment-direnile

that all roust be well prepared in advance, there myot ba no vaciliation,

of course bia plas would have to be otudied at the. highest government

“ ealaborators,and I ouzgested that he do this so that it might be examined

and considered,

Lr. MIRL declared that he was convinced that this Comcuniat
dagger in tha side of the “tatec could only ba eradicat
that the U.3, tg and will be blamed for ail wati-Caney ja janta,
Sabotage, etc. and that enomy otaton will denounce it Yor tate rvention
to Cuba, but that if the U. 5. goes to the aid of a friendly revsictlonary
resimo establiehed In the country and.holpo it defeat the Seviet-backed
Communist regime, ail (rlesdly governmoute will applaud,

“Thavo no parsonal politica: ambitions,” declared MIRS,
“I merely am trying to chair tae Council, whose mission is to ify the
satt-Castro elements inatde aad outside cf Cuba. If tha team ien't coa-
sidered effective, thea chanze the pitcher, But [ believe the Couneil rvust

*Thanke to Castro, we got thio.* Aad they will epond tt aa in the past

and atructure-of the Propaganda Cammilesion. Ho stated that it is out-
aide the Consejo and not ‘whuor his direct control, although the Council
eccountant has been passing funds to ft. Ho sald CAISRILLC had resigned

12, MIRO'a Views Relative to Suprems Court Justice or PRIO

being Kecoznised a9 Head of a #rovisional Government

Tasked Dr, MIRO ff he believed that there were many anti-
Castro Cubads (both fm and out of Cuba) who favored PRIC,-or the head
of the Supreme Court to be the provisional president if a government were
to be established on Cuban soil. Dr. MULC declared thet the revolution
io a fact, and that practically nobody wanta to go back to any former
rogirne, . The people in Cuba would reoist any such Possibility. He das



nounced PRIC's activities scninat the Council and ito efforts te unily
the anti-Castro clements, fic gaid that the people should be given an.
opportunity to elect their chief of state after Castro's overthrow and

When. questioned about his business and private telephones, j
MIRO'sald,~"The business phone ts alec'in my house. Ihave no office : :

press, the refugee center, otc, l-would not be satisfactory. Tho FRD
fo now practically dead. It woe the foreruaner of the Cansojo ag the

After Dr, MIRC raitorated his view that he should be tho
channel for funds ‘and coordinating the activities of groups outside the
Consejo such ag the Students, FOXD (Labor), ote, I caid that I undet-
stood that ¢ome of those eloments were unwilling to function under the
sae Consojo;-and that-in-wiew of.that situation, did-he consider that an.

H Activity Committoe might be organized with a delegate. from gach of

1 theae groupe sad under the chairmanahip ofa. momber of the Consojo.:
This would serve to Coordiiate thoir activities, give them a tio-in with

i the ‘Consejo, yet not make them subservient to it. Dr. MIRC ropitod

j that this weuld merely set up another Consejo outside of and parallel to

i . the existing Consejo, I did not pursue thio (urther, not having enough

background of these organizations to be able to discuse the matter

i effectively.
