SUBJECT:

As I depart from the assignment as Chief, Non-

official Cover Branch, Career Management Staff, I should

like to make a final comment on the performance of

who has served with me during the entire period of my

assignment and who, since March 1970, has been my deputy.

More Specifically, the period since 1 January 1977 has been

a trying one for this component and has culminated with its

sudden transfer from one component (CMS) to another (ADDO/D) •

During this most recent period,

demonstrated his capacity for growth and leadership.

himself handled virtually all of the transition aspects for

involving briefings and counsel for his new

overall Chief (the ADDO/D) and for his new branch chief.

He has served in the past 30 days substantially as acting

branch chief, given my fairly lengthy TDY absence abroad

during that period. I can only reiterate my judgment in the

last fitness report that

is a senior and mature supervisory

officer, very well organized in his work habits and capable

of making measured judgments and decisions. His continuity

in all aspects of nonofficial cover and its ramifications makes

him a valued and valuable staff officer. I would say his

involving personnel, firmly and crisply.

Given his impressive field and Headquarters experience,

should be given an opportunity to display his worth in

future Directorate assignments involving discretion,

professionalism and maturity.

I give him an unquestioned "Strong"

for this final period he has served with me.

It is recommended that

standing performance as Chief of the SA Section and Acting

Deputy Branch chief of WH/o during the tension-filled days

which preceded and followed the Chilean military coup of

September 1973. The nature of

service to the

Agency during this period has been described more fully in

his most recent fitness report, which evaluated his overall

pertornance as "Outstanding."

served as Acting Deputy Branch Chief of

WHo for five months, from mid-June to mid-November 1975,

while concurrently continuing to direct the large and im-

portant catlean covert action program with exceptional

competence. L

thus was handling two exacting jobs

simultaneously during the entire coup period.

This was a

time of particular tension for the Branch, since developments

in Chile were of international importance and generated almost

daily requests for special papers and briefings for top U.S.

Government leaders.

Iperforned at a consistently

high level in both his SA and managerial capacities: his

propaganda and political action guidance was timely, imagina-

tive and effective, while his managerial decisions as pro-

visional head of a

15-man branch reflected sound judgnent

and an across-the-board foundation in clandestine operations.

A self-reliant and exceptionally talented SA officer,

was personally responsible for the creation and

Implementation of two successful Division programs -- one in

the political action and one in the propaganda field -- which

have made an important contribution to the achievement of

U.S- policy objectives with regard to Chile.

These programs

are being continued even though

Branch to handle an exacting new staff assignment.

Amplify or explain, if appropriste, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and P to provide the best basis for determining

future personnel actions.

Subject is a bright young officer who has made an outstanding contribution

to the operations of the Station since his arrival on duty.

He is unusually

well notivated and energetic in his work. He has shown a high degree of

imagination and intelligence in his direction of KUCAGE operations. He has

haadled his agents and other contacts in an exeuplary fashion.

The only factor that has had to be discussed with Subject is his need

for greater patience, tact and understanding in his dealings with fellow

NOrKerS.

Subject has great potential which should not necessarily be limited to

KUCACE type activities. His abilities and attributes are of equal value to

KUTUBE operations.

I agree with the rating officer that the subject has a

great deal of enthusiasa and interest in his job and in many

aspecte performs his duties in a highly professional manner.

I do not, however, for ronsons stated belov, belleve that

his over all rating should be higher than 4+.

While it is true that he demonstrates considerable

agination and energy, he is headstrong and develope

prejudices that prevent him on occasions fros being objective

in handling operatione. This in sy opinion 1s due to his

youth and lack of experience in daaling vith a particular

situation of the kind with which he is now faced.

by no seans meant to be a reflection on his qualifications

or future potential.

Leaphatically disagree with the last sentence of Section

E for the reasons set out above.

He should not be, at the

present time, giren greater individual responsibility but

rather sbould be subject to closs, strong supervision of a

of responsibility for propaganda matters for less than four months,

but in that

time has demonstrated an unusual ability to provide tinghative, timely and useful

propaganda guidances for covert field use. He Is very sensitive and perceptive

to the capabilities and limitations of WHD media operations and exploits their

possibilities to the meximin. He has been particularly effective in the exploita-

In this regard he has shown great initiative, imagination and professional ability.

regularly makes sound suggestions for increasing the effectiveness and

Security of WiD medie operations, and with more time on the job, and an increased

novledge of specific country operations, he should further improve his ability

to assess and review WiD projects.

FROM

Responsibilities During Assignment to

DO/Washington Base (re Fitness Report Jan 69 - Jan. 70)

1.

During the early days of my assignment to DO/Washington

Base, the matter of my cover was discussed a number of times

with DO Personnel and CCS. Eventually CeS came up with

as a legitimate

Tirm which would provide me with the needed cover. It came

out loud and clear during the discussions that this cover

would allow me to spot, assess and develop targets of interest,

and would allow me to handle recruited agents but, because

oi the nigh risk involved in the use of a legitimate firm for

cover purposes, I was not to engage in recruitments.

Despite its one limitation, the cover was ideal.

Among other things, I:

3. When the Base moved to its new offices in Washington,

the COB gave me my instructions.

He told me that I should

avoid making or maintaining contacts in the Church and Latin

American communities in Washington; that I was not being

assigned any geographical area on which to concentrate but

would be expected to use my judgment, seek out persons who

might be of interest, and take advantage of opportunities

which might arise; that I would be given recruited agents to

handle as the need arose; that, per the limitation concerning

my cover I was not to engage in actual recruitments, but

was to spot, assess, and develop persons of possible interest
