ADMINISTRATIVE

CG 6443-C advised on April 9, 1964, as follows:

Informant advised that he had recently learned

through LOUIS TORNABENE

that GUS ALEX was complaining bitterly

because of the fact that there was sonmuch heat on the strit

joints, particularly on the South Side of Chicago,

The

TORNABENEs told the informant that ALEX mentioned that he

stands to lose $120,000 per year as a result of the strip

joints being closed

down. The TORNABENEs expaäined that

"that's GUSIE's end"

The TORNABENEs further explained that ALEX and his

associates are at a loss to know precisely what to do to

circumvent the Internal Revenue's actionaand the corresponding

publicity. LOUIS TORNABENE further advised that the Crossroads,

Captain RIORDAN in the First District, he was bitterly complaining

although RIORDAN was dutifully paid off, he has remained

unscathed as a result of all the newspaper heat, and has evolved

as the only person who really made any money out of the strip

joints in the past several months. TORNABENE's actual quote

was "wouldn't you know it, the lousy cops made all the money";

THE ABOVE INFORMATION CONCERNING TRUST AGREEMENTS,

ETC.., IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE INASMUCH AS THE INFORMANT LEARNED

MOST

OF THE INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE

TORNABENE FAMILY, AND EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE USED IN THE

USE OF THIS INFORMATION.

TC-1, FRANK LA CROIX furnished the following

information on May 28, 1964, and June 4, 1964:

The following information concerning informant's

employment at 1150 North Lake Shore Drive as concerns PRIO

and Abix should be kept in strictest confidence because

should the information be improperly disseminated it could

cause a hardship on the informant,

so therefore, caution

should be used in using any of the following information:

Informant is the manager of the apartment building

at 1150 North Lake Shore Drive where ALEX resides and he

stated that in middle April, 1504. Chicago hoodlum ROSS PRIO

sought to rent an apartment

in this building.

He said that

PRIO somehow found out that he had a furnished apartment avail-

able which fact was not common knowledge. Since he knows of

PRIO's reputation, he refused to accept PRIO's application

for an apartment:

The informant is of the opinion that ALEX

was not aware of this and would not approve of PRIO's moving

in, because ALEX has always been very sensitive to any publicity

regarding him and hs residence which might alienate his

neighbors:

Informant feels that if ALEX wanted PRIO in the

apartment he would have said something in his behalf as he

did for his paramour SUZANNE FUEGER, Informant believes that

PRIO's contact with the apartment was BOB FARBER, who lives

in the same building as ALEX and PRIO frequents Al Farber's

Steak House

Informant said that SUE FUEGER has always been a

very nice girl who tries to live modestly and was quite anxious

about the amount of rent she would have to pay when she moved

into the apartment.

He said that she is attractive, pleasant

and makes a good impression:

Informant added that ALEX called him out of a

board meeting to inquire as to whether or not SUE's application

was approved!

When told that it was, he said "Thanks pal."

ALEX had previously told the informant that he would do any-

thing for him and asked him specifically if he needed any money:

Informant stated ALEX recently had some bad publicity in the

newspapers and the informant was somewhat disturbed because

ALEX's address was given and this hurts him. He feels that

SUE might be an asset to the apartment and neighbors will not

be as curious if she is in the same building as it was before

when she was frequently visiting him and passing through the

lobby

He said that ALEX has a brass plate over the lock

on his door and he, the PCI, has no key. He stated that ALEX's

apartment is the only one in the building for which he has no

key. .

He

stated that he is also aware that ALEX has a burglar

alarm on his front door also
