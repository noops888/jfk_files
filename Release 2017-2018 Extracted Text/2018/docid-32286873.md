covered over the windows and make other corrections, as
well as securing a promise that these premises will be used
for no other purpose other than a residence for the manager.
SULLIVAN commented that this building, before the corrections
were made, hdd about 1000 feet of floor space, had newly :
paneled walls throughout, four air conditioners, a ceiling
fan, a large pool table was in the center of the room, which
room had a plush red carpet, a men's and women's wash room,
and the two doors had three locks apiece on them.
