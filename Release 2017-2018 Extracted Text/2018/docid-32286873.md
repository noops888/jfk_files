The Recorder of Deeds Office, in addition, on

12/28/61 reflected that MAX and BETTY EDER executed

mortgage on the above property to the Washington Federal

Savings and Loan Association, Miami Beach, Fla., in the

amount of $28,000.00 on 12/19/61, which was filed and

recorded 12/20/61.

MM 509-C, on 12/26/61, advised that JOSEPH

INDELICATO (Miami file 92-404) has returned to the Patio

Bridge Club, Miami Beach, after a long absence and is again

playing cards and shylocking out of that club.

DANIEL SULLIVAN, Operating Manager of the Crime

Commission of Greater Miami, on 12/28/61 advised he heard

Puccini's Restaurant, Miami, Fla., opened on 12/25/61 and

so far has complied with all the requests and licenses of

the City of Miami. JOE FISCHETTI (Miami file 92-99) has

an interest in this establishment. SULLIVAN stated FISCHETTI

and his associates remodeled two small buildings into one,

which adjoins the property of the restaurant, and apparently

intended to use it for a gambling setup. The City of Miami

made them tear down part of the new panel walls which

covered over the windows and make other corrections, as

well as securing a promise that these premises will be used

for no other purpose other than a residence for the manager.

SULLIVAN commented that this building, before the corrections

were made, had about 1000 feet of floor space, had newly

paneled walls throughout, four air conditioners, a ceiling

fan, a large pool table was in the center of the room, which

room had a plush red carpet, a men's and women's wash

room,

and the two doors had three

locks apiece on them.
