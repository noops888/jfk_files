JOHN ROSELLI, aka

On 12/23/64, JOHN ROSSELLI checked into the Desert

Inn Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. His reservation was made by

RUBY. KOLOD, part owner of the hotel and ROSSELLI's expected

length of

stay was four days.

The Las Vegas Office also advised that on 12/25/64

ROSSELLI was called at the Desert Inn Hotel by JOE BREEN and

Sands Hotel, Las Vegas.

by a GEORGE PALLAY, Room 249 business associate of ROSSELLI

BREEN

is a close friend and former

and is presently employed in a bank in Las vegas. In the first

part of January, ANTHONY ROGEL, PCI, Los Angeles, furnishec

information that when he was in Las

Vegas just before Christmas

he talked to GEORGE PALLAY.

PALLAY told him that he had come

over to Las Vegas with ROSSELLI and has known ROSSELLI for many

years.

PALLAY also told ROGEL that he had made a trip to

Europe to pick up some paintings for ROSSELLI.

PALLAY said

that ROSSELLI was interested in real estate and that he, PALLAY,

would arrange to introduce ROSSELLI to ROGEL in Los Angeles

where ROGEL is a real estate salesman.

According to ROGEL,

PALLAY resides at the Beverly Rodeo Hotel, Beverly Hills,

California, when in the Los Angeles area and is reportedly a

jewelry salesman.

The Los Angeles files reflect that a GEORGE

PALLAY (not presently known to be identical with the PALLAY who

knows ROSSELLI) was

indicted in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1963, in

connection with fraudulent stock transactions.
