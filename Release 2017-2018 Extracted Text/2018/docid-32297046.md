RE: JOHN ROSELLI, aka

AR

: On 12/23/64, JOHN ROSSELLI checked into the Desert
Inn Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. His reservation was made by
RUBY. KOLOD, part owner of the hotel and ROSSELLI's expected
length of stay was four days.

The Las Vegas Office also advised that on 12/25/64
ROSSELLI was called at the Desert Inn Hotel by JOE BREEN and
by a GEORGE PALLAY, Room 249, Sands Hotel, Las Vegas. BREEN
is a close friend and former business associate of ROSSELLI
and is presently employed in a bank in Las Vegas. In the first
part of January, ANTHONY ROGEL, PCI, Los Angeles, furnished
information that when he was in Las Vegas just before Christmas
he talked to GEORGE PALLAY. PALLAY told him that he had come
over to Las Vegas with ROSSELLI and has known ROSSELLI for many
years, PALLAY also told ROGEL that he had made a trip to
Europe to pick up some paintings for ROSSELLI. PALLAY said
that ROSSELLI was interested in real estate and that he, PALLAY,
would arrange to introduce ROSSELLI to ROGEL in Los Angeles
where ROGEL is a real estate salesman. According to ROGEL,
PALLAY resides at the. Beverly Rodeo Hotel, Beverly Hills,

California, when in the Los Angeles area and is reportedly a 4

jewelry salesman. The Los Angeles files reflect that a GEORGE
PALLAY (not presently known to be identical with the PALLAY who
knows ROSSELLI) was indicted in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1963, in
connection with fraudulent stock transactions.
