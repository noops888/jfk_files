SUBJECT&

Classification of position of Chief, Latin-American

Division; Research and Analysia Branch.

Proper allocation of the position of Chief, Latin merican Division

has been under consideration by the Classification Divialon®

A request was made to the Chief of the division for complete de

calls relativo to the rosponsibilities of the position and the .

program and activities of the division.

This infornation has been

received and the functions of the division have been studied and

compared with other active divisions of the Research and Analysis

Branch such as Europe-Africa, Far Past, USSR, ete

It is the opindon of thie offlee that the studies and contributions

of the Latin American Division to the Research and Analysis Branch

and OSS are not as great as those of other divisions of R& A and

that their activities have not developed to a couparatle extent.

It would not appear at thie time that these activities were on a

comparable plane, nor would the responsibilities of the Chief of

this division carry a grade of P-8.

The position of Chief, Latin American Division, was established

In the Llbrary of Congress at Pud but has not exiated since the

transfer to OSS:

Reolassification of position of Chief of Latin American Divinion

Phia roolanal Montion dotion la based on two conalderatione:

1. There has boon a marked inerease in the oomplesty of wert

and the responalbilition of the position of Chief of the Latin Anerfas

Divinion during the past yoor.

This has to sone o stent been reflooted

In the Increase in the alse of the Division from 17 persons 1m Augurt

of last goar to nearly double that nunder at present, and the Inorense

of sootions from tro to threo. In part thim 1a also roflootod in the

largo amount of overtino now boing workod by the Diviaion. A request

for l4 new positions and the croation of a fourth Seotion, already

approved by the Direator of the Branah, do nor before the Bureau of

the Budgot.

Beginning In Hovesber 1943, the Chiof of the Latin Anerlean

Division suooostully initiated a sories of agreementa ulth the state

Department under which the Division has been preparing varied types of

economio, geographio, and political reporte, all of which lavolve ar

codingly careful negotiation,

consultation, and planning at a high

ochelon, inoluding the Chlof of the Offloe of Amerioan Republion Affalre

and hia Divioion Chlofa.®

The Chiof of the Latin Amorioan Diriaton has In addition effeotively

Introduoed o progran of Joint atudios with the Foreiga Soononlo Adain!

•tration. This progran also involves elaborate liaison relations and

planning at a high echelor, Inoluding the Direotor of the Pan Amerlean

Branch and his Division Chlofa. .

In recent wooks the Divinion for the fret time has been called

upon to undertale not only the partial exeoution, but also the diree-

tion of highest priority topographio work for the Joint Chlora of stafl..

Thia work requiring 0sS to organise and intograte the combined resource

of the Arry, Havy, and Alr Corps, has further Inorensed the noope of

profensional, adminlotrativo, and ladson responnibilities of the Chief

of the Latin American Diviiion.

The gonoral nature of the Inoroase in the work load of the Latta

randun to Li. Janes & May of 5. August,

no the request for now poalo

I ahould Like to emphasino that tho new devolopmente in the

work of the Divlelon have meant not only an inerenso in the lond to be

eartled, but also, and far more important, a conaiderablo qualitative

Inorense bearing on the aignitloance of the work, on the laportance

and coupladty of the Division's relations with outside agenoles, and

on the highor drilla and rosponsibilitios roguirod of the chiel of the

Divalon,

I have bean Informed by the Director of tho Branch that these

rosponalbilities have all been handled with marked success.

B= Tho pooltdon of Chlof of the Latin Anoriona Diviaion had a F8

olasalfloation at the time Colonol Janos loft the position and I vaa

appointed la hio place.

I wad granted a fy rating when I replaced

• Colonel Jams on the grounde that ny provious rating an Deputy Chio!.

• FROM:

Preston E. James

TO:

Dr. Willian L. Langer

SUBJECT: Promotion of kaurice Halperin

DATE July 18, 1942

This menorandum is to recoumend the promotion of Maurice

Ealperin fron: P-5 to p-6.

Halperin entered on duty in this office at the grade of

Pal on October 2, 1941.

His previous background in the Latin

'American field Includes a long-continued interest in the problems

of Nexico, especlally with reference to the program of land re

distribution.

He has made ten trips to kexico, spending a total

of two years

in that country.

He has written

nunerous reports

based on these fiold studies, the more important of which are:

under the ted in desert to December 153ated

December 1934;

Mexico The Increuble Current Mistory, November 1930; translated

in Lê Horg,

1936);

Knat About Nexico Now Republic, January

6h11915, 1938); Mocel Farng

In Mexico Current listory,

Comes to Llie

Inter-inerican quarterly.

Background of Conteiporary Lesican Literature Publications of

the jodern Languare Association of America,

Septenber 1940); and

Kexico shirts Her Forein Policy (Foreign Affairs, October 1940).

• Dr. Halperin was put in charge of the Mexico-Central Anerica

subsection,

and is the person responsible for several

of the re-

ports

on this area: khich were

subritted by the Latin American

Section.

He has demonstrated his ability both to gather a reliable

factual base and

to

irterpret these facts realistically.

He is

also outstanding in his ability to render his reports in clear,

concise English.

On February 11,. 194, Ir: Balperin mas made assistant chier

of the Latin American Section.

During the past months one of

ho mjor problems of admiristration within the section has beer

the separation of the worers from the section chief. It has

proved Imperative to maintain the headquarters of the section

at

25th and E Streets where close contact is maintained with the head

osfices of the agency and with the chief sources of information.

However,

space does not perrit the housirg of the research assis-

ants st

25tl: and E

Streets even If such an arrangesent were desir

able. The actual work of preparing reports and surveys, there-

fore,

must be

carried on in the library of Congress Annex. In

order to maintain close liaison betreen the section chief and

the staff, a conference is held at 25th and & Streets three

earnings

each

week at which the zen in charge of the five regional

subsections are in attendance.

The renallier of the staff, hom

ever, renains permanently at the inner.

Under these circumstances the assistant chief mist assume a

large seasure of independent responsibility for the actual opera-

tion of the section and for the personnel problems.

Dr. Halperin

has shorn a marked ability in this.

He has set up

simple but

effectire machirery for the performance of the tasks assigned to

the section and for the checking of individual performance with

respect to these tasks.

He has gained the respect and confidence

of the reubers of the staff because of his fairness and honesty

In desling with then, but he has not failed to hold before them

a high standard of performance.

Because of the large amount of individual responsibility

which has been placed on the assistant chier of this

section, and

because the experience of nearly & year nos denonstrates Dr.

Halperin's capacity to assune these

responsibilitles successfully,

I reconcend his promotion to P-t.

Preston E. Jases.

07 with regard to Dr.

trarice

Halperin,

a caroful investiration mas made of the case.

As none of the informants of the F.3.I. seemed to

hold the belief that Dr. Asterin was a cornist

the

crux of the

matter seoned to be that ho had been dis-

from the rectre i chat i-lition the at thereared

meeting of February 1l

the Board of kegents of that

university had reversed therselves and reinstated Dr.

Halberin as Associatr Profesor of lodern langunres

without prejudice, continuing his sabbatical leave, we

concluded that the only pininistrative action by 0.0.1.

necessary in Dr. Halperin's case mas that of exonciation

and so informed Mr. Hoover on Aaril 10.

on lay 5 Hr. Hoover wrote you that, since the

earlier correspondence

anotier informant had advised

the F.3.l.

that Dr..

alrerin's activities on behalf

of the communist movement coula be traced

back

years, and that, during

June lics, he was chosen as a

member of the connunist organization delegated to Cuba,

which he (the informant, statea was for the purnose of

carrying on subversive activites.

hen you referred

this natter to me,. I called r. Lawrence buggen or the

Depertment of State, who has handled for that Department

in 1935

the problems arising from the arrest and deporta

tion of the persons traveling with Odets. Ar. Ducren

oftered to examine the file on this case and give me

his oninion.

• In view of the nressure on his time, this

involved

some delay,

but he son informs me that,

although

some of the peoble who went miti

adets on the trip to

Cuba in 1935 may have been cornists, others ire simply

neople who mere troubled at the state

and wished to no dom to make an investication of the

unfortunate conditions in the isiand at that tine.
