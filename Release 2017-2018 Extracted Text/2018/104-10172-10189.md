SUBJECTs Classification of position of chief, Latin-aserican
Division, Research and Analy: anchs

Proper allocation of the position of Chief, Latin-imerican Division’ 7
has been under consideration by the Classification Division. i

_A request was mide to the Chief of the division for complete de-
tails relative to the responsibilities of the position and the
program and activities of the division, This information has been
received and the functions of the ‘division have been studied and
conpared with othor active divisions of tha Research and Analysis

Branch such as Europe-Africa, Far Zast, USSR, etc.

It ig the opinion of this office that the studies and contributions
of the Latin-American Division to the Research and Analyais Branch
and OSS are not’ as great as those of-other divisions of R & A and
that their activities have ‘not developed to a comparable extent.

* °. Jet would not appear at thie tine that these activities were on a : j
comparable plane, nor would the responsibilities of the Chief of i

this division carry a grade of P-8,

. "The position of Chief, Latin-American Division, was established
in the Library 6f Congress at Po but has not existed since the

Robert &. Stricklin —~ 14 August 1944

: Lt. Jame way:
| Maurice Halperin

Reolassi fication of position of Chief of Latin American Division

_ This reclassification aotion is based on two considerationa:

1. There has boon a marked increase in the complexity of work
and the responaibilities of the position of Chief of the Latin Anerican
Divieion during the past yeer. Thishas to som extent been reflocted
in the increase in tho ise of the Division from 17 persons in August
of last year to nearly double that nunber at present, and the increase
of Sections*from two to three. In part this is also reflected in the
largo amount of overtime now boing worked by the Division. A request

; for 14 new positions end the creation of a fourth Section, already

approved by the Direater of the Branch, i now before tho Bureau of
the Budgot.

Beginning in Hoveuber 1963, tho Chief of the Latin American
Division suscessfully initiated a sories of agreements with the State
Department under which the Division has beon preparing varied types of
soonomis, geographic, and political reports, all of which involve ox-
ceedingly careful negotiation, consultation, and planning at @ high
echolon, inoluding the Chief of the Office of American Republics Affairs

: nd his Division Chicfa.e

“the Chief of the Latin American Division has in addition effectively .

nie

intredused a progran of joint stuiios with the Foreiga Eoonomo
stration. This progran also involves elaborate liaison relations ‘and
planning at a high echelon, inoluding the Direotar of the Pan American
Branch and hig Division Chiefs. :

_ In regent wooks the Division for the Mrst tine has been called
vpon to undertake not only the partial execution, but also the dirac=
tion of highest priority topographic work for the Joint Chiefs of staff.
This work requiring 033 to o7geniso. end integrate the combined resvurcos
of the Army, Revy, and Air Corpd, has furthor increased the scope of
P onal, administrative, end Moieon responsibilities of the Chief
of the Latin American Division, ee :

Affairs to Maurice Halperin.

- completing one yoar

Other now fmetions added by the Miviaion during tho past yeor
inolude continuing economo studios for the Cartel Comittes ond -
requested by the oporating branches of the 038. In
tion, the Chief of the, Division has been required
to undertake special Iiaieon tasks directly for General Donovan with

“high officlale of Allied governments.

The general nature of tho increase in the work lead of tho Latin
‘American Divisien and the background of the repidly developing ericis
in Latin Aserioa justifying thie increase, are indicated in my amo-
rendum to Lt. Janes Qo May of 5.August, re the request for new poal=
tions, I should ‘Like to emphasize that the nev devolopmente in the
work of the Division have meent not only.an increase in the load te be
earried, but aloo, and far more important, © considerable qualitative
Anorease becring on tho significsnce of the work, on the importance
end complexity of the Division's relations with outside agencios, and
on the highor skills and rosponsibilitios required of tho Chief of the
Division, I havo been informed by the Dirsetor of tho Branch that these
rosponsibilities have all boon handled with marked success.

2. Tho pooition of Chief of the Latin dmorioan Division had a PS
olesaification at tho time Colonel Janos left ‘the position and I was
appointed in hie place. Iwao granted a P-? rating when I reploced

“Colonel Janes on the grounda that my previous rating aa. Deputy Chief

wader Colcnel Janos was P-6. It was understood at the time that after
sorvice.at the P-7 el, I would be eligible
wader Civil Servico regulations to assums the P-8 level of the ee
I cooupied. .

8. No. Since the duty fis based on over a decade of highly
technical training in the Lstin Anerican field, as well as on
the specialized experience gained during the past twenty conths
in the performance of this duty, no civilian capable of perform-

ing this duty adequately can be found.

9. Yes. His training and experience involve seven years of
university study, of which two were spent in Europe, and en
additional ten years of independent research, of which two were
spent in Latin America. a :

12. As indicated in no.8, the individual is of "scarce category
‘of specialized skill. His training and experience. are equalled
dy.few. people in this country. Search for personnel replacements
by this and other agencies indicates that no such people are
now available or likely to be in the future. -The-need for his
services is-critical because in his capacity as Deputy Chief

ef a Division and. Chief of a Section, his duties. require hin

to act as head-of the Division during the Chief's absence, « -

to assist tm planning and directing the work of @nécpté£Bion and
directly to supervise and review the work of a Section.

13. As Deputy Chief of the Division he maintains secret contacts

-with, high officials of various Latin American governments for the

purpose of developing new sources of information. He assists the
Chief of the Division in over-all planning of research and
preparation of reports and. analyses concerning strategic factors
in the Latin. American sector. As Chief of the Report Section,
he directly supervises and reviews the work of the Section.

2. The Executive Committee desires

Library ‘employees who are working for OSS until

1. ‘ur. Howland would like from you or from
the Executive Comittee permission to hold up.Halperin's
transfer pending the completion of a full Civil Service
security check.

2.' This case 18 ono of. about 10 out of the

_ Library group in which thie same issue is raised, and

Nr, Howland would like the general principle ostablished
for the whole group, Mr. DuRant tells me that there
will be’no difficulty with tho Library if the transfer
of these individuals is dolayed. We will continue to
refmburse it for the salaries involved as horetofore.
There has been no cefinite agrnement to transfer the
Library group by April 1, merely a general understanding.

S$. The great majority of Library personnel
whose records have been quite clear, have alroady doen
transferred to our Civil Servico rolls on tho basis of
a apot check. . Since tho transfor of this personnel
has already deen nade, Ur. ilowland feols. that it would
be unwise to try to re-transfer them back to the
Library pending results of a full. check, and since his
office has approved their socurity before they wére
transferred I am inclined to agree.

tive Committee?

COORDINATOR OF INFORMATION

* INTEROFFICE MEMO

FROM: Preston E. Janes Gg Dave July 18, 1%2
To: Dr. William L. Langer

Supvect: Promotion of Maurice Halperin

This mediorandun i's to recommend the promotion of Maurice
Ealperin from: P-5 to P-6.~

Dr. Halperin entered on duty-in this office at the grade of
P-4 on October 2, 1941. His previous background in the Latin
American field includes a long-continued interest. in the problems
of Mexico, especially with reference to the program of land re-
distribution. He has made ten trips to kexico, spending a total
of two years in that country. He has written numerous reports
based on these field studies, the more important of which are:
Under the Lid in Mexico, (Current History, Nov. 19543; translated
and reprinted in Die Auslese, Berlin, Germany, December 1924;

Mexico--The Incredible (Current History, November 1936; translated
and reprinted in La Hora, Santiago, Chile, Noverber 23, 1936);

Khat About Mexico (ew Republic, January 12, 1938); Mocel Far:
in
Co;

exico (Current History, February 1938); Mexico's Sugar Bowl
‘to Lire (inter-American quarterly, January 1940); The Social
Background of Conte:porery Lexican [Itereture (Publications of

the xodern Languaye Associaticn of Anerica, September 1940); and ©
Kextco. Shifts Her Foreign Policy (Foreign Affairs, October 1940).

Dr. Halperin was put in charge of. the Mexico-Central America
subsection, and is the person .resporisible for several of the re-
ports on this. area. which were submitted by the Latin American
Section.. He has demonstrated his ability both to gather a reliable
factual base and to interpret these facts realistically. He is
also outstanding in his ability to render his reports in clear,

concise English.

On February 11,.19%2, Dr. Halperin was wace assistant chief
of the Latin American Section. During the past..months one of
thosmajor problems..of administration within the ‘section“has been
the separation of the workers from the section chief. It has
proved--imperative to maintain the headquarters of the section at

25th and E Streets where close contact is twintained with the head

offices. of the’agency and with the chief sources. of information.
However, spuce does not permit the housing of the research assis$-
ants st 25th and E Streets even if such en arrangecent were cesir-

ye Va ae

on

able. The actual work of preparing reports and surveys, there-
fore, must be carried on in the Library of Congress Annex. In
order to maintain clcese llaiscn between the section chief and

the staff, a conference is held at 25th and 5 Streets three
mornings each week at-which the zen in charge cf tine five regional
subsections are in.attendance. The renainder of the staff, how-
ever, remains permanently at the Annex.

a ‘Under these circumstences the assistant chief must assume &

' large measure of independent responsibility for the actual opera-

H tion of the section and for the Sersonnel problems. Dr. Halperin
has shown a ‘marked ability in this He has set up‘simple but |
effective machinery for the pert ‘ornance of the tasks assigned to
the section -and for the checking ef individual performance with
respect to these tasks. He has gained the respect and confidence
of the xenbers of the staff because of his fairness and honesty
in dealirg with ‘then,.but he has not failed to hold before then
a high standard of performance.

: Because of the large amount of individual responsibility
an which has been piaced on the assistant chief of this section, and
because the experience of nearly a year now demonstrates Dr.
Halperin's capacity to assume these _Tesponsibilities successfully,
I recomend his promotion to P-¢. :
