ADEX should be changed to include the new alias and

since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,

for the konterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested

that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue

Service that she may be receiving payroll checks under these

pseudonyms and not reporting her total income correctly. Appro-

priate investigation should be conducted to verify subject's

There is attached a

as a reference on his pul or application form.

From a reading of the

attached memorandum which was prepared by Section Chief G. C. Callan

of the Applicant section, it is obvious that the supervisors who handle

applicani matters in the Investigative Division do not have any policy

with respect to the interulewing of rejerences, Jormer employers,

associates of others except where the Bureau has specifically indicated

that certain individuals should not be contacted, such as Henry steele

commager, personnel of CBS and the like. As a matter of fact, the

present policy in effect at the seat of Government concerning applicant

investigations is to interview all references and the attached memorandum

indicates that Harold Iches had been interviewed in the past in connec

tion with applicant investigations and has exhibited a cooperative

with respect to the superuisory personnel at the seat of Government con

cerning the referral of Harold Ickes' name to the lashington Field

office for interview in connection with the stomic Energy Act case: ""

mentioned.

As you know, at the executives Conference the Director's wishes

with regard to interviewing persons who have demonstrated hostile .

attitudes toward the Bureau have been considered in the past ano no

instructions have been issued to the supervisors at the seat of Gover

ment or to the field concerning this matter except as to specific in-

dividuals

whose names have been sent to the field in the recent sast

in an SAC letter. This matter was called to the attention of the

Executives Conference as recently as December 20, 1949 and the Confer

ence felt it would be undesirable for the Bureau

to embark upon a pro-

gran of aduising the field to not intervie certain individuals in

connection with various types of investigations conducted by the Bureau.

The Executives Conference realized that the hostile attitule toward the

Bureau stèms not from our criminal investigative work but from the

Eureau's investigative activity in the jield of applicant

investigations

and

the Loyalty program. The Conference feels that the blacklisting

of individuals is fundamentally bod and will ultimately result in ei

treme embarrassment to the Bureau.

expecting them to adhere to any policy which will eliminate

the difficulty which we have encountered heretofore.

I have discussed this matter with dr. Carison in some detail

and he jeels that we may

' be able to control to some extent the inter

viewing of persons hostile to the iureau at the seat of Government

without furnishing a "block list" or statement of policy to the field.

Ir Carison feels, and I agree with hin, that the major portion of our

difficulty stems from the Loyalty investigations and applicant investi-

gations.

Ir. Carison and I therefore propose that the following pro-

cedure be instituted immediately ot the seat of Government in order to

neet the objectives desired by the director in connection with this

matter:

Io The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing

and maintaining in a current status a list of those individuals known

to be hostile to the bureau. It is felt that' it is imperative that a

list bé prepared. because the judgment of individual supervisors re-

serring cases to the field will differ depending upon the extent of

their day to day newspaper reading, radio listening and perusal of

various and sundry periodicals.

It would also mean that each superuisor

would have to either prepare his own list or endeavor to depend on a

faulty memory. Furthermore, an individual may at one time appear to be

hostile to the bureau and subsequently his attitude may change and it

may be very desirable to interview him.

2. This list shall be furnished to

only those supervisors at the.

seat of Government who have the responsibility for assigning Loyalty

or applicant cases to the field. This will include supervisors in the

Loyalty section of the security Division, the Applicant section of the

Investigative Division and those supervisors in the Administrative

Division handling Bureau applicant cases.

This will mean that not more

than 25 supervisors at most at the seat of Government will have pos

session of

such a list. These supervisors shall check all references

and present and former employers against this list bejore referring

the case to the field for investigation.

It should be realized that the procedure recommended will not

provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or

associates whose names are brought up during the course of the inves-

tigation.

It is felt, however,

that the bulk of the people who are

interviewed

in these

cases are

set out as references by the applicant

and it would only be on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the

Bureau will be interviewed on a neighborhood investigation or as an

associate of the applicant.

views with those individuals having a hostile or critical attitude

toward the Bureau and its work.

It was pointed out to the Conference that apparently the

hostility and criticism of the Bureau stem not from our normal day to

day criminal investigative work but to a very slight extent to inves

tigations in the Internal security field and very specifically and

definitely to applicant and Loyalty investigations.

It was feit that

if some procedure could be devised to auoid interviews with individuals

in applicant type cases where the individuals have exhibited a hostile

or critical attitude toward the bureau that much could be accomplished

to eliminate the difficulties experienced in the past. The conference

felt it would be undesirable to prepare a list of any sort which might

¡be termed a "blacklist" to be distributed to all of the divisional

offices.

It was proposed that the following procedure be instituted

immediately at the seat of Government in order to meet the objectives

desired by the director in connection with this matter:

I. The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing

and maintaining in o current status a list of those indiviquals, inown

because

the judgment of individual supervisors re

ferring cases to the field will differ depending upon the extent of

their day to day newspaper reading, radio listening and perusal of

various and sundry periodicals.

It would also mean that each supervisor

would have to either prepare his own list of endeavor to depena on a

Furthermore, an individual may at one time appear to be

Division handling sureau applicant cases.

This will mean that not more

than 25 superuisors at most at the seat of Government will have pos-

session of such a list. These supervisors sholl check all references

the case to the field for investigation.

It was pointed out that the procedure recommended will not

provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or subjects

under investigation in connection with the Loyalty Program nor would it

provide against interuiews of associates whose names are brought up

auring the course of the investigation. likewise it would not provide

against interuiews with college professors whose names were not given

by the applicant of the Loyalty subject as references, but who are

contacted. in the course of the ordinary investigation.

It was felt,

however, that the bulk of the people who are interviewed in these

cases are set out as rejerences by the applicant and it would only be

on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the Bureau would be inter.

viewed in a neighborhood investigation, as an associate or as a college

professor.

" It was also unanimously recommended by the Conference that in

addition to the preparation of the list recommended and the checking

at the seat of Government by the indicated superuisors, that where a

specific individual has manifested hostility of unjust criticism against

the Bureau that the specific field office or offices which would likely

contact the individual be advised in writing in the form of a Personal

and Confidential Sal letter. In these letters the SAC will be instructed

that it is his responsibility to aduise all of the Agents in the office

of the undesirability of contacting the individual in question without

prior Bureau authority.

The field will be instructed that in address-

ing their communications to the bureau requesting authority to contact

such individuals, the letter or communication should not contain the

phraseology that

the interview will be conducted unless aduised to the

contrary but specific approval must be obtained from the Bureau bejore

such a contact is made.

Should the Director agree with the recommendations of the

conference set Jorth in this memorandum, appropriate steps will be

taken to inaugurate the policy recommended.

Respectfully,

For the Conference

RE: COURTNEY A EVANS

PERSON NOT TO BE CONTACTED

On December 10, 1966, Senator Robert F. Kennedy released

to the press a copy of a letter to him dated February 17, 1966, from

former Assistier Director Courtney A. Evans. In direct contradiction

to official memc: anda prepared by Evans for Bureau files during the

early 1960's, his February 17, 1966, letter to Kennedy stated that

Evans! did not discuss the use of "microphones by the File with Kennedy

during his tenure as Attorney General--nor did Evans "know of any

written material that was sent to you" (Kennedy) "at any time concerning"

microphone surveillances.

In view of; Evans' obvious lack of integritv,

disregard for

the truth and duplicity toward the FBI, he should not be contacted

without prior Bureau approval.

DATE 10.2000

in line with the Director's approval, the Attorney General was

contacted this morning, July t, 1961, relative to his observation as to the

possibility of utilizing "electronic devices" in organized crime investigations.

It was pointed out to the Attorney General that we had taken action

with regard to the use of microphone surveillances in these cases and while

they represented an expensive investigative step, we were nevertheless utilizing

them in all instances where this was technically feasible and where valuable

information might be expected. The strong objections to the utilization of

telephone taps as contrasted to microphone surveillances was stressed. The

Attorney General stated he recognized the reasons why telephone taps should

be restricted to national defense type cases and he was pleased we had been

using microphone surveillances where these objections do not apply wherever

possible in organized crime matters.

The Attorney General noted that he had approved several technical

surveillances in connection with security-type investigations since he took

office, but that he had not kept any record and didn't really know what he had

approved and what surveillances were currently in operation. He said that for

his own information he would like to see a list of the technical surveillances

now in operation. He added that this could be brought over to him personally

and that he would look it over and immediately return it because he realized

the importance of having these records maintained under the special security

conditions which only the FBI had.

If the Director approves, we will have the list of technical

WASHINGION 25. D. C.

August 17, 1961

In connection with the use of microphone

surveillances it is frequendly necessary to lease a special telephone.

line in order to monitor such a surveillance.

These situations

occur when it is impossible to locate a secure monitoring point

in the irmediate vicinity of the premises covered by the microphone.

Even though a special telophone line is utilized, this activity in

no way involves any interception of telephonic communications and

is noi a ielephone tap.

In the New York City area the telephone company

has over the years insisted thai a letter be furnished to the telephone

company on eaci occasion when a special telephone line is leased by

the 231.

It is required that such a lease arrangement be with the

approval of the Attorney General. In the pest we have restricted

the utilization of leased lines in New Yor's City to situations involving

telephone taps, all of which have been approved by tiù ittorney General.

We have not previcusly used leased es in connection

with microphone surveillances because of certain technical carriculties

which exisied in New York City. These technical difficulties have,

however, now been overcome.

ii we are permitted to use leased telephone

lines as an adjunct to our microphone survalances, this type of coverage

can be materially extendeú both in securily and major criminal cases.

Accordingly, your approv?i of our utilizing this leased line arrangement

is requested. A sample oi the letter which it is proposed will be sent

to the telezone company it a leased line is secured in connection wit

microphone surveillances is attached.

on official business, gave rise to doubts as to the advisability

When a person was placed on the

Not To Contact list, the Field Office covering the residence

or occupation or both was advised that this particular individual

should not be contacted without prior Bureau authority. Thus,

the Not To Contact list did not prohibit future contact, but

specified it could be made only after clearance with the Bureau.

Examples of the type of individuals on this list

are sei lurii velur.

- DI. Vannevar

• Bush:

DI. Bush was placed on

the Not Io Contact list in June, 1964, at

which time he was connected with the Massachusetts

Institute of Technology.. He was so designated

when he made derogatory statements concerning the

Bureau when contacted on an applicant-type case.

Rex' Stout: Rex Stout is an author who was

designated for this list in 1965 because of his then-

new mystery novel, "The Doorbell Rang."

This novel

presented a highly distorted and most unfavorable

picture of the FBI in its operations as they relate

to the plot of the book.
