ADEX should be changed to include the new alias and

since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,
for the Monterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested
that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue

There is attached a memorandum dated December 20, 1949 fron
Ur. Rosen to Ur. Ladd with respect to the specific Atomte Energy case
mentioned, namely Fred Ernest Schnepfe, who had given Harold Ickes
as @ reference on his PSQ or application form. From a reading of the.
attachéd memorandum which was prepared by Sectton Chief G. C. Callan~
of the Applicant Section, tt ts ‘obvious that the Supervisors who handle
| applicant matters in the Investigative Division do not have any policy
| with respect to the interviewing of references, former employers,
associates or others except where the Bureau has specifically indicated
that certain individuals should not be contacted, such as Henry Steele
Commager, personnel of CBS and the like. As a matter of fact, the :
present policy in effect at the Seat of Government concerning applicant
investigations is to tnterview all references and the attached memorandum
indicates that Harold Ickes had been interviewed in the past in connec
tion with applicant investigations and has exhibited a cooperative ..
attitude. It would seem, therefore, that no action should be taken
with respect to the supervisory personnel at the Seat of Government con=
cerning the referral of Harold Ickes' name to the Washington Field :
Office for interview in connection with the Atomic Energy Act case:

As you know, at the Executives Conference the Director's wishés

instructions have been issued to the Supervisors at the Seat of Govern=

dividuals whose names have been sent to the field in the recent vast

Executives Conference as recently as December 20, 1949 and the Confer~
ence felt it would be undesirable for the Bureau to embark upon a prow
gran of advising the field to not interview certain ‘individuals in
connection with various types of investigations conducted by the Bureau.
The Brecutives Conference realized that the hostile attitude toward -the
Bureau stéms not srom our criminal investigative work but from the
Bureau's investigative activity tn the jield of applicant investigations.
and the Loyal3y Program. The Conference feels that’ the. blacklisting
of tndividuels is fundanentally bad and will ultimately result in er~
treme enbarrassment to the Bureau. Thpks, also felt it is extremely

lifficult to draft a letter to all SAC's pointing up the problem to
them and expecting them to adhere to any policy which wtl1l eliminate
the difficulty which we have encountered heretofore.

I have discussed this matter with Mr. Carlson in some detail
and he feels that we may be. able to control to some extent the inter=
viewing of persons hosttle to the iureau at the Seat of Government
without furnishing a "black list" or statement of policy to the field.
Ur. Carlson feels, and I agree with him, that the major portion of our
difficulty stems from the Loyalty investigations and applicant investi~
gations. Mr. Carlson and I therefore propose that the following pro=
cedure be instituted immediately at the Seat of Government in order to
neet the objectives desired by the Director tn‘connection with this

1. The Grime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing

may be very desirable to interview him.

The Brecutives Conference of January 4, 1950, corsist=(A8

ing of Messrs. Tolson, Glavin, Harbo, Ladd, Rosen, Clegg,

’ . Carlson, Wease and Mohr, in accordance with the Director's in-.
structions, considered the attached memorandum of Decembér 21},/7 ise
1949, with respect to the procedures in conducting applicant Mit Fp-.
tnvestigations and particularly the method suggested to srolademerty, ,
views with those individuals having a hostile or erttical attitude’

foward the Bureau and tts work.

It was pointed out to the Conference. that apparently the
hostility and criticism of the Bureau stem not from our normal day to
day criminal investigative | work but to a very slight extent to inves~
tigations in the Internal Security field and very specifically and
definitely to applicant and Loyalty investigations. It was felt that
.. tf some procedure could be devised to avoid interviews with individuals
<S) in applicant type cases where the individuals have exhibited a hostile
or critical attitude toward the Bureau. that much could be accomplished
to eliminate the difficulties experienced in the past. The Conference
ifelt it would be undesirable to prepare a List of any sort which might
|be termed a "blacklist" to be distributed to all of ‘the divistonal
offices. It was proposed that the following procedure be instituted
immediately at the Seat of Government in order to meet the objectives
desired by the Director in connection with this matter:

It was pointed out that the procedure recommended will not .
provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or subjécts
under investigation in connection with the Loyalty Program nor would it
provide against interviews of associates whose names are brought up
during the course of the investigation. Likewise it would not provide
against interviews. with college professors whose names were not given
by the applicant or the Loyalty subject as references, but who are
contacted, in the course of the ordinary investigation. It was felt,

" however, that the bulk of the people who are interviewed'in these
cases are set out as references by the applicant and it would only be
on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the Bureau would be inter~
viewed in a netghborhood investigation, as an associate or as a college
professor. 7 :

It was alse unanimously recommended .by the Conference that in
additton to the preparation of the list recommended and the checking
at the Seat of Government by the indicated Supervisors, that where a
specific individual has manifested hostility or unjust eriticism against
the Bureau that the specific fteld-office or offices which would likely
contact the tndividual be advised in writing in the form of a@ Personal
and Confidenttal S&C letter. In these letters the SAC will be instructed
that it is his responsibility to advise all of the Agents in the office
of the undestrability of contacting the individual in question without
prior Bureau authority. The field will be instructed that in address-
ing thetr communications to the Bureau requesting authority to contact
such individuals, the letter or communication should not contain the
phraseology that the interview will be conducted unless advised to the
contrary but specifie approval must be obtained from the Bureau before
such a contact ts made. :

Should the Director agree with the recommendations of the
Conference set forth in this memorandum, appropriate steps will be
taken to inaugurate the policy recommended.

In line with the Director's approval, the Attorney General was
contacted this morning, July 7, 1961, relative to his observation as to the
possibility of utilizing "electronic devices” in organized crime investigations.

, It was pointed out to the Attorney General that we had taken action
with regard to the use of microphone surveillances in these cases and while

they represented an expensive investigative step, we were nevertheless utilizing
| them in all instances where this was technically feasible and where valuable

information might be expected.

The strong objections to the utilization of

. telephone taps as contrasted to microphone surveillances was stressed. The
» Attorney General stated he recognized the reasons why telephone taps should

: ibe restricted to national-defense-type cases and he was pleased we had been mn
; se microphone surveillances where these objections do not apply wherever _+

{possible in organized crime matters.

; The Attorney General noted that he had approved several technical
surveillances in connection with security -type investigations since he took
office, but that he had not kept any record and didn't really know what he had
approved and what surveillances were currently in operation. He said that for

his own information he would like to see a list of the technical surveillances
He added that this could be brought over to him personally

In connection with the use of microphone
surveillances it is frequenily necessary io lease 2 special telephone -
. line in order io monitor such a surveillence. These situations
q . occur when it is impossible to locate a secure monitoring point
; in the immediate vicinity of the premises covered by the microphone.
Even though a special telephone line is utilized, this activity in
( no way involves any interception of telepnonic communications and
7 is not a telephone tap. -

In the New York City area the telephone company
‘. has over the years insisted thai a leiter be furnished-to the telephone
compony on each occasion when a special telephone line is leased by
the FSi, It is recuired that such alezse arrangement be with the
approval of the Attorney Genersl, In the past we have restricted

the utilization of leased lines in New Yorx City to situations involving
telephone taps, all of which have been approved by tuo +ttorney General.

We have not previously used leased 2.1es in connection
with microphone surveillances because of certain technical Loulties
which existed in New York City. These technical difficulties have,
however, now been overcome. if we are vermitted io use leased teleshon
lines as an adjunct to our microphone survetilances, this type of coverage
can be-materially extended both in security and major criminal cases.
Accordingly, your ayprov7i of our utilizing this leased line arrangerient
is requested. A sample oi the letter which it is proposed will be sent
to the telesnone company if a leased line is secured in comection wit

The Not To Contact list is a card index of 332 in-

dividuals whose statements or attitude, generally when contacted

on official business, gave rise to doubts as to the advisability

of contacting them again. When a person was placed on the

Not To Contact list, the Field Office covering the residence

or occupation or both was advised that this particular individual

should not be contacted without prior Bureau authority. Thus,

the Not To Contact list did not prohibit future contact, but

specified it could be made only after clearance with the Bureau.

~Dr. vannevéy ‘Bush: Dr. Bush was placed on

the Not To Contact list in June, 1964, at

designatéd for this list in 1965 because of his then-
new mystery novel, "The Doorbell Rang." This novel
presented a highly distorted and most unfavorable

M. A. Jones to Mr. Bishop Memo
RE: NOT TO CONTACT LIST

OBSERVATIONS :

It is not felt that the list continues to serve
a useful purpose, and it is further believed that the
responsibility of restricting contact with a person who is
antagonistic toward the FBI or law enforcement in general
should be that of the Agent in Charge. i

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1, -That the attached memorandum be forwarded
to all offices.

2. That if approved, the attached memorandum
be returned to the Crime Records Division for dissemination
to the field.

Acting Director, FBI -

NOT TO CONTACT LIST

As you know, in the past from,time to tine, =
various individuals have been placed on captioned list.
This action has been taken because of derogatory statements
or adverse action regarding the PBI or-law enforcement agencies
in general by the individuals involved.

This is to advise you that the Not To Contact
list is being discontinued, and you should use your
own best judgment if a question arises as to the desirability
of a particular contact in an investigative matter.
