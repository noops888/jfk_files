EXPANSION OF..FOREIGN LIAISON”
saanee

a

Please refer ‘to'the attached copy of a memorandum
\from Mr. Callahan to Mr. Mohr, dated 6/3/71, This memorandum
‘points out that the proposed expansion of foreign liaison
{would result in an approximate cost of $1,083,000. In regard
to this matter, I must take what will be an unpopular position;
one which runs counter to the present trend.

\ Frankly, I do not think that what we are getting from
our foreign liaison offices warrants such a tremendous
Jexpenatture. We must face up to the hard realities in this
matter, Specifically, I refer to the fact that, with the
{texception of one office, we are operating on strictly a liaison
basis in foreign countries. We are not operational; therefore
‘ithe kind of information we receive, in the main, cannot be
wconsidered high quality, firm, positive intelligence data.
This is the kind of data in which the President is interested.

I recognize fully that there will be some who will
disagree with me, but as I follow and understand our foreign
liaison operations the more convinced I am that what we «
receive falls into four main categories, i.e., &
(1) there is information given to us which is in the nature
of gossip;

(2) we receive opinions of native contacts in the countries
jwhere we are, or in Some instances people in. those countrie
from other nations; RECA, bus
{ (3) we receive what might be called "planted" ‘information, ,
texpressly material which our native contacts give to us which
, they want conveyed via the FBI to -the White House or other
‘pertinent high-ranking U.S. officials----information tha't
\would serve the interests of their own countries; and

} (4) lastly, we do from time to time develop information that,
at least to us, appears to be of value, but this is not in

,sufficient quantity to justify the expense of our operations.
,The same can be said of data relating to our criminal

Mr. Tolson SECRET

as It is a matter of, common sense to conclude that
ire cannot develop hard, high quality, positive intelligence
by sending men to these countries only in a liaison capacity.
pat beet would have to be operational, with penetration of
‘icommunications and the development of covert sources in
«sensitive areas. It would take years to actually develop
operationally in foreign countries to the point where the
ia can be considered to be in depth and of great value.

It has been recommended, among other things, that we
reopen our office in Brazil, Some years ago I strongly recom-
mended closing that office because it was clearly unproductive.
There is no reason to believe now that it would be any more so.

I the same is true of other offices.

It seems to me that the time has arrived to take a
very honest, cold, impartial look at our foreign liaison
operations. We should ask ourselves the question, "Would any

{| real harm be done this nation if. we did not expand and i a
i Humber of our ¢ nt “Tiaison yf fices were closed, with” the
/' i money “Saved thereby being put to Something inoré Worthwhile

and the manpower applied to our heavy domestic responsibilities?"

‘+ ESTIMATED COST OF PROPOSED cer
EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON aa

i The Director noted on the attached memorandum from Mr. W. R.
Wannall to Mr. C. D. Brennan dated 5/28/71: "What is estimated cost of this
if approved?H."- |

“+ The proposed expansion would require the assignment of an
additional 29 employees (15 agents and 14 clerks) to Foreign Liaison. It is
anticipated that we will not ask for additional employees but we expect to take
the number from the 851 employees (500 Agents and 351 clerks) in our fiscal year __
1972 request which begins on 7/1/71. The 29 employees if put on foreign assignment
will cost the Bureau approxina tely $100,000 additional. We have not provided for i
such funds and if the project is undertaken, the funds will have to come from some _
other source in our budget such as equipment. If we keep taking money from our
equipment item we will soon be operating with obsolete equipment. :

: The total cost of foreign liaison operations would be increased
by approximately $1,083,000 on an annual basis broken down as follows: :

(1) expansion of existing ‘offices--$313, 680; (2) reopening of former offices=~ :
$315, 502; and (3) iti of three new offices $453,818, ys

This memorandum, with a11 ticklers attached (including
my own), is being sent directly. to you. I am doing this in
order to prevent any gossip that might circulate around the
Bureau had I taken the ticklers off and routed them, This will
give you an opportunity to consider the entire matter and decide
at what time you want to release the tickler copies.

As you know, this memorandum is predicated on your state-
ment, written on Mr. Felt's memorandum of 6/10/71 to Mr. Tolson,
which reads; ‘I would like to have from Sullivan a list of
foreign offices he would recommend be closed now."

This complex subject matter will be handled in three
stages: First, I will discuss the offices to be closed now, or
within the foreseeable future. These relate to the long-established
foreign liaison offices, Second, I will discuss the liaison
offices which were opened during the latter part of 1970.

Third, I will make reference to the proposed expansion of foreign |
Tiaison and the proposed opening of additional foreign offices.

FIRST STAGE
MADRID, SPAIN -

pease SE cs
I recommend the closing of this office now. It was re-
opened in June, 1969, Sincé that tiie thé operational cost

has been $152,952, The Legal Attache's salary is Grade 15, $25,867.
The Legal Attache is Mr. V. V. Kolombatovic, whom I regard as an
outstanding man, However, the work is simply not there and I
question strongly that what we have received is worth the cost

of operating this office.

I believe consideration should be given to transferring
Mr. Kolombatovic to head the office in Copenhagen, where the
Legal Attache is being recalled because of a security violation.

Memorandum to

The Director
Re: FBI, Foreign Liaison Program

I realize that Mr. R. E. Potocki, Assistant Legal Attache’ in

Paris, has been recommended %o be the Legal Attache in Copenhagen;
however, if this is cancelled it would mean moving only Kolombatovic
to Copenhagen, leaving Potocki where he is, thereby keeping expenses
down.

(I am aware that Ambassador Hill asked to have an FBI man
assist hin; that Mr. Hill is a personal friend of President Nixon; and
that it is said he intends to retire soon, If the Bureau wishes to
base its decision on this I have no further comment to’ make relative
to this office.)

HONG KONG -

This office was opened in April, 1966, and since then it
has cost the Bureau $331,453. Again, I do not think we have in any.
way received value from the office which would even approximate

| remotely the cost of this operation. On the other hand, I recognize
| that Hong Kong is a sensitive area from the standpoint of Chinese
| intenligence operations, Therefore, I recommend that either the
present Legal Attache, Dan Grove, be returned to this country for
j obviously failing to make the office productive and a new Legat be
put in his place, or the Hong Kong Office be closed now. Mr. Grove
is in Grade 16, with salary of $29,067.

BERN, SWITZERLAND -
——~---—"THIg oftice was opened in October, 1961, and since then
it has cost $457,085, Again, I fail to see that the product coming
out of this office during the past ten years has in any way equaled
the large expense involved, In view of the fact that the Paris

\ Office can cover the situation at Bern, Switzerland, I'think the

: unnecessary work in the Bern Officé can be eliminated and this

area should be covered by Paris, I recommend thé closing of the

VIEWS OF MESSRS,
BEAVER, DALBEY AND FELT -

I have read the comments of the above-named men, It
was somewhat more than mildly distressing and saddening to me
to observe the lack of objectivity, originality, and independent
thinking in their remarks, The uniformity and monolithic
character of their thinking constitutes its own rebuttal. While
I am certain it was not the intention of these important Bureau
officials, who occupy unique roles, to create the impression
in the reader's mind that they said what they did because they
thought this was what the Director wanted them to say, neverthe-
less it seems to me this is the impression conveyed.

It has been my experience that the Director certainly
does not want officials of the Bureau to try to guess what he
would approve of, but rather wants men to think a subject-matter
through and give their views, calling "a spade a spade," and
“letting the chips fall where they may." The Director is fully
capable of deciding for himself among conflicting viewpoints.

To use any other approach is, I think, to render a disservice
to the Bureau,

This current situation reminds me that a number of years
ago it was pointed out that Inservice training, as it then

existed, was of very little, if any, value to our field agents,
All the agents in the field knew this. However, when it was

Memorandum to :
The Director
Re: FBI Foreign Liaison Program ,

[called to the Director's attention a number of Bureau officials
\went to great lengths to insist that there was nothing wrong
‘with Inservice and that it*‘should remain as it existed at the
time. Change was opposed. The Director will recall the results
f£ this controversy, for there was plenty wrong with Inservice.
{[t had to be overhauled, and it was at the Director's instructions.

I am also reminded of a statement attributed to Tom Huxley
which, though uttered years ago, fits the present subject-matter
with rare exactitude. Huxley said that, when faced with a
difficult problem, one should give up all pre-conceived beliefs,
notions, prejudices and desires to please, and sit down with
an open mind before the evidence, and follow wherever it leads,
for otherwise no worthwhile contribution can be made.

I do wish, however, to point out that I think Mr. Felt
made a useful contribution and a most valid observation when he
commented favorably on the Mexico City Office (and I share his
view), and concluded, "However, Mexico City is an operational
office, whereas the others are not, and in my opinion this goes
to the crux of the matter." Of course it does, and we should
not lose sight of this major and decisive fact, or inundate it
with irrelevant words.

SUMMATION

To sum up, since the offices to which I have alluded

(in the first stage of this memorandum) were opened, we have
spent a total of $2,256,715, as of 6/15/71. It seems to me,
from the standpoint of efficient administration, this money
can be far better spent in the domestic field, where’ our primary

} responsibilities are and where our problems are increasing and
becoming ever more complex, I am sure none of us are wholly
satisfied with the way we are discharging our operational

| responsibilities in all areas of the domestic field. Further,
we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that our Legal
Attache poSitions are not the "plums" of the Bureau. They
carry fine salaries, plus living allowances, opportunities
for foreign travel, et cetera. These positions do not even

complex responsibilities which our field office administrators
shoulder day in and day out. The Legats know this better, it
seems than some of us here at the Bureau. How many Legats
have asked to.return to the field down through the years? And
when a foreign office is opened we are flooded with requests to
go. The “word" has certainly gotten around, The "plums" are
well identified. vs

Additionally, the evidence points to the fact that,
because of racial conflict, student and academic revolution,
and possible ticrease in unemployment; this country is Kéading
into ever more troubled waters, and the Bureau had better be
fully prepared to cope with the difficulties which lie ahead.
This cannot be done if we spread ourselves too thin and finance
operations which do not give us proper returns for the dollars
spent. We all know that the taxpayers of this country fully
expect that the Bureau will give them the best possible return
for their tax dollar, This is a truth which I think is most

{relevant to some of our foreign operations, and it is a truth
which we ought not to ignore.

1so, we must be very careful not to mislead the President into
‘thinking we can consistently develop for him, in volume and

Lastly, I am not unmindful of the fact that the Director
pointed out that we could get along quite well without an
expansive domestic liaison section and, therefore, he dissolved
it. Applying the Director's reasoning to foreign liaison, I
think certainly the conclusion is valid that we can at least
reduce it, with benefits to the Bureau.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

eo y AN ee / Water t&
Pursuant to the. Director's ‘request, we have considered

various steps which.could be ‘taken to expand our coverage abroad
in order to augment our development of high-level intelligence of
interest to the White House. There are areas of the world where
political and other developments would be of keen intelligence
interest and we have included some of these although we cannot
expect that any substantial volume of data pertinent to the
Bureau's domestic jurisdiction will be developed. Thus, assignment
of Agents to such areas would be almost exclusively for the
purpose of developing intelligence. We have also prepared an
outline of our present coverage involving 42 Agents and 47 clerks
assigned to 17 foreign offices. This outline reflects the changes
which were made during the expansion effected in December, 1970,
and is attached.

We believe that our coverage can be stepped up in our
j existing offices by increasing the complements of our Madrid,
lpeirut, Tokyo, London, and Caracas Offices. In addition, offices
| forneriy operating in Rio de Janeiro, | Santo Santo Domingo, and Manila
gould be reopened, | "thereby relieviig pressure on Buenos | Aires;
| gee Juan, and Hong Kong, which are presently attempting coverage
on @ roadtrip basis, _New offices could be opened in Australia,
Southeast Asia, India, and in the Benelux area. The office in
India, ‘presumably ‘at New Delhi, would open an entirely new area
and give:. us access to information of U. S. interest concerning
India, Pakistan, and Burma. The office in Australia and in
Southeast Asia would also relieve our office at Hong Kong which
presently travels to these areas and would permit intensification
of coverage in Hong Kong itself by the two Agents currently
assigned, The additions contemplated above would — involve an
Agents plus an appropriate ™ "S1é Leal
J ecific recommendations concerning the’ most
pro! uctive locations in some of the areas considered, we believe we
should secure the advice of some of our experienced men abroad who
have worked in the areas and are intimately familiar with their

Legats by teletype on a highly confidential basis.

MOCASE (THE BORIS NORNOS CASE) re

Item number one in the material-submitted to ‘the

Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum
3/5/70 discusses the case of Boris Hoxxh6- (Mocase).

BACKGROUND OF CASE Boris Morros,“a Hollywood motion picture
producer, was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935, | From
1947 to 1957 he was operated as a double agent by: the FBI, This
was an extremely senSitive counterintelligence operation involving
Soviet intelligence activities in the United States in which
Morros traveled behind the Iron Curtain for meetings with his

| Soviet principals,

Information obtained by Morros from his Soviet contacts
_was disseminated to interested agencies, including the Central
| Intelligence Agency, On January 25, 1957, Jack Soble, Myra Soble,
and Jacob Albam were arrested in New York on charges of conspiracy
| to commit espionage against the United §tates,

PROBLEM WITH } On March 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated
information received from Boris Nor: OS 2
intelligence agencies

criticized the: information and, in effect, characterized it as
x the product of a paper mill," which conclusion
had been applied to many similar disseminations in
the past from apparently e same source, By letter of April 5,
1954, the Bureau informed that it was believed that no useful
urpose would be served in making any future dissemination to
(Cp information received from this source.

On April 9, 1954,
[advised Liaison Agent Papich that he had been looking into the
matter and there was ho question in his mind but that his agency
had acted stupidly in transmitting such a letter to the Bureau,

from the source in the future.

Nevertheless, memorandum AME to AMA dated

April 28, 1954, pointed out that when and if the Bureau receives
- information in the Mocase in the future of a type required

by National Security Council Directixeto be furnished to CIA,

it should be carefully evaluated and a, decision made at that time
as to the officials and agencies of the’Government to whom it
should be disseminated "OK but before anything
goes to This
restriction does not apply to dissemination to other agencies. H"

Subsequent to the foregoing three disseminations were
made to interested agencies, ee on information
from Morros during October and December, 1954, and appropriate
dissemination was made thereafter with the Director's approval,

As the time grew near for prosecutive action, the
Department requested the Bureau to check with CIA to see if
Department attorneys could

On June 13, 1957, Abel was located by Bureau Agents when

concurrence, we arranged for INS authorities to arrest Abel on
June 21, 1957, on an alien warrant, After Abel's arrest, the
Department continued to raise questions concerning KAMAE
willingness to testify in an espionage prosecution against Abel
and requested the Burea: to press WAMBE in that regard, We
took the position that any efforts to induce WAHE t to testity

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION; ..
This question first arose when a Dutch official approachec

our representatives at the NATO-’Special Committee conference in
Paris in May, 1956, and requested Bureau assistance in interviewing
MAME ‘in the U. S, and to have a Dutch representative

present during the interview. VAME is the widow of MAME
. MAME “ , whé operated an espionage network in Europe prior

to his defection in YE&Af The Dutch representative said CIA had

interviewed her, but the results were unsatisfactory. He was told

to submit his request through diplomatic channels

RM d two others in the U. S., but not to participate in
interview, In accordance with instructions, SA Papich told
to have the Dutch submit their request through diplomatic

Channels and to include all information in writing, .and that the
Bureau would not deal personally with a Dutch representative. By
memorandum of June 15, 1956, it was reported that MAME :
off__told SA Papich he was of the very strong opinion that the
Bureau's position made good sense, but Sther| ~~ Jofficials felt the
Dutch should be helped in every possible way.

MAME pointed out the Bureau's position was very
simple in that the Dutch had been caught short in the MAHE
case when their représentatives-had been obtaining highly
classified information from a friendly tovernment ani, before
the FBI even requested to interview the, Dutch representatives
involved, the WAME notified State Department
that if Dutch representatives were to be interviewed, it should
“be done by State Department and not by the FBI. WAME was
_ told that in view of this, the Bureau notified State Department
" that ‘any requests for information from the Dutch to be handled

‘ oS :

The observations of Special Agent Papich in ths
matter are broad and general in nature. ‘His presentation is
hinged upon the premise advanced by the Agency that "internal
security" cannot be separated from "counterintelligence,"
thereby necessitating our advising CIA of requests to our
Legats to have leads covered in foreign countries. The Manual
of Instructions, Section 102, page 23, states CIA's responsibilities
include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and
dissemination of intelligence information. CIA does not have,
among other things, responsibility for “internal security
functions," poe :

In the absence of unusual situations,, we forward
investigative.leads pertaining to our cases in countries where
we have liaison coverage to the particular Legal Attache
concerned, Through his contacts the Legat arranges for tt
necessary investigation and submits the desired information
according to our reporting needs, The Legat coordinates
this activity on a local level. .

It is more desirable to have our representatives
request investigation abroad in order to achieve’ maximum coverage,

Legat Office in Havana and did not ‘coordirfate our operations
with CIA or advise it we had sources there, It was noted that
after Castro came on the scene, approval was granted to turn
certain informants over to CIA, Papich also refers to a
memorandum WH#ME to WANE » 2/5/60, regarding the
Communist Party of Cuba (CPC) which dealt with the problem
of whether a Havana source used in an intercept operation
between the Communist Party of Venezuela and the CPC should be
turned over to CIA to obtain complete coverage. We, of course,
had no coverage of Venezuela, Bureau had not advised other
agencies of this source since we did not want Castro to uncover
any eperational activities which might embarrass the Bureau,
The ontire operation was later turned over to CIA.

CIA began its operations in Havana in 4/47 and ina
letter to the Bureau, 4/28/53, regarding Havana informants,
WAME noted that CIA was not overly cooperative and that,

i in fact, it was not developing pertinent information, At that
time “va@rve met with the CIA representative in Havana who
admitted he was not getting any information concerning the CPC

., gend had no plans for any aggressive action in that field. For
this reason it was necessary for us to develop our own coverage.
We instructed snyge to ascertain from the Havana CIA
representative information available to him concerning matters
of interest to the Bureau; however, he was to continue through
informant sources to obtain needed information regarding security
matters which could not be supplied by CIA. Subsequently, our
relations with CIA improved to the point of being described as
excellent in 1958, We think our overall position to-be sound,

Director added that no more time should be wasted on it, at
least until CIA restrictions were removed, We continued
to attempt to get the restrictions removed without success and
covered outstanding leads,

In September, 1964, an analysis of the case disclosed
that although thirty-eight separate investigations were opened
only three PorEGwv agents were uncovered, Original allegations
of FoREIG/ intent to mount an espionage mission in the United States
could not be substantiated,- This information, coupled with the
fact that CIA refused to make MAME available to us-for
the purpose of resolving discrepancies, prompted a decision
transmitted -by us to CIA on 9/30/64 that we were closing our
investigation in this case.

Mr. Papich commented in his memorandum of 3/5/70
CIA never has been satisfied with the efforts made by the
Bureau in this case. Our review indicates our efforts in the
matter were as full and complete as possible under circumstances
where CIA refused to grant us access to the source, did not
respond to request for clarifying data and declined to remove
restrictions making it impossible to take necessary investigative
steps. Should aay question be raised in the future, we are in
a position to document our iectasetaauah iene isisdiniiahtilihai with a

Item Number 19 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
the posSible travel of one of our Mexican border informants
to Cuba and whether our not advising CIA of this made us
potentially vulnerable to charges we were operating outside
“the U.S. without coordinating with CIA,
7 BACKGROUND:
EEE This involved our plans to send ~

Cuba. The trip never materialized.

In October, 1965, we were vitally interested in
determining the location and extent of Cuban guerrilla training
sites being used to prepare Latin American subversives to carry
out revolutions in their home countries. . VAM& , a Mexican
-national residing in PsAc& , Mexico, which is within the area
covered by G00E VAME » had infiltrated Fopéievand Fopeiu
intelligence operations in Mexico City and had made himself
attractive to Mexican communist leaders who were planning to
pay expenses of sending guerrilla trainees to Cuba.

: CIA CONSIDERATIONS:

_NAME was an integral part of ““@ebe aca
VAuE 7 which is handled on a need-to-know basis. We
had previously obtained material from CIA showing its primary

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHEP WITH CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)
DISSEMINATION OF CIA INFORMATION
IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his
memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph
dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."
Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of the
document Bureau did not obtain CIA clearance to include CIA
information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested
agencies, including CIA. According to SA Papich, CIA never
made any protest although it considered our action a violation
of the "third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did
contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data
obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data
was biographical in nature and was used: in the monograph to
characterize the past, including communist contacts, of key
figures in the Dominican Republic. It was taken from the 1963
CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA telegrams dating back to 1961,
all of ‘which were previously disseminated to the U. S, intelligence
community by CIA. Nosattempt was made in the monograph to
characterize CIA data as Bureau information and, in fact, this

_ information was attributed to "another Government agency," in
accordance with established procedures, :

: The so-called "third agency rule" provides that

. Classified information originating in a department or agency
Will not be disseminated outside the receiving agency without
the permission of the originating agency, However, an exception
to this rule provides that the receiving agency may- disseminate
such data to other members of the U, S. Intelligence Board (USIB),
of which Bureau is a' member, unless the originating agency
uses appropriate control markings limiting its data to the
use of the receiving agency only. The CIA data used in the
Bureau monograph had no such control markings and. our monograph
was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and
USIB members only.

The Bureau's monograph was a compendium of our own

on the understanding and handling by the intelligence community
of a serious crisis which confronted this country.

Item Number 21 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
Bureau operation of informants in -P4ACE and comments on
our potential vulnerability for not having informed CIA at
the inception of the operation of these informants.

SA Papich has cited two situations. The first

concerns . MAME oo, an attorney
residing in PLACE ~ our Legat, PLACE » in the Fall
of 1996, identified NAME as a potential source of intclligonc

information of importance to U.S. security; conducted
appropriate background inquiry regarding him and determined

his excellent potential and willingness to furnish intelligence
information to U.S. Government. By memorandum 11/23/66 it was
approved that we contact CIA ‘headquarters through liaison
_..channels to inform CIA that we planned to maintain contact with
CANE ; that CIA would be furnished the information obtained
-and that we would service CIA requests provided they could be
handled with complete security. SA Papich so informed

MAME of CIA on 11/25/66. -WAME -c/A stated he saw no reason
why FBI could not proceed as we desired and that CIA headquarters
would so inform its representatives in /.aceé and Place ,
instructing them to give FBI all necessary support in-this
“operation. Since that date we have operated WAyset .as a
valuable and productive unpaid confidential source. Since this
matter was coordinated with CIA at the outset, there appears to

- be no Pros en 7 t

“The second situation cited by SA Papich concerned
Legat, Pace , informant “44°, This individual has cooperated
with the Bureau for some 25 years. As a LACE police

Upon MAME *s designation as a highly placed police
official in Pr»AAce in 1967, we promptly advised CIA
headquarters through liaison channels of informant's identity.

_ We advised CIA that we had utilized wAAé for handling
criminal leads and that he periodically volunteered information
concerning political developments in Peace +. At that time,
10/6/67, it was agreed that Bureau would continue control of
informant and that after each contact with informant by our
road trip Agent, the latter would confer with NAAE
Head of CIA operations in PeAcE (who was present at CIA
headquarters at the meeting) concerning political information
furnished by the intormant. We were assured’ of complete CIA
cooperation in this matter, On the occasion of our read trip
Agent's next contact with MAME in PLAGE , however, VANE-O4
bitterly accused our Agent of having lied to him and of having
operated a source in AcE | without CIA's knowledge. He
‘stated that responsibility for the development of security

HARASSMENT OF CIA

Item #23 in the material submitted to the Director by
SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses a letter
dated November 15, 1967, from CIA which requested that the Bureau
check telephone toll calls from the home of one BME
who waS allegedly harassing CIA WVAME. Was
supposedly seeking information concerning CIA's covert operations.
SA Papich states that we told CIA that we would not check the toll
calls on the basis that the information received was not sufficient
to justify investigation within the Bureau's jurisdiction. SA Papich
: also states that "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt
i that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of
refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the
security of U.S. intelligence operations.”

A review of Bureau files disclosed that a memorandum,
VAME » to VANE * dated November 17, 1967,
was prepared. This memorandum encompassed the above facts and
recommended that CIA Liaison Agent advise CIA that we would not |
\ . Check the toll calls as requested. This memorandum and recommendatio:

In addition to the above, on December 9, 1967, WAME

about CIA and offered to make the material available to the Miami
Office. Our Miami Office was advised that this information was of

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sam

Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations
Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,

CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to
-assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by
providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist
Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.
His memorandum added that we told that agency the FBI had no
informants available because they were necessary for our own
operations. He claims we took the position since we saw no

on the continent of Africa and that his agency. found it most
difficult to establish effective penetration, MAME noted that

move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable
him to develop worthwhile sources. He asked if the Bureau would
consider furnishing one of its Negro informants or developing an

Africa. Papich told /“aHé that if the Bureau had a good Negro

informants were necessary for our own operations, particularly
in the communist field, and it recommended and was approved
that CIA be-orally informed that it is not possible to provide

source of the information set forth in our letter. The last
paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the
impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that
CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles
concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter
also stated as follows:

, “It is significant that information in the indi-
vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your
arrival in a particular country. Therefore, there is a
question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist
organizations which would -have led to the development of
information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of
your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding
instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958.
The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director
had a discussion with Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as
the first sentence of the above letter-reads as follows:

“Apropos of our discussion today, there is sey
forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency
reports received from them on May 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to
Mr. Nixon “is contained in a memorandum WA ME to

There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-
tion which was summarized in our letter to Mr. Nixon, and we
clearly indicated in our letter‘that the source was CIA. With
regard to any question being raised as to the quality of
CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to
Mr, Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader
of the CIA reports - - that is, that the information from CIA
popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and
Mr, Nixon's arrival. Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he
was personally involved in demonstrations directed against
him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that
advance information from our responsible intelligence agency
(CIA) may have been jacking.

3/5/70 discusses WAME an individual who was operated
as a criminal informant by the Bureau who furnished valuable
information and who has been a key witness in the prosecution

the Bureau acquired access to “AME through the CIA and that

extremely valuable.

Memorandum dated 2/20/63 from WAuS to

MAME source was confident that the lawyer could be developed

The Attorney General agreed with the CIA representatives that the

MAME "set up the first contact! with the individual

The Bureau's success in handling LAME can be
attributed to the know-how of the SAs of the New York
Office because#AHA is a highly emotional individual
and he had aggravated marital problems, severe pressures
from his many business associates; therefore, it took
a high degree of skill in dealing with this source in
order to achieve the success that we did.

While it is acknowledged that CIA put us
originally in touch with this source, it was not
believed that it is essential that we go back to’ CIA
and explain to them our success or to thank them for.
giving us this original léad. It is also noted that
there is an obligation upon Government agencies to
cooperate in the fullest and CIA's cooperation in this
matter was in accordance with the long standing policy
among all Government agencies,

Review of WAME _ file does not reflect any
instance where CIA indicated a displeasure in the Bureau

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the
Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70
discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief
that Buréau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance
in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.
Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich
to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy
of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that
more aggressive action should have been taken in field of
collecting positive intelligence in the United States. Papich
notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been
restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when
political crises occur in some céuntry. He points out CA belief
that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-
lance coverage, development of informants and collection of
eryptographic material. Papich cites two specific cases occurring
in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage
suggesting to Agency that it make its request diréctly to the
Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned sét forth
with Director's comments relative thereto being noted. Our
policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

Memorandum to Mr.?U, D.: DeLoach

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH . ;
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY i 7
DETAILS: i a ;

7 Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive
order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of
such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and
that facets of these investigations of violations of United States
laws serve to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred
to by us as investigations of internal security matters. Papich

- notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

_field has been restricted to the compliance with requests by
State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring
in some foreign country.

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of
vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development
and collection of cryptographic material. According to Papich,
CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area
and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the
problem. Papich cites two cases MAME . and
i MAME 7 where CIA requests for technical surveil-~
lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these
“matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the
Attorney General, <

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH 7
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE eecaicad 7

Our investigation s showed close contact by Pane with FoPe/ty
efficials, AME. and details
of activity by a subject to create ‘the firm mentioned.

MAME headed a P4LACH _ firm involved in Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC) work requiring "Top Secret" clearance by “AEC.
Our initial’ investigation was closed when Assistant Attorney
General - Internal_Security Division found that facts did not
justify soliciting “AMé__'s registration as a foreign agent.

In'Spring of YA sixty-one kilograms of nuclear
material were found to be unaccounted for by the firm headed
by MAKE but subsequent inventories and checking by AEC
revealed this shortage was probably the result of cumulative
process of wasteful production methods over a period of eight
years and‘did not justify an unqualified determination of a
diversion of nuclear material on the part of WANE to
unauthorized persons or government,

CIA, in YeAft became alarmed on receipt of information
of loss of mentioned nuclear material and despite AEC findings
felt it may indicate illegal diversion or at least justificatiscn
for reopening investigation. NANE o CIA contacted
the Attorney General directly with his thoughts regarding the
need for additional investigation. Attorney General contacted
Bureau requesting it discuss matter with CIA and determine
advisibility of additional investigation. The Director, in
approving conference with CIA, noted "OK but I doubt advisibility
of getting into this. It looks, like MAME is going around
us to AG as he suspects we woulda say no."

An intensive investigation of WAM& conducted
during late YEAA and into Fall of ygaR revealed no positive
intelligence activity on his part or verifiable diversion of
AEC material to Fofgi¢v Our investigation included technical
surveillances installed HbA7E and discontinued, PATH, MAME
was interviewed by AEC b47r& and disclaimed passing any
classified data to Fof&E/éiv Facts of case were
reviewed by Department of Justice which found no evidence of pro-
secutable violation by MAME AEC felt the additional investi-
gation produced no data upon which could be based a legitimate
withdrawal of clearance for AEC contracts or information. In
view of this, we closed our investigation and CIA was so advised.

would produce no legal evidence pertinent to the issue which
prompted CIA's original request but noted he felt reinstituted
audio surveillances of AME would produce positive intelligence
information. He therefore requested reinstitution of this
coverage. ‘The Director's letter to WAKE .. noted that
after careful review it was felt that CIA should take this

matter to the Attorney General,

On October 21, 1969, a CIA official was told by
Special Agent Papich that inthe future CIA should transmit its
requests for technical surveillance coverage in the United States
to the Attorney General. This specifically covered the cases
of AME and WAHE- The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,
changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate
international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the
Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA
regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United States.
On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with
CIA, the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our
guard down as CIA has always outsmarted’us because of our
gullibility." .

: ¢

. SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the
field and Bureau offigials results of the conferences with CIA
and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction.in
the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)
emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement
upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to
cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the
United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director
noted "I hope there is. no 'sneaker' in this. Tie will tell."

There has been no renewed request from CIA for
technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there
been any indication that such requests have been sent by CIA
to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest
in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility
the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired
coverage at some time in the future. :

. of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to
"bring about the necessary coverage. A good example is our involvement
in the development of information relating to the crisis in the Dominicana
Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be “gray areas"
of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to
effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the.development of positive intelligence in this
country is vast and varied. Voluminous poSitive intelligence is collected
overtly through the review of foreign and ciomestic publications, interviews
of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this
area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

*

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive
intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity for a
clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is
this true in the development of poSitive intelligence sources who are
| employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States
| or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years the Bureau has had a continuing pr
developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of di
our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for develovi
positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in
formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA s need for sources in the
positive intelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources
the United States in a limited manner with the understanding that such activit
are fully coordinated with the Bureau.

and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished
the necessary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA
resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established
‘in January, 1984. i Pi
JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA
as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be décided at the
Seat of Government. As ¢ general rule, Bureau Headquarters will be canara
by C14 regarding ils interest in an individual or a target. Prior to notification
of CIA regarding our position, the situation will be carefully reviewed at the
Seat of Government. This may often include a request to the field for

observations and recommendations before notice is transmitted to CIA, At
the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a
representative of DOD, CIA. If so, you should be guided by the enclosed
ground rvles in any discussions, ‘bearing in mind that the approval for any
particular cperational activity is to be made-at Bureau Headquarters.

You should hold to the concept that the protection of the internal
security of the United States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities
of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts
which you may have with CIA representatives. ‘There is to be no interferezce
with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unforesee
developments may create siiuations not adequately covered by the ground r-ies.
You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth
complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been informed
by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be
interfered with, we cannct discount the results of past experiences stem
from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reasc7
. believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. It is.
therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown of 2:
adherence to the ground rules. I emphasize that this is an area of activi
which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge. You
should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Berzau
can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this
entire matter. .

Item Number 38 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in hismemorandum of 3/5/70 serves as

@ sort of summary in which SA Papich indicates that he cannot

recall the names of other cases which resulted in CIA displeasure

or criticism, but does cite one instances "early in the 1950's"

in which we disseminated data from a source of unknown reliability

charging Allen Dulles as having been a communist and a spy

while in Europe.

By letter 3/22/52, we informed State and CIA that a
source of unknown reliability had alleged that /P&éV7T)FS/vG@
a BAYA had been arrested in Hungary in 1947 or
1948 and forced to write a letter to his wife which brought her
to Hungary where she was also arrested. We asked for an
evaluation of the information. WAKE memorandum,
4/5/52, states he received a call from Allen Dulles during which
Dulles referred to the letter and said’he was not concerned
about it but wanted ¥AMSto look it over. We were subsequently
informed by CIA that Allen Dulles | Ip&wriFleMG Dara” ow
OTHER MVdIVrDVa Re : sBaueee had said that
the information concerning Dulles and his wife was without
foundation and we promptly told State of this by letter 4/15/52,
@ copy of which was directed to Allen Dulles. WAGE
: +. memorandum 5/10/52 written by SA Papich reports his discussion

i original letter could be withdrawn and was told that it appeared
unas that the FBI had already set the records straight but that if he
wished to make an official request, Papich would refer the matter
to the Bureau for consideration. Dulles. immediately replied that
he definitely did not want to make "a big thing" of the letter,
that it was not that important, and that maybe it would be better
to drop the matter.. General Smith (then Director of Central

Intelligence) later told Papich that he considered the matter
closed,

SA Papich also alludes to other instances in which
oo. [CIA alleged that we had mishandled its information. He has no

(HERBERT HOOVER COMMISSION - 1954)

Item number nine in the material ‘submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses :
the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954. According’
to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau had ‘furnished
the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.
Senator Joseph R, McCarthy (R-Wisc) was Chairman of the Senate
Investigations Subcommittee.

General Mark Clark headed the Task Force which

surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55. In 10/54, CIA

alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop’
information regarding CIA operations. According to the Washington

. Star, 10/1/54, McCarthy said CIA was “one of the worst situations

we have as far as communist infiltration is concerned." He said
he would give his data relative to this matter to Clark's Task
Force. According to the Washington Star, 1/15/55, McCarthy

said he had given Clark information relative to alleged communist .

: infiltration of CIA.‘ As of 1/17/55, CIA had not received from

Clark the names of those considered security risks but CIA
peliéved it had done a good job of removing security risks and
believed that it was in good shape.

On 1/21/55, the Task Force requested name checks on

“security risks named by McCarthy. Memoranda containing the

results of those checks were given to the Task Force on 2/8/55.
On 5/13/55, the Bureau received a letter from Clark asking for
investigations relative to character, reputation,.and. loyalty
of individuals mentioned as security risks. CIA was aware of -
the names as we asked it for identifying data concerning ‘them.
Clark was later advised that the investigations would entail

source of the information set forth in our letter, The last
paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the
impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that
CIA had some coverage.reflecting there were to be troubles
concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter
also stated as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi-
vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your
arrival in a particular country. Therefore, there is a
question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist
organizations which would -have led to the development of
information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of
your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding
instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958,
The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director

had a discussion with, Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as -

the first sentence of the above letter reads as follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set
forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

- reports received from them on May. 14, 1958,"

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to
Mr. Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mr. R. R. Roach. to
Mr. A. H, Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for
the Director's information, The Director noted on this memo-
randum, "Send summary to A. G. H." In accordance with

. instructions, a letter was sent to the then Attorney General

‘under date of May 16, 1958, and this letter contained a summary
of CIA information in the same manner.as-had been sent to

tion that Ibe advised that if the information

Comments on Remarks in SA Papich Memo 3/5/70

1. That most of the information in our letter to
Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, came from CIA and that this
letter could be interpreted as raising the question concerning
the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

,

i There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-
tion which was summarized in our letter to Mr. Nixon, and we
clearly indicated in our letter ‘that the source was CIA. With
regard to any question being raised as to the quality of
CIA'S coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to :
Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader
of the CIA reports - - that is, that the information from CIA
popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and
Mr. Nixon's arrival. Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he
was personally involved in demonstrations directed against
him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that
advance information from our responsible intelligence agency
(CIA) may have been lacking.

2, We are not aware if CIA became knowledgeable of
our letter to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958. Under ordinary
conditions, we are not aware nor do we seek to identify any CIA

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the
Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70
discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief
that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance -
in collection of positive intelligence in the United States. 7
Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich
to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy
of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that
more aggressive action should have been taken in field of
| collecting positive intelligence in the United States. Papich |
—_ notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been
restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when
i ‘political crises occur in some country. He points out CIA belief
i that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-
lance coverage, development of informants and collection of
1 cryptographic material. Papich cites two specific cases occurring
' in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's requést for technical coverage,
[ + suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the.
t Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned set forth
with Director's comments relatiye thereto being noted. Our
policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field
by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) - copy attached, SAC letter calls for
guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingnéss to ‘cooperate
with CIA.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

SECRET

DETAILS:

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States
but he notes that there has been no.law, directive, or executive
order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of
such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,
and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and
that facets of these investigations of violations of United States
laws serve to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred
to by us as investigations of internal security matters. Papich
notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence
field has been restricted to the» compliance with requests by
State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring
in some foreign country.

Papich points ouf CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of
vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development
and collection of cryptographic material, According to Papich,
CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area
and CIA has been thwarted in-attempts: to do much about the
problem. Papich cites two cases (Alfred S. Gonsalves, 10/69 and
Zalman Shapiro, 10/69): where CIA requests for technical surveil-
lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these
matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the
Attorney General.

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,
changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate
international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the
Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA
regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United States.
On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with
CIA, the Director commented “I hope we still don't let our
‘guard down as CIA has always outsmarted us because of our
gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the .*
field and Bureau offigials results: of the conferences with CIA
and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction in
the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)
emphasized there is to be.no interference with or infringement
upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to
“cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the
United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director
noted "I hope there is no 'sneaker' in this. Time will tell.'.

There has been no renewed request from CIA for
technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there

of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to
bring about the necessary coverage. A good example is our involvement

in the development of information relating to the crisis in the Dominican

\ Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be "gray areas”
of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to
‘effect adequate coordinating machinery.

. The potential for the.development of positive intelligence in this
“country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected
overtly through the review of foreign and domestic publications, interviews
of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this
area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive
intelligence both agencies have an interest, and’there is a necessity for a
clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is
this true in the development of poSitive intelligence sources who are
employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States
or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

: For many years ‘he Bureau has had a continuing program of
developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging
our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for developing
positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in
formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA's need for sources i
positivejintelligence field

and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished
’ the necéssary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA
resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established
‘in January, 1964. _#

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA
as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be decided at the

Seat of Government. As a general rule, Bureau Headquarters will be, informed
by C14 regarding its interest in an individual or a target. Prior to notification



observations and recommendations before notice is transmitted to CIA. At
the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a
representative of DOD, CIA. Ifso, you should be guided by the enclosed
ground rules in any discussions, ‘bearing in mind that the approval for any
particular cperational activity is to be made at Bureau Headquarters.

You should hold to the concept that the protection of the internal
security of the United States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities
of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts

. which you may have with CIA representatives. ‘There is to be no interfer
‘with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unforeseé:
developments may create situations not adequately covered by the ground r-tes.
You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth
_ complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been informed
( by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be-
interfered with, we cannot discount the results of past experiences stem
from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reas
believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. Iti
therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown of
adherence to the ground rules. I emphasize that this is an area of activity
which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge. You
should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Bureau
can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this
entire matter. : 7

Dear Mr. Presidenit:

in reference to our discussion concerning the serious inter- -

quality, I have analyzed our coverage abroad.

We presently have eleven liaison offices located at Bern,
Switzerland; Bonn, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Hong Kong, British
Crown Colony; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Mexico City, Mexico;
\ Ottawa, Canada; Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Tokyo, Japan, staffed by
1 twenty-eight Special Agents.

With your approval, we are in a position to increase our Agent
complement abroad by adding one man each to our offices in Paris, Bonn
and Rome, /and two men to our office in Buerlos Aireg. We are alsoina

We feel the new offices, whieh'y ‘we ae be established, Poa
are desirable in view of the current crises in the Middle East and‘Vi fat ay Ye
which are subject to momentary escalation, and the recurring critical”
situations in Central America and South America. An office in Helsinki
would present the Advantage of having a listening post close to the Soviet border.

We are giving further consideration to expanding our domestic

sources of information, and this is/Lebanon. I say this
pecause I have known Mr. William J, ‘Baroody, Director of the

Pursuant to the Diréctor's request, we have considered how we sky
can increase our coverage for the purpose of developing high-grade political
intelligence, We feel we should (1) increase the scope and size of our
presently existing Legal Attache (Legat) operations; and (2) open several new
offices in selected strategic areas. We will, of course, explore opportunities
to supplement our production of intelligence by increasing domestic coverage
on diplomatic establishments of countries of particular interest where we
feel it-will provide information of the type desired. Our foreign coverage
can be. stepped up by assignment of 15 additional Agents abroad. tof

There are presently 28 Agents assigned to our 11 offices abroad.

: SECRET
Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

Re: EXPANSION OF FBI FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION EFFORTS

We have selected the six new locales for following reasons:
.

With respect to Tel Aviv, the Israelis have a most competent and
efficient intelligen¢e-gathering network relating to the Arab countries and our
efforts would be directed toward enhancing the flow of strategic information of
this type to the U. S. In Saigon, Vietnam, there is an obvious. critical situation
generating the development of political intelligence. We would also be in position
to develop on the spot the identities of Americans traveling in the area,
particularly those subversives who within our own country are asad toward
the overthrow of our Government,

Caracas (Venezuela) is the capital of a country which has been a
prime target for Castro infiltration and subversion efforts. In addition, from
this strategic point we would be in position to develop political intelligence

H regarding Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam. There
\- are strong anti-American segments in all these countries working to deliver
them to Castro, Communist China and Soviet Russia. San Jose is located in
Costa Rica, the southern-most Central American country excluding Panama.
All Central American countries are presently covered as a road trip by Mexico
City Agent. Establishing San Jose as a Legat post would put us in the position
of having an office strategically located to report regarding countries which

are almost constantly in a state of rebellion and change. We would, of course,
eliminate the road trip out of Mexico in establishing San Jose as a Legat post.

La Paz is located in the country (Bolivia) where "Che" Guevara
was killed. It is strategic in its location in that it borders Chile to the south’
where a communist regime is about to take over and Peru to the west which
is strongly anti-U. S. to the extent that U. S. interests are being confiscated.
Helsinki (Finland) is in a country bordering Russia and would give us a
strategic listening post in an area where there is a definite need for intelligence.
With respect to both Bolivia and Finland, however, we must be prepared to
encounter difficulties in establishing Legat operations because both governments
are oriented away from the U. S.

Expansion abroad would include the necessity of assigning additional
clerical personnel to certain existing offices as well as to the new offices.

Through past experience we know there is considerable high-level
political intelligence available within the U. S. which can be secured immediately

and with no risk through coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments by

technical surveillances. During past crises, such as those relating to the hi
Middle East, Panama, Dominican Republic and Cuba, we have been able to

produce especially significant data through technical coverage of selected
establishments.

We recognize that should we expand our foreign coverage, certain
problems would arise in view of Central Intelligence Agency and State Depart-
ment interests in this area. However, we do feel the Bureau could provide
information through the expansion outlined above which would be of benefit to
the President dnd that any objections which may arise from other agencies can
be overcome.

ACTION:
(1) If approved, attached letter will be sent to the President advising

him of extent of our present coverage, expansion of our current offices, and
establishment of additional ones as outlined above,

(2) If approved, we will submit our recommendations with regard
to expanding our technical coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments
within the U. S. for purpose of producing the intelligence required by the President.

(3) If approved, office of Assistant to the Director J. P. Mohr will
proceed to recommend the additional personnel described above.

(4) If approved, we will instruct all Legats to expand their current
coverage and to advise of their plans and recommendations for accomplishing

this.

suyect: THE LEGAL ATTACHE PROGRAM

From : H.-L. racer JR.

The Bureau’ $ ; Foreign Liaison Program has provwd to be an invaluable
adjunct to all categories of FBI investigative activity, particularly in view of the
proven incapability, if not indisposition, of CIA and other agencies to adequately
service our requests for inquiries overséas, or even more important, to aggressively
seek the manifold information of immediate value to the Bureau which is available
through well-developed foreign sources. It is obviously important to locate Legal
Attache (Legat) Offices geographically and to staff them in the manner that will
accrue to maximum advantae of the Bureau. The purpose of this memorandum
is, our request, briefly to analyze existing and potential foreign liaison coverage ,
from standpoints of both areas involved and personnel. This analysis willbe ,
separated according to the three principal areas in which Legats are assigned
Europe, the Far East, and the Western Hemisphere. Ser,

been regarded mainly as a "listening post" and was closed in; 1963 because of low
volume of work. Conceivably, if work in Africa increased greatly (it is now minimal),
jre -establishment of the Madrid Office should be considered. Another possibility

The Legal-Attache Program

Rome: © The Rome Office was cut in late 1967 from 3 Agents and 3 clerks to
Agents and 2 clerks. It is operating very smoothly with present complement and, an
in fact; Could carry a slightly heavier load. Legat Rome has substantially improved
the imperfect liaison which existed in its territory two years ago. Since 1967
road trip coverage of Turkey and Lebanon was discontinued as unproductive.
Coverage is now limited to Italy and Greece, with one-week road trips to Greece
made every other month. The cases developed from the-Greece road trip are
very routine in nature, consisting mostly of matters gleaned from review of U. S.
visa and immigration files in Athens. Assistant Legat Theodore A. Korontjis, who
mainly handles liaison in Greece, has informally expressed his intention of requesting
return to domestic assignment when lis present tour expires in 1970, It is believed

Replacement of Korontjis with a Spanish-speaking Agent would permit assumption
of Spain-Portugal coverage by the Rome Office, which Rome work load could well

Ee a Greek-speaking Agent is not essential for the type of work currently existing.

jaccommodate. Airline distance from Rome to Spain and Portugal is only negligibly
greater than from Paris.

London: Legat London's complement was reduced from 3 Agents and 3
clerks to 2_Agents.and_2 clerks in late 1967. Work load is heavy but actually no
more so than that of Legat Paris, who had adjusted to the reduction somewhat more
gracefully. Continued attention to conscientious streamlining and selectivity and
economy in direction of effort can enable the London Office to function effectively
with existing personnel. However, if assignment of additional personnel to Legats
becomes practical, and especially if the Spain -Portugal responsibility were shifted
from Paris to Rome, London, of the 5 European offices could best justify a personnel
increase, and increase of clerical complement from 2 to 3 could be considered
warranted,

Bern: Complement of Legat Bern (1. Agent : and 1 clerk) has remained
unchanged since the office was opened. Bern covers Switzeriand and Austria with
very occasional trips to the tiny principality of Liechtenstein.

Bonn: Complement of Legat Bonn was reduced in late 1967 from Agents
and'} clerks fo 2 Agents and J clerks, Bonn handles work in West Germany and thé
Neéthe¥fands:

Both the Bern and Bonn Offices are productive and well managed, but
do not have visible expansion potentials that would necessitate or justify
additional personnel. Bonn is in a position to release one of its 3 clerk-stenographers
whenever necessary during extended leave of employees in the other European
Offices. The Paris, London, Bonn and Rome Offices are all capable, through
good management, of releasing their second Agent temporarily for relief duty

as necessary in the one-man Bern Office.

Re: The Legal Attache Program

FAR EAST

We-have three Legats in the Far East: Tokyo, Sapan\/bantta i bat]
Philippines; and the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. All Jiaison in the
Orient was handled until 1961 by Legat Tokyo. The Manila Office was opened in
1961 and the Hong Kong Office in 1966 with appropriate allocation of geogaphic
responsibilities; Preponderance of work in all three offices, and particularly in
Tokyo and Hong Kong, has been in the security category -- with main emphasis
on Chinese Communist matters.

Tokyo* €1967 complement of the Tokyo Office was reduced J from,
2 Agent, and 2 Clerks to 1 Agent and 2 clerks. Territory covered includes
dapm, Republic of China (T: ina (Taiwan), South Korea and Okinawa. The latter 3 areas
are covered by road trip of about one week at 2-month intervals. Solidly established
sources provide a wealth of information of value to the Bureau, which of necessity
at present is processed most selectively by the Legat. Sufficient potential for
further exploitation of sources in Japan and Taiwan exists to justify assignment of
fa second Agent in event overseas expansion becomes feasible. Competence in the
Japanese language, written as well as spoken, is important. Clerical complement
at Tokyo had been 3 until about 1965, when it was reduced to 2. The office has
operated efficiently through extensively streamlining with the 2 clerks, and can
continue to function with this complement although supply of relief clerks by Tokyo
to other Far Eastern Officesyis difficult.

ae)

_-\Hon ONS Kong, Complement of Legat Hong Kong has been | Agent and |
clerk since time the office was opened, There are no road trips. Limited potentials
in the nearby Portuguese colony of Macao, plus hazards of travel to that colony
which is so susceptible to Chinese Communist encroachment and pressure, have
militated against official travel there by Bureau representatives. British authorities,
in approving our opening of the Hong Kong Office, were adamant that we not conduct
liaison with Taiwan from Hong Kong in view of the sensitive balance of British
relations with Red China. This factor has precluded our consideration of shifting
coverage of Taiwan (which is located about half-way between Hong Kong and Japan)
from Tokyo to Hong Kong. Major work of Legat Hong Kong involves file reviews
and liaison within the American Consulate General, which is one of the largest
consulates in the world, having more personnel assigned than our embassies in
many of the smaller countries. Of much importance also is liaison with Hong Kong
Police Headquarters and British Security Service (MI-5). Although Legat Hong
:Kong “vas continually pressed the Bureau for assignment of additional personnel,
the existing complement should be adequate if efforts are applied by Legat with
maximum efficiency. Liaison is conducted 100% in English, which is the official
language i in Hong Kong. Knowledge of Chinese is helpful in living in Hong Kong, but
is not essential.

Memo for Mr. Tolson SECRET

Re: The Legal Attache Program

Manila: There is very little activity of interest to the Bureau in the
Philippines. Our office was located there in 1961 largely because of its central
location with respect to Southeast Asia, All liaison in the Philippines is
conducted in English, which is the official language. Spanish is virtually useless
and study of the native Tagalog, Ilokano and Pampanga dialects is impractical.
The Manila Office since its inception has had one Agent and one clerk. Because
of dearth of work in the Philippines and wide extent of the territory, the Legat has
spent a large proportion of his time "on the road," covering all of Southeast Asia,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Australia and New Zealand. Much of his travel to far-
flung countries has been necessitated in the past by requirement that Legat
interview FBI National Academy candidates being sponsored by the Agency for
International Development (AID. Case load at Manila has dropped substantially
during the past 16 months, Manila if any F Far Eastern office, should be considered
for feadjistment of territory. The small amount of work existing in Manila itself
could be handled without difficulty b y Legat I Hong Kong (one. hour away. by. airjet).”
‘ight be Canberra,.Australia,
' or Bangkok, ‘Thailand, bo ntrally located, have more
| potential for expansion of FB. ative interests and present a more healtful,
j secure environment for clerical employees and dependents.

Vietnam: Another area of vital importance to the United States at
this time is South Vietnam, which heretofore has been considered part of the
Manila territory. Saigon currently is the seat of one of the largest U. 8. Embassies
in the world in terms of personnel assigned, with enormous U. S. Information
Service, AID, and other auxiliaries. The CIA operation in Vietnam is by far the
largest it has in the whole world. Although we have in the past had relatively little
case work in Vietrm, ‘unquestionably an FBI representative, if solidly accredited
to the Embassy, would be in a position to make an important contribution to the overall
; effort through police liaison, and would at the same time serve as a valuable listening
{ post for the Director. In any. expansion. | program it: it would ther therefore appear that
( Saigon should be actively” ‘considered.

Taiwan: As noted above, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has been
covered by Legat Tokyo. British attitude: makes coverage of Taiwan from our
Hong Kong Office unfeasible.

desirable fo retain two clerks i th the reduction in territory the
second clerk could be made available whenever required for relief duty in other
Far Eastern offices. On analysis, however, it would appear more desirable for
the Bureau to continue to cover Taiwan and South Korea out of Tokyo, as this,
assuming complement at Tokyo can again be established at two Agents, would

insure a source of Agent relief for the other Asiatic offices, at the same time
maintaining the economy of a more consolidated operation.

Re: The Legal Attache Program SECRET

WESTERN HEMISPHERE

We.now have 3 offices in the Western Hemisphere: Ottawa, Canada;
Mexico City, Mexico; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. :
»

Ottawa: Legat Ottawa has operated from the beginning with only one
Agent, but with 2 or more clerks. Following the impection in March, 1969,
clérical complement was raised to 3 and request of Legat for 1 additional ‘Agent
was denied. . Legat processes an enormous volume of investigative matters (484
cases pending on 3/31/69; 282 cases ‘closed during March, 1969), 99% of which
involve liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Although most
of the cases are stereotyped and are handled by use of form communications, the
very volume involved is greatly confining to Legat, limiting his availability for
personal liaison with the highly cooperative RCMP in matters of greater importance
to the Bureau, For this reason, serious consideration should be given when
practical to assigning a second Agent to ) Office c of Legat, , Ottaway im

Mexico City: Mexico City has a complement of 12 Agents and 12 clerks
(reduced from 15 Agents and 15 clerks following the inspection in February, 1969).
The office covers Mexico and five countries of Central America (Costa Rica,

El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Legat operates a large number
of informant nets in Mexico to provide intensive knowledge of potentially subversive
activities along the nathern border of the United States. Criminal investigations
involving border crossings are also numerous. During the recent inspection a
redimection of effort was ordered, to concentrate more fully on activities of

direct Bureau interest and less on matters where other U. S. agencies have joint
interest and responsibility. In view of this, it would not appear that increase in
personnel at Mexico in the immediate future will be justifiable, ae

a

Buenos Aires: The Buenos Aires Office was opened 3/31/67 coincident
with closing of the Rio de Janeiro Office: Territory includes Argentina, Uruguay
and Brazil. Staff consists of one Agent and one clerk, which was found to be
adequate during inspection completed 5/11/69. Work load is substantial, but
justification was not seen during the receat inspection for reopening the Rio de
Janeiro Office.

Other Latin American Countries: At present, no regular coverage is
} maintained by the Bureau in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,
\ Paraguay, Chile and other South American countries. Experience has shown that
well planned, aggressive liaison does produce worthwhile results for the Bureau in
cooperative foreign areas. While disposition of some of the above countries toward
the United States has fluctuated, the necessity of maintaining a position of intelligent
defense against the inroads of communism in the Western Hemisphere is clear.

‘In a notation on the attached routing slip of June 8, 1971,

' to the Director from Mr, Beaver, the Director asked for my views on

the subject matter -- the expansion of the FBI's Foreign Liaison personnel,
i offices, and activities.

1 I recommend the expansion for three reasons, as follows:
i

1, \The suggestion that we expand originated at the
White House, and was said there to be based on
ithe quality of information valuable to the President

hat we have been able to provide. If it is the

judgment of the President and his Advisers that

his Bureau is able to provide unusually good in-
| ‘ormation, and that they need more of it, we

certainly are in no position to deny or disagree,
It safely can be said that the people in the White
‘House know better than we the value of the infor-
imation which we have provided, I will trust their
judgment,

. 2. {It seems hardly open to question that the President
see | f the United States needs good information of this
gtype now more than ever before. Political, economic
x ; and social ferment abroad, all bearing on our foreign
‘ relationships, requires more and better information,
This hemisphere alone is a good example. In the
past we have had sporadic trouble with one banana
republic or another but never before have we had
a combination of such difficulties as now are en-
countered in Cuba and Chile which have been taken

The Director asked for my views on Mr. Sullivan's 6-page

our Foreign Liaison and proposing elimination of most existing Legal
Attache Offices either now or within six months.

Mr. Sullivan has not set forth any information which
causes me to change my position. Three important factors must be kept
in mind: (1) The White House requested both the recent expansion
and the proposed expansion; (2) what is of value to the White House is
political, economic and social information; (3) we are not attempting to
decide the question on the basis of “hard intelligence.’ ‘rhe White
House is not directly interested in Fugitives located, espionage

5. Identities of Bureau personnel below the Section
Chief level

The adequacy of Personnel Sections, in general,
disclose the extent of our commitment in specific areas of
counterintelligence activity. We have given the Committee
Administrative Division figures regarding total manpower
involved in security investigations but, to my knowledge, we
have not given them a breakdown as to where these personnel '
are assigned. A policy decision is necessary as to whether we
want to pinpoint, through release of "Adequacy of Personnel".
sections of these inspection reports, precisely how much or
how little manpower we have on specific types of investigations.

It is questionable whether the information regarding
- criminal cases in the San Francisco report is germane to the
Committee's inquiry. It would not seem improper to me to |
delete all references to criminal matters and merely substitute
‘a page saying that "pages - to relate to criminal
investigations." :

The percentage of all files (pending and closed)
containing substantive errors is 0.17% which is below the
field average of 0.29%, :

In pending files the percentage error was 0.12%
as compared to field average of 0.22%. This is a very
favorable comparison, however, the error percentage of 0.63%
in closed files is higher than the field average of 0.40%.
This would indicate that a closer review of files should be
made at the time of closing to insure that no further action
is warranted in those cases,

‘The subject of substantive errors should be dis-
cussed with employees of the San Francisco Office periodically
and all efforts should be made to eliminate errors such as
those set out above. F

A2.a. Communist Party (CP), USA
SF 100-11889
Bureau _100-3-23 : ‘
The Northern California District (NCD) of the
Communist Party (CP) is comprised of 48 counties in central
and northern California. The westernmost of these counties
are in the San Francisco Division; the easternmost are in
the Sacramento Division. Most of the CP activity in the
NCDCP lies in the westernmost counties, there being only ten
known CP members in CP groups in the Sacramento Division.
The CP maintains an office in Rooms 410-11, 942 Market Street,
San Francisco.

- The CP continues to act as an organization, holding
cP club, club chairmen and district meetings.

Principal activity in the CP in the NCD consisted
of financing, preparation and distribution of literature
th: “Reonle! s
World", the West Coast communist newspaper published in San
Prancisco, and activities relating to recruitment of new members,
for example, the formation of the local Young Workers Liberation
League.

Informants are members of most of the CP clubs in
jthe NCD. Some of these informants are members of committees
‘of the NCDCP. Also a number of them are officers in the various
cP groups. The identity of the members of the CP in the NCD
are obtained from these informants who report on activities of
old members, transfers of members, recruitment of new members
and cessation of activity on the part of others. Within a
short time after it ocors, any change in the membership is

reported. Since 4/1/70, as an example, the informants reported
two, deaths, 19 ceasing activity, 11 moving out of the district,
three on leaves of absence, two resignations, one expulsion,
four new recruits, five reactivations, and two transfers into
the district. - c 7 :

It is felt that the informant coverage is adequate.
It will be noted there are 20, informants who are members of the
‘cP in the NCD and two informants who are not members but furnish
information primarily concerning CP activity. It will be noted
the informant ratio to membership is appkoximately ¢ one informant
for each 8.5 members.

When an informant reports on a new member in the
NCD, a case is opened and assigned to secure background data,

to report subversive activity, and to make a recommendation
as_to Security Index.

Source of funds are from dues, sustainers and
assessments of members; from sale of literature; from
proceeds of fund raising picnics, dinners, bazaars and
similar affairs open to the public.

The main activity of the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP) and its affiliated youth group, the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA), since the last inspection has been working
toward the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. In this
connection, they have been the motivating force behind massive
demonstrations in San Francisco on 11/15/69 and 4/18/70
protesting U. S. presence in Vietnam. They have also
sponsored a petition which resulted in a referendum to be
voted on in San Francisco on 11/2/70 putting San Francisco on
record as being opposed to the war. The SWP is also in the
forefront of the Women's Liberation Movement, utilizing it as
a means of attaining the appearance of their political candidates
on college campuses to speak on the subject. When dealing
with youth, SWP activity is carried on in the name of the YSA
but as the YSA is completely controlled by the SWP, members who
comprise a majority of the YSA membership the name utilized in
public activity is irrelevant. Funds are derived from members'
sustainers, literature sales, and outside solicitation of funds.
Although constantly in arrears in nay to the Netional-
Office of the SWP and the YSA, they a t appear to have any
financial crises at any time. Informant coverage is adequate
at present but efforts will be made to develop additional
coverage to provide fox continuing coverage jin the event current
informants. are discontinued for any reason. New members are
identified by member informants. The membership of the SWP
in this area is approximately 99 according to member informants.
The membership of the YSA according to member informants is
approximately 90.

RU publications describe RU as adhering to Marxist-
Leninist-Mao Tse-tung thought and advocating necessity of
armed revolution to destroy United States imperialism and
establish dictatorship of proletariat. Members of leading
body, Political Committee, state all members armed. At
Central Committee meeting weekend of October 10 and 11,.1970,
75 delegates present and informant who was present estimates
75% to 80% advocated armed struggle now. RU going national
j “and has started collectives in Northwest, Chicago area,
Detroit, and in several major cities in East. Chief sources
of funds are membership dues and profit from sales of publi-
cations. RU publishes three newspapers and has significant
control over a fourth. Has published three issues of
theoretical journal "Red Papers." RU concentrating on
revolutionizing of workers, college and high school students,
looking towar@ formation of national Marxist-Leninist Party _
capable of seizing control of the United States. RU active
in strikes around the Bay Area, college demonstrations, and
in community affairs, tenants unions, welfare, and education,
Increased emphasis being placed on weapons training and
affinity groups being organized for action in demonstrations.

RU members are identified mainly through live
_infoxmant coverage; fisurs and, where possible, photo
coverage of known RU meetings. Additional names of RU
membership is self-identification in RU newspapers, and
- coverage of RU communications by SF_3247-S,. Estimate of
- RU membership in Bay area based upon figure quoted to
ember informant by RU Chairman in 9/70. Rapid membership
SRereEge Sreribtted to heavy emphasis on recruiting during
past year, less insistence on ideological purity in
recruitment and increased recruit potential caused by
breakup of SDS. Whilé present informant coverage
considered adequate on overall RU activity, it is felt
member informant coverage should be increased on area
basis to identify individual members. so they may be placed
on SI.

The Bay Area Progressive Labor Party: (BAPLP)
membership is made up primarily of individuals in their early
twenties. The organization in the past held and is presently
holding classes on Marxism for potential members and for
further education of old members. The BAPLP is not holding as
many public forums and open meetings as it has in the past.

The BAPLP is active in the Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) at the University of California at Berkeley, San Francisco
State College in San Francisco, and Merritt College, Oakland,
California. The BAPLP has a number of SDS sympathizers who
have aligned themselves with the PLP line and become BAPLP
candidate members. The PLP is concentrating its main efforts
on-student activities. This is the area where they hope to
recruit new members. The BAPLP membership is estimated to be
between 45 and 50. There has been no significant change in
membership since the last inspection. Some members have moved
out of the area and several have quit the Party. The Party is
hopeful of gaining new members primarily from radicals on campus
and is having some success. Efforts are being made to secure

Ye 2 additional member informant coverage in the BAPLP. BAPLP

The San Francisco chapter of the National Lawyers
Guild (NLG) operates a legal referral service and its members
have provided legal defense for Communist Party members as
well as anti-draft and racial matters and are presently taking
a participatory interest in the Soledad Brothers by providing
counsel for imprisoned felons, Funds” are derived from
membership dues.

The Northern California Committee For Protection of
the Foreign Born is in effect dormant, has only $30 in its
bank account and holds no meetings or functions. Unless an
immigration proceeding or legislation dealing with immigration
policy arises, the organization will remain dormant. Funds are
no longer being solicited.

Northern Californians Against Repressive Legislation
(NCARL), formerly known as the Northern Californ
the House Internal Security Committee, changed its. “name to
broaden the scope of its activity. Its main activity is the
dissemination of literature attacking specific legislation.
Meetings are held primarily to solicit help in mailings and to
discuss progress in influencing citizens and members of Congress.
Funds are derived from public donations solicited in mailings.

clish

The American-Russian Institute (ARI) exists mainly

“as a distribution center for the dissemination of Soviet :
propaganda throughout Northern California and as a contact point
for Soviet exchange students, visiting Communist dignitaries, and
other visitors from behind the Iron Curtain. Funds are raised
by monthly contributions and a large fund raising dinner held
annually on the anniversary of the Russian revolution.

The “People's World" (PW) newspaper has two or three
fund-raising affairs yearly and numerous small meetings such as
. breakfasts for fund-raising purposes. Its annual fund drive and
subscription drive quotas are usually met.

The Guardian has not held any public meetings during
the last year. In April, 1970, Guardian workers in New York
revolted against Guardian policy and began publishing a
“Liberated Guardian". The Guardian no longer has a representative
in the San Francisco area whereas the "Liberated Guardian" lists
approximately seven individuals on its Bay Area staff but has
held no meetings of a public nature.

The last inspection coincided with the famous Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) June 1969 Chicago Convention
in which the then SDS leadership attempted to expeli the
followers of Progressive Labor Party (PL). PL controlled the
major local campus SDS chapters at the University of
California, Berkeley, and San Francisco State, Anti-PL chapters
of SDS existed for a few months at Stanford University and
San Jose State College, but as SDS became less massive as an
organization controlled by PL these members drifted into groups
such as the Revolutionary Union (RU). Lack of communication
and organization, as well as a National SDS debt, constant
appeals for funds, and continued ridicule by RU and Weatherman
groups have all contributed te further diciategzatica of SDS.
Demands indigensus to the Student Movement have been ignored
to concentrate on PL's program of "Build a Worker~Student
Alliance" (WSA)., At a western regional conference held at
Berkeley, California, September 26, 1970, SDS attempted to
re~organize with delegates from throughout the West, Some
eriticism of PL was voiced but PL continued to dominate,
calling for a demonstration at San Jose, California, November 3,
1970, in support of striking auto workers, SDS/WSA distributes,
when funds available to print it, “New Left Netes", published
at Boston but more regularly distributes “Challenge”, publication
of PL, SDS/WSA Western Regional Conference was only able to
raise $150 toward $5,000 National Office debt.

The Bay Area Peace Action Council (BAPAC) is a
coalition of various anti-war groups in the San Francisco area |
whose sole purpose is the immediatewithdrawal of all U. Ss.
troops from Southeast Asia, BAPAC is not a membership : |
organization, however, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a
controlling force behind it, simply because numerous SWP
members attend BAPAC meetings regularly. Funds are derived
from public solicitations. :

The Student Mobilization Committee (SMC) is a

The Venceremos Brigade (VB) of the San Francisco Bay
Area is affiliated with the national organization headquartered
at New York, New York, and is principally active in the
recruitment of individuals for the VB sponsored contingents
to Cuba. There are no local independent publications of the
VB. Confidential informants continually report a lack of
funding and finances. There are no key activists directly
affiliated with the VB.

The Newsreel in San Francisco was established in
May, 1968, as a branch of the New York Newsreel, a radical
film-making group. Articles of Incorporation, pursuant te
non-profit corporations under the laws of the State of
California, number 58415, were filed in the Office of Secretary
of State, California, November 5, 1969, The Newsreel makes
and distributes films that depict ideas and information that
the Government and the news media tend to choose to ignore,
In the spring of 1970, the Newsreel bagan work on two new
films, one on the history of labor and the other on the
history of the women's liberation struggle. Persons who have
had some activity in the SPS and related groups in other
parts of the United States have been some of the leaders of

The White Panther Party (WPP) in Berkeley isa
small group which seems to center its activities around
drug usage and communal living activity. The group has never
been identified as a significant force in the radical scene
at Berkeley. There are no Key Activists in the Berkeley
group. Recently, the WPP have been “hangers on" at the office
of the underground newspaper "Berkeley Tribe".

The WPP of Marin County began in May, 1970. The
two leading figures among its’7 - 10 members are DENNIS MARNELL
and RICHARD LORD STARK, both Priority I Security Index Subjects.
This group lives in communal style. To date, the group's major
activity is the free distributing of food purchased with food’
stamps. : ‘i

Activities of the WPP in Palo Alto currently are
being directcd primarily by Revolutionary Union leaders who
the WPP members. The activities have
been limited to collecting weapons and demonstrating around
Lytton Plaza public meeting controversies. WPP has announced
its intention to "blow up a pig station" but no action along
these lines have been evident to date.

virtually no San Francisco area YIP activity and YIP was only

sources to record contemplated movements; through employment
sources, when the individual is regularly employed; through
bank sources to ascertain details of income, particularly the
sources thereof; through targeting informants who are in or
report on the groups in which the particular key activist is
associated, These informants are impressed with the
importance of developing a working relationship with key

with the Palestinian liberation movement, The newspaper is

“Ramparts", a monthly magazine, has had as its
principal backer EDGAR’ LOCKWOOD. He recently withdrew
financial support“in protést 6ver the magazine's radical
tone of late. The last issue pleaded for financial assist-
ance.

The three major weekly underground papers are the

- "Berkeley Barb", the "Berkeley Tribe", and the 'Good Times".
The “Tribe" for the past month has pleaded for financial
aid to keep going. The "Barb" is the only one that is a
financial success. While reporting news of interest to
activists in the New Left, the "Barb" can sustain itself by
printing nude pictures, running several pages of sexual
want-ads, as well as advertisements from local movie houses
that feature erotic and pornographic movies.

New Left subjects in this division have been known to
have foreign contacts and/or have traveled abroad as individuals
or in groups, particularly in the ease of the Venceremos

us in many instances to be aware of their plans prior toe
actual departure from a country. Since the VB is an one

sub-culture which engages iu this communal Living.

Extended coverage has been given to those addresses

in the San Francisco

Division since May, 1970, has followed a trend from mob action on
campus to off-campus bombings by terrorist groups.



4-8-6

During May, 1970, the final series of the Spring,
1970 campus’ demonstrations occurred on the campuses at Berkeley
and Stanford. June and July, 1970 brought a number of bombings
and attempted bombings against off-campus institutions of the
establishment. It appears that several groups other than Weatherman
participated in these bombings as Weatherman communication was only
received regarding the bombing of the Hall of Justice in Oakland,
California, on July 30, 1970.

: The months of August and September, 1970, were unusually
quiet with no demonstrations or bombings. It was not until the
fall offensive announced by BERNARDINE DOHRN.in the fifth communi-
cation from the Weatherman underground on October 6, 1970, that a
new series of bombings began.

The October 7, 1979 bombing of the San Rafael Courthouse
was claimed by the Weatherman and it appears that the other attempted
bombings and bomb threats came from terroristic groups which respon-

. ded to Wetherman's cali for a fall offensive. :

7. In response to Bureau tektype, dated April 17, 1970,
the San Francisco Division advised by teletype dated April 20,
1970, that an additional 28 Agents would be needed with an addi-
tional sven Agents for servicing of sophisticated coverage to
implement the irtensified investigation against New Left violence.
,In our teletype of April 20, 1970, it was indicated that the peak
. ‘number expected to be assigned to these investigations was 46.

As of June 15, 1970, a New Left Violence Squad was set
- up in this office consisting of 24 Agents, broken down as to 17
Headquarters Agents and seven Resident Agents, of whom four were
exclusively assigned to the handling of New Left extremist matters.
One additional Agent is on transfer to the New Left Violence Squad
_ for a total of 25. . : :

: Based on current available manpower and the present
investigative demands on this office, it is believed that the Bureau!
program of intensification against the New Left has been implementec
up to this time. However, in view of the new Bureau jurisdiction of
arson and bombing matters and the tremendous number of individuals in

. the San Francisco Bay Area who have accepted the hippie culture and
way of life among whom are the New Left extremists and fugitives,
the task of locating, identifying, and apprehending these
individuals thus poses an extremely difficult challenge.

By airtel, dated September 30, 1970, the San Francisco
Division has asked for an additional 26 Agents. Of this number
five will be assigned to the New Left Violence Squad, five will
be assigned to the squad hndling the Venceremos Brigade, six will
assigned to the squad handling the Revolutionary Union, and ten wil
‘be assigned to handle the additional work load in the racial field.

De ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS a
1. Espionage and related matters are handled on Squad 8,

which is composed of a supervisor, 17 agents in headquarters,
{ and 4 resident agents. As of 10/12/70, the case load was 742
cases. In addition to Espionage and Internal Security responsi-
| bilities dealing with the Soviets, Chinese and the Satellites,
| this squad also handles various nationality groups, such as
the Arabs, Iranians and Yugoslavs, and also handles the investi-
gation of the Revolutionary Union (RU), which is the largest
Maoist-Marxist-Leninist organization in the Bay area openly
espousing. the overthrow of this government by force and violence
and which is discussed elsewhere in detail. This squad also
handles Mexican-American matters which are in their relative
infancy but appear to be trying to follow the path of the
blacks in their efforts to obtain more recognition for their
——-problems. The foremost tasks presently facing this squad in
their order of importance are:

(1) Coverage of the Soviet poneuletee which is in
7 the process of being established;

(2) Coverage of the RU;

Hee (3) Coverage of the Chinese, which has taken a new
turn subsequent to the Chinese government policy now of going
international and its recognition by Canada and the contemplated
establishment of a Chinese Communist Consulate in Vancouver;

| i (4) Coverage of Mexican-Americans;

. (5) Coverage of Soviet students (there are 7 in the
ie Bay area); nisttl : :

(6) Coverage of nationality groups, such as the Arabs,
Iyanians, Yugoslavs, Cubans and South Americans, and

(7) Fisur coverage of other Soviet Intelligence
officials visiting this area, handling cases from other offices
and satellite programs and illegal agent programs.

With respect to the Inspector's comment on priorities,
I would like to suggest that serious consideration be given to
setting out priorities on situations before the fact rather than
waiting until the problems have become so serious. Specifically
it is believed that the following. serious and important matters



“2 2- 4-F-G

now basically in their infancy in San Francisco should receive
greater emphasis in determining the present overall Bureau
priorities.

(1) The Soviet Consulate. Four officials have now
arrived, including the Consul General Designate and the Vice
Consul Designate, and have obtained house-keeping apartments.
All indications are they are here to stay, to be augmented to
_ 20 - 30 families when they locate their space. Three of the
four officials are known KGB and this fact should certainly

be meaningful to us. Furthermore, in no time in this country's
history have our students, scientists and men in the Armed
Forces let their moral standards deteriorate to such a low
degree, Certainly the Soviets will capitalize on this
deterioration. In addition, the San Francisco Peninsula

area is one of the most important centers of electronic and
scientific resoarch in the tmited States.

(2) Coverage of Chinese Espionage. Within the past
week Canada has recognized Communist China and information
indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate will be opened in
Vancouver.- Already we have seen contacts between pro-Chinese
Communist elements in San Francisco and New China News Agency
personnel in Vancouver. This, coupled with the recent indi-

-cation that Communist China is now ready to come out of its

shell and now concentrate on improving its international position,
will cause greatly increased activity in the Be ed field in
this area. . :

(3) The Revolutionary Union (RU), which was only
founded in 1968, has grown from 1969 ‘to 1970 from 120 to 350
members, according to estimates given by its Chairman in 9/70.
12 deve.lopment..of.the RU.. hh osely-paralleled..recent
directives from the CCP of China for at ist-Leninist organi-
zations Oh outside. Of Chinato Gri shed wand. during the
past s Six months has assumed a national posture with development
of collectives in the mid-west and East. At the Central
Committee meeting within the past week, 70 to 80% of the
delegates favored armed revolutionary struggle now.

(4) Mexican-Americans. This field is in its infancy
but could prove serious inasmuch as revolutionary organizations,
such as the white radicals, are making determined efforts to
revolutionize and recruit within the Spanish-American community.

Mexican-American Militancy

The San Francisco area, with its large numbers of
Spanish-speaking residents (90,000 to 100,000 in San Francisco),
is becoming one of the centers of the developing militancy of
this group. 7

As of the present, the most important local group
is LOS SIETE DE LA RAZA (The Seven of the Race), aka (SF file
100-63425). This group was established in May, 1969, for
the purpose of obtaining adequate legal counsel for the seven
Latinos charged with killing a San Francisco Police Officer
on 5/1/69. The group was quickly taken over by militant,
radical Latinos who have guided it into more radical and
militant channels, with close ties to such groups as the
Black Panther Party, Revolutionary Union, Youth International
Party, etc. It has a newspaper, "BASTA YA," and has expanded
its activities into such “communi ty~oriented" wore as a “People's
Clinic" and "children's breakfasts.

The second most important local group is the VENCEREMOS
COLLEGE (SF file 100-65241), located in Redwood City, California.
This is part of the NAIROBI College of East Palo Alto,
established in 1969, following the confrontation of Third
World students with the College of San Mateo. ON_MANGANIELLO ,
Direstor,of VENCEREMOS COLLEGE, was expelled £ro1 —_ Mateo
College asa result of this confrontation. 7

H This college is primarily for young Chicano students,
and its stated goal is to produce “revolutionary technologists-
doctors, lawyers, teachers," It is a two-year college, and
claims to be accredited. MANGANTELLO states the directors

are Marxist~Leninist, and the class stressed is the political
education class in Marxism-Leninism. Tuition is free.

One of its programs is the establishment of “united
front organizations," such as the “People's Medical Center" in
Redwood City, Welfare Rights Organizations, and a Daycare
Nursery.

6. Chinese Matters

Although the ethnic breakdown of the 1970 census is
not yet available, it is estimated by the San Francisco Public
Health Department, that persons of Chinese descent constitute
approximately one-tenth of the population of the city. This

- percentage has risen constantly during the past two decades
and is expected to rise at an increasing rate in view of
liberalized immigration regulations and the tendency of certain
other groups to move out of the core city. The estimate of
approximately 70,000 Chinese residing in San Francisco is
matched by an equal number in other Bay area cities, making
the total Chinese population of the San Francisco Bay Area
somewhere between 140,000 and 150,000 persons.

The report of the San Francisco Chinese Community

_ Citizen's Survey and Fact Finding Committee, issued in 11/69,

- points out that the San Francisco Chinatown is not simply an
area but in fact, "a City within a City," with “its businesses
and commercial district, light manufacturing and industrial
areas, schools, churches and parks and its different housing
areas, both public and private." The fact that Chinese are
now widely dispersued throughout the city, Chinatown remains
crowded, with a population density about ten times that of
the city as a whole. Although more and more Chinese are taking
up residence elsewhere in San Francisco, and in nearby cities,
most still retain Chinatown ties and many commute daily to
their businesses or offices in Chinatown. All of these
considerations affect the investigation of Chinese matters
and it has been found that the development of Nationality
Sources and the promotion of community relations is particularly
effective in the expeditious handling of Chinese investigations.

The San Francisco Office has sources in all of the
important organizations and groups in the San Francisco China-
town. Nationality Sources of this office serve on the board
of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, commonly

called the Chinese Six Companies, which is made up of the
Presidents of the seven major Chinese District Associations,
(associations of persons who trace ancestry to one nea another

Perhaps the most important investigation in the Chinese
field at present is that entitled "Chinese Voice," IS-CH, which
appears to be shaping up as a major propaganda effort of the
Chicoms. This investigation, discussed in more detail elsewhere
in this write-up, is’ expected to become more time-consuming, as
it appears that the. the editor JOU, Sic CONG, will be successful
in securing Chicom Financial support to make the paper into a

.@aily publication. Recently ONG, accompanied by several other
‘Chinese from this area, traveled to Vancouver, Canada, to

welcome the crew of a Chicom ship and ONG made a banquet speech

in which he clearly disclosed Chicom sympathies. The individual

Two organizations at San Francisco that are considered

pro-Chicom are the Hai Yen She (M), commonly known as the

‘Petrel Club (Bufile 105-13332; SF File 105-869), and the Red

Guard (Bufile 105-189989; SF File 105-23956).

The Hai Yen She (M) is the descendant organization
of the Chinese-American Democratic Youth League which in the
1950's had a fairly extensive membership and was actively pro-
Chicom. At present the organization is "officially" disbanded,
but ‘it remains an informal group of Chinese who are pro-Chicom
in sympathy and who hold weekly discussion meetings attended
by approximately ten -persons. - =

roup... It is also noted that individuals who are associated
with “JOHN..S,.C24,ONG.. and. the "Chinese Voice" include persons
who were formerly quite active in the Hai Yen She or its
predecessor organization. MAURICE CHUCK (Bufile 105-19681;

SF File 105-1493), who was once Educational Director of the

Chinese~American Democratic Youth Club, is now the Managing

Editor of the “Chinese Voice."

The Red Guard grew rapidly in 1969, by absorbing
Chinatown youth gang elements. However, adverse publicity
and the positive action of certain Chinatown tongs which took

action to absorb some of these youth and to place them under

so that no more than ten youths are now subject to the
direction of its leadership. SF 3250-PSI was former,

Minister Of infornta tts principal
leader, recently traveled abroad as a member of the ‘Delegation
\ to North Korea and North Vietnam, led by the Black Panther
\ Party (BPP) leader, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, Undoubtedly, this
travel, which included visits to Soviet Russia and to Algeria,
will make it even more necessary to cover HING.s activity as
a Chinatown militant.

The Asian American Political Alliance, which only a
year ago was a center of Orlieiial protesi activity at the

i University of California at Berkeley, California, is now a
dead issue due to dissension in the Asian Studies Division
of the Ethnic Studies Department at that university. According
to SE.2496-R, a leader in these groups, the Asian Studies
group is divided between moderates who want to remain in the
university framework and radicals who want to organize the
Asian Studies Division into a community college, divorced
from university control and oriented toward community action.
This Asian Studies group maintains a community center in the
International Hotel at San Francisco, as well as the Chinatown-
. North Beach Draft Counseling Center and Everybody' s Bookstore,
- dealing in Chicom and New Left literature, in that same Hotel
building. A

Agency representatives at Vancouver, Canada. When an official
Chicom Consulate is established at Vancouver, many Chinese
from San Francisco will undoubtedly contact that Consulate

and these contacts as furnished by the RCMP will have to be
checked to determine their significance.

Another program with potential for producing a break-
through into Chicom Intelligence activity is that entitled
"Chinese Communist Contacts with Scientists in the U.S.; IS-CH,"
(Bufile 105-168542; SF File 105-21705) recently Tnsituted by
the Bureau to try to take advantage of Chicom interest in

the fields of nuclear energy,,missile and. aerospace research,
Submarine development, and biological and chemical warfare, —

to develop double agents among: Scientists in those fields.

Related to the Chinese field are the investigations
in the Revolutionary Union category, including that of its
leador, LEIRET RERCMAN, who returned to the United States
from China with the mission of setting up such a revolutionary
group. Individual discussion of both the Revolutionary Union
and its leader are set out elsewhere in this write-up.

7. . Nationalities Intelligence Matters:

an Although there has been no evidence of anti-communist
group activity which could be considered embarrassing to our
government, there does exist a potential among the Arab
students, Iranian students, and the Yugoslav emigre groups.

Pro-Arab activity offering potential for illegal
activity and violence centers in Arab students of the several
Bay area campuses. Their primary interest at present is to
support the Palestinian Arab cause. Demonstrations along
this line to date have been orderly and sentiment expressed
has been critical of both the USSR and Arab governments as
well as Israel and the United States.

The Iranian Student Association has chapters in the
major colleges in the San Francisco Bay area. It advocates
the overthrow of the government of the Shah of Iran. It is
also critical of U.S. "Imperialism," USSR and its cooperation
with the United States, and it supports the Palestinian Arabs.
It has sought and had the support of the SDS in its demon-
strations. Its demonstrations have been generally peaceful
excépt on one occasion demonstrators invaded the Iranian
Consulate and had to be forceably evicted by the police
department. 41 of them were arrested.

Ariong the Yugoslavs, the Ustashi element of the
Croatian group have exhibited bitter resentment to public
appearances at Croatian emigre social affairs by representa-
tives of the Yugoslav Consulate, San Francisco. Via their
weekly radio program they criticize the present communist
regime in Yugoslavia and strongly advocate a "free Croatia."

The Chetnik element of the Serbian group also’ voice
their criticism of the present communist regime in Yugoslavia
via their weekly radio program.

There has been no acts of violence perpetrated by
the Yugoslav group in the San Francisco Bay area. They have
on two occasions formed picket lines in the vicinity of the
Yugoslav Consulate protesting the Yugoslav communist govern-
ment but on each occasion they registered same with the San
Francisco Police Department. 7 : :

San Francisco is aware.that the West Coast is of
increasing interest to the SIS, and the anticipated opening
of the Soviet Consulate as tuphasized ine needa for the develop-
ment of an adequate pool of sources, informants and double
agents which will assist in our efforts to effectively cover
the intelligence activities of the Soviets.

To further implement the instructions of the Bureau
in this Facies San Francisco has obtained from the Defense
Supply Agency the identities of employees of industrial” firms
who p. an travel to or through Sino-Soviet bloc countries or
who plan to attend an international meeting outside the U.S.
where Sino-Soviet-bloc personnel may be present. These persons,

- on a selective basis, are interviewed to alert them to the
- possibility of foreign intelligence recruitment, and their
DESECO potential is then evaluated.

Counterintelligence Against Communist Party USA:

No occasion has arisen where it was felt that

any counterintelligence action action would
heighten existing tensions or create

disruption, so no authority for counterintelligence
action was requested of the Bureau,

Counterintelligence Against New Left:

The continued fragmentation of New Left Groups
and the criticism of ‘one group dy the otter
has narrowed opportunities under this program,
SDS/WSA local campus chapters are constantly
labeled "PL stooges" by other campus groups,
The attendance of such large student groups as
World Christian Liberation Front (WCLF) at
Regional Convention of SDS to preach the
Gospel was more disruptive than any program
we could suggest to Bureau. The WCLF delayed
the West Coast SBS Convention one half day
until the SDS removed the WCLF and its student
members to the outside, where they continued
to pray for forgiveness of the SDS and to SDS
to refund their registration fee, As a
combined result of University and local
prosecution virtually the entire leadership

of such groups as Berkeley SDS and Campus
Progressive Labor Party are currently under
suspension and many have felony indictments
pending against them. Our prompt notification
of such agencies as INS and request for regular
notification of action taken by them in case

of kexsies disrupters has resulted not aa
necessarily in statistics under this program

put results in keeping with spirit of program.
While suggestions made under this program

tangible results are not evident because

with the disruption carried on by one group
against another greatest care must be

exercised to prevent involvement that could

result in criticism of Bureau,



Co Disruption of any Other Subversity Group .

Based upon information from member. informants

to your office concerning intent to “blow up the Hall of Justice"
in San Francisco emphasizes the need for your office to establish
administrative devices which will readily make available
pertinent information relating to the stockpiling of weapons

of violence by extremists; in addition, it resoundingly points
out the need for additional in-depth informant coverage in
security matters, particularly of activity of extremists

appears you have "member informant coverage" in the Old Left
(CP). .

see You are making some inroads into the problems of the
New Left, the overall security picture of the San Francisco

77.



Office clearly indicates that the need for an imaginative,
aggressive, well-organized program to obtain "member informants"
in all known extremist groups, collectives, and basic revolu-
tionary organiations in order that your office will be in a
position to fulfill the Bureau's responsibility in this field;
the re-establishment of a Soviet Consulate in San Francisco
creates a most serious investigative responsibility to your
office; daily coverage will be expected of all phases of

Saeviet activities which again emphasizes the need of all types
of coverage; the Revolutionary Union (RU) (comprising an
estimated 350 members in 41 collectives of which only 145 have
been identified and 73 placed on the Security Index) additionally
emphasizes that an aggressive, imaginative approach must be
taken against groups of this type.

Continuous terroristic violence encouraged by fanatics
and revolutionary groups, organized and unorganized, squarely
affixes San Francisco's responsibilities in the security field,

The foremost objective in the security field must be
“member informant" coverage to identify and infiltrate ail
revolutionary and extremist groups with the goal of prosecution
and/or complete extinction of these groups. Quality "member"
informant coverage in leadership position (in violence-oriented
groups on andoff campuses) is a prime and critical factor that
“must be kept uppermost in the mind of responsible supervisory
and investigative personnel through sound administrative and
investigative programs on a day-to-day basis.

Simply stated, "the name of the game is ‘member informant
coverage’ in all basic revolutionary and extremist groups" so
the Bureau will be in possession of advanced information on all
pertinent contemplated acts on the part of these groups and
the prosecution after the act. The Bureau cannot take "NO" for
an answer. : : q

‘tion which is set forth as follows of

The above clearly points out the critical need for
in-depth member informant coverage in all of the above areas
set forth. In this regard, you should promptly make a thorough
analysis of your security informant program, insuring that all
weaknesses therein are promptly corrected in order that optimum
informant coverage is obtained from available informants in order
that necessary informant coverage is obtained at the earliest
possible date.

BASIC REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS castes ‘
COMMUNIST PARTY, USA :

As reported by you to answers posed by the inspectors,
the activities of the Communist Party (CP) in the San Francisco
Division appear to be adequately covered by member informants;
however, you should insure not to lose sight of the fact that this
coverage can fluwtuate daily. You should insure that informant
development in this organization is not relaxed in order that
you will always have adequate coverage. A review of files relative
to New Left organi zations and individuals reflects that your inves-
tigations in this area are conforming with existing Bureau instruc-
tions,

The one problem area indicated in the New Left extremist
type organization is the Revolutionary Union (RU). Accordingly, an
in-depth analysis was made of the problems involving this organiza-

t : ersceg! i

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

The RU has had an alarmingmembership growth from fifty
members at the time of the last inspection to 350 members at
present. The growth of the RU has closely paralleled recent
directives from Communist China for a Marxist-Leninist organiza-
tion outside of China. During the past six months, the RU has
assumed a national posture with the development of collectives
in. the Midwest and East. At the Central Committee meeting
(governing body) held within the past week, 70 per cent to 80
per cent of the delegates favored armed revolutionary struggle now.

The RU in your territory is presently made up of 350
members in 41 collectives which are located in San Francisco and
seven Resident Agencies: Berkeley, Oakland, Palo Alto, Richmond,
San Jose, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz.

‘oc


Of ‘the 350 members, San Francisco has identified
as members. A total of have not been identified. This is
a most serious problem which must be rectified immediately.
The lack of appropriate quality informant coverage in,39,of the
RU collectives is the prime reason why this unfavorable ‘situation
exists, At present you have only three member informants furnishing
information in two collectives located in San Jose. One of these
informants is a acing Conmittes.andsitlbe, in a. position

onthe. Stee
to furnish you badly needed informant coverage of the RU governing
body.

You have two informants who are furnishing you valuable
information concerning the RU; however, they are not, actual members .
San Francisco has five potential security informants who appear to
have excellent chances of being accepted as members. Agents handling

these informants must give them close and continuous guidance in an
attempt to have them gain membership.

Of the members identified, a total of 73 have been

included in the Seclrity Index. The investigations Wicerning the

other 72, known members should be expedited and appropriate reports
submitted to the Bureau together with recommendations for placing
these individuals on the Security Index.

. As you are aware, the Department of Justice advised on
May 19, 1970, that it was considering submission of a petition

to the Subversive Activities Control Board to designate the RU a
Communist front. Because of the Department's interest in the RU,
you should keep the Bureau advised of all pertinent information and
activities of this organization.through timely letterhead memoranda
and/or appropiate reports suitable for dissemination.

Aggressive and continuous investigations mus t be afforded
the key leaders of this organization.

This entire matter must receive close supervision to
insure that the Bureau's responsibilities are fully and properly
met. :

HW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 230



The extent of extremist activities such as those
adhered to by the Revolutionary Union and the Weatherman
Faction of the Students for a Democratic Society is further
emphasized by the statements of MARK RUDD, leader of Weatherman,
to the extent that in 2/70, a meetingwas held in Cleveland,
Ohio, at which time Weatherman decided to go underground
and direct "strategic sabotage" not so much at Federal Buildings
but at military and police institutions. One of the centers
of Weatherman activity was designated as Berkeley, California.
Therefore, you should insure that aggressive and’ penetrative
investigation is directed in this area not only to identify
known Weatherman members but to locate and apprehend Weatherman
fugitives.

.In regard to RUDD's statement as to-strategic sabotage,
the above stated acts of Vidlence indicates that Weatherman
in this area may be responsible for such acts, it being noted
that RUDD did not indicate any specific target other than the
sabotage was to be directed against symbols of the establishment
and particularly through confrontation with police and
accomplishing accompanying acts of sabotage through the use of
bombs and other explosives. In this regard, your attention is
directed to SAC letter 70-46(F) dated September 1, 1970, cap-
tioned "New Left Movement-Violence~Internal Security-Miscellaneous
(Weatherman) which relates that recent developed intelligence
information unquestionably indicates the FBI, its field offices
and its Resident Agencies throughout the country are vulnerable

_ to the terroristic tactics of these madmen.. No office can

consider itself immune to such action;accordingly, you should
be constantly alert for same. in

The foregoing emphasizes the importance of penetrative
aggressive investigation and the development of "member
informants" in these organizations. It is further emphasized
by the activities of extremists throughout the U. S. who, during
the past academic year, were involved in excess of 1,785
demonstrations on college campuses: During these demonstrations
over 7,116 individuals were arrested and damage to campus
facilities amounted to more than $9,563,000. Approximately
300 police officers and 163 participants were injured during
these incidents. Recently at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, Wisconsin, a bombing caused one death and $3,000,000
damage to a building on the campus. During the period of



i

- lls |
x i |
September, 1969 to August, 1970, there were 15 | ceances
of bombing and/or arson. Damages as result of these instances
amounted to more than $11,454,500. This compared to the 65
acts of violence, 503 arrests, 103 police officers injured,
11 deaths and estimated damages of $961,443 in’the San
Francisco Division clearly crystalizes the problem that your
office faces in combating these new left extremist groups.
You must insure that the Bureau's responsibilities in this
regard are fulfilled. :

Stockpiling of Arms

and Ammunition

Your attention is directed to SAC letter 70-18(C)

xelating to explosive incendiary devices and bomb threats.

The files of the San Francisco Office in: regard to
the stockpiling of arms and ammunition by extremists indicates
a need for a definite program set up by your office to insure
that you are aware of the thefts ot weapons and other insicu-
ments of violence with emphasis being placed on identifying
whether or not such weapons of violence are falling into the
hands of extremist groups.

In connection with the reported thefts of weapons
of violence you should insure that all informants (both
security and criminal) are promptly alerted regarding such

‘thefts to aid in determining if any of these weapons of

violence are being sought after or stolen by extremists.

Counter-Intelligence Programs

A review of the San Francisco files ‘in regard.
to the Counter-Intelligence Program of your office reflects
that serious imaginative and aggressive thinking has been
directed in this area with particular emphasis against
iain and Weatherman extremist groups.

An effective Counter~Intelligence Program against
basic revolutionary groups is a prime aspect in neutralizing
the potential of these groups. Accordingly, you should insure

, that this program continues to receive your close supervision

and direction in order that counter~intelligence can be
implemented where it will be most effective. One such area
would be in directing your attention to violations of laws
under the Bureau's jurisdiction wherein the members are reported
to be connected with extremist groups. In this regard, your
attention is directed to the Selective Service Survey (being
reported elsewhere in this inspection writeup) wherein it

is pointed out that nine individu. 2 revorted to be
affiliated with extremist groups haing violated the Selective
Service Act. In this regard, you should insure necessary -
administrative controls are set up so such indicated violations
are promptly brought to the balchetaiobeceta of the ie teehee
supervisory personnel.

Security Index

A review of the overall operation of the Security.

Index was made and it was determined that it is being maintained

in a current status in accordance with Bureau instructions.

It is noted that you do not have photographs for four Security
Index subjects and that photographs of 74 Security Index
subjects are over ten years old. You should make every effort

'to immediately obtain current photographs on those Security

Index subjects which you do not have a photograph and, if
possible, obtain current photographs of those Security Index
subjects that are over ten years old.

ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS

: 1

With the signing of the Consular Convention Agree-
ment between the United States and the Soviet Union, June 1,
1964, negotiations have been conducted concerning the establish-
ment of Consulate Offices. In April, 1970, negotiations
established authority for the Soviet Union to open a Consular
Office in San Francisco which will cover the states of Oregon,
Washington, California, and Hawaii, plus Kodiak Island and the
cities of Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska.

As you are aware, the Soviet Union previously had a
Consulate in San Francisco and Soviet personnel assigned to
this Consulate were extremely active in espionage activities
up to the time of its closing in 1948. With the establish-
ment of a Soviet Consulate in the State of California, a state
with a large ethnic Russian population, the largest Communist
Party other than New York, and rife with extremist groups of
both the New Left and Black Nationalist type, it is obvious
the Soviets are presented with unlimited potential tor
successful espionage operations. The area to be covered by
the San Francisco Consulate is one in which are located many
key facilities and vital military installations, including
the Defense Language Institute, Monterey, California.

During the negotiations for the establishment of 4
this Consulate, it was contemplated that eight to ten Soviets
would staff this establishment. It now appears the. Soviets
contemplate assighing about thirty families to this Consulate.
At present two Soviet officials have already arrived in San
Francisco area. These individuals have previously served in
the United States and were connected with Soviet Intelligence.
The Soviets are presently in the process of establishing the
Consulate and are seeking to purchase a building and other
equipment and supplies. They are presently being assisted
by two Soviets assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington,
D.C. On 10/27/70, an additional Soviet arrived in San
Francisco, presumably to assist the above-mentioned Soviets.
At least three of these Soviets are known KGB agents.

The need for daily and thorough investigative
coverage and close supervision of the above-mentioned Soviets
and those who will bea is absolutely necessary and
expected. :

The seriousness of San Francisco's continuing
investigative responsibility in covering all phases of

Soviet activities in San Francisco henceforth cannot be over-
emphasized. You must personally follow all pertinent develop-
ments in this matter on a daily basis. It will be your
responsibility to appropriately apprise offices covering the
territory of the Consulate relative to their travel to those

areas, such as Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, pony
cna Anchorage and Honolulu Offices.

The thorough daily investigation of the activities
‘of the Soviets assigned to your Consulate is without question
as important as any investigative responsibilities you have.
The Bureau.expects you to fulfill all phases of these
responsibilities in a thorough and exhaustive manner.

To date the actual purchase of a building which will
house the Consulate and anticipated living quarters for the
goviets has not been made. Possibility exists that after
this purchase is made renovations to the building may be
necessary to fulfill the overall needs of the Soviets. If
this possibility becomes a reality, the lapse of time in
completing such renovation may delay the arrival of the fvll
complément of Soviet personnel.

7 The San Francisco Office has been aware of the
possibility of a Soviet Consulate being established in San
Francisco for several years. The Bureau has given you
numerous instructions in this regard. In September, 1969,
Bureau instructed San Francisco to immediately institute
a vigorous campaign to develop a pool of suitable DESECO
sources for use against Soviet personnel.

At the present time you have three PSI~DESECO, two
of whom have been placed in contact with Soviet-bloc officials.

! In addition, since the last inspection you have opened 108
| DESECO cases, Closed 50 of them, and you presently have 58
pending cases. This is a distinct and worthy improvement
over the last inspection when you had 19 pending DESECO
cases. In addition to the above DESECO potential, you have
three dormant double agents, FLIP, ES aI B LS toe oie Se
134-4408, and SF 3385-8. 134A BI Oat, who may eventually prove
valuable to San Francisco in its coverage of the Soviet
Consulate. Agents handling these informants should remain
alert for the appropriate opportunity in placing these
individuals in contact with the Soviets.

It is essential that you vigorously pursue an active

DESECO Program and insure that individuals are being developed
whose background would make them attractive to Soviet

Intelligence. This program must be expanded and receive
imaginative and continuous attention. At the present time
in your coverage of the Soviet officials who are presently
in San Francisco, you have the following basic coverage in
handling the daily activities of these Soviet officials:

With the opening of the Consulate and the arrival
of Soviet personnel in your division, it is most essential
that consideration be given and efforts be extended to not
only evaluate individuals for potential defection but to
actively work toward inducing a defection in place recognizing
that such a source has proven to be the most productive
and positive means of penetrating Soviet Intelligence.

It should be expected that there will be an increase
of Soviet Intelligence official and non-official travelers
from New York, Washington, D.C. and abroad to the San Francisco
area. It, therefore, would appear mandatory that increased
attention and coverage be given to such individuals.

In addition the opening of a Soviet Consulaté in
San Francisco undoubtedly will stimulate the increase of
Soviet Intelligence effotts in the area of your division,
beth in the legal and ilieyai intelligence field. This
fact will certainly necessitate the need for alertness on
your part to uncover this activity. You must give consid-
eration to means to uncover such efforts by Soviet Intelli-
gence and be certain personnel working on Soviet cases are
experienced and qualified. Sufficient manpower and attention
must be given to all facets of these endeavors.

With the establishment of the Consulate and
considering the nature and makeup of the Bay area which has
numerous private and governmental plants of a technical and
sensitive nature, it is imperative that the contacts of the
Consulate and its Soviet personnel be immediately identified
and thereafter exploited.

Surveillances of the Soviet personnel must be
vigirously conducted and consideration given to new sophis~
ticated means to determine the movements and contacts of
these Soviets. The Mast monitoring survey suggested by your
office and now being conductéd shduld receive continuous
attention and implemented if feasible.

Soviet Bloc: Immigrant :
(SOBIR) Program :

Since the last inspection you have had 413 cases
referred to you under this program by U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service or other government agencies, and
you opened 89 of those cases and interviewed 26 persons.

At the time™Of the last inspection you had 337 such matters
referred to you, opened 89, cases and interviewed 16, indivi-
duals. Because of the excellent potential in developing
worthwhile sources in this category in connection with the
coverage of the Soviet Consulate, it is imperative that you
scrutinize each SOBIR case to insure that all potential is
exploited to the fullest.

Visitors to Soviet-
Bloc Countries

Over 3,000 individuals in you. texzitory have
traveled to Soviet-bloc countries since the Ist inspection.
Of this number, you have interviewed 104 individuals, 4 who
visited the Soviet Union. Of these Lf ‘individuals it”was
determined that one individual encountered a recruitment
approach and no persons wére recruited. This program should
receive renewéd emphasis by your office in further develop-

. Ment of a wide variety of quality source coverage of the
Soviet Consulate.

Soviet Students ae aa : : eee set

At the present time you have seven Soviet students
attending universities located in your territory. Your
coverage of these students is through various sources, and
it ‘is noted that you are continuing to develop additional
sources, It is imperative that their activities be closely
followed, according-to existing Bureau instructions. For
all practical purposes, these students should be .considered
part of the Soviet Consulate complément.

_ Chinese Matters

Serre pee ~i.
San Francisco has the largest Chinese colony in the

United States. A review of your files concerning Chinese

matters shows that you have conducted numerous interviéws

under the Chinese Alien Interview Program. These interviews

have alerted many of the immigrants to our interests in the

event they are contacted by individuals or groups which may
be of interest to your office,

As you are aware, within the past week the Canadian
government has recognized Communist China and information
developed indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate may
be opened in Vancouve, Canada, in the impending future. This
Consulate will certainly produce an increase in "contact
cases." It can be expected that many Chinese of the Chinese
Community in-the San Francisco area will undoubtedly contact
that Consulate. The Chinese Communist government will
undoubtedly be vitally interested in developing sources
among the Chinese population in the San Francisco territory.
San Francisco has seen contacts between pro-Chinese Communist
elements in San Francisco and the New China News Agency
i personnel in Vancouver. This, coupled with the recent indi~
: cation that Communist China is now ready to come at of its
shell and concentrate on improving its international position,
will undoubtedly greatly increase activity in the Chinese
field in San Francisco territory. The need for developing
DESECO sources and quality Chinese confidential sources is
necessary and desirable if you are to fulfill your responsi-
bilities in this potentially critical investigative area.

- Your investigation concerning the "Chinese Voice,"

a . Chinese~language newspaper, clearly shows that this paper

ig developing into a potential major propaganda effort of the
Chinese Communists. Your investigation in this regard appears
to be progressing satisfactorily.

SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM

"The Bureau has repeatedly stressed and the above
analysis emphatically points out the necessity of establishing
in-depth, quality informants in the racial and security field.
This fact is even more imperative now than ever before in view

particularly involving extremists as the upsurge a violence
is rapidly increasing.

The files of your SIs and PSIs have been reviewed
and individual ratings have been prepared and made available
to you concerning each file. The ratings given the informants ©
are as follows:

Excellent Very Good Good Fair Total

SIs
PSIs’

The atcve infe t that was rated fair is San ae
Francisco file number 13 1, Bureau file number 134-4238.
This informant should be closely followed by you for 90
days. Specific assignments should be given the informant
during this period. However, at the end of 90 days if no
positive improvement is shown the file should be closed.
The Bureau should be advised of the action taken as to this’

the 90 day period.

In addition to the above a representative number of
the files relating to 161 potential security informaats under
development (non-Bureau approved) were reviewed. From the
ratings given the above SIs and PSIs (considering 23 SIs
are reporting on the Communist Party)clearly indicates this
program needs revitalization within your division to fullfill
the needs of coverage on the extremist groups. Primary
weaknesses noted were made subject of separate memoranda relating
to failure to "contact informants" and the destruction of
channelizing memoranda. Copies of these memorandam will be
found elsewhere in this inspection report. Another weakness
noted in a review of these files was that informants did not
appear to be given sufficient, definite and varied assignments
in order to utilize and develop their full potential. It is
felt that through close guidance and direction of informants
currently available to you, you will greatly increase badly
needed coverage in critical areas,

97,



i 14

arias. You should insure that imaginative and aggressive
steps are.immediately taken in order that the San Francisco
Division has sufficient informant coverage in the security
field to meet and fulfill the Bureau's responsibilities

in this area.

You are reminded that in developing informants,
ofttimes monetary remuneration is a prime factor, coupled
with the need of a proper rapport between the agent and
the informant to fuily develop the potential of the informant.

In regard to the expenditure of funds for security
informants and sources the San Francisco Division for the
period September 1968 to August 1969 expended $80,123... 45.
for informants and $311.00 for sources, while during the”
B56.789.62 for oo Tough erteas 1570 it expended

76,789. or informants and $1,505 for sources. While
you Should insure that value is received for funds expended,
you should also be certain that all agents are aware of the
! importance of financial remuneration in deveiopiny.: iufurmatits.

In addition, it should be impressed upon all agents
.of the San Francisco Division that each has a responsibility
of pinpointing security informant potentials for further
development by agents handling security matters.
an : In connection with the overall administrative
‘ handling of the informant files of your division 2.3 in
addition to the weaknesses pointed out in the memoranda
referred to above, it was noted that the "pink sheet" in
several of these informant files were not completed. The
identities of these files were called to your attention
«. and the completion of these “pink Sei should be accoriprished
at an early date.

OBSERVATIONS

From an overall analysis of the security matters
in the San Francisco Division, it appears a prime factor
for a successful operation in this area is the close
coordination of the three security squads along with the
racial squad in view of the scope of the problem dealing
with extremists in this area. This is necessary to insure
that each desk is madeaaware of the pertinent information
relating to the operation of that desk.

HW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 241 :


15

Another impotant and prime factor is the fact that
your office must develop "member informants" in each extremist
group and organization in order that you will be in possession
of advanced information on all contemplated acts of violence
or other pertinent acts on the part of these groups prior to
the act taking place. :

INSTRUCTIONS

The Bureau must be immediately advised of any
outbreak of demonstrations, or proposed demonstrations
within your division. In this regard you should insure
that all employees are aware that such activities which
occur during the night within your division are brought
to the Bureau's attention by the opening of business at
the Seat of Government the following morning. This is
extremely important as the White House, the Attorney General
and other interested Government agencies rely heavily on
the Bureau to keep them advised of subversive and New Left
activities throughout the United States.

Promptly review your overall operations relating
to your informant program, correcting any weaknesses therein
to insure an effective program is in operation to develop
"memberiinformants" for in-depth coverage in all revolutionary
groups, branches and other affiliations of these groups.
“In this regard it should be stressed to ali agents that
, each have a definite responsibility in this area.

In connection with the violence-oriented extremist
groups, you are reminded that a group of like-minded individuals
can be as dangerous, or more dangerous, than well-organized

“extremist groups. This is pointed out by the increase of
unprovoked attacks against police and the increase of acts

of violence, not only throughout the United States but in
particular in your division as indicated by the above related
statistics. With this in mind, you should insure that informants
are given assignments in conjunction with the group the
informant regularly covers to: (1) cover unaffiliated
extremists; (2) search out and identify unaffiliated extremists;
(3) attend public meetings held by extremists; (4)survey
extremist bookstores and other areas where extremists are

known to congregate; (5) insure informants are alert to
violations of both Federal and local statutes by extremists,
particularly those involving weapons of violence as such
violations may be an important factor in directing a
counterintelligence operation against the extremists.



- KW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 243

‘

- 16 - 7

By giving informants these and other assignments to actively
seek information relating to extremists, the informant will

be reporting.on a regular basis and thereby be more productive
in aiding and affording the necessary coverage in this area.

‘Closely follow investigations relating to all
communes within your division to insure existing Bureau
instructions relating to such communes are followed. -

Insure all informants are alerted to the theft
of weapons of violence that could be utilized by extremists
to fulfill their announced intentions.

Insure that ail informants are properly indoctrinated
in accordance with existing Bureau regulations with primary
emphasis on prompt reporting of information if in a travel
status to the nearest FBI office.

You should insure that an imaginative and aggressive
counterintelligence program is considered against basic
revolutionary groups insuring such programs are properiy
cleared with the Bureau.

In regard to developing informants, particular
emphasis must be made in the "member informant" coverage of
each of the 39 Revolutionary Union (MU) collectives.
Identify the 205 unidentified revolutionary members and
conduct appropriate investigation and iat Security Index
recommendations.

Expedite background investigation of the 72 known
members of the RU who are not on the Security Index“and
submit reports and recommendations for. placing them on
the Security Index.

You should insure that your office is adhering
to the Bureau deadlines in the submission of reports on
all individuals and organizations.

You should insure that necessary administrative
procedures are set up so that any member of an extremist
group who has violated a law under the Bureau's jurisdiction

“within your division is promptly brought to the attention of
the responsible desk.

In view of the clear danger the establishment of
this new Soviet Consulate presents to your office, it is
imperative that your overall counterintelligence efforts
be immediately implemented to meet your responsibilities.

Initiate a vigorous program to develop a pool of
additional quality sources under the DESECO Program.

Immediate steps must be taken to consider . tesur

coverage and misur coverage.

Promptly institute appropriate jookout., surveillance.
and substantive case coverage of present Soviet officials.

Adequate surveillance coverage must be established.
These Soviet officials will be permitted to travel throughout
the Consulate district and thus will be in a position to

Washington, and Los Angeles.

Closely follow Soviets purchase of Consulate building
and immediately upon ascertaining the location of the building
purchased, immediate steps must be taken to arrange suitable
iookout and tesur coverage of this establishment’.

You must develop an ropriate lookout on the

Soviet Consulate to vigorous seme ement “the "Cc Contact program.

have these cases assigned to Agents on your racial squad?

PART I. INVESTIGATIVE ASPECTS

A. Since the last inspection the territory covered
by the San Francisco Office has experienced no mass demonstra~
tions, riots or confrontations of a racial nature. The period
has been characterized as an organizational drive for minorities
other than black. These other minorities are of the belief
that the blacks through organizational activity, demonstrations
and violence have gotten and are receiving a disproportionate
share of Government funds and attention. All of these groups
want what they believe is their fair share and that is one
hundred per cent of all that is available. This development has
had a sobering effect on black demands, by occupying their time
attempting to hold on to their recent gains.

Spanish surname groups are the most advanced in their
organizational activities, with Chinese groups fvliuwing.

The violence problem involves the shooting of
policemen and numerous bombings.

In San Francisco alone in 1970, four police officers
have met violent ends. On 1/1/70, Officer ERIC A. ZELMS, age
22, was killed by two black robbers. On 2/T87 70, Sat, BRIAN V. Vv,

“MC DONALD was killed in the bombing of the Park Poliée’ Station.
Those responsible have never been determined. On 6/19/70,

_ RICHARD RADETICH was shot through the head in the early morning
hours white writing a traffic ticket in the Haight-Ashbury
District. Those responsible are unknown. On 10/19/70, Officer
HAROLD whee AMILTON, was killed by a bank robber.

Outside of San Francisco, most notable incidents of
the killing and wounding of police officers are as follows:

Black Panther Party (BPP) Capt. RANDY WILLTAMS on
the evening of 4/17/70, with two others in Oakland, shot
up a police paddy wagon being driven by two officers. Both
officers were wounded. Weapons used were both automatic
and conventional. Another police vehicle responding to the
officers' in the paddy wagon call for help came under gunfire
and was hit five times. Those responsible for the shooting
who were fleeing in a stolen vehicle in order to effect an
escape fired a shotgun and threw a hand grenade or bomb at

a

the police vehicle. A second grenade or bomb injured a bystander
and her five year old daughter. As a result of Willians.
participation he was indicted for attempted mur er and is
awaiting trial.

: In San Jose on August 6, 1970, during the early
morning hours, Officer Richard.Huerta was seated in his police
vehicle with a traffic offender who had run a red traffic
signal. Emil Aubert Thompson, a San Jose State College law
enforcement student, walked up to the police vehicle and
emptied six shots at the officer, resulting in his death.

The twenty year old bystander admitted the killing and

claims the act resulted because he hates cops and subscribes
to the BPP philosophy. His father is a veteran policeofficer

In Berkeley on August 20, 1970 after midnight,
Officer Ronald T. Tsukamoto was citing a motorcyclist for
a traffic violation. A young black bystander engaged the
otticer in a brief conversation betore pulling a gun
and firing two shots at point blank range, fatally wounding
the officer. 7

on August 7, 1970, a shoot-out occurred at the Marin q
County Civic Center, which is in the greater San Francisco :
metropolitan area. An unsuccessful attempt by three convicts 1
vand an accomplice to escape from a court room resulted in the i
death of a Superior Court jurist and three other persons, i
in addition, wounding a Deputy District Attorney and a juror. F
Angela Yvonne Davis, a self-admitted Communist Party member, }
Wr proressed revoliitionary and a recently dismissed Philosophy
instructor at the University of California at Los Angeles,
was charged with kidnapping and murder for her part in the i
abortive escape attempt. Davis was apprehended by the FBI in ,
New York City on October 13, I =e and is awaiting extradition i
to California. i
}
?

An example of an act of extreme violence occurred on
October 8, 1970 at 1:27 a.m. The same Marin County Civic ;
Center where the judge and three others were killed was :
bombed by persons unknown. Partially destroyed was a Superior :
Courtroom which suffered extensive damage.

HW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 252 2



In the opinion of many, a definite contributing
factor in the killing of police officers and other acts of
violence by extremists is the BPP official publication,
"The Black Panther". This weekly newspaper prominently
features and eulogizes so-called revolutionary acts
by any blacks. +

There is every reason to expect a continuation
of. violence against police officers and bombings of public
and military buildings.

Since the last inspection, no institution of higher
education has experienced racial disruptions in the territory
covered by San Francisco. Some gang-type trouble has been
experienced in the high schools and these disturbances
break down along racial lines but are unorganized. An
example of such trouble occurred on October 20, 1970 at the
Woodrow Wilson High School in San Francisco. The school
has 2095 students, the vast majority of which are black.

Gang warfare broke out between the blacks and Samoans.
Only 25 Samoan students attend this school.

D. Plans to Expand Informant Coverage : |

There is presently underway a plan| through which BPP

is hoped this effort will result in coverage at the top level
of the BPP.

A comprehensive interview program remains in effect
under which all BPP members and ex-members are being interviewed
at least once and many several times, depending upon their
intelligence and the likelihood of their eventual cooperation.
Toney is mown to be an essential factor and they are advised
of its availability in exchange for their full cooperation.

“The BPP is not presently accepting members; however,
this office maintains several informants as close to the BPP
as possible for mediate infiltration into the Party should
the bar to new members be dropped.

The California Depart
local polite desartiients, “tat
Identification and,,Anves.t;
racial, and security ‘Tnf orm re reminded repeatedly of our
continuing need for good quality informants. All the above-
named agencies have at one time or another provided this office
with the’ name of a potential source and continue to do 80.

All Agents investigating extremist groups and/or
individuals are constantly reminded of their responsibility
to develop quality informants and neighborhood sources on
each and every group and individual under investigation. The
development of adequate Live informant coverage in all areas
receives constant and close supervision.

Black extremist groups under jeaabiitihiansaiiibiie and
members targeted include the following

(These individuals were specifically
targeted on authority of the Bureau for
repeated interviews because of their positions
as leaders in the BPP. In reality any member

. or leader of the BPP who becomes dissatisfied,
disappointed, or irritated with the BPP or one
of the leaders is immediately targeted for
interview. The San Francisco Office is always
alert to this possibility throvgh established
sources.)

Nation of Islam

(This organization has committed no violent
acts and its membership has remained relatively
fixed for over two years. Present informant
coverage is considered more than adequate. ):

In the past the 3BSU at San Francisco State College has
been the only other Black Extrenist organization worthy of note
on college campuses. This organization has been practically
emasculated; however, by the firm stand taken by San Francisco
State College President S. I. HAYAKAWA. It is unlikely it will
become a viaole“Oreanizacion Again this school year, but if it
does, CSSF_3060-S is am er and in a position to provide the
needed coverage. In ‘Addition, JERRY VERNADO, an ex-BSU
at San Francisco State has been interviened with some success
in the past and further steos are being taken to gain his con-
fidence. BSU's on other college campuses in past years have
not committed any acts of violence and established sources advise
none are expected to occur this year. :

F. All ghetto and racial informants are solicited
repeatedly for the names of individuals who they believe can
possibly be of assistance to this office in providing the in-
formation needed in racial matters This technique has proven
to be of value as a source for new “informants. Where possible,
ghetto informants are utilized to cover public functions,
rallies, or meetings sponsored by militant groups. They are
provided assignments where compatible with their ability and
encouraged along these lines so that their usefulness to this
office is fully exploited.

All racial informants are constantly educated and
‘reminded of the Bureau's responsibilities in the racial field
and the need for timely, accurate intelligence information on
all militant individuals and organizations and their activities.
They are encouraged to engraciate themselves with and to seek
the companionship of individuals in positions of leadership
and to spend as much time as possible in and around the offices
and pads and in the company of individual leaders. Emphasis
is placed on determining the likelihood of racial violence and
the locating of weapons, ammunition, and explosives. Assign-
ments are immediately given to resolve any rumors of the
stockpiling of weapons or explosives. Successes are rewarded
by increased payments and bonuses. otes .

All Agents handling racial and ghetto informants have
been repeatedly reminded to report and flash all statistical

hal.



accomplishments on FD-209's or informant contact memos. These
particular memos are then routed to the racial informant co-
ordinator who includes the statistics on the FD-l05p submitted
by hin monthly. : :

‘

Gee All racial and ghetto informants have been alerted and
are constantly reminded to immediately contact this office tele-
phonically for instructions in case a racial disturbance appears
in the making or is underway. All Agents are alerted to contact
their sources dy telephone or any way possible. ‘The office main-
tains a ghetto informant card index filed by area. The card con-
tains the informant's place of residence and employment and the
‘telephone numbers so he can be immediately contacted should the
disturbance be in the area he covers.

J. Liaison with major law enforcement agencies
within the San Francisco area is specifically assigned to
Agents on the Racial Squad. Liaison with other law enforce-
ment agencies throughout the San Francisco Division is
assigned to appropriate Resident Agency or Headquarters
Agents; and this liaison includes campus police, parole
authority, State Attorney General's Office, California
Department of Identification and Investigations (CII) as
well as county and municipal police.

A very close relationship with continuous exchange
- of information is enjoyed with San Francisco and Oakland,
California Intelligence Units, both of Which are aggressive,
Sn east aan peo mam ma tae
effective, units?

Close contact is also maintained with 115th
Military Intelligence Group, Secret Service, Internal Revenue
Service; and all State and Federal agencies are contacted
immediately when information is received which should be
disseminated to them. Likewise, San Frauciscw's Liaison
contacts insure that any information of interest to the San
Francisco Division in the hands of local or Federal agencies
will be furnished to San Francisco Division without delay.

San Francisco participates in bi-weekly conferences
with intelligence agencies of the Army, Navy, and Air Force,
one purpose of which is to review the potential for racial

“violence. The San Francisco racial supervisor regularly
attends these conferences.

Very good relations are enjoyed by San Francisco
with all local and Federal ‘law enforcement and intelligence
agencies. 7

K. Anytime a militant organization or group

appears to be taking shape or a legitimate group appears to
become militant a case is immediately opened on that organi-
zation. The first order of business then becomes the
development’ of an informant from among the group and/or the
infiltration of that group by an established source. All
Agents are alerted to the need and requested to cooperate.

It becomes the direct responsibility of the case Agent to
follow and assute that adequate live informant coverage is
available on the organization. When coverage decreases from
loss of an informant for some reason, the need is again pin-
pointed and all Agents are requested to assist with

suggested replacements. The assistance of all police agencies,

axrole and probation officers, State A Attorney General's Office,
Ghetto, criminal and security informants ié"solicited in
attempting to fill in any gaps in informant coverage. Close
supervision is afforded informant development.

PART II. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS

A. The racial informant control file in the San .-
Francisco Office is 170-22. A separate control file has been
opened to coordinate the development of a top level BPP infor-
mant (170-1030). The counterintelligence file is 157-601.

B, Individuals identified as members or affiliates of
racial extremist groups come primarily from live informants
and from the technical informant coverage. Channelizing
memoranda are prepared by Agents handling live informants,
the memoranda routed over the desk and new cases opened
promptly where warranted. Information originating from
technical coverage is reviewed daily by Agents who prepare
individual memoranda. These memoranda are routed across
the desk and new cases opened promptly.

The key racial extremists are kept in a pending
status. Information from all sources are channelized to
the files and these files are followed closely on tickler
to insure continuous investigative effort. 7

c. The primary responsibility for reporting to the
local police that information received from informants rests
with the case agent handling the informant. The Agent when
dictating the information received from informants remarks
that the information was given to the local police. The
supervisor when initialing the report for duplication checks
“to ascertain that proper dissemination has been made.

D. Agitator Index cards and Security Index cards are
current. Case Agents have primary responsibility and squad
supervisors reading reports and reviewing files on ticklers
check to determine whether individual names of Subjects
should be included on any index.

E. The Black Nationalist Photographic Album is main-
tained in the supervisor's office. Necessary changes are
routed to the Squad #9 secretary who makes the changes or
inserts the form into the album, and initials the accompanying
letter. Case is assigned to an agent for periodic review.

F. There are no active extremist organizations in San
Francisco Division in which the case agent has failed to
develop an informant. It is to be noted, however, that the
BPP case is assigned to SA RAYMOND N. BYERS who, because
of enormity of the investigation, acts only in a coordinator

capacity. The overall investigation is handled by the racial
squad and several informants have been developed as indicated
in Part I, Sections B and E.

G. All Agents operating racial informants have been
advised to report all statistical accomplishments in the
criminal field on FD-209's or contact memos and to flash same
for the attention of the racial supervisor. These memos or
FD-209's are then routed to the racial informant coordinator
for inclusion in the FD-305=B submitted monthly.

PART III, OUTSIDE INFLUENCE IN RACIAL ACTIVITIES (BPP)

The Legats and CIA have been continuously requested

to observe foreign activities of persons and groups sympathetic
to the BPP. Considerable material has been received relative
to such organizations as BPP Solidarity Committees.

A close study is made of "The Black Panther"
newspaper for evidences of foreign ideology.

All BPP bank accounts are regularly monitored to
detect any SOSE IETS" LOTS To TURUIN EOE Ee BPP cme:

The BPP does not have any indigenous philosophy,
and has borrowed heavily from the writings of various
world-wide revolutionary figures, particularly those from
the Far East. However, except for repeating old Communist
cliches, the pulicy of the BPP is Lasically oriented toward
the problems of the people of the ghetto streets, the lumpen
proletariat, as they call themselves. The BPP will accept
help, both physical and financial, from anyone desirous of
donating. However, they seldom help anyone else and, in
fact, have engaged in an exchange of polemics with William

., Negro spokesman for the CP, USA, which ‘organi-
‘zation, in spite of a luke-warm effort to influence the BPP,

has had very little visible effect on the course of the
Party. :

Informants have been alerted to report any such
influence and careful review of all material received from
technical coverage of the BPP is analyzed to insure any

information pertinent to this problem is reported.

Top level informants in the NOI report no outside
or foreign influence in this organization,
ie ij :

|

B. The effect of New Left and Communist influence

on the BPP has been negligible. The BPP from the beginning
has been almost solely interested in the problems of the
community blacks, and while repeating Communist and/or
Socialist type slogans, have seldom rendered any assistance
to groups from these leftist organizations.

The BPP attorney is Charles Garry, former CP, USA
member and leftist oriented thinker, who is, in all
probability, responsible for the leftist slant to BPP
publications, slogans, and teachings. The most prominent
instance of the cooperation between the BPP and the white
radical left came in the National Convention of the United
Front Against Fascism (UFAF) held in Oakland, California,
in July, 1969. Up to this time, the BPP had been an all-black
movement, having as allies such "cultural nationalists" as
Stokel armichael and JamesForman. With the UFAF, it
SE es Ee nee an new development was on hand, as CP, USA
and New Left leaders converged on the gathering and made
speeches. However, a split ensued between all groups, i.e.,
between the biacks and the whites, and between ceriain
elements of the radical whites. The CP, USA fell out with
the New Left, the Jews criticized the BPP for its anti-
Israel stance, and the PLP attacked and was counter-attacked
by the others in the New Left. This grand design came
apart and eventually Eldridge Cleaver began writing of the
CP, USA in the past tense, and attacking Negro writers for
the "Daily World" and the "Guardian". He engaged in a
polemical discussion, in writing, with William Patterson,
Negro spokesman for the CP, USA. Thus, a year or more
later, it might be said that the BPP has little rapport
with the CP, USA and its exemplar, the CP, USSR. The
Soviet Union has received many criticisms in the pages of
"The Black Panther" newspaper. 5

The New Left does maintain its relations with the
BPP, seeking Panther support in anti-war demonstrations,
and in such court cases as Los Siete de la Raza (six Chicanos
‘accused of killing a San Francisco policeman), the Soledad
brothers, (three Negroes accused of killing a prison guard),
and the Angela Davis, case, as examples. The Party seems
reluctant to get involved in any of these "causes", beyond
printing routine articles in its paper concerning these
activities,

PART IV. BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES

The Monthly Racial Calendar is posted on the bulletin
board in the Supervisor's office and all agents have been in-
structed to pay careful attention to the items listed thereon.
The calendar is also discussed in squad conferences and the
agents are briefed in order that they can take full advantage
of it.

With regard to the black extremist fugitives the
substantive cases are handled on the Criminal Fugitive Desk as
88 cases (Desk #2). There is close coordination between those
agents and agents handling racial matters and as an example of
this our technical informant coverage has established that the
following: black extremist fugitives have fled the United
States and are currently in Algiers:

INSPECTOR ARNOLD CY LARSON: Racial matters and racial
WLB/kah /jitene ~ informants are handled on
wi? t0758770 Desk #9 and supervised by
Special Agent David E. Todd.
The following comments, observations and instructions are
| : made on the basis of a review of the racial investigation
and informant files, an analysis of pertinent data furnished
by you, and discussion with supervisory and investigative
personnel handling racial matters:

RACIAL MATTERS - GENERAL
a SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION

The general overall picture of racial matters in
your division is as follows:

Nine hundred and seventy pending racial matters
(includes informants} handled by 23 Agents: 2 hasiec. black extremist
groups (the Black Panther Party [BPPj), Black Student Union
[BSU] and Nation of Islam [NOI] with 41 chapters or pads com-
prising a reported membership of 1,564 (1,198 are BSU); 9 funds
related to BPP traced; 51 institutions of higher education
with total enrollment of 272,970, number who are Negro and
other racial oriented extremists not identified; 6 ghettos
with a total population of 85,000; 2 black extremist
- newspapers with a circulation of 143, 000 covered by 14 Racial
Informants (RI), 10 RI-Probationary (RI Prob), 267, ghetto
informants, who are’ primarily listening posts, plus 6,Confi-
dential Racial Sources, and 2,.additional excellent sources,

7 namely SF 3215-R* and SE_3259=R*; only 4 informants in

leadership position.

Since the last inspection, 65 acts of violence
‘have occurred in the San Francisco Division which resulted
in 503 arrests, 103 police officers injured (civilian
injuries numerous, but unknown), and 11 deaths Targets
of violence included 9 institutions of learning, 9 Government
and military institutions, 3 utility and 15 commercial
establishments, 5 private residences, and 1 church, with total
‘estimated damage of $961,443. Included in the 65 acts of
violence were 50 bombing matters in, which _i- ormants.of the San.
Erangisce Office were unable to furnish informa
Cialor other, extremist
. Eh ots-9f.ViOLence.
Acts of violence “and figures concerning arrests and damages
include violence caused by both black and white New Left
militants.

Limited intelligence regarding stolen or stockpiling

" weapons of violence in files, however, a check with the

California State Bureau of Criminal Identification and
Investigation disclosed approximately 27,375 guns stolen
per annum in the area covered by the San Francisco Office.
The extent of racial extremists involved in these thefts is
unknown, however, numerous thefts establish potential source
for racial militants to obtain weapons of violence.

acts of counterintelligence, 4,fixed physical

/ along with 110 other physical surveillances,

“.were conducted in connection™with BPP activities. The

numerous acts of violence and extensive damage to persons
and property is indicative of the absolute need for quality
in-depth informant coverage on all militant extremist groups.

-., San Francisco is the most important office in connection
with the investigation of the BPP, whose National Headquarters
is located in two adjoining buildings in Oakland, California.
In addition, two other active chapters of the BPP are located
in San Francisco and Richmond, California. The San Francisco
Chapter has on its premises the National Distribution Office
of the BPP where the weekly newspaper, "The Black Panther," is
prepared. You have advised this paper has a circulation of
about 135,000 copies per week and is distributed throughout
the U.S. and abroad. As Office of Origin in the BPP investi-
gations, your office has the task of coordinating the
investigation of this extremely militant group for the whole
country, resulting in an extremely heavy paper load in the
administrative handling of this investigation.

: It is imperative that investigations concerning

this terroristic and militant organization be directed with
the utmost imagination and aggressiveness to insure that

the Bureau's responsibilities are fulfilled. The most
important goal for your office is to develop quality

“member informants in order that the Bureau will be in
“possession of advanced information on all pertinent contem-

plated acts of this :violence-prone group

informants, particularly in the upper echelon of the BPP
leadership, is apparent in order for the Bureau to fulfill
the grave responsibilities in this field.

It is to be noted that there are schools of higher
education located in each of the above-mentioned RAs.

In the past, there have been militant black student
groups at San Jose State College and San Jose City College,
the University of California at Berkeley, and San Francisco
State College. These groups have been influenced by or
have members who are extremists advocating violence-prone
activities. The RAs covering the varieus universities
throughout the San Francisco territory, as well as Headquarters
City Agents, must develop adequate sources and informants
in a position to report on black extremist involvement in
campus disorders. In this regard, make certain that campus
disorders are brought. to the Bureau's attention in accordance
with Bureau letter to all offices dated 1/31/69 captioned,

"Black Student Groups on College Campuses, Racial Matters".

The coverage in the above RAs regarding racial
matters points out the critical need for in-depth member
informant coverage in ail of the above areas to insure that
you can accurately assess violence potential in the
San Francisco Division, Although you have indicated that
several of the BSU chapters have not been prone to violence
or indicated any real militant activity, the potential remains

adequate coverage of these groups is imperative.

: You have advised that since the last inspection,

the territory covered by your office has experienced no

mass demonstrations, riots or confrontations of a racial

nature. You characterized this period as an organizational
- drive for minorities other than blacks. The number of acts

of violence which have occurred in your division would

indicate that Negro militants could certainly have

participated in some of these acts and your office must

make certain that your coverage of extremist groups, whether

37,
W148 Doctd:32999637 Page 286 0



organized or independent, receives an aggressive approach
in order that any participation by these individuals is
known to you prior to their participation in acts of violence.
‘Incidents which may not, on the surface, appear to be black
nationalist oriented could certainly provoke a reaction on
the part of extremists and lead to a civil disturbance in
ghetto areas. This is particularly true in situations
_+where: local police make an arrest in a ghetto area where
it does not take an incident of great magnitude to incite
a riot.

NOE

You have indicated that you have twc 2
informants covering the NOI Temple in San Francisco, as
well as the NOI Temple in Oakland. Although the NOI does
not advocate racial violence, at present they follow the
line of preaching hatred tc the white race. You should
remain alert to the need for excellent coverage of the NOL
and exert your efforts to improve your member coverage in
order to remain alert to all activities of this extremist

" group.

Counterintelligence

It is noteworthy that you have completed
counterintelligence projects since the last inspect
and currently have 3Zyunder submission to the Bureau for
approval. The rie at haber have included successfully

incumbent upon the personnel handling racial investigations
to be aware of the tremendous importance to recognize
opportunities to neutralize individual black extremists
or black extremist groups. The black extremists have
accelerated their terrorist tactics in recent months and
local police have borne tthe burden of their attacks. The
BPP, which is the vanguard of black extremism, has been
responsible for many of the attacks on police.

: INVESTIGATIONS OF BLACK EXTREMIST
ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS

All Special Agents handling racial matters
investigation should be familiar with instructions set
out in Bureau airtel to all offices dated 9/3/70, captioned
"attacks on Police, Extremist Activity". You should insure
that instructions concerning the opening of cases in
accordance with this airtel are followed.

You should make certain that personnel handling
raciai maticis are Completely familiar with the airtel directed
by the Bureau to all offices dated 10/12/70 captioned
"Black Panther Party, Racial Matters - Black Panther Party".

It is imperative that you are promptly instituting
investigation of all black extremist organizations, as well
as those individuals who are openly advocating violence,
“anarchy or insurrection. These investigations must be
directed to promptly ascertain the aims and objectives,
as well as the identities of the leaders and members. The
extent of each group's involvement in the black nationalist
movement must be determined promptly. You must be aggressive
and imaginative, and these investigations should be
pursued with the purpose of developing evidentiary material
t ‘with a goal of prosecution.

The ever-present need to be alert for information
concerning revolutionary extremists who may be planning
hijacking of airplanes or kidnapping of government officials
should be impressed on all personnel. Make certain the
| Bureau is promptly advised of all circumstances concerning
1 this more current and important area of our work. Agents
handling racial matters should be familiar with SAC Letter
70-18(C), which sets out guidelines for handling of bombings
or arsons which appear to have black extremist or New Left
connotations or modifications.



HW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 289 : :

Make certain that personnel assigned to racial
matter investigations are entirely familiar concerning the
fact that active investigation of gun law violations
should be conducted when these violations directly relate
to any investigation of which the Bureau has primary
investigative jurisdiction. This is particularly. pertinent
to investigations concerning the BPP, as well as other
terroristic, extremist and hate groups.

a Agents handling racial matters must be familiar
with SAC Letter 68-74 (D) dated 12/24/68, which instructs
that certain black extremists may be interviewed with SAC
authority. Further, you should continue to make certain that
where there are public rallies or demonstrations by extremists
that appropriate steps to record speeches made at these
gatherings by black extremists are being made. In this
regard, you should optain tape recordings of other speeches
made by extremists which are heard within your territory.

Agitator Index (AI)

if You have advised that you have 59 individuals
listed on the AI, of which 30 are affiliated with black

"extremist groups. Out of the 30, 15 are affiliated with

the BPP, including Charles R. Gar: -BPP Attorney. Penetrative
and aggressive investigation Of black nationalist militant
groups, as well as continued effective attention to white

hate groups, should result in the increase of individuals

. placed on the AI. You should make certain that personnel

recommending subjects for the AI also consider their
inclusion on the Security Index when they possess the
necessary criteria. 7

Racial Informants

As office of origin for the BPP, you 1 have a
eritical responsibility for developing informants in this
group who are knowledgeable concerning the overall activities
of the BPP throughout the United States and especially
knowledgeable eoncerning the activities of the BPP within
your division. You have made some progress in developing
informants in the BPP. However, this progress is 1i Limited
and, there is an urgent need for development of additional
quality informants in this organization. The immediate

. need for informants in the racial field was shown earlier
in this write-up where it was indicated that numerous acts
of violence have occurred in your division since the last
inspection in which you were unable to furnish information
as to the participants or whether or not the violence was
racial oriented. A particular weakness on the part of San
Francisco has been to develop informants in the upper echelon |
leadership of the BPP who can furnish information concerning ;
details of BPP finances and overall day-to-day activities
in the BPP offices. i

An example of San Francisco's weakness concerning

The increase in the number of racial informants

Whe difference between the Bureau records and the above
tabulation is explained due to the recent approval of new
racial informants and the closing of some ghetto informants.
The development of sources, particularly in the Resident
Agency territories where so many institutions of higher
education are locatéd, is an urgent need of the San Fran-~
cisco Division. The favorable growth in the number of ghetto
informants is noteworthy and necessary if the substantial
need to increase the number of RIs and-RI (probs) is met by
your office.

Each of your racial informants and your probationary
racial informants were rated and you have been advised
individually of these ratings, which are set forth as follows
in a tabulation for your ready reference.

Racial
Informants

The need for additional quality informant coverage
cannot be over~emphasized, particularly since you have
several areas that have experienced acts of violence where
there are no racial informants and racial informant probationaries,.
Although you have indicated ghetto informants have been
developed in some of these areas, you recognize that these
informants are primarily listening posts and have not been able
to furnish the quality intelligence information that is
needed for the Bureau to fulfill its responsibilities in
the racial field. You should insure that this matter of
developing quality racial informants is immediately brought
to the attention of all Resident Agents and efforts should he
made to reverse this undesirable situation.

During this inspection, you were advised separately
by "trend memoranda" concerning certain delinquencies in the
handling of racial informant files, It is most important
that Agents handling racial matter informants be completely
familiar: with Bureau instructions and that these instructions

- are followed explicitly. Make certain that all Agents are
giving their informants assignments and are alert for
evidentiary-type information, as well as intelligence-type
information. Due to the sensitivity of informant files,
you should continue to insure that these files are being
afforded complete security and that personnel having access
are mature individuals who can be expected to maintain
them under the most secure conditions.

With respect to your ghetto informants, insure
they are being given assignments, including attendance
at public meetings held by extremists, survey of
extremist book stores, verification of residence and
employment of AI and SI subjects living or working in
ghetto areas, identity of'extremists agitating in local
areas and information concerning youth gangs operating
in neighborhoods in such a fashion as to increase racial tension.

You should remain alert to the fact that ghetto
informants, in view of their unique positions in usually
high-crime areas and since black extremists are involved
in criminal activities, should also be obtaining criminal”
statistics in addition to racial-type information. In
this connection, San Francisco, only five months out of
the last 17 months, has furnished criminal statistics
achieved through RIs, which includes ghetto informants.

The field average in submitting criminal statistics from
racial informants is 8 out of 17. Your office should devise
a workable program wherein all criminal statistics achieved
through racial informants are properly recorded and racial
informants are given proper assignments.

i In addition, make certain that personnel handling
racial informants are uiiligzing the Black Extremist Fugitive

information concerning the composition of the newspaper,
as well as other pertinent details which are necessary
for our intelligence-gathering operations. In addition,
this is essential for evidence to be used in connection
with the possible forthcoming Smith Act prosecutions. Make
certain you continue to give your informants proper direction
so that full value can be obtained from their potential.

EwSd2ieR.Aprob) and §F.3056-R appear to have

potential for obtaining valuable racial information, as
well as evidentiary information, It is imperative that
these informants be utilized in such a way that their
potential value is consummated.

Stockpiling of Weapons and Ammunition

Your control file 157-3021 captioned "BPP ~
WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES", and 157-1171, "Stockpiling of
Arms and Ammunition", were reviewed and indicate that
these matters receive almost daily attention from SF 321 5=Ri se
It is imperative that all agents are constantly made aware
of the tremendous importance of these matters and the need
_for quality informants to provide information in this
field. During the current inspection, a timely example
of the need for informants in this particular area was
noted when the Oakland Police Department recovered a cache
of weapons and explosives which included 20 sticks of dynamite,
two dozen fire grenades, four grass grenades, two fragmentation
_grenades, three machine guns, including a .50 caliber military
weapon, and other guns and explosives. They were recovered
on 10/27/70, at the 55th Avenue Motel in Oakland.

Further, another timely example during the
éurrent inspection occurred when five individuals were
arrested on a military reservation in your territory while
doing target practice, including one using a rifle that was
determined to be stolen from the military. These individuals
were identified as former BPP members and associates. Again,
the demand and absolute necessity for quality in-depth 7
informants to apprise you of the individuals maintaining
weapons of violence is apparent. .

DocId: 3298963 age



: _ Hy

Make certain that all informants, both in the
vacial and criminal field, are properly alerted concerning
thefts of weapons of violence in an attempt to determine
if they are being stolen by individuals connected with
extremist activities. ‘

Observations
The BPP is noted for its terroristic nature
and philosophy of violence. Never in our history have
we been confronted with as critical a need for informant
coverage in such a violence~oriented organization. Bombings,
kidnappings, murder of police officers are all included in
the violence performed by these militant fanatics. The
ever spiraling crime rate, particularly in the ghetto,
has provided additional fuel for the militant and malcontent.
The racial situation is extremely serious and presents a
perplexing domestic prob] which eannot be over stressed,
The vital role of the Bureau's personnel in the racial field
is pressing and apparent, The Bureau is constantly being
judged by our ability to develop timely intelligence, to
identify the leaders, the direction of movement of all
radical groups and, where possible, to predict potential
trouble spots. To fulfill these grave responsibilities,
wwe must have an efficient wide-spread network of intelligent,
resourceful, aggressive, and quality informants and sources.
The informant inadequacies which have been brought to your
attention should be rectified as quickly as possible and
all personnel should continually be alerted to the need
| : for "member" informants so that all information velating
to potential violence will be proven to the Bureau's
attention.

‘1. All Agents of your office, regardless.of
their assignments, must be aware of the urgent need for the
development of an informant network which can provide accurate,
timely and advanced information concerning the black extremists.

3. You should immediately designate informants
on the peripheral of the BPP for priority attention inasmuch
as BPP membership may open up at any time and should have
some informants ready to move in. In this regard, current
’ BPP member informants should be designated for direction
to move into leadership positions should such positions
develop.

4, You should aggressively pursue the potential
for BPP informants through the infiltration of Panther
pads. An individual properly directed could possibly be
accepted in the pad which could not only provide coverage
but lead to a BPP leadership position.

5. Investigation of all pads and community
centers in your division should be followed closely to make
certain that the black extremists are identified and
investigated in accordance with Bureau instructions.

6. Make certain that all informants are alerted
to the theft of weapons of violence in order that your office
and the Bureau can be promptly advised of extremists involved
in potential acts of violence.

7. The necessity for complete informant coverage
is apparent and you should immediately instruct that where
black extremist groups, including the Black Student Union,
is located ‘in your territory without coverage that efforts
be made to correct this deficiency at once. In this regard,
the recent change in Bureau policy permitting interviews of
individuals under 21 years of age should be made known to
all personnel handling these matters in an attempt to increase
your informant coverage. :

8. You should continue your counterintelligence
program and be alert to any new schemes you might submit to
the Bureau for approval to use in this regard.

: 9, You should consider the placing of all black
extremist fugitives now handled on the criminal squads on
the desk of the Racial Matters Supervisor. Further in this
regard, you must make certain that all black extremists
who are subjects of substantive cases on criminal desks
are coordinated with the Racial Matters Desk.

10. You are further instructed to make the

Monthly Racial Calendar available to all Agents in the San
Francisco Office as well as the Black Fugitive Extremist List.

prior to making them and make appropriate notations on
their #3 cards. Supervisors thereafter, during file
reviews with Agents, check with them regarding those
contacts and spot-check informant files to insure after-
hour contacts were made and appropriately recorded.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT -

1. The overall objectives of the criminal informant program
are to develop high quality informants who are in a
position to furnish valuable information on a continuing
basis. .

Criminal desk supervisors participate in the program by
remaining alert to the necessity of having good informant
coverage in the criminal classifications which are covered
by their respective desks, The supervisor is also
required to approve any expenditure made to an informant

HW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 304 7



~7-

for information or services concerning| any case
handled on his desk and in this way willl be aware of the
progress of the program as it relates to their desk,

The supervisors also follow the Agents’ activities in
this regard on an individual basis to insure that they
are fully participating in the informant program,

ieee 2. The San Francisco.Office does have standards which
requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this
division should conform to and that is they should have
a minimum of four PCIs or one CI and two PCIs or two
CIs assigned at any one time. This, of course, is by
no means considered a maximum and many Agents
participate more fully in the program,

There are currently no first office agents assigned to
this division and when an Agent is transferred to this
division and assigned to criminal work he is expected
to show some progress by the end of sixty days and
within one year he is expected ta be in compliance
with the above standards. :

Crime on Government Reservations, Crime on the High Seas,
Probation and Parole Violators, Bond Default Pugitives, and
Crime Aboard Aircraft and Air Piracy.

It is noted there are several major - military

Regarding the Government reservations, it is noted
that specific liaison assignments have been made in regard
,to these but inasmuch as persons normally contacted on these
bases are Government employees contacted on an official
basis, they are not considered appropriate for development
as CIs and are bound to furnish information as part of
their duties. It is noted, however, that the Hunters -Point
Naval Shipyard is in a predominantly Negro area and two
PRIs, 170-845 and 170-241, are under development at that
location by SAs assigned to this squad.

Regarding the air piracy and crime aboard aircraft

Selective Service matters and have been instructed to develop
informants that will be of assistance in this classification.

It is also pointed out that this desk has numerous
subjects that fall in the radical left and Black militant
category. Anytime these subjects, when interviewed, appear
to be cooperative in any degree their names and addresses
are furnished to the appropriate desk for consideration as
development to an informant.

Members of this squad continually endeavor to
develop informants in Black neighborhoods, homosexual hang-
outs, and cheap hotel areas where most fugitive Selective

MONTEREY RA

The Monterey RA covers a territory that is rural

in nature and its main industry is touvism and agriculture.
There are four agents assigned to the Monterey RA which
handle primarily criminal classifications and they are SAs
FRANK W. MITCHELL, WARREN A. COOK, MAX H. FISCHER and LESLIE

Criminal matters in the Santa Rosa RA are handled
by SAs WILLARD E. BASEMAN and DOUGLAS R. AHLSTROM.

a The Santa Rosa RA covers three rural counties of
Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake, comprising some 7000 square
miles in area. The bulk of criminal activity is located in
and around the headquarter city of Santa Rosa, California
(Sonoma County). Informant coverage has been established
in the legalized cardrooms and night clubs in this area,

Coverage in the counties of Mendocino and Lake is
limited to the close personal relationship with deputy
sheriffs that cover the remote areas of these counties, which
principal industries: are logging and ranching.

! There are no principal targets for informant
development, such as shipping companies, railroads, airports,
or large industries. Coverage has been established in
gambling, 137-3976 and 137-4486. In night clubs, coverage
has been established with females, 137-5819 and 137-5818,
both of whom are furnishing quality information and will be
converted as CIs.

In deserter and Selective Service matters, hippie
coverage is maintained in Guerneville, California (Sonoma
County) through 137-5462. This latter town is largely a
summer resort town for the area, but does have a hippie
population in the winter months as well. Also, in the
Indian and Mexican deserter fugitive matters, 137-1412
gives coverage to the skid row section of Santa Rosa,
California.

WALNUT CREEK RA

“ criminal investigations in the Walnut Creek RA are
handled by SAs RUDOLPH H. MANCINI and FRANKLIN S. BURROUGHS.

This RA covers a territory which consists of
several large “bedroom" communities and a large section that
is rural in nature.

The only problem high crime rate area in the
i territory is-the City of Pittsburg, which is a Negro ghetto-
type area and specific efforts have been made to develop
f informant coverage in this area. The following informants
have been developed and furnish general criminal and racial
; danformation for the Pittsburg area:

137-674
137-5079

In addition, the RA handles four other informants
and they are: . .

agents are expected to submit a replacement at the
earliest possible date.

of the informant program as it concerns them. Also,
if there is any particular problem concerning the
handling of a particular informant, a supervisor is
expected to assist and give guidance to the agent

, handling this particular informant. Supervisors are
also regularly reminded of the importance of the
informant program at supervisors! conferences and follow
their individual agents to insure that they are fully
participating.

Supervisors in this office are not required to approve
either closing or opening memoranda on informant files.
No record is kept of productivity ofinformants by

through the monthly statistical letter submitted on
informant production inasmuch as each haeetatinn is

and their responsibility to participate in it at each
biweekly squad conference.

7. ‘Informant statistics are not kept by RA or road trip

if it were necessary to obtain it by review of the
particular informant files that are providing coverage

weaknesses are noted. However, efforts are made on a
continuing basis to try to improve coverage in all
areas.

8. It is felt that informant coverage at Headquarters City
is adequate at this time, but as indicated innumber
seven above, a continuing effort is made to _improve this
coverage.

Regarding the coverage provided by each criminal desk,
it is noted that as of October 12, 1970, the following
CIs and PCIs are being handled off the respective desks:

9, Administrative devices used to make certain agents are
making maximum contributions to the criminal informant
program are that the agents are followed on an individual
basis through file reviews and supervisor conferences to
insure they are meeting the criteria as set forth in
question number two above. The criminal informant files
are also specifically reviewed on a semi-annually basis

7 at the time the semi-annual LiMs are submitted to the

| Bureau. It is also noted files are checked at the time
they are posted on a continuing basis.

10. Informant files are reviewed at the end of the first
year they have been opened on an individual basis and
if they have been unproductive the agent is advised to
close the case and replace the PCI with anew one.

If the PCI has been productive the agent, handling him
is advised to convert him to a criminal informant. If
it is a questionable matter it is discussed with the
agent handling the PCI on an individual basis and a
decision is reached in this matter inasmuch as the
agent is in a bettex position to make the judgement as
to the potential of this particular Pcl.

All agents in the San Francisco Division are aware of
the racial and ghetto informant program through
participation. If an agent has a case that he feels
warrants contacting of ghetto informants he will
dictate a memorandum setting forth specifically that
they should be contacted by the particular agents
handling them.

No actual record is kept of how much use is made of

the geographical criminal informant index. However, it
has proved to be a valuable tcol in determining who

the logical informants are to contact in any given
situation. This has saved many investigative hours by
making easily available to each agent the particular
type of informant coverage he might need.

ADDENDUM = = //7 LO : ‘

INSPECTOR ARNOLD Cc. LARSON
10/27/70 ui :

/
pee of
All criminal informant (CI) files and a representative
number of potential criminal informant (PCI) files were reviewed
during this inspection. Following review, a memorandum

disclosing the rating afforded in each file has been forwarded
to you for inclusion in the respective file.

Your office is currently operating 145 CIs as
compared to 141 CIs being operated at the time of the last
inspection. There is also an increase in the number of PCIs
under development at this time to 271 as opposed to 250 under
development dusing the last inepection, These figures do not
include Top Echelon informants or targets for development
which are commented on separately under the Criminal Intelligence
Program. This represents a slight increase in the number of
CIs and a more substantial increase in the number of PCIs
under development. However, there is a slight decrease in
two large metropolitan areas, namely, San Francisco and Oakland,

, which though slight represents a static situation as to

: . increasing coverage in these areas. The Oakland Resident

Agency has also recorded a decrease in the number of PCIs
under development. In analyzing the coverage in the resident

_ agencies, it was noted that Monterey, Richmond and San Jose
have the same coverage from CIs as during the last inspection
although Monterey and San Jose have shown a substantial
increase in the number of PCIs being handled. PCIs under
development in Salinas and San Rafael are down somewhat,
although this too in part is off-set by the increase in the
number of CIs being operated. In view of the Bureau's
increased responsibilities, it is absolutely essential that
a strong criminal informant program be maintained and in
fact expanded if the Bureau is to meet these increased
responsibilities.

inspection and the following ratings were given to the CIs

137-213 (Bufile 137-3071). Because SF 3308-C furnishes
information principally as a result of his employment in
the U.S. Army, Personnel Center, Oakland, California Army
Base, this informant should be discontinued as a.CI and
converted to a Confidential Source. SF 2290-C was recently
reopened on the basis of having provided a service to
Department of Justice attorneys and the Bureau but has furnished
no criminal information for an extended period of time and
had been in a closed status since 3/10/69. This informant
should also be discontinued as a CI and considered as a
Confidential Source. You should appropriately advise the
Bureau that this action has been taken.

The following informants have been rated Fair and
they should be given specific assignments for a period of
90 days in an attempt to improve their productivity. At
the end of that period of time you should advise the Bureau
of reasons for continuing them as informants or that they
are being discontinued.

AGENT PARTICIPATION

You have indicated Special Agents JAMES P. MALOY,
CARLTON H. ‘WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY have spent 50% or
more of their time on criminal type investigative matters
during thepast year but do not currently have assigned a
qualified CI personally developed by them. Further comment
is being set forth later in this addendum concerning eee
Agents.

PAYMENTS

A review of payments indicates that your office
paid an average of $1,473.98 a month to informants during
the period immediately preceding the last inspection. For
the period immediately preceding this inspection, an average
of $1,643.10 was paid to informants each month. A spot
check of payments made to CIs and PCIs indicated value was
being received for the money paid. You should insure that
your personnel are alert to the use of monetary payments to
enlist the fur x coope; on of informants by compensating
them for expenses incurred in pursuit of information for
this Bureau and as compensation for their effort on the
Bureau's behalf. You should continue to closely evaluate
ar anil payments to insure that value is received for money
paid.

* ACCOMPLISHMENTS

According to Bureau records your office shows
increases in 4 of the 8 statistical accomplishments
attributable to informants and it is noted that these
increases have occurred in matters concerned directly with FBI
investigations.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

You have indicated a rather extensive involvement
of supervisory personnel in directing informant development to
those areas of responsibility coming within the scope of
their respective desks. Referring to Government reservations
and military installations, you indicated you do not
consider Government employees appropriate for development as
CIs as they are bound to furnish information as part of
their duties. Your attention is specifically directed to

175,

i Page 324 iueme



Section 108, I-12, Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, which
states informants should be developed on Government
reservations and military installations when warranted. In
view of the large installations located within your territory,
it is suggested you identify particular areas of these
installations wherein informant coverage would be logical

and productive and give consideration to pinpointing such areas
for development.

You have also indicated that Supervisors approve
payments to informants and in this way are also aware of the
productivity of the informant program. However, it is noted
that approval of payments provides a rather limited
assessment of the productivity of informants and points out
the need for a continuing evaluation of respective coverage.
Supervisors must constantly be alert to identify specific
areas in which informant coverage would be logical and
productive.

- OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

You should give consideration to the development
of informants on Government reservations and military
_ ‘installations as suggested by the Manual of Instructions.

In a number of instances, it was noted there was
no follow-up on incomplete information furnished by informants.
In such instances, the informant was not recontacted any
sooner than required by the 30 day contact rule, which would
indicate a lack of direction of the informant to further
develop information of interest. The need to give informants
direction to develop information to the point it can be
considered useful and valuable should be brought to the
attention of all appropriate investigative personnel.

There were few instances noted during review of

the CI files wherein FD-302's had been utilized in recording
informant information. It is recognized that much information
regarding fugitives and possible suspects does not require



e o °
7

, \
such recording but in view of the recent passage of Senate
Bill 30 which will greatly expand the opportunity to utilize
informant information, you should make certain all personnel
are aware of those instances in which informant information
should be recorded on an FD-302 and the proper method for so
recording it.

!

Numerous areas have been identified in your
territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie
elements, many with a high incidence of crime. To provide
a better over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and
the ‘heavily populated East Bay area and to facilitate a more
convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to
this information, you should consider preparing a large wall
map of the San Francisco - East Bay area and placing it ina
central secure position in the office. In addition to criminal
informants, you should include the location in which racial
and ghetto informants will logically be able to furnish
information and you should identify the location of all these
informants on the map with an appropriate locator reference
to an index showing the agent to whom the informant is
assigned and the coverage which informant can be expected to
provide.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED

Explanations are requested from SA's JAMES P. MALOY,
CARLTON H. WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY as to why they have
“not developed a qualified criminal informant during the past
year.

number of CI'S since the last inspection and have increased
the number of PCI'S since the last inspection. We have also
increased our payments to informants and no instances have
been found where we did not get value received from these
payments to informants. We have achieved excellent statistics
from them as indicated by the fact that at the close of the
last fiscal year we were ahead in all eight categories of
informant accomplishments. This is our continuing goal and
we will make every effort to surpass these accomplishments
in the coming months. The observations, instructions and
suggestions of the Inspector will be immediately complied
with and this program will continue to receive close super-

‘ presently handling 4 PCI's. One PCI,
STEVE VINSON (137-5565) can be qualified as a CI_as soon as
additional background information is obtained. I will
immediately develop this background information and he will

5565) furnished information on which investigating Agents
located and interviewed subject (Mosely). In 25-7475 PCI
Steve Vinson (137-5565) furnished information on which
investigating Agents located the subject (Malagone). PCI
Vinson is ina position to furnish information on Deserters,
SSA fugitives, hippies and narcotics. In 25-73123 PCI

Jay Wilson (137-5790) furnished information re fugitive
Jonathan Pitts. In 25-72710 PCI Dewey A. Parker (137-5566)

H 10/28/70. assigned to criminal work I have

approved Criminal Informants. In the past year since I
| - last had an approved Criminal Informant I have handled
several PCIs including one who previously was the prime
: faetor in the apprehension of a Bureau fugitive wanted
: for the murder of a police officer. This PCI has since
' furnished information of value which was relayed to the
local police in a burglary case. He has been given the
assignment to develop further information concerning local
suspects in the handling of stolen merchandise from this
and other burglaries.

In the past year I have been unable
to devote a great deal of time to the development of this
and other PCIs due to having been utilized as Relief
Supervisor in the absence of the regular supervisor and
because of the time necessary. to prepare and present lectures
at police schools on legal matters. :

I am aware of the importance of the
Criminal Informant Program and will continue efforts to
develop a qualified Criminal Informant and expect to
qualify the above-mentioned PCI in the very near future.

SA CARLTON H. WOLRFARTH: I am extremely aware| of the need to
10/28/70 ° . develop CIs and have had a total of
CHW 3 ekk . nine PCIs in San Francisco during the
time I have been in San Francisco.

I arrived in the San Francisco Division,
7/13/69, on transfer from the Chicago Division. It is to be noted
that I developed CG 7215C in 1967. This informant had either
worked for or was close to the top men of organized crime in Chicago,
Miami and New Orleans, At one time, through a:court order, this
informant was wired with a microphone and tape recorder so
information could be obtained in an Obstruction of Justice case.
I had at least one other informant while I was handling the
above informant, and handled both until leaving Chicago.

The potential of the four PCIs which I
opened on 8/2),/70 and the one which I opened 10/19/70 appears
promising and it is anticipated that at least one will develop
into a CI in the near future, 7

: My assignments in Sen francisco hive
been mainly ITSP - FBW investigations which are complicated and
involve reviewing records and interviows with banks, brokerage
house and other business officials. TI had one excellent

supervisory personnel to surpass the prior year's accomplish-
ments in all four categories of convictions; fines, savings,
and recoveries; fugitives apprehended; and automobiles
recovered,

The Bureau by letter dated 7/13/70 called this
to your attention and pointed out that each SAC must
exhibit aggressive sound leadership in the future. It
pointed out that failure to meet this challenge reflects
most unfavorably upon the SAC's ability as an administrator
and an FBI official. The SAC was instructed to take
immediate steps to analyze the investigative and supervisory
programs and take corrective action where necessary.

As will be noted for the first three months of
the current fiscal year (FY), your convictions are deficient
by 37% as are your fines, savings, and recoveries. This
is a continuation of a most undesirable trend.

In analyzing the lack of convictions, it was
noted that you had a decline in the Theft From Interstate
Shipment classification of 39% in fiscal year .1970, and
a continuation of this downward trend during the first
three months of the current FY. In the Selective Service
category during the first three months of FY 1971 you
obtained only 9 convictions as compared with 21 in the
prior year for a decline of 57%. This number of convictions
seems very low when considering the fact that as of 9/30/70
you had pending in this office 2257 cases in this category.

During first three months of current FY there has
been a decline of ‘878 in the ITSHY category (1 vs 8) and
a decline of 86% in the Theft of Government Property classi~
fication (1 vs 7). In addition, no convictions were obtained
as of 9/30/70 in the Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Property category and you had pending in the office 307
cases.

Your accomplishments seem very low for your investment

It was noted that as of 10/1/70 there were no
vacancies with respect to Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys,
or Assistant U. S. Attorneys, which might reflect unfavorably
upon your statistical picture. You advised the Bureau
that you had 352 subjects under indictment and several
hundred Selective Service cases pending prosecution which
indicates you may have the potential for correcting this
situation before the end of the year.

suprfiltoress: Concerning the decline of Selective Service
10/28/76 statistical accomplishments for the first
three months of 70-71 as compared to 638-70,

it will be noted that in an endeavor to expedite these
matters through the U.S. District Courts, a conference was
held on February 26, 1970, with the U.S. Attorney for the
Northern District of California at San Francisco, Mr. James L.
Browning, representatives of the California State Selective
Service System, the local Selective Service System and
three members of the U.S. Department of Justice. Continual
weekly contacts are made with the U.S. Attorney to expedite
these matters and again on July 10, 1970, a conference was
held which included the U.S. Attorney, San Francisco, the
Director of the California State Selective Service System
and the Director of the National Selective Service System,
My. Cuytis Tarr, along with attorneys for the national
Selective Service System and representatives of the U.S.
Department of Justice. These matters are followed closely

aa with a minimum of two contacts a week being made with the
U.S. Attorney. It will be noted that many of these matters
have been postponed as many as six to eight times in U.S.
District Court and several conferences have been had with
former Chief U.S. District Court Judge George B. Harris, and
on 10/15/70 U.S. Attorney James L. Browning discussed these
matters with the new Chief U.S. District Court Judge of San
Francisco, Oliver B. Carter. Every effort has been made
through sources available to this office to expedite these
matters in U.S. District Court. It will be noted that as of
10/14/70 the San Francisco Office had 414 outstanding
.indictments. 57 of these are fugitives that are out of the
country and since that date, on October 14, 15 and 21, 1970,
an additional 39 indictments have been obtained giving a total
of 453 outstanding indictments. The total Selective Service
matters presently awaiting Federal Grand Jury action is 749.
The decline in statistics in the Selective Service category-is
due to the lack of action on the part of the U.S. District
Court Judges due to the lack of enthusiasm and the coddling
of these cases by the U.S. District Court Judges. It will
be noted that several of these cases have been under submission
to U.S. District Court Judge CARTER for over one year, I will
continue close aggressive liaison with the U.S. Attorney and
U.S. District Courts and endeavor to increase the statistical
accomplishments in this category.

10/28/70 av been a decline of 87% in ITSMV
classification (1 vs. 8) anda
decline of 86% in the TGP classification (1 vs. 7). These
two classifications are supervised by me on Desk 3 of this

office.

The following tabulations are set forth below which
set out the convictions of this desk from 7/1/70 to 10/16/70,

wt One of the main reasons for reduction in convictions

. in the 26 classification this year over last year is the
Departmental guidelines pertaining to ITSMV matters. The
combination of the 52-70 convictions this year is 18, as
compared with 13 last year. I realize that the 26 and 52
convictions independently are below last year, but every
effort is being made to achieve and thereafter exceed the
goal set during the preceding year.

I constantly stress to those Agents in Headquarters
and the Resident Agencies which cover sources of 52 matters,
government reservations, transport facilities (shipment of
government property), to be constantly alert to obtain those
matters which should be investigated by the FBI.

In addition, I would like to point out that I will
continue to take all necessary steps to exceed this year in
the statistical accomplishments of this squad over the
previous year. :

I would like to point out that I have taken the
necessary steps and will continue to do so in compliance with
Bureau instructions to streamline the ITSMV matters and handle
only those that are fully justified and at the same time :
pursue those that are justified towards convictions.

ITSP Matters {

There was a gain in ITSP matters é6f one conviction
in fiscal year 1970 (seven) over fiscal year 1969 (six).

On 9/24/70, the San Francisco Office obtained one
conviction in the ITSP field (BUfile 87-111262, SFfile 87-31516).
We have every reason to believe therewill be a large per-
centage increase in statistical accomplishments in the ITSP
field for fiscal year 1971. We have a large amount of quality
eases offering an excellent potential for statistical accomplish-
ments. At the present time we have four individuals indicted
in the 87- category. Additionally, we have eleven other
subjects wherein we believe indictments will be obtained.

Two of thesematters have already been discussed with the USA,
who has indicated he will seek indictments. Additionally,
we have two 87- cases awaiting pleas under Rule 20 in other
field offices.

In view of the above, we anticipate that we will
have at least seventeen convictions in the 87- field by the
end of the fiscal year 1971, plus any other cases that might
be reported to us. There is every reason to believe in 1971
that we will not only equal but considerably exceed the
statistical accomplishments that we obtained in 1970. As
noted above, we expect to at least double the amount of
convictions obtained last year.

: Mention siould be made here to accurately present
the accomplishments of the squad in this category that as a
result of information obtained and developed by one of the
-agents, the Las Vegas Office was able to recover $650,000

.of Aveo thrift certificates (BUfile 87-108171, SFfile 87-30355).

7 TPIS Matters

| The decline in convictions in this category has been

;a matter of great concern, and every effort is being made to
.veverse this situation. The Bureau has been kept advised in
‘detail of this situation. This decline in convictions during
. fiscal year 1970 was a direct result of a change of policy

fan the USA's office concerning the prosecution of these cases.
The high volume of convictions obtained by the San Francisco

* Office in past years was attributable to the policy of taking

NW_55148__DocTd: 32989637 Page 336



petty offenders before the USC on the day that they were ap~
prehended’ and on that same day they would usually be sentenced
after a guilty plea. The USA's office noted in a letter dated
7/11/69 that a review by their office of cases presented to
, them in past years disclosed that almost none of the offenses
involved TFIS thefts where the value of the goods exceeded

$100 and that over 95 per cent of the cases referred to the
USA by the FBI had been handled by the USC under the Assimilative
Crimes Act. The USA's office has recently had anferences

with the San Francisco PD and the San Francisco District
Attorney and has informed them of their policy not to prosecute
minor thefts of cases involving less than $100 and has urged
the San Francisco PD and District Attorney ina accept and

handle these cases. :

At the time of the current inspection, the San
Francisco Office has obtained eleven convictions compared to
twelve convictions obtained last year at this time. Although
we are down one conviction oc ed to last year at this.
time, there is every reason to believe that we will exceed
last year's accomplishments, as we have some good cases
pending prosecution.

As noted above, the type of case we are handling
now as compared to those in the past, is one that is more
likely to produce a high recovery value,-and it should be
noted that the amount recovered to date during the current
fiscal year is $159,000, as compared to $6,000 last year.

I have personally discussed the prosecution of
TFIS cases with USA JAMES BROWNING, as well as several of
his assistants, pointing out the need for prompt indictment
and prosecution. The Bureau is aware, of course, of the
change in personnel of the USA's office, including the USA.
Another reason for the fact that we have not exceeded last
year's number of convictions is the cases currently pending
prosecution have been assigned and re-assigned several times
to different AUSAs, as there has been a. large turnover in
their staff. There are currently three new attorneys which
handle the majority of these prosecutions, none who have
been in office more than several months, and as the files will
reflect in those cases offering a potential for prosecution,
they have stated they have not as yet had an opportunity to
review the case, since it had just been recently assigned to
them. USA BROWNING has advised that he is making every :
effort to obtain faster indictments and subsequent prosecution

89: Page 337


of these cases, and he hopes with additional experience on
his part and on the part of his staff that cases will be
handled in a more expeditious manner.

“Additionally, I have personally called upon local
businessmen in the transporation industry whoiare a source
of these cases, as well as having had frequent discussions
with local police and District Attorney LOWELL JENSEN of
Alameda County and Chief Criminal Deputy H.F. CLIFFORD
of San Francisco County, in order to apprise them of the
Bureau's policy and obtain more cooperation in these matters.

As noted above, we are only one conviction behind
our record of last year at this time and most definitely
feel that we will exceed our number of convictions obtained
in fiscal 1970. I base this optimistic forecast on the fact
that the tremendous expenditure of Squadi# agent time last
year in connection with civil rights cases will not be
duplicated in fiscal 1971 and that this tremendous amount of
investigative time can be directed toward securing additional
statistical accomplishments in those classifications handled
by Squad #5.

General Observations

In order to accurately present an over-all picture
of the accomplishments of Squad #5, it should be noted that in
fiscal year 1970 nine convictions were obtained in the 43-
classification against four for the previous-fiscal year,
and we have obtained one so far this fiscal year.

Additionally, much of the efforts of this squad have
been directed towards the handling of the civil rights cases
which grew out of the People's Park riots in Berkeley in 1969.
Currently indicted are twelve Alameda County sheriff deputies
and former deputies. It is estimated approximately 800 to 1000
interviews have been conducted by the sauad in. connection
with the civil rights cases, all of which have had very short
period deadlines. .The USA has just commended this office by
letter dated 10/21/70 for the extremely able investigative
efforts and other assistance given to the USA's office. These
trials are currently scheduled. One took place in October;
another is scheduled for 11/2 and the tremendous amount of time
and attention give to these civil rights cases has taken
that investigative time away from other classifications
that might be more productive statistically. ~

Concerning the fact that the office is currently
deficient under the category fines, savings and recoveries,

/87,

HW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 338



it should be pointed out herethat a report has been submitted
to the Bureau wherein a recovery value of sixty million
dollars was claimed, which added to the fines, savings and
recoveries, will put the office well ahead of last year in
this category. (BUfile 44-23710, SFfile 44-842). \

San Francisco Office is reported

in Section 4-M-1’of the work papers of this inspection.

The following observations and comments regarding bank

robbery matters are based upon a review of all pending origin

Inspector A!

‘eases, a selection of closed and auxiliary office cases,

related control files, discussions with appropriate personnel
assigned to these cases, and a review of the techniques and
procedures used by this office.

SOLUTIONS

According to Bureau records the San Francisco
Office from July 1, 1968, through September 30, 1970, had
a total of 356 violations of the Federal Bank Robbery Statute
consisting of 311 robberies, 23 burglaries, and 22 larcenies.

Of these viPlations 227 robberies, 13 burglaries,
and 14 lareenies for a total of 254 are solved. During this

. same period, 31 additional violations of the Statute which

occurred prior to 7/1/68 were also solved.

As of 9/30/70, there are 77 robberies, 3 burglaries,
and 5 larcenies pending unsolved in the San Francisco
Office. Of these, 8 robberies and one larceny occurred
prior to 7/1/68. A comparative tabulation of violations
and solutions which occurred during the period of the last
inspection and current inspection are set out below:

Current Inspection Period;
July 2, 1969 to October, 1970

142 of 190 (75%)

HW 55148" ‘ pocta: 32989637 Page 340 a a. f



As reflected in the tabulation above, your

| overall solution rate of bank robbery matters since last
inspection has increased 19% which is a very favorable

‘trend. This solution rate is indicative of the conscientious
effort made by Agents of the San Francisco Office in this
most important area of the Bureau's responsibilities. You
should insure that all investigative and supervisory personnel
continue this effort to effect solutions in these cases.

The 86 unsolved cases in the San Francisco
Office will require continuous aggressive, imaginative
effort inasmuch as experience has shown that as time passes
the solution rate in bank robbery and bank larceny cases
drops drastically.

It is noted all convictions obtained by the
San Francisco Office for bank robbery violations have been
handled in the U.S. District Court and it is noteworthy
that you have perfected liaison to the point where these
matters are being handled exclusively by the Federal government.

‘The differences between your figures and Bureau
figures -is accounted for since Bureau figures are as of
September 30, 1970, and the San Francisco Office figures

,7are as of October 16, 1970.

Those areas requiring further attention in bank
robbery matters are those consisting of the greatest areas
of population; that is, Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, and
Headquarters. In the case of Berkeley, it is suggested that
greater efforts be made to obtain informants connected with
the New Left element inasmuch as this area*has the greatest
student population in the San Francisco Bay Area and members
of the SDS and other revolutionary groups have indicated a
propensity for violence including bank robbery. |

Although the percentage of delinquencies in
any classification is only one measure of the attention
being given cases in that category, the above; tabulation
indicates the comparative delinquency in the bank robbery

_. matters with the overall office delinquency and the
delinquencies in criminal matters.

It is noted that delinquencies in 91 matters
has been below the office generally in 10 out of the past
15 months. The 6.2 delinquency and 5.3 delinquency shown
in the chart above appears to be excessive for those months
and all efforts should be made to insure that this type
of delinquency does not recur in 91 matters. In this
all important category delinquency should be held at an
absolute minimum,

INFORMANTS

At the beginning of the current inspection there
were 17 approved CIs opened and assigned to the Agents on
the Bank Robbery Squad in the San Francisco Office. These
=17 informants have been separately rated in the informant
section of the inspection report (shown in Section 4-H).
The ratings are as follows:

Excellent 2
Very Good 2
Good 8
Fair °3
Poor 1

One informant is not being rated in view of
insufficient data to rate and it appears this informant
will be placed in the nature of a source as a result of
this inspection. You should give serious consideration
to giving the informants rated good or fair specific
assignments so that they may become more productive in
the future.

As can be seen from the above tabulation the
informant program handled by the Agents on the Bank
Robbery Squad is in need of improvement. Agents working
on this squad should be constantly selecting new individuals
for consideration under the informant program and should be

/G¢.

DocId:32989637 Page 343



i : “Gu

\ aware of the possibility of developing quality informants
from the Bank Robbery Suspect Program. Agents handling
bank robbery matters should continue to be leaders within

« the office in this particular category.

The San Francisco Office has a total of 268

‘ghetto informants, 14 racial informants, and 8 probationary
racial informants. This is an excellent pool for obtaining
quality bank robbery information and it should be fully
utilized by your office. You should insure that dissemination
is promptly made for timely contacts of these sources when
the facts of a bank robbery are clear so that full advantage

! can be made of any information they may have while the facts
are still fresh in the mind of those individuals that are
contacted.

“BANK RORBERY SUSPECTS

The Bureau has advised all offices of the need
to develop quality informants among known and suspected
armed robbers and burglars and thieves. The Bank Robbery
Suspect Program has been most/effective in developing informants
from among this element. Your efforts should be directed
-towards developing background information on individuals
previously convicted for bank robberies and bank burglaries
as well as armed robberies.

: You should increase your efforts through

: continuous intensive coverage of known robbers to
develop suspects or informants especially in view of the
cosmopolitan area of San Francisco and the closeness to the
Los Angeles and Las Vegas criminal elements.

In regard to your suspect program you should
accummulate all pogsible data concerning their background
and ebtain photographs of these individuals as soon as possible
in order that they could be added to your Bank Robbery
Album and utilized during your investigation of bank robberies
in your territory. , “

ADMINISTRATIVE HANDLING

Review of your files discloses that in general
bank robbery cases and related matters are receiving the
attention they deserve and are generally well administered.

Procedures being followed by the San Francisco Office
conform to the Bureau rules and regulations in regard

to the prompt notification of the Bureau of a bank robbery
violation and prompt submission of initial reports within
30 days. However, it is noted in several instances in
which notes have been used these notes after being obtained
have not been promptly submitted to the FBI Laboratory.

The need for obtaining and promptly submitting these notes
should be brought to the attention of all the Agents on the
Bank Robbery Squad. The obtaining of these notes and the
prompt submission is necessary in both those cases in which
the Subject is unknown as well as those in which the Subject —
has been identified.

In view of the number of bank robberies that
have occurred throughout the San Francisco territory
newspapers apparently have shown a reluctance to publicize
photographs of Subjects obtained from surveillance cameras
during the commission of the robberies. Efforts should be
made to institute a program in which newspapers can be induced
to publish these photographs throughout the territory
covered by the San Francisco Office shortly after the commission
of a robbery in which a good likeness of the Subject has
been obtained. :

EVIDENCE

SAC Letter 69-32, dated June 10, 1968, instructs
that the note used by a bank robber, latent impressions
found at the scene, and similar physical evidence should
be submitted to the Bureau on the day of the violation or

“as soon thereafter as possible. If local authorities have
the original note, copies should be promptly and forwarded
in accordance with existing procedures. In the absence of
unusual circumstances the initial 30 day report in bank
robbery cases should contain results of the Laboratory
and Identification Division examinations.

In 91-9460 a bank robbery was committed on
10/9/70, and although the Subject was apprehended he had
left a note and this note has not yet been submitted to the
FBI Laboratory.

In 91-9446 a bank robbery occurred on 10/5/70,
and indications are that the suspect involved in this case
may possibly have been involved in three other, bank robberies.
This robbery was another in which a note was used and there
is no indication in this file that this note has yet
‘been submitted to the Bureau. Other cases in which there
were not timely submissions of latent prints and/or demand
notes were noted in your files 91-9439, 91-9382, 91-9410,
91-9395. It is essential that personnel of your office
fully comply with existing Bureau procedures relative to the
prompt submission of evidence in bank robbery matters. In
the above instances you:-are instructed to immediately submit
demand notes or copies thereof to the Bureau for appropriate
examination.

i NCIC

In 91~9410 and 31-9446 the Unknown Subjects
obtained bait money, however, there is no indication that
the serial numbers of the bait money have been entered
into NCIC, You should insure that bait money in bank

‘ pobberies is entered into NCIC immediately.

SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

In approximately 75 to 80% of the bank robberies
in which a photograph was obtained it was of material
assistance in solving the case. In addition, where Subject
vhas been identified by other means, the photograph was
available as corroborative evidence.

On the other hand, if a bank camera does not
photograph the Subject or produces a blurred result because
of poor lighting it is an expense to the bank and of no
practical use toward the solution of the case.

In 91-3460 a surveillance camera had been
installed by the bank, however, it was not activated during
the commission of the robbery. However, in this case the
Subject was subsequently apprehended. You should insure
that during clinics conducted by your office, banks are
instructed to insure cameras are in proper working condition,
properly serviced and bank employees are aware of the value
of activating the cameras at the proper time.

Docld:32989637 Page 346 19 7.



BANK ROBBERY CLINICS

It is noted that the San Francisco Office is
conducting frequent Bank Robbery Clinics throughout the
division to give banking institutions instructions
concerning their role in bank robbery investigations
and to create a continued interest among bank officials
to adopt a continuing training program for their employees.
It is recommended that you continue to give clinics of this
type throughout your territory and stress the need for
bank officials to become security conscious in connection
with their banking procedures and physical plants.

It is noted as a result of these clinics and
contacts with the Bank cf America which has over 960 branches
has produced an excellent training film which is shown
periodically to all new personnel. Other banks are following
this procedure and this should assist substantially in
obtaining good descriptive data of suspects as well as
reducing the incidents of bank robberies in your division.

As a result of the passing of the Bank Protection
Act of 1968 most of the banks throughout your area have
installed or are in the process of installing cameras
in. most of their branches. Through the wider use of
bank surveillance photographs shortly after the commission
of a robbery it should lead ‘to the identification of
more suspects.

It is noteworthy in an attempt to minimize the
number of bank robberies occurring in the San Francisco
Bay Area the City of San Francisco has adopted a plan of
encouraging the hiring of law enforcement officers as
tellers during their off hours during which time they are
armed. A review of your files indicates that over the
past year and a half this has proved very successful in
apprehending bank robbers, bad check passers, and individuals
attempting to cash stolen securities. It has been noted
that even though the robber may not be apprehended at the
by these bank tellers, because of their training their
value as witnesses has been extremely worthwhile.

LEADS IN REPORTS 1

The leads set out in the initial report in
91-9161 indicate the projected investigation to consist
of reporting results of Laboratory examination, reviewing
State of California All Point Bulletins, maintaining eontact
with the San Francisco Police Department and reviewing
solved and unsolved West Coast bank robberies. This same
type of non-deseriptive lead is set out in the second report
in this same case. Similar non-descriptive leads are set
out in 91-9206 and 91~9419.

: Leads of this type are unimaginative and of
little value for the supervisor in evaluating the
projected investigation or for another Agent in having
such a case reassigned te him. The expression of such
leads does not represent the investigative potential of
which FBI Agents are capable and of which the San Francisco
Office has shown in its solution rate. Leads such as these
are merely passing our investigative responsibility to the
local authorities.

COPIES OF REPORTS

Three copies of the bank robbery report were
designated in 91-7976, 91-9377, 91-9225 and four copies of
the initial report were made in 91-9362, with no apparent
reason shown or explanation inade for the extra copy. All
Agents should be reminded that only two copies are made
in bank robbery cases in the interest of conserving file
space. When more copies are dictated for a particular need
such as multiple leads in several Resident Agencies the
extra copy should be destroyed and proper notation
made of this fact after its purpose has been served.

CASE SUGGESTIONS

In 91-9395 an unknown white female subject,
approximately 17 or 18 years old robbed the Wells Fargo
Bank in Berkeley, California. The Unknown Subject displayed
a note which note has not yet been forwarded to the Bureau.



-ll-

This note should be immediately sent to the FBI Laboratory.
In addition, an extremely clear photograph was taken of the
Unknown Subject and inasmuch as it appears from the photograph
and from descriptions obtained she is a "hippie type"

security informants familiar with the New Left element in
Berkeley should be contacted. Inasmuch as this case

involves a young female it is felt that additional contacts
with neighboring newspapers should be made in order to

have her picture publicized more widely than as heretofore
happened. Also contact should be made with the Berkeley
Campus Police Department to determine if it would be feasible
to display her photograph to college sources or counsellors
in an attempt to determine if this Unknown Subject may be

a student at the Berkeley Campus of the University of
California.

In 9$1+9277 it is noted. that the individual who
robbed this bank as depicted in the surveil. lance photograph
on July 24, 1970, is of excellent quality. Although this
photograph together with other bank robbery surveillance
photographs appeared in the "Oakland Tribune", Oakland,
California, 8/3/70, it is believed this is the type of
photograph that should receive additional newspaper publicity.
It is noted from past contacts with officials of the Bank

* of America they pian in the near future to publish in local
newspapers in the Bay Area a full page ad depicting surveillance
photographs in unsolved bank robbery cases. It is
recommended in contact with the Bank of America officials —
that this case be recommended as one that they publish in’
such an ad. In addition, any other circulation that can
be obtained through area newspapers should be utilized
in displaying this photograph.

In 91-8825, 91-9267, and 91-9456, all bank
robberies where good to excellent quality surveillance
photographs were obtained of the individual robbing the
banks. This individual was responsible for all three
bank robberies. It is noted this photograph has been

7 published in surrounding Bay Area newspapers but did not
appear in local San Francisco news media, inasmuch as all
three bank robberies occurred in San Francisco. Two of
these bank robberies were Bank of America banks and
consideration should be given to having this surveillance
photograph published in the contemplated ad to be placed by
Bank of America officials in San Francisco and Bay Area
newspapers in the near future. Likewise, consideration
should be given to extending circulation of this photograph

NW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 349 Yo (a)



-12- EEEHEEEE

to other news media and appropriate parole officials
and law enforcement agencies in the Bay Area.

MISCELLANEOUS

In 91-9427 it is noted the Subject of this
case is also a member of the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and was the Subject of a security matter in
the San Francisco Office.

In 91-9405 the Subject was also the Subject of

a Selective Service case, security matter case and an

Anti-Riot Law case in the San Francisco Office. These

examples are cited in order to show the need at this time

for maintaining. infor nt contacts not only Ww h

eriminal element but also with security informants throughout

your division. You should be constantly aware that

revolutionaries in this country have publicly stated that

they intend to finance their causes by bank robberies

and/or armed robberies and this emphasizes the need when

descriptions and photographs are obtained to distribute

these photographs and descriptions throughout all the
“personnel in your office. Agents working security type

cases should be made aware of the need in contacting their

informants to keep in mind that robberies have been committed

by these young revolutionaries in the past and undoubtedly

in the future they will continue to increase,

_ It is noteworthy that since the inspectors
arrived in the San Francisco Office an additional 10 previously
unsolved bank robberies have been solved through the
identification of the perpetrators who have been incarcerated
and are awaiting prosecution. The San Francisco Office
therefore now has a grand total of old and new pending
unsolved bank robbery matters in the amount of 76. The
percentage of solution of bank robbery violations is,
since the date of last inspection, now 79.2 percent.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM AND
INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITIES

PART A. GENERAL

1, The commercial or lucrative — of criminal
activity in the San Francisco Division continues to be
predominantly confined to the areas as noted below.
Exhaustive and probative investigation and close liaison
with local state and Federal agencies to date has revealed no
evidence of an organized criminal group controlling these
activities in, §an Francisco or Resident Agency territories.
Investigation contacts with informants and other sources of
information have failed to reveal the existence of any
organized iliegal gambling, lean sharking (Shylocking),
labor racketeering or planned bankruptcy frauds.

A. Local bookmaking involving horse and
sport bets conducted by numerous local
independent bookmakers, some of whom
Rave established "lay-off" arrangements

mata among themselves.

B. Prostitution activity primarily in the
"Tenderloin" section of San Francisco
involving out-of-town businessmen,
tourists, and servicemen with prostitutes,
most of whom are working for unorganized
negro “pimps",

C. Narcotic activity and related crimes

* usually involving thefts and frauds near
universities, military installations, and

t "hippie" or Bohemian sections of cities

within the division.

2. This office continues to enjoy an excellent rela-
tionship with the San Francisco Police Department and its
official personnel. Cooperation and excellent relationships

are known to exist between all Resident Agencies and the
‘local law enforcement agencies in their territories. No
evidence or information has been made available to this
office to indicate that there is any corruption in law
enforcement in this division,

As the Bureau is well aware, Mayor JOSEPH LAWRENCE
ALIOTO was the Subject of anti-racketeering investigation
by this office several years ago, however, this matter has
been closed. ALIOTO prior to assuming the position of Mayor
of the City of San Francisco was a prominent and well known
attorney, particularly in the field of anti-trust matters.
He.is known to have been the attorney for TONY LIMA, a former
"Boss" of the LCN in San Francisco. He also represented a
number of other LCN figures and their associates.

F Prior investigation revealed that the cousin of
ALIOTO's father, JOHN ALIOTO, was the former "Boss" of the
Milwaukee LCN Family. JOHN ALIOTO attended the inauguration
of Mayor ALIOTO at San Francisco in January 1968.

As a result of an article published in “Look”
- Magazine, September 23, 1969, linking ALIOTO with many LCN
: figures, ALIOTO filed a $12.5 million libel suit against
“Look” magazine and the authors of this article, RICHARD
CARLSON and LANCE BRISSON.

On May 15, 1970, Federal Judge BRUCE THOMPSON
declared a mistrial in San Francisco on this suit in that
the jury was unable to agree on the key issue of whether
the article linking ALIOTO with the "Mafia" was published
with "malice and reckless disregard for.the facts." The
jurors told newsmen that the article was defamatory to
ALIOTO and that at least 50 per cent of the 27 points were
indeed untrue. There was no agreement as to whether the
falsehoods and the article's general claim that ALIOTO was
“enmeshed in a web of alliances" with the "Mafia" represented
*"malice and reckless disregard for the facts." U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that such a finding is essential to a libel
judgment sought by a public official.

SAC R. E. GEBHARDT
10/22/70

On August 5, 1970, RUDOLPH RAPALE, brother-in-law
of Mayor ALIOTO, filed a $.2 million libel suit against

. "Look" magazine and CARLSON and BRESSON. This article re~

ferred to a trip by PAPALE to Mexico during which PAPALE met
with FRANK BOMPENSIERO, "CAPO", of the Los Angeles Family of
the LCN residing in San Diego to discuss a lard selling
permit in Mexico for a company of which PAPALE was former
president. :

On September 5, 1970, it was reported that retrial
of the ALIOTO $12.5 million libel suit against "Look" was
tentatively reset for May 3, 1971. :

San Francisco top level informants currently being
handled consist of four members of the LCN and ssixn TE
as. Our
LCN TE informants and ten PC target. info: port on LCN
activities of the San Francisco and San Jose Families as
well as LCN activities in other divisions. Our other TE
informants and our 36 PC target informants regularly report
on matters involving bookmaking, prostitution, pornography
and other criminal matters. As an indication cf the level
of our informant coverage since last inspection, SF 2689-C-TE .

_ assumed the position of "Boss" of the San Francisco LCN

Family. These informants due to their positions and locations
have made it possible to obtain top level information necessary
to provide coverage for Items 1 and 2.

4. Since last inspection extensive investigation as
well as informant coverage led to the first ITAR conviction
prosecutions ever in the San Francisco Division (ene Item 7
below). : .

; Investigation in the case CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTIN,
ITWI, case developed a “shakedown” by ECKSTIN against local
bookmaker VICTOR ROMOLO. This matter arose out of the failure
of ROMOLO to pay a bookmaking debt owed ECKSTIN. SALVATORE
VINCENT "BILL" BONANNO, JOSEPH BONANNO, JR., MAURICE PATRICK
HARTIGAN and MARTIN CHEIPETZ CARSON acting as agents for
ECKSTIN attempted to collect the $1,600 gambling debt and
during contacts with ROMOLO threatened him with physical harm

if he failed to pay the debt. This case is currently
under investigation with the matter being presented to
the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco for violation
of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, Extortionate Credit
Transaction Statute. an z
It should be pointed out that "BILL" BONANNO
and JOSEPH BONANNO, JR. are the sons of JOSEPH BONANNO, SR.,
a “Commission” member of the LCN in the United States.

. The aforementioned Subjects are also involved in
a separate ECT case involving the shakedown and threats to
do bodily harm to. WILLIAM JOSEPH ELLIS. This matter is
presently under investigation and will be presented to the
Federal Grand Jury, San Francisco immediately upon completion
-—. . O€ Grand Jury action in the ECKSTIN ECT case.

Since last inspection investigation has continued
in regard to GUISEPPI CONFORTE, the reported Vice Lord,
State of Nevada, who for years has headed up a major pros=-
titution operation. Through extensive investigation and
the placement of SF 3239-C~TE and SF 3369-C, this organization
has been completely penetrated identifying his lieutenants
and scope of operation. As a result of the akove, it has Leen
“determined that CONFORTE's operation has spread to the state
of Hawaii being controlled there by one of his top lieutenants,
TOMMY SEALE. San Francisco has under.preparation an affidavit
for a request of a Title 3 electronic surveillance on the
phones utilized by this organization in Honolulu. This Title 3
affidavit has been prepared with the assistance of Departmental
Attorney at San Francisco and who has discussed same with the
Organized Crime Section, Department of Justice, who has advised
that upon completion of current investigation in Honolulu the
affidavit should be immediately submitted for approval.

As another example of the progress made in the
penetration of the racketeering operation since the last
inspection information was received that HARRY JOHN JOHNSON

’ and ALAN “SUITCASE” FIDLER,::‘two. Boston “hit men” received a
contract, reportedly by a printer, to travel to San Francisco
and "straighten somebody out over..a union matter." JOHNSON,
a former resident of San Francisco, is known as a former
associate of JACK GOLDBERGER, top local Yeamster official

NW 55148 DoclId:32989637 Page 359° Qa 1/8,



SAC R. E. GEBHARDT
10/22/70 a ;

and reportedly JIMMY HOFFA's special West Coast representative.

i JOHNSON and FIDLER travelied to San Francisco from Boston in
January, 1970 and through surveillance and subsequent intensive
investigation it was determined that they met with one GEORGE
R. DUNCAN, International Representative, International
Typographers Union (ITU). It was determined that shortly
prior to the travel of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the San Francisco
area a strike situation existed at the San Rafael “Independent
Journal" newspaper involving the ITU. Through cooperation and
liaison with local law enforcement, JOHNSON and FIDLER were
arrested near San Rafael, California and found to be in

; possession of handguns and mace. Shortly after the return
o£ JOHNSON and FIDLER to the Boston area, an individual who
had knowledge that they had been given this contract was

| : found marceread in Beaten and on his body were found the names

| and telephone numbers cf JOHNSON and FIDLER. Through these

efforts the attempt by JOHNSON and FIDLER to perform the

conditions of the contract were thwarted. In addition, this

matter is being considered by Departmental Attorney for

possible Federal Grand Jury presentation.

ote Another example of progress made in the penetration
in the field of intelligence and erganized crime in this area
resulted when through information furnished by top echelon
informants revealing the presence of ALATADENO JAMES FRATIANNO
residing in the San Francisco territory. Through investigation
and surveillances conducted FRATIANNO was subsequently contacted
-and was developed as a top echelon target of this division.
Frequent contacts were conducted with FRATIANNO and extensive
cooperation was obtained from him concerning organized crime.
FRATIANNO was identified as a member of the Los Angeles Family
of the LCN and during August, 19706 was indicted by Federal
Grand Jury convening in San Francisco for two counts of
violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, ECT, Although
presently incarcerated FRATIANNO is being contacted periodically
as a target in an effort to continue development of his
cooperation. sea a

Increase in penetration of racketeering operations
since last inspection is evidenced by the above examples as
well as the statistical accomplishments reported. hereinafter.

8. Subsequent to the submission of last inspection

report, through information by top echelon informants this
office, information has been developed that SF 2689-C-TE
has assumed the position of "Boss" of the San Francisco
LCN Family.

SF 2656—-PC has reported to the return to the San
Jose area of STEFANO ZOCCOLI, Consiglieri of the San Jose LCN
Family from Los Angeles where he had been residing for the
past year.

During November 1969, SF 2656-PC reported that
GEORGE ADRAGNA, a member of Western Pennsylvania Family of
the LCN was coming to the San Jose area to live. Subsequently,
SF 2656-PC and SF 2689-C-TE reported that ADRAGNA's membership
had been transferred to the San Jose LCN Family and he is
currently residing in the San Jose area.

Subsequent to the submission of last inspection
report SF 2689-C~TE reported that JAMES FRATIANNO, a member
o£ the Los Angeles LCN Family had moved into the San Francisco
‘area where he remained until August when he commenced serving
a prison sentence executed by the State of California.

bat: During October, 1969, information was received
indicating that JERRY LISNER, major bookmaker, Los Angeles,
California was in contact with JOHN CASTELLI, bookmaker,
Oakland, California. The purpose of this contact was for
LISNER to establish a base of operation, particularly book-

_ making, for his criminal activities in the San Francisco
area, Investigation subsequently established that LISNER
and others commenced a bookmaking operation in Alameda and ”
Contra Costa Counties, East Bay Area, using as its front
A-1 TV Service, Oakland, which is owned by JOHN CASTELLI.
Following extensive investigation in cooperation with the
Oakland Police Department, no evidence was developed to
indicate any violation of Féderal statutes. On November 22,
1969, the Oakland and Berkeley, California Police Departments
simultaneously arrested SALVATORE J. BERNICE, JOHN TRAPPS and
two other associates who were engaged in LISNER's bookmaking

informant information and investigation conducted by the
San Francisco Office which revealed no Federal violation
and therefore was referred to local authorities. This
operation was determined to be a $90,000 a year “high class"

PART B: GAMBLING MATTERS

1. In the San Francisco Division there appears
to be two gambling operators that lead all others in terms
-of handle, volume, coverage, number of accounts, and
number of employees. These operators are CARL EZEKIAL
ECKSTEIN and CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., both of whom are
based in San Francisco. While they both handle substantial
individual accounts, ECKSTEIN and LEAHY are primarily
associated with and rely on lessor local bookmakers for
“action.” : :

CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has been
enyayed in gambling activities most of his adult life.
ECKSTEIN was formerly associated with TONY RUIZ and other
San Francisco bookmakers, but in the last year ECKSTEIN
has set up his own independent operation. ECKSTEIN has been
arrested on several occasions on charges of bookmaking but
has never been convicted of this violation. In 1965 ECKSTEIN
was convicted for failure to pay Federal wagering tax which
conviction was subsequently overturned. Details regarding
his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3.

CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., a native San Franciscan,
in his middle 40's, has been engaged in bookmaking activities
throughout his adult life. He was convicted in United
States District Court, San Francisco, in 1961 for arrest
on 9/28/60 for violation of Title 26, Section 7203, U.S.
Code, failure to report and pay wagering tax, and was
sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation.
Subsequent to his incarceration, LEAHY moved to Medford,
Oregon.. He returned to the San Francisco area in the Spring
of 1969 and resumed his bookmaking activities. During his
absence from San Francisco, his ex-brother~in-law, KENNETH
JOSEPH ZAHND, reportedly handled his, LEAHY's, bookmaking’
operation. LEAHY was recently arrested by the San Francisco
Police Department on local bookmaking charges and is
currently awaiting trial.

2. The types of gambling prevalent in the San
Francisco Division are primarily wagering on horse races
and sporting events. In addition, small numbers betting
“with a weekly drawing take place usually in the Spanish-
speaking communities. There are also legal and illegal
_card games operating usually in low-income commercial
neighborhoods. Gambling in the division is conducted by
individual operators who are independent of each other,
except for layoff purposes with respect to bookmaking and
there. are no indications of aaandnestail control over any of
these activities.

3. Concerning the extent of gambling in this
on, bookmakers ECKSTEIN and LEAHY, named in Paragraph
1 above, operate in the following manner. Both are in
daily contact with their accounts located in the Bay area
which include other bookmakers for layoff purposes, split
bookmakers, and numerous individual bettors.

aivi

Bets are placed with these operations generally
. at locations to which the general public has access, such
7 as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other small shops.
The "action" received at these business locations are in
turn called in to a phone spot operated by a bookmaker who
has a gambling relationship with the operator of the
business.

ECKSTEIN normally operates with six employees,
including two phone men, a bookkeeper, a pay & collect man,
and two runners, In addition, he utilizes several split
bookmakers as employees. The principal bookmakers and

“split bookmakers -involved in the ECKSTEIN bookmaking
operations are THEODORE CHALMIS, ALBERT DiGERONIMO, ELBERT
HEDRICK, MANNY PRONGOS, and ALBERT CARLSON. ECKSTEIN's
monthly handle based on informant data, evidence seized by
the San Francisco Police Department during recent bookmaking
raids, and interviews of bettors is estimated to be approxi-
mately $50,000 for horse bets. His sports "action" varies
with the season of the year and bettor interests in particu-
lar sporting events; however, ECKSTEIN's handle for sports
action is estimated to be $40,000 per month.

Investigation has determined that MATZA receives race
results by calling either California Turf, Los Angeles,

or J & K Sports Journal, North Hollywood, California,
operated by GERALD KILLGORE.

ch Since the last inspection, the San Francisco
Office has developed SF 2661-C-TE, who is a key operator
within the ECKSTEIN bookmaking organization. SF 3036-PC,
who was targeted at time of last inspection, has been
developed to the point where he furnishes detailed
information on a weekly basis regarding the LEAHY bookmak~
ing organization. This target is a split bookmaker handling
sports "action" for the LEAHY organizatiou. As a xesult

of information furnished by SF 3036-PC and SF 3237-C-TE,
LEAHY was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department
on 8/4/70 on charges of bookmaking and Gomvact in possession
of a weapon.

SF 3090-PC was targeted at the time of the last

7 inspection; however, during the past several months, he
: has furnished extensive information regarding several
large bookmaking operations.

7 . . SF 3387-C was developed since the last inspection
- and was responsible for the initial information and identifi-

cation of a major bookmaking operation in the East Bay area,

“including Oakland, California, and Naval Air Station,
Alameda, California. The informant's information led to
the arrest and subsequent conviction of the two major
operators within, the organization in United States District
Court, San Francisco. In addition, based on informant's
information and ‘investigation by this office, there were
two arrests and convictions effected by local authorities,

' Oakland.

As a result of extensive investigation in the
ECKSTEIN ITWI case, a "Shakedown" on the part of ECKSTEIN
against a local bookmaker was developed. This investigation

-has resulted in two major ECT cases involving non-payment
of bookmaking debts which are currently under investigation
and before the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco. To
date, eight local bookmakers have appeared before the
Federal Grand Jury and others will be called. This has had
a disruptive effect among bookmakers and has created an
atmosphere of distrust.

6. Pursuant to instructions set forth in Bureau
letter to SAC Albany 1/27/70 regarding gambling investiga-
tions under proposed SB30, a review of gambling cases was
undertaken. It shovld be pointed out that during the past
three years, it has been the policy of the San Francisco
Office to closely follow the activities of local gambling
organizations and/or subjects in an attempt to develop any
indication of a Federal gambling violation. Per instructions
additional 162 and 165 cases have been opened and investigated.
Specifically since 2/1/7Q sixty-three 162 cases and ninety-
eight 165 cases have been opened.

aes The La Cosa Nostra (LCN) continues to exist in the Northern
California area and includes a San Francisco "family"
and a San Jose "family." There are currently 8 members of the

San Francisco "family" residing in this division and 19 members
of the San Jose "family" residing in this division. In addition,
there are two members of the San Francisco "family" residing in
the Sacramento Division, one member in the Los Angeles Division,
one in the Chicago Division and two members presently residing

in Italy. There are currently 3 members of the San Jose "family"
residing in the Sacramento Division and one in the Las Vegas
Division. All of these members have been identified as members

of the San Francisco or San Jose "families by TE informants

of the San Francisco Division.

Four top echelon informants of this division who are
members of LCN "families" have failed to indicate that the LCN
"families" of this division register any control over gambling,
narcotics, prostitution or any other organized iiiegal activity
within this division.

The present leadership of the San Francisco "family"
has recently been assumed by ANTHONY LIMA, who took over this
position when the previous "boss", JAMES JOSEPH LANZA, stepped
down in his favor. The "underbogs" of the San Francisco "family"
is GASPARE "BILL" SCIORTINO and this "family" has one Capo de
Decina, VINCENZO INFUSINO, who resides in negro California,
in the Sacramento Division.

The leadership of the San Jose "family" remains the same
as at the time of the last inspection report with JOSEPH CERRITO,
the "boss," PHILIPPO OCTAVIO MORICI and STEFANO ZOCCOLI,
Consiglieris, and one Capo de Decina, EMANUEL FIGLIA. No‘ap-
pointment has been made to the position of "underboss" since
the death of the previous "underboss," CHARLES CARBONE, in 1967.

: and 19 members of the San Jose "family" residing in this
territory. “All of these members have been identified by TE
eriminal informants of this division.

or associates of members of the LCN have been alerted to con-
tinue to furnish information and identities of any individuals

j has indicated that the recruits are the "second army" of the

| LCN and to be aware of and on top of activities of the LCN,

i it is necessary to identify these recruits. Since the last
inspection, TE informants have identified an additional 11
recruits of the San Francisco and San Jose "families" residing
in this territory or in the Sacramento territory.

As has been reported above, TE informant: of this office
reported the change in leadership of the "boss" of the San
Francisco "family" when JAMES LANZA stepped down in favor of
ANTHONY LIMA.

“In addition, informants of this office reported the
return to’ the San Jose area of Consiglieri STEFANO ZOCCOLI, who
has been residing in the Los Angeles territory.

3. The following TE criminal informants are members of the
LCN in the San Francisco territory:

SF-2550-C-TE
SF-2689-C~TE
SP-2745-C~TE
SF-3208-C~TE

i Agents of the San Francisco Division currently involved
in the development of TE criminal informants and in AR investiga-
fi tions are contacting the following PC targets who are members

of the LCN in this territory. in an effort to develop their

with appropriate personnel:

LA COSA NOSTRA (LCN)

| Investigation by your office revealed the existence
of two LCN "families" within your territory. Membership ~
within these "families" total 64 individuals. Your

investigation revealed neither “family” is considered to be

very strong and has little or no illegal operations being

conducted on a day to day basis.
i One "family" is centered in the San Francisco area
i" - _ and nas for the past few years been headed by James Lanza,
i an attendee at the Apalachin meeting in 1957. lanza has
< recently stepped down as boss of the San Francisco “family”
‘ and has been replaced by Toni Lima. Your investigation
¥ reveals that Lima's leadership has not been approved by
the "commission." You should follow this matter closely
so you will be in a position to know all activities relating
{ . _,*to this change in position. .
| a . fhe second “family" is centered in the San Jose area I

: and is headed by boss Joe Cerrito. This "family" exhibits

: little enthusiasm for illegal operations. You should closely
: + follow the activities of members of this “family” to insure
that any illegal operations are immediately known to your

office.

Organized Crime ¥ ae
Although prostitution, gambling and narcotic activities
exist within your division, there is no indication from your |
investigations that these operations are controlled by either
the LCN or other organized groups. Your investigations
should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your
office will be aware of any illegal operations within your |
division. This is particularly true in regard to gambling
activities in view ofthe recent passage of Senate Bill 30. |

As you are aware provisions of Senate Bill 30 made it a

not be necessary to prove interstate aspects of the
gambling activity.

It is noted your office has penetrated the LCN
"families" in both San Jose and San Francisco through the
development of member informants. This is very noteworthy
and you are encouraged to make certain that your member
informants are utilized to the best advantage of the Bureau.

, Also, it is noteworthy that you have increased your TE
.coverage from 7 to 10 since the last inspection.

SF 3058-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-4670; Bureau
file 137-17455) was rated fair because of a lack of productivity.
You should follow instructions issued in Bureau letter dated
July 14, 1970 and if this informant is unproductive for four
months subsequent to the receipt of that letter the informant
should be closed.

Although SF 2745-C-TE (san Francisco file 137-3456;
Bureau file 137-11174) was rated good, his progress should
be closely followed. Although he is noted to be a member
informant the file indicates he is very sick with varicose
veins and is very old. The majority of information furnished
by this source has been of a nature of past activities and
little present information is being furnished by him. You
should endeavor to have him furnish more productive recent
informant or give consideration to concentrate on a more
productive source.

A review of your file 137-5207, Bureau file 137-20313
concerning SF 3208-C-TE indicates the source was last contacted
on June 26, 1970. The file indicates this source sold his
business and left for Los Angeles and this information was
learned by your office on August 13, 1970. The file also
indicates this TE left the New York area because of being
a victim of a shylock loan. In view of this information
you should closely follow this informant's activities and
be circumspect in dealing with the informant to prevent
any possible embarrassing situation from arising.

The following is a rating of the PCs and a comparison
with the ratings at the time of the last inspection:

It is very encouraging to note that you have increased
your targets from 39 from the time of the last inspection to
- 46 at the time of this inspection. You are encouraged to
‘continue this most desirable trend.

SF 2123-PC (San Francisco file "137-4945; Burgau file
137-11841) was rated fair. This target was opened on April
8, 1968 and was last contacted on October 10, 1969. You
advised that contact is being held in abeyance pending a
surveillance which was conducted by the Oakland Police
Department in early 1970. In view of the length of time
since this case was opened and the length of time since this
target was contacted he was rated fair.

! SF 2630-PC (San Francisco file 137-2967; Bureau file
137-9023) was rated fair. By letter dated December 10, 1968
the Bureau advised that this target was over two years old
and that you should consider deleting within four months if
he was unproductive. This informant was also rated fair
during the last inspection because of lack of productivity.

The only reason this informant is being classified fair
instead of poor is because information contained in your
letter to the Bureau dated September 18, 1970 wherein your
informant reported information was furnished by a TE to

the effect that the present "boss" of the San Francisco

LCN “family” had been discussing leadership of the San
Francisco LCN with the target. You are instructed that

in the event he does not furnish valuable positive information
Within 90 days he should be closed and a more suitable target
developed.

SF 3061~PC (San Francisco file 137-4768; Bureau file
137-17558) was also rated fair. This target along with the
other two targets rated fair should be closely followed for
90 days and be given specific assignments during that period
of time. In the event they are unproductive they should be
closed. 7

137-8249) was rated poor “and should be ripe

In regard to your PCs, the following specific
instructions are being furnished you:

SF 2656-PC (San Francisco file 137~3086; Bureau file
137-9425) was rated good because of his being close to San
Jose LCN member Dominick Anzalone and Pittsburgh LCN member
George Adragna who recently moved to San Jose. He is also
close to LCN "recruit" Vito Adragna. It is noted that this
target has been opened for a period of more than one yar
and has been furnishing general rather than any specific
information. You should encourage this informant to furnish

, Some specific information concerning these people who he

. your office,

is close to in order that he may be retained as a target of

SF 3318-PC (San Francisco file 137-5545; Bureau file
137-22526) has been a target of your office since December

| 26, 1969. Unless your office isin possession of some

specific information to the contrary he should be immediately
interviewed to determine whether he will be cooperative

. with your office.

SF 3135-PC (San Francisco file 137-5010; Bureau file
137-19079) was opened on May 17, 1968. During the two
inspections since he was opened this PC was rated Unsufficient

interview of this PC was being held in abeyance pending an
investigation by the Oakland, California Police Department.
The file indicates that that investigation was completed on
August 6, 1970 with your target paying a $125 fine. On
August 19, 1970 you advised that interview of the target
was being delayed pending further investigation. You are
instructed that this interview should be immediately conducted
in order to determine if this target will be cooperative with
your office.

_ SF 3297-PC (San Francisco file 137-5457; Bureau file
137-22106) was opened on October 17, 1969. ‘The file indicates
that this target has never been interviewed and you indicate
that contact with the target is being delayed until a more
logical area of vulnerability is developed. Inasmuch as
this target is ever onc yoar old it is felt that sufficient

‘information should be developed so that your office might

approach this target to determine if he will be cooperative
with your office.

' SF 3192-PC (san Francisco file 137-5016; Bureau file
137-10982) was opened on May 21, 1968. SF 3110-PC (San
Francisco file 137-2182; Bureau file 137-22452) has been

“ opened since December 8, 1969. It would appear that

sufficient time has elapsed in order for your office to
develop background information so that an interview of

these targets can be conducted. You should without further
delay interview these targets to determine if they will be
cooperative and if not you should consider closing and finding
more suitable targets for development.

Z Information you furnished indicates there are ten
SAs who are working either exclusively or virtually exclusively

.on the CIP and IGA program who have not developed TEs.

Although all ten Agents have PCs their progress should be
closely followed to insure their participation in the
development of TEs. In this regard you may desire to
reiterate provisions of the Manual of Instructions to the
Agents on the program concerning the eee eeeene of TE
informants. _ ,

All Agents are to be reminded that in dealing with
informants, they are to be particularly alert and not
leave themselves open for criticism or false accusations.
The importance of having an alternate contacting Agent
or another Agent along during the course of certain
interviews is advisable in case any compromising situation
is attempted.

With the recent enactment of Senate Bill 30 you
should concentrate on increasing your informant coverage in
the areas covered by this legislation. Also in regard to
the passage of Senate Bill 30 dealing with gambling, which
you are aware does not now require interstate activity, you
should not overlook the utilization of your racial informants
to furnish information to your office concerning gambling
activities. Other divisions of the Bureau have been
particularly successful in coordinating the information
from racial informants in to the CIP and IGA programs.

Staiisiival Accomplishments: - --

During the fiscal year (fy) you recorded two convictions
in the CIP-IGA category. During the fy 1970 your office had
three convictions. During the first three months of fy 1971
you have recorded one conviction in this category.

According to the information furnished by your office
you have four cases pending prosecution, two of which are
in the 159 (LMRDA-IM) category and two are in the 92
(Anti-Racketeering) category. Only one of these cases is
in the CIP-IGA program. A review of your files indicates
that in file 179-24 in a case captioned JAMES FRATIANNO,
EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTION (ECT), the subject was
indicted:under Title 18, Section 894 of the U.S. Code.
Your office was working the case under AntizRacketeering
classification and the file was opened after the ECT
indictment. a

In-regard:-to the possible statistical accomplishments,
from the above file it would appear the local office of the
United States Attorney will seek indictments under the ECT
statute. A review of your cases in this category reveal only
three Office of Origin cases. The files also indicate instances
wherein there are shylocking activities among the gamblers
where there are large debts outstanding. A review of your

ABS,



i rf i . '
7 “30

file.165-100 on Kenneth Joseph Zahnd, aka; Morris Cooper,
ITWI, indicates the local office of the United States Attorney
appears to be in no rush to seek Grand Jury indictments on
gambling matters. If the local office of the United States
Attorney will entertain prosecution under ECT and is in

no rush to seek indictments under the gambling statute,

you should review at squad conferences with Agents assigned
to the program provisions of SAC letter 68-46 dated August

20, 1968 wherein provisions of the ECT statute are set forth.

In relation to statistical accomplishments, prior
experience has shown a direct relationship between Office
of Origin cases in a particular classification and statistical
accomplishments. As of September 30, 1970 your monthly
administrative report reflects the following Office of Origin
cases in the categories enumerated:

A review of the monthly administrative reports since
the last inspection indicates your office of origin cases
-has remained fairly constant since the last inspection.

With the increase of manpower on this program and the
addition of informant development since the last inspection
it is anticipated that your office should be in position at
this point to begin to show results in regard to the
statistical accomplishment phase of this program.

¢
Supervision And Manpower

. The CIP and IGA program is supervised by Supervisor
Charles N. Hiner. Discussions with Supervisor Hiner and
personnel assigned to the program indicate a very enthusiastic
approach to the problems involved in this program.

Immediately prior to the last inspection, by letter
May 29, 1970 captioned "CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,
ASSIGNMENT OF ADDITIONAL MANPOWER," you advised the Bureau
of the addition of ten Agents to be assigned exclusively
to this program. Your success since that time has been
noted by the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969.
Also you have added three TEs to the program and seven
additional PCs. This is to your credit and you are encouraged
to continue this favorable trend. However, the collection
of. intelligence information, though very important, is only
one phase of this program. The other. phase of the program
which must receive close supervision and personal attention
is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's
responsibility toward statistical accomplishments.

. In regard to statistical accomplishments, other
divisions of the Bureau have been very successful in

the utilization of Title 3. The utilization of Title 3
requires extensive use of waupower and if the Title 3 you
are presently awaiting approval is approved you should
judiciously use manpower in the operation _ the Title 3
installation.

In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is
imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show
, the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of
intelligence information and statistical accomplishments.
In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to
show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given
to-the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.

Administration And Files

Several instances were noted wherein the "pink sheet"
were not completed although the informant files have been

There were four instances wherein you were instructed
during the last inspection to complete the pink sheet and
although 14 months have passed since last inspection these
pink sheets have not been completed. While failure to
complete the pink sheet when instructed does not necessarily
indicate an Agent's enthusiasm in working this program, it
does not show the desired attitude. These four instances
are as follows:

A review of your 162 files indicates several instances

wherein Bureau instructions were not followed. These Bu 2
instructions were set torth in Bureau airtel dated April 2,
1969, captioned "INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITY MATTERS." This
is found in your file 162-00-21. Briefly, these instructions
stated that the 162 classification should be reserved for
"“intelligence-type" inquiries and that substantive cases
should be opened under the proper classification. These

Dissemination

“Your office has been very successful in obtaining |
favorable ‘results in dissemination of information to local
law enforcement agencies concerning local violations
developed during the investigation. You are encouraged
to continue this favorable trend; however, you should
bear in mind that violaiionus ihat were strictly local in
nature previously may now be covered by the recent enactment
of Senate Bill 30. Those which are determined to be Federal
violations, of course, should be prosecuted in Federal
court,

New Legislation

A review of your files indicates you have complied
‘with Bureau letter dated January 27, 1970, concerning the
then proposed Senate Bill 30. You should closely follow
. guidelines formulated by the Bureau in regard to this
“new legislation in order that your office will be abreast
of the latest information so that the Bureau's responsibilities
in the organized crime field can be fulfilled.

Observations and Instructions

J (1) Provisions of Title 3, the Extortionate Credit

i Transaction statute and of the Manual of Instructions
concerning the qualification of TEs should be reiterated

_ to all Agents on the program at squad conferences.

: (2) You should stress to all Agents on the program
the necessity of developing quality TEs.

(3) You should stress the necessity of proper
utilization of Title 3 installations as other field divisions
have been very successful in this regard in obtaining a
backlog of potential statistical accomplishments.

(4) You should concentrate on quality cases which
have prosecutive potential which will obtain the desired -
statistical accomplishments.

SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS Pl dewes

Mh

INSPECTOR AR}

ve. LARSON: The following ‘comments, °

observations, recommendations
and instructions are being made after an in-depth review of
a representative number of your Selective Service Act matter
cases and administrative files along with conversations with
supervisory and Agent personnel and review of the answers to
questions in a separate yellow (4-M-5):

The San Francisco area is a
haven to draft dodgers and this undesirable situation will
not be reversed until we make this area unattractive for
“bums,"“hippies," and members of white and black extremist
groups who come to San Francisco in order to avoid the draft.
Several obstacles must be surmounted in order to reverse this
undesirable situation. The indifferent attitude that the
judges have displayed to date must be reversed towards a

tough handling of Selective Service Act violators. Supervisory

and Agent personne] mast maintain an aggressive attitude and
continue to be a leader in streamlining processing procedures
by the United States Attorney's Office and various Selective
Service Boards to insure that these violators are promptly
prosecuted in the courts. Every technique available to the
Bureau should be used to get the judges, United States
Attorney and public riled up about this ridicuious situation.
Aggravated violators should be put in jail.

There are 2,983 "hippie-type”
communes in the San Francisco Division comprising in excess
of 20,000 population. 1,050 of these communes are located in
the Berkeley and Oakland areas comprising in excess of!10,000

population and 43 communes are known to be violently oriented.

Your office has eight subjects who have committed Selective
Service Act violations that are members of white and black
extremist groups. Every effort should be made to take these
individuals out ofcirculation by placing them in jail.
Information concerning their activities with extremist groups
should be furnished to the probation officers so that they
can so inform the judges in their presentencing report. All
Agents handling Racial Matters and Selective Service Act
matters should be periodically reminded to be on the alert

It is evident from the
backlog of cases awaiting trial (414), backlog of cases
awaiting prosecutive action by the Federal Grand Jury
(749) and the fact that these violations are being re-
ceived by your office at the average rate of 175 cases
per month, that something must be done to get these
cases before the courts. The most aggravated cases should
be singled out and tried first, particularly those indi-
viduals who are members of extremist groups. Experience
has shown that after several subjects have received rigid
sentences, and a widely publicized trial, that many subjects
enter guilty pleas hoping for lesser sentences by avoiding
the Government the expense of a trial.

It is recognized the San ,

Francisco Division has been most forcefully making every

effort to expedite the handling of these cases, particularly
through the judiciary. Indications are that the relatively
newly appointed United States Attorney is sympathetic and

receptive to the problem and is making an effort to diminish
the backlog of cases awaiting Grand Jury presentations, but
it is recognized once an indictment is returned, it is then
up to the judiciary to proceed through the final step, to

.whic¢h they have not been particularly receptive. They have

,’ not responded enthusiastically to handling these matters in

Federal Court.

It is obvious the Federal
Judges in Northern California (San Francisco Division) have
resisted any and all pressures brought to bear upon them
concerning this problem. In my analysis of this situation,
I have determined that the United States Attorney's Office,
personnel of the FBI, and Selective Service personnel have
all attempted to influénce the Judges in handling these
Matters more expeditiously to no avail. Furthermore, within
recent months there has been wide-spread nation-wide publicity
relative to their coddling and minimizing this particular
problem. This apparently has had no effect upon them. It
would, therefore, appear that the various Federal Judges
will not react to this problem unless some superior influential
individual or group can forcefully bring this matter to théir
attention, particularly if such individual or group is one
which the Federal Judges would respect. The obvious answer
is the Administrator of the Courts for the Federal Judicial
System in Washington, D.C. and/or Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, WARREN BURGER.

NW 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 393 > L [



-5- A-M-5

You are, therefore, instructed
to suggest to the Bureau that the contents of the letterhead
memorandum setting forth this overall problem be brought to
the attention of the Attorney General with the further sug-
gestion that the Attorney General bring this matter to the
attention of the Administrator of the Courts of the Federal
Judicial System and/or Chief Justice BURGER for his analysis
and information, and the further suggestion he may desire to
communicate with the Chief Federal Judge in San Francisco
relative to these matters. : +

SAC, ASAC, Supervisory and
Agent personnel should take advantage of every opportunity
to personally discuss this aggravated situation with the
United States Attorney, Selective Service Board officials,
SAC contacts and other prominent individuals to get them
riled up about this ridiculous situation. Tnevre that -

. continuous close liaison is maintained by supervisory and
Agent personnel with United States Attorney's Office and
various local draft board officials to insure that these
ceases are promptly processed and prosecuted.

Your office in April, 1969
suggested to the former United States Attorney that arresting
_several inductees on the spot might have a favorable effect
upon lowering the rate of refusals at the Oakland Induction
Center. The only objection given by the former United States
Attorney was that the case of the registrant must be presented
to the Federal Grand Jury within two weeks after arrest. Due
to your effective liaison, most of the "bottlenecks" have been
worked out between the Selective Service Board and United
States Attorney's Office in which these arrests can now be
effected. You shauld be alert to members of éxtremist groups
who will fail to step forward at the time of their induction
and appropriately arrange with the United States Attorney for
authority to arrest these individuals on the spot. You should
insure that such arrests are given adequate press coverage.
Such plans should be brought to the attention of the Bureau
for their consideration in making a national press release,
if warranted.

You must closely coordinate
Selective Service Act cases with Agents handling extremist
groups such as the Black Panther Party, Weatherman, SDS, etc.
These files should be cross-referenced by appropriate
memoranda.

Statistical Accomplishments and Administrative Handling of Cases

As of 9/30/70, you had 1,873 origin Selective

Service matters (1,799 active and 74 inactive). Between
March and September 1970 you received 1,186 Selective Service
Act mdtters for investigation, an average of 169 (1,186 ~ 7)
per month. As of 10/23/70, 1,163 of the origin cases were
completed. 743 cases are awaiting the United States
Attorney's (USA) prosecutive decision, and 414 cases involve
indictments of subjects and are awaiting trial. The case
load is split about in half between Headquarters City and
Resident Agents. 17 Agents are assigned to Squad 6 who
handle only Selective Service Act (SSA) matters and their
informants. One Agent has been on extended sick leave.
Approximately 18 Resident Agents spend between 60 to 100%

of their time on Selective Service Act matters. During

the fiscal year 1970, ending 6/30/70, you recorded 74
convictions and for the first four months of fiscal year 1971,
ending 9/20/70, you have recorded $ convictions. i

The procedures followed by your office concerning

the immediate handling of subjects who refuse to step forward

at the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, Oakland, 4
California, appear to save Agent time and Government expense
and should be continued. It is noted, however, that several
months elapse between the time the Subject is interviewed and
‘the time the United States Attorney makes his prosecutive
decision since he insists that the Selective Service file be
processed and forwarded to his office by the State Director of
the Selective Service Board. You should have Headquarters

eity Agents continue close liaison with Selective Service
Boards and the United States Attorney's Office to insure that
. these cases receive expeditious processing and are presented to
the. Federal Grand Jury at an early date.

Current administrative procedures being ferowed in
these refusal type cases are as follows:- r

The Induction Officer at the Armed Forces. Examining
and Entrance Station, Oakland, California, calls an Oakland |
Agent when there is going to be one or more inductees who will
refuse to submit to induction. Inductions are handled on
a Wednesday of each week. The Special Agent witnesses the
refusal, conducts a short interview of the Subject, and in
almost every instance secures an admission from the Subject
that he knew he was violating the law and that he had thought

_ceanneclenentdmana-eih + nen se nmanannatAesennenrhnindiDonetntt ian PAAR CAT

RAYS,

AW 55146 DocId:32989637 Page 395



about this matter carefully before refusing to step

forward. The Agent during this interview obtains the Subject 's
current address which is generally different from the one he
furnished the Selective Service Board. The Agent places

the Subject on notice as to what probably will occur as to an
indictment, summons, etc. The Subject is cautioned to remain
in touch with his Local Draft Board in order to avoid being

a Bureau fugitive. : i

A case is immediately opened and assigned to the
Oakland Agent who prepares a report. Information copies of
the report are furnished to the local USA, San Francisco:and
‘tthe field office and the USA covering the Subject's draft
board when located in another division. It is the USA's
opinion (San Francisco) that the refusal to step forward takes
precedence over any prior delinquencies and will be handled
by the USA, San Francisco. Instructions are given in leads
to Headquarters city Agents and/or auxiliary offices to
Glosely follow the Local Board to insure that all pertinent
information regarding the Subject is promptly furnished
to the USA, San Francisco.

In order to streamline the administrative handling
of these matters as well as keeping the Bureau fully
informed of the activity you are taking in these matters to
insure prompt prosecutive handling, the following instructions

. should be followed:

All refusal cases and all other cases in which

" the investigation is completed should be reassigned to three or

four Headquarters city Agents. These Agents will have
the responsibility of getting these cases to the Federal
Grand Jury and on the trial calendar. Those cases in which
the subject becomes a fugitive should be reassigned to another
case Agent. :
At the present time there are 1163 cases pending
prosecutive action. In order.to eliminate status letters and
reports to the Bureau in these type cases, the following
procedures should be followed.

Memos to the SAC should be placed in individual
files to keep them from becoming delinquent. When the
Subject is indicted the Bureau should be immediately advised
in each individual case. Beginning 10/30/70 and continuing
on the 15th and 30th of each subsequent month, you are to
advise the Bureau, by letter, entitled "SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT
MATTERS, SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION" of the activity conducted,

which would include the total number of cases presented

: to the Federal Grand Jury during the prior two week period,
identifying each case by San Francisco file number, Bureau
file number and title; the number of cases completed and
awaiting Federal Grand Jury action; number of new cases
received for investigation and general comments concerning
the attitude of the USA's Office and U.S. District Courts
concerning these matters. Also you should comment on any
favorable publicity being given these matters by the local
press media.

In the refusal cases the Bureau should be specifically
advised of the status of a case within five months after the
violation, The USA should be requested to advise of the
prosecutive action he intends to take in each case and this
information reported in the individual file.

. It is felt that better liaison can be mdiniained
with the USA's Office when only two or three Special Agents
present these cases in a group thereby eliminating 30 to 35
different Agents presenting their cases separately. The
Bureau will be kept advised on a semi-monthly basis of
the activities of your office in getting these SSA matters
through the courts. The above procedures will eliminate
‘the dictation and typing of approximately 750 pages each
month,

There are a sufficient number of SSA cases in
Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose and San Francisco for your
consideration of having a Special Clerk handle the
. review of Selective Service Board records. You should
closely review these situations in these particular areas
and if warranted recommendations for hiring Special Clerks.

Administrative Handling of Theft
From Interstate Shipment Cases in
: the San Francisco Division

F) . aE ~
INSPEG OR“ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the course of the
4 inspection of the San Francisco
Office a review was made of 140 Theft From Interstate Shipment
cases. Instances were noted wherein Bureau Regulations
“concerning the handling of these cases were not followed. Set
forth below are instances noted during this review:

In the following cases, it was noted the amount
involved appeared to be a minor amount and there appeared to
be no aggravating circumstances concerning these violations.
In some instances concerning the cases which originated at the
San Francisco Airport, it was noted the file indicated there
was a possibility of an individual at the airport being involved
in the theft. However, it is felt it is not necessary to keep
open all the minor cases in order to determine which, if any,
employees at the airport may be involved. These cases where
minor amounts are involved are as follows:

indication that the FD-302s had been dictated.

(supervisor GLENN A. HARTER: 1) This office received a
ied a 10/28/70 letter from the U.S. Attorney
dated 6/24/69 wherein the
U.S. Attorney advised that they would not undertake prosecution
of minor theft cases. The letter set the guide as those
cases of value of less than $100. This office has been
following the interpretation of minor thefts as those having
a value of less than $100. It was the judgment of this
office that dout all of the airport thefts involved amounts
in excess of $100. It appears that an average loss at the
airport would average an estimated $250, it being noted that
the airline companies currently are paying up to $500 per
bag. Therefore, these cases were not judged to be minor
eases and had not been discussed with the U.S. Attorney as
“their value exceeded $100. In following this policy San
Francisco believed that they were in compliance with Section 9h
of the Manual regarding presentation of minor cases to the
uS. Attorney. In the future tnis office will immediately
. present cases of the type cited by the Inspector to the
U.S. Attorney before any investigation is conducted and
will consider suitcase type thefts as minor cases.

2)Submission of FD 302s. Regarding
the fact that I had not detected that FD 302s were not
included in the 25 files listed by the Inspector, I would
like to explain that 13 of these files were opened after
September 22 and I had not reviewed any of these files
as yet on tickler and thereby would not have had an
opportunity to detect the fact that the FD 302 was not
listed. The remaining files have not all been available
for review at this time but it is obvious that some of
these files did not have FD 302s prepared >~.« promptly.

3)NCIC Entries. Three of the
four files listed where NCIC entries had not been made
: had not as yet been reviewed on ticklers since they had been
| veceived in this office. One of the four files, 15-11994, re-
flects a suitcase claim check number which is not suitable
| for entry into the NCIC.

| 4) File 15-11981 was recommended
to be opened by the case Agent as he felt that this

| shipment involved personnel and circumstances which

| would be logically worked in connection with other existing
TFIS cases and that it might be a lever for possible
informant development. The Agent hoped to work this case
even though it was not a Federal violation and obtain an

zara tod

informant and utilizing the Subject's complicity in the
case as a possible lever. It was believed that he
could obtain a criminal informant.

I regret very much that it was
necessary for the Inspector to call to my attention the
matters referred to in this administrative write-up. I
will take the necessary action to insure that minor cases
are immediately presented to the U.S. Attorney, that FD 302s
are immediately prepared, that NCIC numbers be immediately
entered where pertinent so that it will not be necessary
for these matters to be called to my attention again.

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHARDT: The USA advised this office by
\ letter dated 7/16/69 that the
FBI should no longer present minor theft cases to the USA's

. office and that these cases should be deferred to local

courts. The office has followed the policy set down by the
‘UA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case.

In view of his policy, the office has not been receiving minor
theft cases, as the local business community has been made
aware of the policy of the USA and has not been referring
minor cases to the office. :

Occasionally some minor case is received from
someone not aware of the policy of the USA's office in not
prosecuting cases having a value of less than $100. In the
future when a complaint is received regarding a minor theft,
the case will be immediately presented to the USA and after
his declination, the office will advise the complainant and
the USA's office in writing and where appropriate, refer the
complaint to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the violation. This procedure will pe in line with the
requirements in the Manual of Inspection, Section 94.



ADDENDUM

&

fy
INSPECTOR AR bis. LARSON: In regard to your answer to this

write-up, the following is

pointed out to you:

1. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that

all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts. This is completely
inaccurate as each case, whether it be a suitcase or otherwise,
has to be judged on the merits of the individual case. In

the review of 140 cases there was not one single instance
wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to
determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not
entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified.

2. Concerning the submissions of FD-302's to the

file, the following is a tabulation of cases over two months
old in which no FD-302 is in the file:

FILE NUMBER DATE OPENED

15-11918 8/14/70

15-11816 7/6/10

15-11814 7/2/70

15-11947 8/26/70 .
15-11818 7/10/70 Perea
15-11902 8/25/70 a
15-11939 8/28/70

15~-11933 8/21/70

Although the remainder of the 25 files pointed out to

you did not contain FD-302's and the files had not come

up on ticklers for your review, it is apparent with this
number of files without FD-302's the Agents are not receiving
adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper
preparing of FD-302's in TPIS cases.

ASE.



-9-

3. Although it was pointed out to you wherein

NCIC entries on serial numbers had not come up for adminis-
trative review, it is apparent that several Agents on your
squad have not been properly instructed in the necessity

of immediately entering serial numbers into NCIC. It should
not be necessary for you to have to remind Agents on your
squad on a periodic file review of the necessity of entering
serial numbers into NCIC. They should not wait an extended
period of time to enter these numbers in NCIC, but the serial
-numbers should be entered immediately after they are obtained.

4. File 15-11981 was of a purely local nature and
should have been worked out of the related Federal violation
case rather than open a separate TFIS case wherein no
Federal jurisdiction was indicated in the opening serial.

DESTRUCTION OF i
CHANNELIZING MEMORANDUM

-
INSPECTOR aid C. LARSON: Manual of Rules and Regulations,
ue Part II, Section 3, Page 15b,
provides for the procedure to follow in the destruction of
copies of informant channelizing memoranda after the pertinent
information has been incorporated into report form.

: While reviewing files during
this inspection, it was noted that copies of channelizing
memoranda are not being destroyed through the use of Form
FD-338 after the pertinent portions of the memoranda have been
incorporated into reports.

In some instances the portions
of the channelizing memoranda pertaining to specific stb jects
was of such ainox importance so as to preclude their use in
reports,

As examples, the following files
containing copies of channelizing memoranda which could have
been destroyed after the pertinent portions of the memoranda
had been incorporated into report form:

65-1242 : 100-629 1
100-51780 _100-62978
100-56804 100-64936

100-62319 : 157-3330
100-62728 157-3890

Some of the above-mentioned
files consist of numerous volumes and contain large numbers
of channelizing memoranda which could have been destroyed.
As examples:

‘

The growth of many of these
security files and others will necessarily continue, There-
fore, the need to utilize FD-338 is extremely desirable. You
should insure that all Agents handling these matters are
thoroughly impressed with the importance of utilizing FD-338
on a continuing basis. This form can be easily executed when

“the Agents are actually reviewing files, serial by serial, in
preparing reports. Many of these security-type files contain
old channelizing memoranda which could have been ‘destroyed at
the time previous reports were prepared. It is suggested when
future reports are prepared in these matters the respective
case agent thoroughly review the entire file to destroy those
old channelizing memoranda containing information which had
been incorporated into those previous reports.

During such individual review,
* the provisions of Manual of Rules and Regulations, vart Ii,
| Section 3, Page llc, which provide for the destruction of
| copies of serials could also be implemented.

| : Such systematic individual

| approach to the destruction of channelizing memoranda pursuant
to existing Bureau instructions should contribute immeasurably
_ to the conserving of valuable filing space together with
making these files more manageable, As you are aware, the
need for additional filing space is constantly increasing
throughout the Bureau.

Failure to Properly Execute Daily
' Reports and Number Three Cards

Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 2,
Pages 5 and 6, instructs that the primary purpose of number
three locator card is to show where an employee may be reached
at all times, and in the preparation of Daily Reports when
recording action performed in connection with a new case, the
title and classification followed by the word “new should be
inserted on the Daily Report.

A teview of Daily Reports (FD-28) submitted by
Resident Agents (RA‘'s) in the San Francisco Office disclosed a
number of instances wherein investigative activity was
performed in new investigative matters which was identified
only by the classification and the word "new",

Several instances were also neted in Daily Reports
wherein administrative activity was identified in the file
number column as "66=", “Admin” and “"66uAdmin", Other Daily
Reports contained a “O" file without further identifying data
to record investigative activity.

7 In the preparation of Daily Reports, it is essential
these forms ¢learly indicate the nature of work being performed
at any given time. The use of the particular RA's administrative
file number should be confined to those instances where the
mature of work being performed relates directly to the
administrative operation of the RA.

A review of No. 3 cards disclosed instances where the
location of informant contact and the location for lunch was
not recorded, It is recognized that it is not always practical
or desirable to show the exact address of the location an
informant is to be contacted, however, the general locality
of the contact should be shown and the location for lunch
should always be recorded.

You must insure that all personnel preparing both
Daily Reports and No. 3 cards are aware of the need to properly
execute samee .

Improper Administrative Handling of
Security and Racial Informant Files

awnefpiohes LARSON: During the inspection of the

San Francisco Office, a review
of files in the 134 and 170 classifications has disclosed a
number of delinquencies in the administrative handling of
these files.

It was observed that security informant reports
are being disseminated by use of the FD-306. ‘The informant's
true name is included in the report in accordance with
existing Bureau instructions set forth in the Manual of
Instructions, Section 107G, Page 9, Part 2a9. Some of
these reports also contained the true name of other symbol
number informants. In the latter instances copies of the
reports were channelized to the 134 administrative file
6& the informant showing the file number followed by the
symbél number; however, there was no channelization memoran-
dum for a file containing the true name of either the
informant furnishing the information or the other informant
mentioned in the report. Due to the fact copies of the
reports are not being designated for a file under the
true name of the informants, the identities of all
informants mentioned in the reports are readily apparent
to anyone reviewing the 134 file or any of the 100 case
files to which copies of the reports are channelized.

It is essential that the identities of all
informants be kept on a need to know basis and that they
be afforded maximum security. In order to avoid the
possibility of disclosing the identities of informants
through your channelization procedures, 100 dead files
should be opened under the true name.of all informants in

your office and copies of reports reflecting their true
names should be channelized to these files. In addition
to affording greater security to the informant, this
procedure will alleviate the necessity br designating
copies of the reports to the informant's 134 administra-
tive files and thus avoid placing unnecessary information
in these files. The channelization memoranda placed in
the 100 case files for informants should be destroyed in
accordance with instructions set forth in the Manual of
Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 3, Page 15,

Part m2. ‘

With respect to racial informants it was noted
that the name of the informant is placed on the pink
sheet (FD-377) where it is only necessary to show the
serial number where his name appears in the file. It
was further observed that in many instances reports of
both security and racial informants are not being properly
authenticated. Bureau instructions are that the informant's
code name should appear immediately below the last line
of the report rather than at the bottom of the page. In
addition, there were several instances of failure to
indicate on the FD-306 the date that the report was
authenticated by the informants. H

Examples of the above delinquencies are located

there is a real need for all personnel conducting these
investigations to change their administrative handling
of informants and information received from them. You

INFORMANT CONTACTS

INSPECTOR A LARSON: Manual of Rules and Regula-

tions, Volume 4, Section 107,
page € (4a), captioned "Contacts by Agents," sets forth
instructions regarding the contacting of security informants.
It points out except in espionage and foreign nationality
matters where frequency of contact is dependent on circum-
stances, informant should be contacted as often as necessary,
but at least one personal contact should be made every two
weeks. If such frequent contact cannot be established,
specific Bureau authority should be obtained for the exception
to this requirement.

While reviewing files during
this inspection, it was noted that many of the FD-208s con-
tained in the cccurity informants’ files showed distinct
lapses of time beyond the prescribed period of time. As
examples, the below-listed cases failed to indicate that the
informant had been contacted in accordance with the above

requirements, These files are as follows: |
: 134-3784 170-324
7 134-3740 ' 170~368
at 134-4368 170-371

134-3232 170-506
134-3037 - 170-513
134-2237 170-576

In view of the critical need
for quality security informants in the Bureau's operations,
the frequency of contact is important not only to continue
the rapport developed between the Agent and informant, but
to insure the informant is given sufficient assignments to
insure that his potential ‘is exploited to the fullest. It
is essential that the FD-209 reflect the proper dates of
contacts in order that the close continuous supervision can
be afforded this important phase of Bureau work.

IMPROPER MAINTENANCE OF
157-0 (RACIAL MATTERS) FILE

insPactoR/gk OLD C, LARSON: A review was made of the 157-0
(racial matters) file during
the course of the current San Francisco inspection. This
file contains several serials which pertain to telephone
numbers which were called from or was used to make a collect
call to the Black Panther Party (BPP) headquarters in
Oakland, California. These serials contain the identity
of the subscriber of the telephone number and further contain
instructions that investigation should be conducted to
establish if Subject is involved in BPP activities and con-
sider Subject's potential as a racial informant.

Examples of the above-described serials are located
in the following serials:

purpose of filing nonspecific information, This undesirable
trend of filing serials with leads to conduct investigation
contained thereon should be terminated. If investigation is
to be conducted, a case should be opened and assigned and

The above tabulation indicates there has been
a delay in opening cases in addition to the delay in
conducting investigation in these matters.

This is a highly undesirable trend and corrective
action should be immediately instituted to prohibit delays
of this type in this important phase of the Bureau's work.
The Black Panther Party is a violence-prone, black militant
organization and individuals connected or associated with
this group should receive prompt investigative attention.

The FBI Handbook, Part III, page 154D, instructs
that black nationalist extremists represent a threat to the
internal security of the U.S. and the investigative guide-
lines in the Manual of Instructions, Volume III, Section 87D,
concerning security investigations of individuals apply to
them. General guidelines concerning black nationalist
mate app in the Manual of Instructicns, Volume IV,
Section 122. You should make certain that all personnel
handling investigations concerning racial matters are
completely familiar with the instructions as set forth in
the Manual of Instructions, and aeons are handled
pursuant thereto. :

careful evaluation will
be made as to the adequacy of your Agent complement. Tabulations
have been separately requested (work paper 4-L) covering fluctuations
of Agent personnel complement, case load, case closings, and delin-
quency for the past six months and this information should be care-
fully considered by you in preparing your response.

Set forth the Agent complement which was approved at
the time of the last inspection.

How way Agéuts have you been able tc divert to higher
priority work as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70
in ITSMV and Deserter matters?

If you feel your Agent complement is adequate but not
excessive, you should so state, If you have any surplus of Agent per-
sonnel you should specify and explain. If you feel additional Agent
personnel should be assigned to your office, you should so state and
completely justify by tabulations and other factors which you think
pertinent.

: Add any other comments you feel are pertinent and as the
last sentence of your answer set forth your Agent complement as of
close of business on closest Friday to date this inspection commenced.
Refer to Section 6-M of the Inspectors' Manual for instructions as to
inclusion or exclusion of Agents under transfer, resignations, etc.

SAC GEBHAR ae carefully reviewed the detailed study
REG;hko_ | made and tabulation set forth under 4-L of
(10728770)$ the work papers. The workload in this office,

and particularly the important nature of the
increased workload, has steadily increased in the recent past
and there is no indication that this trend will change in the
near future.

Agent complement at the time of the last
Inspection was 229, excluding, of course, the Agents assigned
to the Defense Language Institute, Monterey. As of 10/16/70,
Agent complement was 256, excluding those at the Language
School. As of 10/16/70, four Agents were under transfer into
the Division and one was under transfer out of the Division.
A total of 4-1/2 Agents were diverted to higher priority work
as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70 in ITSMV
and Deserter matters.

As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware, the
Bay Area of San Francisco has the greatest potential for violence
in the entire United States. The headquarters of the Black i
Panther Party is located in Oakland. In-addition, there are q
seven Black Panther community centers and a large number of |
Black Panther pads in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In addition to the Black Panther Party, there is
a hard core group of militant, violence-prone New Left organi-
zations and individuals centered in this area. It is known there
are many persons in the area who are either Weathermen or espouse
the violent, militant doctrine of the Weathermen. In addition,
there are 262 individuals who have been connected with the
Venceremos Brigade living in this area and, as the Inspector
and the Bureau are aware, the Revolutionary Union organization
has numerous members in this area. This office and the present
complement of personnel have been and are making every effort
to’ fulfill its responsibilities with respect to the activities
of these violent militant groups. Since May, 1970, an additional
17 men have been added to handle these important responsibilities.
It is felt, while we are making headway, one of the prime thrusts
in our investigations of these violent groups is the realization
of the absolute necessity to develop live quality informants
within the inner core of such groups so that we can anticipate
their future activities. .

a Balad Ssara STP e——— 273,



As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware, a
Russian Consulate will be operational in San Francisco in the
immediate future. Already four members of the Consulate have
arrived in San Francisco, including the Consul and Vice Consul.
It is known three of these four individuals are KGB agents.
There is every indication that, while they do not have a specific
physical building as yet, they are already conducting business
to a certain degree out of their hotel and apartments. Our
responsibilities in this regard have already increased and, as
soon as a physical building is established, our responsibilities
will increase tremendously.

As indicated previously, this office is making
every possible effort to fulfill its responsibilities with the
present complement of 256 Agents and will continue to do so,
since this office does recognize the over-all needs of the
Bureau with cespeci to the assignment of the Agent personnel.

ADDENDUM (tig 4 During the inspection a careful

» INSPECTOR’ ARNQ! LARSON: evaluation was made as to the
LLL sn d adequacy of your agent compliment
ETYELYET bearing in mind the case load,
cases closed, delinquencies and types of cases assigned.

It is fully agreed that the San Francisco Office
is the hub of the Black Panther Party operations which
ereates potential for violence. It also has a concentration
of New Left and violence-oriented individuals and is a
center for Selective Service violators. These along with
your other responsibilities draw, heavily upon your manpower.

Your division has a unique situation with respect
to Selective Service cases. As of September 30, 1970, your
office had pending 2,257 cases in this classification. In
analyzing these it was determined that many of these require
very little investigation and 1,163 are either under indictment
or awaiting proseoutive action of seme type. (A special
write-up has been prepared concerning Selective Service Act
eases for streamlining procedures) In analyzing the Selective
Service case load of 1,111 pending cases vequiring investigation,
approximately 50 percent are in headquarters city. There
are 16 men assigned to these investigations for an average
ease load of 34.4 of cases.
In an effort to determine the average case load of
this office in categories other than Selective Service,
a computation was made by eliminating the Selective Service
Act cases and those agents handling (2,178 pending active
and 27 agents as of 9/30/70). It was determined that the
average case load for the remaining agents was 32.5. This
computation for the proceeding five months reflected the
following:

August 1970 average cage load. 32.7

. July 1970 32.5
j June 1970 : 31.1
: May 1970 31.9
: April 1970 7 34K
ATS,



@

5

With respect to the work load of the individual
squads, the following is called to your attention for
consideration in diverting personnel to assignments where
manpower is needed:

Squad 4, the case load remained almost constant
during this period (539 cases in April, 530 in September)
and one agent was added to the complement. :

.

Squad 5 pending active case load declined from
655 cases to 508 cases or 16 per cent while the agent
complement remained constant. As will be noted, the average
case load is approximately 29 and the type of cases handled
on this squad do not appear to be complicated or involved.
The percentage of cases closed during the period averaged
39 per cent per month, ESE -

Squad 1U case load was analyzed for the period
from December, 1968, through September, 1970. The case
load as of the first date was 692 cases with 16 agents.

At the latter date there were 773 pending active cases with

22 agents. : : :

In addition, it is recommended that maximum
utilization be made of the Special Clerk program to relieve

- Special Agents for higher priority assignments. One Special
Clerk is’ recommended for the Berkeley Resident Agency for
record checks. It is suggested that you explore the use of
Special Clerks for checking Selective Service records in view
of your vast volume of cases of this type. Consider Special
Clerks for complaint duty and monitoring. :

You should constantly re-evaluate your manpower
situation and make adjustments where necessary to insure
that the Bureau's interests are being fully carried out.
Divert manpower to priority assignments and make necessary
adjustments through your re-evaluation and realignment to
insure that the work load is equitably shared, priorities
emphasized and any deficiencies corrected, Keep the Bureau
fully informed concerning your manpower and all requests
for additional manpower will be fully and closely scrutinized
in light of your potential for accomplishments, efficiencies
in administrative and investigation operations and the
demands placed upon the Bureau through expanded jurisdiction.

ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL — 6-M-2
CLERICAL 7
ue
INSPECTOR Ne: Set forth tabulation of the clerical

complement of your office showing
separately total number of employees assigned to each of following three
categories: "Chief Clerk's Office, ' "Stenographic Personnel" and "Clerks
not Available to Chief Clerk's Office, " plus overall total of your clerical
staff. List complete titles and grades involved and in listing Investigative
Clerks indicate whether at headquarters city or if at a Resident Agency, so
identify (see Format page 2). In mentioning resignations or in referring
to employees in the military or on maternity leave, extended sick leave or
special assignment to another division, identify employee by name, title
and ieee and state whether such personnel have been replaced and, if so,

Describe additional positions established since last inspection and
state whether filling of same was from approved complement or necessitated
hiring additional personnel, In any category where there has been an in-
crease or decrease set forth a specific explanation, including whether au-

_ thorization for increase was based on such things as (1) need to replace

employee on maternity leave or extended sick leave; (2) increased work
load; (3) June overhiring; or (4) transfer in to relocate employee. Where
there are increases cite Bureau communications authorizing such increases.
Reconcile any differences between your assigned personnel complement
(total clerical employees shown on tabulation) and your "authorized" com-
plement (total clerical employees approved at the last inspection - plus or
minus any changes since authorized by the Bureau).

1 Third column of the tabulation should include only those vacancies
you have received authority to fill or that you intend seeking authority to
fill.

If you feel your clerical complement i is adequate but not excessive,
so state. If you have any surplus of clerical personnel you should specify and
explain. If you feel additional clerical personnel should be assigned to your
office, so state and completely justify by tabulations and other factors which
you think pertinent.

that time has increased from 5,312 cases to 9,024, for an

increase in work in the Chief Clerk's Office and additional
administrative procedures in the Chief Clerk's Office brought
about by new programs, such as NCIC, New Left, bombing matters
and racial matters, have attributed to increased work in the
Chief Clerk's Office. There has been a measureable increase of

reproduction of stenographic material which is handled by

the Duplication Unit of the Chief Clerk's Office.

In line with economy measures, consolidation and

file destruction, this office has remained constantly alert
for streamlining procedures which would insure the clerical

staff being kept to a minimum and still discharge our many

responsibilities in an efficient manner.

However, it is felt

that an increase in the Chief Clerk's Office complement is

necessary to efficiently handle the continuing responsibilities
and increasing work load. In line with this, it is felt that

the complement of 82 should be increased to 92.
Agent-clerk ratio would be minimumly increased from 66% to

69.9% on the basis of a full authorized clerical complement.

If this increase of 10 clerks were authorized, their services
would be immediately brought to bear by utilizing two in our
indexing unit, one for closed and one for pending; three would
be used on rotor units, noting there is a heavy increase in
work in racial matters, New Left matters and on the civil
rights rotor; four of these clerks would be utilized in closed
files, primarily for indexing; and one would be utilized in
consolidation, stripping and destroying files.

Due to streamlining procedures utilized, such as
duplication of certain material from the stenographic pool,
it is felt that the present complement of 63 stenographers
and typists can handle the present work load. While this
figure is adequate, it is in no way excessive.

The complement of clerks not available to the Chief
Clerk's Office has increased from 22 to 24 from the last
inspection. A review of these positions indicates each to
be essential to the over-all discharge of our responsibilities
in the technical field. The increase of two clerks was due
to the authorization of two Special Clerk positions by Bureau
_ letter dated 8/10/70. These positions are deemed essential
The personnel assigned are adequate and there is no excess.

ADDENDUM /7, ae :
. INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON: At the time of the last Inspection
10/29/70 ¥’ ‘ your clerical complement was

fixed at 168. This would include
-82 in the Chief Clerk's Office, 63 in the Steno Pool and 23
Clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's Office.

Since that date there has been an increase of one
in the number of Clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's
Office. This was due primarily to the increase in the Special
Clerk Program. :

: It was noted that a request has been made for an
additional 10 Clerks in the Chief Clerk's Office. This matter
will be considered further at the Bureau and you will be advised
of the results. It is noted, however, that you are 6 under your

authorized complement in the Chief Clerk's Office. An analysis

| of your turnover of personnel in the Chief Clerk's Office during
the past two years reflects that your complement has averaged

6 under authorized strength almost constantly. Every effort
should be made to bring your complement up to strength.

: It is agreed that the present stenographic complement

clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's Office (24) is adequate
but not excessive. It should be noted, however, that elsewhere
in the Inspection Report you have been encouraged to utilize the
Special Clerk Program to its maximum to make Agents available
for higher priority assignments. This should be done and it is
believed that any clerks taken from the Chiéf Clerk's Office for
this purpose should be replaced.

The ASAC has the responsibility cca clerical
recruiting.

The Applicant Coordinator is SA Harold
Leggett.who handles the coordinating Ske
¥ecruiting of both clerical and Special Agent
Applicants. It has proven to be a full-time
job in an office the size of San Francisco.
In view of the existing competition between

', Government pay scales and those of private

indusivy, comstant recruiting efforts ars
necessary to maintain theclerical complement
of the office. He should be continued.

Prior to 6/1/70, San Francisco had assigned to
clerical recruiting one Special Agent in
Headquarters City plus the Applicant Coordinator.
We also had one agent who spent approximately

50 per cent of his time recruiting, handling
interviews and processing clerical Applicants.
These agents are engaged in the same capacity

of Applicant recruiting today.

The following agents all from Headquarters City
were assigned on a part-time basis on Applicant
Recruiting prior to 6/1/70:

Brent .T,_ Palmer, whose present duties concern

.

To reinstitute our clerical Applicant
Recruiting Program, should the necessity
arise, we would recontact our many sources
of clerical Applicants and make known to
them that we are once again actively
recruiting. This would include sources in
not only Headquarters City but also in the
RA territory. We would also consider
utilizing Special Agents on a part-time basis,
in both Headquarters City and RAs to meet
the needs of the Bureau.

Public and parochial high schools are our most
productive sources of qualified clerical
Applicants.

Individual assignments have been made throughout
the division designating an agent as a liaison
representative with each public and parochial
high school as well as business schools and
eclicges.

Also the Applicant Coordinator as well as other
agents appear at high schools on a constant
basis for career type speeches and serve on
career day panels.

San Francisco had a clerical applicant quota of 16
for the period July,'1969, through May, 1970 (at which time
the quota was removed). During that period, 12 clerical
employees entered on duty .at the Seat of Government. Your
quota was met or exceeded during 5 of the 11 months. It is
to be noted, however, that since May, 1970, 15 additional
clerical employees have entered on duty from San Francisco
as a result of your recruiting efforts expended during the

quota months.

Rmaetrree tere rer rere Aals



Even though quotas have been removed, you should
continue recommending highly qualified clerical applicants
| and should continue liaison with sources in the event it
! becomes necessary to reinstitute an aggressive clerical
recruiting program on a very short notice,

Since June, 1969, 16 Special Agents have entered on
duty from San Francisco. By teletype dated 9/23/70, you were
advised that New Agents' Classes were being scheduled on a
weekly basis beginning 10/5/70, and effective 10/14/70, each
office was placed on a quota of one Special Agent per week.

You are reminded that applicants who possess a four year

resident college degree may be considered for the position

of Special Agent provided they possess one year of executive,
administrative or investigative type experience. Noncommissioned
officers may be considered provided they have at least two

years of military service. .In addition, clerical employees

who possess a four year resident college degree may be considered
for the Special Agent position upon completion of one year

of continuous Bureau service.

It is imperative that the Special Agent recruitment
program be given top priority and every effort should be made
to insure that there are a sufficient number of available
applicants processed so that your quota of one Special Agent
per week will be met without fail.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM
DESIGNATION OF ROTOR H
NUMBER ON FILE JACKET

ee Oe Ae During the inspection of the

“ San Francisco Office, it has
been observed that several pending files failed to contain
the rotor or desk number on the file cover. In those instances
where the rotor number has been placed on the file cover in ink,
it is often small and hard to read.

To facilitate the routing of pending files by
clerical employees to the eleven rotors throughout the
San Francisco Office, it is suggested that the rotor number
be placed on top of the file jacket with a large stamp. You
should devise a system which would include maintaining a stamp
on each rotor and at the time a new case is opened the rotor
clerk should stamp on top of the file jacket the number of the
rotor which handles the particular pending ease.

The adoption of this system would allow not only
employees of the CCO to more expeditiously route pending files
but would also be of assistance to stenographic and other per-
sonnel when they are routing files to the various rotors
throughout the office.

This procedure would specially aid in the routing
of files where the classification is split between two desks
such as the 42-classification.

Comments of Chief Clerk and SAC requested.

CHIEF CLERK SIEVERIA:
10/23/70 mmo Taspector! Ss suggestion has merit and will

be placed into effect immediately.

INSPECTOR/ ARNOLD C. LARSON: This is a pending case, opened
ia on 3/16/67, assigned to SA
GERARD JAMES NORTON of the Richmond, California, Resident
Agency. It is supervised by SA RAY M. ANDRESS.

A review of this file reveals the Subject was de+
@lared delinquent by Local Board #30, Richmond, California,
on 3/9/67, for failure to report for induction on 8/17/66.
The whereabouts of the Subject have been unknown since 3/16/67,
and considerable investigation has been conducted to locate
him. Information was developed in March, 1970, that Subject
‘was possibly in Canada and a friend of Subject's mother advised
in September, 1970, that the Subject is in Canada, but that his
mother does not have an address for him. The Subject is re-
ported to telephone his mother on occasions. Other neighbors
- and police have reported Subject to be in Canada at the present
time.
In view of the above, the following action should be
promptly initiated in an effort to ascertain the location of
the Subject: ig

1. Prepare a letterhead memorandum, ‘in accordance
with instructions set forth in the Manual of Rules and Regu-
lations, Part II, Section 4, page 14 (2) (a) I and SAC letter
#70-27, dated 5/18/70, in order that information regarding
the Subject may be furnished to the Royal Canadian Mounted

Extended investigation has been conducted since
inception of this case in the neighborhood of Subject's parents,
1132 South Sage Court, Sunnyvale, California. When case was
initiated, it was determined Subject's family had moved from
870 El Camino, Mountain View, California, the address shown on
Subject's DD 553 in 12/68 which was prior to Subject's
reported absence from the military in 4/69. Subject's
parents have appeared to be cooperative md although present
neighbors of Subject's parents are not well acquainted with
the Subject, they are cooperative and a neighborhood source
has been established.

Subject entered military service in 9/66 at San Jose,
California, at which time he was approximately 20 years of
age. Since initiation of this investigation, additional past
residences have been developed for Subject's parents at 278
Lassen Avenue, Mountain View, California in 9/63; 620 East
Mauded Avenue, Sunnyvale, California in 7/68 and 1390 Latham
Street, Mountain View, in 7/68. A neighbor has indicated
Subject may have a brother but could furnish no specific
information concerning his identity. Attempts to establish
residence at the Latham Street address have been negative.
Mail returned to the U.S. Army addressed to the batham Street
address indicated a possible residence of Apartment 101, 1617
Pine Street, San Francisco, California. Investigation has
also indicated past employment for the Subject at Channing

3. Conduct inquiry at Pine Street address in
San Francisco to develop background information
of possible assistance in this investigation.

4. Check records at Channing House, Palo Alto,
to determine if Subject formerly employed there
and for possible leads to associates of Subject,
such as listed references or indicated residences.

5. Conduct appropriate credit and criminal
checks at Palo Alto and San: Francisco.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

BOND DEFAULT MATTERS

eve iahen C. LARSON: As of 10/1/70, the San Francisco

Office had 48 bond default
matters under investigation. This volume of cases presents
a fertile field for increased convictions under the Bond
Default classification.

An in depth survey conducted by the Inspection
Division disclosed that there has been a significant
increase in cases received by the FBI for investigation
subsequent to the passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.
This Act liberalized bail and bond procedures in Federal
cases whereby subjects were to be considered for release
on their oWn pérsoiial recognizance or unsecured appearance
bond in contrast to previous procedures which required a
specific bond, creating an excellent opportunity for us
to achieve statistical accomplishments. The ratio of
convictions to the number of cases investigated in bond
default matters is one of the highest of any violation
handled by the Bureau.

One of our offices, namely San Diego, has been
responsible for the most significant portion of the Bureau's
convictions in bond default matters as a result of effective
liaison with the U. S. Attorney, who felt that an indictment
obtained under bond default was more easily proven than
the substantive offense. When a subject is apprehended,
the sentence is, in part, influenced by the U. S. Attorney,
who informs the court the length of time the subject's
apprehension has been sought by the Bureau. A number of
these cases have arisen through charges of narcotics and
smuggling of merchandise and aliens across the border.
Subjects were brought before a magistrate, and rather than
pleading guilty, subjects obtained a court appointed
attorney and entered a not guilty plea. They were released

- then on either personal recognizance or a minimum bond until

their scheduled appearance. When the subject failed to
appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, San Diego opened
a case, and usually within 30 days an indictment was secured
under bond default.

SAN FRANCISCO INSPECTION
10/23/70



Although San Francisco is not a border office,
it is a great port of entry, both by sea and air, and many
of the same type cases utilized by San Diego for obtaining
a bond default indictment should be available to San

‘Francisco.

As you are aware, convictions are becoming more
difficult to obtain because of the court's intérpretation
of the law in many classifications. Bond default matters
present an excellent opportunity to increase your conviction
rate, therefore, it is suggested that through your liaison
with the U. S. Attorney, point out to him the possibilities
for an increase in convictions under the Bond Default
Statute,

The necessity to establish effective liaison with
the U. S. Attorney in bond default matters was set out in
SAC Letter 70-13 dated 3/17/70..

If an increase in cases and convictions is obtained
as a result of this Suggestion Memorandum, advise the
Bureau by routing slip, attention Inspection Division.

‘Comments of Supervisor DE JEAN and SAC GEBHARDT

requested.

SUPERV 8 MORRIS M. DE JEAN: Close liaison will eontinue to

10/26/7 be maintained with the United States

Attorney's office and all avenues
of potential convictions will be

vigorously pursued to increase the statistical accomplishments
in the San Francisco Division.

SAC GEBHARDY:
“10/26/70 \W

On 10/8/70, 1:30 A.M., a bomb which had been placed
in the women's restroom adjacent to a courtroom in the Marin
County Civic Center exploded, causing damage in excess of
$150,000 to the restroom, courtroom #4, and the surrounding
area. This bombing appeared to coincide with bombings
occurring in the ROTC RuildAing at the University of Washington |
in Seattle and the National Guard Armory at Santa Barbara.
These bombings came two days after BERNARDINE DOHRN, speaking
for the Weatherman organization, warned of a "fall offensive"
by that organization.

A member of the night maintenance crew at the Civic
Center advised he noted a white male in his early twenties,
clean cut, normal dress in the area at 10:20 P.M. He also
noted a white female in early twenties inthe area on three
occasions between 7:30 P.M. and 10:30 P.M.

This case received wide-spread publicity because
it followed the recent kidnap and murder of Judge HALEY at
the same Marin County Civic Center. President NIXON commented
on these bombings at a news conference, indicating his interest
in the matter,

7/7/70, SA MILLER advised he had received information from
PAUL A. FOX, Terminal Manager, Lee Way Trucking Company,
Doolittle Boulevard, San Leandro, California, that the
above~mentioued tices were missing £. the company and were
presumed to be stolen. Accompanying the memorandum was an

three (3) leads for additional investigation. As of 10/27/70,
there was no additional information in the file to indicate
that investigation had been conducted.

SA SAMUEL A. MILLER: The Inspector has requested my
explanation as to why there was
a delayed investigation and/or reporting in this matter.
I am sorry it was necessary for the Inspector to call this
to my attention. My investigation failed to identify the
subject, and I have not yet dictated a closing memorandum.
In the future I will dictate more promptly.

Sf sorERvisor GLENN A. HARTER: SA MILLER is a very thorough and
experienced all-around, excellent
agent, who has done a very good job in obtaining statistical
accomplishments for this office in criminal matters. I have
specifically discussed this case with him, and he was aware
of the fact that it was delinquent. It should be noted that
during the last month and a half, a majority of SA MILLER's
time has been taken up with the investigation of two bank
robberies and leads in two civil rights eases, all of which
were treated as specials , and these factorc are, in part,
responsible for this delinquency. It is regretable that it
was necessary for the Inspector to bring this delinquency
to the attention of the office, and steps will be taken to
insure that it will not happen again.

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHAR I have urged the need for prompt
investigation, which did take

Agents' handbook, Part II, Page 12 and 12B,
instructs that at the beginning of an interview with any
known Subject of a Bureau case the Subject be advised of the
name and official identify of the interviewing agent and the
nature of the inquiry. The fact that the Subject was so
advised is to be recorded in the opening paragraph of the
FD 302.

‘

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED: i:

SA MILLER is requested to explain his failure to
advise the Subject of his name and official identity and the
nature of the inquiry and to record on FD 302 that this was
done.

Relief Supervisor LUEBBEN is requested to explain
his failure to detect this delinquency at the time he
approved the report on 9/3/70.

Comments of SA ANDRESS and SAC requested,

SA Cyr Tie email At the beginning of the interview at the
10/27/70 Humboldt County Jail, Eureka, California,
I exhibited my FBI credentiais to the
subject and advised him of the nature of the inquiry. I
‘apparently inadvertently failed to record this in the opening
paragraph of the FD 302 and on review of this FD 302 I
inadvertently failed to note this had been omitted from the
FD 302. Care will be exercised in the future to insure this
does not reoccur.

SA RICHARD. phe LUEBBEN: I was Relief Supervisor on Desk #6 in the

40/27/70 absence of the regular supervisor and due
to the exceptionally high volume of mail

handled by this desk I inadvertently failed to note the above

omission from FD 302 of SA MILLER dated 9/1/70 when the report

was signed out by me. Every effort will be made in the future

to avoid a repitition of this delinquency.

DM
SA RAYMOND MVANDRESS: In reference to the report of SA RICHARD GUY
ae ede MILLER signed out by SA LUEBBEN on 3/3/70,

SA LUEBBEN was one of the Relief Supervisors
during my extended sick leave during this period. SA LUEBBEN is an
experienced Relief Supervisor and supervises the desk in a very
efficient and commendable manner. Due to the exceptionally heavy
volume of mail during this time, he inadvertently overlooked the
omission in the FD 302 of SA MILLER. The importance of advising
Bureau subjects the identity of Agents and nature of interview will
be discussed with the Relief Supervisors periodically and will be

llowed closely ts insure this does not reoccur.

on 7/24/69, assigned to SA JEAN G. HUGHES and reassigned

on 12/8/69, to SA KENNETH W. SHEETS, Case is supervised

by SA ROBERT D. ROBY. :

Review of the file indicates the Subject together
with two other Navy deserters had lived in a hippie commune
in the San Jose avnea during August of 1969. Investigation has
determined that he has used narcotics and has associated with
hippie-type individuals until the present time.

During 8/70, investigation was conducted in San

“Jose and investigation determined that one JOAN BAUER was

also residing in a hippie fashion and was acquainted with the
Subject of this investigation as well as the other two Navy

- deserters,

On 8/13/70, JOAN C, BAUER was interviewed at which
time she stated she is employed at National Aeronautics
Space Agency (NASA), Ames Research Center, as a secretary
at Moffett Field, a Navy installation. During the course

-of this interview, she stated she was iiving with a male

individual in a common-law relationship. She had formerly
considered herself a member of a "family" of hippies
including the Subject and another Navy deserter, At the
time of interview she advised that the members of this
hippie "family" received mail at her address and the reason
for maintaining the address is to receive food stamps for
this hippie "family" living in a commune style. She stated
she occasionally picks up their mail at her home and admitted
on occasion taking the mail to them when she visits the
"family". This interview was conducted at Moffett Field.
The information concerning BAUER was orally disseminated

to the Security Officer, NASA, Ames Research Center, on
8/13/70.

San Francisco Inspection

The Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part 2,
Section 5, Page 7, indicates that Bureau policy under

Commission all pertinent identifiable, derogatory non-
subversive information relative to employees of the Executive
Branch of the government. This is normally accomplished by
including such information in letterhead memorandum form
and transmitting same to the Bureau for appropriate dissemination.

. BAUER, as required by existing Bureau instructions.

2. Supervisor ROBERT D. ROBY is requested to

Comments of SAC requested,

SA SHEETS: . 7+ JOAN C. BAUER advised at the outset

A : -- of the interview on 8/13/70 that she
could consider herself a member of the communal "family",

however, this became a matter of interpretation during the

course of interview and eventually she denied she was a member

of the "family" or commune, She admitted visiting people
connected with the commune and associating with them, even to

the extent of allowing some of these individuals to use her
address for the purpose of receiving mail and food stamps.

This matter was discussed at length
‘with Security Officer RALPH MAINES and JOHN VAN ETTEN, Head of
. Security at NASA, Moffett Field, California. They made no
‘‘statement as to what action they intended to take,

I realize now that I should have
also prepared a letterhead memorandum for dissemination to NASA
Headquarters in Washington, D.C. I regret not having dofie-so and
in the future will insure that such matters are promptly
disseminated.

' SF 87-31544
BU__87-110860

INSPECTOR ahd C. LARSON: This case was opened on 4/30/70

and assigned to SA FREDERICK A.
GROS. The case was supervised on the desk of SA GLENN A. HARTER
and was closed on 7/27/70.

By letter dated 4/27/70, United Airlines Collection
Manager, RICHARD H. GEIMER, San Francisco, made available the
original of three fraudulent checks payable to United Airlines
on the account of KENDALL H. LUTES, Plandome, New York. Two
checks were tor $50 and one was for $25. UAL advised they
were forgeries.

GARY EUGENE LEGO was subsequently developed as the

Subject when arrested on 5/8/70 at Newark Airport, Newark,
New Jersey for false pretense and possession of stolen
property. When arrested he was attempting to purchase an
airline ticket with credit card of K. H. LUTES. An NCIC
check revealed he was wanted by Lancaster County Sheriff's
Office, Lincoln, Nebraska. He was released on 5/11/70 on
$500 bond but failed to appear for a hearing on 5/20/70.

LEGO was subsequently arrested on 6/19/70 in
Minneapolis by local police while in a stolen car. Local

“ authorities held numerous warrants for LEGO and indicated
that they were going to prosecute him. The United States
Attorney's Office in Minneapolis declined prosecution on
6/22/70 and on 7/16/70, AUSA, San Francisco, also declined
prosecution in view of LEGO's incarceration on local charges
by Minneapolis authorities, and in view of the small amount

1 eH of checks passed in the San Francisco area. The case was

subsequently closed on 7/27/70.

- The original checks received from united Airlines
on 4/27/70 have not been returned to the contributor, it
being noted the 1-A envelope containing the 3 checks indicates
they were to be returned. It is further noted that the 3

checks in question were not submitted to the FBI Laboratory
for inclusion in the National Fraudulent Stolen Check File.

According to Part I, page 4 of the FBI Handbook
all documentary evidence shall be promptly returned to
the persons to whom it belongs upon conclusion of the case.

The file fails to reveal that the local San
Francisco police authorities were informed as to the check-
passing activities of GARY EUGENE LEGO in their jurisdiction
and that he had been identified as the alleged passer of
the 3 fraudulent checks cashed at UAL in San Francisco.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED:

’ OF SA FREDERICK A. GROS

Why he failed to submit the 3 original checks in
this case to the FBI Laboratory for inclusion in the

National Fraudulent Stolen Check File and why the 3 checks

were not returned to the contriputor, United Airlines, san
Francisco, California, when the case was closed upon the
declination of the USA's Office on 7/27/70.

Why he failed to contact the San Francisco police
authorities for the purpose of disseminating appropriate
information to them concerning this case for whatever action

deemed necessary.

OF SUPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER

Why he failed to detect the delinquencies concerning
the submission of the 3 checks to the FBI Laboratory for
inclusion in the National Fraudulent Stolen Check File, the
return of the original checks to the contributor in connection
with his over-all supervision of this case and the dissemination
of pertinent information in this case to appropriate police
authorities for any action they deemed necessary.

HW 55148 Docld:32989637 Page 475 315,



yh SA FREDERICK A. GROS: I neglected to send these checks
ay to the Laboratory when I first

received them, Later after the Subject was arrested, I did
not feel that it was necessary, since he had béen identified
and also since the USA had declined prosecution in this case.
In the future I will submit these checks when I get them,

and I am sorry this oversight took place and will correct

it in the future. I regret not returning the checks and will
in the future return all checks upon completion of the case.

Gf-soreavrson GLENN A. HARTER: I failed to detect that this
| delinquency existed, and in the

future, will exercise more care after a case has been closed
to insure that evidence is not retained in the file.

SA DOUGLAS R. AHLSwAWN*—the writer was of the
impression that the lead at Walnut Creek to identify a
telephone subscriber had been covered and reported at
the time the case was RUC'd on 10/15/70. The writer did
not have the file available as the RUC communication was
submitted from the Santa Rosa Residence Agency and was
therefore unable to make a thorough review of the file.
Steps will be taken to make certain this does not recur

out a telephone number at Walnut Créek was inadvertently
overlooked at the time the case was reopened and assigned

to SA AHLSTROM. Upon receipt of the RUC communication closing

that Tawasha had been contacted on two occasions relative
to captténed organization, once in April, 1970, and again
in June, 1970. The brief and negative information he
furnished did not resolve any of the original planned
investigation by your office in this matter.

San Francisco memorandum dated 6/23/70 reporting
the results of contact with Tawasha on 6/19/70 showed that
a future discussion was contemplated with Tawasha, relative
to captioned organization. San Francisco File 105-25846
indicates no other investigation has been conducted to date.
