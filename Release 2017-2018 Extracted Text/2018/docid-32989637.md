SUBJECT: ESTIMATED COST OF PROPOSED

EXPANSION OF. FOREIGN LIAISON

Please refer to the attached copy of a memorandum

I from Mr. Callahan to Mr. Mohr, dated 6/3/71.

points out that the proposed expansion of foreign liaison

(would result in an approximate cost of $1,083,000. In regard

to this matter, I must take what will be an unpopular position;

one which runs counter to the present trend.

Frankly, I do not think that what we are getting from

our foreign liaison offices warrants such a tremendous

¡expenditure.

We must face up to the hard realities in this

matter.

Specifically, I refer to the fact that, with the

exception of one office, we are operating on strictly a liaison

¡¡basis in foreign countries. We are not operational; therefore

the kind of information we receive, in the main, cannot be

considered high quality, firm, positive intelligence cata.

his is the kind of data in which the President is interested.

I recognize fully that there will be some who will

disagree with me, but as I follow and understand our foreign

liaison operations the more convinced

I am that what we

receive falls into four main categories, 1.e.,

lot sossre is information siven to us which is in the nature

'(2) we receive opinions of native contacts in the countries

Ifrom other nations;

(3) we receive what might be called "planted" information,

expressly material which our native contacts give to us which

they want conveyed via the FBI to the White House or other

pertinent nigh-ranking U.S. officials---information that

would serve the interests of their own countries; and

It is a matter of common sense to conclude that

we cannot develop hard, high quality, positive intelligence

ildby sending men

mended closing that office because it was clearly unproductive.

There is no reason to believe now that it would be any more so.

I The same is true of other offices.

It seems to me that the time has arrived to take a

-ESTIMATED COST OF PROPOSED

EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

The Director noted on the attached memorandum from Mr. W. R.

Wannall to Mr. C. D. Brennan dated 5/28/71: "What is estimated cost of this

if approved?E.".

The proposed expansion would require the assignment of an

additional 29 employees (15 agents and 14 clerks) to Foreign Liaison. It is

anticipated that we will not ask for additional employees but we expect to take

the number from the 851 employees (600 Agents and 351 clerks) in our fiscal year

197% request which begins on 7/1/71. The 29 employees if put on foreign assignment

will cost the Bureau approxima tely $100,000 additional. We have not provided for

such funds and if the project is undertaken, the funds will have to come from some

other source in our budget such as equipment. If we keep taking money from our

equipment item we will soon be operating with obsolete equipment.

The total cost of foreign liaison operations would be increased

by approximately $1,083, 000 on an annual basis broken down as follows:

(1) expansion of existing offices--$313, 680; (2) reopening of former offices

$315,502; and (3) opening of three new offices --$453,818.

This memorandum, with all ticklers attached (including

my own), is being sent directly to you

I am doing this in

order to prevent any gossip that might circulate around the

Bureau had I taken the ticklers off and routed them. This will

give you an opportunity to consider the entire matter and decide

at what time you want to release the tickler copies.

As you know, this memorandum is predicated on your state-

ment, written on Mr. Felt's memorandum of 6/10/71 to Mr. Tolson,

which reads;

"I would like to have from Sullivan a list of

foreign offices he would recommend be closed now."

This complex subject matter will be handled in three

stages: First, I will discuss the offices to be closed now, or

within the foreseeable future. These relate to the long-established

foreign liaison offices.

Second, I will discuss the liaison

offices which were opened during the latter part of 1970.

Third, I will make reference to the proposed expansion of foreign

liaison and the proposed opening of additional foreign offices.

FIRST STAGE

MADRID, SPAIN -

I recommend the closing of this office now. It was re-

1969.

Since that time the operational cost

has been $152,952.. The Legal Attache's salary is Grade 15, $25,867.

The Legal Attache

is Mr. V. V. Kolombatovic, whom I regard

as an

outstanding man.

However,

the work is simply not there and I

question strongly that what we have received is worth the cost

of operating this office.

I believe consideration should be given to transferring

Mr. Kolombatovic to head the office in Copenhagen, where the

Legal Attache is being recalled because of a security violation.

Re:

I realize that Mr. R. E. Potocki, Assistant Legal Attache in

Paris, has been recommended to be the Legal Attache in Copenhagen;

however, if this is cancelled it would mean moving only Kolombatovic

to Copenhagen, Leaving Potocki where he is, thereby keeping expenses

down.

(I am aware that Ambassador Hill asked to have an FBI man

assist him; that Mr. Hill is a personal friend oi President Nixon; and

that it is said he intends to retire soon. If the Bureau wishes to

base its decision on this I have no further comment to make relative

to this office.

THIRD STAGE

In regard to the Third Stage, namely the continued

expansion and creation of new Legal Attache Offices (such as

Manzla; Rio de Janeiro; New Delhi; Santo Domingo; Canberra,

Australia, and Kuala Lumpur), I am unalterably opposed, for

reasons stated.

By the same token, I am adamant in opposition to the

London, Caracas, Madrid and Tokyo.

VIEWS OF MESSRS.

BEAVER, DALBEY AND FELT -

I have read the comments of the above-named men. It

was somewhat more than mildly distressing and saddening to me

to observe the lack of objectivity, originality, and independent

thinking in their remarks. The uniformity and monolithic

character of their thinking constitutes its own rebuttal. While

I am certain it was not the intention of these important Bureau

OIIIcIals, who occupy unique roles, to create the impression

in the reader's mind that they said what they did because they

thought this was what the Director wanted them to say, neverthe-

less

it seems to me this is the impression conveyed.

It has been my experience that the Director certainly

does not want officials of the Bureau to try to guess what he

would approve of, but rather wants men to think a subject-matter

through and give their views, calling "a spade a spade," and

"letting the chips fall where

they may." The Director is fully

capable of deciding for himself among conflicting viewpoints.

To use any other approach is, I think, to render a disservice

to the Bureau.

This current situation reminds me that a number of years

ago it was pointed out that inservice training, as it then

existed, was oI very little, lI any, value to our field agents.

IAl1 the agents in the field knew this. However, when it was

Memorandum to

The

Director

Re:

FBI Foreign Liaison Program

called to the Director's attention a number of Bureau officials

went to great lengths to insist that there was nothing wrong

with

Inservice and that it should remain as it existed at the

time.

Change was opposed. The Director will recall the results

of this controversy, for there was plenty wrong with Inservice.

It had to be overhauled, and it was at the Director's instructions.

I am also reminded of a statement attributed to Tom Huxley

which, though uttered years ago, fits the present subject-matter

with rare exactitude.

Huxley said that, when faced with a

difficult problem, one should give up all pre-conceived beliefs,

notions, prejudices and desires to please, and sit down with

an open

mind before the evidence, and follow wherever it leads,

Ifor otherwise no worthwhile contribution can be made.

I do wish, however, to point out that I think Mr. Felt

made a useful contribution and a most valid observation when he

commented favorably on the Mexico City Office (and I share his

view), and concluded, "However, Mexico City is an operational

office, whereas the others

are not, and in my opinion this goes

to the

crux of the matter."

Of course it does, and we should

not lose sight of this major and decisive fact, or inundate it

with irrelevant words.

SUMMATION

-

To sum up, since the offices to which I have alluded

(in the first stage of this memorandum) were opened, we have

spent a total of $2,256,715, as

of 6/15/71. It

seems to me,

from the standpoint of

efficient administration, this money

can be far better spent in the domestic field, where our primary

responsibilities are and where our problems are increasing and

becoming ever more complex. I am sure none of us are wholly

satisfied with the way we are discharging our operational

responsibilities in all areas of the domestic field.

Further,

we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that our Legal

Attache positions are not the "plums" of the Bureau.

They

carry fine salaries, plus living allowances, opportunities

for foreign travel, et cetera. These positions do not even

Shoulder day in and day out.

The Legats know this better, it

seems than some of us here at the Bureau. How many Legats

have asked to return to the field down through the years? And

when a foreign office is opened we are flooded with requests to

90.

The "word" has certainly gotten around. The "plums" are

well identified.

Additionally, the evidence points to the fact that,

(because of racial conflict, student and academic revolution,

and possible increase in unemployment, this cour

country is heading

into ever more troubled waters, and the Bureau had better be

fully prepared to cope with the difficulties which lie ahead.

This cannot be done if we spread ourselves too thin and finance

operations which do not give us proper returns for the dollars

spent.

We all know that the taxpayers of this country fully

expect that the Bureau will give them the best possible return

for their tax dollar.

This is a truth which I think is most

(relevant to some of our foreign operations, and it is a truth

Iwhich we ought not to ignore.

In order to keep this memorandum reasonably brief, I

have not gone into all the reasons and into the many details

which I can and will turn to if it is considered necessary. I

am convinced that the offices I have discussed will not stand up

under any honest, impartial, searching, prolessional analysis,

from the standpoint of getting back full value for the dollars

spent, as long as these offices are liaison and not operational.

Also, we must be very carerul not to mislead the President into

thinking we can consistently develop for him, in volume and

quality, high level, hara, positive intelligence intormation.

It cannot be done on a liaison basis.

Lastly, I am not unmindful of the fact that the Director

pointed out that we could get along quite well without an

expansive domestic liaison

section and, therefore, he dissolved

it. Applying the Director's reasoning to foreign liaison, I

think certainly the conclusion is valid that we can at least

Ireduce it, with benefits to the Bureau.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

Wastes

Pursuant to the. Director's request, we have considered

various steps which could be taken to expand our coverage abroad

in order to augment our development of high-level intelligence of

interest to the White House.

There are areas of the world where

political and other developments would be of keen intelligence

interest and we have included some of these although we cannot

expect

that any substantial volume of data pertinent to the

Bureau's domestic jurisdiction will be developed.

Thus, assignment

of Agents to such areas would be almost exclusively for

the

purpose of developing intelligence.

We have also prepared an

outline of our present coverage involving 42 Agents and 47 clerks

assigned to 17 foreign offices. This outline reflects the changes

which were made during the expansion effected in December, 1970,

land is attached.

We believe that our coverage can be stepped up in our

existing offices by increasing the complements of our Madrid,

BetTer operation in Rio de saneiro, sons.

In addition, offices

R1o de Janeiro, Santo Domingo, and

Manila

could be reopened, thereby relieving pressure on Buenos Aires,

! San Juan, and Hong

; Kong, which are presently attempting coverage

on a roadtrip basis. New offices could be opened in Australia,

The office in

India, presumably at New Delhi, we ta fen an antirely new area

and give:. us access to information of U. S. interest concerning

India, Pakistan, and Burma.

The office in Australia and in

Southeast Asia would also relieve our office at Hong Kong which

presently travels to these areas and would permit intensification

of coverage in Hong Kong itself by the two Agents currently

assigned.

The additions contemplated above would involve an

increase of no more.

than

an 20 Agents plus an appropriate clerical

staft.

Before making specific recommendations concerning the most

productive locations in some of the areas considered, we believe we

should secure the advice of some of our experienced men abroad who

have worked in the areas and are intimately familiar with their

i potential.

We plan therefore, if approved, to consult selected

Legats by teletype on

a highly confidential basis.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

wiel

As discussed. in the attached memorandum

Wannall to

Brennan, 5/27/71, we have prepared specific recommendations for

expansion of our foreign liaison for the purpose of increasing

our production of high-level intelligence of interest to the

White House.

While we now have 17 foreign offices manned by

42 Agents, we suggest reopening of..

3 former offices;

of

3 new offices; and

addition of one Agent each to sopresent

offices.

This would result in totäl of 23 offices manned by.

57 Agents and 61 clerks, increasing present 89 personne]

overseas_ to 118.

It is our recommendation that the following changes

be considered: Add one Agent each to the following offices:

Beirut, to take over coverage in Turkey and Iran;

caracas,

to

permit more thorough coverage of the large roadtrip territory

to permit

increased

large case load; Madrid

to expand coverage in Portugal and

Morocco; Tokyo, to intensify coverage on Taiwan and in south Korea.

provide closer following of political developments and more prompt

coverage in this important area which is larger than the U. S.;

Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to relieve San Juan of roadtrip

and furnish prompt coverage not only of Dominican Republic but of

current political developments

in Haiti.

We suggest the following new offices be established:

Canberra,

Australia,

to cover Australia and New Zealand, reileve

Hong Kong of roadtrip, and give on scene coverage in huge area

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH

MOCASE (THE BORIS MORROS CASE)

Item number one in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum

3/5/70 discusses the case of Boris Morros (Mocase) •

BACKGROUND OF CASE

Boris Morros, a Hollywood motion picture

producer, was recruited by soviet intelligence in 1935.

1947 to 1957 he was operated as a double agent by the FBI. This

was an extremely sensitive counterintelligence operation involving

Soviet intelligence activities in the United States in which

vas deeru dee tated as a double gene operation into

Norros traveled behind the Iron Curtain for meetings with his

Soviet principals.

Information obtained by Morros from his Soviet contacts

was disseminated to interested agencies,

including the Central

Intelligence Agency. On January 25, 1957, Jack Soble, Myra Soble,

and Jacob Albam were arrosted in New York on charges of conspiracy

to commit espionage against the

United States.

PROBLEM WITH

On March 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated

infornation received fron Boris Morros to heads of the various

intelligence agencies

criticized the information and, in effect, characterized it as

"fabrication or the product of

a paper mill,

" which conclusion

Thad been applied to many similar disseminations in

the past from apparently the same source.

By letter of April 5,

1954, the Bureau informed

that it was believed that no useful

purpose would be served in making any future dissemination to

of infornation received from this source.

On April 9, 1954,

advised Liaison Agent Papich that he had been loosing into the

matter and there was no question in his mind but that his agency

had acted stupdly in transmitting such a

letter to the Bureau,

INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

Item number 10 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum of

3/5/70 discussed our furnishing leads to our Legal Attaches

(Legats) without advising Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

or requesting the Agency to handle the, lead.

The observations of Special Agent Papich in this

matter are broad and

general in nature. His presentation is

hinged upon the premise advanced by the Agency that "internal

security" cannot be separated from "counterintelligence,"

thereby necessitating our advising CIA of requests to our

Legats to have leads covered in foreign countries.

The Manual

of Instructions, Section 102, page 23, states CIA's responsibilities

include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and

dissemination of intelligence

information. CIA does not have,

among other things, responsibility for "internal security

functions."

.

In the absence of unusual situations,: we forward

investigative.leads pertaining to our cases in countries where

we have liaison coverage to the particular Légal Attache

concerned.

Through his contacts the Legat arranges for the

necessary investigation and

submits the desired information

according to our reporting needs. The Legat coordinates

this activity on a local level..

It is more desirable to have our representatives

request investigation abroad in order to achieve maximum coverage,

and to maintain tight control so we can insure that we fulfill

our responsibilities.

None. He do not believe, in light of the facts set

BUREAU OPERATIONS IN CUBA

me operated informants in Cuba during the period we had a

Logat Office in Havana and did not

coordinate our operations

with CIA or advise it we had sources there. It was noted that

after Castro came on the scene, approval was granted to turn

certain informants over to CIA. Papich also refers to a

Communist Party of Cuba (CPC) which dealt with the problem

or rhether a Havana source used in an intercept operation

between the Communist Party of Venezuela and the CFC should be

turned over to CIA to obtain complete coverage. We, of course,

bad no coverage of Venezuela. Bureau had not advised other

agencies of this source since we did not want Castro to uncover

any operational activities which might embarrass the Bureau.

The entire operation was later turned over to CIA.

CIA began its operations in Havana in 4/47 and in a

letcer to the Bureau, 4/28/53, regarding Havana informants,

NAME noted that CIA was not overly cooperative and that,

in fact, it was not developing pertinent information. At that

time wine met with the CIA representative in Havana who

admitted he was not getting any information concerning the CPC

and had no plans for any aggressive action in that field. For

this reason it was necessary for us to davelop our own coverage.

We instructed NAME

to ascertain from the Hatana CIA

representative information available to him concerning matters

of interest to the Bureau; however, he was to continue through

informant sources to obtain needed

information regarding security

Legal Attache noted that CIA

personnel in pLace had indicated they were previously aware

of the NAME case and were impressed with the extreme sensitivizy

of the case.

We furnished

this information to CIA headquarters

and on 5/7/63 CIA referred to the incident and stated that it

was a matter of serious concern to it, requesting that any

future dissemination outside Bureau or to the Legal Attache

'be coordinated in advance with that Agency.

This practice

was closely followed. The Director observed in January, 1964,

that he thought the

whole thing had been imaginary on

the part

of CIA which had been played as a sucker by wAME

The

Director added that no more time should be wasted on it, at

least until CIA restrictions were removed. We continued

to attempt to get the restrictions removed without success and

covered outstanding leads.

In september, 1964, an analysis of the case disclosed

that although thirty-eight separate investigations were opened

only

three foREGN agents were uncovered. Original allegations

Of EOREIGH intent to mount an espionage mission in the United States

could not be substantiated. This information, coupled with the

fact that CIA refused to make NAME

available to us rior

the purpose of resolving discrepancies, prompted a decision

transmitted by us to CIA on 9/30/64 that we were closing our

investigation in this case.

Mr. Papich commented in his memorandum of 3/5/70

CIA never has been satisfied with the efforts made by the

Bureau in this case. Our review indicates our efforts in the

matter were as full

and complete as possible under circumstances

where CIA refused to grant us access to the source, did not

respond to request for clarifying data and declined to remove

restrictions making it impossible to take necessary investigative

steps.

Should any question be raised in the future, we are in

a position to document our difficulties experienced

with CIA.

RECONMENDED ACTION:

None. Ne do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIP WITH CENTRAL

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

DISSEMINATION OF CIA INFORMATION

IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his

memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph

dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."

special Agent (sA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of

the

document Bureau dia not obtain CiA clearance to include CIA

information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested

agencies, including CIA. According to SA Papich, CIA never

made any

protest although it considered our action a violation

of the "third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did

contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data

obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data

was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to

characterize the past, including, communist contacts, of key

figures in the Dominican Republic. It was taken from the 1963

CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA telegrams dating back to 1961,

all of which were

previously disseminated to the U.S. intelligence.

community by CIA. No attempt was made in the monograph to

characterize ClA data as Bureau information and,

in fact,

this

information was attributed to "another Government agency," in

accordance with established procedures.

The so-called "third agency rule" provides that

classified information originating in a department or agency

will not be disseminated outside the receiving agency without

the permission of the originating agency. However, an exception

to this rule provides that the receiving agency may. disseminate

such data to other members of the U.S. Intelligence

of which Bureau is a' member, unless

the originating agency

Board (USIB),

uses appropriate control markings limiting its data to the

use of

the receiving agency only.

The CIA data used in the

Bureau monograph had no such control markings and our monograph

was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and

USIB members only.

SA Papich states

that we told CIA that we would not check the toll

also states that "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt

that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of

refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the

security of U.S. intelligence operations."

A review of Bureau files disclosed that a memorandum,

the instructions that it be given limited distribution and

handled in a manner so it would not be apparent it emanated

from the Bureau or a source within the U.S. Above memorandum

points out that DCID 5/2 has been controversial since its

inception (12-8-59) and the subject of differences of inter-

pretation.

We recognized CIA's coordination responsibilities

but, in this instance, were of the opinion there was no operational

angle and no necessity for coordinating dissemination of above

since we had previously given the information to CIA. This

memorandum recommended approval of a letter to CIA answering

•CIA's inquiry according to above. Director indicated "o.K."

and "It looks like CIA is throwing its weight around."

On

we directed a letter to CIA accordingly. As indicated

further contest this issue.

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES - AFRICA

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sam

Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations

Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,

CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to

• assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by

providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist

Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.

His memorandum added that ve told that agency the FBI had no

informants available because they were necessary for our own

operations.

He claims we took

the position since we saw no

benefit to

be gained by loaning an infornant on a short or

20ng

torm basis.

Ho statos that Cin could argue that as carly

as 1960 it had foresight to recognize the need for additional

coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,

we did not cooperate.

He refers to his memorandum dated 1/7/60

concerning this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Africa."

The memorandum referred to discloses that on 4/5/60

NAME

AND POSITION

•that communist organizations were rapidly increasing in strength

on the continent of Africa and 'that his agency. found

1. It most

difficult to establish effective penetration.

NAME

noted that

in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to

move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable

him to develop worthwhile sources.

He asked if the Bureau would

consider furnishing one of its

Negro informants or developing an

intormant in the Communist Party, USA for eventual use by CIA in

Africa.

Papich told AHE

that

if the Bureau had a good Negro

informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future

jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production. Papich

added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau

informant, have him'travel to Africa under some cover and still

be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist

colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion. NAME

said

he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give

consideration.

I. That most of the information in our letter to

letter could be interpreted as raising the question concerning

the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-

tion which was

summarized in our letter to fir. Nixon, and we

clearly indicated in our letter that the source was CIA. With

regard to any question being raised as to the quality of

CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to

Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader

of

the CIA reports - - that is,

that the information from CIA

popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and

Mr. Nixon's arrival.

Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he

was personally involved in demonstrations directed against

him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that

advance information from

our responsible intelligence agency

(CIA) may have been lacking.

The Third Agency Rule is intended to prohibit a

authority to do so, and we follow this rule unless there

are overriding reasons. With regard to our letter to

EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the

Virector Dy sA san Papich in his memorandum s/o/ru concerns

exchange of technical information with CIA, particularly as

it related to the technical surveillance field.

Papich states

CIA exhibited its equipment to us, but for many years we declined

to show any of our devices, with some exceptions. • He states

that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated

from time to time that the

lack of exchange was prejudicial to

overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied

we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA.

Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is

a good exchange by the Bureau and CIA.

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has

furnished the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use

or inspection.

They have also furnished technical manuals obtained

abroad and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of

some

of their operations abroad. Laboratory personnel have

been

attorded tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities and

equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded

training at CIA schools. As recently as October, 1969, CIA

afforded a briefing to Bureau personnel concerning SENsiTie

offered to loan us one of these units as well as afford oux

personnel training in the operation of the equipment.

(SENTET

DATE: 3/6/70

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief

that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.

Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich

to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy

of cooperation ve have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of

collecting positive intelligence in the United States. Papich

notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been

restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

political crises occur in some country. He points out CIA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-

lance coverage, development of informants and collection of

cryptographic material.

Papich"

cites two specific cases occurring

in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,

suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the

Attorney General.

Review of specific cases mentioned set forth

with Director's comments relative thereto being noted. Our

policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) ~ copy attached.

SAC letter calls for

guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingnéss to cooperate

with CIA.

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

CIA has repeatedly raised the issue in the past of

our coverage in the positive intelligence collection area and

we can reasonably expect similar issues to be raised in the

future.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

That we prepare a carefully worded letter to CIA

outlining policy and the basic elements of intelligence and

counterintelligence work affecting the United States and

forthrightly ask CIA if it is satisfied with the status quo

and il not what do they have to suggest as changes.

RE:

RELITIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

DETAILS:

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information.

He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve

to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters.

Papich

notes,

however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

field has been

restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased technical surveillances,

informant development

and collection of cryptographic material. According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem.

Papich cites two cases MAME

and

where CIA requests for technical surveil-

lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these

matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the

The Director's letter to NAME

noted that

after careful review it was felt that CIA should take this

matter to the Attorney General.

On October 21, 1969, a CIA official was told by

Special Agent Papich that inthe future CIA should transmit its

requests for technical surveillance coverage in the United States

to the Attorney General. This specifically covered the cases

Of MAME

and NAME.

The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,

changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate

international travel and in response to requests from CIA,

the

Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA

regarding

that Agency's operational activities in the United States.

On a memorandum reporting the

results of the conferences with

CIA, the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our

guard down as CIA has always outsmarted'us because of our

gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the

tIeld and Bureau offiçials results of the conferences with CIA

and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction.in

the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)

emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement

upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness

to

cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the

United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director

noted "I hope

there is no 'sneaker' in this.

Time will tell."

There has been

no renewed request from cIA for

technical coverage in the cases mentioned above,

nor has there

been any indication that such requests have been sent by CIA

to the

Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest

in the past in these matters, we cannot

rule out the possibility

the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired

coverage at some time in the future.

(B) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - OPCRATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES -- The Bureau recently completed discussions with the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding that agency's operational activitics in

the United States.

These ascussions essentially decit with CiA's assessarent

and recruitment of foreign intelligenre sources in the United States. Endlesed

for vour use is a lisi oi the ground rules which boch agencies nave accepted

as guidelines for effecting the necessary coordination. In order that you may

be adequately oriented in this matter, the tollowing baukground is set icrth.

The need for the ground rules is related to Cll's interesi in dereloping

positive intelligence sources in the Unired States and the necessity for

protecting the Bureau's jurisdiczion in the counterintelligence field, The

latter is essential to the adequate aischarge of our responsibilities to

national security.

Positive intelligence may be described as a comprchensive produci

resulting froni collection, evaluation, collation, chalysis, and intespretation

of all available intormation relating to national security and concerning other

countries where such information is signiticant to our Co: ernment's realm-

ment and execution of plans: policies, and courses oi action.

Such intelligence

can be divided into various categories, suen as cronolnic, military, scientific.

political, geographic, st cerera. The collection ot positive incelligenor is

distinguished from counterintelligence which is primarily designed lo pendate.

Directives. There is no law, directive, or charior which authorizes Cie in

United States. Therefore, in the absence of any statutory prerogative to conduc

such activity in the United States, it nes been mutually agrced by FBI and CIA

that the Agency can only engage in the clandestine developrient and harding ef

positive intelligence sources in this country by coordinating with the Boreat.

of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to

bring about the necessary coverage. A good exaniple is our involvement

in the development oi information relating to the crisis in the Dominican

Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be "gray areas"

of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to

effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the development of positive intelligence in this

country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected

overtly through the review of foreign and domestic publications, interviews

of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this

area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive

intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity for a

clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is

this true in the development of positive intelligence sources who are

employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States

or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years he Bureau has had a continuing prugram of

developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging

our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for developing

positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in

formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA s need for sources in the

positive intelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources in

the United States in a limited manner with the understanding that such activities

are fully coordinated with the Bureau.

and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished

the necessary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA

resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established

in January, 1964.

JEK ACt 6 (11 (B)

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA

as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be decided at the

observations and recommendations before notice is transmitted to CIA. A:

the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a

representative of DOD, CIA. I so, you should be guided by the enclosed

ground rules in any discussions, bearing in mind that the approval for any

particulai cperational autivity is to be made at Bureau Headquarters.

You should hold to the concept that the protection of the interna?

security of the United States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities

of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts

which you may have with CiA representatives. There is to be no interfere-ce

with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unforesee.

developments may create siuations not adequately covered by the ground sies.

You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth

complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been inforzied

by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be

interfered with, we cannot discount the results of past experiences stemming

from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reaso: io

believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. It is.

therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown of te

adherence to the ground rules. I emphasize that this is an area of activity

which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge.

You

should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Bureau

can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this

Item Number 38 in the material submitted to the

a sort of summary in which SA Papich indicates that he cannot

recall the names of other cases which resulted in CIA displeasure

or criticism, but does cite one instance "early in the 1950's"

In which we disseminated data from a source of unknown reliability

charging Allen Dulles as having been a communist and a spy

while in

Europe.

By letter 3/22/52, we informed State and CId that a

source of unknown reliability had alleged that IDEAFgaG

had been arrested in Hungary in 1947 or

1948 and forced to vrite a letter to his wife which brought her

to Hungary where she was also arrested. He asked for an

evaluation of the information.

that it was not that important,

to drop the matter.. General Smith (then Director of Central

over channeling of information and Bureau made every

effort to stay out of dispute. In late 1952, for example, Helms

inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed.

(HERBERT HOOVER COMMISSION - 1954)

Item number nine in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954.

According

to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau had furnished

the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.

Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wise) was Chairman of the

Senate

Investigations Subcommittee.

General Mark Clark headed the Task Force which

surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55. In 10/54, CIA

alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop

said he had given Clark information relative to alleged communist

Clark the names of those considered security risks but ClA

investigations relative to character, reputation, and. loyalty

of individuals mentioned as security risks.

source of the information set forth in our letter. The last

paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the

impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that

CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles

concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter

also stated as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi-

vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your

arrival in a particular country. Therefore, there is a

question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist

organizations which would have led to the development of

information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of

your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding

instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958.

The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director

had a discussion with. Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as

first sentence of

the above letter reads as

follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set

forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

reports received from them on May 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to

Mr. Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mx. R. R. Roach. to

Mr.

A. H. Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for

the Director's information. The Director noted on this memo-

randum, "Send summary to A. G. H." In accordance with

instructions, a letter was sent to the then Attorney General

under date of May 16, 1958, and this letter contained a summary.

of CIA information in the same manner.as had been sent to

Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958.

Our letter to the Attorney General,

however, did not contain any observations regarding.CIA

coverage in Latin American countries visited by Mr. Nixon and

As indicated above,

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

who was a member of

Mr. Nixon's staff in 1958 and who is now a Deputy Director

of CIA, was aware of our 5/16/58 letter and its contents.

We have no information that CIA ever registered any type of

protest in this matter.

3. That CIA technically could raise a question

as to violation of the Third Agency Rule as regards our

5/16/58 letter to Mr. Nixon.

The Third Agency Rule is intended to prohibit a

Government agency from disseminating information originating

with another Government agency in the absence, of specific

authority to do so, and we follow this rule unless there

are overriding reasons. With regard to our letter to

Mr. Nixon dated 5/16/58, we set forth information clearly

identified as having originated with CIA. This letter

was apparently prepared at the specific request of then

Vice President Nixon after conferring with the Director.

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief

that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.

Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich

to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy

of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of

collecting positive intelligence in the United States.

Papich

Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been

restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

political crises occur in some country. He points out CIA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil

Lance coverage, developmen pich aformants and collection of

cryptographic material.

cites two specific cases occurring

in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,

suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the

Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned set forth

with Director's comments relative thereto being noted. Our

policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) - copy attached. SAC letter calls for

guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingness to cooperate

with CIA.

DETAILS:

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no! law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve

to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters.

notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

has been

restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development

and collection of cryptographic material.

According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem.

Papich cites two cases (Alfred S. Gonsalves, 10/69 and

Zalman Shapiro,

10/69) where CIA requests for technical surveil-

lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these

matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the

(B) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES - The Bureau recently completed discussions with the Certal

Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding that agency's operational activitics in

the United States.

These discussions essentinily dispit with CiA's assessment

and recruitment of foreign intelligenca sources in the United States. Enclosed

for your use is a list o1 the ground rules which doth agencies have accepted

as guidelines for effecting the necescary coordination.

In order that you may

be adequately oriented in this matter, the following background is set forth.

The need for the ground rules is related to ClA's interest in developing

positive intelligence sources in the United States and the necessity for

protecting the Bureau's jurisdiction in the counterinteiligence field. The

latter is essential to the adequate dischage of our responsibilities to

national security.

Positive intelligence may be described as a comprchensive product.

resulting from collection, evaluation, colation, analysis, and interpretation

of all available information relating to national security and concerning other

countries where such information is significant to our Government's develop-

ment and execution of plans, policies, and courses of action. Such intelligence

can be divided into various categories, suen as economic; military, scientiac.

political, geographic, et cerera. The collection of positive intelligence is

distinguished from counterintelligence which is primarily designed to penetrate.

monitor; neutralize and/or disrupt the foreign intelligence and security services.

Counterintelligence further includes other functions of an internal security

nature directed againsi subversive groups, crganzatious, and indiviquais. By

law CIA does not have any law enforcement or internal security funcuons CId's

authorization for collecting positive intelligence is predicated on the National

Security Act of 1947 and subsequent issuance oi National Socurity Couneil

Directives. There is no law, directive, or charter which authorizes Cié i

engage in the clandestine development of positive intelligence sources in the

United States. Therefore, in the absence of any statuory prerogative to conduc:

. such activity in the United States, it has been mutually agrced by. FBI and ClA

that the Agency can only engage in the clandestine developrent and handling of

positive intelligence sources in this country by coordinating with the Bureau.

The Bureau in turn legally has the primary counterinielligence resconston?

in the U. S. and is continually developing poultive inteligence, It, however,

must be regarded an incidental product to our main objective.

The Bureau

does not have a primary responsibiary to collect positive intolligence: but we

do have numerous and very signiacant obligations in this fieid..

in actua: practics

the Bureau is required by the President and other agencies to develop informatic:

of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to

bring about the necessary coverage.

A good example is our involvement

in the development of information relating to the crisis in the Dominican

Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be "gray areas",

of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to

effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the development of positive intelligence in this

country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected

overtly through the review of foreign and domestic publications, interviews

of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this

area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive

intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity for a

clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is

this true in the development of positive intelligence sources who are

employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States

or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years the Bureau has had a continuing program of

developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging

our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for developing

positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in

formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA's need for sources in the

positive intelligence field,

and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished

resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established

Dear Mr. President:

FoReigN

GONCRAL

In reference to our discussion concerning the serious inter- :

national situation and the need for more intelligence information of a high

quality, I have analyzed our coverage abroad.

We presently have eleven liaison offices located at Bern,

Switzerland; Bonn, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Hong Kong, British

Crown Colony; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Mexico City, Mexico;

Ottawa, Canada; Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Tokyo, Japan, statied by

twenty-eight Special Agents.

With your approval, we are in a position to increase our Agent

complement abroad by adding one man each to our offices in Paris, Bonn

and Rome, and tvo men to our oince in Buenos Aires. We are also in a

position io;

establish pew offices atytel Aviy, Israel; Saigon, Vietnam;

(Caracas,

We feel the new ofices, which we recommend be established,

are desirable in view of the current crises in the Middle East and Vietnam

which are subject to momentary escalation, and the recurring critical

situations in Central America and South America. An office in Helsinki

would present the advantage of having a listening post close to the Soviet border.

We are giving further consideration to expanding our domestic

coverage and to the possibility of additional expansion abroad for the purpose

of producing information in the foreign intelligence field.

the Middle-East situation, involving Israel and the Arab

nations.

We will be opening an office in Israel.

We need

Pursuant to the Director's request, we have considered how we

can increase our coverage for the purpose of developing high-grade political '

intelligence. We feel we should (1) increase the scope and size of our

presently existing Legal Attache (Legat) operations; and (2) open several new

offices in selected strategic areas. We will, of course, explore opportunities

to supplement our production of intelligence by increasing domestic coverage

on diplomatic establishments of countries of particular interest where we

feel it will provide information of the type desired. Our foreign coverage

can be stepped up by assignment of 15 additional Agents abroad.

There are presently 28 Agents assigned to our 11 offices abroad.

We would increase complement in selected existing offices as follows:

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

Re: EXPANSION OF FBI FOREIGN

INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION EFFORTS

We have selected the six new locales for following reasons:

With respect to Tel Aviv, the Israelis have a most competent and

efficient intelligence-gathering network relating to the Arab countries and our

efforts would be directed toward enhancing the flow of strategic information of

this type to the U.S. In Saigon, Vietnam, there is an obvious critical situation

generating the development of political intelligence. We would also be in position

to develop on the spot the identities of Americans traveling in the area,

particularly those subversives who within our own country are working toward

the overthrow of our Government.

Caracas (Venezuela) is the capital of a country which has been a

prime target for Castro infiltration and subversion efforts. In addition, from

this strategic point we would be in position to develop political intelligence

regarding Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam.

There

are strong anti-American segments in all these countries working to deliver

them to Castro, Communist China and Soviet Russia. San Jose is located in

Costa Rica, the southern-most Central American country excluding Panama.

All Central American countries are presently covered as a road trip by Mexico

City Agent. Establishing San Jose as a Legat post would put us in the position

of having an office strategically located to report regarding countries which

are almost constantly in a state of rebellion and change. We would, of course,

eliminate the road trip out of Mexico in establishing San Jose as a Legat post.

La Paz is located in the country (Bolivia) where "Che" Guevara

was killed. It is strategic in its location in that it borders Chile to the south

where a communist regime is about to take over and Peru to the west which

is strongly anti-U. S. to the extent that U. S. interests are being confiscated.

Helsinki (Finland) is in a country bordering Russia and would give us a

strategic listening post in an area where there is a definite need for intelligence.

With respect to both Bolivia and Finland, however, we must be prepared to

encounter difficulties in establishing Legat operations because both governments

are oriented away from the U. S.

Expansion abroad would include the necessity of assigning additional

clerical personnel to certain existing offices as well as to the new offices.

Through past experience we know there is considerable high-level

political intelligence available within the U. S. which can be secured immediately

and with no risk through coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments by

technical surveillances. During past crises, such as those relating to the

Middle East, Panama, Dominican Republic and Cuba, we have been able to

produce especially significant data through technical coverage of selected

establishments.

We recognize that should we expand our foreign coverage, certain

problems would arise in view of Central Intelligence Agency and State Depart-

ment interests in this area. However, we do feel the Bureau could provide

information through the expansion outlined above which would be of benefit to

the President and that any objections which may arise from other agencies can

be overcome.

ACTION:

(1) If approved

, attached letter will be sent to the President advising

him of extent of our present coverage, expansion of our current offices, and

establishment of additional ones as outlined above.

(2) If approved, we will submit our recommendations with regard

to expanding our technical coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments

within the U. S. for purpose of producing the intelligence required by the President.

(3) If approved, office of Assistant to the Director J. P. Mohr will

proceed to recommend the additional personnel described above.

(4) If approved, we will instruct all Legats to expand their current

coverage and to advise of their plans and recommendations for accomplishing

this.

SUBJECT:

THE LEGAL ATTACHE PROGRAM

The Bureau's Foreign Liaison Program has proved to be an invaluable

adjunct to all categories of FBI investigative activity, particularly in view of the

proven incapability, if not indisposition, of CIA and other agencies to adequately

service our requests for inquiries overséas, or even more important, to aggressively

seek the manifold information of immediate value to the Bureau which is available

through well-developed foreign sources. It is obviously important to locate Legal

Attache (Legat) Offices geographically and to staff them in the manner that will

accrue to maximum advantag of the Bureau. The purpose of this memorandum

is, at your request, briefly to analyze existing and potential foreign liaison coverage

from standpoints of both areas involved and personnel. This analysis will be

separated according to the three principal areas in which Legats are assigned:'

/""

Europe, the Far East, and the Western Hemisphere.

EUROPE

The Burgau at present has five Legat Offices in Europe: Paris,"

France;

London, H

; Rome, ItalyBonn, Germany; and Bern, Switzerland.

All offices

process a high volume of cases, but most of this volume consists of uncomplicated

matters which lend themselves to standardized -- almost mass production --

handling. Much more important than the number of cases turned over monthly

is the capability to develop sources who can handle Bureau inquiries immediately

and through whom new, pertinent, needed information can be received on a current

basis. In view of limited manpower, the main task facing each Legat is to exercise

great selectivity in airecting his efforts, eliminating all unnecessary and marginally

productive activities.

531244=2747.80

Paris: The Paris Office was reduced in complement in late 1967 from

3 Agents and 3 clerks to 2 Agents and 2 clerks.

The office is now staffed by

exceptionally competent people, both Agent and clerical. A heavy work load is

being handled efficiently and without undue strain. Legat Paris covers the former

Madrid territory (Spain and Portugal) and is able to handle work in these two countries

through 3-day road trips about every six weeks. The former Madrid Office had

been regarded mainly as a "listening post" and was closed in; 1963 because of low

volume of work. Conceivably, if work in Africa increased greatly (it is now minimal);

|re-establishment of the Madrid Office should be considered. Another possibility

(is reassignment of the Spain-Portugal coverage from Paris to Rome, still keeping

Paris-as a tagen

liaison with key Sawflerk office. This would permit further intensification of

es il theforimarily important areas of France and belgium.

Re: The Legal Attache Program

Rome: The Rome Office was cut in late 1967 from 3 Agents and 3 clerks to 2

Agents and 2 clerks. It is operating very smoothly with present complement and,

In fact, could carry a slightly heavier load. Legat Rome has substantially improved

the imperfect liaison which existed in its territory two years ago. Since 1967

road trip coverage of Turkey and Lebanon was discontinued as unproductive.

Coverage is now limited to Italy and Greece, with one-week road trips to Greece

made every other month. The cases developed from the Greece road trip are

very routine in nature, consisting mostly of matters gleaned from review of U. S.

visa and immigration files in Athens. Assistant Legat Theodore A. Korontjis, who

mainly handles liaison in Greece, has informally expressed his intention of requesting

Ireturn to domestic assignment when his present tour expires in 1970. It is believed

that a Greek-speaking Agent is not essential for the type of work currently existing.

Replacement of Korontjis with a Spanish-speaking Agent would permit assumption

Of Spain-Portugal coverage by the Rome Office, Which Rome work load could well

accommodate. Airline distance from Rome to Spain and Portugal is only negligibly

greater than from Paris.

London: Legat London's complement was reduced from 3 Agents and 3

clerks to 2 Agents and, 2 Clerks in late 1967. Work load is heavy but actually no

more so than that of Legat Paris, who had adjusted to the reduction somewhat more

gracefully. Continued attention to conscientious streamlining and selectivity and

economy in direction of effort can enable the London Office to function effectively

with existing personnel. However, if assignment of additional personnel to Legats

becomes practical, and especially if the Spain-Portugal responsibility were shifted

from Paris to Rome, London, of the 5 European offices could best justify a personnel

increase, and increase of clerical complement from 2 to 3 could be considered

warranted.

Bern: Complement of Legat Bern (1 Agent and 1 clerk) has remained

unchanged since the office was opened. Bern covers Switzerland and Austria with

very occasional trips to the tiny principality of Liechtenstein.

Bonn: Complement of Legat Bonn was reduced in late 1967 from 3 Agents

and clerks to 2 Agents and 3 clerks. Bonn handles work in West Germany and the

Netherlands.

Both the Bern and Bonn Offices are productive and well managed, but

do not have visible expansion potentials that would necessitate or justify

additional personnel. Bonn is in a position to release one of its & clerk-stenographers

whenever necessary during extended leave of employees in the other European

Offices. • The Paris, London, Bonn and Rome Offices are all capable, through

good management, of releasing their second Agent temporarily for relief duty

as necessary in the one-man Bern Office.

Re: The Legal Attache Program

FAR EAST

We have three Legats in the Far East: Tokyo, Japan! Manital in DaY

Philippines; and the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. All liaison in the

Orient was handled until 1961 by Legat Tokyo. The Manila Office was opened in

1961 and the Hong Kong Office in 1966 with appropriate allocation of geogaphic

responsibilities:

Preponderance of work in all three offices, and particularly in

Tokyo and Hong Kong, has been in the security category -- with main emphasis

on Chinese Communist matters.

Tokyo: In tate 1967 complement of the Tokyo Office was reduced from

2 Agentsland & clerks to 1 Agent and 2 clerks. Territory covered includes

Japan, Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Okinawa. The latter 3 areas

are covered by road trip of about one week at 2-month intervals. Solidly established

sources provide a wealth of information of value to the Bureau, which of necessity

at present is processed most selectively by the Legat. Sufficient potential for

further exploitation of sources in Japan and Taiwan exists to justify assignment of

a second Agent in event overseas expansion becomes feasible. Competence in the

'Japanese language, written as well as spoken, is important. Clerical complement

at Tokyo had been 3 until about 1965, when it was reduced to 2. The office has

operated efficiently through extensively streamlining with the 2 clerks, and can

continue to function with this complement although supply of relief clerks by Tokyo

to other Far Eastern Offices is difficult.

bAiY

Hong Kong,, Complement of Legat Hong Kong has been I Agent and I

clerk since time the office was opened. There are no road trips.

Limited potentials

in the nearby Portuguese colony of Macao, plus hazards of travel to that colony

which is so susceptible to Chinese Communist encroachment and pressure, have

militated against official travel there by Bureau representatives. British authorities,

in approving our opening of the Hong Kong Office, were adamant that we not conduct

liaison with Taiwan from Hong Kong in view of the sensitive balance of British

relations with Red China. This factor has precluded our consideration of shifting

coverage of Taiwan (which is located about half-way between Hong Kong and Japan)

from Tokyo to Hong Kong. Major work of Legat Hong Kong involves file reviews

and liaison within the American Consulate General, which is one of the largest

consulates in the world, having more personnel assigned than our embassies in

many of the smaller countries. Of much importance also is liaison with Hong Kong

Police, Headquarters and British Security Service (MI-5). Although Legat Hong

Kong was continually pressed the Bureau for assignment of additional personnel,

the existing complement should be adequate if efforts are applied by Legat with

maximum efficiency. Liaison is conducted 100% in English, which is the official

language in Hong Kong. Knowledge of Chinese is helpful in living in Hong Kong, but

is not essential.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: The Legal Attache Program

Manila: There is very little activity of interest to the Bureau in the

Philippines. Our office was located there in 1961 largely because of its central

location with respect to Southeast Asia. All liaison in the Philippines is

conducted in English, which is the official language. Spanish is virtually useless

and study of the native Tagalog, Ilokano and Pampanga dialects is impractical.

The Manila Office since its inception has had one Agent and one clerk. Because

of dearth of work in the Philippines and wide extent of the territory, the Legat has

spent a large proportion of his time "on the road," covering all of Southeast Asia,

Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Australia and New Zealand. Much of his travel to far-

flung countries has been necessitated in the past by requirement that Legat

interview FBI National Academy candidates being sponsored by the Agency for

International Development (AID. Case load at Manila has dropped substantially

during the past 16 months. Manila, Il any Far Eastern office, should be considered

for readjustment of territory. The small amount of work existing in Manila itself

could be handled without difficulty by Legat Hong Kong (one hour away by airjet).

A more logical spot for coverage of Southeast Asia might be Canberra, Australia,

or Bangkok, Thailand, both of which are more centrally located, have more

potential for expansion of FBI investigative interests and present a more healtful,

/ secure environment for clerical employees and dependents.

Vietnam: Another area of vital importance to the United States at

this time is South Vietnam, which heretofore has been considered part of the

Manila territory. Saigon currently is the seat of one of the largest U. S. Embassies

in the world in terms of personnel assigned, with enormous U. S. Information

Service, AID, and other auxiliaries. The CIA operation in Vietnam is by far the

largest it has

in the whole world. Although we have in the past had relatively little

case work in Vietram, unquestionably an FBI representative, if solidly accredited

to the Embassy, would be in a position to make an important contribution to the overall

effort through police liaison, and would at the same time serve as a valuable listening

post for the Director. In any expansion program it would therefore appear that

Saigon should be actively considered

Taiwan : As noted above, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has been

covered by Legat Tokyo. British attitude makes coverage of Taiwan from our

Hong Kong Office unfeasible. An alternative to increasing Agent complement at

Tokyo from one to two would be opening a new office in Taiwan,. from which the

Republic of Korea (South Kore a) could conveniently be handled

If this were

done, one Agent and one clerk at Taiwan would suffice. It would still be

desirable to retain two clerks in Tokyo, and with the reduction in territory the

in Tokyo, no at thee,

second clerk could be made available whenever required for relief duty in other

Far Eastern offices. On analysis, however, it would appear more desirable for

the Bureau to continue to cover Taiwan and South Korea out of Tokyo., as this,

assuming complement at Tokyo can again be established at two Agents, would

insure a source of Agent relief for the other Asiatic offices, at the same time

maintaining the economy of a more consolidated operation.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE

We now have 3 offices in the Western Hemisphere: Ottawa, Canada;

Mexico City, Mexico; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Ottawa: Legat Ottawa has operated from the beginning with only one

Agent, but with 2 or more clerks. Following the inspection in March, 1969,

clerical complement was raised to 3 and request of Legat for 1 additional Agent

was denied.. Legat processes an enormous volume of investigative matters (484

cases pending on 3/31/69; 282 cases closed during March, 1969), 99% of which

involve liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Although most

of the cases are stereotyped and are handled by use of form communications, the

very volume involved is greatly confining to Legat, limiting his availability for

personal liaison with the highly cooperative RCMP in matters of greater importance

to the Bureau.

For this reason, serious consideration should be given when

practical to assigning a second Agent to office of Legat, Ottawa.

Mexico City: Mexico City has a complement of 12 Agents and 12 clerks

(reduced from 15 Agents and 15 clerks following the inspection in February, 1969).

The office covers Mexico and five countries of Central America (Costa Rica,

El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Legat operates a large number

of informant nets in Mexico to provide intensive knowledge of potentially subversive

activities along the nathern border of the United States. Criminal investigations

involving border crossings are also numerous. During the recent inspection a

redixection of effort was ordered, to concentrate more fully on activities of

direct Bureau interest and less on matters where other U. S. agencies have joint

interest and responsibility. In view of this, it would not appear that increase in

personnel at Mexico in the immediate future will be justifiable 365

Buenos Aires: The Buenos Aires Office was opened 3/31/67 coincident

with closing of the Rio de Janeiro Office: Territory includes Argentina, Uruguay

and Brazil. Staft consists of one agent and one clerk, which was found to be

adequate during inspection completed 5/11/69. Work load is substantial, but

justification was not seen during the recent inspection for reopening the Rio de

Janeiro Office.

Other Latin American Countries: At present, no regular coverage is

maintained by the Bureau in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,

Paraguay, Chile and other South American countries. Experience has shown that

well planned, aggressive liaison does produce worthwhile results for the Bureau in

cooperative foreign areas. While disposition of some of the above countries toward

the United States has fluctuated, the necessity of maintaining a position of intelligent

defense against the inroads of communism in the Western Hemisphere is clear.

Re: The Legal Attache Program

Data is not available to evaluate potentials of each of the countries mentioned,

but if expansion abroad becomes practical in the future a careful survey to select

one of the countries named as site of a new Legal Attache Office appears desirable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Thạt observations of the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) and

Legats, Paris and Rome be obtained regarding desirability of shifting coverage

of Spain and Portugal from the Paris Office to theYRome Office. Their observations

should also be requested regarding future desirability of reopening the Madrid

Office to cover Spain, Portugal and, il necessary, nearby areas of Africa.

2. That a third clerk-stenographier be assigned to London when feasible.

GeNERAL

Mi, Beaver

In a notation on the attached routing slip of June 8, 1971,

to the Director from Mr. Beaver, the Director asked for my views on

the subject matter -- the expansion of the FBI's Foreign Liaison personnel,

offices, and activities.

I recommend the expansion for three reasons, as follows:

1.

The suggestion that we expand originated at the

White House, and was said there to be based on

the quality of information valuable to the President

that we have been able to provide. If it is the

judgment of the President and his Advisers that

this Bureau is able to provide unusually good in-

formation, and that they need more of it, we

certainly are in no position to deny or disagree.

It safely can be said that the people in the White

House know better than we the value of the infor-

mation which we have provided. I will trust their

judgment.

" lit seems hardly open to question that the President

of the United states needs good intormation of this

type now more than ever before. Political, economic

and social ferment abroad, all bearing on our foreign

relationships, requires more and better information.

This hemisphere alone is a good example. In the

past we have had sporadic trouble with one banana

republic or another but never before have we had

a combination of such difficulties as now are en-

countered in Cuba and Chile which have been taken

over by the Communists, and in several other

countries which are apparently on the verge of a

revolutionary change. If there is a chance that we can

help, we should try.

Re: Estimated Cost of Proposed

Expansion of Foreign Liaison

My limited experience with and memory of the

Bureau's S.I. S. operations during World War Il

convinced me that we should be able to produce

superior information. I was undercover in Chile

for one year and because of that experience, I

followed the S.I. S. operation with more than usual

linterest. I think the files will show that this Bureau

was greatly praised by high government officials

for its S.I.S. accomplishments. This leads me to

conclude that we can do a superior job again if need

The Director asked for my views on Mr. Sullivan's 6-page

memorandum, dated 6/16/71, arguing against proposed expansion of

our Foreign Liaison and proposing elimination of most existing Legal

Attache Offices either now or within six months.

Mr. Sullivan has not set forth any information which

causes me to change my position. Three important factors must be kept

in mind: (1) The White House requested both the recent expansion

and the proposed expansion; (2) what is of value to the White House is

political, economic and social information; (3) we are not attempting to

decide the question on the basis of "hard inteiligence." 'The White

House is not directly interested in Fugitives located, espionage

subjects identified and cases solved, which are what I think Mr. Sullivan

is talking about.

RECOMMENDATION:

That we proceed with the proposed expansion program.

the percentage of all files (pending and closed)

field average of 0.29%.

In pending files the percentage error was 0.12%

as compared to field average of 0.22%.

This is a very

ravorable comparison, however, the error percentage of 0.63%

in closed files is higher than the field average of 0.40%.

This would indicate that a closer review of files should be

made at the time of closing to insure that no further action

is warranted in those cases.

The subject of substantive errors should be dis-

cussed with employees of the San Francisco Office periodically

and all efforts should be made to eliminate errors such as

those set out above.

A 2.a. Communist Party (CP), USA

SF 100-11889

Bureau 100-3-23

The Northern California District (NCD) of the

Communist Party (CP) is comprised of 48 counties in central

and

northern California.

The westernmost of these counties

are

in the San Francisco Division; the easternmost are in

the Sacramento Division. Most of the CP activity in the

NCDCP lies in the westernmost counties, there being only ten

known CP members in CP groups in the Sacramento Division.

The CP maintains an office in Rooms 410-11, 942 Market Street,

San

Francisco.

• The CP continues to act as an organization, holding

CP club, club chairmen and district meetings.

Principal activity in the CP in the NCD consisted

of financing, preparation and distribution of literature

reflecting the national CD line, especially the "People's

World"

, the West Coast communist newspaper published in San

Francisco, and activities relating to recruitment of new members,

for example, the formation of the local Young Workers Liberation

League.

Informants are members of most of the CP clubs in

the NCD.

Some of these informants are members of committees

of the NCDCP.

number of them are officers in the various

CP groups.

The identity of the members of the CP in the NCD

are obtained from these informants who report on activities of

old members, transfers of members, recruitment of new members

and cessation of activity on the part of others. Within a

short time after it ocars, any change in the membership is

• reported.

Since 4/1/70, as an example, the informants reported

two deaths, 19 ceasing activity, Il moving out of the district,

three on leaves of absence, two resignations, one expulsion,

four new recruits, five reactivations, and two transfers into

the district.

It is felt that the informant coverage is adequate.

It will be noted there are 20 informants who are members of the

CP in the NCD and two informants who are not members but furnish

information primarily concerning CP activity. It will be noted

the informant ratio to membership is approximately one informant

for each 8.5 members.

When an informant reports on a new member in the

NCD, a case is opened and assigned to secure background data,

to report subversive activity, and to make a recommendation

as. to Security Index.

Source of funds are from dues, sustainers and

assessments of members; from sale of literature; from

proceeds of fund raising picnics, dinners, bazaars anc

similar affairs open

The main activity of the Socialist Workers Party

(SWP) and its affiliated youth group, the Young Socialist

Allance (IsAl, since the last inspection has been working

toward the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. In this

connection, they have been the motivating force behind massive

demonstrations in San Francisco on 11/15/69 and 4/18/70

protesting U. S. presence in Vietnam. They have also

sponsored

a petition which resulted in a referendum to be

voted on in San Francisco on 11/2/70 putting San Francisco on

record as being opposed to the war. The SWP is also in the

forefront of the Women's Liberation Movement, utilizing it as

a means of attaining the appearance of their political candidates

on college campuses

to speak on the subject.

When dealing

with youth, swe activity is carried on in the name of the YsA

but as the

YSA is completely controlled by the SWP, members who

comprise a majority of the YSA membership the name utilized in

public activity is irrelevant. Funds are derived from members'

sustainers, literature sales, and outside solicitation of funds.

Although constantly in arrears in rayments to the National-

Office of the SWP and the YSA, they do not appear to have any

financial crises at any time.

Informant coverage is adequate

at present but efforts will be made to develop additional

coverage to provide for continuing coverage

in the event current

informants. are discontinued for any reason. New members are

identified by member informants.

The membership of the SWP

in this area is approximately 99 according to member informants.

The membership of

the YSA according to member informants is

approximately 90.

RU publications describe RU as adhering to Marxist-

Leninist-Mao Ise-tung thought and advocating necessity of

armed revolution to destroy United

States imperialism and

establish dictatorship of proletariat. Members of leading

body, Political Committee, state all members armed.

75% to 80% advocated armed struggle now. RU going national

and has started collectives in Northwest, Chicago area,

Detroit, and in several major cities in East. Chief sources

of funds are membership dues and profit from sales of publi-

cations. RU publishes three newspapers and has significant

control

RU active

in strikes around the Bay Area, college demonstrations, and

in community affairs, tenants unions, welfare,

and education.

Increased emphasis being placed on weapons training and

affinity groups being organized for action in demonstrations.

RU members are identified mainly through live

informant coverage; fisurs and, where possible, photo

coverage of known RU meetings.

Additional names of RU

membership is self-identification in RU newspapers, and

coverage of RU communications bY SE 3240-5.

Estimate of

RU membership in Bay area based upon figure quoted to

member informant by RU Chairman in 9/70. Rapid membership

increase attributed to heavy emphasis on recruiting during

past year, less insistence on ideological purity in

recruitment and increased recruit potential caused by

breakup of SDS. While present informant coverage

considered adequate on overall RU activity, it is felt

member informant coverage should be increased on area

basis to identify individual members so they may be placed

on SI.

name

The Bay Area Progressive Labor Party: (BAPLP)

membership is made up primarily of individuals in their early

twenties.

The organization in the past held and is presently

holding classes on Marxism for potential members and for

further education of old members. The BAPIP is not holding as

many public forums and open meetings as it has in the past.

The BAPLP is active in the Students for a Democratic Society

(SDS) at the University of California at Berkeley, San Francisco

State College in San Francisco, and Merritt College, Oakland,

California.

The BAPLP has

a number of SDS sympathizers who

have aligned themselves with the PLP line and become BAPLP

candidate members.

The PLP is concentrating its main efforts

on student activities. This is the area where they hope to

recruit new members.

The BAPLP membership is estimated to be

between 45 and 50.

There has been no significant change in

membership since the last inspection. Some members have moved

out of the area and several have quit the Party.

The Party is

hopeful of gaining new members primarily from radicals on campus

and is having some success. Efforts are being made to secure

additional member informant coverage in the BAPIP. BAPIP

membership is determined through confidential informants.

approximately seven individuals on its Bay Area staff but has

held no meetings of a public nature.

2. Organizations:

The last Inspection coincided with the famous Students

for a Democratic Society

(SDS)

June 1969 Chicago Convention

In which the

then SDS leadership attempted to

expell the

followers of Progressive Labor Party (PL).

Ph controlled the

major local campus SDS chapters at the University of

California, Berkeley, and San Francisco State, Anti-PL chapters

of SDS existed for a

few months at Stanford University and

San Jose State College, but as SDS became less massive as an

organization controlled by Ph these members drifted into groups

such as the Revolutionary Union (RU).

Lack of communication

and organization, as well as a National SDS debt, constant

appeals

for funds, and continued ridicule by RU

and Weatherman

groups have all contributed to further dictategiation of sos.

Demands indigenous to the Student Movement have been ignored

to concentrate on PL's program of "Build a Worker-Student

Alliance" (WSA). At a western regional conference held at

Berkeley, California, September 26, 1970, SDS attempted to

rerorganize with delegates from throughout the west. Some

criticism of PL was voiced but Pli continued to dominate,

calling for a demonstration at San Jose, California, November 3,

1970, in support of striking auto workers.

SDS/WSA

funds available to print it, "New Left Notes"

at Boston but more regularly distributes "Challenge, Published

• publication

OF PLA

SDS/WSA

Western Regional Conference was only able to

raise $150 toward $5,000 National Office debt.

The Bay Area Peace Action Council (BAPAC) Is a

coalition of various anti-war groups in the san Francisco area

whose sole purpose is the immediatewithdrawal of all U. s.

troops from Southeast Asia,

BAPAC is not a membership

organization, however, the

Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Is a

controlling force behind it, simply because numerous SWP

members attend BAPAC meetings regularly. Funds are derived

from public solicitations.

The Student Mobilization Committee (SMC) is a

national organization of high school and college students

whose basic aims are the immediate and unconditional with

drawal of all U.S. troops from Souch Vietnam, abolition of the

draft, self-determination for Vietnam and Black America, and

HH 55148 DocId: 32989637 Page 181

Constitutional rights for GI's and high school students.

The majority of the individuals functioning in a leadership

capacity in the SMC are members of the Young Socialist

Alliance (YSA) and SWP.

Funds derived from sale of buttons

at demonstrations

public donations and support from ISA and

SWP.

The Venceremos Brigade (VB) of the San Francisco Bay

Area is affiliated with the national organization headquartered

at New York, New York, and is

principally active in the

recruitment of individuals for the VB sponsored contingents

to Cuba.

There are no local independent publications of the

Confidential

informants continually report a lack of

funding and finances.

There are no key activists directly

affiliated with the VB.

The

Newsreel in San Francisco was established in

May, 1968, as a branch of the New York Newsreel, a radical

film-making group.

Articles of Incorporation, pursuant to

non-profit corporations under the laws of the State of

California, number 58415, were filed In the Office of Secretary

of State, California, November 5, 1969. The Newsreel makes

and distributes films that depict ideas and information that

the Government and the news media tend to choose to ignore.

In the spring of 1970, the Newsreel began work on two new

films, one on the history of labor and the other on the

history of the women's liberation struggle. Persons who have

had some activity in the SDS and related

groups in other

parts of the United States have been some of the leaders of

the Newsreel in San Francisco.

The White Panther Party (WPP) in Berkeley is a

small group which seems to center its activities around

drug usage and communal living activity.

The group has never

been identified as a significant force in the radical scene

at Berkeley.

There are no Key Activists in the

Berkeley

group.

Recently, the WPP have been "hangers

on" at the office

of the underground newspaper "Berkeley Tribe".

The WPP of Marin County began in May, 1970. The

two leading figures among its 7 - 10 members

are DENNIS MARNELI

and RICHARD LORE STARK, both Priority I Security Index subjects.

To date, the group's major

stamps.

Activities of the WPP in Palo Alto currently are

being directod primarily hy Revolutionary Union leaders who

"live in communes with the WPP members.

The activities have

been limited to collecting weapons and demonstrating around

Lytton Plaza public meeting controversies.

WPP has announced

its intention to "blow up a pig station" but no action along

these lines have been evident to date.

These informants are impressed with the

While reporting news of interest to

(1) Of an estimated

several thousand communes in

Northern California, only a

small percentage of these may be

classified as political collectives organized for the purpose

of revolutionary violence.

The difficulty lies in identifying

these political collectives with the scant cooperation received

by the FBI and local police agencies from the alienated youth

sub-cuiture which engages in this commuial living.

Extended coverage has been given to those addresses

wherein the residents have been identified

as members of the

Weatherman faction of Students For A Democratic Society (SDS)

for the purpose of identiying members and locating fugitives.

Addresses which turn up in leads from other offices are given

short term coverage for the purpose of locating fugitives and

The addresses of communes which have been given extended

coverage over a period of several months because they are considered

to be political collectives are as follows:

During May, 1970, the final series of the Spring,

1970 campus demonstrations

occurred on the campuses at

Berkeley

and Stanford.

June and July, 1970 brought a number of bombings

and attempted bombings against off-campus institutions of the

establishment. It appears that several groups other than Weatherman

receipated in these bombings as Weatherman communication was only

regarding the bombing of the Hall of Justice in Oakland,

California, on July 30, 1970.

The months of August and September, 1970, were unusually

quiet with no demonstrations or bombings. It was not until the

fall offensive announced by BERNARDINE DOHRN, in the fifth communi-

cation from the Weatherman

Underground on tober 6, 1970, that a

new

series of bombings began.

The October 7, 1970 bombing of the San Rafael Courthouse

was claimed by the Weatherman and it appears that the other attemptec

bombings and bomb threats came from terroristic groups which respon-

• dod to Wetherman's call for a fall offensive.

7.

In response to bureau teltype, dated April 11, 1970,

the San Francisco Division advised by teletype dated April 20,

1970, that an additional 28 Agents would be needed with an addi-

tional seven Agents

for servicing of sophisticated coverage to

implement the intensified investigation against New Left violence.

In our teletype of April 20, 1970, it was indicated that the peak

number expected to be assigned to these investigations was 46..

As of June 15, 1970, a New Left Violence Squad was set

up in this office consisting of 24 Agents, broken down as to 17

Headquarters Agents and seven Resident Agents, of whom four were

exclusively assigned to the handling of New Left extremist matters.

One additional Agent is on transier to

the New Left Violence Squad

Based on current available manpower and the present

investigative demands on this oftice, it is believed that

the Bureau

program of intensification against the New Left has been implemente

up to this time.

However, in view of the new Bureau jurisdiction of

arson and bombing matters

• the San Francisco Bay Area who have accepted the hippie culture and

way of life among whom are the New Left extremists and fugitives,.

the task of locating, identifying, and apprehending these

individuals thus poses an extremely difficult challenge.

By airtel, dated September 30, 1970, the San Francisco

Division has asked for an additional 26

five will be assigned to the New Left Violence Squad, five will

be assigned to the squad hadling the Venceremos Brigade, six will

assigned to the squad handling the Revolutionary Union, and ten wil:

be assigned to handle the additional work load in the racial field.

D. ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS

1.

Espionage and related matters are handled on Squad 8,

which

is composed of a supervisor, L/ agents in headquarters,

and 4

resident agents.

As of 10/12/70, the case load was 742

cases.

In addition to Espionage and Internal Security responsi-

bilities dealing with the Soviets, Chinese and the Satellites,

this squad also handles various nationality groups, such

as

the Arabs, Iranians and Yugoslavs, and also handles the investi-

gation of the Revolutionary Union

(RU), which is the largest

Maoist-Marxist-Leninist organization in the Bay area openly

espousing the overthrow of this government by force and violence

and which is discussed elsewhere in detail.

This squad also

handles Mexican-American matters which are in their relative

infancy but appear to be trying to follow the path of the

blacks in their efforts to obtain more recognition for their

..problems:

The

foremost tasks presently facing this squad in

their order of importance are:

(1)

Coverage of the Soviet Consulate, which is in

the process of being established;

(2) Coverage of the RU;

(3)

Coverage of the Chinese, which has taken a new

turn subsequent to the Chinese government policy now of going

international and its recognition by Canada and the contemplated

establishment of a Chinese Communist Consulate in Vancouver;

(4) Coverage of Mexican-Americans;

(5) Coverage of soviet students (there are 7 in the

Bay area;

(6) Coverage of nationality groups, such as the Arabs,

Iranians, Yugoslavs, Cubans and South Americans, and

(7) Fisur coverage of other Soviet Intelligence

officials visiting this area, handling cases from other offices

and satellite programs and illegal agent programs.

With respect to the Inspector's comment on priorities,

I would like to suggest that serious consideration be given to

setting out priorities on situations before the fact rather than

waiting until the problems have become so serious.

Specifically

it is believed that the following serious and important matters

HY 5511

Dage 196

## Page 197

- 2 .

4-F-G

now basically in their infancy in San Francisco should receive

greater emphasis in determining the present overall Bureau

priorities.

(1) The Soviet Consulate. Four officials have now

arrived, including the Consul General Designate and the Vice

Consul Designate, and have obtained house-keeping apartments.

All indications are they are here to stay, to be augmented to

20 - 30 families when they locate their space. .

Three of the

Eour officials are known KGB and this fact should certainly

be meaningful to us.

Furthermore, in no time in this country's

history have our students, scientists and men in the Armed

let their moral standards

deteriorate to such a low

degree. Certainly the Soviets will capitalize on this

deterioration.

In addition, the San Francisco Peninsula

area is one of the most important centers of electronic and

scientific research in the united States.

Coverage of Chinese Espionage.

Within the past

week Canada has recognized Communist China and information

indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate will be opened in

Vancouver.. Already we have seen contacts between pro-Chinese

Communist elements in San Francisco and New China News Agency

personnel in Vancouver.

This, coupled with the recent indi-

• cation that Communist China is now ready to come out of its

shell and now concentrate on improving its international position,

will cause greatly increased

activity in the Chinese field in

this area.

(3) The Revolutionary Union (RU), which was only

founded in 1968, has grown from 1969 to 1970 from 120 to 350

members, according to estimates given by its Chairman in 9/70.

The development.OFthe-RU haa closely-paralleled recent

past six months has assumed a national posture with development

of collectives in the mid-west and East. At the Central

Committee meeting within the past week, 70 to 80% of the

delegates favored armed

revolutionary struggle now.

(4) Mexican-Americans. This field is in its infancy

but could prove serious inasmuch as revolutionary organizations,

such as the white radicals, are making determined efforts to

revolutionize and

recruit within the Spanish-American community.

As of the present, the most important Local group

iS LOS SIETE DE LA RAZA (The Seven of the Race), aka (SE f11€

100-63425).

This group was established in May, 1969, for

the purpose of obtaining adequate legal counsel for

the seven

Latinos charged with killing a San Francisco Police Officer

on 5/1/69.

The group was quickly taken over by militant,

radical Latinos who have guided it into more radical and

militant channels, with close ties to such groups as the

Black Panther Party, Revolutionary Union, Youth Internationaj

Party, etc.

It has

a newspaper,

"BASTA YA," and has expandec

its activities into such "community-oriented" work as a "People's

Clinic" and "children's breakfasts."

The second most important local group is the VENCEREMOS

COLLEGE (SF file 100-65241), located in Redwood City, California.

This is part of the NAIROBI College of East Palo Alto,

established in 1969, following the confrontation of Third

World students with

the College of San Mateo. AARON MANGANIELLO,

Director, of VENCEREMOS COLLEGE, was expelled from San Mateo

College as a result of this confrontation.

This college is primarily for young Chicano students,

and its stated goal is to produce

"revolutionary technologists-

doctors, lawyers, teachers." It is a two-year college, and

claims to be accredited.

MANGANIELLO states the directors

are Marxist-Leninist, and the class stressed is the political

education class in Marxism-Leninism.

Tuition is free.

Chinese Matters

Although the ethnic breakdown of the 1970 census is

not yet available, it is estimated by the San Francisco Public

Health

Department, that persons of Chinese descent constitute

approximately one-tenth of the population of the city. This

percentage has risen

constantly during the past two decades

and is expected to rise at an increasing rate in view of

liberalized immigration regulations and the tendency of certain

other groups to move out of the core city. The estimate of

approximately 70,000 Chinese residing in San Francisco is

matched by an equal number in other Bay area cities, making

the total Chinese population of the San Francisco Bay Area

sómewhere between 140,000 and 150,000 persons.

The report of the San Francisco Chinese Community

Citizen's Survey and Fact Finding Committee, issued in 11/69,

points out that the San Francisco Chinatown

is not simply ar

area but in fact, "a City within a City," with "its businesses

and commercial district, light manufacturing and industrial

areas, schools, churches and parks and its different housing

both public and private."

The fact that Chinese are

now widely dispersued throughout the city, Chinatown remains

crowded, with a population density about ten times that of

the city as a whole.

Although more and more Chinese are taking

up residence elsewhere in San Francisco, and in nearby cities,

most still retain Chinatown ties and many commute daily to

their businesses or offices in Chinatown.. All of these

considerations affect the investigation of Chinese matters

it has been found that the development of Nationality

Sources and the promotion of community relations is particularly

effective in the expeditious handling of Chinese investigations.

The San Francisco Office has sources in all of the

important organizations and groups in the San Francisco China-

town. Nationality Sources of this office serve on the board

of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, commonly

Perhaps the most important investigation in the Chinese

field at present is that entitled "Chinese Voice," IS-CH, which

appears to be shaping up as a major propaganda effort of

Chicoms. This investigation, discussed in more detail elsewhere

in this write-up, is expected to become more time-consuming, as

it appears that the

Two organizations at San Francisco that are considered

pro-Chicom are the Hai Yen She (M), commonly known as the

Petrel Club (Bufile 105-13332; SF File 105-869), and the Red

Guard (Bufile 105-189989; SF File 105-23956).

The Hai Yen She (M) is the descendant organization

of the Chinese-American Democratic Youth League which in the

1950's had a fairly extensive membership and

I was actively pro-

Chicom. At present the organization is "officially" disbanded,

but it remains an informal group of Chinese who are pro-Chicom

in sympathy and who hold weekly discussion meetings attended

by approximately ten persons. SE 2311=S is a member of this

group It is also noted that individuals

who are associated

with JOHN_S CONG and the

"Chinese Voice" include persons

who were formerly quite active in the Hai Yen She or its

predecessor organization.. MAURICE CHUCK (Bufile 105-19681;

SF File 105-1493), who was once Educational Director of the

Chinese-American Democratic Youth Club, is now the Managing

Editor of the "Chinese Voice."

The Red Guard grew rapidly in 1969, by absorbing

Chinatown youth gang elements.

However, adverse publicity

and the positive action of certain Chinatown tongs which took

action to absorb some of these youth and to place them under

so that no more than ten youths are now subject to the

Minister Information of the Red Guard, and its principal

leader, recently traveled abroad as a member of the Delegation

to North Korea and North Vietnam, led by the Black Panther

(BPP) leader, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER. Undoubtedly, this

travel, which included visits to Soviet Russia and to Algeria,

will make it even more necessary to cover HING's activity as

a Chinatown militant.

The Asian American Political Alliance, which only a

year ago was a center di Oiienial yIulesi activity at the

University of California at Berkeley, California, is now a

dead issue due to dissension in the Asian Studies Division

of the Ethnic Studies Department at that university. According

to SE, 2496-By a leader in these groups, the Asian Studies

group is divided between moderates who want to remain in the

university framework and radicals who want to organize the

Asian Studies Division into a community college, divorced

from university control and oriented toward community action.

This Asian Studies group maintains a community center in the

International Hotel at San Francisco, as well as the Chinatown-

North Beach Draft Counseling Center and Everybody's Bookstore,

-dealing in Chicom and New Left literature, in that same Hotel

building.

Regarding Chinatown gangs, it is noted that JACK S.

Hony who has been a source of this office, was the person wo

in Chinatown in directing a re-rganized war ching club asa

disciplined group in opposition to the Red cuard and the Asian

studies Group.

The recent recognition of Communist China by the

Canadian Government will certainly produce an increase in

"contact" cases.

At present this office has investigations

concerning persons reported to have been in contact with

Chicom business establishments and with the New China News

7.. Nationalities Intelligence Matters.

Although there has been no evidence of anti-communist

group activity which could be considered embarrassing to our

government, there does exist a potential among the Arab

students,

Iranian students, and the Yugoslav emigre groups.

Pro-Arab activity offering potential for illegal

activity and violence centers in Arab students on the several

Bay area campuses.

Their primary interest at present is to

support the Palestinian Arab cause. Demonstrations along

this line to date have been orderly and sentiment expressed

has been critical of both the USSR and Arab governments as

well as Israel and the United

States.

The Iranian Student Association has chapters in the

major colleges in the San Francisco Bay area. It advocates

the overthrow of the government of the shah of Iran. It is

also critical of U.S.

"Imperialism,' USSR and its cooperation

with the United States, and it supports the Palestinian Arabs:

It has sought and had

the support of the sDs in its demon-

strations.

Its demonstrations have been generally peaceful

except on one occasion demonstrators invaded the Iranian

Consulate and had to be forceably evicted by the police

department. 4l of them were arrested.

Among the Yugoslavs, the Ustashi element of the

Croatian group

have exhibited

bitter resentment to public

appearances at Croatian emigre social affairs by representa-

tives of the Yugoslav Consulate, San Francisco.

via their

weekly radio program they criticize the present communist

regime in Yugoslavia and strongly advocate a "free Croatia."

The Chetnik element of the Serbian group also voice

their criticism of the present communist regime in Yugoslavia

via their weekly radio program.

There has been no acts of violence perpetrated by

the Yugoslav group in the San Francisco Bay area.

They have

on two occasions formed picket lines in the vicinity of the

Yugoslav Consulate protesting the Yugoslav communist govern-

ment but on each occasion they registered same with the San

Francisco Police Department.

6. Deseco Program

San Francisco is aware. that the West Coast is of

increasing interest to the SIS, and the anticipated opening

of the soviei Consulaie has emphasize the need for the develop-

ment of an adequate pool of sources, informants and double

agents which will assist in our efforts to effectively cover

the intelligence activities of the Soviets.

To further implement the instructions of the Bureau

in this program, San Francisco has obtained from the Defense.

Supply Agency the identities of employees of industrial firms

who plan travel to or through Sino-soviet bloc countries or

who plan to attend an international meeting outside the U.s.

where Sino-Soviet-bloc personnel may be present.

These persons,

on a selective basis, are interviewed to alert them to the

possibility of foreign intelligence recruitment, and their

DESECO potential is then evaluated.

Other sources which have been contacted in an effort

to locate suitable individuals for development within this

program include security officers of major inaustriat Ilrms

and research faci tres stablished sources-employed by, aic-

Mexico, Central Anerica and South America,

and Argentina

persons who

might be used in a DESECO operation in South America.

The needs of the DESECO program have been furnished

to all Agents of the San Francisco Division in furtherance

of

the identification of suitable prospects for development within

this program.

to refund their registration fee.

goal of prosecution

Quality "member"

informant coverage in leadership position (in violence-oriented

groups on andoff campuses) is a prime and critical factor that

must be kept uppermost in the mind of responsible supervisory

investigative programs on a day-to-day basis.

Simply stated, "the name of the game is 'member informant

coverage' in all basic revolutionary and extremist groups" so

the Bureau will be in possession of advanced information on all

pertinent contemplated acts on the part of these groups and

the prosecution after the act. The Bureau cannot take "NO" for

an answer.

The above clearly points out the critical need for

in-depth member informant coverage in all of the above areas

In this regard, you should promptly make a thorough

of your security informant program, insuring that all

weaknesses therein are promptly corrected in order that optimun

informant coverage is obtained from available informants in order

that necessary informant coverage is obtained at the earliest

possible date.

BASIC REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

As reported by you to answers posed by the inspectors,

the activities of the Communist Party (CP) in the San Francisco

Division appear to be adequately covered by member informants;

however, you should insure not to lose sight of the fact that this

coverage can fluctuate daily.

You should insure that informant

development in this organization is not relaxed in order that

you will always have adequate coverage. A review of files relative

to New Left organizations and individuals reflects that your inves-

tigations in this area are conforming with existing Bureau instruc-

tions.

The one problem area indicated in the New Left extremist

type organization is the Revolutionary Union (RU) • ACcordingLy.

an

in-depth analysis was made of the problems involving this organiza-

• tion which is set forth as follows:

i.:

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

The RU has had an alarming membership growth from flIty

members at the time of the last inspection to 350 members at

present.

The growth of the RU has closely paralleled recent

directives from Communist China for a Marxist-Leninist organiza-

tion outside of China.

During the past six months, the RU has

assumed a national posture with the development of

collectives

in the Midwest and East.

At the Central Committee meeting

(governing body) held within the past week, 70 per cent to 80

per cent of the delegates favored armed revolutionary struggle now.

The RU in your territory is presently made up of 350

members in 41 collectives which are located in San Francisco and

seven Resident Agencies: Berkeley, Oakland, Palo Alto, Richmond,

San Jose, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz.

The extent of extremist activities such as those

adhered to by the Revolutionary Union and the

Weatherman

Faction of the Students for a Democratic Society is further

emphasized by the statements of MARK RUDD! Leader of Weatherman,

to

the extent that in 2/70, a meetingwas held in Clevelana,

Ohio, at which time Weatherman decided to go

undergrouna

and direct "strategic sabotage" not so much at Federal Buildings

but at military and police institutions.

One of the centers

of Weatherman activity was designated as

Berkeley, California.

Therefore, you should insure that aggressive and penetrative

investigation is directed in this area not only to identify

known Weatherman members but to locate and apprehend Weatherman

• fugitives.

In regard to RUDD's statement as to strategic sabotage,

the above stated acts of Violence indicates that Weatherman

in this area may be responsible for such acts, it being noted

that RUDD did not indicate any specific target other than the

sabotage was to be directed against symbols of the establishment

and particularly through confrontation with police and

accomplishing accompanying acts of sabotage through the use of

bombs

and other explosives.

In this regard, your attention is

directed to SAC letter 70-46 (F) dated September 1, 1970, cap-

tioned "New Left Movement-Violence-Internal Security-Miscellaneous

(Weatherman) which relates that recent developed intelligence

information unquestionably indicates the FBI, its field offices

and its Resident Agencies throughout the country are vulnerable

to the terroristic tactics of these madmen.. No office can

consider itself immune to such action;accordingly, you should

be constantly alert for same.

The foregoing emphasizes the importance of penetrative

aggressive investigation and the development of "member

informants" in

these organizations. It is further emphasized

by the activities of extremists throughout the U. S. who, during

the past academic year, were involved in excess of 1,785

demonstrations on college campuses:

During these demonstrations

over 7,116 individuals were arrested and damage to campus

facilities amounted to more than $9,563,000.

Approximately

300 police officers and 163 participants were injured during

these incidents.

Recently at the University of Wisconsin at

Madison, Wisconsin, a bombing caused one death and $3,000,000

damage to a building on the campus. During the period of

1J 55118 DocId-32989637 Pane 231

## Page 232

- 11 =

September, 1969 to August, 1970, there were 151 instances

of bombing

and/or arson.

Damages as result of these instances

amounted to more than $11,454,500. This compared to the 65

acts of violence, 503 arrests, 103 police officers injurea,

11 deaths and estimated damages of $961,443 in the

Francisco Division clearly crystalizes the problem that your

office faces in combating these

new left extremist groups.

You must insure that the Bureau's responsibilities in this

regard are fulfilled.

Stockpiling of Arms

and Ammunition

Your attention is directed to SAC letter 70-18 (C)

captioned "New Left and Black Extremist Terrorism-Bombing

Matters" dated 4/7/70, and the provisions of Senate Bill 30

relating to explosive incendiary devices and bomb threats.

The files of the San Francisco Office in: regard to

the stockpiling of arms and ammunition by extremists indicates

a need for a definite program set up by your office to insure

that you are aware of the theits of weapons ana other insisu-

ments

of violence with emphasis being placed on identifying

whether or not such weapons of violence are falling into the

hanâs of extremist groups.

In connection with the reported thefts of weapons

of violence you should insure that all informants (both

security and criminal) are promptly alerted regarding such

'thefts to aid in determining if any of these weapons of

violence are being sought after or stolen by extremists.

Counter-Intelligence Programs

A review of the San Fxancisco files 'in regard.

to the Counter-Intelligence Program of your office reflects

that serious imaginative and aggressive thinking has been

directed in this area with particular emphasis against

racial and Weatherman extremist groups.

An effective Counter-Intelligence Program against

basic revolutionary groups is a prime aspect in neutralizing

the potential of these groups.

Accordingly, you should insure

that this program continues to receive your close supervision

and direction in order that counter-intelligence can be

implemented where it will be most effective.

One such area

would be in directing your attention to violations of laws

under the Bureau's jurisdiction wherein the members are reportea

to be connected with extremist groups. In this regard, your

attention is directed to the Selective Service Survey (being

reported elsewhere in this inspection writeup) wherein it

is pointea out thai nine individuals were reported to be

affiliated

with extremist groups haing violated the Selective

Service Act. In this regard, you should insure necessary

administrative controls are set up so such indicated violations

are promptly brought to the attention of the responsible

supervisory personnel.

Security Index

A review of the overall operation of the security.

Index was made and it was determined that it is being maintained

in a current status in accordance with Bureau instructions.

It is noted that you do not have photographs for four Security

Index subjects and that photographs of 74 Security Index

ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS

With the signing of the Consular Convention Agree-

ment between the United States and the soviet Union, June 1,

1y64, negotiations have been conducted concerning the establish-

In April, 1970, negotiations

established authority for the Soviet Union to open a Consular

Office in San Francisco which will cover the states of Oregon,

Washington, California, and Hawaii, plus Kodiak Island and the

cities of Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska.

As you are aware, the Soviet Union previously had a

Consulate in San Francisco and Soviet personnel assigned to

this Consulate were extremely active in espionage activities

up to the time of its closing in 1948. With the establish-

ment of a Soviet Consulate in the state of California, a state

with a large ethnic Russian population, the Largest Communist

Party other than New York, and rife with extremist groups of

both the New Left anü Black Nationalist type, it is obvious

the Soviets are presented with unlimited potential for

successful espionage operations.

The area to be covered by

the San

Francisco Consulate is one in which are located many

key facilities and vital military installations, including

the Defense Language Institute, Monterey, California.

During the negotiations for the establishment of

this Consulate, it was contemplated that eight to ten Soviets

would staff this establishment.

It now appears the Soviets

contemplate assigning about thirty families to this Consulate.

• At present two Soviet officials have already arrived in San

Francisco area.

These individuals have previously served in

the United States and were connected with Soviet Intelligence.

The Soviets are presently in the process of establishing the

no the ted with soviet

Consulate and are seeking to purchase a building and other

equipment and supplies.

They are presently being assisted

by two Soviets assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington,

D.C.

on 10/27/70, an

additional Soviet arrived in San

Francisco, presumably to assist the above-mentioned Soviets.

At least three of these soviets are known KGB agents.

The need for daily and thorough investigative

coverage and close supervision of the above-mentioned soviets

and those who will follow is absolutely necessary and

expected.

The seriousness of San Francisco's continuing

investigative responsibility in covering all phases of

Soviet activities in San Francisco henceforth cannot be over-

emphasized.

. You must personally follow all pertinent develop-

ments in this matter on a daily basis. It will be your

responsibility to appropriately apprise offices covering the

tercitory of the Consulate relative to their travel to those

areas, such as LoS Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Portland,

Seattle, Anchorage and Honolulu Offices.

The thorough daily investigation of the activities

of the Soviets assigned to your Consulate is without question

as important as any investigative responsibilities you have.

The Bureau expects you to fulfill all phases of these

responsibilities in a thorough and exhaustive manner.

To date the actual purchase of a building which will

house the Consulate and anticipated living quarters for the

Soviats has not been made. Possibility exists that after

purchase is made renovations to the building may be

necessary to fulfill the overall needs of the Soviets. If

this possibility becomes a reality, the lapse of time in

completing such renovation may delay the arrival of the full

The San Francisco Office has been aware of the

possibility of a Soviet Consulate being established in San

Francisco for several years.

The Bureau has given you

numerous instructions in this regard.

In september, 1969,

Bureau instructed San Francisco to immediately institute

a vigorous campaign to develop a pool of suitable DESECO

sources for use against Soviet personnel.

At the present time you have three PSI-DESECo, two

of whom have been placed in contact with soviet-bloc ofticials.

In addition, since the last inspection you have opened 108

DESECO cases, closed 50 of them, and you presently have 58

pending cases. This is a distinct and worthy improvement

over the last inspection when you had 19 pending DESECO

In addition to the above DESECO potential, you have

valuable to San Francisco in its coverage of the soviet

Consulate. Agents handling these informants should remain

alert for

the appropriate opportunity in placing these

individuals in contact with the Soviets.

It is essential that you vigorously pursue an active

DESECO Program and insure that individuals are being developed

With the opening of the Consulate and the arrival

•I soviet personnel in your division, it is most essential

that consideration be given and efforts be extended to not

only evaluate individuals for potential defection but to

actively work toward inducing

a defection in place recognizing

that such

a source has proven to be the most productive

and positive means of penetrating Soviet Intelligence.

It should be expected that there will be an increase

of Soviet Intelligence official and non-official travelers

from New York, Washington, D.C. and abroad to the San Francisco

area.

It, therefore, would appear mandatory that increased

attention

and coverage be given to such individuals.

In addition the opening of a Soviet Consulate in

San Francisco undoubtedly will stimulate the increase of

Soviet Intelligence efforts in the area of your division,

This

fact will certainly necessitate the need for alertness on

your part to uncover this activity.

You must give consid-

eration to means to uncover such efforts by Soviet Intelli-

gence and be certain personnel working on Soviet cases are

experienced and qualified. Sufficient manpower and attention

must be given to all facets of these endeavors.

Soviet Bloc. Immigrant

(SOBIR) Program

Since the last inspection you have had 413 cases

referred to you under this program by U.S. Immigration and

Naturalization Service or other government agencies, and

you opened 89 of those cases and interviewed 26 persons.

At the time

Of the last inspection you had 337 such matters

referred to you, opened 89 cases and interviewed 16 indivi-

duals.

Because of the excellent potential in developing

worthwhile sources in this category in connection with the

coverage of the Soviet Consulate, it is imperative that you

scrutinize each SOBIR case to insure that all potential is

exploited to the fullest.

Visitors to Soviet-

Bloc Countries

Over 3,000 individuals in you territory have

traveled to Soviet-bloc countries since the lat inspection.

Of this number, you have

visited the soviet union. Of these to individuals it who

determined that one individual

encountered a recruitment

approach and no persons

were recruited.

This program should

receive renewed emphasis by your office in further develop-

ment of a wide variety of quality source coverage of the

Soviet Consulate.

Soviet Students

At the present time you have seven Soviet students

attending universities located in your territory.

Your

coverage of these students is through various sources, and

it is noted that you are continuing to develop additional

sources.

It is imperative that their activities be closely

followed, according.to existing Bureau instructions.

For

all practical purposes, these students should be considered

part of the Soviet Consulate complement.

event they are contacted by individuals of groups which may

be of interest to your office.

As you are aware, within the past week the Canadian

government has recognized Communist China and information

developed indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate may

be opened in Vancouver, Canada, in the impending future.

This

Consulate will certainly produce an increase in "contact

cases." It can be expected that many Chinese of the Chinese

Community in the San Francisco area will undoubtedly contact

that Consulate.

The Chinese Communist government will

undoubtedly be vitally interested in developing sources

among the

Chinese population in the San Francisco territory.

San Francisco has seen contacts between pro-Chinese Communist

elements in San Francisco and the New China News Agency

personnel in Vancouver.

This, coupled with the recent indi

cation that Communist China is now ready to come at of its

shell and concentrate on improving its international position,

will undoubtedly greatly increase activity in the Chinese

field in San Francisco territory. The need for developing

DESECO sources and quality Chinese confidential sources is

necessary and desirable if you are to fulfill your responsi-

bilities in this potentially critical investigative area.

Your investigation concerning the "Chinese Voice,"

a Chinese-language newspaper, clearly shows that this paper

is developing into a potential major propaganda effort of the

Chinese Communists.

Your investigation in this regara appears

• to be progressing satisfactorily.

SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM

The

Bureau has repeatedly stressed and the above

analysis emphatically points out the necessity of establishing

in-depth, quality informants in the racial and security field.

This fact is even more imperative now than ever before in view

of the present conditions throughout the United States,

particularly involving extremists as the upsurge of violence

is rapidly increasing.

The tiles of your sis and Psls have been reviewed

and individual

ratings have been prepared and made available

to you concerning each file. The ratings given the informants

are as follows:

Excellent

1794179905

The above informant that was rated fair is San

Francisco file number 134-971, Bureau file number 134-4238.

This informant should be closely followed by you for 90

days.

Specific assignments should be given the informant

during this

period.

However, at the end of 90 days if no

positive improvement is shown the file should be closed.

The Bureau should be advised of the action taken as to this

show othe

informant and whether or not he became productive within

the 90 day period.

In addition to the above a representative number of

the files relating to lot potential security informants under

development (non-Bureau approved) were reviewed. From the

ratings given the above SIs and PSIs (considering 23, SIs

are reporting on the Communist

Party) clearly indicates this

program needs revitalization within your division to fullfill

the needs of coverage on the extremist groups. Primary

weaknesses noted were made subject of separate memoranda relating

to failure to "contact informants" and the destruction of

channelizing memoranda.

Copies of these memorandan will be

found elsewhere in this inspection report.

Another weakness

noted in a review of these files was that informants did not

appear to be given sufficient, definite and varied assignments

in order to utilize and develop their full potential. It is

felt that through close

guidance and direction of informants

currently avallable to you, you will greatly increase badly

needed coverage in criticalareas.

You should insure that imaginative and aggressive

steps

are immediately taken in order that the San Francisco

Division has sufficient informant coverage in the security

field to meet and fulfill the Bureau's responsibilities

in this area.

You are reminded that in developing intormants,

ofttimes monetary remuneration is a prime factor, coupled

with

the need of a proper rapportbetween the agent and

the informant to fully develop the potential of the informant.

In regard to the expenditure of funds for security

informants and sources the San Francisco Division for the

period September 1968 to August 1969 expended $80 123.45

for informants and $311.00 for sources, while during

period September 1969 through August 1970 it expended

$76,789.62 for informants and 1505 for sources. While

you should insure that value is received for funds expended,

In addition,

it should be impressed upon all agents

of the San Francisco

Division that each has a responsibility

of pinpointing security informant potentials for further

development by agents handling security matters.

...

In connection with the overall administrative

handling of the informant files of your division, am in

addition to the weaknesses pointed out in the memoranda

referred to above, it was noted that the "pink sheet" in

several of these informant files were not completed.

The

identities of these files were called to your attention

and the completion of these "pink sheets" should be accommlished

at an early date.

OBSERVATIONS

From an overall analysis of the security matters

in the San Francisco Division, it appears a prime factor

for a successful operation in

this area is the close

coordination

of the three security squads along with the

racial squad in view of the scope of the problem dealing

with extremists in this area.

This is necessary to insure

that each desk is madeaaware of the pertinent information

relating to the operation of that desk.

CHH 55148 DocId:32989637 Page 241

Another impolant and prime factor is the fact that

your office must develop "member informants" in each extremist

group and organization in order that you will be in possession

of advanced information on all contemplated acts of violence

or other pertinentacts on the part of these

groups prior to

the act taking place.

INSTRUCTIONS

The Bureau must be immediately advised of any

outbreak of demonstrations or proposed demonstrations

within your division. In this regard you should insure

that all employees

are aware that such

activities which

occur during the night within your division are brought

to the Bureau's attention by the opening of business

at

the Seat of Government the following morning. This is

extremely important

as the White House, the Attorney General

and other interested Government agencies rely heavily on

the Bureau to keep them advised of subversive and New Left

activities throughout the United States.

Promptly review your overall operations relating

to your intormant program, correcting any weaknesses therein

to insure an effective program is in operation to develor

"memberinformants" for in-depth coverage in all revolutionary

groups, branches and other affiliations of these groups.

In this

regard it should be stressed to all agents that

, each have a definite responsibility in this area.

In connection with the violence-oriented extremist

groups, you are reminded that a group of like-minded individuals

as dangerous, or more dangerous, than well-organized

extremist groups. This is pointed out by the increase of

unprovoked

attacks against police and the increase of acts

of violence, not only throughout the United States but in

articular in your division as indicated by the above relate

statistics.

With this in mind, you should insure that intormant.

known to congregate; (5) insure informants are alert to

RACIAL MATTERS AND INFORMANTS

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHARD

10/23/70

PART I. INVESTIGATIVE ASPECTS

A.

Since the last inspection the territory covered

by the San Francisco Office has experienced no mass demonstra-

tions, riots or confrontations of a racial nature.

The period

has been characterized as an organizational drive

• for minorities

other than black.

These other minorities are of the belief

that the blacks through organizational activity, demonstrations

and violence have gotten and are receiving a disproportionate

share of Government funds and

attention. All of these groups

want what they believe is their fair share and that is one

hundred per cent of all that is available. This development has

had a sobering effect on black demands, by occupying their time

attempting to hold on to their recent gains.

Spanish surname groups are the most advanced in their

organizational activities, with Chinese groups ivijowing.

The violence problem involves the shooting of

policemen and numerous bombings.

In San Francisco alone in 1970, four police officers

have met violent ends.

22, was killed by two

black robbers.

On 2/18/70,

MC DONALD was killed in the bombing of the Park Police

Sot. station.

Those responsible have never been determined. On 6/19/70,

RICHARD RADETICH was shot through the head in the early morning

hours while writing a traffic ticket in the Haight-Ashbury

District. Those responsible are unknown. On 10/19/70, Officer

HAROLD I HAMIIION was killed by a bank robber.

Outside of San Francisco, most notable incidents of

the killing and wounding of police officers are as follows:

Black Panther Party (BPP) Capt: RANDY WILLIAMS On

the evening of 4/17/70, with two others in Oakland, shot

up a police paddy wagon being driven by two officers.

officers were wounded. Weapons used were both automatic

and conventional. Another police vehicle responding to the

officers' in the paddy wagon call for help came under gunfire

and was hit five times. Those responsible for the shooting

who were fleeing in a stolen vehicle in order to effect an

escape fired a shotgun and threw a hand grenade or bomb

the police vehicle.

A second grenade or bomb injured a bystander

and her five year old daughter.

awaiting trial.

In San Jose on August 6, 1970, during the early

morning hours, Officer Richard Huerta was seated in his police

vehicle with a traffic offender who had run a red traffic

signal. Emit Aubert Thompson a San Jose State College law

enforcement student, walked up to the police vehicle and

emptied six shots at the officer, resulting in his death.

The twenty year old bystander admitted the killing and

claims the act resulted because he hates cops and subscribes

to the BPP philosophy: His father is a veteran police officer

and his brother a jailer of the Oakland Police Department.

In Berkeley on August 20, 1970 after midnight,

officer Bonal Tsukamoto was citing a motorcyclist for

a traffic violation.

A young black bystander engaged

l the

officer in a briet conversation betore pulling a gun

and firing two shots at point blank range, fatally wounding

the officer.

" ..

On

August 1, 1910, a shoot-out occurred at the Marin

County Civic Center, Which is in the greater San Francisco

metropolitan area.

An unsuccessful attempt by three convicts

and an accomplice to escape from a court room resulted in the

death of a Superior Court jurist and three other persons,

in addition, wounding a Deputy District Attorney and a juror.

Angela Yvonne Davis,

a self-admitted Communist Party member,

"protessed revolutionary and a recently dismissed Philosophy

instructor at the University of California at Los Angeles,

was charged with kidnapping and

murder for her part in the

abortive escape attempt.

Davis was apprehended by the FBI in

New York City on October 13,

1970 and is awaiting extradition

to California.

An example of an act of extreme violence occurred on

October 8, 1970 at 1:27 a.m.

The same Marin County Civic

Center where the judge and three others were killed was

bombed by persons unknown.

Partially destroyed was a Superior

Courtroom which suffered extensive damage.

DocId: 32989637 Page 252

## Page 253

In the opinion of many, a definite contributing

factor in the killing of police officers and other acts of

violence by extremists is the BPP official publication,

"The Black Panther"

This weekly newspaper prominently

features and eulogizes

so-called revolutionary acts

by any blacks.

There is every reason to expect a continuation

of violence against police officers and bombings of public

and military buildings.

Since the last inspection, no institution of higher

education has experienced racial disruptions in the territory

covered by San Francisco.

Some gang-type trouble has been

experienced in the high schools and these disturbances

break down along racial lines but are unorganized.

example of such trouble occurred on October 20, 1970 at the

Woodrow Wilson High School in San Francisco.

The school

has 2095 students, the vast majority of which are black.

Gang warfare broke out between the blacks and Samoans.

only 25 Samoan students attend this school.

A comprehensive intervier progran remains in effect

under which all BPP members and ex-members are being interviered

at least once and many several times, depending upon their

intelligence and the likelihood of their eventual cooperation.

Honey is known to be an essential factor and they are advised

of its availability in exchange for their full cooperation.

(These individuals were

specifically

on authority of the Bureau for

interviews because of their positions

as leaders in the BPP. In reality any member

disappointed, or irritated with the 3PP or one

of the leaders is inmediately targetod lor

interview.

The San Francisco Office is always

alert to this possibility through established

sources. )

Nation of Islam

(This

organization has committed no violent

acts and its mensership has remained relatively

fixed for

over two years.

Present informant

coverage is considered more than adequate.)

In the past the BSU at San Francisco State College has

been the only other Black Extrenist organization worthy of note

on college campuses.

This organization has been practically

emasculated; however, by the firm stand taken by San Francisco

State College President S. I. HAYAKAWA. It is unlikely it will

become a viable organization again this school year, but if it

does,

asst asis a memper and in a position to provide the

needed coverage.

i ex-3St Leader

at San Francisco State has been interviewed with some success

in the past and further steps are being taken to gain his con-

fidence.

Bu's on other college campuses in past years have

not cormitted any acts of violence and established sources advise

none are expected to occur this year.

Anytime a militant organization or group

appears to be taking shape or a legitimate group appears to

become militant a case is immediately opened on that organi-

zation.

The first order of business then becomes the

development of an informant from among the group and/or the

infiltration of that group by an established source. All

Agents are alerted to

the need and requested to cooperate.

It becomes the direct responsibility of the case Agent to

follow and assure that adequate live informant coverage is

available on the organization. When coverage decreases from

loss of an informant for some reason, the need is again pin-

pointed and all Agents are requested to assist with

suggested replacements.

The assistance of all police agencies,

sis solicited in

attempting to fill in any gaps in informant coverage. Close

supervision is afforded informant development.

PART II. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS

A.

The racial informant control file in the San

Francisco Office is 170-22.

A separate control file has been

opened to coordinate the development of a top level BPP infor-

mant (170-1030). The counterintelligence file is 157-601.

B .

Individuals identified as members or affiliates of

racial extremist groups come primarily from live informants

and from the technical informant coverage.

Channelizing

memoranda are prepared by Agents handling live informants,

the memoranda routed over the desk and new cases opened

promptly where warranted.

Information originating from

technical coverage is reviewed daily by Agents who prepare

individual memoranda.

These memoranda

are routed across

the desk and new cases opened promptly.

status.

The key racial extremists are kept in a pending

Information from all sources are channelized to

the files and these files are followed closely on tickler

to insure continuous investigative effort.

c.

The primary responsibility for reporting to the

local police that information received from informants rests

with the case agent handling the informant.

The Agent when

dictating the information received from informants remarks

that the

information was given to the local police. The

supervisor when initialing the report for duplication checks

to ascertain that proper dissemination has been made.

D.

Agitator Index cards and Security Index cards are

current. Case Agents have primary responsibility and squad

supervisors reading reports and reviewing files on ticklers

check to determine whether individual names of Subjects

should be included on any index.

E.

The Black Nationalist Photographic Album is main-

tained in the supervisor's office. Necessary changes are

routed to the Squad #9 secretary who makes the changes or

inserts the form into the album, and initials the accompanying

letter. Case is assigned to an

agent for periodic review.

There are no active extremist organizations in San

Francisco Division in which the case agent has failed to

develop an informant. It is to be noted, however, that the

BPP case is assigned

squad and several informants have been developed as indicated

in Part I, Sections B and E.

G.

All Agents operating racial informants have been

advised to report all statistical accomplishments in the

criminal field on FD-209's or contact memos and to flash same

for the attention of the racial supervisor.

These memos or

The BPP will accept

help, both physical and financial, from anyone desirous of

However, they seldom help anyone else and, in

has had very little visible effect on the course of the

Party.

Informants have been alerted to report any such

influence and careful review of all material received from

technical coverage of the BPP is analyzed to insure any

information pertinent to this problem is reported.

Top level informants in the NOI report no outside

B. The effect of New Left and Communist influence

on the BPP has been negligible. The BPP from the beginning

has been almost solely interested in the problems of the

community blacks, and while repeating Communist and/or

Socialist type slogans, have seldom rendered any assistance

to groups from these leftist organizations.

The BPP attorney is Charles Garry, former CP, USA

member and leftist oriented thinker,

who is, in all

probability, responsible for the leftist slant to BPP

publications, slogans, and teachings.

The most prominent

instance of the cooperation between the BPP and the white

radical left came in the National Convention of the United

Front Against Fascism (UFAF) held in Oakland, California,

in July, 1969.

that a major new development was on hand, as CP, USA

and New Left leaders converged on the gathering and made

speeches.

However, a split ensued between all

groups, i.e.,

between the biacks

and

the wnites, and vetween certain

elements of the radical whites.

The CP, USA fell out with

the New Left, the Jews criticized the BPP for its anti-

Israel stance, and

the PLP attacked and was counter-attacked

by the others

in the New Left.

This grand design came

apart and eventually Eldridge Cleaver began writing of the

CP,

USA in the past tense,

and attacking Negro writers

, the "Daily World"

and the

"Guardian".

He engaged in

polemical discussion, in writing, with William Patterson,

Negro spokesman for

the CP, USA.

Thus, a year or more

later, it might be said that the BPP has little rapport

with the CP, USA and its exemplar, the CP, USSR. Ih€

Soviet Union has received many criticisms in the pages of

"The Black Panther" newspaper.

The New Left does maintain its relations with the

brothers (three Negroes accused of killing a

prison guard),

as examples.

Limited intelligence regarding stolen or stockpiling

weapons of violence in files, however, a check with the

California State Bureau of Criminal Identification and

Investigation disclosed approximately 27,375 guns stolen

per annum in the area covered by the san

Francisco Office.

The extent of racial extremists involved in these thefts

unknown, however, numerous thefts establish potential source

for racial militants to obtain weapons of violence.

Twenty-elght acts of counterintelligence, unfixed physical

sarveiflanees,

along with 110 other physical surveillances,

were conducted in connection with BPP activities. The

numerous acts of violence and extensive damage to persons

and property is indicative of the absolute need for quality

in-depth informant coverage on all militant extremist groups.

San Francisco is the most important office in connection

with the investigation of the BPP, whose National Headquarters

is located in two adjoining buildings in Oakland, California.

In addition,

two other active chapters of the BPP are located

in San Francisco and Richmond, California.

The San Francisco

Chapter has on its premises the National Distribution Office

of the BPP where the weekly newspaper, "The Black Panther," is

prepared. You have advised this paper has a circulation of

about. 135,000 copies per week and is distributed throughout

the U.S. and abroad.

As Office of Origin in the BPP investi-

gations, your office has the task of coordinating the

investigation of this extremely militant group for the whole

country, resulting in an extremely heavy paper load in the

administrative handling of this investigation.

It is imperative that investigations concerning

this terroristic and militant organization be directed with

the utmost imagination and aggressiveness to insure that

the Bureau's responsibilities are fulfilled. The most

plated acts of this violence-pione group.

as those individuals

who are openly advocating violence,

"anarchy or insurrection.

These investigations must be

Bureau is promptly advised of all circumstances

concerning

this more current and important area of our work.

Agents

handling racial matters should be familiar with SAC Letter

70-18(C), which sets out guidelines for handling of bombings

Make certain that personnel assigned to racial

fact that active investigation of gun law violations

should be conducted when these violations directly relate

to any investigation of which the Bureau has primary

investigative jurisdiction. This is particularly pertinent

to investigations concerning the BPP, as well as other

terroristic, extremist and hate groups.

Agents handling racial matters must be familiar

with SAC Letter 68-74 (D)

dated 12/24/68, which instructs

that certain black extremists may be interviewed with SAC

authority.

Further, you should continue to make certain that

where there are public rallies or demonstrations by extremists

that appropriate steps to record speeches made at these

gatherings by black extremists are being made.

In this

regard, you should obtain tape recoraings of other speeches

made by extremists which are heard within your territory.

Racial Informants

As office of origin for the BPP, you have a

critical responsibility for developing informants in this

group who are knowledgeable concerning the overall activities

of the BPP throughout the United States and especially

knowledgeable concerning the activities of the BPP within

your division. You have made some progress in developing

informants in the BPP: However, this progress is limited

and there is an urgent need for

quality informants in this organization. The immediate

need for informants in the racial field was shown earlier

in this write-up where it was indicated

that numerous

acts

of violence have occurred in your division since the last

inspection in which you were unable to furnish information

as to the

participants or whether or not the violence was

racial oriented.

A particular weakness on the part of San

Francisco has been to develop informants in the upper echelon

Leadenship of the BPP who can furnish information concerning

details of BPP finances and overall day-to-day activities

in the BPP offices.e

An example of San Francisco's weakness concerning

informant coverage is noted in your file 157-5822, which

concerns an allegation that two

indicate that you have racial informants,

The difference between the Bureau records and the above

The development of sources, particularly in the Resident

Agency territories where so many institutions of higher

education are located, is an urgent need of the San Fran-

cisco Division.

The favorable growth in the number of ghetto

informants is noteworthy and necessary if the substantial

need to increase the number of RIs and RI (probs) is met by

your office.

The need for additional quality informant coverage

cannot be over-emphasized, particularly since you have

several areas that have experienced acts of violence where

there are no racial informants and racial informant probationaries.

Although you have indicated ghetto informants have been

developed in some of these areas, you recognize that these

informants are primarily listening posts and have not been able

to furnish the quality intelligence information that is

needed for the Bureau to fulfill its responsibilities in

the racial field.

You should insure that this matter of

developing quality racial informants is immediately brought

to the attention of all Resident Agents and efforts chould be

made to reverse this undesirable situation.

During this inspection, you were advised separately

by "trend memoranda" concerning certain delinquencies in the

handling of racial informant files.

It is most important

that Agents

handling racial matter

informants be completely

familiars with Bureau instructions and that these instructions

are followed explicitly. Make certain that all Agents are

giving their informants

assignments and are alert for

evidentiary-type information,

as well as intelligence-type

information.

Due to the sensitivity of informant files,

you should continue to insure that these files are being

afforded complete security and that personnel having access

are mature individuals who can be expected to maintain

them under the most secure conditions.

With respect to your ghetto informants, insure

they are being given assignments, including attendance

at public meetings held by extremists, survey of

extremist book stores, verification of residence and

employment of AI and SI subjects living or working in

ghetto areas, identity of extremists agitating in local

areas and information concerning youth gangs operating

in neighborhoods in such a fashion as to increase racial tension.

You should remain alert to the fact that ghetto

informants, in view of their unique positions in

usually

high-crime

areas and since black extremists are involved

in criminal activities,

should also be obtaining criminal

statistics in addition

• to racial-type information. In

this connection, San Francisco, only five months out of

the last 17 months, has furnished criminal statistics

achieved through RIs, which includes ghetto informants.

The field average in submitting criminal statistics from

racial informants is 8 out of 17.

Your office should devise

a workable program wherein all criminal statistics achieved

through cacial informants are properly recorded and racial

informants are given proper assignments.

In addition, make certain that personnel handling

racial informants are uiilizing

the Black Extremict Fugitive

List in connection with the National Photograph Album.

Special Agents should be familiar with the instructions

set out in Bureau letter to all field offices dated 8/29/70,

captioned "Black Extremist Activities in Penal Institutions,

Racial Matters".

and is, therefore, in a position to furnish detailed

information concerning the

for our intelligence-gathering operations.

In addition,

this is essential for evidence to be used in connection

with the possible forthcoming Smith Act prosecutions.

Make

certain you continue to give your informants proper direction

so that full value can be obtained from their potential.

SE 3121-prob and SE 3056-R appear to have

potential for obtaining valuable racial information, as

well as evidentiary information. It is imperative that

these informants be utilized in

such a way that their

potential value is consummated.

Stockpiling of Weapons and Ammunition

Your control file 157-3021 captioned "BPP

WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES", and 157-1171, "Stockpiling of

Arms and Ammunition", were reviewed and indicate that

these matters receive almost daily attention from SE 3215-R

It is imperative that all agents are constantly made aware

of the tremendous importance of these matters and the need

for quality informants to provide information in this

field. During the current inspection, a timely example

of the need for informants in this particular area was

noted when the Oakland Police Department recovered a cache

of weapons and explosives which included 20 sticks of dynamite,

and other guns and explosives.

They were recovered

0n 10/27/70, at the 55th Avenue Motel in Oakland.

Further, another timely example during the

current inspection occurred when five individuals were

arrested on a military reservation in your territory while

doing target practice, including one using a rifle that was

determined to be stolen from the military. These individuals

were identified as former BPP members and associates.

Again,

the demand and absolute necessity for quality in-depth

informants to apprise you of the individuals maintaining

weapons of violence is apparent.

The BPP is noted for its terroristic nature

and philosophy of violence.

Never in our history have

we been confronted with as

critical a need

for informant

coverage in such a violence-oriented organization. Bombings,

kidnappings, murder of police officers are all included in

the violence performed by these militant fanatics.

ever spiraling crime rate, particularly in the ghetto,

has provided additional fuel for the militant and malcontent.

The racial situation is extremely serious and presents a

perplexing domestic problem which cannot be over stressed.

The vital role of the Bureau's personnel in the racial

field

is pressing and apparent.

The Bureau is constantly being

judged by our ability to

develop timely Intelligence, to

identify the leaders, the direction of movement of all

radical groups and, where possible, to predict potential

trouble spots.

To fulfill these grave responsibilitles,

we must have an efficient wide-spread network of intelligent,

resourcerul, aggressive, and quality informants and sounces.

The informant inadequacies which have been brought to your

attention should be rectified as quickly as possible and

extremists are absolutely necessary.

In this regard you

are instructed to intensify your interview program and

exert aggressive action to satisfy the urgent need for

informants in the upper echelon of, BPP leadership.

3. You should immediately designate informants

on the peripheral of the BPP for priority attention inasmuch

as BPP

membership may open up at any time and should have

some informants ready to move in.

In this regard, current

• BPP member informants should be designated for direction

to move into leadership positions should such positions

develop.

4. You should aggressively pursue the potential

for BPP informants through the infiltration of Panther

pads.

An individual properly directed could possibly be

accepted in the pad which could not only provide coverage

but lead to a BPP leadership position.

5.

Investigation of all pads and community

centers in your division should be followed closely to make

certain that the black extremists are identified and

investigated in accordance with Bureau instructions.

6.

Make certain that all informants are alerted

to the theft of weapons of violence in order that your office

and the Bureau can be promptly advised of extremists involved

in potential acts of violence.

is apparent and you should immediately instruct that where

black extremist groups, including the Black Student Union,

is located in your territory without coverage that efforts

be made to correct this deficiency at once.

In this regard,

the recent change in Bureau policy permitting interviews of

individuals under 21 years of age should be made known to

all personnel handling these matters in an attempt to increase

your informant coverage.

You should continue your counterintelligence

program and be alert to any new schemes you might submit to

the Bureau for approval to use in this regard.

9. You should consider the placing of all black

extremist fugitives now handled on the criminal squads on

the desk of the Racial Matters Supervisor.

Further in this

regard, you must make certain that all black extremists

who are subjects of substantive cases on criminal desks

are coordinated with the Racial Matters Desk.

4.

In order to maintain stability of your program and to insure CIs

and PCIs are not "turned over" for turnovers sake, do you require Agents

to submit a newly developed CI or PCI at time closing or discontinuing

memoranda are submitted on old ones?

5. What administrative procedures do you have to insure your sub-

stantive supervisors are aware of and participate in informant program?

Do they approve both opening and closing memoranda? Are they aware of

• productivity of CIs and PCIs handled by Agents assigned to their squads?

How? Do you maintain a record of productivity by desk?

6. How often is Criminal Informant Program discussed by supervisors

at squad conferences?

7.

Do you keep statistics by Resident Agency (or road trip territory)

on productivity of informants? Do you feel your informant coverage in each

Resident Agency (road trip) is adequate? Where are the weaknesses? Handle

each individually.

8.

Do you feel your informant coverage in headquarters city is

adequate? Break down by squad giving consideration to types of classifi-

cations handled by each.

9. What administrative devices do you employ to follow Agents working

criminal cases in headquarters city and in Resident Agencies to be certain

each is making maximum contributions to the Criminal Informant Program?

10.

What steps are taken to eliminate the carrying of PCIs in a pending

status'for over one year, when during that time they have been unable to

produce sufficient information to qualify as criminal informants?

11.

Racial and ghetto informants have proven to be of valuable assistance

in solution of numerous criminal cases. What provisions have you made to

make these sources available to Agents working criminal work? How and to

whom do they submit their requests for contact with these informants?

Agents contacting informants outside of normal working

hours obtained supervisory approval for these contacts

prior to making them and make appropriate notations on

their #3 cards.

Supervisors thereafter, during file

reviews with Agents, check with them regarding those

contacts and spot-check informant files to insure after-

hour contacts were made and appropriately recordea.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT .

1o The overall objectives of the criminal informant program

are to develop high quality informants who are in a

position to furnish valuable information on a continuing

basis.

Criminal desk supervisors participate in the program by

remaining alert to the necessity of having good informant

coverage in the criminal classifications which are covered

by their respective desks. The supervisor is also

required to approve any expenditure made to an informant

for information or services concerning any case

handled on his desk and in this way will be aware of the

progress of the program as it relates tactivities in

The supervisors also follow the Agents'

this regard on an individual basis to insure that they

are fully participating in the informant program.

The San Francisco Office does have standards which

requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this

division should conform to and that is they should have

a minimum of four PCIs or one CI and two PCIs or two

CIs assigned at any one time. This, of course, is by

no means considered a maximum and many Agents

participate more fully in the program.

There are currently no first office agents assigned to

this division and when an Agent is transferred to this

division and assigned to criminal work he is expected

to show some progress by the end of sixty days and

within one year he is expected to be in compliance

with the above standarûs.

Regarding the Government reservations, it is noted

that specific liaison assignments have been made in regard

to these but inasmuch as persons normally contacted on these

bases are Government employees contacted on an official

basis, they are not considered appropriate for development

as CIs and are bound to furnish information as part of

their auties.

It is noted, however, that the Hunters Point

Naval Shipyard is in a predominantly negro area and two

PRIS, 170-845 and 170-241, are under development at that

in the legalized cararooms and night clubs in this area.

Coverage in the counties of Mendocino and Lake is

limited to the close personal relationship with deputy

sheriffs that cover the remote areas of these counties, which

principal industries are logging and ranching.

There are no principal targets for informant

development, such as shipping companies, railroads, airports,

or large industries.

Coverage has been established in

gambling, 137-3976 and 137-4486. In night clubs, coverage

has been established with females, 137-5819 and 137-5818,

both of whom are furnishing quality information and will

be

converted

as CIs.

desks.

In this way they are aware of the productivity .

of the informant program as it concerns them. Also,

if there is any particular problem concerning the

handling of a particular informant, a supervisor is

expected to assist and give guidance to the agent

handling this

particular informant.

Supervisors are

also regularly remindea of the importance of the

Informant program at supervisors'

conferences and follow

their individual agents to insure that they are fully

participating.

Supervisors in this office are not required to approve

either closing or opening memoranda on informant files.

No record 1s kept of productivity orintormants Dy

lesks, however, this information is readily available

through the monthly statistical letter submitted on

informant production inasmuch as each statistic is

reported by classification.

Agents are remindeù of the criminal informant program

and their responsibility to participate in it at each

biweekly squad conference.

7.

Informant statistics are not kept by RA or road trip

territory, however, this information would be available

if it were necessary to obtain it by review of the

particular informant files that are providing coverage

in these areas.

Our informant coverage in each RA

area is considered adequate at this time and no particular

weaknesses are noted.

However, efforts are made on a

continuing basis to try to improve coverage in all

areas.

8. It is felt that informant coverage at Headquarters City

is adequate at this time, but as indicated innunber

seven above, a continuing effort is made to improve this

coverage.

Regarding the coverage provided by each criminal desk,

it is noted that as of October 12, 1970, the following

CIs and PCIs are being handled off the

Administrative devices used to make certain agents are

making maximum contributions to the criminal informant

program are that the agents are followed on an individual

basis through file reviews and supervisor conferences to

insure they are meeting the criteria as set forth in

The criminal informant files

are also specifically reviewed on a semi-annually basis

at the time the semi-annual IHMs are submitted to the

Bureau.

It is also noted files are checked at the time

they are posted on a continuing basis.

10. Informant files are reviewed at the end of the first

year they have been opened on an individual basis and

if they have been unproductive the agent is advised to

close the case and replace the PCI with anew one.

If the PCI has been productive the agent, handling him

is advised to convert him to a criminal informant. If

it is a questionable matter it is discussed with the

agent handling the PCI on

an individual basis and a

decision is reached in this matter inasmuch as the

agent is in a better position to make the judgement as

to the potential of this particular PCI.

11. All agents in the San Francisco Division are aware of

the racial and ghetto informant program through

participation. If an agent has a case that he feels

warrants contacting of ghetto informants he will

dictate a memorandum setting forth specifically that

they should be contacted by the particular agents

handling them.

No actual record is kept of how much use is made of

the geographical criminal informant index.

However, it

Iras proveù to be à valuable tool in determining uho

the logical informants are to contact in any given

This has saved many investigative hours by

making easily available to each agent the particular

ADDENDUM

c.

LARSON

A11 criminal informant (CI) files and a representative

number of potential criminal informant (PCI) files were reviewed

during this inspection.

Following review, a memorandum

disclosing the rating

afforded in each file has been forwarded

to you for inclusion in the respective file.

Your office is currently operating 145 CIs as

compared to 141 CIs being operated at the time of the last

inspection. There is also an increase in the number of PCIS

under development at this time to 271 as opposed to 250 under

development during the last inspection.

These figures do not

include Top Echelon informants or targets for development

which are commented on separately under the Criminal Intelligence

Program. This represents a slight increase in the number of

CIs and a more substantial increase in the number of PCIs

under development.

However, there is a slight decrease in

two large metropolitan areas, namely, San Francisco and Oakland,

which though slight represents a static situation as to

increasing coverage in these areas.

The Oakland Resident

Agency has

also recorded a decrease in the number of PCIs

under

development.

In analyzing the coverage in the resident

agencies, it was noted that Monterey, Richmond and San Jose

have the same coverage from CIs as during the last inspection

although Monterey and San Jose have shown a substantial

increase in the number of PCIs being handled.

PCIs under

development in Salinas and San Rafael are down somewhat,

although this too in part is off-set by the increase in

number of CIs being operated.

In view of the Bureau's

the

increased responsibilities, it is absolutely essential that

a strong criminal informant program be maintained and in

fact expanded if the Bureau is to meet these increased

responsibilities.

QUALITY

All of the CI files were reviewed during this

inspection and the following ratings were given to the CIs

presently being operated by this office:

Because SF 3308-C furnishes

information principally as a result of his employment in

the U.S. Army, Personnel Center, Oakland, California Army

Base, this informant should be discontinued as a CI and

converted to a Confidential source.

SF 2290-C was recently

reopened on the basis of having provided a service to

Department of Justice attorneys and the Bureau but has furnished

no criminal information for an extended period

of time and

had been in a closed status since 3/10/69. This informant

should also be discontinued as a CI and considered as a

Confidential Source.

You should appropriately advise the

Bureau that this action has been taken.

The following informants have been rated Fair and

they should be given specific assignments for a period of

90 days in an attempt to improve their productivity. At

the end of that period of time you should advise the Bureau

of reasons for continuing them as informants or that they

• are being discontinued.

AGENT PARTICIPATION

You have indicated Special Agents JAMES P. MALOY,

CARLTON H. WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY have spent 50% or

more of their time on criminal type investigative matters

during thepast year but do not currently have assigned a

qualified CI personally developed by them. Further comment

is being set forth later in this addendum concerning these

Agents.

PAYMENTS

A review of payments indicates that your office

paid an average of $1,473.98 a month to informants during

the period immediately preceding the last inspection. For

the

period immediately preceding this inspection, an average

of $1,643.10 was paid to informants each month.

A spot

check of payments made to CIs and PCIs indicated value was

being received for the money paid. You should insure that

your personnel are alert to the use of monetary payments to

entist the further cooperation of informants by compensating

them for expenses incurred in pursuit of information for

this Bureau and as compensation for their effort on the

Bureau's behalf.

You should continue to closely evaluate

informant payments to insure that value is received for money

paid.

• ACCOMPLISHMENTS

According to Bureau records your office shows

increases in 4 of the 8 statistical accomplishments

attributable to informants and it is noted that these

increases have occurred in matters concerned directly with FBI

investigations.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

You have indicated a rather extensive involvement

of supervisory personnel in directing informant development to

those areas of responsibility coming within the scope of

their respective desks.

Referring to Government reservations

and military installations, you indicated you do not

consider Government employees

appropriate for development as

CIs as they are bound to furnish information as part of

their duties. Your attention is specifically directed to

Section 108, I-12, Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, which

states informants

should be developed on Government

reservations and military installations when warranted.

In

view of the large installations located within your territory,

it is suggested you identify particular areas of these

installations wherein informant coverage would be logical

and productive and give consideration to pinpointing such areas

for development.

You have also indicated that Supervisors approve

payments to informants and in this way are also aware of the

productivity of the informant program.

However, It is noted

that approval of payments provides a rather limited

assessment of the productivity of informants and points out

the need for a continuing evaluation of respective coverage.

Supervisors must constantly be alert to identify specific

areas in which informant coverage would be logical and

hinductive.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

You should give consideration to the development

of informants on Government reservations and military

installations as suggested by the Manual of Instructions.

In a number of

instances, it was noted there was

no follow-up on incomplete information furnished by informants.

In such instances, the informant was not recontacted any

sooner than required by the 30 day contact rule, which would

indicate a lack of direction of the informant to further

develop information of interest. The need to give informants

direction to develop information to the point it can be

considered useful and valuable should be brought to the

attention of all appropriate investigative personnel.

There were few instances noted during review of

the CI files wherein FD-302's had been utilized in recording

informant information.

It is recognized that much information

regarding fugitives and possible suspects does not require

Bill 30 which will greatly expand the opportunity to utilize

informant information, you should make certain all personnel

are aware of those instances in which informant information

should be recorded on an FD-302 and the proper method for so

recording it.

Numerous areas have been identified in your

territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie

a high incidence of crime.

over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and

the heavily populated East Bay area and to facilitate a more

convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to

this information, you should consider preparing a large wall

map of the San Francisco - East Bay area and placing it in a

central secure position in the office.

In addition to criminal

informants, you should include

the location in which racial

and ghetto informants will logically be able to furnish

information and you should identify the location of all these

informants on the map with an appropriate locator reference

to an index showing the agent to whom the informant is

In the period of time I have been

to the qualification of them as

approved Criminal Informants.

In the past year since I

last had an approved Criminal Informant I have handled

several PCIs including one who previously was the prime

factor in the apprehension of a Bureau fugitive wanted

for the murder of a police officer.

This PCI has since

furnished information of value which was relayed to the

local police in a burglary case. He has been given the

assignment to develop further information concerning local

suspects in the handling of stolen merchandise from this

and other burglaries.

In the past year I have been unable

to devote a great deal of time to the development of this

and other PCIs due to having been utilized as Relief

Supervisor in the absence of the regular supervisor and

because of the time necessary. to prepare and preseni lectures

at police schools on legal matters.

I am aware of the importance of the

develop a qualified Criminal Informant and expect to

I am extremely aware of the need to

develop CIs and have had a total of

nine PCIs in San Francisco during the

time I have been in san Francisco.

I arrived in the san Francisco Division,

7/13/69, on transfer from the Chicago Division. It Is to be noted

that I

developed CG 72150 in 1967.

This informant had either

worked for or was close to the top men of organized crime in Chicago,

Miami and New Orleans.

At one time, through a court order, this

Informant was wired with a microphone and tape recorder so

Information could be obtained in an Obstruction of Justice case.

I had at least one other informant while I was handling the

above informant, and handled both until leaving Chicago.

The potential of the four PCIs which I

opened on 8/24/70 and the one which I opened 10/19/70 appears

promising and it is anticipated that at least one will develop

Into a CI in the near future.

My assignments in san t'rancisco lavo

been

mainly IISP - FBW investigations which are complicated and

Involve reviewing records and interviews with banks, brokerage

I had ono excellent

opportunity to develop a good CI when LOUIS MARDER, Las Vegas

led to

the recovery of $650,000 worth of Avco Thrift Certificates

at Las Vegas. MARDER as recently as 10/27/70, furnished mo

valuable information. He cannot be developed into a CI because

supervisory personnel to surpass the prior year's accomplish-

ments in all four categories of convictions; fines, savings,

and recoveries; fugitives apprehended; and automobiles

recovered.

The Bureau by letter dated 7/13/70 called this

to your attention and pointed out that each SAC must

exhibit aggressive sound leadership in the future.

pointed out that failure to meet this challenge reflects

most unfavorably upon the SAC's ability as an administrator

and an FBI official. The SAC was instructed to take

immediate steps to analyze the investigative and supervisory

programs and take corrective action where necessary.

As will be noted for the first three months of

the current fiscal year (FY), your convictions are deficient

by 37% as are your fines, savings, and recoveries. Ihis

is a continuation of a most undesirable trend.

In analyzing the lack of convictions, it was

noted that you had a decline in the Theft From Interstate

Shipment classification of 39% in fiscal year 1970, anc

a continuation of this downward trend during the first

three months of the current FY. In the Selective Service

category during the first three months of Fy 1971 you

obtained only 9 convictions as compared with 21 in the

prior year for a decline of 57%. This number of convictions

seems very low when considering the fact that as of 9/30/70

you had pending in this office 2257 cases in this category.

During first three months of current FY there has

been a decline of 87% in the ITSMY category (1 vs 8) and

a decline of 86% in the Theft of Government Property classi-

fication (1 vs 7). In addition, no convictions were obtained

as of 9/30/70 in the Interstate Transportation of Stolen

Property category and you had pending in the office 307

cases.

Your accomplishments seem very low for your investment

• in manpower.

It was noted that as of 10/1/70 there were no

vacancies with respect to Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys,

or Assistant U. S. Attorneys, which might reflect unfavorably

upon your statistical picture. You advised the Bureau

that you had 352 subjects under indictment and several

hundred Selective Service cases pending prosecution which

indicates you may have the potential for correcting this

situation before the end of the year.

Comments of following supervisors are requested

through sources available to this office to expedite these

matters in U.S. District Court. It will be noted that as of

10/14/70 the San Francisco Office had 414 outstanding

indictments. 57 of these are fugitives that are out of the

country and since that date, on October 14, 15 and 21, 1970,

an additional 39 indictments have been obtained giving a tótal

of #53 outstanding indictments.

The total Selective Service

matters presently awaiting

Federal Grand Jury action is 749.

The decline in statistios in the Selective Service category is

due to the lack of action on the part of the U.S. District

Court Judges due to the

lack of enthusiasm and the coddling

of these cases by the U.S: District Court Judges. It will

be noted that several of these cases have been under submission

decline of 86% in the TGP classification (1 vs. 7).

One of the main reasons for reduction in convictions

in the 26 classification this year over last year is the

Departmental guidelines pertaining to ITSMV matters.

combination of the 52-70 convictions this year is 18, as

compared with 13 last year.

I realize that the 26 and 52

convictions independently are below last year, but every

effort is being made to achieve and thereafter exceed the

goal set during the preceding year.

I constantly stress to those Agents in Headquarters

and the Resident Agencies which cover sources of 52 matters,

government reservations, transport facilities (shipment of

government

property), to be constantly alert to obtain those

matters which should be investigated by the FBI.

In addition, I would like to point out that I will

continue to take all necessary steps to exceed this year in

the statistical accomplishments of this squad

over the

previous

year.

I would like to point out that I have taken the

necessary steps and

will continue to do so in compliance with

Bureau instructions

to streamline the ITSMV matters and handle

only those that are fully justified and at the same time

pursue those that are justified towards convictions.

ITSP Matters

There was a gain in ITSP matters of one conviction

in fiscal year 1970 (seven) over fiscal year 1969 (six).

On 9/24/70, the San Francisco Office obtained one

conviction in the ITSP field (BUfile 87-111262, SFfile 87-31516).

We have every reason to believe therewill be a

Large per

centage increase in

statistical accomplishments in the ITSP

field for fiscal year 1971. We have a large amount of quality

cases

offering an excellent potential for statistical

accomplish-

ments.

At the present time we have four individuals indicted

in the 87 category.

Additionally, we have eleven other

subjects wherein we believe indictments will be obtained.

Two

of thesematters have already been aiscussed with the USA,

who has indicated he will seek indictments.

Additionally,

we have two 87- cases awaiting pleas under Rule 20 in other

field offices.

In view of the above,

we anticipate that we will

have at least seventeen convictions in the 87- field by the

end of the fiscal year 1971, plus any other cases that might

be reported to us.

There is every reason to believe in 1971

that we will not only equal but considerably exceed the

statistical accomplishments that we obtained in 1970.

As

noted above, we expect to at least double the amount of

convictions

obtained last year.

Mention should be made here to accurately present

the accomplishments of the squad in this category that as a

result of information obtained and developed by one of the

agents, the Las Vegas Office was able to recover $650,000

,of Avco thrift certificates (BUfile 87-108171, SFfile

: 87-30355).

TFIS Matters

The decline in convictions in this category has been

a matter of great concern, and every effort is being made to

reverse this situation.

The Bureau has been kept advised in

detail of this situation.

in convictions during

fiscal year 1970 was a direct result of

a change of policy

in the USA's office concerning the prosecution of these cases.

The high volume of convictions obtained by the San francisco

¡Office in past years was attributable to the policy of taking

WH 55148

DocId: 32989637 Page 336

181

## Page 337

Lun suda

petty offenders before the USC on the day that they were ap-

prehended and on that same day they would usually be sentenced

a guilty plea. The USA's office noted in a letter dated

7/11/69 that a review by their office of cases presented to

them in past years disclosed that almost none of the offenses

involved TFIS thefts where the value of the goods exceeded

$100 and that over 95 per cent of the cases referred to the

USA by the FBI had been handled by the USC under the Assimilative

Crimes Act.

The USA's office has recently had conferences

with the San Francisco PD and the San Francisco District

Attorney and has informed them of their policy not to prosecute

minor thefts of cases involving less than $100 and has urged

the San Francisco PD and District Attorney to accept and

handle these cases.

At the time of the current inspection, the San

Francisco Office has obtained eleven convictions compared to

twelve convictions obtained last year at this time.

Although

we are down one conviction compared to last. year at this.

time, there is every reason

to believe that we will exceed

last

year's accomplishments, as we have some good cases

pending prosecution.

• As noted above, the type of case we are handling

now as compared to those

in the past, is one that is more

likely to produce a high recovery value, and it should be

noted that

the amount recovered to date

during the current

fiscal year is $159,000, as compared to $6,000 last year.

I have personally discussed the prosecution of

TFIS cases with USA JAMES BROWNING, as well as several of

his assistants, pointing out the need for prompt indictment

and prosecution.

The Bureau is aware, of

course, of the

change in personnel of the USA's office, including the USA.

Another reason for the fact that we have not exceeded last

year's number of convictions is the cases

currently pending

prosecution have been assigned and re-assigned several times

to different AUSAs, as there has been a large turnover in

their staff.

There are currently three new attorneys which

handle the

majority of these prosecutions, none who have

been in office more than several months.

and as the files will

reflect in those cases offering a potential for prosecution,

they have stated they have not as yet had an opportunity to

review the case, since

it had

just been recently assigned to

them.

USA BROWNING has

advised that he is making every

effort to obtain faster indictments and subsequent prosecution

55118 DocId: 32989637

Page 337

## Page 338

of these cases, and he hopes with additional experience on

his part and on the part of his staff that cases will be

handled in a more expeditious

manner.

•Additionally, I have personally called upon local

businessmen in the transporation industry whoare a source

of these cases, as weld as having had frequent discussions

: with local police and District Attorney LOWELL JENSEN Of

Alameda County and Chief Criminal Deputy H.F. CLIFFORD

of San Francisco County, in order to apprise them of the

Bureau's policy and obtain more cooperation in these matters.

As noted above, we are only one conviction behind

our record of last year at this time and most definitely

feel that we will exceed our number of convictions obtained

in fiscal 1970.

I base this optimistic forecast on the fact

that the tremendous expenditure of Squad# agent time last

year in connection with civil rights cases will not be

duplicated in fiscal 1971 and that this tremendous amount of

investigative time can be directed toward securing additional

statistical accomplishments in those classifications handled

by squad #5.

General Observations

In order to accurately present an over-all picture

of the accomplishments of squad #5, it should be noted that in

fiscal year 1970 nine convictions were obtained in the 43-

• classification against four for the previous. fiscal years

and we have obtained one so far this fiscal

year.

Additionally, much of the efforts of this squad have

been directed towards

the handling of

the civil rights

cases

which grew out of the People's Park riots in Berkeley in 1969.

Currently indicted

are twelve Alameda County

sheriff deputies

and former deputies. It is estimated approximately 800 to 1000

interviews have been

conducted by the squad in connection

with the civil rights cases, all of which have had very short

period deadlines.

The USA has just commended this office by

letter dated 10/21/70 for the extremely able investigative

efforts and other assistance given to the USA's office.

trials are currently scheduled.

One took place in October;

another is

scheduled for 11/2

and the tremendous amount of

time

and attention give to these civil rights cases has taken

that investigative time away from other classifications

that might be more productive statistically.

Concerning the fact that the office is currently

deficient under the category fines, savings and recoveries,

HH 55148 DocId: 32989637 Page 338

189.

---

## Page 339

it should be pointed out herethat a report has been submitted

to the Bureau wherein a recovery value of sixty milLion

dollars

was claimed, which added to the fines, savings and

recoveries, will out

the office well ahead of last year in

this category. (BUfile 44-23710, SFfile 44-842).

BANK ROBBERY SURVEY

Inspector ARNOLD C. LARSON: Information concerning the bank

HO JARSON:

in Section 1M It

robbery survey supplied by the

San Francisco Office is reported

of the work papers of this inspection.

The following obsenvations and comments regarding bank

robbery matters are based upon a review of all pending origin

cases, a selection of closed and auxiliary office cases,

related control files, discussions

with appropriate personnel

assigned to these cases, and a review of the techniques and

procedures used by this office.

SOLUTIONS

According to Bureau records the San Francisco

Office from July 1, 1968, through September 30, 19/0, had

a total of 356 violations of the Federal Bank Robbery Statute

consisting of 311 robberies, 23 burglaries, and 22 larcenies.

0f

and 14 larcenies for a total of 254 are solved.

these violations 227 robberies, 13 burinaries,

• same period, 31 additional violations of the statute which

occurred prion to 1/1/68 were also solved.

As of 9/30/70, there are 77 robberies, 3 burglaries,

and 5 larcenies pending unsolved in the San Francisco

Office. Of these, 8 robberies and one larceny occurrec

prior

to 7/1/68.

A comparative tabulation of violations

and solutions which occurred during the period of the last

inspection and current inspection are set out below:

" Last Inspection Period;

As reflected in the tabulation above, your

overall solution nate of bank robbery matters since last

inspection has increased 19% which is a very favorable

trend.

This solution rate is indicative of the conscientious

continue this effort to effect solutions in these cases.

The 86 unsolved cases in the San Francisco

Office will require continuous aggressive, imaginative

effort inasmuch as experience has shown that as time passes

the solution rate in bank robbery and bank larceny cases

drops drastically.

It is noted all convictions obtained by the

San Francisco Office for bank robbery violations have been

handied in the U.S. District Court and it is noteworthy

that you have periected liaison to the point where these

matters are being handled exclusively by the Federal government.

The differences

between your figures and Bureau

figures is accounted for since Bureau figures are as of

-are as of October

September 30, 197 16, 1970.

and the San Francisco Office figures

Those areas requiring further attention in bank

robbery matters are those consisting of the greatest areas

of population; that is, Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, and

Headquarters.

In the case of Berkeley, it is suggested

I that

greater efforts be made to obtain informants connected with

the New Left element inasmuch as this area has the greatest

of the SoS anation in the San Francisco Bay Area and members

other revolutionary groups have indicated a

propensity for violence including bank robbery.

Although the percentage of delinquencies in

any classification is only one measure of the attention

being given cases in that category, the above tabulation

the comparative delinquency in the bank robbery

matters with the overall office delinquency and the

delinquencies in criminal matters.

It is noted that delinquencies in 91 matters

has been below the office generally in 10 out of the past

15 months.

The 6.2 delinquency and 5.3 delinquency shown

in the chart above appears to be excessive for those months

and all ertorts should be made to insure that this type

of delinquency does not recur in 91 matters. In this

all important category delinquency should be held at an

absolute minimum.

At the beginning of the current inspection there

were 11 approved Cis opened and assigned to the Agents on

the Bank Robbery Squad in the San Francisco Office. These

aware of the possibility of developing quality informants

from the Bank Robbery Suspect Program.

Agents handling

bank robbery matters should continue to be leaders within

• the office in this particular category.

The San Francisco Office has a total of 268

•ghetto informants, 14 racial informants, and & probationary

nacial informants. This is an excellent pool for obtaining

quality bank robbery iniormation and It should be fully

utilized by your office.

You should insure that dissemination

is promptly made for timely contacts of these sources when

the facts of a bank robbery are clear so that full advantage

can be made of any information they may have while the facts

are still fresh in the mind of those individuals that are

contacted.

BANK ROBBERY SUSPECTS

The Bureau has advised all offices of the need

to develop quality informants among known and suspected

armed robbers and burglars and thieves.

The Bank Robbery

Suspect Program has been most effective in developing informants

from among this element.

Your efforts should be directed

towards developing background information on individuals

previously convicted for bank robberies and bank burglaries

as well as armed robberies.

You should increase your efforts through

continuous intensive coverage of known robbers to

develop suspects or informants especially in view of the

cosmopolitan area of San Francisco and the closeness to the

Los Angeles and Las

• Vegas criminal elements.

accumulate all possible data concerning their backgrouno

and obtain photographs of these individuals as soon as possible

in order that they could be added to your Bank robbery

Album and utilized

during your investigation of bank robberies

in your territory.

ADMINISTRATIVE HANDLING

Review of your files discloses that in general

bank robbery cases and related matters are receiving the

attention they deserve

and are generally well administered.

Procedures being followed by the San Francisco Office

contorm to the bureau rules and regulations in regard

to the prompt notification of the Bureau of a bank robbery

violation and prompt submission of initial reports within

30 days.

however, it is noted in several instances in

which notes have been

used these notes after being obtained

have not been promptly submitted to the FBI Laboratory.

The need Ior obtaining and promptly submitting these notes

should be brought to the attention of all the Agents on the

Bank Robbery squad. The obtaining of these notes and the

prompt submission is necessary in both those cases in which

the subject is unknown as well as those in which the Subject -

has been identified.

In view of the number of bank robberies that

have occurred throughout the San Francisco territory

newspapers apparently have shown a reluctance to publicize

photographs of subjects obtained from surveillance cameras

during the commission of the

robberies. Efforts should be

made to institute a program in which newspapers can be induced

to publish these photographs throughout the territory

covered by the San Francisco Office shortly after the commission

of a robbery in which a good likeness of the Subject has

been obtained.

EVIDENCE

be submitted to the Bureau on the day of the violation or

• as soon

thereafter as possible.

If local authorities have

the original note, copies should be promptly and forwarded

in accordance with existing proceaures.

In the absence of

unusual circumstances the initial 30 day report in bank

robbery cases should contain results of the Laboratory

and Identification Division

examinations.

In 91-9460 a bank robbery was committed on

10/9/70, and although the Subject was apprehended he had

left a note and this note has

not yet been submitted to the

FBI Laboratory.

In 91-9446 a bank robbery occurred on 10/5/70,

and indications are that the suspect involved in this case

may possibly have been involved in three other, bank robberies.

This robbery was another in which a note was used and there

is no indication in this file that this note has

been submitted to the Bureau.

Other cases in which there

were not timely submissions of latent prints and/or demand

notes were noted in your files 91-9439, 91-9382, 91-9410,

91-9395. It is essential that personnel of your office

fully comply with existing Bureau procedures relative to the

prompt submission of evidence in bank robbery matters. In

the above instances you are instructed to immediately submit

demand notes or copies thereof to the Bureau for appropriate

examination.

NCIC

In 91-9410 and 91-9446 the Unknown Subjects

obtained bait money, however, there is no indication that

the serial numbers of the bait money have been entered

into NÇIC.

You should insure that bait money in bank

robberies is entered into NCIC immediately.

SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

In approximately 75 to 80% of the bank robberies

in which a photograph was obtained it was of material

assistance

in solving the case.

In addition, where Subject

chas

been identified by other means, the photograph was

available as corroborative evidence.

On the other hand, if a bank camera does not

photograph the Subject or produces

a blurred result because

of poor lighting it is an expense to the bank and of no

practical use toward the solution of the case.

In 91-9460 a surveillance camera had been

installed by the bank, however, it was not activated during

the commission of the robbery.

that during clinics conducted by your office, banks are

instructed to insure cameras are in proper working condition,

properly serviced and bank employees are aware of the value

of activating the cameras at the proper time.

BANK ROBBERY CLINICS

It is noted that the San Francisco Office is

conducting frequent Bank Robbery Clinics throughout the

division to give banking institutions instructions

concerning their role in bank robbery investigations

and to create a continued interest among bank officials

to adopt a continuing training program for their employees.

It is recommended that you continue to give clinics of this

type throughout your territory and stress the need for

bank officials to become security conscious in connection

with their banking procedures and physical plants.

It is noted as a result of these clinics and

contacts wiin the Bank of Amoniza which has over 960 branches

has

produced an excellent training film which is shown

periodically to all new personnel.

Other banks are following

this procedure and this should assist substantially in

obtaining good descriptive data of suspects as well as

reducing the incidents of bank robberies in your division.

As a result of the passing of the Bank Protection

Act of 1968 most of the banks throughout your area have

installed or are in the process of installing cameras

in most of their branches.

Through the wider use of

bank surveillance photographs shortly after the commission

of a robbery it should lead to the identification of

more suspects.

LEADS IN REPORTS

The leads set out in the initial report in

91-9161 indicate the projected investigation to consist

of reporting results of Laboratory examination, reviewing

State of California All Point Bulletins, maintaining contact

with the San Francisco Police Department and reviewing

solved and unsolved West Coast bank robberies. This same

type of non-descriptive lead is set out in the second report

in this same case.

Similar non-descriptive leads are set

out in 91-9206 and 91-9419.

Leads of this type are unimaginative and of

little value for the

supervisor in evaluating the

projected investigation or for another Agent in having

such a case reassigned to him. The expression of such

leads does not represent the investigative potential of

which FBI Agents are capable and of which the San Francisco

Office has shown in its

solution rate.

Leads such as these

are merely passing our investigative responsibility to the

local authorities.

COPIES OF REPORTS

Three copies of the bank robbery report were

designated in 91-7976, 91-9377, 91-9225 and four copies of

the initial report were made in 91-9362, with no apparent

reason shown or explanation made or the extra copy. All

Agents should be reminded that only two copies are made

in bank robbery cases

in the interest of conserving file

space.

When more copies are dictated

such as multiple leads in several Resident Agencies the

le destroyed and

for a particular need

extra copy should be destroyed and proper notation

made of this fact after its purpose has been served.

CASE SUGGESTIONS

In 91-9395 an unknown white female subject,

approximately 17 or 18 years old robbed the Wells

• Fargo

Bank in Berkeley, California.

The Unknown Subject displayed

a note which note has not yet been forwarded to the Bureau.

This note should be immediately sent to the fBI Laboratory.

security informants familiar with the New Left element in

Berkeley should be contacted.

Inasmuch as this case

involves a young female it is felt that additional contacts

with neighboring newspapers should be made In order to

have her picture publicized more widely than as heretofore

happened.

Also contact should be made

with the Berkeley

Campus Police Department to determine if it would be feasible

to display her photograph to college sources or counsellors

in an attempt to determine if this Unknown Subject may be

a student at the Berkeley Campus of the University of

California.

In 91-9277 it is noted that the individnal who

robbed this bank as depicted in the surveillance photograph

on July 24, 1970, is of excellent quality. Although this

photograph

together with other bank robbery surveillance

photographs appeared

in the "Oakland Tribune", Oakland,

California, 8/3/70, it is believed this is the type of

photograph

that should receive additional newspaper publicity.

It is noted from past contacts with officials of the Bank

of America they plan in the near future to publish in local

newspapers

in the Bay Area a full page ad depicting surveillançe

photographs in unsolved bank robbery cases.

It is

recommended in contact with the Bank of America officials

that this case be recommended as one that they publish in

such an ad.

In addition, any other circulation that can

be obtained through area newspapers should be utilized

in displaying this photograph.

In 91-8825, 91-9267, and 91-9456, all bank

robberies where good

to excellent quality surveillance

photographs were obtained of the individual robbing the

banks.

This individual was responsible for all three

bank robberies. It is noted this photograph has been

published in surrounding Bay Area newspapers but did not

appear in local San Francisco news media, inasmuch as all

MISCELLANEOUS

In 91-9427 it is noted the Subject of this

case is also a member of the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) and was the Subject of a security matter in

the San Francisco Office.

In 91-9405 the Subject was also the Subject of

a Selective Service case, security matter case and an

Anti-Riot Law case

in the San Francisco Office.

These

examples are cited in order to show the need at this time

for maintaining informant contacts not only with the

criminal

element but also with security informants throughout

your division. You should be constantly aware that

revolutionaries in this country have publicly stated that

they intend to finance their causes by bank robberies

and/or armed robberies and this emphasizes the need when

descriptions

and photographs are obtained to distribute

these photographs and descriptions throughout all the

personnel in your office. Agents working security type

cases should be made aware of the need in contacting their

informants to keep in mind that robberies häve been committed

by these young revolutionaries in the past and undoubtedly

in the future they will continue to increase.

Comments of Bank Robbery Supervisor BRYON C.

WHEELER and SAC requested.

It is noteworthy that since the inspectors

arrived in the san Francisco Office an additional 10 previously

unsolved bank robberies have been solved through the

identification of the perpetrators who have been incarcerated

and are awaiting prosecution.

The San Francisco Office

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM AND

INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITIES

PART A.

GENERAL

1.

The commercial or lucrative type of criminal

activity in the San Francisco Division continues to be

predominantly confined to the areas as noted below.

Exhaustive and probative investigation and close liaison

with local state and Federal agencies to date has revealed no

evidence of an organized criminal group controlling these

activities 1andan Francisco or Resident Agency territories.

Investigation contacts with informants and other sources of

information have failed to reveal the existence of any

organized illegal gambling, loan sharking (Shylocking),

labor racketeering or planned bankruptcy frauds.

A.

Local bookmaking involving horse and

sport bets conducted by numerous local

independent bookmakers, some of whom

have established "lay-off" arrangements

among themselves.

B.

Prostitution activity primarily in the

"Tenderloin" section of San Francisco

involving out-of-town businessmen,

tourists, and servicemen with prostitutes,

most of whom are working for unorganized

negro "pimps".

c.

Narcotic activity and related crimes

usually involving thefts and frauds near

universities, military installations, and

"hipple" or Bohemian sections of cities

within the division.

. 2.

This office continues to enjoy an excellent rela-

tionship with the San Francisco Police Department and its

official personnel. Cooperation and excellent relationships

are known to exist between all Resident Agencies and the

local law enforcement agencies in their territories.

NO

evidence or information has been made available to this

office to indicate that there is any corcuption in law

enforcement in this division.

As the Bureau is well aware, Mayor JOSEPH LAWRENCE

ALIOTO was the Subject of anti-racketeering investigation

by this office several years ago, however, this matter has

been closed. ALIOTO prior to assuming the position of Mayor

of the City of San Francisco was a prominent and well known

attorney, particularly in the field of anti-trust matters.

He is known to have been the attorney for TONY LIma, a former

"Boss" of the ICN in San Francisco.

He also represented a

number of other IN figures and their associates.

prior investigation revealed that the cousin of

ALIOTO's father, JOHN ALIOTO,

was the former "Boss" of the

Milwaukee ICN Family.

JOHN ALIOTO attended the inauguration

of Mayor ALIOTO at San Francisco in January 1968.

As a result of an article published in "look"

• magazine, September 23, 1969, linking ALIOTO with many LCN

figures, ALIOTO filed a $12.5 million libel suit against

"Look"

magazine and the authors of this article, RICHARD

CARLSON and LANCE BRISSON.

On May 15, 1970, Federal Judge BRUCE THOMPSON

declared a mistrial in San Francisco on this suit in that

the jury was unable to agree on the key issue of whether

the article linking ALIOTO with the "Mafia" was published

with "malice and reckless disregard for the facts."

jurors told newsmen that the article was defamatory to

ALIOTO and that at least 50 per cent of the 27 points were

indeed untrue.

falsehoods and the article's general claim that ALIOTO was

"enmeshed in a web of alliances" with the "Mafia" represented

"malice and reckless disregard for the facts."

U.S. Supreme

Court has ruled that such a finding is essential to a 11bel

judgment sought by a public official.

"Iook" magazine

and CARLSON and BRISSON.

This article re

ferred to a trip by PAPALE to mexico during which PAPALE met

with FRANK BOMPENSIERO, "CAPO", of the Los Angeles Family of

the ICN residing in San Diego to discuss a lard selling

permit in Mexico for a company of which PAPALE was former

president.

On September 5, 1970, it was reported that retrial

of the ALIOTO $12.5 million libel suit against "look" was

tentatively reset for May 3, 1971.

San Francisco top level

informants currently being

handled consist of four members of the ICN and SSIX' TE

informants in the gambling

and related criminal fields.

OUE

ICN TE informants and ten PC target. informants report on ICN

activities of the San Francisco and San Jose Families as

well as ICN activities in other divisions. Our other TE

informants and our 36 PC targes informants regularly report

on matters involving bookmaking, prostitucion, pornography

and other criminal matters.

AS

an indication of the level

of our informant coverage since last inspaction, SF 2689-C-TE:

assumed the position of

"Boss" of the San Francisco LCN

Family. These informants due to their positions and locations

have made it possible to obtain top level information necessary

to provide coverage for Items 1 and 2.

4.

Since last inspection extensive investigation as

well as informant coverage led to the first ITAR conviction

prosecutions ever in the san Francisco Division (see Item 7

below).

Investigation

in the case CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTIN,

ITWI, case developed a "shakedown" by ECKSTIN against local

bookmaker VICIOR ROMOLO.

This matter arose out of the failure

of ROMOLO to pay a bookmaking debt owed ECKSTIN. SALVATORE

VINCENT "BILI,"

BONANNO, JOSEPH BONANNO, JR., MAURICE PATRICK

HARTIGAN and MARTIN CHEIPETE CARSON acting

as agents for

ECKSTIN attempted to collect the $1,600 gambling debt and

during contacts with ROMOLO threatened him with physical harm

if he failed to pay the debt. This case is currently

under investigation with the matter being presented to

the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco for violation

of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, Extortionate Credit

Transaction

Statute.

It should be pointed out that "BILL" BONANNO

and JOSEPH BONANNO, JR. äre the sons of JOSEPH BONANNO, SR.,

a "Conmission" member of the ICN in the United States.

The aforementioned Subjects are also involved in

a separate ECT case involving the shakedown and threats to

do bodily harm to. WILLIAM JOSEPH ELLIS.

This matter is

presently under investigation and will be presented to the

Federal Grand Jury, San Francisco imnediately upon completion

of Grand Jury action in the ECKSTIN ECT case.

Since last inspection investigation has continued

in regard to GUISEPPI CONFORTE, the reported Vice Iora,

State oi Nevada, Who for years

has headed up a major pros-

titution operation. Through extensive investigation ano

the placement of SE 3239-C-TE and SF 3369-C, this organization

been completely penetrated identifying his lieutenants

'and scope of operation.

As a result of the above, it has

determined that CONFORTE's operation has spread to

the State

of Hawaii being controlled there by one of his top lieutenants,

TOMMY SEALE. San Francisco has under preparation an affidavit

for a request of a Title 3 electronic surveillance on the

phones utilized by this organization in Honolulu.

This Title 3

affidavit has been prepared with the assistance of Departmental

Attorney at San Francisco and who has discussed same with the

Organized Crime Section, Department of Justice, who has advised

that upon completion of current investigation in Honolulu the

affidavit should be immediately submitted for approval.

As another example of the progress made in the

penetration of the racketeering operation since the last

inspection information was received that HARRY JOHN JOHNSON

and ALAN "SUITCASE" FIDLER, :two. Boston "hit men" received a

contract,

reportedly by a printer, to travel to San Francisco

and "straighten somebody out over a union matter."

JOANSON,

a former resident of san Francisco, is known as a former

associate of JACK GOLDBERGER, top local Teamster official

and reportedly JIMMY HOFFA's special West Coast representative.

JOHNSON and FIDLER travelled to San Francisco from Boston in

Januasy, 1970 and through surveillance and subsequent intensive

investigation it was determined that they met with one GEORGE

area a strike situation existed at the San Rafael "Independent

Journal" newspaper involving the ITU.

Through cooperation and

Liaison with local law enforcement, JOHNSON and FIDLER WeI€

arresced near san Raraed, Calitornia and found to be ir

Shortly after the return

Of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the Boston area, an individual who

had knowledge that they had been given this contract was

Found murdered in boston and on his body were found the names

and telephone numbers of JOHNSON and FIDLER. Through these

efforts the attempt by JOHNSON and FIDLER to perform the

conditions of the contract were thwarted. In addition, this

matter is being considered by Departmental Attorney for

possible Federal Grand Jury presentation.

Another example of progress made in the

In the field of intelligence and erganized crime in this aren

resulted when through information furnished by top echelon

informants revealing the presence of ALATADENO JAMES FRATIANNO

residing in the San Francisco territory.

Through investigation

and surveillances conducted FRATIANNO was subsequently contacted

and was developed as a top echelon target of this division.

Frequent contacts were conducted with FRATIANNO and extensive

cooperation was obtained from him concerning organized crime.

FRATIANNO was identified as a member of the Los Angeles Family

of the ICN and during August, 1970 was indicted by Federal

Grand Jury convening in San

Francisco for two counts of

violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 994, ECT. Although

presently incarcerated FRATIANNO is being contacted periodically

as a target in an effort to continue development of his

cooperation.

Increase in penetration of racketeering operations

since last inspection is evidenced by the above examples as

well as the statistical accomplishments reported. hereinafter.

Subseguent to the submission of last inspection

report, through information by top echelon informants this

office,

information has been developed that SF 2689-C-TE

has assumed the position of "Boss"

of the San Francisco

ICN Family®

SE 2656-PC has reported to the return to the San

Jose area Of STEFANO ZOCCOLI, Consiglieri of the San Jose ICN

Family from Los Angeles where he had been residing for the

past year.

During November 1969, SF 2656-PC reported that

GEORGE ADRAGNA, a member of Western Pennsylvania Family of

the LCN was coming to the San Jose area to live.

subsequently,

SE 2656-PC and SF 2689-C-TE reported that ADRAGNA's membership

had been transferred to the San Jose ICN Family and he

currently residing in the San Jose area.

Subsequent to the submission of last inspection

report SF 2689-C-TE reported that JAMES FRATIANNO, a member

of the Los Angeles ICN Family had moved into the San Francisco

•area where he remained until August when he commenced serving

a prison sentence executed by the state of caditornia.

During October, 1969, information was received

indicating that JERRY LISNER, major bookmaker, Los Angeles,

California was in contact with JOHN CASTELLI, bookmaker,

Oakland, California.

The purpose of this contact was for

LISNER to establish

a base of operation, particularly book-

making, for his criminal activities in the San Francisco

area.

Investigation subsequently established that LISNER

and others commenced a bookmaking operation in Alameda and

Contra Costa Counties, East Bay Area, using as its front

A-1 IV Service, Oakland, which is owned by JOHN CASTELLI.

Following extensive investigation in cooperation with the

oakland Police Department, no evidence was developed to

indicate any violation of Federal statutes. On November 22,

1969, the Oakland and Berkeley, California Police Departments

simultaneously arrested SALVATORE J. BERNICE, JOHN TRAPPS and

two other associates who were engaged in LISNER's bookmaking

PART B:

GAMBLING MATTERS

1. In the San Francisco Division there appears

to be two gambling operators that lead all others in terms

of handle, volume, coverage, number of accounts, and

number of employees.

These operators are CARL EZEKIAL

ECKSTEIN and CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., both of whom are

based in San Francisco. While they both handle substantial

individual accounts, ECKSTEIN and LEAHY are primarily

associated with and

rely on lessor local bookmakers

for

"action."

CARL EZEKIAL, ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has been

engaged in gambling activities most of his adult life.

ECKSTEIN was formerly associated with TONY RUIZ and other

San Francisco bookmakers, but in the last year ECKSTEIN

has set up his own independent operation.

ECKSTEIN has been

arrested on several occasions on charges of bookmaking but

has never been convicted of this violation. In 1965 ECKSTEIN

was convicted for failure to pay Federal wagering tax which

conviction was subsequently overturned.

Details regarding

his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3.

CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., a native San Franciscan,

in his middle 40's, has been engaged in bookmaking

activities

throughout his adult life.

He was convicted in United

States District Court, San Francisco, in 1961 for arrest

on 9/28/60 for violation of Title 26, Section 7203, U.S.

Code, failure to report and pay wagering tax, and was

sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation.

Subsequent to his incarceration, LEAHY moved to Medford,

oregon..

He returned to the San Francisco area in the Spring

of 1969 and resumed his bookmaking activities. During his

absence from San Francisco, his ex-brother-in-law, KENNETH

JOSEPH ZAHND, reportedly handled his, LEAHY's, bookmaking

operation.

LEAHY was recently arrested by the San Francisco

Police Department on local bookmaking charges and is

currently awaiting trial.

The types of gambling prevalent in the San

Francisco Division are primarily wagering on horse races

and sporting events.

In addition, small numbers betting

with a weekly drawing take place usually in the Spanish-

speaking communities.

There are also legal and illegal

card games operating usually in low income commercial

neighborhoods. Gambling in the division is conducted by

individual operators who are independent of each other,

except for layoff purposes with respect to bookmaking and

there. are no indications of hoodlum control over any of

these activities.

3. Concerning the extent of gambling in this

division; bookmakers ECKSTEIN and LEAHY, named in Paragraph

1 above, operate in the following manner.

Both are in

daily contact with their accounts located in the Bay area

which include other bookmakers for layoff purposes, split

bookmakers, and numerous individual bettors.

Bets are placed with these operations generally

at locations to which the general public has access,

such

as bars, restaurants, collee shops, ana other smal

shops.

The "action" received at these business locations are in

turn called in to a phone spot operated by a bookmaker who

has a gambling relationship with the operator

of the

business.

ECKSTEIN normally operates with six employees,

including two phone men,

a bookkeeper, a pay & collect man,

and two runners.

The principal bookmakers and

split bookmakers involved in the ECKSTEIN bookmaking

operations are THEODORE CHALMIS, ALBERT DiGERONIMO, ELBERT

HEDRICK, MANNY PRONGOS, and ALBERT CARLSON. ECKSTEIN'S

monthly

handle based on informant data, evidence seized by

the San Francisco Police Department during recent bookmaking

raids, and interviews of bettors is estimated to be approxi-

mately $50,000 for horse bets.

His sports "action" varies

with the season of the year and bettor interests in particu-

lar sporting events; however, ECKSTEIN's handle for sports

action is estimated

to be $40,000 per month.

Since the last inspection, the san Francisco

Office has developed SF 2661-C-TE, who is a key operator

within the ECKSTEIN bookmaking organization.

SE 3036-PC,

who was targeted at time of last inspection, has been

developed to the point where he furnishes detailed

information on a weekly basis regarding the LEAHY bookmak-

ind organization. This target is a

split bookmaker hanaling

"action" for the LiAHY organizaii.

As a result

of information furnished by SF 3036-PC and SF 3237-C-TE,

LEAHY was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department

on 8/4/70 on charges of bookmaking and convict in possession

a weapon.

SF 3090-PC was targeted at the time of the last

inspection; however,

during the past several months, he

has furnished extensive information regarding several

large bookmaking operations.

SF 3387-C was developed since the last inspection

and was responsible for the initial information and identifi-

cation of a major bookmaking operation in the East Bay area,

including Oakland, California, and Naval Air Station,

Alameda, California.

The informant's information led to

the arrest and subseguent conviction of the two major

operators within, the organization in United States District

Court, San Francisco.

In addition, based on informant's

information and investigation by this office, there were

two arrests and convictions effected by local authorities,

Oakland.

As a result of extensive

investigation in the

ECKSTEIN ITWI case, a "shakedown" on the part of ECKSTEIN

against a local bookmaker was developed.

This investigation

has resulted in two major Ect cases involving non-payment

of bookmaking debts which are currently under investigatior

and before the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco.

To

date, eight local bookmakers have appeared before the

Federal Grand Jury and others will be called. This has had

a disruptive effect among bookmakers and has created an

atmosphere of distrust.

6.

Pursuant to instructions set forth in Bureau

letter to SAC Albany 1/27/70 regarding gambling investiga-

tions under proposed SB30, a review of gambling cases was

undertaken.

It should be

pointed out that during the past

three years, it has been the policy of the San Francisco

Office to closely follow the activities of local gambling

organizations and/or subjects in an attempt to develop any

indication of a Federal gambling violation.

Per instructions

additional 162

and 165 cases have been opened and investigated.

Specifically since 2/1/70 sixty-three 162 cases and ninety-

eight 165 cases have been opened.

The La Cosa Nostra (LCN) continues to exist in the Northern

California area and includes a San Francisco "family"

ind a san Jose "family."

There are currently 8 members of the

San Francisco

"family

residing in this division and 19 members

of the San Jose

"family" residing in this division.

In addition,

there are two members of the San Francisco "family" residing in

the Sacramento Division, one member in the Los Angeles Division,

one in the Chicago Division and two members presently residing

in Italy. There are currently 3 members of the San Jose "family"

residing in the Sacramento Division and one in the Las Vegas

Division. All of these members have been identified as members

of the San Francisco or San Jose "families by TE informants

of the San Francisco Division.

Foux top echelon informants of this division who are

members of LCN "families" have failed to indicate that the LCN

"families"

! of this division register any control over gambling,

narcotics, prostitution or any other organized illegal autivity

within this division.

The present leadership of the San Francisco "family"

has recently been assumed by ANTHONY LIMA, who took over this

position when the previous "boss!

JAMES JOSEPH LANZA, stepped

down in his favor.

The "underbogs" of the San Francisco "family"

is GASPARE "BILL" SCIORTINO and this "family" has one Capo de

Decina, VINCENZO INFUSINO, who resides in Modesto, California,

in the Sacramento Division.

The leadership of the San Jose "family" remains the same

as at the time of the last inspection report with JOSEPH CERRITO,

"Doss," PHILIPPO OCTAVIO MORICI and STEFANO ZOCCOLI.

Consiglieris, and one Capo de Decina, EMANUEL FIGLIA. No-ap-

pointment has been made to the position of "underboss" since

the death of the previous "underboss," CHARLES CARBONE, in 1967.

There are presently 8 members of the San Francisco "family"

and 19 members of the San Jose "family" residing in this

territory.

All of these members have been identified by TE

criminal

informants of this division.

and to be aware of and on top of activities of the LN,

it is necessary to identify these recruits. Since the last

inspection, TE informants have identified an additional 1l

recruits of the San Francisco and San Jose "families" residing

in this territory or in the Sacramento territory.

As has been reported above, TE informant: of this office

reported the change in leadership of the '"boss" of the San

ANTHONY LIMA.

In addition, informants of this office reported the

return to the San Jose area of Consiglieri STEFANO ZOCCOLI, who

Investigation by your office revealed the existence

of two ICN "families" within your territory. Membership

Lanza has

recently stepped down as boss of the San Francisco

and has been replaced by Toni Lima.

Your investigation

reveals that Lima's leadership has not been approved by

the "commission."

You should follow this matter closely

so you will be in a position to know all activities relating

"to this change in position.

The second "family" is centered in the San Jose area

and is headed by boss Joe Cerrito.

"family" exhibits

little enthusiasm for illegal operations.

You should closely

follow the activities of members of this

"family" to insure

that any illegal operations are immediately known to your

office.

Organized Crime

Although prostitution, gambling and narcotic activities

exist within your division, there is no indication from your

investigations that these operations are controlled by either

the ICN or other organized groups. Your investigations

should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your

office will be aware of any illegal operations within your

division.

This is particularly true in regard to gambling

activities in view of the recent passage of Senate Bill 30.

You are encouraged to

most desirable trend.

SF 2123-PC (San Francisco file 137-4945; Bureau file

You

advised that contact is being held in abeyance pending a

surveillance which was conducted by the Oakland Police

Department in early 1970.

since this case was opened and the length of time since this

target was contacted he was rated fair.

SE 2630-PC (San Francisco file 137-2967; Bureau file

137-9023) was rated fair.

By letter dated December 10, 1968

the Bureau advised that this target was over two years old

and that you should consider deleting within four months if

he was unproductive.

The only reason this informant is being classified fair

instead of poor is because information contained in your

letter to the Bureau dated September 18, 1970 wherein your

informant reported information was furnished by a TE to

the effect that the present "boss" of the San Francisco

ICN "family" had been discussing leadership of the San

Francisco ICN with the target.

You are instructed that

in the event he does not furnish valuable positive information

within 90 days he should be closed and a more suitable target

developed.

SF 3061-PC (San Francisco file 137-4768; Bureau file

137-17558) was also xated fair. This target along with the

other two targets rated fair should be closely followed for

90 days and be given specific assignments during that period

of time. In the event they are unproductive they should be

closed.

SF 2582-PC (San Francisco file 137-269ô1 Bureau filc

137-8249) was rated poor and should be closed.

In regard to your PCs, the following specific

instructions are being furnished you:

SF 2656-PC (San Francisco file 137-3086; Bureau file

137-9425) was rated good because of his

being close to San

Jose ICN member Dominick Anzalone and Pittsburgh LCN member

George Adragna who recently moved to San Jose.

He is also

close to LCN

"recruit" Vito Adragna. It is noted that this

target has been opened for a period of more than one jear

and has been furnishing general rather than any specific

information.

You should encourage this informant to furnish

some specific information concerning these people who he

is close to in order that he may be retained as a target of

your office.

SF 3318-PC (San Francisco file 137-5545; Bureau file

137-22526) has been a target of your office since December

26, 1969.

Unless your office is in possession of some

specific information to the contrary he should be immediately

interviewed to determine whether he will be cooperative

with your office.

SE 3135-PC (San Francisco file 137-5010; Bureau file

137-19079) was opened on May 17, 1968.

During the two

inspections since he was opened

this PC was rated Unsufficient

Data to Rate.

On November 20, 1969 you advised that an

interview of this PC was being held in abeyance pending an

investigation by the Oakland,

California Police Department.

The file indicates that that investigation was completed on

August 6, 1970 with your target paying a $125 fine.

August 19, 1970 you advised that interview of the target

was being

delayed pending further investigation. You are

instructed that this interview should be immediately conducted

in order to determine if this target will be cooperative with

your office.

• SF 3297-PC (San Francisco file 137-5457; Bureau file

137-22106) was opened on October 17, 1969.

The file indicates

that this target has never been interviewed and you indicate

that contact with the target is being delayed until a more

logical area of vulnerability is developed.

Inasmuch as

this target is over ono your ciù it is feii thai sufficient

information should be developed so that your office might

approach this target to determine if he will be cooperative

with your office.

SF 3192-PC (San Francisco file 137-5016; Bureau file

137-10982) was opened on May 21, 1968.

SF 3110-PC (San

Francisco file 137-2182;

Bureau

file 137-22452) has been

opened since Decemoer 8, 1969. It would appear that

sufficient time has elapsed in order for your office to

develop background information so that an interview of

these targets can be conducted. You should without further

delay interview these targets to determine if they will be

cooperative and if not you should consider closing and finding

more suitable targets for development.

Sas who are working either exclusively or virtually exclusively

on the CIP and IGA program who have not developed TEs.

Although all ten Agents have PCs their progress should be

closely followed to insure their participation in the

development of TEs.

In this regard you may desire to

reiterate provisions of the Manual of Instructions to the

Agents on the program concerning the qualifications of TE

informants.

informants, they are to be particularly alert and not

leave themselves open for criticism or false accusations.

The importance of having an alternate contacting Agent

or another Agent along during the course of certain

interviews is advisable in case any compromising situation

is attempted.

With the recent enactment of Senate Bill 30 you

should concentrate on increasing your informant coverage in

the areas covered by this legislation. Also in regard to

the passage of Senate Bill 30 dealing with gamoling, which

you are aware does not now require interstate activity, you

should not overlook

: the utilization of your racial informants

to furnish information to your office concerning gambling

activities.

Other divisions of the Bureau have been

particularly successful in coordinating the information

from racial informants in to the CIP and ICA programs.

Scalisiival Accomplishments -

During the fiscal year (fy) you recorded two convictions

in the CIP-IGA category.

During the fy 1970 your office had

three convictions.

During the first three months of fy 1971

you have recorded

one conviction in this category.

According to the information furnished by your office

you have four cases pending prosecution, two of which are

in the 159 (IMRDA-IM) category and two are in the 92

(Anti-Racketeering) category. Only one of these cases is

in the CIP-IGA program.

A review of your files indicates

that in file 179-24 in a case captioned JAMES FRATIANNO,

EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTION (ECT), the subject was

indicted under Title lo, section 894 of the u.S. Code.

Your office was working

the case under Anti-Racketeering

classification and the file was opened after the ECT

indictment.

In regard. to the possible statistical accomplishments,

from the above file it would appear the local office of the

United States Attorney will seek indictments under the ECT

statute.

A review of your cases in this category reveal only

three Office of Origin cases.

The files also indicate

• instances

wherein there are shylocking activities among the gamblers

where there are large debts outstanding. A review of your

file 165-100 on Kenneth Joseph Zahna, aka; Morris Cooper,

ITWI, indicates the local office of the United States Attorney

appears to be in no rush to seek Grand Jury indictments on

gambling matters. If the local office of the United States

Attorney will entertain prosecution under ECT and is in

no rush to seek indictments under the gambling statute,

you should review at squad conferences with Agents assigned

to the program provisions of SAC letter 68-46 dated August

20, 1968 wherein provisions of the ECT statute are set forth.

experience has shown a direct relationship between Office

of Origin cases in a particular classification and statistical

accomplishments. As of September 30, 1970 your monthly

administrative report reflects the following Office of Origin

cases in the categories enumerated:

A review of the monthly administrative reports since

has remained fairly constant since the last inspection.

With the increase of manpower on this program and the

addition of informant development since the last inspection

it is anticipated that your office should be in position at

this point to begin to show results in regard to the

statistical accomplishment phase of this program.

Your success since that time has been

noted by the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969.

Also you have added three TEs to the program and seven

additional PCs.

This is to your credit and you are encouraged

to continue this favorable trend.

However, the collection

of intelligence information, though very important, is only

one phase of this program.

The other phase of the program

which must receive close supervision and personal attention

is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's

responsibility toward statistical accomplishments.

In regard to statistical accomplishments, other

In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is

imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show

the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of

In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to

show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given

to the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.

Dissemination

•Your office has been very successful in obtaining

favorable results in dissemination of information to local

law enforcement agencies concerning local violations

developed during the investigation. You are encouraged

to continue this favorable trend; however, you should

bear in mina that vioiaiions thai were strictly local in

nature previously may now be covered by the recent enactment

of Senate Bill 30.

Those which are determined to be Federal

violations, of course, should be prosecuted in Federal

court.

New Legislation

A review of your files indicates you have complied

with Bureau letter dated January 27, 1970, concerning the

then proposed Senate Bill 30.

You should

closely follow

guidelines formulated by the

Bureau in regard to this

new legislation in order that your office wild be abreast

of the latest information so that the Bureau's responsibilities

in the

organized crime field can be fulfilled.

Observations and Instructions

(1) Provisions of Title 3, the Extortionate Credit

I Transaction statute

• and of the Manual of Instructions

concerning the qualification of TEs should be reiterated

to all Agents on the program at squad conferences.

(2) You should stress to all Agents on the program

the necessity of developing quality TEs.

SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS

4-M-5

INSPECTOR IRONE JASON:

The following 'comments,

observations, recommendations

and instructions are being made after an in-depth review of

a representative number of your Selective Service Act matter

cases and administrative files along with conversations with

supervisory and Agent personnel and review of the answers to

questions in a separate yellow (4-M-5) :

The San Francisco area is a

haven to draft dodgers and this undesirable situation will

not be reversed until we make this area unattractive for

"bums, ""hippies,"

and

members of white and black extremist

groups

who come

to San Francisco in order to avoid the draft.

Several obstacles must be surmounted in order to reverse this

undesirable situation.

The indifferent attitude that the

judges have displayed

to date must be reversed towards a

tough handling of Selective Service Act violators.

Supervisory

and Agent personnel must

maintain an aggressive

attitude and

continue to be a leader in streamlining processing procedures

by the United States Attorney's Office and various Selective

Service Boards to insure that these violators are promptly

prosecuted in the courts.

Every technique available to the

Bureau should be used to

get the judges, United States

Attorney and public riled up about this ridiculous situation.

Aggravated violators should be put in jail.

There are 2,983 "hippie-type"

communes in the San Francisco Division comprising in excess

of 20,000 population.

1,050 of these communes

are located in

the Berkeley and Oakland areas comprising in excess of:10, 000

population and 43 communes are known to be violently oriented.

Your office has eight subjects who have committed Selective

Service Act violations that are members of white and black

extremist groups.

Every effort should be made to take these

individuals out ofcirculation by placing them in jail.

Information concerning their activities with extremist groups

should be furnished to the probation officers so that they

can so inform the judges in their presentencing report. All

Agents handling Racial Matters and

Selective Service Act

matters should be periodically reminded to be on the alert

There are several reasons

It is evident from the

backlog of cases awaiting trial (414), backlog of cases

awaiting prosecutive action by the Federal Grand Jury

(749) and the fact that these violations are being re-

ceived by your office at the average rate of 175 cases

per month, that something must be done to get these

sases before the courts.

The most aggravated cases should

be singled out and tried first, particularly those indi-

viduals who are members of extremist groups. Experience

has shown that after several subjects

have received rigid

sentences, and a widely publicized trial, that many subjects

enter guilty pleas hoping for lesser sentences by avoiding

the Government the expense of a trial.

It is recognized the San

Francisco Division has been most forcefully making every

effort to expedite the handling of these cases, particularly

through the judiciary.

Indications are that the relatively

newly appointed United States Attorney is sympathetic and

receptive to the problem and is making an effort to diminish

the backlog of cases awaiting Grand Jury presentations, but

it is recognized once an indictment is returned, it is ther

1p to the judiciary to proceed through the final step, to

which they have not been particularly receptive. They

have

not responded enthusiastically to handling these matters in

Federal Court.

It is obvious the Federal

Judges in Northern California (San Francisco Division) have

resisted any and all pressures brought to bear upon them

concerning this problem.

In my analysis of this situation,

I have determined that the United States Attorney's Office,

personnel of the FBI, and Selective Service personnel have

all attempted to influënce the Judges in handling these

matters more expeditiously to no avail.

Furthermore, within

recent months there has been wide-spread nation-wide publicity

relative to their coddling and minimizing this particular

problem.

This apparently has had no effect upon them.

It

would, therefore, appear that the various Federal Judges

will not react to this problem unless some superior influential

individual or group can forcefully bring this matter to their

attention, particularly if such individual or group is one

which the Federal Judges would respect.

The obvious answer

is the Administrator of the Courts for the Federal Judicial

System in Washington, D.C. and/or Chief Justice of

the Supreme

Court, WARREN BURGER.

HH 55148 DocId: 32989637 Page 393

You are, therefore, instructed

to suggest to the Bureau that the contents of the letterhead

memorandum setting forth this overall problem be brought to

the attention of the Attorney General with the further sug-

gestion that the Attorney General bring this matter to the

attention of the Administrator of the Courts of the Federal

Judicial System and/or Chief Justice BURGER for his analysis

and information, and the further suggestion he may desire to .

communicate with the Chief Federal Judge in San Francisco

relative to these matters.

SAC, ASAC, Supervisory and

Agent personnel should take advantage of

every opportunity

to personally discuss this aggravated situation with the

United States Attorney, Selective Service Board officials,

SAC contacts and other prominent individuals to get them

riled up about this ridiculous situation: Insure that

• continuous close liaison is maintained by supervisory and

Agent personnel with United States Attorney's Office and

various local draft board officials to insure that these

cases are promptly processed and prosecuted.

Your office in April, 1969

suggested to the former United States Attorney that arresting

several inductees on the spot might have a favorable effect

upon lowering the rate of refusals at the Oakland Induction

Center.

The only objection given by the former United States

Attorney was that the case of the registrant must be presented

to the Federal Grand Jury within two weeks after arrest.

Due

to your effective liaison, most of the "bottlenecks" have been

worked out between the Selective Service Board and United

States Attorney's Office in which these arrests can now be

effected.

You should be alert to members of extremist groups

who will

fail to step forward at the time of their induction

and appropriately arrange with the United States Attorney for

authority to arrest these individuals on the spot.

You should

insure that such arrests are given adequate press coverage.

Such plans should be brought to the attention of the Bureau

for their consideration in making a national press release,

if warranted.

You must closely coordinate

Selective Service Act cases with Agents handling extremist

groups such as the Black Panther Party, Weatherman, SDS, etc.

These files

should be cross-referenced by appropriate

memoranda.

Statistical Accomplishments and Administrative Handling of Cases

As of 9/30/70, you had 1,873 origin Selective

Service matters (1,799

74 inactive).

Between

March and September 1970 you received 1,186 Selective Service

Act matters for investigation, an average of 169 (1,186 - 7)

per month.

As of 10/23/70; 1,163 of the origin cases were

completed. 149 cases are awaiting the United States

Attorney's (USA) prosecutive decision, and 414 cases involve

indictments of subjects and are awaiting trial. The case

load is split about in half between Headquarters City and

Resident Agents.

17 Agents are assigned to Squad 6

who

handle only Selective Service Act (SSA) matters and their

informants.

One Agent has been on extended sick leave.

Approximately 18 Resident Agents spend between 60 to 100%

of their time on Selective Service Act matters.

During

the fiscal year 1970, ending 6/30/70, you recorded 74

convictions and for the first four months of fiscal year 1971,

ending 9,30,?P, you have recorded s convictions.

The procedures followed by your office concerning

the immediate handling of subjects who refuse to step forward

at the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, Oakland,

California, appear to save Agent time and Government expense

and should be continued.

Lt is noted, however, that several

months elapse between the time the subject is interviewed and

'the

time the United States Atiorney makes

his prosecutive

decision since he insists that the Selective Service file be

processed and forwarded to his office by the State Director of

the Selective Service Board.

You should have Headquarters

city Agents continue close liaison with Selective Service

Boards and the United States Attorney's

Office to insure that

these cases receive expeditious processing and are presented to

the Federal Grand Jury at an early date.

Current administrative procedures being followed in

these refusal type cases are as follows::

The Induction Officer at the Armed Forces Examining

and Entrance Station, Oakland, California, calls an Oakland

Agent when there is going to be one or more inductees who will

refuse to submit to induction. Inductions are handled on

a Wednesday of

each week.

The Special Agent witnesses the

refusal, conducts a short interview of the subject, and in

almost

every instance

secures

an admission from the Subject

that he knew he was violating the law and that he had thought

about this matter carefully before refusing to step

forward.

The Agent during this interview obtains the Subject's

current address which is generally different from the one he

furnished the Selective Service Board.

The Agent places

the Subject on notice as to what probably will occur as to an

indictment, summons, etc.

The Subject is cautioned to remain

in touch with his Local Draft Board in order to avoid being

a Bureau fugitive.

A case is immediately opened and assigned to the

Oakland Agent who prepares a report.

Information copies of

the report are furnished to the local USA, San Francisco:ano

the field office and the USA covering the Subject's draft

board when located in another division.

It is the USA's

opinion (San Francisco) that the refusal to step forward takes

precedence over any prior delinquencies and will be handled

by the USA, San Francisco. Instructions are given in leads

to Headquarters city Agents and/or

clusely

auxiliary offices to

• follow the Local Board tö insure that all pertinent

information regarding

the subject is promptly furnished

to the USA, San Francisco.

In order to streamline the administrative handling

of these matters as well as keeping the Bureau fully

informed of the activity you are taking in these matters to

insure prompt prosecutive handling, the following instructions

• should be followed:

All refusal cases and all other cases

in which

the investigation is completed should be reassigned to three or

four Headquarters city Agents. These Agents will have

the responsibility of getting these cases to the Federal

Grand Jury and on the trial calendar.

Those cases in which

the subject becomes a fugitive should be reassigned

to another

case Agent.

At the present time there are 1163 cases pending

prosecutive action.

In order. to eliminate status letters and

reports to the Bureau in these

type cases, the following

procedures should be followed.

Memos to the SAC should be placed in individual

files to keep them from becoming delinquent.

When the

Subject is indicted the Bureau should be immediately advised

in

each individual case. Beginning 10/30/70 and continuing

on the 15th and 30th of each subsequent month, you are to

advise the Bureau, by letter, entitled "SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT

MATTERS, SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION" of the activity conducted,

which would include the total number of cases presented

to the Federal Grand Jury during the prior two week period,

identifying each case by San Francisco file number, Bureau

file number and title; the number of cases completed and

awaiting Federal Grand Jury action; number of new cases

received for investigation and general comments concerning

the attitude of the USA's Office and U.S. District Courts

concerning these matters. Also you should comment on any

favorable publicity being given these matters by the local

press media.

In the refusal cases the Bureau should be specifically

advised of the status of a case within five months after the

violation. The USA should be requested to advise of the

prosecutive action he intends to take in each case and this

information reported in the individual file.

It is felt that better liaison can be mainiained

with the USA's Office when only two or three Special Agents

present these cases in a group thereby eliminating 30 to 35

different Agents presenting their cases separately. The

Bureau will be kept advised on a semi-monthly basis of

the activities of your office in getting these SSA matters

through the courts.

The above procedures will eliminate

the dictation and typing of approximately 750 pages each

month.

There are a sufficient number of SSA cases in

Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose and San Francisco for your

consideration of having a Special Clerk handle the

review of Selective Service Board records.

You should

closely review these situations in these particular areas

and if warranted recommendations for hiring Special Clerks.

ADMINISTRATIVE MEMORANDUM

Administrative Handling of Theft

From Interstate Shipment Cases in

the San Francisco Division

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the course of the

inspection of the San Francisco

Office a review was made of 140 Theft From Interstate Shipment

cases.

Instances were noted wherein Bureau Regulations

concerning the handling of these cases were not followed. Set

forth below are instances noted during this review:

In the following cases, it was noted the amount

involved appeared to be a minor amount and there appeared to

be no aggravating circumstances concerning these violations.

In some instances concerning the cases which originated at the

San Francisco Airport, it was noted the file indicated there

was a possibility of an individual at the airport being involved

in the

theft. However, it is felt it is not necessary to keep

open all the minor cases in order to determine which, if any,

employees at the airport may be involved.

These cases where

minor amounts are involved are as follows:

15-11816

cution, conduct no investigation, advise complainant,

and

complainant in writing opinion and action taken."

None of the aforamentioned caros reviewed indicate

you are referring minor violations to the U. S. Attorney to

determine if he would prosecute in the event a subject was

identified.

There were numerous incidents

wherein information

had been received and the file contained no FD-302s and no

indication that the ED-302s had been dictated.

The following is a list of these files which includes

only those files wherein the case is at least 15 calendar days

old. These files are identified as follows:

LY SUPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER: 1) This office received a

54 10/28/70

letter from the U.S. Attorney

dated 6/24/69 wherein the

U.S. Attorney advised that they would not undertake prosecution

of minor theft cases.

The letter set the guide as those

cases of value of less than $100.

This office has been

following the interpretation of minor thefts as those having

a value of less than $100.

It was the judgment of this

office that dout all of the airport theits involved amounts

in excess of $100. It appears that an average loss at the

airport would average an estimated $250, it being noted that

the airline companies currently are paying up to 5500 per

bag.

Therefore, these cases were not judged to be minor

cases and had not been discussed with the U.S. Attorney as

their value exceeded $100. In following this policy San

Francisco believed that they were

in compliance with Section 94

of the Manual

regarding presentation of minor cases to the

US. Attorney.

In the future this office wil? immediately

present cases of the type cited by the Inspector to the

U.S. Attorney before any investigation is conducted and

will consider suitcase type thefts as minor cases.

2) Submission of FD 302s.

Regarding

the fact that I had not detected that FD 302s were not

included in the 25 files listed by

the Inspector, I would

like to explain that 13 of these files were opened

after

September 22 and I had not reviewed any of these files

an

opportunity to detect the fact that the FD 302 was

not

listed.

for review at this time but it is obvious that some of

these files did not have ID 302s prepared:.. promptly.

3)NCIC Entries. Three of the

four files listed where NCIC entries had not been made

had not as yet been reviewed on ticklers since they had been

received in

this office. One of the four files, 15-11994, re-

flects a

suitcase claim check number which is not suitable

for entry into the NCIC.

4) File 15-11981 was recommended

to be opened by the case Agent as he felt that this

shipment involved personnel and circumstances which

would be logically

worked in connection with other existing

TFIS cases and that it might be a lever

for possible

informant development.

The Agent hoped to work this case

even though it was not a Federal violation and obtain an

informant and utilizing the Subject's complicity in the

case as a possible lever.

It was believed that he

could obtain a criminal informant.

I regret very much that it was

necessary for the Inspector to call to my attention

• the

matters referred to in this administrative write-up. I

will

take the necessary action to insure that minor cases

are immediately presented to the U.s. Attorney, that ID 302:

are immediately prepared, that NCIC numbers be immediatels

entered where pertinent

for these matters to be called to my attention again.

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHAROT!

The USA advised this office by

FBI should no longer

present minor theft cases to the USA's

office and that these cases should be deferred to local

courts. The office has followed the policy set down by the

•USA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case.

In view of his policy, the office has not been

receiving minor

theft cases, as the local business community has been made

aware of the policy of the USA and has not been referring

minor cases to the office.

Occasionally some minor case is received from

someone not aware of

the policy of the USA's office in not

prosecuting cases having

a value of less than $100. In the

future when a complaint is received regarding a minor theit,

the case will be immediately presented to the USA and after

his declination, the office will advise the complainant and

the USA's office in writing and where appropriate, refer the

complaint to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction

requirements in the Manus procedure will be in line with the

of Inspection, Section 94.

ADDENDUM

LARSON: In regard to your answer to this

write-up, the following is

pointed out to you:

I. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that

all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts.

This is completely

inaccurate as each case, whether it be

suitcase or otherwise,

has to be judged on the

merits of the individual case.

the review of 140 cases there was not one single instance

wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to

determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not

entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified.

file, the following is

old in which no FD-302 1s In the Ille:

number of files without FD-302's the Agents are not receivin

adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper

3. Although it was pointed out to you wherein

NCIC entries on serial numbers had not come up for adminis-

trative review, it is apparent that several Agents on your

squad have not been properly instructed in the necessity

of immediately entering serial numbers into NCIC.

It should

not be necessary for you to have to remind Agents on your

squad on a periodic file review of the necessity of entering

serial numbers into NCIC.

They should not wait an extended

period of time to enter these numbers in NCIC, but the serial

numbers should be entered imnediately after they are obtained.

File 15-11981 was of a purely local nature and

should have been worked out of the related Federal violation

case rather

than open a

separate TFIS case wherein no

Federal jurisdiction was indicated in the opening serial.

Part II, Section 3, Page 15b,

provides for the procedure to follow in the destruction of

copies of informant channelizing memoranda after the pertinent

information has been incorporated into report form.

While reviewing files during

this inspection, it was noted that copies of channelizing

memoranda are not being destroyed through the use of Form

FD-338 after the pertinent portions of the memoranda have been

incorporated into reports.

In some instances the portions

of the channelizing memoranda pertaining to specific st jects

was ul suûn miñor importance so as

to preclude their use in

As examples, the following files

containing copies of channelizing memoranda which could have

been destroyed after the pertinent portions of the memoranda

had been incorporated into report form:

The growth of many of these

There-

fore, the need to utilize FD-338 is extremely desirable.

YOu

should insure that all Agents handling these matters are

thoroughly impressed with the importance of utilizing FD-338

on a continuing basis. This form can be easily executed when

the Agents are actually reviewing files, serial by serial, in

preparing reports. Many of these security-type files contain

old channelizing memoranda which could have been 'destroyed at

the time previous reports were prepared.

future reports are prepared in these matters the respective

case agent thoroughly review the entire file to destroy those

old channelizing memoranda containing information which had

been incorporated into those previous reports.

During such individual review,

the provisions of Manual of Rules and Regulations, Fart II,

Section 3, Page llc, which provide for the destruction of

copies of serials could also be implemented.

Such systematic individual

approach to the destruction of channelizing memoranda pursuant

to existing Bureau instructions should contribute immeasurably

to the conserving of valuable filing space together with

making these files more manageable.

As you are aware, the

need for additional filing space is constantly increasing

throughout the Bureau.

at all times, and in the preparation of Dally Reports when

recording action performed in connection with a new case, the

title and classification followed by the word "new" should be

Several Instances were also noted in Daily Reports

In the preparation of Dally Reports, it is essential

these forms clearly indicate the nature of work being performed

at any given time.

The use of the particular RA's administrative

file number should be confined to those instances where the

nature of work being performed relates directly to the

administrative operation of the RA.

TREND MEMORANDUM

Improper Administrative Handling of

Security and Racial Informant Files

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the inspection of the

San Francisco Office, a review

of files in the 134 and 170 classifications has disclosed a

number of delinquencies in the administrative handling of

these files.

It was observed that security informant reports

are being disseminated by use of the FD-306.

The informant's

true name is included in the report in accordance with

existing Bureau instructions set forth in the Manual of

Instructions, Section 107G, Page 9, Part 2a9. Some of

these reports also contained the true name of other symbol

number informants. In the latter instances copies of the

reports were channelized to the 134 administrative file

of the informant showing the file number followed by the

symbol. number; however, there was no channelization memoran-

dum for a file containing the true name of either the

informant furnishing the information or the other informant

mentioned in the report.

Due to the tact copies of the

reports are not being designated

for a file under the

true name of the informants, the identities of all

informants mentioned in the

reports are readily apparent

to anyone reviewing the 134 file or any of the 100 case

os the 06

files to which copies of the reports are channelized.

It is essential that the identities of all

informants be kept on a need to know basis and that they

, be afforded maximum security.

In order to avoid the

possibility of disclosing the identities of informants

through your channelization procedures, 100 dead files

should be opened under the true name.of all informants

your office and copies of reports reflecting their true

names should be channelized to these files.

In addition

to attoraing greater security to the intormant, this

procedure will alleviate the necessity or designating

copies of the reports to the informant's 134 administra-

tive files and thus avoid placing unnecessary information

in these files.

The channelization memoranda placed in

the 100 case files for informants should be destroyed in

accordance with instructions set forth in the Manual of

Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 3, Page 15,

Part m2.

With respect to racial informants it was noted

that the name of the informant is placed on the pink

sheet (FD-377) where it is only necessary to show the

serial number where his name appears in the file.

was further observed

that in many instances reports of

both security and racial informants are not being properly

authenticated.

Bureau instructions are that the informant's

code name should appear immediately below the last line

of the report rather than at the bottom of the page.

addition,

In

there were several instances of failure to

indicate on the FD-306 the date that the report was

authenticated by the informants.

Examples of the above delinquencies are located

• in the following files:

134-3251

134-2376

134-1834

134-11

134-1046

As indicated from the above it is apparent that

there is a real need for all personnel conducting these

investigations to change their administrative handling

of informants and information

received from them.

INFORMANT CONTACTS

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON:

Manual of Rules and Regula-

tions, Volume 4, Section 107,

page 6 (da), captioned "Contacts by Agents," sets forth

instructions regarding the contacting of security informants.

It points out except in espionage and foreign nationality

matters where frequency of contact is dependent on circum-

stances, informant should be contacted as often as necessary,

but at least one personal contact should be made every two

weeks.

If such frequent contace cannot be established,

specific Bureau authority should be obtained for the exception

to this reguirement..

170-314

mile reviewing files during

this inspection, it was noted that many of the FD-209s con-

tained in the accurity informants"

files showed distinct

lapses of time beyond the prescribed period of time. As

examples, the below-listed cases failed to indicate that the

informant had been contacted in accordance

with the above

requirements. These files are as follows:

134-3784

134-3740

134-4368

134-4243

In view of the

critical need

for quality security informants in the Bureau's operations,

the frequency of contact is important not only to continue

the rapport developed between the Agent and informant, but

to insure the informant is given sufficient assignments to

insure that his potential is exploited to the fullest. It

is essential that the FD-209 reflect the proper dates of

contacts in order that the close continuous supervision can

be afforded this important phase of Bureau work.

TREND MEMORANDUM

Delay In Opening And

Investigating Racial

Matters

INSPECTOR TOLD C. LARSON:

A review of a number of

pending files in the 157

classification (racial matters) during the course of:.the

current San Francisco inspection disclosed several instances

in which cases have been open for a significant period of time

but tail to disclose any investigative activity. These files

generally pertain to individuals whose telephone number was

either called or was used to make a collect call to the

Black Panther Party Headquarters in Berkeley and Oakland,

California.

The purpose of the investigation of these

individuals is to determine if they are black militant

extremists, and in addition to evaluate their potential as

possible racial informants.

Examples of files that have been

open for a significant period of time withont invectigative

activity contained therein are as follows:

INSPECTOR A'C LARSON

During the inspection a

careful evaluation will

be made as to the adequacy of your Agent complement. Tabulations

have been separately requested (work paper 4-L) covering fluctuations

of Agent personnel complement, case load, case closings, and delin-

quency for the past six months and this information should be care-

fully considered by you in preparing your response.

Set forth the Agent complement which was approved at

the time of the last inspection.

ruw mally Agents have you been able to divort to highor

priority work as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70

in ITSMV and Deserter matters?

If you feel your Agent complement is adequate but not

excessive, you should so state. If you have any surplus of Agent per-

sonnel you should specify and explain. If you feel additional Agent

personnel should be assigned to your office, you should so state and

completely justify by tabulations. and other factors which you think

pertinent.

Add any other comments you feel are pertinent and as the

last sentence of your answer set forth your Agent complement as of

close of business on closest Friday to date this inspection commenced.

Refer to Section 6-M of the Inspectors' Manual for instructions as to

inclusion or exclusion, of Agents under transfer, resignations, etc.

SAC GEBHARLI

REG: hko

(10/28/70))

I have carefully reviewed the detailed study

made and tabulation set forth under 4-L of

the work papers.

The workload in this office,

increased workload,

and particularly the important nature of the

steadily increased in the recent past

and there is no indication that this trend will change in the

near future.

Agent complement at the time of the last

Inspection was

229, excluding, of course, the Agents assigned

to the Defense Language Institute, Monterey.

As of 10/16/70,

Agent complement was 256, excluding those at the Language

School.

• As of 10/16/70, four Agents were

under transfer into

the Division and one was under transfer out of the Division.

A total of 4-1/2 Agents were diverted to higher priority work

as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70 in ITSMV

and jeserter matters.

As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware,

Bay Area of San Francisco has

the

the greatest potential for violence

in the entire United States.

The headquarters of the Black

Panther Party is located in Oakland. In addition, there are

seven

Black Panther community centers and a large

number of

Black

Panther pads

in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In addition to the Black Panther Party, there is

a hard core group of militant, violence-prone New Left

organi-

zations and individuals centered in this area.

It is known there

are many persons in the area who are either Weathermen or espouse

the violent, militant doctrine of the Weathermen.

In addition,

there are 262 individuals who have been connected with the

Venceremos Brigade living in this area and, as

the Inspector

and the Bureau are aware, the Revolutionary Union organization

has numerous members in this area. This office and the present

complement

of personnel have been

and are making every effort

to tultill its responsibilities with respect to the activities

of these violent militant groups.

men have been added to handle these important responsibilities.

It is felt, while we are making headway, one of the prime thrusts

in our investigations of these violent

groups is the

realization

of the absolute necessity to develop live quality informants

within the inner core of such groups so that we can anticipate

their future activities.

As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware, a

Russian Consulate will be operational in San Francisco in

immediate future. Already four members of the Consulate have

arrived in San Francisco, including the Consul and Vice Consul.

It is known three of these four individuals are KGB agents.

There is every indication that, while they do not have a specific

physical builaing as yet,

they

are already conducting business

to

a certain degree out of their hotel and apartments. Our

responsibilities in this regard have already increased and, as

soon as a physical building is established, our responsibilities

will increase tremendously.

As indicated previously, this office is making

every possible effort to fulfill its responsibilities with the

present complement of 256 Agents and will continue to do so,

since this office does recognize the over-all needs of the

Bureau with respeci io

ine assignment of the igent personnei.

ADDENDUM

During the inspection a careful

evaluation was made as to the

adequacy of your agent compliment

10/28/70

bearing in mind the case load,

cases closed, delinquencies and types of cases assigned.

It is fully agreed that the San Francisco Office

is the hub of the Black Panther Party operations which

creates potential for violence.

It also has a concentration

of New Left and violence-oriented individuals and is a

center for Selective service violators:

These along with

your other responsibilitles draw: heavily upon your manpower.

Your division has a unique situation with respect

to Selective Service cases.

As of September

30, 1970, your

office had pending 2,257

cases in this classification. In

analyzing these it was determined that many of these require

very little investigation and 1,163 are either under indictment

awaiting prosecutive action

(A sparial

write-up has been prepared concerning Selective Service Act

cases for streamlining procedures) In analyzing the Selective

Service case load of 1,lll pending cases requiring investigation,

approximately 50 percent are in headquarters city. There

are 16 men assigned to these investigations for an average

case load of 34.4 of cases.

In an effort to determine the average case load of

this office in categories other than Selective Service,

a computation was made by eliminating the Selective Service

Act cases and those agents handling (2,178 pending active

and 27 agents as of 9/30/70). It was determined that the

average case load for the remaining agents was 32.5.

With respect to the work load of the inaividual

consideration in diverting personnel to assignments where

manpower is needed:

one agent was added

to the complement.

Squad 5 pending active case load declined from

655 cases to 508 cases or 16 per cent while the agent

complement remained constant.

As will be noted, the average

case load is approximately 29 and the type of cases handled

on this squad do not appear to be complicated or involved.

The percentage of cases closed during the period averaged

39 per cent per month.

squad iu case load was analyzed for the period

Irom December, 1yb8, through september, 19/0.

The case

load as of the tirst date was 692 cases with 16 agents.

At the latter date there were 773 pending active

cases with

22 agents:

In addition, it is recommended that maximum

utilization be made of the Special Clerk program to relieve

record checks.

Special Clerks for checking Selective Service records in view

vast volume ne

It is suggested that you explore the use of

of your vast volume of cases of this type. Consider Special

Clerks for complaint duty and monitoring.

You should constantly re-evaluate your manpower

situation and make adjustments where necessary to insure

that the Bureau's interests are being

fully carried out.

Divert manpower to priority assignments and make necessary

adjustments through your re-evaluation and realignment to

insure

that the work load is

equitably shared, priorities

emphasized and any deficiencies corrected.

Keep the Bureau

tully informed concerning your manpower and all requests

for additional manpower will be fully and closely scrutinizec

in light of your potential for accomplishments, efficiencies

in administrative and investigation operations

and the

demands placed upon the Bureau through expanded jurisdiction.

ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL

AC LARSON

INSPECTOR

Set forth tabulation of the clerical

complement of your office showing

separately total number of employees assigned to each of following three

categories: "Chief Clerk's Office, " "Stenographic Personnel" and "Clerks

not Available to Chief Clerk's Office, " plus overall total of your clerical

staff. List complete titles and grades involved and in listing Investigative

Clerks indicate whether at headquarters city or if at a Resident Agency, so

identify (see Format page 2). In mentioning resignations or in referring

to employees in the military or on maternity leave, extended sick leave or

special assignment to another division, identify employee by name, title

and grade and state whether such personnel have been replaced and, if so,

whether the overage thus created is to be reduced by attrition.

Describe additional positions established since last inspection and

state whether filling of same was from approved complement or necessitated

hiring additional personnel. In any category where there has been an in-

crease or decrease set forth a specific explanation, including whether au-

thorization for increase was based on such things as (1) need to replace

employee on maternity leave or extended sick leave; (2) increased work

load; (3) June overhiring; or (1) transfer in to relocate employee.

Where

there are increases cite Bureau communications authorizing such increases.

Reconcile any differences between your assigned personnel complement

(total clerical employees shown on tabulation) and your "authorized" com-

plement (total clerical employees approved at the last inspection - plus or

minus any changes since authorized by the Bureau).

Third column of the tabulation should include only those vacancies

you have received authority to fill or that you intend seeking authority to

fill.

If you feel your clerical complement is adequate but not excessive,

so state. If you have any surplus of clerical personnel you should specify and

explain. If you feel additional clerical personnel should be assigned to your

office,

so state and completely justify by tabulations and other factors which

you think pertinent.

the complement of the Chief Clerk's Office has remained

at 82 personnel since 1963. The caseload in the office during

that time has increased from 5,312 cases to 9,024, for an

increase of 69.9%.

This increase. in caseload has caused an

increase

in work in the Chief Clerk's Office

and additional

administrative procedures in the Chief Clerk's Office brought

about by new programs, such as NCIC, New Left, bombing matters

and racial matters, have attributed

to increased work in the

Chief Clerk's Office. There has been a measureable increase of

reproduction of stenographic material which is handled by

the Duplication Unit of the Chief Clerk's Office.

In line with economy measures, consolidation and

file destruction, this office has remained constantly alert

for streamlining

procedures which would insure the clerical

staff being

kept to a minimum and still discharge our many

responsibilities in an efficient manner.

however, it is telt

that an increase in the Chief Clerk's Office complement is

necessary to efficiently handle the continuing responsibilities

and increasing work load.

In line with this, it is felt that

the complement of 82 should be increased to 92. The over-all

Agent-clerk ratio would be minimumly increased from 66% to

it is felt that the present complement of 63 stenographers

The increase of two clerks was due

to the

authorization of two Special Clerk positions by Bureau

letter dated 8/10/70. These positions are deemed essential.

The personnel assigned are adequate and there is no excess.

.. INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON: At the time of the last Inspection

10/29/70 /

your clerical complement was

fixed at 168.

This would include

82 in the Chief Clerk's Office, 63 in the Steno Pool and 23

Clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's Office. .

Since that date there has been an increase of one

in the number of Clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's

Office. This was due primarily to the increase in the Special

Clerk Program.

It was noted that a request has been made for an

additional 10 Clerks in the Chief Clerk's Office.

This matter

will be considered further at the Bureau and you will be advised

of the results.

It is noted, however,

that you are 6 under your

authorized complement in the

Chief Clerk's Office.

An analysis

of your turnover of personnel in the Chief Clerk's Office during

the past two years reflects that your complement has averaged

6 under authorized strength almost constantly. Every effort

should be made to bring your complement up to strength.

Also, your complement of

It should be noted, however,

that elsewhere

In the Inspection Report you have beer

encouraged to utilize the

Special Clerk Program to its maximum to make Agents available

This should be done and it is

1. Which supervisory desk has the responsibility for clerical

recruiting?

2. Identify your applicant coordinator and comment as to his present

volume of work.

Do you feel he should be continued, full time,

in this capacity?

3. How many full-time Agents did you have assigned to clerical

recruiting prior to 6/1/70. Where were they assigned? If

assigned to a Resident Agency territory or road trip, identify

each. Also advise where these men are presently assigned

> and specifically comment as to their present duties.

4. Identify Agents by name and place of assignment (headquarters -

Resident Agency) who were assigned on a part-time basis on

applicant recruiting. What are their present duties?

5.

In the likely event it becomes necessary to partially or fully

reinstitute our clerical applicant recruitment program, how

can this be done in a minimum amount of time in your office?

6. What arrangements have you made to maintain liaison contact

with your most productive sources of highly qualified clerical

applicants?

Field Clerical Eligibility List

1. Set forth number of stenographers, typists, and clerks

currently being maintained on your eligibility list. (Bureau

requires a minimum of 2 stenos, 2 typists and 1 clerk.)

2.

Was each applicant on eligibility list contacted at least once

every 60 days to determine if still available and interested?

If not, explain and identify applicant and file number.

Identify those applicants by name and file number who have

been appointed from your eligibility list since last inspection.

If any were appointed out of order or passed over, identify

Special Agents

There is an urgent need for highly qualified Agent applicants. The

Bureau is particularly interested in obtaining accountant applicants

and applicants from minority groups. Currently there is no quota

on clerical applicants but each office is expected to produce one

high-quality agent applicant per week (one for each New Agents

Class).

Clerical Recruiting

1. The ASAC has the responsibility for clerical

recruiting.

2.

The Applicant Coordinator is SA Harold Wi

Leggett who handles the coordinating and

recruiting of both clerical and Special Agent

Applicants.

It has proven to be a full-time

job in an office the size of San Francisco.

In view of the existing competition between

Government pay scales and those of private

industy, consiant recruiting efforts tis

necessary to maintain the clerical complement

of the office.

He should be continued.

3 .

Prior to 6/1/70, San Francisco had assigned to

clerical recruiting one Special Agent in

Headquarters City plus the Applicant Coordinator.

We also had one agent who spent approximately

50 per cent of his time recruiting, handling

interviews and processing clerical Applicants.

These agents are engaged in the same capacity

of Applicant recruiting today.

4•

The following agents all from Headquarters City

were assigned on a part-time basis on Applicant

Recruiting prior to 6/1/70:

Brent I Palmer, whose present duties concern

espionage matters. (Squad #8)

Willam Re

tenBensel, whose present duties concern

criminal matters. (Squad' #2)

To reinstitute our clerical Applicant

Recruiting Program, should the necessity

arise, we would recontact our many sources

of clerical Applicants and make known to

them that we are once again actively

recruiting.

This would include sources in

not only Headquarters City but also in the

RA territory.

We would also consider

utilizing Special Agents on a part-time basis,

in both Headquarters City and RAs to meet

the needs of the Bureau.

6.

Public and parochial high schools are our most

productive sources of qualified clerical

Applicants.

Individual assignments have been made throughout

the division designating an agent as a liaison

representative with each public and parochial

high school as well as business schools and

collegos.

Also the Applicant Coordinator as well as other

agents appear at high schools on a constant

basis for career type speeches and serve on

career day panels.

San Francisco had a clerical applicant quota of 16

for the period July, 1969, through May, 1970 (at which time

the quota was removed). During that period, 14 clerical

employees

entered on duty.at the Seat of Government.

Your

quota was met or exceeded during 5 of the ll months. It is

to be noted, however, that since May, 1970, 15 additional

clerical employees have entered on duty from San Francisco

as a result of your recruiting efforts expended during the

quota months.

Even though quotas have been removed, you should

continue recommending highly qualified clerical applicants

and should continue liaison with sources in

the event it

becomes necessary to reinstitute an aggressive clerical

recruiting program on a very short notice.

Since June, 1969, 16 Special Agents have entered on

advised that lew Agents' Classes were being scheduled on a

by teletype dated 9/23/70, you were

weekly basis beginning 10/5/70, and eftective 10/14/70, each

office was placed on a quota of one Special Agent per week.

You are reminded that applicants who possess a four year

resident college degree may be considered for the position

of special Agent provided they possess one year of encomnissioned

administrative or investigative type experience.

officers may be considered provided they have at least two

years of military service.

In addition, clerical employees

who posseos a four year resident college degree may be considered

for the

Special Agent position upon completion of one year

of continuous Bureau service..

It is imperative that the Special Agent recruitment

program be given top priority and every effort should be made

to insure that there

are a sufficient number of available

applicants processed

so that your quota of one Special Agent

per week will be met without fail.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

DESIGNATION OF ROTOR

NUMBER ON FILE JACKET

INSPECTOR ARNOLD

C. LARSON:

During the inspection of the

San Francisco Office, it has

been observed that several pending files failed to contain

the rotor or desk number on the file cover.

In those instances

where the rotor number has been placed on the file cover in ink,

it is often small and hard to read.

To facilitate the routing of pending files by

clerical

San Francisco Office, it is suggested that the rotor number

be placed on top of the file jacket with a large stamp. You

should devise a system which would include maintaining a stamp

on each rotor and at the time a new case is opened the rotor

clerk should stamp on top of the file jacket the number of the

rotor which handles the particular pending case.

The adoption of this system would allow not only

employees of the CCO to more expeditiously route pending files

but would also be of assistance to stenographic and other per-

sonnel when they are routing files to the various rotors

throughout the office.

This procedure would specially aid in the routing

of files where the classification is split between two desks

such as the 42-classification.

Comments of Chief Clerk and SAC requested.

CHIEF CLERK SILVERIA:

10/23/70

Inspector's suggestion has merit and will

be placed into effect immediately.

was possibly in Canada and a friend of Subiect's mother advised

in September, 1970, that the Subject is in Canada, but that his

mother does

not have an address for him. The Subject is re-

ported to telephone his mother on occasions. Other neighbors

and police have reported Subject to be in Canada at the present

time.

In view of the above, the following action should be

promptly initiated in an effort to ascertain the location of

the Subject:

1.

Prepare a letterhead

memorandum, in accordance

with instructions set forth in the Manual of Rules and Regu-

lations, Part II, Section 4, page 14 (2) (a) I and SAC letter

INSPECTOR AYOND C. LARSONS

This is a pending case in the

San Francisco Office which was.

opened in July 1969 and is presently assigned to SA JEAN G.

HUGHES. It is supervised by SA H. ERNEST WOODBY.

Extended investigation

has been conducted since

inception of this case in the neighborhood of Subject's parents,

1132 South sage Court, Sunnyvale, California.

When case was

initiated, it was determined Subject's

family had moved from

870 El Camino, Mountain View, California, the address shown on

Subject's DD 553 in 12/68 which was prior to Subject's

reported

absence from the military in 4/69. Subject's

parents have appeared to be cooperative and although present

neighivors of Suject's parents

are not well acquainted with

the Subject, they are cooperative and a neighborhood source

has been established.

Subject entered military service in 9/66 at San Jose,

California, at which time he was approximately 20 years of

age.

Since initiation of this investigation, additional past

residences have been developed for Subject's parents at 278

Lassen Avenue, Mountain View, California in 9/63; 620 East

Mauded Avenue, Sunnyvale, California in 7/68 and 1390 Latham

Street, Mountain View, in 7/68. A neighbor has indicated

Subject may have a brother but

could furnish no specific

information concerning his identity. Attempts to establish

residence at the Latham Street address have been negative.

Mail returned to the U.S. Army addressed to the Latham Street

address indicated a possible residence of Apartment 101, 1617

Pine Street, San Francisco, California.

also indicated past employment for the Subject at Channing

House, Palo Alto, California, for a period not stated.

In view of the fact Subject had already entered

military service betore his parents

moved to their current

address, it is suggested investigation be concentrated in !

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

BOND DEFAULT MATTERS

INSPECTORTARNOLD C. LARSON: AS Of 10/1/20, the San Francisco

Office had 48 bond default

matters under investigation.

This volume of cases presents

a fertile field for increased convictions under the Bond

Default classification.

An in depth survey conducted by the Inspection

Division disclosed that there has been a significant

increase in cases received by the FBI for investigation

subsequent to the passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.

This Act liberalized bail and bond procedures in Federal

cases whereby subjects were to be considered for release

or their own personal récognizance or unsecured appearance

bond in contrast to previous procedures which required a

specific bond, creating an excellent opportunity for us

to achieve statistical accomplishments.

The ratio of

convictions to the number of cases investigated in bond

default matters is one of the highest of any violation

handled by the Bureau.

One of our offices, namely San Diego, has been

responsible for the most significant portion of the Bureau's

convictions in bond default matters as a result of effective

liaison with the U: S. Attorney, who felt that an indictment

obtained under bond default was more easily proven than

the substantive offense. When a subject is

apprehended,

the sentence is, in part, influenced by the U.S. Attorney,

who informs the court the length of time the subject's

apprehension has been sought by the Bureau.

A number of

these cases have arisen through charges of narcotics and

smuggling of merchandise and aliens across the border.

subjects were brought before a magistrate, and rather than

pleading guilty, subjects obtained a court appointed

attorney and entered

a not guilty plea. They

then on either personal recognizance or a minimum bond until

their scheduled appearance.

When the subject failed to

appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, San Diego opened

a case, and usually within 30 days an indictment was secured

under bond default.

Although San Francisco is not a border office,

it is a great port of entry, both by sea and air, and many

of the same type cases utilized by San Diego for

obtaining

a bond default indictment should be available to San

Francisco.

As you are aware, convictions are becoming more

difficult to obtain because of the court's interpretation

of the law in many classifications.

Bond default matters

present an excellent opportunity to increase your conviction

rate, therefore, it is suggested that through your liaison

with

the l. S. Attorney, point out to him the possibilities

tor an increase in convictions under the Bond Detault

Statute.

The necessity to establish effective Liaison with

the U. S. Attorney in bond default matters was set out in

SAC Letter 70-13 dated 3/17/70.

If an increase in

cases and convictions is obtained

as a result of this Suggestion Memorandum, advise the

Bureau by routing slip, attention Inspection Division.

Comments of Supervisor DE JEAN and SAC GEBHARDT

requested.

SUPERVISOR MORRIS M. DE JEAN: Close liaison will continue to

10/26/70k

be maintained with the United States

Attorney's office and all avenues

of potential convictions will be

vigorously pursued to increase the statistical accomplishments

in the San

INSPECTOR

ARNOLD C. LARSON:

This pending case wasopened

on 10/8/70 assigned to SA

CORNELIUS M. SULLIVAN and supervised by SA DAVID E. TODD;

Desk

#9.

On

10/8/70, 1:30 A.M., a bomb which had been placed

in the women's restroom adjacent to a courtroom in the Marin

County Civic Center exploded, causing damage in excess of

$150,000 to the restroom, courtroom #4, and the surrounding

area.

This bombing appeared to coincide with bombings

occurring in the ROTC Ruilding at the University of Washington

in Seattle and the National Guard Armory at Santa Barbara.

These bombings came two days after BERNARDINE DOHRN, speaking

for the Weatherman organization, warned of a

"fall offensive"

by that organization.

A member of the night maintenance crew at the Civic

Center advised he noted a white male in his early twenties,

clean cut, normal dress in the area at 10:20 P.M. He also

noted a white female in early twenties inthe area

in the area, on cited

occasions between 7:30 P.M. and 10:30 P.M.

in the are, on ehzee

This case received wide-spread publicity because

it followed the recent kidnap and murder of Judge HALEY at

the same Marin County Civic Center.

President NIXON commented

on these bombings at a news conference, indicating his interest

in the matter.

SA SAMUEL A. MILLER:

The Inspector has requested my

explanation as to why there was

a delayed investigation and/or reporting in this matter.

I am sorry it was necessary for the Inspector to call this

to my attention.

My investigation failed to identify the

subject ture have not yet dictated a closing memorandum.

I will dictate more promptly.

I/SUPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER: SA MILLER is a very thorough and

experienced all-around, excellent

agent, who has done a very good job in obtaining statistical

accomplishments for this office in criminal matters.

I have

specifically discussed this case with him, and he was aware

of the fact that it was delinquent. It should be noted that

auring the last month and a hali, a majority of SA MILLER's

time has been taken up with the investigation of two bank

robberies and leads in two civil rights cases, all of which

vere treated as specials, and these lactors are,

responsible for this delinquency.

It is regretable that it

was necessary for the Inspector

to bring this delinquency

to the attention of the office, and steps will be taken to

insure that it will not happen

again.

• SAC ROBERT E. GEBHA

I have urged the need for promot

investigation, which did take

place in this case.

I have also stressed to SA MILLER and

Agents' handbook, Part II, Page 12 and 12B,

instructs that at the beginning of an interview with any

known Subject of a Bureau case the Subject be advised of the

name and official identify of the interviewing agent and the

nature of the inquiry.

The fact that the Subject was so

advised is to be recorded in the opening paragraph of the

FD 302.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED:

SA MILLER is requested to explain his failure to

advise the Subject of his name and official identity and the

nature of the inquiry and to record on FD 302 that this was

done.

Relief Supervisor LUEBBEN is requested to explain

his failure to detect this delinquency at the time he

approved the report on 9/3/70.

Comments of SA ANDRESS and SAC requested.

SA RICHARD GUY MILLER: At the beginning of the interview at the

10/27/70

Humboldt County Jail, Eureka, California,

I exhibited my FBI credentials to the

subject and advised him of the nature of the inquiry. I

'apparently inadvertently failed to record this in the opening

paragraph of the FD 302 and on review of this

FD 302 I

inadvertently failed to note this had been omitted from the

FD 302.

Care will be exercised in the future to insure this

does not reoccur.

SA RICHARD

10/27/70

LUEBBEN: I was Relief Supervisor on Desk #6 in the

absence of the regular supervisor and due

to the exceptionally high volume of mail

handled by this desk I inadvertently failed to note the above

omission

from FD 302 of SA MILLER dated 9/1/70 when the report

was signed out by me. Every effort will be made in the future

to avoid a repitition of this delinquency.

SA RAYMOND

MANDRESS: In reference to the report of SA RICHARD GUY

10/27/70

MILLER signed out by SA LUEBBEN on 9/3/70,

SA LUEBBEN was one of the Relief Supervisors

during my extended sick leave during this period. SA LUEBBEN is an

experienced Relief Supervisor and supervises the desk in a very

efficient and commendable manner.

Due to the exceptionally heavy

volume of mail during this time, he inadvertently overlooked the

omission in the FD 302 of SA MILLER. The importance of advising

Bureau subjects the identity of Agents and nature of interview will

be discussed with the Relief Supervisors periodically and will be

followed

closely

to insure this does not reoccur.

San Francisco Office opened

on 7/24/69, assigned to SA JEAN G. HUGHES and reassigned

on 12/8/69,

to SA KENNETH W. SHEETS. Case is supervised

by SA ROBERT D. ROBY.

Review of the file indicates the Subject together

with two other Navy deserters had lived in a hippie commune

in the San Jose area during Angust of 1969. Investigation has

determined that he has used narcotics and has associated with

hippie-type individuals until the present time.

During 8/70, investigation was conducted in San

Jose and investigation determined that one JOAN BAUER was

also residing in a hippie fashion and was acquainted with the

Subject of this investigation as well as the other two Navy

deserters.

On 8/13/70, JOAN C. BAUER was interviewed at which

time she stated she

is employed at National Aeronautics

Space Agency (NASA), Ames Research Center, as a secretary

at Moffett Field, a Navy installation.

During the course

of this interview, she stated she was

living with

a male

individual in a common-law relationship.

She had

formerly

considered herself a member of a "family" of hippies

including the subject and another Navy deserter.

At the

time of interview she advised that the members of this

hippie "family" received mail at her address and the reason

for maintaining the address is to receive food stamps for

this hippie "family" living in a commune style. She stated

their mail at her home and admitted

on occasion taking the

mail to them when she visits the

"family".

This interview was conducted at Moffett Field.

The information concerning BAUER was orally disseminated

to the Security Officer, NASA, Ames Research Center, on

8/13/70.

INSTRUCTIONS

Immediately handle this matter in accordance with

Bureau instructions cited above.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED

1. SA KENNETH W. SHEETS is requested to explain

why he neglected to forward to the Bureau in letterhead

memorandum Iorm the iniormation developed concerning dead c.

BAUER, as required by existing Bureau instructions.

2. Supervisor ROBERT D. ROBY is requested to

explain why, in his over-all supervision of this case, heidia

not detect this error as set out

above.

Comments of SAC requested.

• SA SHEETS:

JOAN C. BAUER advised at the outset

of the interview on 8/13/70 that she

could consider herself a member of the communal "family",

however, this became a matter of interpretation during the

course of interview and eventually she denied she was a member

of the "family" or commune.

She admitted visiting people

connected with the commune

and associating with them, even to

the extent of allowing some of these individuals to

use her

address for the purpose of receiving mail and food stamps.

This matter was discussed at length

•with Security Officer RALPH MAINES and JOHN VAN ETTEN, Head of

Security at NASA, Moffett Field, California. They made no

statement as to what action they intended to take.

I realize now that I should have

also prepared a letterhead memorandum for dissemination to NASA

Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

I regret not having done-so and

in the

future will insure that such matters are promptly

disseminated.

GROS. The case was supervised on the desk of SA GLENN A. HARTER

and was closed on 7/27/70.

BY letter dated 4/27/70, United Airlines Collection

Manager, RICHARD H. GEIMER, San Francisco, made available the

original of three fraudulent checks payable to United Airlines

on the account of KENDALL H. LUTES, Plandome, New York.

TwO

checks were for $50 and one was for $25. UAL advised they

were forgeries.

GARY EUGENE LEGO was subsequently developed as the

Subject when arrested on 5/8/70 at Newark Airport, Newark,

New Jersey for false pretense and possession of stolen

property.

When arrested he was attempting to purchase an

• airline ticket with credit card of K. H. LUTES. An NCIC

check revealed he was wanted by Lancaster County Sheriff's

Office, Lincoln,

Nebraska.

He was released on 5/11/70

on

$500 bond but failed to appear for a hearing on 5/20/70.

LEGO was subsequently arrested on 6/19/70 in

Minneapolis by local police while in a stolen car. Local

authorities held numerous warrants for LEGO and indicated

that they were going to prosecute him. The United States

Attorney's Office in Minneapolis declined prosecution on

6/22/70 and on 7/16/70, AUSA,

San Francisco, also declined

prosecution in view of

LEGO's incarceration

on local charges

by Minneapolis authorities, and in view of the small amount

of checks passed in the San Francisco area. The case was

subsequently closed on 7/27/70.

SE FILE: 100-0

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON:

San Francisco file

100-0-105220 is a

memorandum, dated October 13, 1970, to the SAC, SAN FRANCISCO

from SA RICHARD GALLEN, assigned to the Oakland Resident

Agency. The memorandum is captioned PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY,

SM-PLP. Although SA ALLEN did not designate a specific file

number, he did indicate that a copy of the memorandum should

be disseminated to a 100 case file for LANCEN.

The memorandum

was initialed for the file by Relief Supervisor LAVEN JARDARIAY.

This memorandum contains information from a

Potential Security Informant (PSI) with regard to the Progressive

Labor Party and a demonstration under the sponsorship of that

organization.

The demonstration was led by KENNETH ALLEN

_EPSIEIN, Security Index subject and one of two leaders of the

Progressive Labor Party Student Faction. The PSI indicated

that ERSTEIN was assisted by CARLA NATASHA ROMER, Security

Index subject, and TERRY LANCEN.

The PSI further indicated

that LANCEN had been expelled from the University of California

at Berkeley

and was then residing at 840-47th Street (Oakland,

California).

The memorandum indicated that the office indices

were negative with regard to LANCEN and no additional action

has been taken with regard to this information.

REQUEST FOR EXPLANATION

Relief Supervisor ZAVEN JARDARIAN is requested

to explain why he did not open a case in order to at least

identify LANCEN in accordance with existing Bureau instructions.

The Manual of Instructions, Section 87D, Page 19, indicates that

where there is doubt as to whether an investigation should be

conducted with regard to individuals who possess revolutionary

beliefs, it should be resolved in the interest of security

and investigation conducted.

SA JOHN A. GARRETT:

SA DONALD L. COFFIN and I attempted to

interview DAVID CHARLES LIPPMAN in the

Berkeley, California City Jail on April 16, 1970.

SA COFFIN

promptly

advised LIPPMAN, of the identity of the interviewing Agents

and presented the Waiver of Rights Form (FD-395) to LIPPMAN at

which time he indicated that he would neither sign the waiver

form nor would he consent to

be interviewed without his attorney.

•It is my recollection that a waiver form was prepared on April

16,

1970, and I cannot account for the fact that this file does

not reflect same in the lA exhibit envelope other than

a case was

being opened on the subject and that the waiver form was misplaced

upon submission. SA COFENNand I inadvertently failed to prepare

an interview log in this matter.
