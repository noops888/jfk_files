UP” aNGELIE stated that he knew PRISCILLAKPOSTQuNSON
and ROBERT W. We [BSON by face, but never associated with them~
in Russia. H -He.reca that he may have talked to GIBSON in
a general security orientation session before GIBSON reported

Russians in view of the fact his-wife~had left him a bachelor
because of marital troubles. LANGELLE does not recall that
GIBSON mentioned anything concerning SOCHUREK or any. other
correspondents during the security orientation session ¥@7

LANGELLE explained that he exercised no, authority
over any Americans who were not employed at the United States
Embassy. He said that he could not order these people to do
or to refrain from doing anything. He could only talk to
them informally at their own volition. Therefore, he was Ace
unable to call in SOCHUREK for an interview even if he had ae
desired to do so, u) sy

to his 8/14/59 letter to the Department of State and he
thought that if he had received a reply he would remember
it. He had no knowledge what, if any, action was taken by
the State Department upon receipt of his letter. He was
sure a copy of his letter reached CIA through the Security
Office of the State Department (S] (4)
