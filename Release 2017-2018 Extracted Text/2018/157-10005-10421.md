On January

after a the start asked for access to the Amlash Eile at CIA; and

delay which was not explained, the staff was permitted to

reinew the file on January 23 and 26.

Summary of Amlash File

Amlash initially contacted by CIA in 1961 met occasionally with

case officers through August 1962, at which time he was given instruc-

tion in secret writing and explosives. Interest in Amlash continued

after the August meetings, but there was no further direct contact by CIA

agents until mid-1963.

Why there was a year lapse in contact with Am-

lash cannot be determined; the Cuban missile crisis

in October 1962

undoubtedly made ClA cautious in dealing with Amlash.

In any event, DIR 48198*

to

of 19 June 1963 states that

Anwhip,

had sent a letter as part of

an "activation errort to reluctant dragon." Presumably, Amlash was

"reluctant dragon" and was, by this letter, asked to recontact CIA.

In late August, Amlash traveled with a large contingent of Cuban

officials and athletes to

ways of getting rid of Castro.

At the conclusion of the meetings with Amlash, Headquarters

cabled on 9 September that, based on

what little feel Headquarters

had, Amlash appeared hopeless as an intelligence performer and should

a chief conspirator allowed to recruit his own co-

horts. He should be urged to recruit a

On October 15,

to DIR states case officer O met with

Amlash and Anwhip

on 13 October.

Although the case officer had been

forewarned by Anwhip, he was not successful in discouraging Amlash's

request for a high level meeting.

"Amlash convinced that if such meet

does not take place at this time it will be almost impossible come out

again and we will be in same situation as last year with no definite

decision.

Also finds it difficult

to believe why RiK who receives many

Cubans would refuse to see a major" such as Amlash. The message notes

the fact remains that Amlash does "have excellent entree to highest

target level which believe we cannot afford overlook.

This message seemingly moved Headquarters to re-evaluate Amlash's

role. DIR 75683 to

Jon 15 October directed case officer 0 to

return headquarters soonest for discussions of all phases of the case.

The next meeting apparently took place on October 29. One case

officer met Amlash holding himself out as the personal representative

of RFK.

He informed Amlash, according to a 13 November MFR, that

the U.S. was prepared to render all necessary assistance to

any anti-

communist Cuban group which succeeded in neutralizing the present Cuban

leadership and which assumed significant control to invite the U.S.

to render assistance.

He emphasized that U.S. support could come only

disintegrate.

but desired to know what technical support he could get.

Since Amwhip was closer to Amlash than the case officers, he was

asked about Amlash's reaction to the

meeting.

His reactions are

summarized in Attachment A to Anwhip's Memo of Meeting dated 14 Novem-

Anwhip said Amlash was still not pleased with support from U.S.

government.

Amlash had accepted the fact he had to

work with the CIA,

but ClA might lose him if it continued to procrastin-:

Amlash talked about going to the french

the OAS, but realized that was not feasible.

The memorandum ends with

what apparently is the author's conclusion:

"It is hoped that he does

In a Memo for Record dated 19 November, one case officer summarized

the actions to be taken at the next meeting with Amlash.

Amlash was

to

be told the U.S. was prepared to give full support to Amlash's coup.

He would be shown President Kennedy's speech in Miami of November 18

and told this reaffirmed support for Amlash's proposal. Headquarters

nad approved giving Amlash scopes

and rifles

and other

equipment.

The

nemo ended by stating that "C/SAS* requested written reports on Amlash

operation be kept to a minimum."

to DIR of 20 November indicated Amlash had been called

on the night of November 20 and had agreed to postpone his return to

Cuba in order to see case officer O "if it something interesting."

CIA officer said he could not assure it was interesting but that it was

to be a meeting which Amlash had requested.

(Obviously, CIA wanted to

give Amlash the "technical support"

he felt he had not been promised in

the 29 October meeting.)

Case officer O flew from the U.S. so as to arrive in

on the morn-

ing of November 22 for this meeting.

to DIR received at Langley at 6:25 a.m. on 23 November

is the only message in Amlash's file reflecting the fact the meeting

had taken place.

It indicated that Amlash was anxious to return to

Cuba and that case officer O was to arrive in Washington at 1810 that

day.

The file contains no outgoing cable to

on November 23 or

any other time telling

to break contact with Amlash.**

On 25 November, a contact report was prepared.

There is reason

to question the authenticity of this document which is three pages

and reports the 22 November meeting with Amlash.

also promised arms which will have to be furnished through

JMWAVE's operations.

A series of confusing cables passed between Headquarters and JMWAVE

on December 6, 1, and 8.

Apparently, Headquarters first gave JMWAVE

authority to drop a cache of arms in

Cuba.. Then Headquarters called

off the operation.

In DIR 87615 of 7 December,

it is noted "major

top level Cuban/Caribbean policy review scheduled early next week which

should provide basis for decision."

JMWAVE complained about the

change in orders in a cable of 8

December. JMWAVE 8702 pointed out that one Headquarter's message

indicated December infiltration operations were approved by higher author-

Ity but a second message indicated a scheduled operation should be de-

layed and not run in December.

Headquarters responded in DIR 87880. Headquarters procedure

was to present infiltration operation plans to

"higher authority"

even though there is a reasonable chance operation may be postponed

or delayed as was case with the scheduled operation.

"This procedure

will secure approval for the operation with only telephonic reconfirma

tion needed when previously relaxed operation finally mounted."

Head-

quarters recommended delay until January after considering and equating

objectives against risk factors for Amlash and others.

January,

By

of 13 December, Paris reported that Amlash left

for Prague on November 27 but did not seek recontact with case

officer.

DIR 90966 to JMWAVE of 23 December reported that Havana radio

on 2 December stated Amlash arrived Cuba on 1 December.

The last document in Amlash's file for the period ending December

1963, is a long report on Amlash, but it does not contain information

relevant to the October-November

activities.

Nevertheless, in red pen

One later document in the Amlash file contains more information

about the November 22, 1963 meeting.

That document, a rough draft of

3 biographical information sheet on Amlash (no final draft was found)

appears to have been prepared in 1966 at the time of Amlash's arrest

and a later plot sundaeet that states

"22 Nov. 63 Mr. Fitzgerald

assured subject that this Agency would give him every-

thing he needed (telescopic sight, silencer, all the money he wanted).

The situation changed when

and Mr.

Fitzgerald left the meet-

ing to discover that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Because

of this fact, plans with subject changed and it was decided that this

This

included the following.

'We would not furnish the silencer, nor scope

nor any money for direct assassination; furthermore, we would not lift

assassinate Castro."

The same document states this message was communicated to Amlash

in November 1964 by

Despite this decision, the CIA in fact continued to assist Amlash

through a cut-out until Amlash's arrest in 1966.

Later documents on Anlash are also relevant to the September-

November 1963 Amlash operation.

Several

such documents report informa-

tion received to the effect that Fidel Castro had long been aware of

Amlash's plots against him.

For example, Amlash's one time Cuban

mistress was believed to be working

for Cuban intelligence and her

brother was

Cuban operations had been penetrated at a high level by Cuban intel-

exiles who was knowledgeable of a number of the most important opera-

detalled analysis ge, Amlash's file contains nothing to indicate any

possible penetrations of the CIA's Amlash

operation,.

although a cryptic handwritten note on at least one re-

port rejects the suggestion that Amlash was himself reporting to Castro.

One other document bears on the testimony Amlash's case officers

gave before the Select Committee to the effect that Amlash was given

a poison pen for self-protection.

That document reports that Amlash,

and other Cuban officials in Paris in 1963, were carrying pistols for

self-protection throughout their travel in

'Europe.
