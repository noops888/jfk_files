his blography, NOSENKO's

entire adult life until defecting had been spent

& student or as an intelligence officer, and in explanatios

of bis lack of positive intelligence information, he has

stressed that sirce the early 1950's he had

interests and "no real contacts" outside the KGB itself.*

NOSENKO's assignments to the Sovlet delegations to the

Disarmament Conference in 1962 and 1954

were, he hes sald,

for cover purposes only. and he aeither lad

any connections

with officials or organizations

in the USSR concerned eith

arns control or disarmament policies nor did he take any

part in the substantive work of the delegations.

During the period 18 to 23 February 1964, & wide range

of questions covering various aspects of nuclear weapons,

missiles, electronics, communications, unconventional wea-

pons, military industry, military units and equipment, and

research and development were put to MOSENKO in order to

evaluate his knowledgeability.

He had no direct knowledge

of any of these topics,

although he was able to identify in

general a few

of the KGB organizations which protect sensi

tive instollations such as cuclear weapons production and

storage sites.

NOSENKO was given a set of requirements

fron the Defense Intelligence Agency on 24 February 1964.

These questions were premised on his two TDY tours to the

Disarnament Conferences in Geneva; thuy dealt with such

matters as Soviet underground testing, Soviet efforts and

progress in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,

Soviet ains and purposes at the disarmament talks, and

Soviet views of the corresponding attitudes and intentions

of the United States.

NOSENKO stated he had us. information

on any of these questions but expressed his personal opinion

on a few of them,

in general terms.

NOSENKO's answerg to

other questions

of a positive intelligence nature--those

concerning the viability of the current Soviet leadership.

plans for a ser Soviet constitution, anti-Semitist as

governmental policy, personality data on Soviet lcaders,

and other political

and social matters--were couched in vague

and general terms and were not based on concrete knowledge.

*At the start of his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962.

however, when explaining how he knew of the real state of

affzirs

inside the USSR

(as opposed to that presented by

Soviet propaganda), NOSENKO

said:

"I circulate among

ministers, with the friends of my father, and I bear

what they say."

C. KGB Headguarters

1. Structure and Functiong

Prior to NOSENKO's contact with CIA in June 1962, tho

most recent information on KGB structure and functiong had

been provided by GOLITSYN, whose information was current as

of December 1961 when he

defected.

GOLITSYN'g data and that

from the Polish defector GOLENIEWSKI wero the first detailed

new information on this subject available to the U.S. intel-

ligence community since 1954, when DERYABIN, RASTVOROV,

PETROV, and KHOKHLOV defected, just prior to the change-over

from the Ministry of Internal

(MVD) to the Committee

for State Security

GOLENIEWSKI and GOLITSIN nad re

ported on the 1959 reorganization of the KGB, the first major

realignment of the KGB's functions since the

abolition of

the Committee

for Infornation in 1951.

It encompassed the

absorption into the Second Chief Directorate of the duties of

Fourth, Fifth

and Sixth Directorates. which had

been responsible for political, econonic-industrial, and

transportation security, respectively.

It also included the

upgrading of the Illegals Department to the status of a

Special Directorate within the First Chief Directorate, the

of counterintellizence operations abroud into

one new department, the

Fourteenth, and creation of a new

department -Department "D" (Disinformation) --to .coordinate

and intensify the KGB's activities in the area of deception

and nisinformation.

although placed in the First

Chief Dircetorate, was established to serve the needs of the

entire KGB.

NOSENKO's 1964 information on the organization and func-

tions of the KGB indicated refinements of

responsibilities

in the Second Chief Directorate in accordance with the 1959

absorption of the fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Directorates.

The formation of the so-called

"Service" (Sluzhba) as a

component of tle Second Chief Directorate centralized those

political security functions (formerly handled by the Fourth

Directorate which were unrelated to

foreigners in the USSR;

the creation of an element entitled "the Directorate" (Uprov-

for industrial-&conomic

functions formerly managed by the Fifth and Sixth Dircctorates.

As for the First Chief Directorate, NOSENKO reported the up-

grading of the Scientific and Technical Départment to direc

torate status, and the expansion of the Information and

Counterintelligence Departments to L'Service: Number:1' and "Ser-

vice Number 2,"

respectively; according to NOSENKO, the

latter organizational designation permits an increase in

personnel without a corresponding rise in the bureaucratic

level of the component.

The accompanying charts offer a comparison of the or-

ganization of the KGB in 1961,

as known from GOLITSYN (and

supported by GOLENIEWSKI), and in 1964, as given by NOSENKO.

Comments on particular weaknesses in NOSENKO's information

on the KGB organization since its formation in 1954 will be

found in Part VII. B.l., Statements of DERYABIN.

2. Modus Operandi

Less measurable or precise in comparison with KG

structure and functions are the operational methods and

Headquarters procodures of the KGS.

SOSENKO himself has not

been

as productive in revaling Tourist Departrent rethods

as

was

the document which he provided on this subject in

1964.

He has not been

able to provide a systonatie, detailed,

or documented review of the methods of the other second Chiet

Directorate component to which h. was assigned,

the U.s.

Enbassy Sectior, not of the nothods of thr Surveillance

Directorate with which he worked closely.

JOSESKO neverthe-

less has

furnisted insignts into the L.S. Enbassy Section

and Surveillance Diriciorate nethuds in the course of dis-

cussing specific operations.

JOSESKO brought to ti Genera meetings

of a report to the Colligion of th+ KGB dated March 1963 on

the work of

Tourist Departmert of the Second Chief Direc

torate.

Ile claimed to nave

written at hinself, and it bore

corrections

in his handüritirg.

This draft descrihed KCB

investigations of

and operations against lestern tourists

suspected of being agonts of forcian intelligence services,

primarily in the

periud or 1961-19n2.

It described the

functiors of rach

component of the Tourist Department and

the number ard qualifications of the operational staff,

giving figures on length of service, educational background,

foreign travel and languages, and training.

It went on to

cite statistics on the number of foreign tourists visiting

the L'SSR, and

the number of foreign agent susprets uncovered

among them through the

work of the KCB.

A wid. variety of

techniques used by the Tourist Deparinent were mentioned,

with cramples of certain successes

interspersed in the

discussion.

NOSENKO has

made

numerous references to the techniques

described in this report,

as discussed in

the many

cases

reviewed in detail

in tne foregoing treatment of his KGB

career.

When interviewed for further information on the

statistics which appear

throughout the 1963 draft, however,

NOSENKO was unable to identifj the oporations referred to in

the numerical citations, nor those included as illustrative

examples of operational techniques.

TOP SECRET

---

## Page 13

we 160.0

The document refers

also to the role of the leadership

of the Tourist Department in briefing other organs of the

KGB on work against foreign tourists.

NOSENKO was questioned

on this activity but ould

any information contained

in such lectures or discussions.

Although the cocument also

emphasized the daily need for coordination of the Tourist

Departnent activities with numerous other components of KGB

Headquarters and with local organs of the KGB throughout the

Soviet Union,

NOSE"KO was unable to explain how

such coordina

tion was effected in practice, nor could he describe require-

ments for the preparation and

approval of correspondence

pertaining to such coordination; in many instances he asserted

that telephone calls sufficed, but he said he could.not indi

cate who was authorized

to coordinate informally in

this way.

Apart from this information on Tourist Department modus

operandi, NOSENKO has described the operational methods of

the V.S. Embassy Section of the Anerican Department and of

the Surveillance Directorate in connection with their coordinated

activities against Embassy targets.

Of particular note is

Part V.E.3.c., in discussions of operations against Embassy

code clerks.

3.

Staff Procedures

In recounting verious operations

in which he participated

or which ne supervised, NOSENKO described operations and

events which encompassed various KGB procedures.

these were:

authorization for recruitnent; file checks;

correspondence and coordination with other KGB departments,

directorates,

or regional units; technical support of opera-

tions; adsinistration of safe houses; KGB files

and travel authorizations and accountings.

to time asked to describe such procedures systematically and

in detail.

From such questioning it was not possible to

derive any detailed picture of current KGB procedures.

little NOSFNKO was able to provide did not differ from infor-

mation dated 1954,

and was only a small fraction of the infor

nation available from earlier sources.

He had no information

on changes.or developments in the interim.

Examples of the

level of YOSENKO's knowledge of certain procedures may be

found in Part VII.B.1, DERYADIN'S Conments, as nay instances

of tnaccurate reporting of procedures.

D. KGB Activities

1. Operations Against Americans

In the context of kGs recruiteent operations and investigations,

NOSENKO has mentioned 11l Americans:

forty-nine of them were said

33 were

to have been recruisedith the koa; investigations

under development, and

seven re

fused to collatorate

the

remaining 22

Americans were reportedly predicated on XGB sus

picion or knowledge of their affiliation with U.S. Intelligence.

Of the 49 Americans

recruited, #OSENKO attributed his knowl-

edge of nine of them to

his

owr. direct, personal involvement in

the approaches, usually

as recruiting officer;

these cases are

discussed at greater

length in connection with NOCENKO's KGB

career (Part.').

His knowledge of l1 other recruitments

was said

to have derived irom either indirect involvement or contact with

the targets of these operations; NOSENKO inuicated that he be-

came aware of these il persons

through his duties at various times

in the America: and

Tourist Departments of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

(pecause of interest in Americer correspondents

during 1954

and 1955 while in the American Department, for exam-

ple,

he was able to report that five of them were KGB

agents, al-

though he had taken

no

part in their recruitments, which had

been

achieved earlier; likewise

he learned of two recruitments when

an American Department officer twice visited the Tourist Depart-

ment with a request for operational assistance during 196? and

1963, when NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of this department.) In

four

cases--all First Chiet Dircctorate operations--NOSENO said

he lcarned

of

the recruitments unofficially from discussions with

friends and fron remarks by other case officers which he over-

heard.

Two of these

four cases were considered by NOSENKO to be

mong his most significant information,

the penetration of the

Orly Courier Transfer Station by U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Lee JCHN-

SON and the recruitment in Moscow and later handling of code-

machine mechanic Dayle W. SMITH; detailed information on the

JOHNSON

and

SWITH

cases 15

presented after the tabulation (below)

of NOSENKO'S American leads.

NOSENKO has provided no sources for his information on 25

of the 49 successful KGB recruitment operations against Aneri-

cans, although he has sonetimes identified the case officers in-

volved in them; most of this information was contained

in handwritten

notes, which NOSENKO carried to Geneva

in 1964.

According to SOSENKO,

he learned of these cases casually while Deputy Chief of the Tour-

ist Department during 1962 and 1963; many of the recruitments were

said to have been accomplished in 1960 and 1961 at a time when

NOSENKO was serving in the American Department.

He has explained

these notes as follows:

don't know much about it.

"If i did not participate in a case when

Please understand me.

Since 1962

I first began to get ready for this act (defection), any time

got a whiff of something which smelled like an

agent, I would

put

it down. I have a regular safe in my office and then I have a

hidden wall safe.

There I may put my personal

papers, notes.

am the only one who has a key and any little notes, like those

mentioned, I hould put in there."

SEREBRENNIKOV was convinced

Therefore, he re-

Of NOSENKO's leads to Americars recruited by the KGB,

were thres who, he indicated, had access to

classified U.S. Government information at the time

he first reported

These three cases--

"SASHA", "ANDKEY" (Dayle W. SWIill), and zhe penetra-

his case officer's insistence he thought

further about the question and finally said:

"I do not know of

any in ClA, but there 1s one in your military intellisense.

This

one worked

in Germany and then returned to America in 1955, and

then after 1955 he worked in Germany.

He explained that he had

first learned of this case

from M.A. SHALYAPIN, who had been the

case officer

NOSENKO added that

"SASHA" returned to

the United States in

the 1960's, then specified i962, and returned

to Gernany again after that.

February 1964, talking about anocher matter, NOSENKO

had remembered something that might help to identify

"SASHA." He had heard that the KGB had not had luck in getting

intelligence from high places in the U.S. Government during the

Cuban missile crisis in late 1962.** SHALYAPIN had

that-- despite NOSENKO's

recruited some time

NOSENKO:

I tell you I was not working on this case. He was

recruited in 1949-1950.

Question:

When did he leave Moscow?

NOSENKO:

He left in 1950.

It seems so, Yes. He said that he

would not work in the USA.

NOSENKO went on to say that "ANDREY" was the cryptonym

assigned to the agent by the Second Chief Directorate at the time

of is recruitment.

Although NOSENKO was not sure of the dates,

he was certain that this man, a U.S. Army Sergeant, had been

for the KGB by Roy RHODES, whose KGB cryptonym was

"QUEBEC".

RHODES was stili an Moscow when "ANDREY" was -e-

cruited; he had told the KGB

about many other U.S. Embassy

employees, including military personnel, and the name

"ANDREY"

would mean nothing to RHODES because he

did not know that the

KGB had recruited this man.*

The mechänic worked

satisfactorily in Moscow for the KGB,

providing materials and information on ciphers.

"ANDREY" pro-

mised he would cooperate with the Suviets in future assignments

abroad, but would not work with them in the United States as he

did not want to "sit in the electric chair."

he was paid well

for his cooperation in Moscow,

and the Soviets wanted to pay

him more but he refused to accept it because he said he couid

not plausibly explain the possession of too much money.

KGB offered him diamondsand other gems for later sale, he

did not take them, telling his case officers that possession

of a large diamord of more than a carat in the United States

could arouse the attention of the police.

In 1950 the agent

left Moscow for the United States, and the KGB waited for him

to reappear in some other country, but he did not.

Finally in

1955 the KGB sent an officer, who had participated in the re-

cruitment of the agent in Moscow, to the United States for the

purpose of finding "ANDREY" and the officer had no other

case, records were checked for the dates of RHODES' assign-

ing to RHODES,

the date of his own recruitment by the KGB

was January 1952.

When these dates were cited to NOSENKO

on two separate occasions during the 1962 meetings he

changed the original date for the recruitment from 1949

or 1950 to 1952 or 1953.

In 1962, as well as in 1954,

he said he was certain

that the recruitment had already

The KGB Agent in Paris (Sat. Rober: Lee JOHNSON)

Irtroduction

The lead to the penetratior of a sensitive U.F. military

installation in the Paris area during 1962 and 1963 was the first

plece of irformation NOSENKO gave CiA after reestablishing con-

tact in Geneva in January 1964.

NOSENKO characterized this lead

then and later as the most important single counterintelligence

item that he had acquired during the year and a hale ho had been

a CIA collaborator at KGa Headquarters in Moscow; the subject of

the liad had provided the KGB with significant documents, some

of which has been

shown to Premier KHRÜSHCHEV personaily.

nevertheless had lost access to the sensitive information some

norths sarlier.

agent may have earlier performed for the KGS and estimated that

Paris "in case he will get access açair come time, even just a

NOSENKO's statements concerning this lead

arE given in chronological order below..

NOSE::KO said at the 23 January 1964 meeting* that. he first

learned of the successful agert penetration of tre classified

documerts sault at an

"important American military organization"

1n she Paris area shortly after returning from Geneva in June

NOSENKO did not knew the designation or precise nature of

the instaliation involved in this operation: but because the

documents irclued information on strategic targets in Franse a8.

well as in the Soviet Union, he assumed that it was a "strategie

planning irstallation."

He also knew that the installation had

our airfieid

that there were "procedures for bringing top

secret documen's in and for taking them out."

There had been six successful entries of the vault, four

in 1962 and two in 1963.

On each occasion Special Section tech-

nicans had travelled TDY to Faris under courier cover to assist

the local KGB case

officer in the technical details of the opera

Their function was to advise the case officer. concerning

the entry and later to process the documents.

The case officer,

on this basis, vould give appropriate instructions to his agent,

and it seemed probable to NOSENKO that the technicians had never

met the American.

Entry into the vault crea was first achieved after the

agent had used some radioactive substance to determine the com

biration.

(NOSENKO thought that the agent had also photographed

the lock for KGB study.)

Subsequent entries were always made

berrein two and five o'clock in the morning.

The agent removed

documents fiom the vault and delivered them

to his case officer,

who in turn passed them to the Special Section techricians.

envelopes were then opened, photographs were made, the documents

were repackaged, and the envelopes were given back to the agent

by the case officer for return to che vaule.

Thereafter,

technicians themselves left Paris until the next opportunity

agent was scheduled for rotation to the United States but, with

his promotion, had obtained an extension until May 1964.)

though the agent was still active in January 1964 and was still

assigned to his military post, he therefore had lost access to

the documentary information.

NOSENKO characterized this in

formation as highly sensitive and valuable to the KGB,

that the Chief of the Paris Legal Residency as wall as several

case officers there had been rewarded for their part in the

operation.

Because of technical difficulties in recording the first

part of this meeting with NOSaNKO, it is not possible to

account of his initial statement on this

what NOSENKO said at this time has seen pieced to-

gether from remarks he made later in the meeting, from

recorded recapitulations of his statements by his case

officer later during the meeting and from notes taken at

the meeting.

In speaking of IONOV's assignment

of KGB "flaps and seals" specialists

to France, NOSENKO apparently was not referring to the JOHN-

SON case; NOSENKO said he first heard about the case after

returning from Geneva in 1962, and JOHNSON stated firmly that

Paris to instruct the Legal Residency case officer on the technical

aspects of the eniry but also was involved in photographing the

NOSEiKO tOld CIA on 28 January 1954 that he had learned

of this operation, shortly after returning to Moscow from Geneva

in 1962.. from a friend in the KGS,

one of several technicians who

participäred in the operation.

NOSENKO thought the source of this

information was either LEEEDEV Or FOFANOV.

During intensive debriefing on 6 April 1964 NOSEIKO stated:

"I first reard arout this from KARSTHIK)V." After describing the

functions of the Special Section in Moscow, he went on to say that

What did KARETNIKOV say when you first heard about

this?

NOSENKO:

That they had carried out operations several times in

Paris, that two had already been there for this pur-

pose, that they went there as diplomatic couriers to

Paris...

(NOSENKO at this point repeated KARETNIKOV' S

description of the role of the Special Section tech-

nicians in advising the Paris-based KGB case officer

and the methods which were used to gain initial access

to the vault.)

NOSENKO:

KARETNIKOV was the first and then LEBEDEV. LEBEDEV

'I haven't seen you in a long time, what have you boen doing?"

And he would say: 'Oh, I have just

been to Paris on a trip.' Or

maybe I asked KARENIKOV where LEBEDEV was because I hadn't seen

him in a long time, and he told me that LIPEDEY was away on a

trip."

When asked on 29 July 1964 which officers had ever mentioned

this case to him, in any way at any rine, NoSeiKo replied! "KARET

NIKOV, LEBEDEV, and IONOV in Moscow and FOFANOV in Paris in Janu

ary 1964."

He affirmed that he had never discussed the

casE with,

or mentioned 1t to, anyone else.

"Yeg," he continued, "I think

LEBEDEV was the first one to speak to me about this cese, because

in 1962 I was Deput! Chief of the Seventh Department and was super-

vising the work of the Third Section on hotels and restaurants.*

LEBEDEV was a member of a commission which had been set up in the

KGB to plan for the operational exploitation of new hotels which

were being built or planned.

He was coming to see me about these

So while I might hear juse a little bit about this from

IONOV, I would hear more

from LEBEDEV, because he was & good friend

and was coming to my office on business."

The following is from the protocol which NOSENKO aigned on

18 February 1965:

"I first learned of the penetration of an American

installation in Paris after my return to Moscow in June 1962

and at e time that I was a conscious and willing coliaborator

of the CIA

and was attempting to gather information of inter-

est to Americar Intelligence.

I irmediately recogrized the

of this information to American Intelligence when

I first heard it.

"I learned of this case in small pieces, in several

conversations (some in my KGB office and possibly others.

elsewhere) with several different officers of the KGB over

a period of several months.

These officers were KARETNIKOV,

IONOV, and LEBEDEV, all members of the Special Technical

Section of the Second Chief Directorate.

"I do not remember from which of these three officers

I first heard of the case, which of these officers told me

what portions of the story, or when-I learned the individ

ual details of this case which I have reported to CIA, or

the season of the year in which I learned them.

"I do not know why these officers told me of the

Paris case,

except that we were in good relations.

will tell other KGB officers some details of operations on

largely on ACSI réports to the

His first attempt to defect was aborted in February

1952 when Hedwig admitted to JOHNSCS at the last minute that she

had lied to him when she had informed him earlier that she had

their defection as he had requested.

and

at the same time to

that time, but he continued to work for Soviet Intelligence until

• During an intervier on 18 February 1955,

JOHNSO! stated

that he did not feel that his espionage efforts at Camp Des Loges

had been very profitable for the Soviets.

It was his opinion that

he had access during this

period was the top secret one on Seventh Army plans for retreat

to the Pyrences in the event of a soviet Army attack.

proposed that he attempt to obtain it for the

Soviets, however,

ViASOV showed a complete lack of interest.

VLASOV's attitude led

JOHNSON to believe that the Soviets already had the document.

JOHNSON stated further that it was his usual practice to scan:

documents which came into his possession and to make oral and

sometimes written reports to the Soviets on their general contents.

He specifically recalled discussing with: VLASOV the periodic

counterintelligence summaries issued by CIC to which he had access,

but VLASOV had not seemed interested in them.

these discussions came up in connection with possible use of the

"roll-over" camera, and that VLASOV's response had been that the

information involved was not worth the risk of his exposure.*

JOHNSON recalled that "at their last neeting ard for a few

meetings prior thereto, he and

'Felix' (VLASOV) did no: stop at

was conaucted as they walked in the area of their point of con-

assured, was completely out or character on this occasion.

At

'Felix' about the status of

'Felix' did

not appear to be interested in anything he had to say, Finally,

* JOHNSON said that in the Classified Control Section he had

access to all classified documents originating with Seine

Area Command and to some classified documents originating

in other headquarters; he was responsible for supervising

the printing of classified documents and for accounting.for

and distributing all

authorized copies of these documents.

JOHNSON was asked on 18 February 1965 whether it would have

been possible for him to take original documents or copies

of them to his Soviet handlers.

He replied that he could

have forged receipts and taken

a document fron the Center

on his person and, in addition, he could have made extra

copies of any classified document. • He did not do this

cause he had an interest in seeing

(JOHNSON) raised the questior. of how. he was to rotify 'Felix' in

and the letter 'X' if he received orders for assigment elsewhere."

At this meeting VLASOV also told JOHNSON that he was rot to

worry if contact was not established

immediately upon his return

to Washington.

He then gave JOHNSON contact instructions which

called for the first meeting to take place in New York City in

eight months later.

This was the first time that all three had met to-

gether since UPZHUMOV had turned him over to VLASOV in 1961, prlor

to the Orly penetrations.

For URZHUMOV's benefit, VLASOV again

reviewed the arrangements for reestablishing cor-act in December,

which gave JOHNSON an opportunity to express concern that he was

to be out of contact for such a long time and to suggest the

desirability of some sort of emergency contact arrangements such

as he had had during his duty tour

and URZHUMOV

told JOHNSON that such arrangements

would not be necessary.*

JOISON claimed to have had no contact with the Soviets

during his assignment

at the Pentagon Courier Transfer Station

from May 1964 until he went ArOL in October of that year.

According to MINTKENBAUGH, when JOHNSON contacted him in

Arlington after his return to the United States, JOHNSON

said that when he was leaving Paris the Soviets. treated him

as though he was being

"aropped."

JOHNSON said he had been

instructed to get rid of all materials used in the operation

before leaving France.

He also told MINTKENBAUGH that an-

other reason for this belief was the fact that he had asked

for instructions regarding emergency meeting procedures but

had been told by the Soviets that none were needed.

KENBAUGH remarked to the FBI that this was a change in

usual procedures.

She wag told to return to Karlshorst the same evening with

At this firat meeting, the JOHNSONs were questioned by

a group of about seven Soviets concerning JOHNSON's desire

to cooperate against the United States and his motivations

for wishing to do so.

JOHNSON gave the Soviets no classified

about using him.

On four of

five occasions prior to JOHNSON's transfer to the

United States in 1954, she crossed

the border carrying f1lm

According

to hire. JOHNSON,

she never knew what was on the film and

received no money other

JOHNSON married her; as promised, in April 1953.

his

activities with her

she often accompanted

JOHNSON to operational meetings after his return to France

in 1959 and until her deteriorating mental condition made

this inadvisable in November 1960.

(She still went with

JOHNSON to the vicinity of the meetings and waited for him.)

Her knowledge of his activities thus was practically total.

JOHNSON, for example, gave her full details of the Orly Pere-

tration, including descriptions of the methods used to achieve

initial

entry, how he selected documents for the Soviets,

and the procedures used to pass the documents to his case

occasion and returned home shortly before Christnas 1960.

Following her release from the hospital, Ars. JOHNSON was

unable to sleep,

and as the local doctor would not prescribe

more than two sleeping pills a werk, JOHNSoN took her to

Vienna in January 1961.

After she had been exanined, JOHN

SON was told that she would have to remain in a private hospi

tal there for an indefinite period of tine for nedication.

the hospital doctors

advised him to have Mi's.

She returned twice to Vienna for shock treatment and

examinations while JOHNSON remained in France.

When JOHN-

SON travelled to Vienna to get Mrs. JOHNSON after the second

of these visits in the fall of 1962, her doctor told him that

she had referred to him (JOINSON) as a "Russian general"

and had accused one of the nurses of

being a Soviet spy.

(Earlier, in the presence of neighbors, JOHNSON was accused

by his wife of being a spy.)

JOHNSON learned from his

father-in-law that Mes. JOHNSON had also told him that JOHN.

SON was a Russian general®

Eventually Mrs. JOHNSON was

persuaded to connit herself to a U.S. Army hospital, and at

the end of April 1964 she was evacuated from France

to Walter

Reed lospital in Washington.

(JOHNSOY and his children

returned to the Unlied States several days later.) She was

released shortly afterward, but her erratic behavior, JON-

SON said, prompted his disappearance in October 1961.

The FBI report of this debriefing of JOHNSON states

(e) Soviet Concern About Mirs. JOHNSON's Illness

When it became apparent that his wife's treatment in

Vienna had been unsuccessful and that he would have

leave Orleans to find a more suitable environment for her,

JOHNSON discussed the matter. in detail with his KGB case

officer.

In the fall of 1962, after he made photograpas

of the vault dour for URCHUMOY, 'the Minox camera was re-

turned to the Husslans.

This (according to JOHNSON)

was

done

because of Soviet concern over Hedy's mental condition.

JOHNSON

was instructed to retain no incriminating naterials

in his possession."

After URZHUNOV learned of Mrs. JOHNSON'S

confinement in a U.s. military hospital,

JOHNSON said he

became

"all shook up" about the possibility that she might

talk.

URZHUMOV told JOHNSON to inform his

wife that he was

"except that

Soviet fear that Mrs. JOHNSON might talk also was re-

flected in the handling of WINTKENBAUGH in lashington.

KENBAUGH explained to the FBI that "during the period

both the type, and in some cases,

the specific docu

ments, which were in the Orty

vault at some time during

the poriod November 1962 to May 1963.

But it has not

been possible to identify precisely which documents

were in the vault on the dates of the penetrations....

The only viable assumption...is that all the documents

to which JOHNSON had physical access during the period

of his vault penetrations, i.c., all the documents in

the vault, were subjected to possible compromise by

the Soviets.... The review, which is continuing,

volvos a considerable volume of documents which may

total more than a thousand.

"The full extent of damage will only be known

review of their documents to date, indicate that as a

result of access to documents in the Orly vault, the

Soviets may bave learned:

Plan (SIOP) including

the attack plans of

the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the identity of Soviet

targets, the tactical plans of USAF elements in-

cluding weapons systems and methods of delivery.

*Compilation of the final damage assessment has been compli-

cated by three factors. One was the difficulty involved in

determining what specific documents may have passed through

the Orly Courier Transfer Station during his

assignment there.

Second, since all documents remained

wrapped while at the

station,

JOHNSON himself has been

of little assistance in

identifying them, although he has said that he concentrated:

his selection on documents addressed to particular commands.

Firally, Armed Forces courier service records for this period

have been destroyed.

4. Unsuccessful Approaches to L.S. Citizens*

After providing the two promised leads** at his first

that the KGB in 1958 or 1959 had

made an unsuccessful. re

cruitment approach to Richard C. HARUSTONE,

Inttially NOSENKO said that

the KGB had photographs of MARYSTONE in homosexual as well

as heterosexual

acts, but in 1964 he stated that although

the KGB knew HARMSTONE to be a homosexual, it had no photo-

graphs of hin in such activities.

The KGB,

thanks to micro-

phones in the limbassy, learned that HARUSTONE did aot tell

U.S.

authorities the full story of the approach, omitting

sexuality.

(11) Information from NOSENKO

On 9 June 1962, at his first meeting with CIA in Geneva,

NOSENKO said at the outset that he would sell two itens

information in return for the money he needed, and that he

would tell CIA no more. After he had-finished describing

the "ANDREY" case, however, he volunteered a story about

HARUSTONE, a Second

or Third Secretary at the American E-

bassy in boscow.

The KGB tried to recruit him, but he re-

fused the approach.

Previously the KGB tad used both female

and male agerts against him, and the KCB had photographs of

the homosexual side

as his activitles with girls.

NOSENKO believed that HARUSTONE did not tell the whole story

to ine U.S. officials, reporting only that there had been

operations against Richard HARMSTONE.

Part of the plan,

(He thought that

HARMSTONE had left the Soviet Union rot long after the ap-

proach was made, toward the end of lis tour,

and it was not

an early departure.)

The KCB also knew HARMSTONE to be a

homosexual, but did not have ans pictures of him in this kind

0f activity; the KGB did have, however, a serles of nude

In 1964 NOSENKO denied that he had had eny personal

U,S. Enbassy Section at the time, working on correspondents, *

he would not have taken part in so important an operation,

He said that he had heard about the operation from V.d.

He had a dog:

in an apartment in the city or i country house outside Yoscow.

His Russian maid or cleaning women

The KGB

thought he would not be recruitable by ordinary blackmail on

the basis of his intimate relations with his naid, so the maid,

a KGB agent, was lostructed to confess to him that she had

when the KGB complained, he provided a mixture of truth and

disinformation.

GOLTSYN said this case study was based on

he was not sure if the operation really did result in a suc

The BINDER Case

Information frOn NOSENKO

While reviewing notes he had brought to a meeting in

Geneva on 26 January 1964,

NOSEYKO first mentioned the

unsuccessiul attempt to recruit Peter BINDER.

JOSENKO said

that BINDER, the

"top Sergeant in charge of merica House,"

room at the America House for some time

recruitment approach consequently failed.

In later Interviers by CIA and the FBI, NOSE KO Identi

fied the woman involved as Galya NOSELLI, a KOB agent e-

ployed at America liouse as a dishwasher.

NOSENKO said that

Vladieir DESKIN of the U.S. Embassy Section was the case of

ficer working against BINDER,

and that S.M. FEDOSEYEV, Chief

of the American Department, took part in

This

was 1r 1962, NOSEYKO

aiter he had transferred to the

•Icurist department, ind for this reason he could provide

no further details on the case.

(11) Information from BINDER

Master Sergeant Peter BINDER arrived in Moscow, where

ne was assigned as manager of America House,

on 16 March 1961.*

He was approached by the KGB on 15 January 1963 and reported

the KGB citeapt to loS. Enbassy officials the same day.

22 January 1963 BINDER

was withdrawn from Moscow before the

completion of his tour.

At the airport as he was leavirg,

the Soviets attempted to prevent his departure by saying

that he had rever beer properly accredited to the USSR.

The plane was delajed for about 15 minutes while a heated

exchange took place between Soviet officials and tho American

officers accompanying BINDER•

He then was allowed to leave.

The following

description of the Soviet recruitment attempt

is drawn fron devrieflogs of BINDER by the U.S. Embassy

curity Officer in Moscow on the day of the incident and

debrlefings by the FBI and Department of the Army after his

return to the United States.

In about December 1961, according to BINDER, he first

became intinate with MORELLI, a dishwasher at America House

whom he has described as being a pretty, intelligent, well-

Their relationship

continued

until June or July 1962, at which time MORELLI "disappeared"

from her Job without notice while BINDER was on leave. During

that she was going to her hotel to get her

passport, which would prove her nationality,

peared and was not seen again at America House. NOSENKO ro

of another military code clerk (see Part. V.E.3.c.).

their affalr,

BINDER occasionally gave MORELLI glfts of

money and clothing but restricted his mee isgs with her to

his room in the dormitorg.

In about February or Jarch 1902

MORELLI Same to BINDER and said that she thought she was

pregnant; she sade no dezands of BINDER, horever,. and said

nothing about getting an abortion.:. Although at his first

Interview in Moscow DINUER said that MORELLI at no time 1a-.

dicated that she was required to obtain information for the

Soviets, he told the FBI: in late February 1963 that on 030

occasion

in big rcom at Aserica House MORELLI admitted to him

that she was sent to America House by the Soviets and thet

all employees there were required to meet in two groups once

a month with their contacts (KGB officers] to discuss the

America House personnel.

On the morning

of 15 January 1963,

the day of the ap-

proach,

at a soviet barbershop, some 300 yards awsy.

While he was

enroute, a car pulled up beside him, three

"goons" strong-

arned him into the back seat, and he was driven to a nearby

Militia station.

some perfunctory questioning, one -

of the Militianen made

several phone calls, and an interro

gator arrived a few minutes later.

The interrogator had a letter which he said had been

mailed by MORELLI to the l.S. Embassy and had been inter-

cepted by the KGB.

The letter contained numerous allegations

against BINDER,

which the interrogator proceeded to list.

Among them, PINDER was able to recall the following:

On 25 November 1961 there was a party at America

Muuse for soviet enployees,

a?ter which BINDER and

MORELLI Went to BISDER'S

Subsequently BINDER

and MORELLI lived together as man and wife.

•At another party,

in December 1961, BINDER

pointed out five enlisted men living in America House

the letter named them telling MORELLI that they were

informants for John f. ABIDIAY, the Embassy Security

Officer.*

He told MORELLI that the girls working in

America House should be particularly careful of Charles

GIDARO, as he was ABIDIAN's right-hand Dan.

-In February 2962, MORELLI told BINDER that she was

pregnant, and BINDER instructed her to get an abortion.

-At the George Washington's Birthday Party in 1962

BINDER pointed out ABIDIAN to MORELLI and Svetlana

IVANOVA, another employee of Anerica House, and told them

to be careful of hin as he was the Embassy Security Offi

—At some point BINDER gave a sewing machine to &

Soviet citizen to sell for him

it another time BINDER

ordered from the United States' a coat for the America

House employee Luba TISHKINO, but then told her that 1t

had been lost in the nail.

The coat was not really lost,

however; BINDER gave it to one of the old cooks at Ameri

c& House because she paid him money for it.

See Part V.I.J.d. concersing NOSENKO's responsibilities for

the KGB coverage of ABIDILY.

NOSENKO has not reported that

the KCR was aware of these enlisted men serving as Informants

for ABIDIAN.

•After asking whether BINDER was acqualnted with

H5. LOHRER of the hest Cerman isbassy, the interrogator

asked if BINDER hid given LOHNSR goods to sell on the

Soviet market.

-In April 1962, BINDER told MORELLI that Hugh

NCTCOVERY had arrived at the U.S. Embassy as Security

Oficer, that HONTCOWZRY was & good friend of his, and

that be had told NONTGOMERY about his aflair with

Richard C. JACOB,* a U.S. Embassy employee, was a "well-

trained spy" and thai MORELLI and IVAYOVA should there-

fore be carsful of hir.

In describing his conversation at the Militia station,

BINDER said

that, after

the interrogator had asked'a number

of questions, he, BINDER, cosplaired that the Soviet was

talking too fast.

An interpreter was thereupon called in

and remained until BINDER as questioned concerning JACOB.

At this point: the interpreter left and tha interrogator

continued to question BINDER on persosal matters.

all questioning was in Russian, which BINDER gererally under-

After discussing BINDER's fasily, the interrogator

BINDER what vught to be done about

the letter and the

charges it contained.

He suggested that if the letter fero

to the American Anbassador, io whom it was addressed,

U.So officials would not belive BISDER's denials of the

charges: tis career in the Army would be ruined, and BINDER

muld no longer be able to support his two daughters.

According

to BINDER, his reply was that there was nothing

1f the Soviets

decided to forward the letter, and "that would

be that."

The interrogator then left the room.

When he returned about 15 minutes later he spoke to

BINDER in a frierdly manner, commenting that BINDER had been

in Moscow for almost two years and that it was obviously

Importart for him to finish his tour there and remain in the

BINDER agreed with this.

The interrogator then said

BINDER's actions while in the Soviet Union had been quite

that he had always been very fair to the Soviet girls

who worked for hin, and that he, the interrogator, had decided

to help bin.

The Soviet continued that he was going to forget

about the letter and all the charges contained in it and that

the letser would not be forwarded.

He also pointed out that

as the ictter was not going anywhere, shore fas no need for

BINDER to mention the ircident of his arrest to anyone. BIN-

DER was then driven back to the barber shop.

BINDER summed up the entire ircident, which lasted a

Iittle over two hours,

by saying that the approsch was very

low key and that at no time was he specifically asked to sup

ply intoration to the Sovlets, although this was implicit in the

remarke of his interviewers.

During questioning by U.S. authoritieg afterwards,

BINDER said that he had denied the truth of the allegations,

point-by-point, and that, apart from the charge that he was

Intimate with NORELLI, none of them, in fact, were true.

Specifically, BINDER told Army questioners in June 1963 that

he had laughed at his interrogator when the latter attributed

to him the iove statements concerning LONGOMERY and JACOB

Operations Involving Other Westerners

a. Tabulation

(1) Introduction

NOSENKO has provided identifying information on 90 YGB agents,

probable agente, and operational contacts of western (but non-

American) Citizenship and he has described an additional 12 de-

velopment and investigation operations against

such third-country

nationals.

As indicated in

the folloring tabulation, 55 of

NOSENKO's recruitmert leads and five of the 12 Investigative

and developmental leads were contained in the notes which he

brought to the mee-irgs with CIA in Geneva in 1964 and

which

en

abled him to provide

specific information on these individuals,

for exampie, their dates of birth and precise dates of recruit-

ment.

At the same time,

however; NOSENKO generally furrished

comparatively fever details concerning the KGB

operations against

other Westerners than he did in his leads to American cases;

often his information did not exceed that written in the notes.

He has disclaimed personal participation in all but four of his

recruitment leads

and tro

of his investigation/developrent cases.

For the most part NOSENKO's foreign leads are based upor informa-

tion which he said he learned casually and noted for passage to

The VASSALL Case

Information from NOSEiKO

At the 11 June 1962 meeting with CIA, NOSENKO first mention

ed the lead which was later equated with William J.C. VASSALL, the

KGB agent in the British idmiralty.

Neither then nor later in

1962 did NOSENKO identify this agent by name.

NOSENKO was asked on 11 June 1962 whether he had ever heard

9f the KGS agent George BLAKE, "the

man who compromised the famous

tunnel operation in Berlin."*

NOSENKO replied:

"Yes, I did.

I'll tell you this, that there was a far more importart Englishmi

our agent than BLAKE.** He is a very big man,

and fron him

We get all the details about NATO.

He is our number one agent, the best of all intelligence informa-

tion. He had seen in Moscow, and we recruited him there.

him on a homosexiality charge, a very extreme ore involving multi-

ple persons.

The case oficers who recruited him received the

Order of Lenin..•

He is not an intelligence man.

He is a high-

ranking mar.

He is working on all kinds of NiTO matters and is

delivering mose valuable information...

He was in Moscow some

time ago.

My friend and three others in the KGB section running

him received the Order of Lenin.

That is a very high distinction

for the KG3...

I do not know the man's name, cut I do know when

he was in Moscow, and I know that he has a very high position.

He is in London now." NOSENKO was reluctant to go into further

details at this, his second meeting with CIA, but he added: "I'll

tell you all about him tomorrow, my brothers.

I will tell you

many things tomorrow, and the day after...

This is our number

one operation. There is no sum of money we would not be willing

to pay him."

The next day NOSENKO was asked for additional information

about the

"high level British agent,"

and he told his case offi-

"I don't know the exact content of the material the was

and I know that he even brought in draft copies when he was here

them extremely valuable material.

He is either a deputy or a

First Secretary, or a member of the secretariat: the most im-

portant thing being that all material of the greatest signifi-

cant value passes through his hands.

He was recruited in 1956

I don't know when he returned to London, but he was

working with the (KGB Legal) Pesident there, who was at that

time a man whose name is Major General (N.B.) RODIN.*** RODIN

BLAKE, a British MI-6 officer, has admitted that he informed

the KGB of the Berlin tunnel operation (which involved the

intercept of Soviet and East. German telephone conversations

prior to the time the operation became

active in May 1955: it was terminated in April 1956®

NOSENKO told :CIA on 13 June 1962 that the "high-level

British agent" had on one occasion provided a report on an Anglo-

American conference in Loncon, which contained referençes to

American and British Intelligence operations.*

meeting in 1962, a day later, NOSENKO again stated that RODIN

had received the Order of Lenin for his part in the operation.

When asked whether the name KOROVIN meant anything to him in

connection with operations against the British, he replied: "I

heard that name.

but I cannot associate it in any way.

Possibly he is the man in London now. "**

After recontacting CIA in 1964, NOSENKO reported that he

had alreary provided almost all he knew about VASSALL, who had

been arrested in 1962.

VASSALL, NOSENKO summarized, was re-

cruited in Moscow and turned over copies of official Embassy

documents while there. After he returned to England and while

he was working in the Admiralty, he was considered to be the

KGB's best agent.

His value, NOSENKO said, was indicated by

the fact that CHURANOV had received a KGB award for his role

in the recruitment and then later, when VASSALL was producing

in England, the Order of Lenin along with RODIN, the handling

officer in London.***

NOSENKO on 1 February 1964 said: "In general it was known

from some source important information was coming in from

the British, specifically,

information about NATO,

as the NATO Intelligence Services would hold a meeting in

London, we had the information as to what was discussed.

When the American, Canadian, and British groups met in

London. The material came in from that VASSALL,

someone else--I don't know." On 8 September 1964 NOSENKO

commented further that in 1960 or 1961, about the same time

he heard about these materials, he also learned that the

KGB First Chief Directorate had a good source in British

counterintelligence.

NOsENKo said that he did not know

whether VASSALL had

access to this type of information or

whether this indicated another source.

** NOSENKO was asked on 29 January 1964 whether RODIN, VASSALL'S

handler in London, was also known as KOROVIN. He replied he

thought so.

***Questioned on CHURAVOV's reaction to VASso'd sast: moell,

reason.

suspicion were allayed when he learned from CHURANOV

soine tire

later that the First Chief Directorate had reluctantly decidsd

that GLITSIN must have been

source to the VAsSALL lead. The

leaders of the First Gief Directorate did not want to believe

at first that COLITSYN was the source of the lead, but it was

known that although GOLITSYN did not know VASSALI's rame, he had

on one or two occasions translated materials received from

VASSALL.

(11) Information from GOITSYN

On 26 March 1962 GOLITSIN was being interviewed by British

authorities and provided information leading to the identifica-

tion of VASSALL as a KGB agent.

GOLITSY.: said that he worked

in the International Treaty

GOLITSYN said on 25 May 1962 that the photographic repro

which, wher developed, revealed 140 photographs of pages from 17

official hamiralty documents dated betweer. 24 July ard 3 September

1962; all were reported to be secret documents,

which would gravely damage the security of the state.") In his

confession,

VASSALL described his recruitment oy CHURANOV, and

another man, known only as "fikolay" ir. March 1955 or the basis

of compromising photographs taken during the course of a "homo

sexual orgy" involving himself and a rumker of Soviets. at the

Berlin Hotel in Moscow at the end of October 1954.

September 1955 on until he returned to England, VASSALL bought

KGS silence by bringing CHURiNOV and "Nikolay" documents from

the British Embassy.

In May 1956, in anticipation of his depar-

eure for home, VessAlt was introduced to a third sovier, subse

quently identified as RODIN/KOROVIN, who was to become his con

tact in Lordon.

Their first meeting in England took place about

the end of August 1956.

VASSALL continued to meet RODI! once

every three weeks until the arrest of Soviet Illegal Gordon LONS-

DALE in January 1961, which resu'ed in a four morth moratorium

on personal meetings.

To these meetings VASSALL would bring docu-

ments that he obtained from his office

in the Naval Intelligence

Division of the Admiralty; the ducuments would be photographed

and returned to VASSALL durirg the sane meeting.

Several months after RODIN had broken off contact as a re-

sult of the LONSDALl: arrest, VASSALL was contacted by N.P. KAR-

PEKOV**and there were

infrequent meetings from then

until May

19620

It was not until May 1962, however, that VASSALL was told

to resume his espionage collecion; he was trained to operate an

Exakta camera and used it thereafter until his arrest.

The last

two meetings with KARPEKOV took place on 13 and 17 August 1962.

At the meeting on 13 August, KARPEKOV told VASSALL that he was

going away on holiday and the further meeting four days later

was arranged so that VASSALL could hand over anything he had

obtained before KARPEKOV left. At their final meeting, KARPEKOV

arranged for their next meeting to take place on 30 October 1962.

(KARPEKOV left London for the Soviet Union on 6 September 1962.)

By VASSALL's account, the first time he received any money

from the Soviets was just before Christmas 1955, when he was

cer by

KGB double agent Boris BELITSKIY (see Part VI,D.6.) in

April 1960, before KARPEKOV was handling VASSALL. RODIN was

6. The BELITSKIY Operation

a. Introduction

When NOSZKO first contacted CIA in June 1952, one of the

two. pieces of information which he said he was willirg to sell

was the fact that the CIA

agent BELIISKIY was under KCB control.

(8.Xe. BELITSKIY, a Radio Moscow broadcaster and Soviet Govern

ment interpreter,

had been a CIA agent in place since his recruit

ment

at the brussels Exposition in Septenber 1953.)

At the time

NOSENKO made his information known, ELLITSKIY had met ClA repre-

sentatives in the West

in debriefing sessions on three separate

occasions.

The last occurred in Geneva in May 1962 while BELIT-

• SKIY was serving as an interpreter for a nio Conference.

time NOSENKO was also in Gereva, participating in the Disarmament

Conference.

b. Information from NOSENKO

(i) Statements zn 1962

In the discussions with CIA officers on 9 and 11 June 1962,

NOSENKO revealed considerable information on BELITSKIY.

He also

described his own connection with the case and offered his opinion

on how CIA should proseed in the light of his revelations.

He

claimed that he had first heard of the RELITSKIY case, by its

code name "BELKIN, " when he was working in the U.S. Embassy Sectio..

American Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate.

Not directly

involved with the agent, he lcarred of the case through his friend-

ship with the chief of the section (name not given) which was chen

runnirg him.*

NOSENKO,

He did not accively participate in the case, however,

until the spring

of 1962.

During his tour with the Disarmament

Conference, NOSENKO said, he received a cable fron Moscow direct-

ing him to give advice to the "young" and "inexperienced" case

officer, V.L. ARTEMYEV in thé event that American Intelligence

should contact BELITSKIY in Geneva.

Actually, NOSENKO continued,

the Second Chief Directorate had

"inserted" BELITSKIY into the

WHO delegation in the hope that CIA would "find him."

There was

such a contact, NOSENKO said, and therefore he knew about the

handling of the case insofar

as the Geneva meetings were cor

cerned, although he had not been personally involved in it be-

fore.

NOSENKO described BELITSKIY as a KGB agent whom the Americans

had recruited in London and never met inside the Soviet Union.

NOSENKO stressed both of these points a number of times:

knew that in due course he was recruited in London..

There was

never any contact with him inside."

NOSENKO stated that BELIT-

SKIY was an agent of the American Department in 1962, although

he. had once worked for the Second (British) Department. He

NOSENKO said that at that time he himself was Deputy Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section. It follows from this that he would

have become aware of the BELITSKIY case between January 1960

and January 1962,

In 1964 NOSENKO identified the friend who

had told him about BELITSKIY as V.I. PETROV, Chief of the

Second Section, American Department, responsible for pene

trating American Intelligence operations, mainly those in

the UssR.

claimed not to know the date of recruitment but seid that he

knew that the case was already in progress during his second

assignment with the U.S. Embassy Section (anuary 1969-January

1962), and "The first time he went abroad he was already our

agent. He had been our agent for a long,

NOSENKO indicated that the KGB's purpose in furning the

BELITSKIY operation was to lure American Intelligence into meet-

Although BELITSKIY, ir meeting with his An-

erican case officers, contirually pleaded fear of contacting or

being contacted by mexican Intelligence in Moscow, NOSENKO

claimed that this was a ruse and that the real KGB

intent was to

use BELITSKIY "to aran you to us - to the Soviet Union - so that

you would work with him rot abroad."

important, that they mail the letter

NOSINKO also advised CIA to do

something acout the safe apartment in which "Bob" and "Henry"

had met BELITSKIY.

He complained that BELITSKIY had noted that

the name on the door was not that of the American Counsellor

When he came to the West again in 1964, NOSENKO again dis

cussed the BELITSKIY case.*

In January 1964, he was asked his

advice about CIA's handling BELITSKIY.

Again he suggested that

This operation, like

all "games" of the Second Section, was supervised by M.G. MATVEYEV,

Deputy Chief of the American Department..

In 1964 NOSENKO made a number of comments and observations

c. Information from Other Sources

BELITSKI? was a chemist by training and a translator and

radio commentator by profession.

At the time of his recruit

ment, and throughout his relationship with CIA, he was employed

by Radio Moscod.

Fluent in English, he was used primarily as

a scientific commentator on programs beamed to the British Isles.

In addition to his radio work, BELITSKIY frequently served as an

interpreter for the Soviet Government, both at home and abroad,

and achieved considerable recognition

in this capacity during

such widely publicized events as the POWERS trial

and GAGARIN'S

visit to England.

Ostersibly he was fully trusted by the Soviet

authorities and was allowed

an unusual degree of freedom in his

association with foreigers.

1958 while he was serving as an interpreter

In August MI-6 gave CIA its view:

BELITSKIY had come to London with a Soviet intelligence brief:

his attempts to contact Nesterners were so blatant that the KGB

must have known about them; but it was possible that not all of

the agent's activities were necessarily controlled by the KGB.

In September 1960 CiA advised MI-6 of its agreement that BELIT-

"undoubtedly had an RIS mission when he came to the Uk

earlier this year," adding the opinion that he probably had

been used in the past by the KGB; also, that the only way to

resolve the unexplained points, CIA stated, was to engage in a

secure interrogation which would include a polygraph examina-

As of October 1960 the CIA position on the case was

stated as tollows:

"As matters now stand we have our doubts

during two of these BELITSKIY was given a polygraph test.

He

was questioned closely (albeit in a friendly manner) about his

relationship with the kob.

He explained that he bas frequertly

in contact with persons whom he suspected to be kob, both

his work at Radio Moscow and particularly in connection with his

travels abrcad,

but that his only official briefing by the KGB

was in connection with the Porles trial.

On another oscasion.

he said, he was told how to handle himself if the wrong" ques-

tions were asked

at the MARTIN/MITcHeLL press conference in

MOScOW,

but this was not openly a kGs briefing.

BELITSKIY also

indicated that all travellers leaving the USSR were routinely

interviewed and briefed, and were told to

"sort of keep their

eyes open" to locate potential targets of information.

He said

he felt

that "whatever he had been

able to do along this line"

had resulted in his being given DY's abroad and having relative

freedom of movement.

At the end of the london debriefings it was concluded by

MI-6

and CIA that BELITSKIY "did not appear to be practicing

deception or to be

controiled by the RIS."

Both did agree, how-

ever, that he was "evasive when pressed, then glit, but without

volunteering information.'*

The majority view at that time was

that the agent's prime motivation. was a financial one, coupled

with an assurance of CIA assistance upon his defection.

It was

also believed that BELITSKIY had by then

become so deeply in-

volved with CIA that it would be very difficult for him to break

The third contact with BELITSKIY was made in Geneva in May

of 1962.

The CIA case

officer met the agent six times.

for a

total of approximately 12 hours.

At this series of debriefings

a second American case officer was irtroduced.

In his report on

the contact

the original case officer stated that he felt

"stronger than ever that

Subject's potential as an agent is

unlimited."

He stated that his original views on BELITSKIY'S

bona fides had not changed and that he felt the latter realized

that he had passed the point when he could afford to report his

collaboration with CIA to the KGB.

The second

case officer

reported that the reservations which he had had about the agent's

bona fides before the meetings with him had been dispelled by

the latter's manner.

He also reported, however, that on two

occasions during the meetings he had had a "sinking feeling"

that "the relationship was not kosher."

He said that during

the discussion of the two factions which BELITSKIY claimed

were then vying with each other in the Soviet Union (the

"moderates"

vs. the "hard-liners"), he had the feeling "that

the tale was concocted and maybe the agent was trying to convey

Throughout the course of this operation various individuals

participating in it expressed doubts about BELITSKIY's bona

Eldes.

Whatever doubts may have existed, however, they did

not affect the conduct of the case: the general consensus was

that the agent was not controlled

by the KGB, and the case

continued to be run as if he were

not.

Moreover, the poly-

graph examiner reported that BELITSKIY had been

"substan

tially truthful in his answers to the questions asked," al-

though he did recommend that the agent be re-examined under

controlled conditions.

to U.S. authorities sotething

that someone warted to have convey-

ed and could rot have done through normal charnels."

The second

case officer was also struck by a change which he perceived in

BELITSKIY's manner when they were discussing the matter of con

tact inside the Soviet Union: At first,

BELITSKIY was very con-

cerned, but toward the end of the meeting he seemed to abandon

all caution and to be quite happy about it, even suggesting that

a CIA courier could perhaps bring him some scarce goods.

Throughout the relationship, however, BELITSKIY exhibited

great concern for his personal safety.

During the period between

the initial and the second series of meetings. CIA sent him two

open letters containing secret writing.

He responded to the first

(in time to validate the terms of the contract), but not to the

second, explaining in a later meeting that his failure to do so

had been due to fear for his own safety,

His reasons for this

fear (including the fact that the handwriting on the open

letter

"typically Anerican"'), were juaged plausible and convincing,

and his desire to discontinue this type of communication was

and completely unwitting of the true nature of

his relationship with CIA.

He insisted, moreover,

on a guaran-

tee that if CIA ever did have to communicate with him by any

means, it should never refer to the subject of a previous

conversation.

He felt that under such circumstances he would

since there

would be no evidence that he had responded to the overtures of

American Intelligence.

BELITSKIY also expressed concern on sev-

eral occasions for the case officers' welfare as it related to

his own, cautioning them, for instance, never to go to Berlin

or to Moscow.

BELITSKIY was deemed from the first to have access through

his work to infornation of unusual value to the United States

science-related events.

In addition,

it was hoped that through

friends, or acquaintances, he would be able

to provide some

information on certain

other

high-priority re-

quirements.

During each

of the series of debriefings he was

able to furnish some general information on Soviet political

factions and currents, on many scientific and governmental

personalities, and on

missile and space-related events.

information was in general, however, either not of great value,

already known, or impossible to evaluate or corroborate. Never-

theless, the

case officer felt that the agent had "no way of

measuring the usefulness of any particular piece of informa-

tion" and that he was "going out of his way to provide us with

everything he thought might be of possible use."

BELITSKIY was not able to answer specific requirements

in the highest priority fields of missiles and atomic energy.

However, as he himself stressed, he did not have direct access

to classified documents,

and CIA had not expected that he

would be successful in

these areas.

On the other hand. he

did appear to have access to some nilitary information of a

classified nature through his status in the military reserves.

- GOLITSY named a KGS officer who had been

stationed in Vienna where he was working on

lagoslay

targets; this officer was aware of POPOV's association

with

the Austrian woman (see above), suspected POPCV,

and although re reported his suspicions,

nothing was done

about them.

All of this occurred while POPOV was

serving

in Austria (until September 1955).

Some time in 1957 or

1958, GOLITSY, continued, the Kos was told by a source that

POPOV was an agent.

The

KGB then assigned this KGB officer

to Germany because

he. knew POPOV and was familiar with

the background.**

- General I.A. SEROV was Chairman of tie KGB when

the first information about POPOV's agent status was

received.

In summary, what GOLITSIN has said about the compromise indicates

that a KGB agent provided the lead to POPOV and that this lead

was received in 1957 or 1958.

As stated above, POPOV's message of 18 September 1959 said

he had been arrested in the previous February: 1f this

portion of the message is correct, the orientation there-

fore indicates that the KGB observed the first LANGELLE-

POPOV brush contact, on 4 January 1959, and POPOV was

arrested some time after the second brush contact; on

21 January 1959.

here or /may be/ on TDY, but he has just come recently."

(A year later POPOV reported that ZHUKOV was still in

Berlin/Karlghorst working, he believed, in Anglo-American

operations.)

It would thus appear that the KGB sent

ZHUKOV to Berlin not long before 23 November 1957 and in

connection with the investigation of POPOV.

gence (MI-6) penetration agent whose arrest by the kos was

announced

2 November 1962.

In i subsequent debriefings and in-

further information on certain

aspects of the PENKOVSKIY compronize, continuing

to maintain that

it was brought about by KGB gurveillance in Moscor during 19620

Also according to NOSENKO, it was not until the latter stages of

the operation

that the KGB realized American Intelligerce was

involved with MI-6 in this operation.

The reports by NOSENKO and other sources on the PENKOVSKIY

compromise are presented below, but to place them in context.

they are preceded by a brief summary of the PENKOVSKIY operation

the CIA and MI-6 standpoint.

(ii) Resume of the PENKOVSKIY Operation

In August 1960 PENKOVSKIY gave two American tourists

a pack-

age of materials to deliver to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

These

materials included a description of a proposed dead drop site at

Number 2 Pushkin Street, which PENKOVSKJY had selected for a pos-

sible communication channel; in the letter PENKOVSKIY enclosed in

the package, he also gave his home telephone number and instructions

for a call to be placed to him at a certain time to indicate that

the package had been received and that the Americans were interested

in further contact with him. Efforts to make this teephone con-

tact with PENKOVSKIY failed, as did several additional efforts on

his part to establish contact with the U.S. Embassy.

in the vestibule of this building. (on

December 1961, John

ABIDIAN, U.S. Embassy Security Officer

also went inside the building to check for possible joading of the

dead drop by PENKOVSKIY.) In April 1961, PENKOVSKIY succeeded 1n

making contact in Moscow with the British businessian, Greville

MoscoW by WYNNE. Through WYNNE, PENKOYSKIY passed to MI-6 docu

ments and notice of his forthcoming trip to London in April.

operation until it was terminated by the KGB on 2 November 1962.

Throughout this period PENKOVSKIY served in a GRU element

under cover of the State Committee for Science and Technology

(GKKNR) in Moscow, and it was under GKKNR cover that PENKOVSKIY.

travelled abroad three times, to England in April-May and July-

August 1961 and to France in September-October 1961. In addition.

to PENKOVSKIY's personal meetings with American and British case:

officers while on these IDY's, there were 27 exchanges of

materials in Moscow.

The CIA and MI-6 intermediaries used for

these exchanges were WYNNE, on his business trips to the USSR; Mrs.

Anne CHISHOLM, wife of an MI-6 officer stationed at the British

Embassy; * L

(b) Reports on the Compromise

when asked in January i96d nether he knew how PENKOVSKIY

was

compromised, NOSENKO answered that he had "all the details"

and

then gave the following account:

Ever since the POPOV case

had

(see Part VI.D.7.a.) there

been intensive

and

surveillance of personnel from

the U.S.

British Embassies in Moscow.

As a result of this sur

veillance, Mrs. CHISHUL' was seen ducking into an alcove.

evidentiy

following a Soviet citizen whom the surveillance

team was unable

to identify.

Surveillance coverage of

Mrs. CHISHOL! - and, indeed, on all British Embassy per-

sonnel - was immediately increased, and she was soon

observed following the same Soviet citizen on the street

in a clandestine manner.

The Soviet citizen was identi-

fled as PENKOVSKIX®

The KGB immediately launched a full investigation

of PENKOVSKIY, including a complete check of his back-

ground.

To avoid alerting him, knowledge of the investi

gation was kept to a minimum, and surveillance of him was

restricted to stationary points in the neighborhood of

his residence and office.

As one part of the investiga-

tion, a man who closely resembled PENKOVSKIY and dressed

like hin was made to walk in front of Mrs. CHISHOLM when

she was on a Moscow street; when she began to follow

this man, the KGB thus obtaired confirmation of its

identification of PENKOVSKIY.

Another part of the in-

vestigation entailed a search of the PENKOVSKIY apartment:

to accomplish this,

he was given a drug which made him

60 ill

that hospitalization was necessary, and. Mrs.

PENKOVSKIY was lured from the apartment on a ruse: nothing

was fourd during this search.

The KGB next aimed a power-

ful telescope at the window in PENKOVSKIY's apartment and

obtained an apartment directly above his; from: the over-

hanging balcony of the apartment occupied by the KGs some

flower pots were suspended, one of them able to take

pictures through the window of the apartment below; in

this manner the KuB photographed PENKOVSKIY removing

"suspicious materials" from the back part of his desk:

in the search of the apartment which followed, these

materials were found in the desk, but the KGB left them

there.

By the time while visited Moscow ir. July 1962, both

he and PENKOVSKIY were under surveillarce, and their suz-

picious behavior in front of the feking Restaurant on

5 July gave the KGB another conclusive indicator of PENKOV

activities.

Also, the KGB was able to monitor

conversations between PENKOVSKIY and AYNNE in the latter's

hotel room, despite

the fact that PEIKOVSKIY turned on

water faucets while they were talking.

PENKOVSKIX was arrested only when the KGB knew that

WYNNE was scheduled to go to a Satellite country.

SKIY gave a complete confession, and it was only at this

point that the KGE realized American Intelligence was in-

volved in the operation.

After PENKOVSKIY revealed details

about the Pushkin

Street deas drop, the KG correlated this

information with that contained ir

was apprehended there.

The KGB felt that it had obtained all pertinent in-

formation from PPKOVSKIY and that he was "beyond redemp-

even for future interrogation. PENKOVSKIY was

In subsequent questioning soon after his defection, NOSENKO

repeatedly claimed that the KGB had no prior knowledge of erican

Intelligence participation in the PENKOVSKIY operation until

JACOB's arrest on 2 November 1962 at the Pushkin Street dead drop.

NOSENKO was asked in July 1964 for details on the KGB

official report (obzor) about the PENKOVSKIY case.

He said that

he had rever read the report because, although printed, it had

not been circulated as of the time of his departure for Geneva

in January 1964•

By O.M. GRIBANOV (Chief of

Second Chief

Directoratel and "various other case officers," however, NOSENKO

was told of certain of the items which would appear in

official report and most of which he had already reported. The

fact that the KGB surveillance

tean had failed to identify

PENKOVSKIY at his first observed meeting with Mrs, CHISHOLM,

NOSENKO added at this time, would not be included in the report.

According to GRIBANOV, whereas the report would state the KGB

knew PENKOVSKIY was working for both the British and American

services, in reality the KGB did'not know of the Americans'

involvement until PENKOVSKIY was arrested.

With regard to this

latter point, NOSENKO said that the KGB investigation of PENKOV-

SKIY was handled by officers from: the British Department: rather

than the American Department of the XGB Second Chief Directorate,

except for V.M. KOVSHUK of the latter department Furthermore,

NOSENKO stated,

the KGb interrogators attempted to force JACOB

to admit he was a British citizen."

In February 1965 NOSENKO provided his most complete account

of the PENKOVSKlY compromise and the KG3 investigation which

ensued:

•The first that PE:XOVSKIY apreared in life of the

KGB was during one of MYNE's visits to Moscow.

knew of PENKOVSKIY's acquaintance with dYNE and that he

was even visiting him in the hotel where WYNNE was

staying.

The KGS checked with the GRU,

GRU answered that

PENKOVSKIY was working on wYNNE as a target,

was working in the GiziR as a cover, and MYNNE was one of

his acquaintances.

Later, there was massive surveillance

of the emplojees of the British Embassy - I don't know

exactly with whom - but PEKOVSKIY was noticed being in

contact with someone from the British

Embassy: but sur-

veillance lost him...

Later he was nosiced with the wife

of British Embassy officer CHISHOLM.

At this point, the

KGB didn't tell the GRU anything, because the GRU had no

right to have any contact with any foreign embassy people

without telling the KCB - except at official receptions

and functions.

and even here they have to tell the KGB

so that surveillance will know.

And when surveillance

noticed PENKOVSKIY with Mrs. CHISHOLM. they immediately

recognized him as the guy they had lost.

"This was the beginning of the

very active work on

PENKOVSKIY - without telling the GRU.

They (the British

Department, KGB Second Chief Directcrate) were checking

his work at the CiNR,

They were

put him under regular surveillance because he would

immediately find out - he was a capable officer - but

they put surveillance on him from time to time. However.

they set up a closed (fixed surveillance) post in a

building opposite his apartment, about 200 meters

They got a flat there, set up a post, and watched his

window with a telescope.

They also used the flat directly

above PENKOVSKIY's flat. Here they even put microphones

to hear his conversations with his wife and tapped the

telephone of course,

Then they noticed that he was hiding

something in his desk, taking the drawer out and putting

something behind,

And when he was taking off his shirt

he was putting notes

(inside).

They noticed him taking

pictures.

Above his flat there was a balcony with

flower boxes.

They put a camera in the flowers somehow

which could be lowered so that it could take pictures

through PENKOVSKIY's window by command (remote control)

from the closed post.

This was to get evidence, to

see the documents he was working with.

"There was another meeting with wYNNE.

But the KGB manaçed to intercept

the conversation - not everything,

but several words indis

cating there was something incriminating.

PETiKOVSKIY

called WYNNE

and they agreed to meet

at the Peking Restau

rant, out PENKOVSKIY was checking (for survelliance) and

did not go with WhiNE into the restaurant as they had

agreed, but walked about the city with hin.

Surveillance

tried to monitor their conversation from a

distance of 200

meters with a special microphone like a lorg. pipe. one meter

long, or maybe a little less.

"They decided to enter PENKOVSKIY's apartment and see

what was hidden in his desk.

In the GRU they controlled

what documents PENKOVSKIY was taring...

"They used a drug to pur him in the tospital, a pre-

paration which they put or his chair:

He irnaled it irto

His skin became reddened and he

felt pain and had to go to a dostor, a military doctor who

put him immeciately in the hospital.

He went to a military

hospital - they were ready for him there - and was hospital-

disguised as a soldier cane to PENKOVSKIY's flat and told

his wife that the doctors wanted her to be checked because

it was possible PENKOVSKIY had a contagious disease. not

serious reys had been made before.

She went to the hospital, and the flat was

tered.

They took pictures of

everything.

They found many things, code pads and so on,

which

showed that he was really working. Ater that they

decided to arrange his arrest.

"PENKOVSKIY was supposed to go abroad, and the KGB

did everything to prevent it, but in such a ray that he

wouldn't understand.

They even cancelled a whole deleça-

tion.*

This was while they were still trying to get proof.

"Then WYNNE came to Hungary,

They arrested PENKOVSKIY

and I think one or two days later they took wYNNe.

"The manner of arresting PENKOVSKIY was such that

even GRU wouldn't know about it, (D. M.) GVISHIANI (head

of the CKKNR) took part.

He told PENKOVSKIY to come with

him to the Central Cormittee, and when they were down in

his car he said: "Wait here a minute while I ger a docu

ment I forgot."

There was an entrance

but the car was in the courtyard behind.

PENKOVSKIY got in the car, and that was

it - he couldn't call out, no one saw it.

"Two days later I know that (General S.G,) BANNIKOV

I don't know the details of

WYNNE's arrest, but I know that BANNIKOV returned with

"I know that during the search PENKOVSKIY's daughter.

came home from school early.

I know that one of PENKOV-

SKIY's female relatives or one of his wife's female rela-

tives was a former KGB agent, and she intercepted the

girl...

"MIS. CHISHOLM was walking on the street and they.

dressed a man just like PENKOVSKIY - he entered a telephone

booth or an apartment house entrance or something.

She saw

him. It was necessary that they see each other at a dis

tance before making contact.

BONDAREY asked JACOB to confirm

They were expecting an English-

The First Department was stunned

when they found out that an American had come to Pushkin

"The first time the KGB saw PENKOVSKIY and WYNNE

together they asked the GRU about it. I think even (GRU

The KGB played for WYNNE two tape recordings of conversa-

that the zecordings were genuine) pinpointed the dates when the

cunversations were heid:

27 May 1961 and 2 July 1962.

The 27 May

1961 conversation was the one in which PENKOVSKIY mentioned his

girlfriend

"ZEP"; it further consisted of an exchange of cryptic

remarks as PENKOVSKIY indicated to MYNNE that he had material

he wanted to pass to him.

until recently when he told the man to stop at his office,

as he had just done that day.

RAYNOND added that the person

had offered information of a kind that he did not feel he

him again later the same day in his office in the Enbassy.

Before an approach could be made under any set of circuu-

stances, the enme American military attache had a half-hour

conversation with CHEREPANCV while attending the Soviet En-

bassy's lod Army Day reception in February 1934. The at-

teche used each of the goveral occastons when the two were

alone to probe under various pretexts for CHEREPANOV's desires

regarding a further contact, but CHEREPAJO! responded either

with noncomitial answere or not at all.

Two years later, in February 1956, It wis reported that

PAYOY statod that he was roturniny to loscow where he hoped

to be assigned for & year or two, but he was not certain.

According to a report dated June 1956, CHEREPAYOV had

Bolgrade, and as of the time of the report, had gone

to the USSR "probably to work in the foreiga Office,"

In 1057 by Milos GREGOVIC,

The main reason for the UDB certainty about this

was the wide scope of his contacts with Yugoslav workers

*The break betwaen Yugoslavia and the Cominform took place

in June 1948.

and there was no Soviet military attache representation pre

According to the Yugoslav diploratic

11gts, Aleksandr CHEREPANOV arrived in Belgrade sometime in

1952, appearing on the diplonatic list for the first time in

November 1952, as Second Secretary.

He was one of only

seven Soviete appearing on the diplonitle list at this

time.

The now Soviet Ambassador appeared for the f1rgt time

on the November 1953 list, bringing the total diplomatic

and students, a number of whom were arrested by the LDB on

suspicion.

On several occasions the UDB had felt it had

almost enough evidence

to enable the Yugosla: Government to

expel CHEREPANOV, but the evidence was never completely

satisfactory®

Thus in 1954 GREGOVIC was assigned the task.of com

promising CHEREPANOV's wife, Irene.

Approximately three

months after he met her, CREGOVIC

persorally.succeeded in

compromising Irene.

He continued to handle her as an in

formant over a period of about a year and a half, during

which time he also maintained their personal relatiorship

on a spasmodir basis.

Irene's information enabled the UDB

to discover that CHEREPAYOV had established a norwork of

Informants

anone workers and

students,

mostly

in Belgrade

and its vicirity.

Subsequent information established

the

fact that he was also in close contact

with trade undon

leaders and particularly with river

port workers,

a number

of whom were subsequently found to be

anti-Yugoslay and pro-

Soviet in their outlook.

Another Soviet,

an

intelligence

officer who had been recruited by the UDE, contirred

to

GREGOVIC that CHEREPANOV was a nember of Soviet Irtelligence.

The Soviet said also that CHEREPANOV had been an intelligence

officer during the war and had at one stage been parachuted

behind the German lines on a special services operation

which resulted in the kidrapping of a German general.

GREGOVIC described CHEREPANOV as "always smiling but

in fact an extremely cold and cruel individual."

Although

he did not appear to be enotionally attsched to his wife,

he was extrenely jealous aid watchful of her.

He frequently

urged his wife to use her exceptional beauty and seductive

charn in cultivating Yugoslav officials in

order to obtain

information.

GRECOTIC also said that CHEREPANO! LaS VEry

"appeared to give relief to his ex-

cessively sadistic nature.

CHEREPANOV was recalled to Moscow in mid-1956, according

to CREGOVIC.

He

explained his interest in obtalning second-hand books.

In a few minutes an Engiish-speaking Soviet was seat to

After discussing the librarian's needs

with him, the wan agreed to cooperate with the Arericas.

There were three more contacts with ChEREPANOr, all 10 the

October 1960) and Wallace L. LITTELL, Attacie

from June

1956 to July 1958 (document dated October 1900).

There are four operational plans for agra: work

against American diplomats stationed in Moscow at the

time the plans were prepared:

Richard HARMSTUNE, Second

Secretary (document of August 1958; Lewis hi. EOWDEN,

Second Sceretary (document of Feduary 1960'; Cam-s

RAMSEY, Second Secretary (document of February 1960);

and George WINTERS, Attache (on date).****

*One paragraph

of the document refers to American surveil

lance of

Soviets in New York City, and the next paragraph

begins:

"The intensity

of surveiliance was uneven.

From

November. 1957 to April 1958 a decrease

was noticed in the nun-

ber of

surveillance teams assigned to work directly against

Soviet employees.

This did not mean, however, that the Ameri

can surveillance service reduced its surveillance of Soviet

employees as a whole."

The dates cited here approximate the

period, from

late November 1957 to mid-Jarch 1958,

when the

FBI was conducting surveillance of two Illegals in New York

City as an outgrowth of an operational lead fron CIA source

POPOV (see Part VI.D.7.a.).

Information from SOSEYKO rela-

ting to FBl surveillance is discussed in Part VI.F.

who served in Washington, D.C., under the alfas

"FOSIN."

"request for finarcial a1d--

5,000 rubles," "complaints about inability to live os

Under two of the names a note appears,

to the Anerican Department because of the costact with

an American diplonat.)

*On 24 May 1958 LANGELLE visited the area of the dead drop

site referred to herein with his wife to case and photograch

the site area.

The site had been described to him as a

certain section of a wooden staircase

in the park area.

When his report was received at CIA Headquarters it was

obvious that because of

inadequate information, he had

cased the wrong staircase, so he was told to go back as

soon as possible and repcat the casing for the other stair-

case.

He did this on 28 May 1958,

bringing his children

for

cover.

He did not put a drop down at this or any other

time.

A

legal travel agent actually put the drop down on

7 June

1958.

This drop

was

not intended for the agent re-

ferred to in the CHEREPANOV document, REPNIKOV, wro in fact

was not even a recruited agent at the time, although efforts

were being made-unsuccessfully-during this time to recruit

him.

At no time was any dead drop put down for REPNIKOr,

NOSENKO's Comments on the CILEREPASOV PapEr$

On 3 February 1964 NOSENKO was

shown all the CHEREPArOV

papers with the exception of the FEKLISOV report on opera-

tional conditions in

the Urited States.

Just before they

given to him to read,

shown

NOSENKO was asked if he had been

the pepers before he left loscow; ne replied that he

had not.

He said he knew that the documents pertained to

BOWDEN, RAISEY, HARUSTONE, WINTERS, and LASCELE,

but he

had not read them.

Asked

who in the Second Chirt Cirectorate

kner exactly which docunents were involved, NOSENKO named

S. M. FEDOSEYEV, Chief of the

Ameriran Dopart-tat it the tine;

GRIBAYOY,

Chief of

the second Chief Directorate; sod G.I.

GRYAZNOV,

Chief'of

the U.S. Emoass? Section.

Those three

officers,

he said:

had

possession of the docum-its after

they were returned by iiD to the KCB.

NOSENKO then proceeded to examine and ried aloud ths

contents of the docurents, making «ccasional ixpiaratory

comments as he went along.

lie identified the randwriting

of CHEREPANOV himself, as well as that of KISkUi, KOVSHLK, and

BELOGLAZOV. Concerning the

substance of the documents, Y0-

SENKO made

few comments.

in discussing the opcrational

plan for work against MINTERS, NOSENKO noted that this docu-

which was a hardsritten draft, had been sigied by

KOVSHIK, Chief of the U.S. Embassy

Sectior; SOSENKO then said:

"He should not have signed this.

I do not know why he signed

He should not have signed it." Asked why not, he said:

"Because it 1s

a drait.

He should have sigrd the typed

Ard why he signed the rough draft I do rot krow..."

As he studied the agent report which KO SIlk receired

from source "LILIANA," concerning WINIERS, NOSENKO cormented

on KOVSHUK's failure to fill in the line

which is intended

to identify the safe apartnent or operational apartment

where the report was rceived.

"It is obligatory

to indis

cate the place, in the second line," he added.

"it is

obligatory to write in the number of the persoral iile (this

did appear in the document) and where the contact took place."

Reading aloud the agent plan for BowdEn, described

thereid as the fBl man in the Embassy, NOSENKO came to the

section which states:

"Ironically one day as though by

chance he (BOWDEN] blurted out to our agent SHiELOVA'

'ARTUR'S* affiliation with American Intelligence." He was

interrupted to be asked who "SHUEDOVA" was; NOSENKO said:

"Cleaning woman undoubtedly.

An affiliatior of 'ARTUR" with

American Intelligence."

He

was then asked:

"What connec

tion did 'ARTUR' have with American Intelligence?"

To this

*"ARTUR" was the KGB cryptonym for NOSENKO's agent Arsene

FRIPPEL; see Part V.D.5.

NOSENIO replied:

"That I cannot say." The CIA case officer

remarked:

"Why, you

should know, sou're his case officer..."

NOSESSO ignored this comment and

continued to read the docu

ment aloud.

A little further on in the document reference

is made to use of future agents to report on BORDEN; again

"ARTIH" is ment.oned, and NOSENKO identified nim this time

as FRIPPEL.

Then he

said:

"I asked FRIPPEL, and he said

'But I know nothirg."

"How is it you do not, when ho is

the counterintelligence man in your Embassy?

He interrogates

you!"

And he answered:

'But no, he is a good man.""

In reading a draft report which appears to nave been

an attcopt to summarize the KGB information on WINTERS, NO-

SENKO read out the sentence:

"During his

stay in the USSR,

WINTERS sent eight

espionage letters,* and loaded a drop

ligence."

He was asked if he knew about those elcht lotters.

but he sald he did not.

NOSENKO retorted:

at that time I would not have run him

He did not know that he had letka on him.**

the jear 1962 did you know about writka? do, I don't believe

jou did."

he was asked:

letters were detected from Metka? NOSENKO said:

"Of course."

The case officer asked:

"Not Iron surveillance?" NOSESKO

Beyond the fact that he could be

seen nailing

then, the rest Metka gives.. Well, that letter which was

mailed by WINTERS to FOPOV was without Metka.

for POPOV definitely was without botke. But the other

letters, that was not so.

I would not blame him.

How would

He put them in his pocket--that's all." NOSENKO

added that the lette' which was sent to POPOV was one of the

eigbt letters to which the document refers.

NOSENKO then reviewed the document concerning Richard

STONE had been compromised and had been approached by the KGB,

that be turned down the recruitment offer, but that he did

not report the approach to the u.s. Embassy.

how the KGB knew that he had not reported the approsch, to

which NOSENKO replied:

"He was monitored and we would have

if anything about this matter had been re-

ported.:: Undoubtedly if he reported it

something would have

been heard fron the Minister Counsellor's materials as to

this might be.

Ard they would dictate a message about

this."**** Later NOSENKO was asked who tried to recruit HARNSTONE.

**The first source of information on KGB use of Metka, the

KGB code rame for thief powder or detecting powder,

Was

NOSENKO, in June 1962.

***See Section VI.D.3.e. for a discussion of the HARISTONE case.

****HARMSTONE did report the KGB approach, and the Minister

Counsellor's office was the site of a discussion of the case.

Into the departient. This was in the year 1953 or 1959.

I don't know who was the case officer who spoke to RARi

STONE. "

*CSENKO waS

asked:

"Is he still in the bepartment?"

He replied:

"I don't think he is. i don't think he is

concersed with it any more."*

NOSE KO read the document which set forth highlights

Of LANGELLE's operational activities

in Moscow, chiefly

devoted to the POPOV case, but also including information

(inaccurate in

detail) concerning a dead drop site in Lenin

Hills.*

As be read this section he commented:

"Incidentally,

they (the KGBl found the dead drop and contents by accident.

Little children, children."

Asked if kc knew arything about

this incident of Lenin Hills, he arswered,

"Kids•

Russian

children found it by accident.

For after LANGELLE had left

the area, surveillance checked over the area, but they found

nothing....

Reading further he come to the statement that

it was later establisied that the dead drop was interded

for the person already arrested by the KCB,

REPYJKOV.

To

this he added that REPNIKOV was known as Stanisia? "Slava"

REPNIKOV, who had been recruited by some tourist; these de

tails were not included in the CHEREPANOV documert.

He was

asked if REPNIKOV had been arrested and was chereafter

working under KGB control, but he said this was not the case.

ile explained that he had been arrested, and the YüB there-

after

"roughed him up once in a while"

because he was of the

category of Soviets who were known to associate with foreigners.

He did not know what American tourist had recruited REPNIKOV,:

but he was aware of the fact that REPNIKOV had not beer

arrested until after the tourist had left the l'SSR.#**

When he was reviewing the sumar; of inforcation on

LITTEL, who had left the USSR before the sunmary was pre-

pared, NOSENKO was asked if he knew anything about one of

the soviets named as a one-time contact of LITrEL's, B.P.

VORONTSO!. The document, a rough draft with corrictions,

contalled a statement that a moeting between LITEL and

*KOVSHUK was identified by HARUSTONE as the KGB officer who

made the approach.

**See the foregoing section on the contents of the CHERE-

PANOV package for details on the inaccuracies included in

this document.

#**REPNIKOV had been reported as a dissident Soviet youth

as early as 1955,

and in 1957 he told one of his American

contacts that he

had once been arrested and served time in

a Soviet prison at some time for one of his attempts to

escape illegally

fron the USSR.

He was arrested sgain there-

after for a second plan for escape, and he was given psycho-

logical treatment as a result.

REPNIKOV was

in contact with

& number of Americans and

other Western travellers again in

1958

and 1959.

In September 1959 another Soriet, a friend

of his,

told

an Anerican tourist that REPNIKOV had been

arrested after receiving a letter from an American which

thanked him for his interest in being an agent and gave him

directions for future contacts.

In the sumner of 1960 there..

vas a long article in Komsomolskaya Pravda

about the arrest

of REPSIKOV and a friend of his on charges of being agents of

CIA. Neither was.

VORONTSOV took place on the strect, and they went to a

restaurant together.

It further said that VORONTSOV was

continuously in contact with foreign tourists.

These two

lines are

crossed out in the draft, and in their place is

written:

"The Second (Counterintelligence and Security)

Department of the UKGB for the city of Moscow is fully

oriented concerning him." NOSENKO was told that VORONTSOV

most recently worked for Inturist at the Hotel Hetropol in

Moscow, and that he had had a number of meetings with

American students and with tourists.

NOSENKO commented:

"This is

agent work,

He is an agent." He was asked, "But

to you nothing is known?"

NOSENKO sald, "Absolutely nothing."*

NOSENKO went over the rest of

the CHEREPANOV documents

rapidly, for the most part simply reading them aloud, with

side remarks on topics unrelated to the dooomenis or the

Americans discussed therein.

*In the summer of 1963,

VORONTSOV had contacted two different

groups of joung Americans

and told

them

cape from

the

of his plans for es

Soviet Union.

He also told them

he had informa

tion about KGB agents through his Inturist employeent, and

that the American authorities should be told of hin and his

plans; he passed on an elaborate code system which was to be

used to get in touch with him to assist him in his

escape

plans. He

was so open in his contacts, unrealistic in his

plans, and insecure in his conversations with the young_Ameri

cans (none of whom had any intelligence connections) that

when they reported to American embassies in the West, VORONT-.

SOV was immediately assumed by Ü.S. authorities to be either

a clumsy provocateur or a

fanciful, immature youth.: Nothing

further was heard from VORONTSOV.

There had been no previous

record of him in CIA files; the CHEREPAYOV document was the

only confirmation of his other contacts with foreigners.

NOSENKO has not changed his

original

statement that the KGB has never been

able to break

the miiitary codes.

NOSENKO has stressed that he has no aptitude for technical

matters and had no interest in or access to information on

spe-

cific techniques used by KGB cryptologists to break the american

codes.

He suggested in general terms,

however,

that KGB suc-

cesses in this field were made possible in part by information

obtained from American cryptographic personnel who defected and

were recruited in the late 1940's

and the 1950's, in part by

information from the microphone installations in

the

two mili-

tary code roons

and certain U.S. Embassy offices.

NOSENKO has

not specified how this information was used or which of these two

categorios of sources was of

groater value,

although he did re-

port that the loss

of KGB ability to read the State Departnent

codes coincided with and was largely a result of the installation

of an acoustically secure enclosure for cryptographic operations.

(The date was late 1961 or early 1962, according to NOSENKO, but

actually late 1962, according to U.s.

authorities.) At the

same time, NOSENKO

indicated, the microphone in the military code

one mission" in 1960 and 1961 was to recruit a military code

that the hOB Eighth Directorate had broken

elements

in 1964.

le has furnished

some details on

types of Embassy

enciphered traffic being read in clear text and on the way in

which the clear text was treated within the KCB Second Chief

Directorate; in addition, NOSENKO has indicated that the KGB used

microphones

in the Embassy and exploited human sources to further

its cryptologic work. These points are reviewed separately below.

(i)

Breaking U.S. Ciphers

The first reference by NOSENKO to KGB cryptologic successes

against U.S. Government enciphered traffic was made

ond

at his sec-

neeting with ClA

11 June 1962.

At that tine he raised the

subject in connection with his personal security new that he was

in contact with CIA. He said:

"If possible, hanule things in

cables which rent from the Embassy. We had them all, down to

the last one. I saw them every day..."

During the third mecting, on 12 June 1962, NOSENTO revised

his statements sade the day before.

He now

said that only cer-

tain of the State Department codes had been broken, and that he

had only rarely seen the clear text of deciphered

cables. NOSEXKO

repeated that military cipher systems had not been

broken.

His

statements were as follows:

"Ile are reading) not

mats send.

Not we (the KGB Second Chief Directorate) but the

[KGB] Eighth Directorate.

They are reading some things."

Asked whether the KGB was reading all the State Department's

enciphered traffic or only a small part of it, NOSENKO replied:

"Not all.

We are not reading all the State Department (traffic)."

He also said, contrary to his statement of 11 July 1902 that he

saw the deciphered traffic "every day," these documents reached

him

"very seidom"--at the

Following

his defection,

NOSENKO reported that he had learned

discussing significant information over the concaled microphones

in their offices.

This der-topment had led CRYAZSOV and S.V.

FEDOSEYEV (Chief of the American Departzent) to conclude that a

"room-within-a-room" had been installed in thie tabassy and that

security reasures had been instituted there.

After his

transfer from the American Departeent in carly 1962, NOSENKO con-

tinued, he also had occasion to discuss the KGB ioss of code-

breaking capability with GRIbAYOY, Chief of the Second Chief Direc-

frow him NOSENKO learned

that the Contral Committee of the

Communist Party was

exerting considerable pressure on the Chairman

of the KGB for continuation of. the material formerly obtained in

this manner; consequently, the KCB Chairman as demanding maximum

effort from all officers

in the recrustment of code clorks.

In the second series

of hostile interrogations. on 20 February

1965, NOStSKO made the following staterent concerning KoB crypto

logic success during 1960-1961:

"Occasionally the Eignth Directo-

rate would break messages, but very, vory

seldon, and we never saw

the documerts."

(11) Handling of Deciphered Cablis

In mid-1964 NOSENKO was debricied or the procedures used by

the American Deparumeal, during nis reportrd tenuri

1961, in handling ine clear ixt of

dripteard cabies of the U.S.

Embassy.

The report of NOSENKO's staterents on this subject is as

follons: "The Russian text of those Siate Firpartment coded mes-

sages which had been broken was sent to SEllaHASINy, the Chairman

of the KGB, who sometimes forwarded it to Oleg Mikhaylovich GRI-

BANOV, Chief of the Second Chiel Directorate.

ChIBANOV at times

forwarded some of the material

to vladinar Alekseyevich KLYPIN,

Chief of the

American Department, or KiYPIN's siccessor, S.d.

NOSENKO saw such material on the desk of KLYPIN and

later on FEDOSEYEr's desk, but was never permitied lo read it.

NOSENKO knew, however, that the reader lad to sign for those

NOSENKO has twice referred to the Eighth Directorate's

interest in equipment sounds and snatches of technical conversa-

tions picked up by the microphones

in the State Department and

military code rooms.

He said on 24 January 1964:

* See Part V.E.3.g. concerning the KGB microphones in the U.S.

Embassy.

Until December 1962 when an acoustical room was installed

within the State Department to enclose cryptographic equip-

ment, teletype and code machines were vulnerable to the one

microphone

later discovered in this area.

Since that time

presumably

only the teletype equipment

could be heard.

Here

NOSENKO is speaking of the earlier period.

On 20 February.

1965 he said,

"The microphone is not in the State

Department code room,

but next door where the teletype

machines were located."

This information was true only after

the secure room was installed.

tary communications, repaired cryptographic equipment, per-

formed stand-by cryptographic duties when STORSBERG was un-

NOSENKO was more specific with regard to another source of

analytic infornation.

Questioned on 24 January 1964 concerning

recruitment and use of code clerks by the American Departaent,

NOSENKO enumerated the recruitments known to him and then said:

"As I recall, way back in 1948 or 1949,

there was a man of yours

He stayed behind.

I believe his name was MeMILLAN.*

The debriefing continued:

Question: But did not 'ANDREY' bring out military code material?

NOSENKO:

No, I believe it was only State Department material.

What he mainly did was to describe the operation of

code machines and what daily or other periodic settings

were made.***

c. V.S. Evaluations

NOSENKO's statements about the KGB microphones in the Ameri

can Embassy led to investigations by U.S. authorities which re-

sulted in damage assessments, part of which are germane to the

NOSENKO reports on KGB cryptologic successes.

"SA examined the

question of cryptographic security in light of the microphones.:

reports are given below.

(1i) USIB Security Committee Report

"The security practices and procedures. [at the American

Embassyl appear io have followed a pattern

from

April 1953 to

May 1960, at which time the first plastic lacoustical room

was installed.

A change occurred in the work habits lin May

1960) in that the more

senior State Department officers utilized

the plastic roon for

sensitive discussions and dictation.

The

room could acconmodate only a limited portion of the Embassy

classified discussions and,

accordingly, a number of classified

discussions were held outside of this secure

area.

In the April

1953-May 1960 period it was an accepted practice of the Ambassa-

dor and the Deputy Chief of Mission

to discuss openly in their

offices routine classified operations of the Enbassy and to dic-

tate classified documents and telegrams.

Extrenely sensitive

matters such as high-level political decisions, matters pert-

nent to the most sensitive U.s.- Soviet relatzonships and positive

intelligence operations were not dictated and if discussed,

were mentioned in a cryptic manner...

"In the External Political Section during the 1953-1960

Work assignments

were given at these meetings to individual officers who, in turn,

prepared classified dispatches or telegrams to the (Statel De-

partmerit.. It was reported that the officers of the External

Political Section frequently dictated classitied material, includ-

ing telegrans,

within their offices.

Officers of the Internal

Political

Section generated few classified telegrams...

were, however, typed in the offices.

From May 1960 to date (1964)

the Ambassador-DCM operation conducted their most sensitive clas-

sified discussions and actions in the acoustic room; however

routine classified day-to-day operations were discussed and dic-

tated in the offices.

Ambassador KOHLER reported that since

August 1962 he and members of his staff working on substantive

or sensitive matters utilized the secure room and that all ma-

terial to be encrypted was drafted in long-hand or dictated in

the acoustic room.

"The pattern for the External Political Section and the

Internal Political Section remained basically the

same during

the period of May I960 to the present time; however, the most

sensitive matters were discussed or dictated in the acoustic

room. or drafted in longhand...

In September 1962 the second

acoustic room was erected for the typing section for the handi.

ing of sensitive classified material.

From December 1963 to

date it was indicated that no classified telegrams have been

dictated outside of the acoustic rooms. It was

stated, however,

that the day-to-day operations including analysis of develop-

ments within

the Soviet Union were openly discussed in various

offices and the conclusions reached later became the basis of

classified documents or telegrams...

"The military attaches reported that most cables were

drafted

in longhand or typed by the

originator and then turned

over to the code clerks for transmission.

In certain

instances

cables were dictated in the offices..."

Introduction

NOSENKO, as previously indicated, came to Geneva

with the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference in mid-March

1962 and established contact with CIA in June of that year.

His arrival in. Geneva and his first meeting with CIA thus

occurred three months and six months, respectively, after

Anatoliy Mikhailovich GOLITSYN defected to CIA from the KGB

Legal Residency in lielsinki, on 15 Lecember 1961,*

and was ex-

filtrated to the United States.

A discussion of what GOLITSYN said about NOSENKO appears in

Part V.I.7.

Presented below are, first, a surmary on GOLITSYN,

then

survey comparing GOLITSYN's and NOSENKO's leads, and finally,

a protocol on GOLITSYN which NOSENKC signed.

2.

Background Information on GOLITSYN

GOLITSYN, a KGB counterintelligence. officer, was assigned

the soviet

Embassy in Helsinki in July 1960 under the alias

of Anatoliy KLIMOV.

In defecting to CIA, he provided more than

20 documents taken from the lielsinki KGB Legal Residency files

as well as extensive information about KCB officers

tions acquired during his 16-jear carear in the KGB.

GOLITSYN had had a variety of job and training assignments

in the First Chief Directorate in Moscow and training assignments

in the Second Chief Directorate.**

spent in work against the American target for the First Chief

Directorate; this was his responsibility in llelsinki and had

also been his principal area of responsibility during his pre-

vious tour abroad, in Vienna from 1953 to 1955.

ter assignment he had been known to Petr DERYABIN, who defected

to CIA in 1954, and this was the reason for GOLITSYN being

assigned to Helsinki under alias.)

Among the GOLITSYN documents was a study of American In-

telligence operations exploiting tourists visiting the USSR,

the so-called "legal travel program."*i*

This study, which

rung to sixteen pages in translation, was prepared in KGB

Headquarters and was

sent to the Helsinki

Legal Residency under

a cover letter, dated 7 April 1961, which suggested a number

: of steps to be

taken in order to counter such operations.

The study was based on two principal sources:

According to NOSENKO, GOLITSYN defected on of about 15 Janu i.

ary 1962, after NOSENKO had been reassigned to the Tourist

Department.

** As a result of this service, GOLITSYN was the original

source of numerous leads to

identifiable penetrations

of kestern Governments, including agents with access

to classified information such as William VASSALL (see

Part VI.D.5.b.) and the French officer in NATO, George

GOLETSYN arquired

further information

about such

called on him for support or chatted with him about officers and

operatiors.

a.: Microphones in the U.S. Enbassy

In his visits to the Americar. Departmert GOLITSYN learned

by accident of KGB technical operations against the U.S. Embassy

*

NOSENKO denied that GOLITSYN visited the American Department

at any time in 1960.

**Although knowing that GOLITSYN went to the American Depart-

ment in 1961, NOSENKO said that the month was not January

out July, for it was in July that he 'NOSENKO) was on leave:

SOLITSYN's passport, however, verifies he was in the Soviet

Union in January 1961 and shows no entries for July of that

in Moscow.

When

asked in April 1962 about the product from such

operations, GOLIISIN said he had heard about results tony times,

but the only concrete example he was in a position to give was

the following:

During one of his visits to the American Depart-

ment in 1960* he heard and saw that a report or reports of the

results of audiosurveillance in the U.S. anbassy lud been lost.

While he was present, the Department Chief ordered all the per-

sonnel to search once nore for these papers, and ar GOLITSYN

stood there they went through ail their files.

GOLITSYN said

he could see that there were many

such reports, each having a red

line on it, which signified that these reyorts were the property

of that department of the KGB Operational Technical Directorate

(OTU)

which was responsible for making

the installations.

explained that this meant that

He

the American Department had to re=

turr the reports to that directorate, and this was the reason for

a search being made.

The only cffice

in the U.s. Enbassy which

was specifically menticned in connection with this search was

that of the Minister Counselor.**

He has also incorrectly

states that he visited tie depart-

ment in December 1960 (his passport and CIA travel records

have been referring to this inter visit.

assy, and he said at that time that he had seen intercept

reports of conversations or dictations by successive Mini-

In 1965 NOSENKO Volunteered a story about

he loss of one of the intercept repcrts which the imerican

Department had received in 1950 or 1961; he identified it

as one which recorded the Minister Counsello: giving dicta-

tion.

According to NOSENKO, the Anerican Department was

turned upside down for a month, December, in the search

for the missing report.

Although the document was never

found, neither the Chief of the American Department nor

O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, was

subjected to any punishment because the draft from which

the missing report had been typed was found to be in the

possession of the Second Department of oTU.

From this the

investigators concluded that the document itself had pro-

bably been returned to the OTU and burned,

and that in-

advertently no paper had been executed to record its des-

truction.

Leads to Operations Against U.S. Embassy Not Covered by

ROSENKO

GOLITSYN Icported on six operations against personnel of

the v.3. Embassy

in Moscow which have

not appeared in the re-

porting by NOSENKO. **

These operations are summarized below.

GOLITSYN heard in about 1957 of the recruitment of a female

'employee--"like a secretary"--of the U.S. Embassy:

American girl, she had travelled to Georgia in 1957. There the

KGB placed in

her path a KGB agent, a Georgian male.

They be-

gan living together, and this relationship continued ir Moscow

where she was recruited.

GOLITSYN's lead to the American recruited with PREISPREUND! 9

help is equated to STORSBERG on the basis of NOSE:RO's and

PREISFREUND's statements that FREISFREUND participated in no

other operation.

GOLITSYN reported that the target of this

operation was Iccruited: NOSENKO reported that STORSBERG. I€-

jected the KGB appreach.

** By virtue of his position as Deputy Chief of the V.S. Emb-

assy Section in 1960

and 1961, NOSENKU said, he was directly

responsible for knowing of all KGB operations agains: person-

nel at the Embassy ir that period and definitely would have

known of any successes since his earlier tour;

This subject came up in a discussion of GOLITSYN's forth

coming assigment to llelsinki, and SOLITSYN was told that if the

agent was transferred to Helsinki, GRYAZNOV might let GOLITSYN

have him as his agent. GRYAZHOY gave GOLITSYN ro details about

the operation other than the fact that the agent had provided the

KGB with some information and the KGB considered him "a real agent."

Also in the spring of 1960, GOLITSYN learned from GRYAZSOV

that he, GRYAZNOV, had developed an operation against a military

code clerk at the

U.S. Embassy to the point that the KGB was "99

per cent sure" that the target would be recruited.

'From the

accounts given by NOSENKO

and STORSBERG, this does not appear to

concern the STORSPEPG operation, which was just beginnirg at this

NOSENKO has mentioned no other operation against a nilitary

code clerk.

I.Y. KURILENKO told GOLITSYN that while serving in the U.s.

embassy Section he had followed an American diplomat returning

the United States in 1959, and there he had completed the recruit-

ment which had begun while the diplomat was assigned to the u.g.

Embassy in Moscow.*

According to KURILENKO, he had travelled to

the United States under cover of the Soviet Exhibit Committee.

GRYAZNOV informed GOLITSYN in April

or May 1960 that an

However, SHELEPIN, who had just become Chairman of

the KGB, was stressing ideological rather than blacknail recruit-

ments at this time; SHILEPIN said that this method of approach was

"too dirty" and the KGB should find another way.

SHELEPIN did

not exclude the future use of the photographs, which the KGB would

Another case mentioned by GRYAZNOV to GOLITSYN was that of

the attempted recruitment of an American female secretary on the

basis of her relationship with a KGB agent, either a lover or a

close friend.

The agent, with the help of a KGB officer, tried

to influence her, but failed.

She left the USSR prior to July

1960, but the KGB pianned to work on her again, as she was to

return to Moscow.

On a TDY trip to Helsinki in November 1960, V.V. KOSOLAPOV

of the U.S. Embassy Section told GOLITSYN that he had come there

in order to ride basi. to Moscow on the train with a U.S. Embassy

code clerk with whom he planned to strike up an acquaintance to

be continued in Moscow.**

In about September 1961 a friend of:

KOSOLAPOV's came to Helsinki on TDY, and GOLITSYN tried to get

him to talk about KOSOLAPOV's train operation, but he would not

From this GOLITSYN was certain that the re

cruitment had been successful.

GOLITSYN learned from V.M. KOVSHUK, apparently in January 1961,

that the Finnish agent. Johan PREISFREUND had recently been used in

the successful recruitment of an American at the U.S. Embassy•

NOSENKO has described no

successful operations in which PREISFREUND

took part (see preceding section).

NOSENKO said that there was no operational reason for KURILENKO's

travel to the United States at the time of the Soviet Exhibition

in New York City, and that KURILENKO's duties related only to

security; the KGB Resident in New York City, NOSENKO added, could

have given KURILENKO some special task if he wished.

At the second meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO

Also at this meeting NOSENKO conmented that:

- "If your surveillance comes up on the radio, they

The practice of KGB case officers was not to

proceed directly

from a Soviet installation to a meeting

with an agent,
