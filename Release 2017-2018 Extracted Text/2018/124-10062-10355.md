Background
sus ano DE; {Paz, or Miss GARRO as Mr. THOMAS calls
her, is a well Known figpre in Mexican political, social and

literary circles. She was a playwright and well known to many
leg Posie of the Embassy including the then Ambassador FULTON
FREEMAN, the then Deputy Chief of Mission CLARENCE A./BOONSTRA,
zy (a@nd-many others. All of those officials expressed td¢'me on
various occasions the opinion that Miss GARRO is a véry interesti:
person and a scintillating conversationalist, but that she has a
vivid imagination and frequently appears to be unable to distingu:
= between truth and fiction. Although interesting, they all conside
Ga-her as highly unreliable as a source of information except for
Mr. THOMAS who apparently placed consistent credence in what Miss

who. acquired this intelligence information, I feel a
responsibility for seeing it through to its final evaluation.’
It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS. bags ow decided that he

decide how the story given by Misg, GARRO? is: o be evaluated.-

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-
ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction
of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate the action taken by that agency is, of course,
untenable.

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS' judgment is
raisedfby item 3 of ‘paragraph 10 of his memorandum furnished to ]
the Secretary of State. Any reference to the )
relationship between the head of CIA Mexico ama—cop-—wexrcam
officials, if true, is a very highly classified matter and any
"leak" or revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such
an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political
situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as
to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation
has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban
allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in
Havana was acting as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the (3°

Government “&% Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highly
classified reference in a memorandum which he classified y
as "confidential", contrary to regulations relative to classification -
of documents. While this reference relates to the activities and
operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of
primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the
Bureau's attention for consideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS"
current allegations.

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded
for use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to
Dallas which received a copy of referenced letter ./¢
