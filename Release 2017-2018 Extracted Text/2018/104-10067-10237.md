8 June 1978 Why was SYNDER's personnel file flagged for this special treatment?

(EYES ONLY)

oLc No. 78-2095

2. What additional information concerning SYNDER is (or was) on file in
OD/Pers?

Why was there no written indication in the file on 27 January 1978
noting that the "additional information" had, in fact, been merged
into the personnel file?

What statements concerning SYNDER were ever made by a DCI?

What "matter of cover" regarding SYNDER was the Agency seeking to
protect?

What was this project and to what extent, if any, did SYNDER parti-
cipate in it? [Project 9D-1-SGHOUSE]

For how long a period was SYNDER paid from unvouchered funds?

Did these payments continue after SYNDER ostensibly resigned from the
Agency on 21 September 1950?

After SYNDER's apparent resignation from the Agency, did he ever
work, directly or indirectly, in any capacity for the CIA?

What is the term "S-8"?

Why does the form fail to indicate specifically that SYNDER was
leaving the CIA to accept employment with the Department of State?

What was the specific basis for this classification? [CI case]

What does the code designation 737 mean?

What does this notation mean? [Restricted to CI/OA being sent for

clearance]

Why was the notation made?

What do these notations mean?
