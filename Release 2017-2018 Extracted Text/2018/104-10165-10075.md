received the requirements) be terminated. 7 |

memorandum to Chief, DCS, which reviewed the case, noted a
Brun bad been guilty of sloppy security, and concluded i
that no further requirerents would be giveo him. This
memorandum did not, however, say that contact would be :
terminated; in fact, it said they would continue to de- +
brief Brun whenever he returned from 4 trip to Haiti.
This memorandum was sent to Port-au-Prince (CHTPW-1347,
17 Sept 1969).

The Station replied| 11 oct 69)

1. Headquarters agrees with Station that the con-
tinwed contact between Subject of 201-357029 and IDEN A,
en behslf of FODISH, poses a potential security threat
for the LNEARP composests in Esiti. Upon receipt of
Ref C, the Desk sent a memorandum to Chief, WODISH, om
19 August 1963, whic! orwarced a resume of the Ref C
information, and requested tuat the contact betveen
IDEM A and Subject om behalf of WODISH be terminated.

2. On 7D August 1969, the FODISH officer who is in

was originally introduced to WODISH in Kew York City,”
by fabject on 15 April 1966. Until the early f2iI of
1967, much of WODISH activity with IDEN A was devoted
te arranging contacts with various elements of LNHARP,
which IDEN A requested on tehalf of Subject, and
Yeporting operational information. To the best of
VODISH knowledge and belief, however, none of these
contacts produced any tangible assistance to Subject's
varioas schenez. With two exceptions, WODISH
relationship with IDEN 4 since Octoter 1967 has been
exclusively that of foreign intelligence collection.
The exceptions were Subject'’s request for a secret
meeting with a WOLADY envoy in Hay 1969, and an
independent similar request from another group in

the same month. As has been fully reported, IDEH A
sade it perfectly clear to HODISH and to Subject

and to the other group that he was acting only as

a channel and that he was not actively involved or
interested. Ve (WODISH) sinply transmitted the
request. We wish to point out that what the Desk
calls IDEH's “Lottying” for Subject ended before
October 1967. During the nearly tvo years in

which the contact in the WODISH New York Office

hag dealt with IDEN A, the latter has never sponsored
or "lobbied" for Subject's various schemes. IDEN A
bas occasionally relayed information concersing then,
but bas told YODISH repeatedly that he no longer
wishes to be involved politically with Subject.

"e. We wish also to point out toat IDEN A, as a
regular supplier of foreign intelligence on Hoiti,
bas supplied data which originate with Haitians
other than Sobject, and, therefore, IDEN A is not
merely Sabject's mouthpiece. Specifically, IDEN B
end IDSE C sre two Gf IDSE 4's Esitinn sources.
37DS8 B is a well-known Haitian businessman; IDEN C
is a former deputy.

“g. We (WODISH) are not concerned with Subject,
bet are very much so rith IDEM 4. We do not believe
that IDEN A is involved in any current revolutionary
scheme im Haiti. We are, however, disturbed at the
unprofessiona! way in which IDEN A handled the questicas
concerning foreign companies in Haiti. We did not :
request IDEH 4 to consult Subject about the requirenents
em foreign cospanies and, in view of the manner in
which IDEW A handled our requirements, we shall
continue only to accept information which he proffers
on bis return froa his frequent trips to Haiti, and
shall refrain from briefing him. We have requested
car WOROMP customers to give us am evaluation of —
IDEN A's intelligence reporting. Unless this evaluation
ig unfavorable, we shall continue to exploit IDEN A
in the manner just descrited. Insofar as contact
teteween IDEN A and Subject is concerned, (1) we cannot
preveat IDEN.A from talking to Subject (or anybody
else), but (2) we have never in the past and shall
not im the future request that IDRM 4 contact Subject
on behalf of VODISH.”

3. Fo date, the VOROMP evaluation of IDEN A‘s
reporting bas not been received. However, since WODISH
has agreed to refrain from briefing IDEM A prior to any
future trips he asy anke to faiti, there should be no
eecurrence of the type of situation described in Ref C.

1. Headquarters agrees with Ststion that the cen-

19 August 1969, which forwarded a resune of the Bef C
information, and requested that the contact between
IDEH A and Subject on behalf of WODISH be terminated.

interested. We (WCDISH) simply transmitted the
request. We wish to point out that what the Desk
calls IDEN‘s “Lottyinz” for Sutject ended tefore
Gctoter 1967. During the nearly two gears in

Which the comta.t in the WODISH New York Office

bas dealt with IDEN A, the latter has never sponsored
or “lobbied™ for Sutject's varicus scheses. IDEN &
bag occasionally relayed information concerning them,
tat has told WODISH repeatedly that he no lonser
wishes to be involved politially with Sabject.

“ec. We wish als> to point out that IDEK A, asa
regular supplier of foreign intellizence on Haiti,
has supplied data which orizinate with ‘daitians
other than Subject, anc, therefore, IDEN A is not
merely Subject’s moutapiece. Specigicaiiy, ibe# B
and IDEN C are two of ID¥H A’s Haitian sources.

CEH B is a well-known dsitian businessman; IDEN C
is a former deputy. :

"é. Ye (SODISH} are not concerned with Subject,
isi tet are very such so with IDEN.A. We do not telieve
that IDEN A is involved in any current revolutionary
@chene in Haiti. We are, however, disturbed at the
umprofessiouz] way in which IDEN A handled the questions
comcernins foreign companies in Haiti. We did not
request IDEN A to consult Subject about the requiresents
oa foreign conpanies and, in view of the mpnaner in
which IDEN A handled our requirenents,.we shall
continue oaly to accept information which he proffers
om his return from his frequent trips to Baiti, and
shall refrain from triefing him. We have requested
cur VORONP customers to give us sn evaluation of
TREN A's intelligence reporting. Unless this evaluation
ig enfavorable, we aball contisue to exploit IDZH &
im the manner just descrited. Insofar as contact
Retween IDEN A and Subyect is concerned, (1) we cannot
Peevent IDEN A from talking to Subject (or anybody :
else), but (2) we hare never in the past and shall
Bot in the future request that IDEN A comtact Sabject:
o@ behalf af VODISE.~ ‘ :
3. To date, the WOROMP evaluation of IDEN A’s
Feportimg has not Leen received. However, since VODISH
bas agreed to refrain from triefing IDEN A prior to any
future trips he asy make to Haiti, there should te no
wecurrence of the type of situation described in Ref C.

: ‘sumgecr: DCS Relatiouship with Louis A.Braa
Ref: W/T Memoranda, 28 Mey 6, and 19 ing 69, emne mubject

1, We have carefully considered W/7's comments about
Louis A. Brun and his relationship with Clezard Joseph Charles. We
have concluded that in the matter of the nine questions concerning
the activity of foreicn cccpantes in Haiti Brun has been guilty at
lesst of sloppy security procedures and have decided to modify our
relationship with hin. :

2.. Charles has never coubted that Brun represented a
chennel to US goverment authority which he could use to suppiexest
his contacts with menbers of the US Enbassy staff in Port-eu-?rince.
Brun vis originally introduced to DCS in New York City by Charles on
15 Apr 1956 (see menorancm SY-251-66). Until the early fal of 1967,
mich of our activity vith Brun was devoted to arranging contacts vith
verious elenents of the US goverment, which Brun requested on desalf
of Charles, and reporting operesicnal inforzation. To the bes= cl
our knowledge and belief, however, none of these contacts produced any
tangible assistance to Charles's various schenes. With two excertions,
our relationship with Srun since Cetober 1967 has been exclusively that
of foreign intelligence coliecticn, The excepticns were Charles's
request for 8 secret seeting with a US exvoy in My 1969 and an i
dependent sinilar request from ascther group in the same month. As
has been fully reported, Brun nade it perfectly clear to us and to
Charies and to the other group that ne wes acting only as e czame!
end that he was not actively involved or interested. We sinaly crans-
mitted the requests. We wish to point out that vist WH/7 calis Brun's
cod "Lobbying” for Charles ended before October 1957. During the nearly

‘two years in vhich izchell bas dealt vith Brun, the latter bes rever

sponsored or “lobbied” for Charies's various sckenes. ie has
occasionally information concerning then, but has told us

repeatedly that be no longer wishes to be involved politically with

Charles.

3. We wish clso to point out that Brun, as a regular
supplier of foreign intelligence on Haiti, has supplied data which
originate with Haitians other than charles, and, therefore, thet
Brun is not merely Charles's mosthpiece. Specifically, Louis
Leveque and Alfonse Lahens are two of Brun’s Eaitien sources. Leveque
4s a vell-known Haitian businessman; Lahens is a former deputy.

4, We are not concerned with Charles, but are very mich
so with Brun. We do not believe that Brun is involved in any currest
Tevolutionary scheme in Haiti. We are, however, disturbed at the ca-
professional way in which Brun hendled the questions concerning foreign
companies in Haiti, We did not request Erun to consult Cherles about
the requirements on foreign companies and in view of the manner in waich
Brun handled ovr requirenents ve shall contime only to eccept informa~
tion which he proffers on his return fron his frequent trips to Haiti
aad shall refrain from briefing hin. We have requested our D3/I
consumers to give us an evaluation of Brun's intelligence reportin;.
Unless this evaluation is unfavorable, we shall continue to exploit
‘Brun in the manner just described. Insofar as contact between Brun
aad Charles is concerned, (a) we cannot prevent Brun fron talking to
Charles (or anybody else) but (b) ve have never in the past and shall
mot in the future request that Brun contact Charles on behalf of DCS.

Opponents of Haitian President Francois Duvalier have forned a new

Gérard Constant (Haitian Arny Chtef of

@nd 00-B-322/14525-69 (parsercph 3)_for earlier deta concerning
some of the nenbers of this group.,

This group is now working vith Clé=ard Joseph Charles and bas
formulated, largely under tke direction of the Invcer, a tentative
political plan for the orgacization of = post-Duvalier Haiti, The
group is anxious to act, because some of the necbers, notably Daniel
and Cayard, fear that they will be arrested in the not-too-distant
future. ‘The entire mocbership displays, however, the trait comen
to all Haitian opposition groups: they vill not act until President
Davalier dies, becomes tozally incapacitated or is overthrow: by

‘somebody else. Jacques is an inportans addition to.the group. He

ds completely loyal to President Duvalier, but has no use for the
other mecbers of the Duvalier family. Corsequeatly, he will play no
active part unless the President in some manner disappears from the
ecene.
This group still wishes to exercise pover during @ transitional

. Charles does not was: to hold any political

@ppointzent during this transition period, but plans to recover his
position as the head of the Haitian Cuaxher of Comerce and travel
abroad, to raise money for foreign eccconic assistance to Eaiti.

three political parties in the post-Duvalier period and is convinced
that TOP will win a constitutional victory at the polls and propel
hin to power. In the meantime, Colonel Keener Blain will be the head
of the provisional government. Blain bas no long-range political
ambitions. Charles and his colleagues plan & new constitution for
Haiti, which will provide for @ President and for a Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister will exercise the effective power. Charles expects
that TOP’s electoral victory will make hin, as TOP’s leader, Prime
Minister in the new constitutional government.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Domestic Contact Service

SUBJECT 2 DCB Case 47540 ~ Contact with
Louis A, Brun/Clemard Joseph Charles

1. On 29 July is60,[____—_—dadvined
that Cleaard Joseph Charles had passed 2 list of nine
questions concerning the Hzitiam econoay to an official
of the United States Embassy in Port au Prince. The list
of questions var written in English in staadard U.8.
Government format and, although sterile, appeared to be
Aistelligeace requirements. Charles told the Embassy
official that he had just finished a “big job" for the
Pentagon and implied that the list also came from the
Pentagon. The Embassy official suspected that Charles
had passed a copy of the list to the National Palace.

2. Oa 2 {uaust.a_renresentative-o? the WH/Haiti ——
Desk contacted!
Btiaii of DCS, and iearned that the|
had briefed Mr. Louis A. Brun and had orally
Rist of CIZL requirements to Brun concerning Haiti prior
to Haiti during the week of 21 July.
jpeculated that Srun had probably noted the

requirements oa paper and then had passed a copy
te Charles upon his arrival in Haiti.

3. Yor a number of years, the United States Govern=-
ment has been aware of the political ambitions of Chsrles
and his alleged plotting to overthrow the Duvalier regime.
In 1967, this rather open plotting led to his imprison=
ment for over one year. Also, since May 1963, Charles
has been trying to obtain support from the United States
Governzent for his plots but he has been consistently
rebuffed. Charles is not held in bigh esteem by U.8.

* officials and his motives are highly questionable. He.
eves his position in Haiti to his relationship with
~ Buvalier and his ability to successfully manage sone of

ml

Chaelitg ate

the more notorious financial rackets of the regime.

Charles enjoys no political folioving and even the "plois”
with wnich he is associated are viewed with considerable
veserve. For examole, we have never been able to confirm
that Charles was involved vith the "military junta” formed
in May 1969, as be claimed. In February 1969, the U.8.
Eebessy in Port su Prince commented that, with regard to
the most recent plotting of Cuarles, “the possibility
eannot be excluced that Charles....could be a provocation id

to detormine the real motives of the United States Govern— i t
went towarcs the Duvalier regine.” We concur in the :
Eabassy‘s views.

4. During the past three yeers, the WH Division has
been tept advised of the contact between DCS snd Brum and
hig relationship with Charles. Ve sre aleo avare from
DCB and ether sources of the efforts by Brun to obtain j
support from the United States Government for Charles. 2
Brun ig, of course, a close collaborator of Charles end q i
a business representative of his in New York City. Brun 4 H
has contacted officials of the Department of Defense, i
the Department of State, and even a person with access to i
Presicent Johnson on Charles‘ behalf. The Chief of ty
Caribbean Affairs of the Department of State cetegorically
told Brun in June 1967 that the United States Government
vas not interested in supporting the plots of Charles or
anyone else egainst Duvalier, but this advice seems to
have fallen on deaf ears. The most recent example of
Brun's lobbying wac in Hay 1969 when Brum passed om to
DCS a request from Charles for a secret meeting between
a U.S. envoy and » representative of the "military junta.”
Brun'’s involvement with Charles requires that he be con
sidered s biased source of information. While some of the i
information Brun has obtained from Charles bas been of H
interest, there is hardly anything that sas not available
through other channels and indeed, much of it was slanted.

5. As was set.forth in VH/7 memoranda to the
Cperatioaal Support Staff, DCS, on 16 July 1968 and
28 May 1969, we intorpose no objection to DCS saintaining
contact with Brun for ita ow dala reich the

: A. DIRECTOR 26288 dated 1 August 1969
B. HTPA-2443 dated 29 July 1969
ACTION REQUIRED: See Paragraph 5.

1. The Station would like to offer its views on
the WODISG contact, through Identicy ot Paragraph 1
Reference A (hereinarter IDEN), with 201-357029, as well
as ca the question of the requirezents which 201-357029
gave LNFURE and which were forwarded to Headquarters in
Reference B.

2. Since IDEN has been told that bis contact is with
LSSHOE and since he has told 201-357029 that fact, and since
201-357029 has apparently, in his sind at least,converted that
fact into contact with RVROCK, and has probably spread both
stories with his associates and thereby throughout the ?ocal
milieu, we have, in effect, a dangerous security situation.
When we consider that the LNFURE bapa bes all toe information

that 201-357029 gives ID=N anywa: snyways aad st ot the time receives .
the information directly from 2U. 2337029, then we have an
operation that is ditricult to justity.

3. In the case of the requirements forwarded with
Reference B, we have a situation in which WODISH levied
bbe ma taser on 201-357029, through IDEN. 201-357029

then turned those requirements over to LNPURE which returned
them via 201-357029 and IDEN to WCDISH. Why not cut out the
middleman and the security conplications, and save the headaches?

4 The Station teels that the ISH handling of 201-357029
results in a case that has the potential of causing
blens for AKULE, and that it could well be that AKULZ wilh
made to bear the blame since elements within RVROCK might
feel thet the ultimate responsibility tor supervision of the
case lies with AKULE.

gente on Charles im Haiti to service om behalf of DCS. The
solationship between Brun and Charles also has manifested
political and security aspects which could adversely affect

Accordingly, we request that the contact between Brun and
Clemard Joseph Charlies om behalf of DCS be terninated.

ATTEETION z

BIT 2 DCS Case 47540 - Request by Haitian
Cppositios Group for Secret Interview
with U.8. Official

e
1, his meworandus will cerve to confirm the telephose
conversations between your office and the Chief of tne Beith
Desk on 15 anc 27 May 1969 concerning the request nade
through Mr. Lovie A. Bran om the above subject. During these

‘conversations, your office was edvised thet the #2 Division

hag po interest in coatacting any representative or peaber
of the plotting group.

3. The WH Division considers Cleaard Joseph Charles
to be @ perennial anti-Duvalier plotter in Port au Prince
with little seers or following to carry out his epti-goverm~
ment designs. During the weex of 11] way 1960, Casries

Byproacbec tac Eabsessy is Port ss hes sith bestcelly the
sase information as relayed to the
ty Mr. Bran. Tse only difference va ba it

that 8 U.S. Government osficial make contact with tne ister
ee ee eeetea chen Seat eee le abe cori new ite: Remyraeee
thet the 0.8. Governeent vould look evolently om the group
once the coup vse launcoed. The cxbassy replied that the
U.8, Government bad # firm policy not to intervene in such

matters and that mo such assurance could bo expectec.

3. Since 1967, Charles has rel Similar overtures to
the U.S. Government for support anti-government plans.
Whea reviewing these approaches, there has always bees some
doubt as to the accuracy of the information that Charice
(or Brun) bee furnigned. Fhile it tas accepted that Cherles
wae actually plotting sgainst Duvalier, it could sever be
deterained if he wes actually a member of the plotting group,
which usually includec aembere of the Haitian Army, or if
Cuarlee had eleply become svare of an sati-Duvalier plot and
was trying to act as & troker between the plotters and the

Governaeant for his evn intereute.

4. At the presest time, fairly reliable reports have
been received that certain officisls of the Haitian arey
are trying to farm a jants to take power in the cvest Devalier
dies. Sono members oo tale juata are reportedly anxious ts
overthrow Duvalier, should I:3 recover, but wo far save aut
established  timetatle oz decided how they intend to carry
@ut the coup. Also, tar ilinese of Duvalier has undoubtedly
inspired scti-Dovelier plotting by other groups in Haiti
bet mo reliable inforcation im available oa their plage. I¢
ig interesting to note tnst Clesard Joseph Cuarles is not
idestified ag @ plotter iz sry of the reports from interns]
sources.

5. A vas mentioned in the VH/7 memoracdum ceted
16 July 1968, we do not isterpowe any objection to OCB
gaiatsining contact cits Brun for its own purposes. Hevever,
we ieel that im the interests of security and also in cos]
forrmnce vith 6.8, policy, that Bran should cleerly ander-
etaad (hat we seve bo interest ia establisting contact vith
any sexber ef the interne) group through his channel and i
8. Government bas no ipterest in becoming
ti-Davalier activities.

One reason for President Duvalier's dislike of Caarles (and coe |

‘The New York City manager of the Haitian Tourist Zureau, Jean
Sorel, 1s in Zaiti and is ecting in Foucard's steed. Razah
Theodore, Depsty Director of Tourisn, is amiable exd is a friend
Of Presidext Ouvalier. He is, however, of little stature and
{s not capabie of doing anything more then the roucine daily
chores of the office. Foucard cannot afford to call attention
to hinself, because he is fearful for the physical safevy of
his sister, Yedane Saint-victor. President Davalier recently
@iswissed her as nis persc.w secretary and rezleced her with
his daughter, wife of Colonel tax Dominique. Since then, rumor
have abounded teat Yadene SainteVictor ray be arsed for physi-
cal Liquidation /Collector's Note: see reference./. Whether
or not these ==wra have esy foundation in fact, Tiere is no
doubt that the members of the Foucard fanily (1 e, Luc-Albert,
