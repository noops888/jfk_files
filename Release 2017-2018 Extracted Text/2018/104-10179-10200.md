1. I acbeduled this mecting for the sole purpose of continuing

my quler development of Subject begun in November 1963. The enter

prise was undertaken on a non-specific baals juat to keep in touch with

Subject because of blo relatively pre-eminent position in the exile

community. Before the Instant weeting I had had brief discussiona

with bolken and Anderson, obtaininy thoir concurrence with aiy idea

that Subject could someday be a valuable source of insighta into the

eratione level of Cl! had actually intended at this meeting

oncentrate on subject's function in the but found that th

diocusnion directed deself almost exclusively to the affairs of AMBANG-I.

Thin face was the direct and accldental result of my opening gambit to

the effect of 'i'bat's new?" in answer to which Subjeck complained that

since our last meetlag in January, Latin America seemed to be on tbe

way to holl in a handcart and about the only two people who seemed to

be doing anything about it wore AMBANG and former Venenuelan

president Balancourt. I ahan't attempt to reproduce the too boure of

feneral conversation but do feel that the Importance of AMBANG

coupled with the nature of Subjoct's views on him warrant a statement

of what these views are.

2. Subject has known AMBANG for several years and has

admired him through all the varioun seasons of their relationab.p.

Subject was first Impressed wich AMBANG'» organisine talente at the

time AMBANO look over responsibility for organizing the anti- Batiota

Havana underground from Faultino l'eres.

AMBANG-l'a talento as so

engineer, according to Subject, have Impressed nearly everyone who is

demonatrable engineering skill are apparently wedded to a firiu.

judiclous personality with the senull thas AMMAiC, is an effective and

appealing person lo Cutan exles of various stripe. Througtout the

eveniny Subject reitorated tio conviction that of ail exile leadere who

kare emerged since the fake-over of Cuba by Castro, AA: BANG alone

has the ability and llo profile to pur lugetter and lead a succesíul

resintance enterpriae.

3.

Subject streased repeatedly his conviction tist whoever le to

attempt to cause a serious crach in the ever-thierenin; ring of defenses

on the deland must have the kind of name which will conjure à positive

Image in the imagination of the average Cuban.

This person must mean

something, not only interme of past affiliatione and present malitary

strength but in terma of the immediate and not no inimediate futuro, to"

those persons who, though not committed to the Castro revolution, have

either benefitted alightly or are bo und to ll by virtue of their juos.

subject in certain these persons would not consider AMBANi lo be a

menace.

Subject claimed that he is not working with or for AWBANG

mad asserted that he had not conversed ol corresponded with him for

over half a year.

If indeed Subject was leading me on, attempting to

sell AMBANG to me. he did so with a subtlety to which I am definitoly

not accustomed.

He expressed os more than one occasion & fear that

AMBANG might, In his real to get something moving, cominit himaelf

Do such a tight timing lhas he would be forced to undertate action at a

momeat which was acually disadvantageous to limbell. He stressed

that even AMBANG's capital on the island is limited and that whatever

movement la made to cash la on thie capital must be calculated to have

Rhe greatest poonible effect.
