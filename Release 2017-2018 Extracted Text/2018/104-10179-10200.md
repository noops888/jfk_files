1, 1 scheduled this meeting for the sole purpoee of coatinuing
my quiet development of Subject begun in November 1963, The enter+
prise wae undertaken on a non-specific basis just to keep in touch with
Subject because of bie relatively pre-eminent position in the exile
community. Before the instant meeting I had had brief discussions
with Lolten and Anderson, obtaining their concurrence with my idea
that Subject could someday be a valuable source of insights into the
operations level of 2\I had actually intended at this meeting to
concentrate on Subjects function in the| ut found that the
discussion directed itself almost eaclusively to the affairs of AMBANG-1.
This fact wae the direct and accidental reault of my opening gambit to
the effect of ' What's new?" in answer to which Subject complained that
since our last meeting in January, Latin America seemed to be on the
way to hell in a handcart and about the only two people who seemed to
be doing anything about it wore AMBANG and former Veneauelan
president Betancourt. I shan't attempt to reproduce the two hours of
fpneral conversation but do fee) that the importance of AMBANG
coupled with the nature of Subject's views on him warrant a statement

of what these views ar

2. Subject hae known AMBANG for several years and has
admired him through all the various seasona of their.relationsh!p.
Subject wae first impressed with AMBANG's organining talents at the
time AMBANG took over responsibility for organizing the anti-Batista
Havana underground from Faustino Peres. AMBANG-1's talents as an
engineer, according to Subject, have impressed nearly averyone who is

aware of them, These two factors, the organixing talent ana the
demonstrable engineering ekill are apparently wedded to a firm,
judicious personality with the result that AMNANG is an effective and
appealing pereon to Cutan exiles of various stripe. Throughout the
evening Subject reiterated his conviction that of ail exile leaders who

have emorged since the take-over of Cuba by Caetro, AMBA
bap the ability and the profile to put together and Sead a suc:
resistance enterpriee,

3. Subject stressed repeatedly his conviction that whoever is to
attempt to cause @ serious crack in the ever-thicrening ring of defenses
oa the island must have the kind of name which will conjure a positive
image in the imagination of the average Cuban. This person must mean
something not only interms of past affiliations and present mulitary
strength but in terme of the immediate and not so immediate future, to‚Äù
those persons who, though not committed to the Castro revolution, have
either benefitted elightly or are bound to it by virtue of their jobs.
Subject ie certain these persons would not consider AMBANG to be a

menace.

4, Subject claimed that be is not working with or for AMBANG
and asserted that he had not conversed or correrponded with him for
over half a year. If indeed Subject wag leading me on, attempting to
ell AMBANG to me, he did 80 with a subtlety to which I am definitely
not accustomed. He expressed oa more than one occasion a fear that
AMBANG might, in his zeal to get something moving, commit himeelf
to such #tight timing that he would be forced to undertake action at a :
moment which was actually disadvantageous to Limself. He stressed
that even AMBANG's capital on the island is limited and that whate
movement is made to cash in on this capital must be calculated to have i
the greatest poasibie effect.
