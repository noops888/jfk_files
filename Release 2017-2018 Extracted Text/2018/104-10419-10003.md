Freedom of Information Coordinator

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D.C. 20505

Dear Sir:

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act as

amended (5 U.S.C. 552)•

I write to request a copy of the CIA letter to the Rocke-

feller Commission dated June 7, 1975.

To avoid any possible misunderstanding of what 1s being

requested, I make reference to the Final Report of the Select

Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to

Intelligence Activities, Book V. The Government Printing Of-

fice date of publication is April 23, 1976. The reference to

the note is made on page 5%, footnote 65. My request includes

any and all attachments of this letter as transmitted to the

Rockefeller Commission by your organization.

As you know, the amended act provides that if some parts

of a file are exempt from release that "reasonably segregable"

portions shall be provided. I therefore request that, if you

determine that some portions of the requested document are

exempt, you provide me Immediately with a copy of the remain-

der of the letter. I, of course, reserve my right to appeal

any such decisions.

If you determine that some or all of the letter is exempt

from release, I would appreciate your advising me as to which

exemptions or exemption you believe covers the material which

you are not releasing.

My organization is prepared to pay reasonable costs for

locating the requested document and reproducing it.

As you know, the amended act permits you to waive or reduce

the fees If that

"Is in the publie interest because furnishing

the information

can be considered as primarily benefiting the

public." I believe that this request plainly fits that category

and ask that you waive any fees.

If you have any questions regarding this FOIA request, please

telephone me at the above number.

As provided for in the amended act, I will expect to receive

a reply within ten

(10) working days.
