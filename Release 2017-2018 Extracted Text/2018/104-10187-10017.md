An increase in the hours of both the photogrephie ard physical curvotliance
coverage provided froa the new base by the LILYRIC operators (CO¢o-1600

hours) during the weekdays and to have the LISTED base provide

Photographic and physical surveillance covereze froa 1666-1030 hours
0a weekdays end froa.0920-13C9 hours on.weekends. Tnese changes were

dictated by the following considerations:

1. The'new LIMCUSIE building offers a auch better vantage point

for both photosraphic and phyatenl, surveillance then docs the
present. coaplex which houses the LILYAIC and LIMITED bases,
Tnerefore, the Station felt that the; personnel occupying thio

new base should-be those. posaessins the highest tecrnical skills

end also those able to provide the cost thorough end coaplete
coverages Since the LIMITED base now has only one trained

operator while the LILYRIC basehouse has three, the LILYUC croup

and a revision of working hours was indicated.

"2, Decause it Was apparent. that the coverage of the LEERICK

Aingtallation would be a lonz-rense end’ continuing requiresent,

tae Station desired to nteff the new bese with personacl of long- ©

rangé potential, LIS@TY-6, now alaost 60 years old, does not
possess this potential; hovever, the LILYRIC agent complex
happily coabines experienced ‘personzel with youthful agents.

3.° Firally, ‘the social and finsnetal status of the LILYAIC
personnel i5.ruch sore compatible jaxd consistent with the en-
vironzert of the new building thaa is: that of the LEGTSD fecily.
