. I. The same usually reliable source,

In a 6 September 1969 report, added the

following Information concerning MORO:

MORO is a very hard worker and works with precision and accuracy.

Politically he is a secure CASTRO supporter, but with intelligence and

moderation. He is serious, perhaps excessively reserted, but does not

lack communication or the capacity to inspire sympathy from both hie

colleagues at the Embassy and the Italian's with whom he comes in contact.

He never speaks of his family.

His commercial work at the Embassy

follows the normal office routine without any particular security treatment.

His hiring of technical personnel is considered extremely classified and he

refers these matters directly to the ambassador; no one else is authorized

to have contact with candidates for work in his area. MORO does not use

an automobile with Corps Diplomatic tags, probably for security reasons,

but instead drives a Renault R-8 with temporary license tags which are

valid for one year.

4.

In a report dated 17 January 1984 this same source said that Roberto MORO

Perez and Odina ROJAS Trete, both second secretaries at the Cuban Embassy

In Rome, have been lovers for sometime and live together at Via Cuboni 16

while MORO pretends to reside in an apartment on Via Archimede.
