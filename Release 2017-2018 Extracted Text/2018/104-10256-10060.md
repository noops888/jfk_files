Friends of Abaco, on 10 June 1974 sponsored a resolution
in behalf of the Abaco Independence Movement on the floor
of the British House of Lords, following conversations
with WERBELL in Washington in late May.

5. Despite the seeming innocence of. the enterprise,
however, we have observed that WERBELL, in particular, °
has made a concerted effort to involve persons fornerly
affiliated with this Agency in the activities of the
Friends of Abaco in support of Abaco's independence.

On several occasions, involving at least two former
officers of this organization, MULDOON and cited
above, WERBELL has introduced them as pres tive
Agency officials in such a fashion as to imply, according
to the persons involved, that either this Agency or the
United States Government supports the aims of -the

Friends of Abaco.

6. Most recently, WERBELL has proposed to both
retired officers in separate conversations that they
conduct a study, involving a visit to Abaco, to determine
the feasibility of Abaco's independence in political and
economic terms. The study would include interviews with
citizens on Abaco prior to an alleged “plebiscite on
independence to take place in Abaco on 28 June 1974.

To be included in the investigation is research on the
probable reaction in the United Nations Organization to

a petition from political groups in Abaco for support on
independence, notably any parallels to be found in :
precedents such as the Biafra secession from-Nigeria. —~~

7. Andrew ST. GEORGE, a nationally known free-lance
writer, has become active in WERBELL's organization. and
claims to be preparing an article on WERBELL and the
Abaco movenent for publication in True Magazine. .
ST. GEORGE has participated in the several meetings that
WERBELL, OLIVER and their associates have had with the

ee officers, Mr. John MULDOON



8. I of the collaboration of either
MULDOON or WERBELL- and OLIVER have hired
Walter Joseph + M, a former Agency friend of both
MULDOON and ROUSSOS.

8. John MULDOON is currently employed as the

Washington representative of the firm rity Consultants
