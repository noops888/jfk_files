Mitchell Livingston WERBELL III, the principal

owner of the arms manufacturing firm Defense Systens

International and an international arms dealer, has been

encouraging a group of Bahanian citizens on the island

of Abaco who seel: to secede from the Bahamian Commonwealth.

In this affair WERDELL has been collaborating with a

group based in Miami called the "Friends of Abaco."

Active. in the Friends of Abaco is Michael OLIVER, a wealthy

land developer residing at 2089 El Rancho Drive,

Carson City,

Nevada.

OLIVER, a naturalized U. S. Citizen, was born

Moses OLITSKI on 1l December 1928 in Lithuania.

4. In encouraging persons in Abaco to seek

independence of Nassau, OLIVER's apparent motive is to

establish a prototype governnert based on principles of

free enterprise expounded in a paperback book which he

has authored called "A New Constitution for a New Country"

(Fine Arts Press, Reno, Nev. - 1968) •

HERBELL, on the

other hand, has privately expressed a desire to establish

a tourist mecca on Abaco to include hotels, recreation

facilities and gambling casinos.

Officials of Holiday

International,

a Baltinore firm specialized in recreation

and health spas, have been briefed by WERBELL and OLIVER

recently on the Abaco movement.

Friends of Abaco, on 10 June 1974 sponsored a resolution

in behalf of the Abaco Independence Hovenent on the floor

of the British House of Lords, following conversations

with WERBELL in Washington in

late Hay.

5. Despite the seening innocence of.

the enterprise,

however, we have observed that WERBELL, in particular, '

has made a concerted effort to involve

persons formerly

affiliated with this Agency in the activities of the

Friends of Abaco in support of Abaco's independence.

On several occasions, involving at least to former

officers of this organization, MULDOON and

cited

above, WERBELL has introduced

them as presumably active

Agency officials in such a fashion as to imply,

according

to the persons involved, that either this Agency or the

United States Government supports the ains of the

Friends of Abaco.

6. Nost recently, WERBELL has proposed to both

retired officers in separate conversations that they

conduct a study, involving a visit to Abaco, to determine

the feasibility of Abaco's independence in political and

economic terms.

The study would include interviews with

citizens on Abaco prior to an alleged "plebiscite" on

independence to take place in Abaco on 28 June 1974.

To be included

in the investigation is rescarch on the

probable reaction in the United Nations Organization to

a petition from political groups in Abaco for support on

independence, notably any parallels to be found in

precedents such as the Biafra secession from Nigeria.

1. Andrew ST. GEORGE, a nationally known fice-lance

writer, has becone active in WERBELL'S

organization and

claims to be preparing an article on HERBELL and the

Abaco movement for publication in true Magazine.

SI. GEORGE has participated in the several meetings that

HERBELL, OLIVER and their associates have had with

• the

two retired AGenCy offiCers, Mr. John MULDOON
