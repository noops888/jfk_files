FROM SAC, Philadelphia (92-1027 Sub D)
SUBJECT:

LA COSA NOSTRA;

JUNE

Re Bureau letter dated 2/17/65, requesting
Philadelphia to forward specific examples
of information furnished by PH 705-C* to
provide basis for justifteation of con-
tinuance of this source fora 60 day period,

It should be noted that PH 705-C* furnishes
information in regard to PH 672-C-TE, a known member of: ~

La Cosa Nostra. PH 705-C* during the pertinent period
has failed to furnish any specific information of value.
It-is not felt, however, that this source should be

discontinued,

The source during the pertinent period was
visited by La Cosa Nostra member FRANK MONTE on two.
occasions. MONTE was out of range of PH 705-C* when con-
‘versing with. the occupant of this location; however, the
source servéd as a means to verify that PH 672-C-TE did not

shield the fact that MONTE visited him and propositioned

source to accompany him on a proposed holdup,

This holdup

was not undertaken, The proposition was made by MONTE.

PH 672-C-TE improves his financial status
monthly, and it is felt that he will, therefore, be con-
tacted socially more frequently, and since he is a member
of La Cosa Nostra and has potential to furnish valuable
information, Philadelphia will continue PH 705-C*, UACB,

for an additional 60 days.
