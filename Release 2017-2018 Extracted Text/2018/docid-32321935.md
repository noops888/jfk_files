Details: (U) On 2/14/1997, the ARRB formally advised the FBI of
the determinations voted by them on FBI documents at a meeting
held 1/29-30/1997. The ARRB letter listed 83 documents for which
the ARRB made determinations. The FBI does not have any appeal
issues with the release of the materials. However, the release
of the information in these documents will reveal the identities
of individuals whom the documents described as potential criminal
informants (PCI), confidential informants (CI), potential
security informants (PSI), security informants (SI), racial
informants (RS) and sources of information (SOI). The ARRB

decisions will also release what was previously classified
foreign counterintelligence information.

(U) The documents concerning the decisions from the last
meeting, are listed below by document number with the information
to be released. The status of informants and sources, if found
through research, is noted after the name with living (L),
deceased (D), no record (NR), or date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy) .

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting
the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular
information, and classified information related to sources and
foreign relations as listed above. However, the ARRB supports
the position that the information ordered disclosed is relevant
and significant to the assassination. They ,opine the pertinence
and importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to
the individuals or the FBI's/United States Government's foreign
relations, informants or operational aspects.

(U) The JFKTF will continue to advise CID, NSD and OGC of
the ARRB decisions. However, due to the narrowed scope of appeal
issues, NSD and CID recommendations will only be sought for
significant matters, none of which are documented in this
memorandum. If you have questions, please contact Karen S.
Robertson at extension 9587, Carol L. Keeley at extension 9494,
or Carl Valentine at extension 9476.
