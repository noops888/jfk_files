MENORANDUM FOR: C/LA/CAM

FROM:

C/LAD

In

a meeting with Assistant Secretary Rogers today,

he told me that he had learned from Foreign Minister Facio

that Bosch, at the time of his arrest in San Jose during the

Kissinger

visit, had two recently issued passports from the

current Chilean government.

Facio also said that 10 to 12.

persons also had come into Costa Rica with Baseh but the

Costa Ricans do not know who they are nor have they been

able to locate them.

I mentioned to Rogers that a U.S.

Secret Service agent had interviewed Bosch®

2 In view of State's interest in this case,

I suggest

try to tind

out

the number

of these Chilean passports and to whom they were issued.

Also it might be worthwhile to have a summary of what Bosch

and the .U.S. Secret Service agent talked about.
