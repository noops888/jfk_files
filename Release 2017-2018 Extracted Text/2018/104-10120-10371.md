5. There is attached a copy of a memorandum from the Chief,
Assessment and Evaluation Staff dated 9 March 1961, which requests
alias CIA, credentials for this purpose for two psychologists

has been processed by the Cover Support Desk and the Physical
Security Division (Badge Office) and CIA alias credentials are
currently being prepared. They will be issued directly to the

reflecting Agency employment for the two psychologists concerned.
They will be placed under domestic cover by CCG as a further
precauticn.
