FROM: ELLIOT MAXWELL, BILL BADER . SS
e

DATE: APRIL 10, 1975 eS

SUBJECT: VISIT TO THE CIA AGENCY, LANGLEY S
APRIL 10, 1975 SS

Bill Bader and Elliot Maxwell were at the Central
Intelligence Agency from roughly 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m.
on April 10, 1975. While there we met with John Clarke,
Harriet Mowitt, Lyle Miller of the Office of the General
Counsel, and Lewis Elder, historian for the CIA.

We reviewed with Lewis Elder a List of historical
studies now in his custody. Attached is a list of the
historical studies and other materials which we requested
pursuant to our agreement with John Clarke that requests
made while at the Agency would be treated as formal requests
of the Committee.

It did not seem profitable to ask that the Agency provide
all of the historical studies which were listed. We chose
works because they dealt with either an overview of the
Agency, or a particular Directorate, or they provided inform-
ation about policies and practices with which the Committee
may be concerned. Some reliance was placed on Mr. Elder's
suggestions as to the quality of the work and the value of the
information which it provided. Elder cautioned us to be
somewhat sceptical about a number of the studies, as the

ranged from professional historians to station chiefs,

quality yaried from very good to awful. We reserved

yj che
aig right to ask for other studies later. These include the H

hors

growing * cS

A 17-volume history of the Office of Special Activities, i

1-
(the U-2 project).
2. A study of personnel records and reports.
* 3. A study of security programs of the CIA: the Domestic
Field Office.
4. <A study of Western European operations directed against

Cuba.
5. A history of Cuban refugee exploitation.

It is not clear how soon we will receive the material, or

if we will receive it at all. Elder suggested that there were

pstantial third-agency questions involved; for instance, the

study of the U-2 would require approval from numerous govern-
ment agencies as well as seventeen foreign governments.

Elliot also met with Lyle Miller of the General Counsel's
staff about the material provided in response to the Committee's

request for comments on proposed legislation. The material

provided included comments on legislation proposed in.1974,
plus a ‘comment on PL 90-331, which allows the Director of the

Secret Service to request support from other agencies of the

Government. Elliot indicated to Mr. Miller that the lack of

material on other legislation in other years was unacceptable.



FILES

The following files are requested. In order to expedite
their location, the Committee has indicated offices which
appear to be the best starting point for a search. This does
not limit, nor supersede the general guideline that all files
throughout the CIA relating to a project be procured. If pro-
jects herein identified are not CIA projects, but are identi-
fiable as projects of other agencies with which CIA had some
connection, the request-is for all CIA files regarding such
projects.

In the first instance, all of the specified material will
be reviewed in unsanitized form by staff at CIA headquarters.
The Committee will continue to select particular documents to
be transmitted to the Committee's offices in Washington to be

used in preparing for hearings and the Committee's report.

I. All files regarding the following projects, incicents or

entities:

purposes [FE])
