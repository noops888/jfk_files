I. On 15 September 1960, 3 staff employees (David Christ, Thornton."

Anderson and Walter Szuminakl) were arrested by the Cuban C-2 while in-

stalling audio surveillance equipment against the New China Newa Agency

In Havant: About the same tine an Agoney case officer, Robertie picked

a stay-behind agent and his wife, Mr. and Mrs.

up. All six were jailed.

Subsequently, Mrs

and Neet were released

and deported.

06.

2. The 3 staff employees were operating under alias Identities which

have stood up to date (Daniel Carawell, Eustace Danbrunt, Edmund Taransky).

The staff employees and the stay-behind agent were tried on 17 December

1960. On 10 January 1961, the staff employees were sentenced to 10 years

in jail, and the stay-behind agent was ordered deported. The deportation

took place shortly thereafter:

3. Following the arrest, the 3 Agency employees were firat detalned

at the G-2 headquartera in Havana and shortly thereafter were moved to

the LaCabana prison. It was possible to keep them supplied with food, ne-

ceseities, radios, reading material, etc. On 23 January ln spite of the

immediate appeal of the sentence filed by their lawyer, the 3 men were

moved to the Isle of Pines where living and sanitary conditiona are in-

tolerable.. Prisoners are required to perform hard manual labor, and

there la an insutficiency of food.

4. With the asslotance of Mr. Hugh Kessler, a U.S. consular 0f-

ficial, close contact was kept with the 3 men until diplomatic relations

with Cuba were severed. Through a Washington attorney, James R.

Murphy, arrangementa were made with a Cuban lawyer, Dr. Fernando

Colomar, to represent the 3 men in court. Colomar was not told of

any Agency interest in the operation. Through the jolnt services of

Mesars. Kessler and Colomar, the 3 men were supplied with pocket

money, food, clothing, toilet articles, etc. After diplomatic relationg

were severed, Colomar continued to visit the men until they were trans

ferred to the Isle of Pines.

The 3 men have been held in the Modelo Prisos, Nueva Gerona.

Isle of Pines since January 1961. We have been successful in getting money

and supplies to them through the Washington Attorney to the Swiss Embassy

in Havana..

Their last corres

portage AT wy hey a tate lot out at by lete are Tell torren

reasonably good bealth. The Swiss are attempting to verify a report that

3 Americans were transferred to the Boniato Prison in early November 1962.

6. It has been necessary in this case to conceal Government interest

in the 3 prisoners in order to avoid their execution and/or full debriefing on

the sensitive Information they possess.

7. The Washlagton Attorney has obtained associate counsel in Mexico

City and in Chicago, Illnola. The Chicago Attorney, who ls unwitting of

Government Interest, (Constantine N. Kangles) visited Havana in May/June

1962 and as of November 22, 1962 recelved word that an soon as possible

he will be lnvited back to Cuba to negotiate with Fidel Caatro on this case.

Kangles expects the releage of the 3 men not later than the firat week in

January 1963.

8. Other operational efforte to secure the release of the men are in

progreas. We have avolded keeping Mrs. Christ fully briefed on the spe-

cliles of the efforts being made, as she tenda to be critical of the Agency

and of the fact that she la unaware of any significant interest in the case la -

the Executive Branch of the Government. She has prevlously seen Mesars.

Allen Dulles, General Cabell, General Maxwell Taylor, and General Carter.

Mi. James Donovan, who has appeared in connection with negotia-

tions for the Playa Giron prisoners, has been made aware of the 22 Ameri

cans held la Cuba and of the Agency Interest in 3 of those prisoners. He

has not been told their true names.

10. David Christ's wife, Wilms, and their als children live in the

Washington area where they have been frequently visited by members of

the Agency. She has explained to neighbors that her husband in away on a

long TDY for the Government which has become a permanent assignment

and that in line with the new regulations on overseas travel of dependents,

she has not been allowed to follow him.. Wilma Christ has been paid her
