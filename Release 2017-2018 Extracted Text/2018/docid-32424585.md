It might prove necessary to spend

additional

money abroad on such itens as breeding

1tens (eg. steel piping and electric cable).

These nay cost 210 million.

CONCLUSION TWO

On the home front both the period and degree of

austerity,

both as regards lood

and consumer goods,

increased.

General construction work will be held back.

GENERAI, CONCLUSION•

1.0

Compared to 1963 drop in expori eamings plus additional

imports caused by Flora, will amount to around 610 - 615 million.

But 1963 totals were low and another 240 million should

probably be added to

this total to compare 1t with what was

probably hoped

for.

There will be nothing to spare abroad to alleviate

the further lowering of the standard of living at home.

prisons in Cuba.

b) Mr. Byatt's 1011/63 of August 15 enclosing
