I would like, because of the special expertise of this

word or two about the process that we are engaged in.

First, we commend you for your long years of service
to a very, very important agency of this government, I:
personally was peers of that in a very, very small way in

the Navy a long time ago, and I commend you for your dedica-

tion and your experience and what has come to be your reputa~ |

they have referred to you.as sort of the touchstone, or the

' person who was the expert among the experts,

I want to say also that I personally want to commend
our Chief Counsel, Professor Blakey, and our assistant
counsels for their long and dilligent.effort to build a
relationship with the agencies which is now beginning to be
extremely productive and fruitful in our whole process of
trying to get all the information and to lay the matter of
the assassination of the President of the United States to”
rest permanently with the complete story.

I just wanted you to know that we have. been working

with the CIA and the FBI and they have been very cooperative

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicatéd that you were not
involved in the. actual decision-making process. Were you
privy to the actual decision-making process?

Ms. Goodpasture,. It depended upon what it concerned.
If it was a project that I worked on, I participated in it,

but if it were a station activity, I did not.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did yow work at the station in Mexico

Ms. Goodpasture, Yes,

Mr, Goldsmith. Would you give the Congressional panel
an evaluation of Winn Scott's competence as the Chief of
Station?

Ms. Goodpasture, Well, I think that he was a very
conscientious man, he was a hardworking man, he expected
everyone else to do their work, he worked long hours. Some
people felt, or expressed the opinion, in my presence, that
he was a hard. worker and expected too much from employees,
but I do not think that that was really the case, He was
a very conscientious man, an intelligent man, He obviously
had the intelligence for the post, or he would not have been

assigned there,

Mr. Goldsmith. Is the Mexico City station one of the
largest CIA stations in operation?

Ms, Goodpasture, At the present time, I do not know,

Mr. Goldsmith. What kind of attitude did Mr. Scott
have towards the importance of files and recordkeeping systems

at the Mexico City station?

(202) S5-2945
o

Ms, Goodpasture. He was very conscientious. ‘He wanted

them maintained accurately and completely.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long were the files that he main-

tained preserved?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I am not too sure about that.

They were there up until the time that I left, but I think

that there was a reduction because of space in 1969. ‘The

files were cut back, but I do not have firsthand knowledge

of that because I did not participate’ init. !

REP

Mr. Goldsmith. During the time that you were in Mexico i

Sah

City with Mr. Scott, to your knowledge was anything ever

| Ms, Goodpasture. Well, several things were destroyed
i

that were not considered of any value as far as the work at

g $ i Mr. Goldsmith, It has been said of Mr, Scott that
7 7 \ during his tenure in Mexico City not even a shred of paper |
: 3 i was thrown out or moved from the Mexico City station files,
7 | Would you say that is an accurate statement? |
: Ms. Goodpasture. Some of the rough paper was thrown

H out, the rough paper that he considered supporting data for a

dispatch that he had written or a cable that he sent, he kept,
| He insisted that other people do the same thing.

Mr. Goldsmith, Fine.

At this time, I am going to get into the area of the

suryeillance operations in Mexico City,

Suu,

Miss Goodpasture, what kinds of surveillance operations

i) did the CIT have in Mexico City in 1963 with respect to the

ly | Soviet and Cuban consulate and embassies?

300 7TH STREET,

suryeillance project with regard to the Soviet and Cuban

embassies and consuls?

Ms. Goodpasture. My understanding of that was that it

i
13 i was to be used to identify those people who might be working
ie
i
{

for the Soviets as espionage agents who were U.S. citizens H
|

1s | who went down there driving a car with a U.S. license plate

on it, or people we did not know but could identify.

The same procedure was also used for trying to identify

people other than U.S. citizens, but it was concentrated in i

the beginning on license plates or numbers, or sométhing that

300 7TH STREET,

could be identified,

Mr. Goldsmith. An attempt would be made to take pic

tures of both the car, license plates and the occupants of

é J i I screened and looked at thé photographs because I had \

Ny

photograph bases were first set.up, were first used. I had

an interest in them, or looked at them to see that they were
in focus, that the negatives were all printed, and Mr.

Scott. asked me to do that because I had been a commercial. - H

photographer before I. went to work for.the government, |

Mx..Goldsmith, Are you saying, in 1963, your roll

with regard to the photograpliic surveillance at the Soviet

Ms, Goodpasture, Their technical quality.

|

Mr. Goldsmith, Not for the purpose of obtaining subse~ i

quent information from the photographs?

Ms. Goodpasture, No, because, at that. time, by 1963

Soviet matters and it was. their function to. investigate the

So all the raw material went. to them. I usually took

ew

a quick look at the photographs when they came in, and if

I noticed anything significant about them, I mentioned it to

the Soviet case officer, but he gave the formal reporting on |

How many cameras were in operation with regard to the

in that way, but I never had the responsibility for them

Mr. Goldsmith. As a practical matter, you were acting
in an informal supervising capacity?

Ms. Goodpasture, It could have been interpreted that
way by some of the people, because they would come to me and
bring me photographs and say, what do you think of this, do
you think that this is a hatin, or do you think he has ever
been ta the Soviet Embassy. before,

Mr, Goldsmith, In your own opinion do you think you
were acting, at least informally, in a supervisory capacity
with regards to this project?

Ms, Goodpasture, No,

Mr. Goldsmith. At this time, I would like for the
witness to be given Stack C of the documents that have been

Mr, Goldsmith. The seconé word --

Ms, Goodpasture. Page two?

Mr. Goldsmith. Page two. There appears a word "the

Mr, Goldsmith, Understood.

What is a releasing officer? What are his responsibil- |

Ms. Goodpasture. The supervisor, the person who decides
that the message should be sent; generally the releasing offi-~

i- person who will assume responsibility for the message after

it has been transmitted.

Mr. Goldsaith. The message would go --

Ms. Goodpasture, For instance, in an Embassy, if a
document goes to the communications. center signed by someone
who is not thé senior person in the section, they will not

send it; just everybody cannot take a message to the message

Mr,Fithian, Would the counsel permit a question?

ie

Mr,@Goldsmith, Yes, sir.

Mr, Fithian, In our Navy communications sytem, we
sometimes distinguished between an authenticating officer as |

’ one who not only authorized the sending of the cable, but

authenticated or. verified or vouched for, the. content.
Is that similar? H
Ms. Goodpasture, That would be the literal interpre-
tation of thé word. Whether ornot it was used in air traffic:
all the time or not, I do not. Know.
My guess. would be that that is correct.
Mr. Fithian. Do you know whether, in CIA traffic, |

: officer for a single message? i

hours, :

Ms. Goodpasture. We are talking about two different
things. here : The surveillance, someone was.available there,
but they did not make pictures, They may have been watching
the activity from 9:00 o'clock in the morning until 1:00
o'clock. and may have only made two pictures, one at 11:00
and-one at 12:00,

As far as photographic surveillance being continuous,
that would be really inaccurate because it was not a camera
making a picture of every minutets activity.

Mr, Goldsmith, However, there were personnel stationed
at positions outside the Soviet Embassy compound who had
photographic equipment available and who could take. pictures
at any time during daylight hours, is that correct?

Ms, Goodpasture. I do not. know whether it would be or
not, At any time. during daylight hours?

Mr. Goldsmith, I am drawing your attention to the
second paragraph of this document, page 1, the very first
sentence of that.paragraph. It says the photographic

coverage of the mentioned installations is of a continuous

| nature during daylight hours. Is that an accurate statement?

Mr, Goldsmith. Would you give the panel your evaluation

of the éfficiency of the photosurveillance operation?
Ms. Goodpasture, Well, I think that it generally was |

i very: good as far as the coverage was concerned, . re we asked |
|) them.to. get a photograph of the events that occurred between
9:00 and 10:00 on such and such a date, they usually produced
$.| the photographs for that period, !
Mr. Goldsmith. What if they were not specifically asked |
to focus on a person, as a matter of routine? How thorough

| was; the coyerage?

Ms, Goodpasture. They covered the categories that we

*, asked them for on a routine basis, which was to identify any

i people who appeared to be non-Latin and any Soviets. i
Mr, Goldsmith, I understand that was the purpose.

Given. that purpose, how thorough. was the coverage?

i Ms, Goodpasture, I think it was accurate.

Mr. Goldsmith, Was Winn Scott satisfied with the
performance of the photo. operation at the Soviet Embassy?

Ms, Goodpasture, To the best of my knowledge he was.

Mr. Goldsmith; I would now like you to refer to page
20 of the document that you have before you in Stack A-3.
Seven lines from the bottom in thesmiddbe of the page, it say
“However.”

Ms. Goodpasture, Wait a minute,

(Pause)

Mr. Goldsmith. Seven lines from the bottom, starting
with the word "However," I would like for you to read.that.

Ms. Goodpasture, The last,

Mr. Goldsmith, “However, here again, there was." That
is what I am referring to. Just read that section please.

(Pause)

Is the information contained in that section starting
with "However" until the end of that page, accurate?

Ms, Goodpasture, To the best of my knowledge it is,
but I am not so sure whether or not the cameras. used a
separate roll of film for each day after the assassination or
before, I think it was after the assassination, That part
right here is. not clear.

The reason I say Me was after that period, because if
you will look at the log of the film that eccurred in October

you will note:meze than one day on thatroll of film,

Mr. Goldsmith. Who reviewed them?

something at thé request of Mr, Scott, if he came down and
asked me to go over the photographs for such and such a

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ‘review, did you give all of

it was not a working day, a Saturday. But the photo base |
houses were places where people lived and if they saw some~ i
thing that they thought was unusual, they could make a pic- '
ture anytime they wanted to and send it in. But they were |
normally required to be on duty during the times when the
Embassy had working hours.

Does that explain, it?

Mr.-Goldsmith. That may explain. it in part. I think

we should pursue this just a bit.

The photograph that you found of a person going to one |
of these embassies was taken on September 28th, is that
correct?

the transcripts: and Shaw was the one. who reviewed then,

Mx. Goldsmith. Is it possible in fact that the photo-

4 graph. that you found was thesphotograph that was taken on
September 28th, 1963? |
Ms, Goodpasture, To answer: your question we would have
to check the log because the log has the date of the phato-
graphs and a copy of the photograph. attached to it.
Mr. Goldsmith, In any event, with regard to the conver=|
sation of October lst and the. conversation of October 28th,
these came to your attention right around that time period as
opposed to some time after the assassination, is that correct?’
Ms, Goodpasture.. The conversations that had the name i

Mr. Goldsmith. If it is true that foreigners were
frequently visiting the embassies on days other than working
days, then why was the photo-surveillance operation confined
to working days?

Ms, Goodpasture., Because the people could not work
around the clock. They had to have:some time off, One of
the photographers, as I recall, was a:part~time student, or
something, but it was not possible to have that thing going
all the time,

I think later maybe it set up a mechanical type surveil.

Mr, Goldsmith. However, there were three different
camera sites?

Ms. Goodpasture, They did not all hit the same place.

Mr. Goldsmith, Is it not possible; despite staffing
problems, that on Saturday and Sunday at least one of the
photo sites could have. been maintained?

Ms, Goodpasture, It could have been possible if we had
been working, if our photographers had been American citizens
and staff agents, but we were working with Mexicans and not
many of them worked on Sundays, normally, That was their day
off,

Mr. Goldsmith,. How about Saturdays? 0012 30

Mr. Goldsmith. In effect, they woulld have had an

Mr. Goldsmith, Is your explanation that whomever |

date of the cable?

Ms. Goodpasture, 8 October,
Mr, Goldsmith, If the photograph was. taken on October

get it and bring it in.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated earlier in your testimony \

that the photograph you. found was never linked to Oswald, yet |

specifically refers to an American male who said his name '

could possibly have related to Oswald.

Are there any questions. at this time?

Ms. Goodpasture, No, because at that stage, we had no

‘way of proving that the man who made that call in Mexico was

the same man that this trace was about.

Mr. Goldsmith, The cable from headquarters gives back~ j

ground information on Mr, Oswald, does it not? i
Ms. Goodpasturé, Right.

We assumed that it probably was.

Mr. Goldsmith. Right.

After receiving the cable, a voice comparison is made.
It is determined that the. same person was talking on each
tape and there is no follow-up to headquarters , even though

Mr, Goldsmith. The point is, howevey, that upon the

Mr. Goldsmith. There are other indications on the

cable as well that headquarters regarded this incident to be

significant, is that not true? The cable also contains other

$ indications that indicated that headquarters regarded this

7 matter to be significant, is that not true?

3 For example, in paragraph 4 -- I am referring now to

C. 20024 (202) $$h~23n5

page 5 of Stack C, paragraph 4 -- it says, “Station should
pass info RIF(1) and it gives cryptonyms of various. govern-
mental agencies. Certainly that. is an indication that
headquarters regarded this as significant.

Ms. Goodpasture, That’ information was taken immediately
and all efforts were made to locate the man in Mexico, thinks |

that he had come back to the states, i

One question that.was out of the line of my inquiry

that I was making prior to the recess, at the time that
the Oswald reco-ding was obtained, did you or anyone else
go to Boris Tarasoff and indicate to him that this was a matter
of special importance and needed to be transcribed. immedi~

or whether the outside agent took it to Tarasoff; but it was

taken to Tarasoff at the same time that it came in from the

base,

Mr, Goldsmith. Was Tarasoff given special instructions |

that this particular recording was of unusual importance?

Ms. Goodpasture, I am quite sure that he was asked

to transcribe it immediately.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why would he have been asked to transcribe

it immediately?

Ms. Goodpasture.. So they could find out whether there

inside could not understand. . They could not tell if the
man had a telephone number there or if he had an address
or if he gave more information in the Russian language than

his. name.

The only thing they got was his name, which I, believe

was in English.

Mr. Goldsmith, Even so, why could they not have waited

for the ordinary lag time to ensure prior to the transcrip-

tion of the recording?

Ms, Goodpasture, Wait a minute, We are talking about

two different things. The reason that he would have been
asked, Tarasoff would have been asked, to transcribe it
immediately would have been because we had a name connected
with it. Most of Tarasoff's transcription work was trans-
cribing Russian to English, but the conversations were with
persons who were in the Embassy, Soviet personnel, and in

that process he huilt up a backlog,

So if something came in. that was not. a Soviet or

something other than the people who we knew there talking,
| he would have been asked to do that immediately before the
chit-chat. conversation translations of people who were

living in the Embassy.

Now do you understand what I am talking about?

cate that by writing down the word "sic" I presume that all
we would have to dois to review cable traffic or routing i

Mr. Goldsmith, Thank you.

In this regard, I would like to refer. to Stack B, the
document, page 1 in Stack B,.which is the transcript oftthe
conversation in reference to Oswald.. That is Stack B, page
1. This is a transcription of a conversation involving
Oswald that. took place on 1 October 1963.

By the line which immediately follows the number 151
in brackets it says "the same person who phoned a day or so
ago and spoke in broken Russian."

In your interview with Mr. Minell, I am sure that he
would remember if he did.

Mr. Dodd, Let me interrupt. for one second.

Miss Gocdpasture, at the time that you were sitting down

and having discussions over these November 23 -- over this
