TESTIMONY OF ANN GOODPASTURE

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you state your name and address

for the record?

Ms. Goodpastrue. My name is Ann Goodpasture. My local

address is with friends in Maryland, 5600 Bridgeview.

My mailing address, at the moment, is in care of my

father in Livingstone, Tennessee.

MI. Fithian. If I may, now that we have your name on

the record and your address, I would like to explain our

proceedings here, Miss Goodpasture.

The House Resolution 222, under which this Subcommittee

acts, mandates that the Committee conduct a full and complete

investigation and study of the circumstances surrounding the

assassination and the death of President John F. Kennedy

including determining whether the existing laws of the United

States concerning the protection of the President and the

investigatory jurisdiction and capability of agencies and

departments are adequate in their provisions and enforcement;

and whether there was full disclosure of evidence and informa-

tion among agencies and departments of

the United States

government; and whether any information or evidence not in

theppossession of an agency or department would have been of

assistance in investigating the assassination; and why such

information was not provided or collected by that agency or

department; and to make recommendations to the House, if the

Select Committee deems it appropriate, for the amendment of

existing legislation or the enactment of new legislation.

I would like, because of the special expertise of this

witness, if counsel will withhold for just a moment, say a

word of two about the process that we are engaged in.

First, we commend you for your long years of service

to a very, very important agency of this

government. I:

personally was a part of that in a very, very small way in

the Navy a long time ago, and I commend you for your dedica-

tion and your experience and what has come to be your reputa

tion for, as we have talked with other members of the agency,

they have referred to you as sort of the touchstone, or the

person who was the expert among the experts.

I want to say also that I personally want to commend

our Chief Counsel, Professor Blakey, and our assistant

counsels for their long and dilligent effort to build a

relationship with the agencies which is now beginning to be

extremely productive and fruitful in our whole process of

trying to get all the information and to lay the matter of

the assassination of the President of the United States to

rest permanently with the complete story.

I just wanted you to know that we have been working

with the CIA and the FBI and they have been very cooperative

with us as well as the State Department in the two investi-

gations in which we are now engaged, and I look forward to

Ms. Goodpasture. I read this yesterday.

Mr. Goldsmith. - Exhibit No. 94 is a copy of a letter

written by the present Director of Central Intelligence to the

Chairman of this Committee.

I believe a copy was given to

you yesterday, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you read that letter yesterday?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes:

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you understand that letter?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated that you worked with the

Central Intelligence Agency for 31 years. Which branch within

the CIA did you work

for?

Ms. Goodpasture. For the entire length of time?

MI. Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I worked for a number of

different branches, but most of the time I was outside of the

United States and it came under what is now called the

Director of Operations, or clandestine service.. I suppose

that would be a more appropriate term.

Mr. Goldsmith Fine.

When did you retire from the CIA?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think it was in June, 1973.

Mr. Goldsmith. Miss Goodpasture, I am drawing your

attention to 1963. Where were you stationed at that time?

Mr. Goldsmith. Who was the Chief of Station?

Ms. Goodpasture. Winston Scott.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it appropriate to refer to you as

having been Winston

Scott's righthand man during your term

of service in Mexico City?

Ms. Goodpasture. I take exception to that. First of

all, I am not a man; and second, I think that his righthand

person was his Deputy who participated in all the decision

making processes, which I did not, and acted for Mr. Scott

in his absence.

A lot of people said that I was Winn's right hand because e

at times he asked me to do things for him that. he did not ask

other people to do. He depended upon me for certain projects

that he managed, or

he wanted to manage, and I did the legwork

for it.

I would not say that I was his right hand in the entire

station.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated that you were not

Were YOu

privy. to the actual decision-making process?

Ms. Goodpasture. It depended upon what it concerned.

If it was a project that I worked on, I participated in it,

but if it were a station activity, I did not.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did youwork at the station in Mexico

City also involve occasionally making contact with CIA agents

in the field?

Ms • Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Would you give the Congressional panel

an evaluation of Winn Scott's competence as the Chief of

Station?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I think that he was a very

conscientious man, he was a hardworking man, he expected

everyone else. to do their work, he worked long hours.

Some

people felt, or expressed the opinion, in my presence, that

he was a hard worker and expected too much from employees,

but I do not think that that was really the case. He was

a very conscientious man, an intelligent man. He obviously

had the intelligence for the post, or he would not have been

assigned there.

MI. Goldsmith. Is the Mexico City station one of the

largest CIA stations in operation?

Ms. Goodpasture, At the present time, I do not know.

At that time, it was one of the largest ones in Latin America,

but not in comparison to the other places. I could not

comment on the size of the other places.

Mr. Goldsmith. What kind of attitude did Mr. Scott

have towards the importance of files and recordkeeping systems

at the Mexico City station?

Ms. Goodpasture. He was very conscientious. He wanted

them maintained accurately and completely.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long were the files that he main-

tained preserved?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I am not too sure about that.

They were there up until the time that I left, but I think

that there was a reduction because of space in 1969. 'The

files were cut back, but I do not have firsthand knowledge

of that because I did not participate in it.

Mr. Goldsmith. During the time that you were in Mexico

City with Mr. Scott, to your knowledge was anything ever

thrown out of destroyed from the Mexico City station files?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, several things were destroyed

that were not considered of any value as far as the work at

that time was concerned.

We looked at it more or less like

limitation of space on just how long you could keep certain

official files that could be destroyed without a certificate

of destruction being made. That did not apply to our rough

notes that we made, but you could not take a file out, go

through it and tear it up because you did not like something

in it.

Mr. Goldsmith. It has been said of Mr. Scott that

during his tenure in Mexico City not even a shred of paper

was thrown out or moved from the Mexico City station files.

would you say that is an accurate statement?

Ms. Goodpasture. Some of the rough paper was thrown

out, the rough paper that he considered supporting data for a

dispatch that he had written or a cable that he sent, he kept.

He insisted that other people do the same thing.

Mr. Goldsmith, Fine.

At this time, I am going to get into the area of the

surveillance operations in Mexico City.

Miss Goodpasture, what kinds of surveillance operations

did the CIT have in Mexico City in 1963 with respect to the

Soviet and Cuban consulate and embassies?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, we had electronic surveillance,

wiretaps, which covered telephone conversations.

Mr. Goldsmith, If I may interrupt you for a moment, could

you possibly raise the mike closer to your mouth so that we

might hear you better?

Ms. Goodpasture.

We had electronic surveillance,

wiretaps on the telephones in the Soviet Embassy, and we had

photographic surveillance.

There was also what they called foot surveillance at

times, when people were interested, they could find out where

they were staying, where they went from the Soviet Embassy.

Mt. Goldsmith.

That would be physical surveillance?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Turning first to the area of photographic

surveillance, what was the purpose of the photographic

surveillance project with regard to the Soviet and Cuban

embassies and consuls?

Ms. Goodpasture. My understanding of that was that it

was to be used to identify those people who might be working

for the Soviets as espionage agents who were U.s. citizens

who went down there driving a car with a U.S. license plate

on it, or people we did not know but could identify.

The same procedure was also used for trying to identify

people other than U.S. citizens, but it was concentrated in

the beginning on license plates or numbers, or something that

could be identified.

MI. Goldsmith. An attempt would be made to take pic-

tures of both the car, license plates and the occupants of

the car, is that correct?

Ms . Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Turning now to the photographic surveillance operation

with regard to the Soviet Embassy and consulate, I would

like to ask you, what role, if any, did you play with regards

to this surveillance operation during 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. In 1963, I was more or less a bystander

of that operation because the operation, at times, was conducted

by another case officer:

I screened and looked at the photographs because I had

been there in the early part of the operation where the

photograph bases were first set up, were first used. I had

an interest in them, or looked at them to see that they were

in focus, that the negatives were all printed, and Mr.

Scott asked me to do that because I had been a commercial.

photographer before. I went to work for the goverment.

MI. Goldsmith, Are you saying, in 1963, your r01l

with regard to the photographic surveillance at the Soviet

Embassy was to review photographs, essentially to evaluate

their quality?

Ms, Goodpasture. Their technical quality.

Mr. Goldsmith, Not for the purpose of obtaining subse

quent information from the photographs?

Ms. Goodpasture, No, because, at that time, by 1963

there was a staff there who had been assigned to work on

Soviet matters and it was their function to investigate the

leads - we called them leads -- to try to identify the person

at the Soviet embassy they were interested in.

So all the raw material went to them. I usually took

a quick look at the photographs when they came in, and if

I noticed anything significant about them, I mentioned it to

the Soviet case officer, but he gave the formal reporting on

all the Soviet information.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand.

How many cameras were in operation with regard to the

photosurveillance of the Soviet Embassy and consulate?

Ms: Goodpasture. Three. There were three, generally.

There could be any number. if we wanted to put some on

the street, but at that time, I think there were only three.

MI. Goldsmith. Where were these cameras located?

Ms. Goodpasture. Where?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture. They were located around the building.

the embassy building, to cover the area in the yard and in

the front

gate.

Mr. Goldsmith. So the cameras were situated so that

they would photograph the yard area and front entrance gate?

Ms . Goodpasture.

Yes

Mr. Goldsmith. During this period, was your role with

regards to this project at any time of a supervisory nature,

actually supervising the project?

Ms. Goodpasture. Informally it could have been interpreted

in that way, but I never had the responsibility for them

alone.

MI. Goldsmith. As a practical matter, you were acting

in an informal supervising capacity?

Ms. Goodpasture. It could have been interpreted that

way by some of the people, because they would come to me and

bring me photographs and say, what do you think of this, do

you think that this is a latin, or do you think he has ever

been to the Soviet Embassy before.

Mr. Goldsmith. In your own opinion do you think you

were acting, at least infomally, in a supervisory capacity

with regards to this project?

Ms, Goodpasture.

No.

Mr. Goldsmith. At this time, I would like for the

witness to be

given Stack C of the documents that have been

prepared.

documents that appear in Stack C.

Ms. Goodpasture.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to ask you if you can

identify that document.

Ms, Goodpasture.

This looks like a copy of a cable sent

from the Mexico station on the 8th of October.

Mr. Goldsmith. To whom would the cable have been sent?

Ms. Goodpasture. It was sent to Washington.

MI. Goldsmith. CIA Headquarters?

Ms. Goodpasture. CIA Headquarters.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to have you examine the

cable in more detail. I call your attention to the first

paragraph.

What does the term "the envoy" mean?

Ms: Goodpasture. What was that again?

Mr. Goldsmith.: I am sorry. I am drawing your atten-

tion to the first paragraph.

Ms• Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. The second word --

Ms. Goodpasture. Page two?

Mr. Goldsmith. Page two. There appears a word "the

envoy." What does that word

. me an?

Ms. Goodpasture.

That was a cryptonym to identify

the telephone surveillance. Instead of saying a telephone

tap operation we used crytonyms for all of the things that

involved assets outside that could be identified.

MI. Goldsnith. I am not drawing your attention to the

upper lefthand corner of this document. There appears the

word "orig." Whät does that stand for?

Ms. Goodpasture, The person who wrote the cable.

MI. Goldsmith. Does that stand for originating officer?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. You say the originating officer is the

Ms. Goodpasture. The originating officer is Mr. Herbert

Minell.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please listen to my questions carefully

and just answer my questions. I think you may be trying to

anticipate.

Who is identified in the upper lefthand corner as the

person who issued the document? What name is given?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is the term

a pseudonym?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. It is a pseudonym for Herbert Minell?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. I take it that these documents commonly

used pseudonymns, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. In almost all cases that was the

practice.

Mr. Goldsmith. What would be the purpose of using a

pseudonym?

Ms, Goodpasture. In case the document happened to fall

outside classified control, it would be meaningless to the

people who picked it up than if the true name were on it.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand.

Let us take a look at the lower righthand corner of

this same document. It says, releasing officer. What is

a releasing officer?

Ms. Goodpasture.

W. C. Curtis. That was a pseudonym

for Winston Scott.

Ms. Goodpasture. The supervisor, the person who decides

that the message should be sent; generally the releasing offi

cer is the chief, the senior person there at the time, the

person who will assume responsibility for the message after

it has been transmitted.

MI. Goldsmith. The message would go --

Ms. Goodpasture. For instance, in an Embassy, if a

document goes to the communications center signed by someone

who is not the senior person in the section, they will not

send it; just everybody cannot take a message to the message

center and say, send this cable to Washington.

So this is to make sure that the Chief of the Section

knows that is going on by everybody in his section.

Mr. Goldsmith, I would not like to draw your attention

to page 5 of Stack C. That pertains to a different cable, but

simply for the purpose of clarifying terminology, I would

like you to look at the lower righthand corner where it says,

"Authenticating Officer."

What is

an authenticating officer?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, this cable originated in

Washington and in Washington there are more than one chief,

so the person who signs off on it - it may be a Branch Chief.

In this case, it was the Division Chief.

He approved sending the cable and then his superior

released it.

MI. Goldsmith.. So the authenticating officer woüld be

someone under the releasing officer, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, to be sure about that, you

would have to check with the communications people on their

practices, but I think that sometimes it could be the same.

If

the authenticating officer were the Section Chief,

then the Section Chief could also release the message.

Mr. Goldsmith, Were you ever an authenticating officer?

Ms. Goodpasture. No. Well, I have signed off on cables

going out from Headquarters at times, I am sure.

MI, Goldsmith..

• Only from Headquarters?

Ms. Goodpasture. The fact that you sign there as an

authenticating officer does that mean that that is a title,

It means that you were the person who were probably best

informed on that subject, I think.

MI. Goldsmith. For purposes of clarification, is

it the responsibility of the authenticating officer to verify

the contents of the cable?

Ms. Goodpasture.

It might be, I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. What would the specific purpose of an

authenticating officer be?

Ms. Goodpasture. I never went into that terminology

with anyone.

Mr.Fithian. Would the counsel permit a question?

Mr Goldsmith. Yes, sir.

Mr. Fithian. In our Navy communications sytem, we

sometimes distinguished between an authenticating officer as

one who not only authorized the sending of the cable, but

authenticated or verified or vouched for, the content.

Is that similar?

Ms. Goodpasture. That would be the literal interpre

tation of the word. Whether ornot it was used in air traffic.

all the time or not, I do not know.:

My guess would be that that is correct.

MI. Fithian. Do you know whether, in CIA traffic,

you had to have both an authenticating officer and a releasing

officer for a single message?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that there were times when one

person could sign both places.

Mr, Fithian. Thank you, counsel,

I can guess, and my guess is that they were open most of

But the person who would have that information, the only

person who would know, is the case officer who was handling

the project at that time.

The Soviet Embassy changed their

working hours frequently. Their consulate might be open from

8:00 to 10:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays or they

might change it from 10:00 to 12:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

But for me to say now that in September, 1963, without having

a document to prove it; that they were open from 10:00 to

12:00 would be rather foolish because I really do not know

what their hours were at that time.

MI. Goldsmith. Let us refer to a document, then. Will

the Clerk hand the witness Stack D?

Ms • Goodpasture.

We are talking about two different

things here. The surveillance, someone was available there,

but they did not make pictures. They may have been watching

the activity from 9:00 o'clock in the morning until 1:00

o'clock. and may have only made two pictures, one at 11:00

and one at 12:00.

As far as photographic surveillance being continuous,

that would be really inaccurate because it was not a camera

making a picture of every minute's activity.

Mr. Goldsmith, However, there were personnel stationed

at positions outside the Soviet Embassy compound who had

photographic equipment available and ho could take pictures

at any time during daylight hours, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know whether it would be or

not. At any time during daylight hours?

Mr. Goldsmith. I am drawing your attention to the

second paragraph of this document, page 1, the very first

sentence of that paragraph. It says the photographic

coverage of the mentioned installations is of a continuous

nature during daylight hours. Is that an accurate statement?

to be used as background material to try to get together the

information about what was the situation in Mexico at the

time of Oswald's visit and the assassination and to name

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it possible that you were asked to

preparethis memorandum because you had more information

concerning this issue?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, I was asked to do it because the

man who was reviewing it had never been at the Mexico station

and it is just as though he was asked to write a report on this

Mr. Goldsmith. Was anybody else from the Mexico City

station who served with you in 1963 asked to prepare similar

memoranda?

Ms. Goodpasture. I was told that all of the people who

were there at the time would be interviewed and would be

asked to do the same thing that I was asked to do.

Mr. Goldsmith. To your knowledge, did they?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know. I did not see any of

the results, but that does not mean that they did not.

YeS.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Is your name mentioned under that

category?

MS ..

Goodpasture. My name was there in the initial

status.

Mr. Goldsmith. I think the question calls for a yes or

no answer. Was your name --

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. This was in a report that you prepared,

is that correct?

Ms. Goödpasture.' That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. It says Goodpasture, alternate CO in

internal routing. What does that mean?

Mr. Goodpasture. That means that during the time that

Harry Mahoney was there, when the base was first set up, I

was his alternate case officer and I did the internal routing

for the Soviet photographs. My tenure lasted much longer. I

kept an interest in the Soviets - I mean in the photographs.

When the other people were away on holidays I could meet with

their contact and pick up the photographs and route them.

Sometime in 1964, I had nothing more to do with photo-

graphs.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Mahoney left in April, 1959, is

that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith. MI. Mahoney left, according to this,

roughly in April, 1959.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is approximate.

I am not sure

of the date.

Mr. Goldsmith. Understood.

However, you continued working in this particular

capacity through 1964. Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Only when the other people were away,

I met someone outside. That was the function of the alternate

Ms. Goodpasture.

He was a case officer.

MI. Goldsmith. According to page 19, he served in that

capacity from June '63 until October '64, is that correct?

Ms• Goodpasture. I think so.

Mr. Goldsmith. When you say case officer, you mean

case

officer with regard to the Soviet Embassy photosurveil

lance coverage?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that when

received the materials from the photosurveillance operation

he would turn them over, either to you or to Herbert Minell?

Ms. Goodpasture. He sometimes brought the photographs

in to me and I gave them to Herb Minell. On other occasions,

he would give it to Herb Minnel directly.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that

responsibility

in this area was simply to do the leg work on the project,

that he himself was not really in chargé of the project?

Ms. Goodpasture. NI, he managed the projects also. He

had complete supervision of the projects, as well as the leg-

work.

to asking for coverage over a specific investigation?

Mr. Goldsmith. My question is directed towards whether

you were involved in a supervisory capacity with setting the

requirements and policies as to how the photosurveillance

operation would be run.

Ms. Goodpasture. I talked to him about it; but this

was his sole responsibility at the time. He was the case

officer for the project.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that, because of the sensi

tivity of the photosurveillance operation. at the Soviet

Embassy that Winn Scott felt that you were the person who

should run this operation?

Ms . Goodpasture.

I do not think I heard that statement

before. He did not want too many people involved in it

because of the sensitivity and he asked me to review the photo-

graphs to make sure that the outside people did not become

sloppy in the photographic work.

MI.

Goldsmith. Nevertheless, did Winn Scott place you

in a supervisory capacity with regard to this project?

Ms. Goodpasture. No. I never saw anything in writing

that referred to me as supervising the activities of that

project.

Mr. Goldsmith. If not in writing, nevertheless, informally

did Winn Scott designate you as the person who would be super-

vising that project?

Ms. Goodpasture. He may have said informally, I want

you to make sure that those operations are run properly, or

something like that, but I do not think he did. I do not

recall him doing that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that

was the most

junior officer in the station in 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. Agewise, he probably was,

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it also true that the Soviet opera-

tion, in terms of surveillance of the Soviet Embassy, was an

extremely sensitive operation?

Ms. Goodpasture... It was not any more sensitive than

the other operations which

was handling. In fact,

was probably the person most trusted by Winn

scott.

Mr. Goldsmith, I do not believe that the answer is

responsive to my question, though,

Is it true that the Soviet Embassy surveillance opera

tion was one of the most sensitive operations that was in

effect in Mexico City in 1963?

Ms • Goodpasture. I doubt it.

MI. Goldsmith, Would you characterize that operation

as extremely sensitive?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you characterize that surveil-

lance operation as extremely sensitive?

,MS: Goodpasture. It was - I would characterize it as

sensitive to the extent that the Chief of Station did not want

the photographs disseminated and the sourte identified,

that reason it was considered sensitive. But every project

that we had was also considered sensitive that involved a

source who would be in jeopardy if they were identified.

MI. Goldsmith. If

were to say that his

responsibility with regard to that project was simply to do

the legwork on it and not to act in a supervisory capacity,

would he be telling us the truth?.

Ms. Goodpasture. When he first came there -

Mr. Goldsmith. I believe that calls for a yes or no

answer.

Ms. Goodpasture. I am trying to figure out why someone

would make a statement of that type. He felt, I am sure, as

a young officer that he was only doing the legwork, but so

was I. Because the person who made the decisions was the

Chief of Station and his deputy, and they had the remainder

of the people in the station do the legwork, the running

around, meeting the agents; but when it came to make decisions

they made the big decisions, but I did not make any decisions

over

work, if that is what you are getting at.

MI. Goldsmith. With regards to this particular surveil-

lance operation, did you make the decisions on it, or did

make the decisions on it?

Ms: Goodpasture. He made the decisions on it. As far

as management of the project was concerned --

for getting the photographic film from the photography

Ms. Goodpasture. It was picked up at intervals by

meetings with the person outside.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long did it take?

Ms. Goodpasture. There, again, my memory is faulty.

station and distribute it. Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long did this overall process

• take?

Ms. Goodpasture. My guess would be about a week from

the time that the film was exposed, but some of the film

might only be two days old or three days old.

In the roll of film, it would. cover a period of one,

two or three days, so that the last day's coverage on the

film would be more recent than the first part of the film.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you give the panel your evaluation

of the efficiency of the photosurveillance operation?

Ms. Goodpasture.

well, I think that it generally was

very good as far as the coverage was concerned. If we asked

them to get a photograph of the events that occurred between

9:00 and 10:00 on such

and such a date, they usually produced

the photographs for that period.

Mr. Goldsmith. What if they were not specifically asked

to focus on a person, as a matter of routine?

How thorough

was the coverage?

Ms. Goodpasture. They covered the categories that we

asked them for on a routine basis, which was to identify any

people who appeared to be non-latin and any Soviets.

MI. Goldsmith, I understand that was the purpose.

Given that purpose, how thorough was the coverage?

Ms. Goodpasture. 'I think it was accurate.

Ms. Goodpasture.

To the best of my knowledge he was.

MI. Goldsmith, I would now like you to refer to page

20 of the document that you have before you in Stack A-3.

Seven lines from the bottom in the middle of the page, it says

"However."

Ms. Goodpasture, Wait a minute.

(Pause)

Mr. Goldsmith.

Seven lines from the bottom, starting

with the word "However," I would like for you to read that.

Ms• Goodpasture.

The last,

Mr. Goldsmith.

"However, here again, there was." That

is what I am referring to. Just read that section please.

(Pause)

Is the information contained in that section starting

with "However" until the end of that page, accurate?

Ms• Goodpasture. To the best of my knowledge it is,

but I am not so sure whether or not the cameras used a

separate ioll of film for each day after the assassination or

before, I think it was after the assassination, That part

right here is not clear.

The reason I say it was after that period, because if

you will look at the log of the film that occurred in October

you will note more than one day on thatroll of film.

Mr. Goldsmith, Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture' Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Who reviewed them?

Ms. Goodpasture. I

glanced at them and then I gave them

to Herb Minell and he studied them, and if I was looking for

something at the request of Mr. Scott, if he came down and

asked me to go over the photographs for such and such a

period, then I studied them more carefully.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you review, did you give all of

the photographs from the photosurveillance operation of the

Soviet Embassy to Mr. Minell?

Yes. I routed them and then they

went to the file where they were kept, but he had access to

They gave us a 3 x 5 photograph with them in addition to

the sheet, and those 3 x 5 photographs were always given to

MI. Minell to use of to identify the new Soviets or to start

files to try to identify the others. But that was separate

from the file copy, so that may have been what he was

referring to.

Mr. Goldsmith, He was given photographs of significance.

Was he also

given all of the photographs of the Embassy?

Ms, Goodpasture. Yes. He was shown all of the photo

graphs that came. He retained, for his use, the 3 x 5 photo-

graphs, but all the photographs were routed to him.

Mr. Goldsmith, At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would

like to break for any questions that the Committee might have.

Mr. Preyer, I believe we would prefer to complete

the testimony before asking questions.

MI. Goldsmith. I would like to turn now to the photo-

graphic surveillance operation of the Cuban Embassy and

consulate.

What responsibilities, if any, did you have with regard

to that particular operation?

Ms, Goodpasture. At the time, in 1963; none.

regard to that operation?

MI. Goldsmith. Are you able to evaluate the efficiency

of the Cuban photosurveillance operation?

efficient when it was operating as the Soviet one.

MI. Goldsmith. With regard to both the photos that were

what happened to them after they were taken back to the

there, were any of these photographs disposed of?

Ms. Goodpasture: Yes, Some of the earlier photographs,

before we began to set up formal files in the late 1950's were

not used.

During the period that we are talking about to the best

of my knowledge, in 1963, I do not believe any of the photo-

graphs were destroyed as long as Mr. Scott was there.

I wrote a memorandum for it, which should be in this group of

contact print that was in

the original files that we could

not locate.

Mr. Goldsmith. You still had the film?

MS. Goodpasture. The negatives were avaihable.

Mr. Goldsmith. In that case, what is available from

the Mexico City station are all of the photographs, all of

the photographic negatives or contact prints from the pictures

that were taken at the Soviet and Cuöan Embassies and consul

ates in september and October in 1963, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were these materials sent to head-

quarters last year?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, I do not think the material we

could not locate was ever sent to headquarters. I think it

was destroyed in the field.

But the other film, all of the negatives concemed in

this photograph had been sent to headquarters before I began

to look for it last year.

It came up in about 1968 or '69 when certain files

were sent to headquarters,

MI. Goldsmith.

For purposes.of clarification, is it

true that, available at headquarters or the Mexico City station

are either the contact prints or the negatives of all of the

pictures that were taken at the Cuban and Soviet Embassy and

With the one exception that I

mentioned, the others are all available.

Mr, Goldsmith. Are you saying that there was not a

production log with regard to the contact prints?

Ms• Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith,

The others were all available from the

Cuban and Soviet Embassy and consulates, is that right?

Ms. Goodpasture, Correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like now to turn to the area of

the electronic surveillance operation of the Cuban and

Soviet Embassies and consulates.

How many wiretap operations were in effect with respect

to these embassies and consulates in September and October of

1963?

Ms, Goodpasture. Do you mean how many lines were

covered, or how many projects did we have?

operations, you are referring to unilateral, not a lateral?

How

many projects were there?

Ms. Goodpasture. We had one that we ran independently

and one that was a liaison project.

referred to as the unilateral project?

Ms : Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. With regard to the one that was run

independently, how many taps did you have in operation

with regard to phones at the Soviet Embassy and consulate?

Ms. Goodpasture.

On the unilateral one?

MI. Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms, Goodpasture, I would have to guess without checking

the files.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am Just asking for an estimate.

Ms. Goodpasture. I think -- I do not think that there

was any coverage of the Soviets on the unilateral in September

1963. I think all of that was on the liaison. On the Cubans,

I think there were one or two lines,

Mr. Goldsmith. For purposes of clarification, again

we are now talking about the period September-October, 1963.

Turning to the liaison project, how many taps were in effect

at the Soviet Embassy?

Ms, Goodpasture, I believe there were five.

event, before I get to the question that I just asked you,

how many phones were tapped at the Cuban Embassy and consulate?

Ms, Goodpasture.

The Cuban Embassy, four or five.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall which phones?

• To the best

of your memory, which phones were taped in the Cuban --

Ms, Goodpasture. Four or five.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall which ones?

Ms• Goodpasture, Which ones?

Not by menory, but I

listed them all a year ago when I reviewed the transcripts,

so there is a list of all the films that were covered at that

time in the records.

Mr, Goldsmith, Did the Mexicans have any unilateral

coverage with regard to the Soviet and Cuban embassies?

Ms. Goodpasture. The project was joint. They had the

same coverage that we had

they, themselves, had a unilateral project? It is possible,

have - but they shared with us the coverage from the joint

project:

Mr. Goldsmith. What were your responsibilities with

regard to the wiretapping operations?

Ms. Goodpasture. Legwork and maangement.

Mr, Goldsmith. By management, what do you mean?

Ms. Goodpasture. I recorded all the correspondence,

getting the money, paying the people who did the work, making

sure that the machinery was functioning, picking up all of

the transcripts and supervising most of the people involved

with it, except for the Mexicans.

MI. Goldsmith. In addition to electronic surveillance

ofaa wiretapping nature, were there any "bugs" planted in the

Cuban or Soviet Embassy and consulate?

Ms, Goodpasture. I think there were, but I do not have

firsthand knowledge of them. I think that the best person

to give you the best information on that would be the Cuban

case officers. We never put anything in the Soviet Embassy.

MI. Goldsmith. If you did, would there have been a

transcript made of the conversations that were overheard?

Ms, Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would those transcripts still be on

record at the agency today?:

Ms. Goodpasture. I was told that you had a copy of

all the transcripts and, with those transcripts, there was

list of the lines that were covered, both Cuban and soviet.

Mt. Goldsmith. In addition to the electronic surveil-

lance both of a wiretap and of a bugging nature, did the

Mexico City station have any penetration agents at the Cuban

Embassy?

Ms. Goodpasture.

penetration agents at the Soviet Embassy and consulate?

because the Cuban Embassy had locals employed and there were

who would know about that. It is not in the records.

Fine.

Turning to the scope of coverage, at what times were

Right,

Mr. Goldsmith.

If you are unable to find that at this

time, perhaps we could pursue it later. It would be best

to continue with the inquiry

Ms. Goodpasture. Here it is, on page 4.

Mr. Goldsmith. where specifically on page 4?

Ms. Goodpasture. The files contained the photographs

for the period. 2. May '67 to 30: of June '67 were in

a folder that had been used, that was marked to hold files

from the period 23 July '63 until 30 November "63.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let us see if we can.

I get this straight.

First of all, even though the contact prints would not

be available, the original negatives still would be. That

Is correct, is it not?

Ms, Goodpasture. The log for this one base, this one

photographic source, was not available,

Mr, Goldsmith.

The original negatives would still be

available?

Ms, Goodpasture. The negatives are available and the

original photographs are available because they were sent to

Washington, But this file was destroyed, I suppose accidentally.

that was kept of the photographs taken during this period,

longer available?

Now; another source that made photographs at the saie

time, their logs are avalable for the same period.

are you getting at?

That there were three bases, there

man.

to only one of the three photo sites that were in operation

generally picked it up early in the

copies of the transcripts.

tions that I picked up, the transcribers were working at the

Ms. Goodpasture.:

Not always because they were routed

to the people who took the action on them, and in the case

of some of those transcripts, there was a stack about an

inch or so thick, and if you took the time to read them, then

the people who had to take the action on them did not get to

see them, so I generally took them and passed them out.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you review most of them?

Ms. Goodpasture. I had more than one copy so I could

look at them, if there was something of significance.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am not sure that I am following you.

As a matter of routine you would review it, or would you

pass it along?

Ms. Goodpasture. I would pass it along, first. I kept

one

copy myself for files and I had access to that copy.

Mr. Goldsmith. In the case of transcripts from the

Soviet compound, they woüld go to Mr. Minell, is that correct?

Ms, Goodpasture. That is right.

area of the wiretap operations of the Cuban and Soviet

embassies, would you indicate to the Committee in what manner

the photosurveillance and the wiretap operations were tied

into each other?

Ms. Goodpasture. On a wiretap operation, if we got

information that someone was

going to one of those places far

in adyance, we would notify the people taking the photographs

to try to get pictures of them.

That was one way we were tied in, Another way we were

tied in was if we saw where a person had been there at such

and such a time, we would check back to see if there was

a photograph made during that period and if there was any

way that that person could be identified.

Mr. Goldsmith. Similarly, if there was a tape-recording

made of a conversation and from the conversation it became

apparent that the person at issue was either at one of the

embassies or was going to go to one of the embassies, it would

be possible, would it not, to go to the photo-production logs

and determine who that person was?

Ms. Goodpasture. We could determine if there was a

photograph there and if the photograph appeared to be the same

person that came

upon the wiretap.

Now, there might be someone speaking English and the only

photograph that we had was someone that was obviously a Latin

whom we knew who did not speak English. We could rule him out!

as being the person who made the call.

Mr. Goldsmith. In what manner would this procedure take

place if you knew that someone was either going to the Embassy

or that he was there at a particular time? How would you go

about checking to see if you had a photograph of that person?

Ms. Goodpasture. If we knew afterwards that he had been

there?

coverage?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Yes.

The log was prepared in such

way that they listed the time and the description of the

person who went there.

Mr. Goldsmith. I believe earlier you testified as a

matter of routine, the photo-surveillance operations would

take pictures of foreigners - in other words, a non-Mexican

and of Soviet or Cuban personnel, is that true?

Ms. Goodpasture. Soviet, yes. Well, I do not know

about the Cubans, but I can say that for sure for the Soviets.

Mr. Goldsmith. They would take the photograph of some-

one who did not fit that category if they were given notice

in advance that someone happened to be of interest, is that

correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

(Pause)

Mr. Preyer. We have another vote on the House Floor.

I suggest that we take another moment while I go over and

vote. We will recess for about five minutes.

(A brief recess was taken.)

MI. Preyer. The Committee will resume.

You may resume questioning.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Thank you.

Miss Goodpasture, who would give notice to the photo

surveillance units to take a picture of a particular individual.

Ms. Goodpasture. Would you repeat that, please?

Mr. Goldsmith. Certainly•

Let us assume that it is decided that a particular

individual is important and should be photographed.

Ms. Goodpasture.

Yes.

MI. Goldsmith, Who would give notice to the photo-

surveillance units of.that fact?

"Ms. Goodpasture. The case officer handling the project.

That would have been

Mr. Goldsmith. Assuming, for example, that one of the

people monitoring the wiretap operation picked up a conversa-

tion that the person regarded to be significant and in that

conversation it became apparent that something was of interest

Would it be standard procedure for that person to call

directly to the photo-surveillance sites?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, because that person did not know

any of the people onducting the photo-surveillance. Now I

think in the case of the unilateral operation which was

also handled unilaterally, wiretap operation, it was also

handled by

Mr. Goldsmith. How long would it take for notice to

be given?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, the length of time that it would

take to call somebody and locate them and talk to them,

normally we did not give them that information on the telephone.

It could be one day, two days, or three days.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would it be possible for the individual

monitoring the telephone conversation to call his case officer

directly, or to call you directly?

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. To call the case officer directly and

then for the case officer to immediately contact the photo-

surveillance operations and tell them to take a picture of

a particular individual?

Ms. Goodpasture.

In the case of

s operation,

it would, but in the case of the ones I handled, it would

not, They had to go through the person whom I met outside,

then he got in touch with me and I gave the notice to Tom

and Tom took it to his people.

MI. Goldsmith.

You are drawing a distinction now between

the operations

handled and those which you handled.

What is the distinction you are making? Which operations did

he handle?

Ms. Goodpasture. He handled the unilateral telephone

I would like to clarify this point in terms of the photo

production logs from the surveillance operations from the

Cuban Embassy and consulate and Soviet Embassy and consulate.

Those materials were all available the last time you knew

with the exception of that particular contact page, and the

photoproduction page pertaining to that contact page, is

Ms, Goodpasture. They are available, yes.

That is

correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. On the transcripts that were made of

the telephone conversations, would the transcript have an

indication of the telephone line that was being tapped?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. And the location of the telephone?

In

other words, the soviet Embassy, Cuban Embassy?

MI. Goldsmith. Yes:

Ms. Goodpasture. On that day. That was when we first

found out that he was there.

Mr. Goldsmith. On October Ist, you found out that

Oswald had been at the Russian Embassy the preceding Saturday.

Was any effort made to check your materials from the surveil

lance operation, the photographic surveillance operation, or

from the telephonic surveillance operation to get additional

information: on this?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know whether I checked it

immediately or not at this stage. I do know that they were

checked thoroughly after the assassination, In fact, I

MI. Goldsmith. Is the answer to my question yes?

Ms. Goodpasture. To check the record files to see if

we have a record of that name previously, but to check back

Ms Goodpasture. This conversation was recorded at

1151 hours on the 28th. The 28th was on a Saturday. We

would have gotten it probably on Monday, following the 28th.

Then it would have

gone out to Mr. Tarasoff who would

have made a trnaslation from the Russian.

photographs and, upon receiving the photographs of production,

you checked these materials, is that correct?

Harvey Oswald?

North American appearing male?

is that correct?

Ms • Goodpasture. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am a bit confused, now. Earlier in

your téstimony I recall your indicating that the photo-surveil

lance operation was coordinated with the working hours of the

embassies:

Here we have a situation where the embassies were

not working.

Ms, Goodpasture.. I think the photograph was the 27th,

not the 28th. I made a mistake:

Mr. Goldsmith. If I may finish, here we have a situation

where the photograph was taken on the 28th. This was a

Saturday. If the photograph were taken on the 28th then, in

fact, the photo-surveillance operation was in effect on a

Saturday, which was a non-working day for the Cuban and

Soviet embassies, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. If the photograph was made on the 28th,

it was not a working day, a Saturday. But the photo base

houses were places where people lived and if they saw some-

thing that they thought was unusual, they could make a pic-

ture anytime they wanted to and send it in. But they were

normally required to be on duty during the times when the

Embassy had working hours.

Does that explain it?

Mx. Goldsmith. That may explain it in part. I think

we should pursue this just a bit.

The photograph that you found of a person going to one

of these embassies was taken on September 28th, is that

correct?

Ms, Goodpasture. I would have to look at them to

see.

Right now I am a little confused about that nyself,

because this man appeared there several times, but we have

copies of those and the dates on them. I do not know if they

are here of not, but I went through the files that we had to

put those dates on.

Mt. Goldsnith. I am afraid that none of the materials

that yourand. I reviewed yesterday pertained to September 28th

or even September 27th, so I am unable to show you any produc-

tion materials for those two days.

Ms. Goodpasture. It was not the 28th. They are not

here. I guess it was on the 2nd of October that he appeared

the first time.

Mr. Goldsmith. You are saying now that you are not

sure whether you found the photograph of September 28th?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not have them here, but I did

get all the photographs of that man, together with the dates

on them, which I think you have. When I was looking here on

this 28th transcript, I said 28th and what I was "thinking

was that when we checked the photographs for the days around

the time of the call, we found the photograph, but I do not

know what day it was now, right off the top of my head.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you find a photograph of just one

person who appeared to be North American in appearance?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith.

How many days' photographic surveillance

coverage did you review?

Ms. Goodpasture. How many days?

Mr. Goldsmith, Right.

Ms. Goodpasture.

They were the same days that were

mentioned in the transcripts.

MI. Goldsmith. Four or five days?

Would that be a

fair estimate?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Right.

Mr. Goldsmith.

I notice Mr. Shaw's name on this, on

the top of the page, page 2, Why would his name be up there?

Ms, Goodpasture. His name would be on here because the

telephone call came from a woman from the Cuban Embassy, but

he was responsible for the Cuban Embassy coverage.

The first line of that says woman from the consulate,

Cuban Embassy.

MI. Goldsmith. Why did this particular document go to

Shaw rather than to Dave Phillips?

Ms. Goodpasture. Because Shaw had handled most of the

routine work and I think he

was the one who read all of the

transcripts. But to be perfectly exact about it, I am not

too sure. I suppose Dave Phillips did not have time to read

the transcripts and Shaw was the one who reviewed them

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it possible in fact that the photo-

graph. that you found was thephotograph that was taken on

September 28th, 1963?

Ms, Goodpasture. To answer your question we would have

to check the log because the log has the date of the photo-

graphs and a copy of the photograph attached to it.

Mr. Goldsmith. In any event, with regard to the conver-

sation of October Ist and the conversation of October 28th;

these came to your attention right around that time period

as

opposed to some time after the assassination, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. The conversations that had the name

in it, Lee Oswald, came to my attention right after the

conversation occurred.

MI. Goldsmith, The conversation of the 28th, when did

that first come to your attention?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not recall seeing it until after

the assassination.:

MI. Goldsmith. However, was your testimony earlier to

the effect: that upon receiving the conversation reflected on

page 2, the September 28th, 1963 conversation, and after it

was made, to locate a picture of the person who was going to

the Russian Embassy, you did indicate that, did you not?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, this conversation may have

been tied into the Oswald conversation by the Russian trans-

criber because he did both of them about the same time.

There was only one day's difference. It

is logical

to assume that he would have recognized the voice, and we

probably had both transcripts at the same time looking for a

man when we were examining the photographs.

Mr, Goldsmith. This, in all likelihood, would have

been brought to your attention,

Ms• Goodpasture. When?

Mr. Goldsmith, Shortly after September 28th?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right. If it was with the lee Oswald

but MI. Minell and I looked at them after, his wife and I

examined them after the Oswald name first appeared.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, this conversation did come

to your attention well before the assassination?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there anything, in your opinion,

unusual about Oswald's being at the Cuban Embassy on a

Saturday?

Ms: Goodpasture. I do not think that the Cuban Embassy

connection was tied in until afterwards, I do not know®

There were two calls on the 27th to the Cuban Embassy.

MI. Goldsmith, I will rephrases the question. It is

apparently that, on September 28, 1963, Oswald, according to

this conversation, was at the Cuban Embassy.

That is where

the conversation was made from, so at that day he was at the

Cuban Embassy. You indicated that that would not have been

a working day for the Cuban Embassy, is that correct?

Ms, Goodpasture. The photo-surveillance, you mean?

Mr. Goldsmith, Saturday would not have been a working

day for the Cuban Embassy.

Ms, Goodpasture. That/is right.

MI. Goldsmith. Was there anything unusual about

Oswald's being at the Cuban Embassy on a day that was not a

working day?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, because foreigners were going to.

both places and ringing the door bell and the gate-keeper

frequently let them in on days other than working days.

Mr. Goldsmith. If it is true that foreigners were

frequently visiting the embassies on days other than working

days, then why was the photo-surveillance operation confined

to working days?

Ms. Goodpasture. Because the people could not work

around the clock. They had to have some time off. One of

the photographers, as I recall, was apart-time student, or

something, but it was not possible to have that thing going

all the time.

I think later maybe it set up a mechanical type surveil-

lance that ran continuously.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, there were three different

camera sites?

Ms. Goodpasture. They did not all hit the same place.

MI. Goldsmith. Is it not possible, despite staffing

problems; that on Saturday and Sunday at least one of the

photo sites could have been maintained?

Ms. Goodpasture. It could have been possible if we had

been working, if our photographers had been American citizens

and staff agents, but we were working with Mexicans and not

many of them worked on sundays, normally. That was their day

off.

MI. Goldsmith, How about Saturdays?

Ms. Goodpasture. There were three different photo

surveillances, but they all did not cover the same spot.

Mr. Goldsmith. Even though there were three different

surveillance operations of each Embassy on non-working days,

all three were shut down, is that correct?

unidentified until headquarters sent traces on Oswald. Now,

that would have been in answer to the cable that was dated

8th October. I believe their cable was 18 October, and

voices compared by

was the pseudonym

used by Tarasoff.

with the others, with Oswald's call, in which he used his

name.

Mr. Goldsmith. How many times did Oswald visit the

Cuban and Soviet embassies and consulates?

Ms • Goodpasture.

We did an analysis of the conversa-

tions which indicated, I think, five times.

MI. Goldsmith. He visited the embassy and consulate

approximately five times?

And even though he visited these

places five times, the station's photosurveillance operations

never took a picture of him, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

MI. Goldsmith. Is there any reason that you can give

as to why the photosurveillance operation, having had five

shots at Mr. Oswald, nevertheless --

Ms, Goodpasture.: I could speculate, but I just assume

that he went there later in the day than they were still

wroking.

Mx. Goldsmith.

In effect, they would have had an

opportunity to get a picture of Mr. Oswald, or the person who

said he was Mr. Oswald, when he went into the embassy and

when he went out of there, so really, there were ten oppor-

tunities to take pictures of Mr. Oswald and yet there was no

picture taken of him,

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. After the assassination, was he satis-

fied with the performance of the photo-surveillance operation

in regard to this particular matter?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, we still did not have the

exact times that Oswald went to these places, the inferences

that he used and we could not prove that one of our people

was sitting there, making photographs, and missed him,

Human error if the photograph station was working that

he was missed.

Mr. Golasmith. Without intending to sound argumenta

tive in any way, I would raise the question that needs to be

raised, which is how efficient is the photosurveillance

operation that has ten opportunities to take a picture of

someone and apparently fails in each instance?

Ms, Goodpasture. I think the people that were handling

the photobase at that time sat down and tried to figure out

why it happened. As I recall, they did not think it was

terribly unusual.

I think the Cubans said their machinery was not .

functioning, and I think for the Soviets it was ata time

when they were not working, but I am not sure.

of someone else who was at the embassies at the time when

Oswald was thought to have

gone there?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you or anybody else find a picture

of somebody who went to the Cuban or Soviet embassies at a

time whenoswald was thought to have gone there?

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

We found a photograph of a man

but later it was determined that he went there after Oswald

had left.

Ms. Goldsmith, When you found this particular photo-

graph, did you think that it pertained to Oswald?

Ms. Goodpasture. We did not know, because at the time

that photograph was found, as I recall, we did not know

that Oswald had already left there, It was not until after

the assassination that we had the dates of Oswald's

departure from Mexico.

Up until the assassination time and after the assassina-

tion, it still could have been pertinent that this man who

was unidentified could have been Oswald if he had been still

there the 15th.

Mr. Goldsmith. But the agency or the Mexico City sta-

tion never made a connection between this man and Oswald?

Ms , Goodpasture, No.

Mr. Goldsmith. I have just handed you a document that

shows an individual. The background, the document contains a

Ms. Goodpasture.

Yes:

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like now to refer you to Stack

c, page 2.

We have reviewed this particular document before.

Do you have it before you?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. We reviewed this document earlier today,

have we not?

Ms: Goodpasture. Right.

MI. Goldsmith. Drawing your attention to the first

paragraph, it indicates, does it not, on 1 October 63 an

American male speaking broken Russian made contact with the

Soviet embassy. Is that correct?

Ms Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. In the second paragraph, it refersito a

photograph, does it not?

Ms • Goodpasture.:

Yes.

Mr, Goldsmith. Does the second paragraph refer to the

photograph I have just given you?

Mr. Goldsmith. Does it refer to the photograph I have

just given you a copy of?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes. It refers to a photograph of

this man. I am not sure that these photographs were made.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, nine or ten photographs may

have been taken of this particular man? We do not know that

this was the particular one taken on that day, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why was the reference made in this

cable to a photograph taken on October I, 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. It should have been October 2. That

October Ist was the wrong date. I showed you the log yesterday

-to show you how that error occurred.

MI. Goldsmith. At this point, let us look at the 109.

In order to do that, you will have to look

at Stack A. It

is A-4. I believe it is marked Stack A-4. Do you have that

before you? Do you have the log before you?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Looking at the log, can you now

explain to the Committee why the cable referred to a photo-

graph taken on October Ist when actually it was taken on

another day?

Ms. Goodpasture. If you look at the log here you see

at the top - it was just an oversight on the part of the

person who was writing that cable. It looks as though the

date is 1 October, but if you read it very closely you see

there are only two frames that were shot on 1 October and

2 October, it starts up with frame number 3, et cetera, et

cetera, and there the shots occur. That is the only explana

tion I can give.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is your explanation that whomever

referred to the log simply looked at the date at the top of

the page, the date being October Ist, and did. not see any

reference tolthe date October 2nd?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Getting back to the cable, what is the

date of the cable?

Ms • Goodpasture. & October.

Mr. Goldsmith. If the photograph was taken on October

2nd, what was the reason for the delay in transmitting this

information to headquarters?

Ms. Goodpasture.. It took about a week for processing,

generally. Two or three days. Someone had to go out and

get it and bring it in.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated earlier in your testimony

that the photograph you found was never linked to Oswald, yet

paragraph. 2 of this cable is tied in to paragraph 1 which

specifically refers to an American male who said his name

was Oswald.

Does that not indicate that, in fact, the link was made?

Ms. Goodpasture.

As I said, the link was made earlier.

It did not

this cable was written, the person who wrote it thought it

could possibly have related to Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. I believe that my question earlier was

clear. If you have a problem understanding my questions,

please tell me.

Are there any questions at this time?

Mr. Preyer. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. When did the inaccurate description of

Oswald contained in the first paragraph first come to your

attention?

Ms. Goodpasture.: Page 3?

Mr. Goldsmith. Let us take a look at page 3. Can you

identify the cable that appears on page 3?

Oswald is different than the description in paragraph 2.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it your testimony, then, that based

upon the description of swald in paragraph 1 of that cable

it was realized that the photograph that had been taken on

October 2nd in fact did not show Oswald?

Ms. Goodpasture. It was realized that it was not

Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like now to refer to page 5.

Mr. Dodd. Counsel, just one point.

What was your response to that last question?

Mr. Goldsmith. I believe Congressman Dodd has a

question.

MI. Dodd. What was your response to that last question?

Ms. Goodpasture. The last question, that the identifi-

cation of Oswald that they had a file trace on in the Washing-

ton cable was different from the one that the description of

the man who was in the photograph.

Mr. Dodd. You reached that conclusion on what day;

with the 10 October '63 cable, what day would you have

received that on that day, 10 October?

Ms. Goodpasture. We would have received it on about

the 10th or Ilth of October, within a day from the time it

was sent here. And I said we reached that conclusion. There

was controversy there over whether this man could have been

Mr. Dodd. Counsel, why do you not proceed?

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you describe the controversy that

you are referring to, Miss Goodpasture, over whether this

man was Oswald?.

Ms. Goodpasture. I felt that it was not Oswald.

MI. Goldsmith. When did you feel this? At the time

that the cable was sent?

Ms. Goodpasture. As soon as we got the description,

because I did not think this man, this photograph, could

possibly be the same man that was described here.

Mr. Goldsmith. What actions were taken at that point

to clarify the situation?

Ms. Goodpasture. I had an argument, I think, with the

Deputy Chief of Station, MI. Scott, over it. He said, oh,

that may be incorrect and so forth. But there was quibbling

over it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Going back to the cable that appears

on page 2, I am still not sure that I understand why the

photo was sent to headquarters. What indication did you

have that Oswald had been to the Cuban or Russian Embassy on

October Ist of 2nd of 1963?

The transcripts that we reviewed earlier gave no indica-

tion that he was going to be there on that day.

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

MI. Goldsmith. Gave no indication that Oswald was

going to be at the Russian or Cuban Embassy on October Ist

or 2nd.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right. But once this mistake

was made and this cable was sent, it was compounded, because

the cable was used as reference material, rather than

1 going

back to the log.

We did not get around to correcting that

date.

MI. Goldsmith. I understand that but, however, at the

time this cable was sent, it refers to an American male

entering the Soviet Embassy. on October ist and now we find

that it really was October 2nd., And apparently you checked

the production logs for October Ist and 2nd.

My question is; since the transcripts

gave no indication

that Oswald had been at the Embassy on October Ist or 2nd

why was this picture connected to Oswald?. You have no inde-

pendent information that Oswald had been to the Embassy on

October lst or 2nd?

Ms: Goodpasture. That is true, but we could not tell

from this conversation on the lst that he did not go there?

We also could not tell from our transcripts that he had left

the area and that there was a possibility that he had gone

MI. Goldsmith. You checked the photosurveillance

materials for approximately a four or five day period, is that

correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, I think it is.

Mr. Goldsmith. During that four of five day period

Oswald was the only -- not Oswald. This man was the only

non-Latin appearing man whose photograph you found, is that

correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that it was the only non-

Latin appearing person's photograph that we found that we

could not identify as somebody else. A lot of the people

who went to the Soviet Embassy all the time, we

came to know

who they were. After they had been identified, they made

frequent visits there.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to refer your attention

now to page 5.

Mr. Preyer. Counsel, may I speak to you for a moment?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Dodd. Miss Goodpasture, I

am checking on the time

remaining for questioning. Counsel indicates that he would

require something less than another hour. Is that right?

MI. Goldsmith., For purposes of clarification, the

reason that this particular photograph was selected was

because during the four or five day period in which the

photo productioniots were checked, this individual was the

only non-latin appearing male whom your personnel in the

Mexico City station were unable to identify, is' that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Drawing your attention to page 5 --

before we get into page 5, was Oswald's, or the person whom

you thought was Oswald, was his appearance at the Embassy

considered to be unusual or of any significant interest?

Ms. Goodpasture, Would you ask that question again?

I am not sure I understood.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was. thecfact that Oswald or the person

whom you identified as Oswald appeared at the embassies when

he did, was that considered unusual?

Ms. Goodpasture. No. Frequently there were callers,

it was just another one, another name that we might or might

at that time.

Ms • Goodpasture.

I was in Mexico so I would not really

know why he did it at headquarters.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand.

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Mr. Karamessinas' position was a

relatively high one in the CIA hierarchy, is that correct?

Ms • Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. This was a matter that was not considered

to be of particular significance, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. It was not significant to us at the

time that - before we

got the name trace. It may have been

considered significant here in Washington because it was

possibly because he was a former defector.

Mr. Goldsmith. I see. The Washington authorities may

have regarded this as significant and upon receipt of this

cable in Mexico City station, I believe you indicated before

that MI. Tarasoff apparently made a voice comparison of the

taped conversations. Is that correct?

Ms • Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. If headquarters considered this matter

to be significant, would they have been apprised of the

results of this voice comparison?

M8. Goldsmith. As a matter of routine procedure?

Ms. Goodpasture.

The voice comparison only indicated

that he called the Soviet embassy and the Cuban embassy.

We

had his name, a name, Oswald, in the traffic to the Soviet

embassy,

to start off with, and the only thing the voice

comparison did, it tied in that name, but we had no way of

identifying our caller exactly with the subject of this

trace.

MI. Goldsmith. Are you saying, then, that the fact

that Oswald, the fact that you were able to, by voice compari-

son, establish that he had been to the Cuban Embassy and the

Soviet Embassy was not significant?

Ms. Goodpasture, That is what we said in the note.

In the transcripts, he called the Soviet embassy from the

Cuban embassy, a man, and that voice by the Russian trans-

criber was identified as the same voice as the person who

said his name was Lee Oswald.

MI. Goldsmith. I understand that. But headquarters

was never apprised of that voice comparison?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think they were in a cable.

Mr. Goldsmith. Prior to the assassination? •

Ms. Goodpasture. No, I do not think they were prior

to the assassination.

Oswald was considered significantly significant. for Mr.

Karamessinas to be the releasing officer of the cable to the

Mexican station and a voice

comparison is made for the purpose

of determining essentially whether Oswald had been to both

the Cuban and the Soviet Embassy. According to your testi

mony, the results of that voice comparison were that in fact

it was the same person.

Are you saying that the fact that Oswald had been to

both the Cuban and the Russian embassy was not considered

sufficiently important to notify headquarters prior to the

assassination?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, because at that stage, we had no

way of proving that the man who made that call in Mexico was

the same man that this trace was about.

Mr. Goldsmith. The cable from headquarters gives back-

ground information on Mr. Oswald, does it not?

Ms• Goodpasture. Right..

We assumed that it probably was.

MI. Goldsmith. Right.

After receiving the cable, a voice comparison is made.

It is determined that the same person was talking on each

tape and there is no follow-up to headquarters, even though

headguarters clearly considered this to be significant?

Ms. Goodpasture. The follow-up was made by disseminat-

identify Oswald, trying to locate the man. That is the way

the follow up was made. We thought that he may still be in

Mr. Goldsmith. The point is, however, that upon the

making of a voice comparison, if, in fact, that was done,

that information was not communicated to anyone.

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know if it was or not.

You would have to check the file completely, the cable

traffic, to see if it was. Io the best of my knowledge, it

was not until after the assassination.

MI. Goldsmith. If it were not, would that be unusual?

MS. Goodpasture. NO.

MX: Goldsmith. Despite the fact that this was considered

something of significance by headquarters?

Ms. Goodpasture. Headquarters - no, because they

could not have done anything with the voice comparison.

Mx. Goldsmith. Perhaps they could not have done any

thing with the voice comparison, but they may have considered

it to be even more serious had they been informed that not

only had Oswald been to the Soviet Embassy but he also had

been to the Cuban Embassy-

Ms. Goodpasture. I think they knew that, because the

call from the Soviet Embassy came from the Cuban Embassy.

MI. Goldsmith. Your cable of October 3th, does that.

MI. Goldsmith.::

Your cable of October 8th, I am

referring now to page 2. Does that give any indication that

the call came from the Cuban Embassy?

Ms. Goodpasture. The first call was not made - no,

it does not.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, headquarters did not know

that he had been to the Cuban Embassy,

MS, Goodpasture. Pardon me?

MI. Goldsmith. In fact, headquarters did not know that

he had also been to the Cuban Embassy:

Ms. Goodpasture. At that point, no.

MI. Goldsmith. At least, according to your recollec-

tion, it was not until after the assassination that head-

quarters was informed of that fact.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is probably right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you ever spoken to Mr. Karasmes-

sinas about this matter?

Ms • Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you ever spoken to Mr. Karamessinas

about this matter?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, and I do not think that in

Mexico that we would have known that Tom Karamessinas signed

off on this cable, beause the cable that came down there did

not have the names of the people on them.

Mr. Goldsmith. There are other indications on the

cable as well that headquarters regarded this incident to be

significant, is that not true? The cable also contains other

indications that indicated that headquarters regarded this

matter to be significant, is that not true?

For example, in paragraph 4 -- I am referring now to

page 5 of Stack C, paragraph 4 -- it says, "Station should

pass info RIF (1) and it

gives cryptonyms of various govern-

mental agencies. Certainly that is an indication that

headquarters regarded this as significant.

Ms. Goodpasture. That Information was taken immediately

and all efforts were made to locate the man in Mexico, think-

ing that he was still there, but this cable. did not tell us

that he had come back to the states.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand. The only point I am

making here, this is a spearate indication that headquarters

regarded this to be a matter of significance, the fact that

they told you to pass along information to other people.

Ms • Goodpasture. That is right.

The Committee will stand in recess for five minutes.

(A brief recess was taken.)

MI. Dodd. At the time that we took the recess, and I

responded to a recorded vote, Counsel was proceeding with

questions. I would ask counsel to continue with those

questions.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you.

One question that was out of the line of my inquiry

that I was making prior to the recess, at the time that

the Oswald reco-ding was obtained, did you or anyone else

go to Boris Tarasoff and indicate to him that this was a matter

of special importance and needed to be transcribed immedi-

ately?

Ms. Goodpasture. The first tape with his voice on it,

I cannot remember whether or not I took that to Herb Minell

or whether the outside agent took it to Tarasoff, but it was

taken to Tarasoff at the same time that it came in from the

base:

Mr. Goldsmith. Was Tarasoff

given special instructions

that this particular recording was of unusual importance?

Ms: Goodpasture. I am quite sure that he was asked

to transcribe it imnediately®:

it immediately?

Ms. Goodpasture.. So they could find out whether there

was any information there under the name Lee Oswald. That

was the only transcription that he did except for a short

one from the Cuban Embassy staff.

Mr. Goldsmith. The first conversation that came in

involving Oswald apparently came in on September 27, that

he was not identified by name in that conversation.

Ms. Goodpasture. No, that is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was that tape taken to Tarasoff?

Is

that the one that he was asked to transcribe immediately?

Ms. Goodpasture. The one that he was asked to transcribe

immediately was the one that had the name on it.. The one

that was unidentified, it would also have been taken to him

as soon as it came off of the machine, and he would have been

asked to transcribe it as soon as he could.

MI. Goldsmith, I am not sure I follow you why there

was a need to transcribe it immediately.

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

MI. Goldsmith, Why was there a need to have him

transcribe it immediately?

Ms. Goodpasture.

The Lee Oswald one?

Mr. Goldsmith Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture. The conversation was in Russian, or

broken Russian, but it was in a language that the monitors

inside could not understand. They could not tell if the

man had a telephone number there or if he had an address

or if he gave more information in the Russian language than

his name

The only thing they got was his name, which I believe

was in English.

Mr. Goldsmith. Even so, why could they not have waited

for the ordinary lag time to ensure prior to the transcrip

tion of the recording?

Ms. Goodpasture. Wait a minute. We are talking about

two different things. The reason that he would have been

asked, Tarasoff would have been asked, to transcribe it

immediately would have been because we had a name connected

with it. Most of Tarasoff's transcription work was trans-

cribing Russian to English, but the conversations were with

persons who were in the Embassy, Soviet personnel, and in

that process he built up a backlog.

So if something came in that was not a Soviet or

something other than the people who we knew there talking,

he would have been asked to do that immediately before the

chit-chat conversation translations of people who were

living in the Embassy:

Now do you understand what I am talking about?

MI. Goldsmith, I think your explanation is responsive.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like, at this point, to refer

to page 6 of the documents contained in Stack C. In this

regard, can you identify this particular document?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, it is a cover sheet that woüld

go over a cable in the Mexico station files.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is this the cover sheet that went with

the cable that was received from headquarters which gave the

correct description of Oswald?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Probably on the llth of October.

That is the date stamped here.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, number

Ms. Goodpasture. That is

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mx. Goldsmith. How does it differ from the file on an

individual that is maintained at

Ms. Goodpasture. It is not any different at all. It

is the same type of file.

would everytng that is in the local file, the P file, be

reflected in the headquarters file on the individual?

Ms. Goodpasture. Not always. It should be, but some-

times formal communication was sent to headquarters that was

written from several notes. The formal communication, such

as the cable, would be in the headquarters files, but if some-

one had taken the information down from the conversation on a

table napkin, or something, and had not written a formal

memorandum for the file, the raw data would not be in the

headquarters file.

MI. Goldsmith. How long would it take to open a P

'file

locally?

Ms, Goodpasture. Depending on the workload, it should

not take longer than a day to take a file folder out of the

cabinet and put the material in and put a label on it. •

MI, Goldsmith. Is it likely that Oswald's P file

was open shortly after October 12, 1963?

Ms, Goodpasture. I would assume so.

MI. Goldsmith. Examining the statement in cursive

by Mr. Scott, it says, "Please set up P file on Lee Henry

Oswald and put all data that we have into it."" "All" is

underscored.

Do you have any explanation for why Mr. Scott would

have bothered to underscore "all"?

Ms. Goodpasture. He always did that.

You always had the feeling that your files were never

complete enough.

Mr. Goldsmith. If you examined another routing slip

would also, as a matter of routine, have the "all" under-

Mr. Goldsmith. To your knowledge, do you have any

Oswald's P file were not put into it?

Mr. Goldsmith. As a matter of routine, who would review

the cable upon receiving it in Mexico City?

Ms. Goodpasture. The first person to get all cable

traffic was the Chief of Station and the second person to get

it was Alan White. The third person to get it was usually

the person to whom it was routed to, that Mr. Scott wanted

to see it first.

title on it, also known as lee Henry Oswald. That is what

the "sic" designates, that it could be two names.

MI. Goldsmith. If that were the case, would not the

appropriate way to indicate that be by writing down "aka".

instead of "sic"

Ms. Goodpasture. "Aka" was also used.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, my impression is that the

term "sicl: is used as a matter of routine in the English

language to designate that the item that is referred to is

erronEOUS •

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not think he meant it in those

terms. I think he wanted both names to be on the file. He

is another world now and there is no way of finding out.

MI. Goldsmith. Understood.

In fact, the "sic" points right to the henry and in

fact Oswald's real name was Harvey not Herry, is that correct?

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith.: Did Winn Scott know that Oswald's middle

name was Harvey and not Henry?

Ms Goodpasture. Not to my knowledge. We had no record

of it at the Mexico station. We had no trace on anyone by

Oswald.

tant question

That is why, I think, that he must have wanted it so

that the file would show lee Oswald and also Lee Henry

Mr. Goldsmith. If the Committee wanted to verify whether

it was standard procedure for Mr. Scott to indicate that a file

should be opened under more than one name, for him to indi-

cate that by writing down the word "sic," I presume that all

we would have to do is to review cable traffic or routing

sheets to see if that was a matter of routine, he used that

terminology, "sic" is that not correct?

Ms • Goodpasture.

You could if you wanted.

MI. Goldsmith. If, in fact, it turned out that as a

matter of routine he did not use the terminology "sic" to

refer to the opening of a file under more than one name, that

might indicate, would it not, that scott was aware of Oswald's

true middle name?

Ms. Goodpasture. I would not

go so far as to suggest

that. You could assume that you thought that he knew, but

if he knew it, we certainly had no record of it to my knowledge

at the Mexico station.

Ms. Goodpasture. In the context of the way the name

Lee Oswald came to our attention the first time, it was in

such a way that we could not tell the man was saying his

name was Lee and Oswald, or whether his name was Lee Oswald.

Mr. Dodd, What notation was made in that reference

in the cable traffic when the transcripts - what notation is

in parentheses?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Dodd. What notation was in parentheses in the

transcripts of the telephone conversations? Does the word

phonetic, does that strike a bell

in parentheses, phonetic?

Ms. Goodpasture. Phonetic, Lee Oswald.

When the transcript was first brought to me, the man

outside, as I recall, said they do not know if this man is

Lee or whether it is Oswald.

Mx. Dodd. If they indicated they did not understand,

what did they put in parentheses?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Before the action was taken on the

transcript, was taken to the transcriber who prepared an

English translation and on the basis of his English trans-

lation they felti that, the person who prepared the cable

felt, that the name was Lee Oswald.

Ms: Goodpasture. They put phonetic.

took that recess, I do not want to belabor this point with

you.

How well did you know Mr. Scott?

Ms. Goodpasture. I did not make myself clear. What

I meant when I answered his question, I thought, I think,

that this refers to the fact that the fist lee Oswald that

we had was garbled.

Mr. Goldsmith. Where was that? What are you talking

about, on the transcripts or the conversation?

Ms, Goodpasture. From the transcripts, yes, sir.

And we had never seen the name printed and that I thought what

he meant that this lee Henry Oswald file should have in it

all the information that we had on the man with the name,

the garbled name, the Lee Oswald that had come up in the

transcripts:

answer the question truthfully.

MI, Dodd.:.

Let us go back a little bit and, counsel,

I will ask you to assist me on this, but in all of the trans-

cripts, was there any middle name or middle initial mentioned?

I do not recall seeing any.

Mr. Goldsmith. No, there was not.

MI. Dodd. That does not explain the letter or the

language "sic" by Henry, because they had never been any

reference to a Henry or a Harvey®

Ms. Goodpasture. That Henry, I think that was the

headquarters mistake. This cable originated in headquarters

that we are looking at and this is a copy of it as it was

received in Mexico.

The first time that we received the name on Oswald and

the traces it was Lee Henry, and it was later that it became

Lee Harvey

Mr. Dodd. We are getting away from my point. If it

were a question about using a different name as you have

properly described Aka, also known as, is the proper letter

to use in that kind of situation where a sic, as you have

properly defined it, describes an entirely different

situation.

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

MI. Dodd. My next question is, how well did you know

MI. Scott? Didyou know him well?

In other words; he does not indicate the file should

MI. Goldsmith. So really there is no basis at all for

thinking that the term "sic" indicates what Scott had in mind

was an "aka" is there? " There is no basis for reaching that

conclusion, is there?

Ms. Goodpasture. Would you repeat that again?

Mr, Goldsmith.

certainly

It is apparent from the routing indication on page 6

that Scott wanted the file opened on Lee Henry Oswald.

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. He gave no indication on the routing

slip that he wanted the file open up under the name Lee Henry

Oswald aka Lee Oswald. There is no indication that the file

was to be opened up under two names. In light of that, there

is really no basis, is there, for concluding that the use of

the phrase sic on page 7 refers to the term aka?

Ms. Goodpasture.

My interpretation that the use of

the word sic was for the lee Oswald, the first name in there

on page and that all of the information about that name

that we did not know the full name on would

go into the other

file,

Ms • Goodpasture. I feel that refers to the first

Lee Oswald in place of Lee Henry Oswald, the first line.

We

could argue that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is not the arrow pointed right over

and in between the "e" and "n'"in the word "Henry"?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right, but it is also pointing

right to the beginning of the lee Oswald name.

To answer your question, I do not know.

MI. Goldsmith. In any event, "sic" does not mean "aka"

does it?

Ms • Goodpasture:

That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Scott did not use those terms

interchangeably, did he?

Ms. Goodpasture., Did he

Mr. Goldsmith. Use the term "sic"

term "aka".

interchangeably? He did not, as a matter of

custom, do that, did he?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not recall having seen him use

aka that much at all. I have seen sic several times after a

name when there was no middle initial or where there was.

question about spelling.

Mr. Goldsmith. I do not believe that the answer was

responsive. Do you know whether he used the term "sic" and

"aka" interchangeably?

MS, Goodpasture. No, I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. What is your understanding of the term

"authenticating officer"? What does that term mean?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Someone who has the authority to sign

a cable, to release it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would an authenticating officer simply

sign a cable and release it, or is there anything that he

would do before signing?

Ms. Goodpasture. The releasing officer was a superior

officer.

MI, Goldsmith. It would be the responsibility of the

authenticating officer, would it not, to verify the accuracy

of the contents of the cable?

Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, that would be his responsibility.

MI. Goldsmith. Drawing your attention to the bottom of

page 22, please read the second paragraph.

It continues on

(Pause)

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Specifically, this seers to indicate

that the station is unable to compare the voice of the first

tape, which was erased pror to the receipt of the second call?

Is that true? Is that what the document indicates? 001276

MI. Goldsmith. Do you have any explanation for the

that there was a voice comparison made?

Ms, Goodpasture. The only explanation that I can make

is that the Soviet transcriber made it on the basis of not

listening to the two tapes again over, but on his memory of

yes, that is the same man that I listened to and transcribed

the tape fron the Soviet Embassy, the man who called himself

Lee Oswald.

MI. Dodd, Counsel, I do not want to interrupt you.

Mrs. Goodpasture, you worked a long time in that Embassy,

you are very familiar with technical terms and terminology

that are used.

Now, when you are doing a voice comparison and what

all of that means, a voice comparison, that is a rather

technical description of something, and you just stated a

minute ago that a voice comparison was made. I would assume

by that that you are telling this Committee - and we are

grateful that you are here, we appreciate your testimony.

We have a very difficult job in front of us. We are trying

to get to the botton of this whole story, and you are making

it difficult.

I do not like to have to tell you that, but you are. You

are using the term "voice comparison" and you are indicating

to this committee that there was analysis made of a person's

voice, not the memory of a transcriber. It is a technical job.

It is not something that you leave to somebody who is merely

a translator, and you just finished telling us that a voice

comparison was made. Your own memorandum there on page 21

says that, in fact, one could not have been made.

What is the truth here?

Ms, Goodpasture. I think that what happened was that

the voice comparison, by taking the two tapes, I think the

tape. had been destroyed,

Based on my memory now --

MI. Dodd.

What you just said a minute ago

Ms. Goodpasture. To tell you the truth, I do not

remember.

Mr. Dodd. What you just said a moment ago is not

true, then, that there is not a voice comparison?

Ms, Goodpasture, What I said a moment ago was based on

a note that had been made in the files, that the transcriber

hadicompared the voices, and this note was written 14 years

ago.

23

21

25

Mr. Dodd. Based upon your working knowledge of the

terminology of voice comparison, does that normally involve

listening to two tapes with someone who is technically trained

to make a determination as to whether of not the voices on two

different tapes are one and the same person?

Ms. Goodpasture. The way it was used, to me it would

also mean that a person who had listened to two tapes at

different times and said that they were the same, that it

would be a comparison by him.

Mr. Dodd. That was considered a bona fide voice

comparison?

Ms. Goodpasture. Not in the technical sense that you

are referring to.

You are correct.

MI. Dodd. Counsel, you may proceed. I am awfully

confused about your statement.

Ms• Goodpasture. I apologize for that. It is a con

fusion tame of so much material at one time, going over it

and the details of it. But I honestly do not remember being

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that I made the notation within

about a week or ten days after the date of the newspaper

article, because this was a Washington article and it would

have been sent to us in Mexico through a pouch.

Which is true?

Ms. Goodpasture.

The notation was made in 1964 on this

newspaper article. I think that I was referring to the trans-

criber, Mr. Tarasoff's, identifying the man as having made

both calls in listening to the tapes.

Mi. Dodd. Why did you not make that same observation

on 23. November 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. That was a mistake I made that I should

not have made. I should have stated it exactly as it occurred

so we would not be in doubt now. But I do not know.

Mr. Dodd.

So the statement made on 23 November '63 is

inaccurate?

Ms. Goodpasture.

To the best of my knowledge, it is.

I am sure I could not locate the tapes, or I would not have

put that in the cable.

In this regard, I would like to refer to Stack B, the

1. This is a transcription of a conversation involving

Oswald that took place on 1 October 1963.

By the line which immediately follows the number 151

in brackets it says "the same person who phoned a day or so

ago and spoke in broken Russian."

in fact, had visited

the Cuban Embassy earlier?

Ms. Coodpasture: Would you repeat that again, please?

Mr. Goldsmith. Viewing these two documents together,

the last paragraph of the article, the language in brackets,

it says, "The same person who phoned a day or so ago and

spoke in broken Russian."

Does it not become apparent that Oswald, in fact, had

visited the Cuban Embassy earlier?

I admit that is not a direct inference that can be

drawn, but if you follow the transcripts, if you go back to

the preceding Saturday and you review the transcripts from

that day, it becomes apparent that Oswald had been at the Cuban

Embassy on Saturday. The point that I am getting at is that

independent of these documents here, it would seem that a

voice comparison, in fact, would have to. have been made.

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that he recognized the voice

from having listened to a tape ofithe Cuban

Embassy that had

Russian on it but did not have a name, instead of just

listening to two tapes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Going back to page 22 of Stack C it

says, "station unable to compare voice as first tape erased

prior receipt second call."

Does that suggest to you at at the time that this cable

was sent the second tape wasastill in existence? It says

one tape was destroyed or erased; the second one ias not.

two tapes we are talking about.

Ms. Goodpasture. YOu said what about the second tape.

This seems to suggest that while the first tape had

been erased, the second tape has not been erased.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This cable is dated November 23, 1963.

What happened to the tape that was in existence on November

23, 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not think that it was still in

existence in November, 1963 but I think that it still was in

existence wien the tape from the second call cane back to us.

But the first one, we discovered, had been erased.

Mr. Goldsmith. This says, "station unable to compare

does not the cable say instead --

Ms. Goodpasture. They both were erased. I do not know.

in fact, was found.

Ms. Goodpasture. Would you repeat that, please?

tape. You said that you were unable to find the first tape.

That, again, suggests that the second tape was found.

the original transcripts, but I could not find the tapes that

had those calls.

September 27 and October 1, 1963, is that correct?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms • Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. The first call came in, as it turns

out, September 27th. The last call that was attributed to

Oswald came in October Ist. So we have a timespan here of five

inconsistency?

Ms. Goodpasture, The only explanation is the one I made

previously, is that the two tapes were still not available at

that time to compare and we had to take the transcriber's

word for it.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would also like to point out that

paragraph 2, the very last line, the first two words, it says

"probably Oswald." Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Page 22?

Mr. Goldsmith. Page 22, the second paragraph, the last

line, it says "probably Oswald."

Ms Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. This cable is Mexico 7023.

Then, two cables later, 7025, the fourth paragraph, it

says

who did transcriptions, says

Oswald is identical. We no longer have any words of qualifica-

tions.

I am referring now to page 29, paragraph 4.

What page is the other one?

Mr. Goldsmith.: Page 29, paragraph 4. It says,

who did transcription, says Oswald is identical. The earlier

cable says, "probably Oswald. Unable to compare voice as

first tape erased prior to receipt of the second."

Two cables later, it says that

says Oswald is

identical with the person speaking broken Russian who called

Ms. Goodpasture.' The only explanation I can give is

that we went over the files again and we found the references

that the transcriber had made, the statements that he had

made, that it was the same person. Oh, MI. Minell could have

gone out and talked with him.

In your interview with Mr. Minell, I am sure that he

would remember if he did.

Mr. Dodd. Let me interrupt for one second.

Miss Goodpasture, at the time that you were sitting down

and having discussions over these November 23 -- over this

23 November, 1963, when you were sitting down and comparing

these two memorandum; was MI. Tarasoff ever present in the

preparation of these memos?

Ms.: Goodpasture. Did MI. Tarasoff ever --

Mx. Dodd. Was he present during the preparations of

these memos and these discussions you were having?

Ms. Goodpasture. You mean this one?

MI. Dodd. I am talking about page 22, the memorandum

on which you were the authorizing officer, the memorandum

involving paragraph 4 on page 29 where

that Oswald is identical.

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

The reason was that he was located outside of the

Embassy and these were not taken outside.

Mr. Dodd. Did you ever personally speak to Mr. Tarasoff?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, I have spoken to him personally.

Mr. Dodd. Did you speak to him at the time?

Ms. Goodpasture. No. I was not in touch with him at

this time?

MI. Dodd. Did you speak to him - how did you know he

compared the voices?

Ms • Goodpasture. Pardon me?

MI: Dodd:

How do you know he compared the voices if

you did not speak to him?

Ms • Goodpasture.:

I took it from this transcript, I

think, from a statement made here that he typed himself, the

P 1-B is a copy of a transcript prepared by Tarasoff, on his

typewriter.

MI. Dodd. Let us suspend for a second.

(Pause)

Go ahead.

Mr, Goldsmith. Probably you will not believe this.

I

only have a few more questions.

Turning to page 30 of the documents in Stack C, this

is a duplicate of Mexico number 7025, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith.

This is the same cable that in paragraph

4 makes a reference to

saying that Oswald is identi-

cal with the person who spoke broken Russian involved in the

Cuban Embassy on September 28th, is that correct?

'Ms. Goodpasture. Wait a minute, I am not following you,

page 30?

Mr. Goldsmith. Turn to page 30. That is a duplicate

of 7025. That is the Mexico copy of 7025.

Ms: Goodpasture. Mexico 7025, right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This is your copy, the one that you

referred to earlier?

On page 28 and 29 was the copy that

went to headquarters, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine. We are talking about the same

cable now. In each case, paragraph 4 makes the same reference

to Oswald's being identical, et cetera, et cetera. Who was

the authenticating officer, page 32, I believe.

Ms. Goodpasture. I am.

Mr. Goldsmith. Turning back to page 23, which refers

to Mexico 7023,lwho is the authenticating officer of that

cable?

Ms. Goodpasture. I am.

Mr. Goldsmith. Yet, in the first cable, you say

"probably. Oswald. Station unable compare voice as first tape

erased prior receipt second call.". And in the second cable

you state, "Oswald is identical," without any lanquage of

qualification.

Ms. Goodpasture. I said that the transcriber said he

was identical, right?

Mr. Goldsmith. Did anything happen?

Ms. Goodpasture, In the other one, we were unable to

have the tapes for someone else to compare them, for other

people to listen to them or to send them to headquarters for

them tolisten to then, but we did have on record from this

transcript that he had prepared that Tarasoff said that the

calls were made by the same man.

MI. Goldsmith. You have no explanation for why the

Oswald tapes would have been erased within six days of their

receipt by the Mexico City station as opposed to within the

normal two-week period.

Ms, Goodpasture. No, I cannot explain it.

MI. Goldsmith. One final question. Have you discussed

the testimony that you have given us today, have you discussed

that with anyone prior to coming here today?

Ms. Goodpasture. Have I discussed the testimony?

MI. Goldsmith.:

Have you discussed the nature of your

testimony with anyone prior to your coming here today?

Ms. Goodpasture. The only discussion I had was a

confusion about my coming up, which I discussed when I

arrived, and there was a misunderstanding of my being brought

up here.

Mr. Goldsmith.

I am aware of that.

Have you discussed the substance of your testimony with

anybody, or what you thought would be your testimony with

anyone?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, I have not talked with anyone since

I left here yesterday:

Mr. Goldsmith.

Since you left the Committee's offices

yesterday, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

•I left your office

yesterday.

Mr. Goldsmith. I have nothing further.. Thank you

very much

Mr. Chairman?

Mr. Dodd. MI. Preyer, do you have any questions?

MI. Preyer: I have no further questions at this time.

MI. Dodd. Mrs. Goodpasture, first of all, I would like

to request of you that you leave your address or addresses

with the Legislative Counsel of the CIA from time to time.

so if we feel a need to

get back in touch with you, we can

contact them and they can locate you for us, If you would

do that, I would appreciate it.

Secondly, I want you to know that we are grateful to

you for appearing before your Committee. You have been help

ful and we are grateful to you for that.:

I want to apologize to you if I seemed to be a little

abrasive on that one point, which is that we are trying to

get to the truth of this as quickly as we can. Under our

rules of this Committee, we give each witness an opportunity

at the conclusion of their testimony to take five minutes and

sum up or add any additional information that you feel might

be helpful to this Committee or to correct what you may feel

are any inconsistencies or confusion over testimony that you

have given this committee, and I will ask you now to take

advantage, if you would so desire, of five minutes or so to

make that summation.

Ms, Goodpasture. The only thing that I could think of

right now is that I feel that some of the papers here are

probably out of context and still have some errors in them,

and those errors that come up, I am sure they are human

errors and there may be more of them.

I know. in this one draft of background material, I just

guessed at the dates when people were there as well as names,

as well as much of the information about the situation in

Mexico at that time, because it was to be used as a framework

for trying to pull together the documents that would be needed

to present a true picture of what the agency had in their

files or the situation that was there at that time.

That is about all I car think of now.

Mr. Dodd.

Thank you.

All right, Miss Goodpasture, you are excused as a

witness. Again, on behalf of the Committee, I express my

gratitude to you.

Mr: Preyer. I want to congratulate you on your stamina

Miss Goodpasture:

Mr. Dodd. Unless there is any further business before

this Subcommittee, we will stand in recess until further

call of the Chair.
