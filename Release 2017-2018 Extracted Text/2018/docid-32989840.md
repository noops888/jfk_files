Dear Senator Ingram:

In regard to your letter of December 16, 1977,
wherein you invited me to testify before your Committee
in order to discuss the operation of the FBI within this
state, it will be impossible for me to appear with only
two days' notice as the schedule of the supervisors in
this office is generally defined many weeks in advance
of those dates.

Should you be able to inform us of a permanent date

and time with a minimum of four weeks" notice, we would be
delighted to attend and testify as to the FBI

Jackson, Mississippi 39205

Dear Mr. Murray:

The Judiciary Committee of the Mississippi State Senate will conduct
hearings on the criminal law enforcement agencies and the courts in the State
of Mississippi during the 1978 Regular Session. Generally, the committee
would like to undertake a comprehensive review of theofficials and agencies
within the criminal justice system.

The committee realizes that the role played by the various criminal law
enforcement agencies of the federal government in the state of Mississippi is
a significant one. The committee would appreciate you or your representative
appearing before the committee and disucssing the operation of your agency
within the state. The committee would be particularly interested in the ways
in which Mississippi courts and law enforcement agencies may better cooperate
with your office.

These hearings are not being directed toward the enactment of any parti-
cualr legislation; rather, they are being conducted for the committee's infor-
mation. However, the hearings may result in future criminal justice legislation.

The committee hopes that these hearings can begin during the second week
of the session, January 9-13. Due to the hectic and variable legislative
schedules, we cannot, at this time, give you an exact date and time when we
would like for you to appear. However, we will telephone you as soon as we
have an opening for the scheduling of hearings. Unfortunately, we ene
to give you only two days' notice, but we will make every effort to. Be.

(B) FBI PROFESSIONAL.LIABILIFY-INSU ‘E.PLAN -- The first
anniversary of the implementation of the SA/[I Professional Liability
Insurance Plan will occur on April 1, 1977 This insurance provides
protection for Agents and other Bureau personnel in the event their
official actions result in a law suit for actual damages which are not
covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act or punitive damages. Payment
of legal fees is also included among the provisions of the plan.

Renewal notices will be mailed to current subscribers during
the first week of March, 1977. This advance reminder should allow
members ample time to make certain this important coverage does not
lapse between payment of premiums.

The plan itself is unique in the insurance industry and was
created specifically for personnel of the FBI. It is to be noted that in
view of the highly successful claim experience during the first year of
operation, the underwriters of the program have agreed to increase the
limit of liability for all participants from the current $50, 000 to $60, 000
effective April 1, 1977, and at no additional premium charge. This is
realistic and worthwhile protection and in view of the trend to sue
individuals engaged in law enforcement activities I encourage all
employees and more particularly investigative personnel to thoroughly
examine the provisions of the policy for possible application to them-
selves and their official responsibilities.

Employees having this coverage are reminded that it is their
personal responsibility to directly notify the carrier as to the receipt of
process ina suit directed against them for an act taking place after
the effective date of coverage. A supply of applications and specimen
policies will be furnished, under separate cover, to all FBI Field Offices
and Headquarters Divisions.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

August 24, 1976
MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE: ( )/

yo? igo

p!
(A) DISCOVERY IN CIVIL LITIGATION -- Present and former Bureau
employees, as well as the United States Government, are defendants in
numerous civil suits, and a number of FBI employees have expressed concern
regarding the extent to which courts are requiring us to produce documents in
these suits. Questions have been raised regarding the scope of discovery in
civil litigation, the means by which discovery can be resisted, and the extent
to which executive privilege can be invoked.

For your information, Rule 26 (b) (1), Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, provides as follows regarding the scope of discovery:

Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter,
not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the
claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the
claim or defense of any other party, including the exist-
ence, description, nature, custody, condition and location
of books, documents, or other tangible things and the
identity and location of persons having knowledge of any
discoverable matter. It is not ground for-objection that
the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if
the information sought appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

This rule "apparently envisions generally unrestrictive access to
sources of information, and the courts have so interpreted it."' Horizons
Titanium Corp. v. Norton Co., 290 F.2d 421, 425; Harris v. Nelson, 394
U. S, 286, 297.

To understand the reason for the wide scope of discovery permitted
by the Federal rules, it should be kept in mind that a clear distinction is made
between the right to obtain information by discovery and the right to use it at
the trial. Rule 26 (b) allows great freedom in discovery. Rules 32 (a), 33 (b),
and the rules of evidence generally limit what may be used at the trial.

® e
,

The Supreme Court spoke of the proper scope of the discovery
rules in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U. S. 495:

We agree, of course, that the deposition-
discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and
liberal treatment. No longer can the time-
honored cry of "fishing expedition" serve to
preclude a party from inquiring into the facts
underlying his opponent's case. Mutual knowledge
of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is
essential to proper litigation. To that end, either
party may compel the other to disgorge whatever
facts he has in his possession. The deposition-
discovery procedure simply advances the stage at
which the disclosure can be compelled from the
time of trial to the period preceding it, thus reducing
the possibility of surprise. Id. at 507-508.

The discovery rules apply to the United States just as fully as
they apply to any other person. U. S. v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U. S.
677, 681. It is also true that, like other litigants and witnesses, the United
States--and other Governmental units--frequently resists discovery. There
are more grounds on which to do so than when discovery is sought against
private persons. The United States has, or has claimed, among others:
(1) a privilege not to disclose the identity of informers; (2) a privilege for
military or state secrets; and (3) a qualified constitutional privilege to
refuse to disclose whatever the executive chooses to keep secret. Privilege
may be invoked only by the head of the Executive agency, i.e., the Attorney
General.

What is usually referred to as the informer's privilege is in
reality the Government's privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity
of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged
with enforcement of that law. Roviaro v. U. S., 353 U. S. 53, 59. Such
a privilege is well recognized. "The privilege for communications by
informers to the Government is well established and its soundness cannot
be questioned. '' Mitchell v. Roma, 265 F.2d 633, 635. Indeed, it has been
extended beyond those who give information to law enforcement officers to
include others who render assistance that is necessary to effective law
enforcement. Black v. Sheraton Corp. of America, 47 F.R.D. 263, 265.

8-24-76
MEMORANDUM 36-76 -2-

NW 55275 DocId:32989840 Page 17



. @ @

The privilege is a qualified one, however, and requires balancing the public
interest in protecting the flow of information and assistance to the enforce-
ment authorities against a party's right to prepare his case. Roviaro v. U. S.,
353 U. S. at 62.

It is only the identity of the informer that is protected. The
contents of his communication are not privileged (Roviaro v. U. S., 353 U. S.
at 50; Foltz v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 189 F.2d 537, 539-540,
certiorari denied 342 U. S. 871) unless they would tend to reveal his identity.
Wirtz v. Robinson and Stephens, Inc., 368 F.2d 114; Black v. Sheraton Corp.
of America, 47 F, R. D. at 269. The privilege belongs to the Government,
but it is waived if either the informer or the Government has disclosed his
identity (emphasis added). Mitchell v. Bass, 252 F.2d 513.

There is also a privilege for state secrets that protects
information not officially disclosed to the public concerning the national
defense or the international relations of the United States. McCormick,
Evidence, 1954, Section 144. U. S. v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1. The
Supreme Court in Reynolds, supra, rejected contentions that the decision
of the Executive is final as to the existence of this privilege. A court itself
must determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim.

In each case, the showing of necessity which
is made will determine how far the court should
probe in satisfying itself that the occasion for
invoking the privilege is appropriate. Where there
is a strong showing of necessity, the claim of
privilege should not be lightly accepted, but even the
most compelling necessity cannot overcome the claim
of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that
military secrets are at stake. A fortiori, where
necessity is dubious, a formal claim of privilege,
made under the circumstances of this case, will have
to prevail. Id. at 11.

There was also the contention, until United States v. Nixon,
418 U. S. 683 (1974) was decided, that by virtue of the separation of powers
in the Federal Government the Executive has an absolute privilege to with-
hold from Congress or the courts any information that the executive branch

8-24-76
MEMORANDUM 36-76 -3-

NW 55275 Docld:32989840 Page 18



NW 55275

deems confidential. This contention goes back as far as Marbury v. Madison,
1803, 1 Cranch (5 U. S.) 187, 144, and the trial of Aaron Burr. U.S. v. Burr,
25 Fed. Cas. 187, 190, No. 14, 694.

Recent lower court cases, as well as the Nixon case, recognized
a qualified executive privilege, well-described in the following passage:

In asserting the privilege, the Government
cites no authority to establish the privilege as an
absolute one. In fact, the cases make it clear that
the privilege is a discretionary one that depends
upon ad hoc considerations of competing policy
claims, the policy of free and open discovery
juxtaposed to the need for secrecy to insure candid
expression of opinions by Government employees in
the formulation of Government policy. * * * Thus,
when the privilege is claimed, it is necessary to
balance interests to determine whether disclosure
would be more injurious to the consultative functions
of Government than non-disclosure would be to the
private litigant's defense. U. 8. v. 30 Jars, More
or Less, of "Ahead Hair Restorer for New Hair
Growth, '"43 F. R. D. 181, 190.

Applying a process of this kind, courts in many cases have
sustained claims of executive privilege. In cases in which the litigant's
need for the information has seemed to outweigh the Government's interest
in secrecy, however, the claim of privilege has been overruled, and
disclosure has been ordered.

A discovery order, not being a "final" order, is not appealable,
put a party may attempt to obtain relief by applying to the court of appeals
for a writ of mandamus. To obtain such a writ, however, the petitioner
must show that the trial court has substantially abused its discretion. Be-
cause Rule 26 (b) (1) envisions generally unrestrictive access to information
and because a trial court has extremely broad discretion in this area, such
a writ is extremely difficult to obtain.

8-24-76
MEMORANDUM 36-76 -4-

DocId:32989840 Page 19



7 @ r

Refusal of a Government officer to comply with a court order
overruling a claim of executive privilege and ordering disclosure could
lead to conviction for contempt. If the Government is a party, the court
may penalize it for its failure to comply with a discovery order by
invoking any of the sanctions set forth in Rule 37 (b) (2), Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. The court may, for example, prohibit the disobedient
party from introducing designated matters in evidence, or it may enter a
judgment by default against the disobedient party.

the Honorable Clarence M..Kelley, the Director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importance
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather

than on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light

in our hearings occurred years and even decades before Director

Kelley took charge. ~.

The staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli-+
gence operations,’ and less on purely domestic surveillance.

The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.
“Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the eocavel of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-|
lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certain
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance techniques
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
‘in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.

The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY,

DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and
gentlemen.

I welcome the interest which this Committee has shown in
the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli
gence and internal security fields.

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis4
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.

This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as -
possible in responding to your questions and complying with your

requests.

I believe we have livea up to those promises.

The members and staff of this Committee have had unprece-
dented access to FBI information.

You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-type|
investigations and who are Sealy involved in every facet
of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who
have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with
all major areas of our activities and operations in the national
security and intelligence fields.

In brief, you have had firsthand examination of these
matters that is unmatched at any time in the history of the
Congress.

As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of
necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I
eredit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's
record of performance.

It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus
on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
organization.

The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the
lion's share of public attention and crjtical comment constituted
an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's Counterintelligence
Programs has reported that in the five basic a it- found
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,

less than three fourths, were approved.

I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were
being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era
when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative
matters per year.

Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate
and understandable.

The question might well be asked what I had in mind when
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..

What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is
that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what they
felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney Generdl,
the Congress, and the people of the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such

acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,
and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights. E

There were many calls for action from Members of Congress
and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and oth
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to countér conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may well
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet

an imminent threat: to human life .or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing'is to be carried
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by investigatin
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the
ability to prevent? I refer to those instances where there is
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to
human life.

Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt,
the Congress must consider the question of whether or not such
preventive action should be available to the FBI.

These matters are currently being addressed by a task
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI,
and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls can
be developed in cooperation with pertinent Committees of Congress
to insure that such measures are used in an entirely responsible
manner.

Probably the most important: question here today is what -
TS I can give that the errors and abuses which arose
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub-
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as
Director on July 9, 1973.

Today we place a high premium on openness, openness

both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion

in the decision-making process which insures that no future
program or major policy decision will ever be adopted without a
full and critical review of its propriéty.

Participatory management has become a fact in the FBI.

I have made it known throughout our Headquarters and
Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, ean of
position or degree of experience, to contribute their thoughts
and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms or
reservations they may have concerning any area of our. operations.

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. My goal is to achieve maximum
critical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure.

The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, “as a ‘lightning rod' to deflect improper requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,

considering the context of the request, I believed presented

the appearances of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I have to the
Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years a
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no |
one has approached me or made overtures, directly or otherwise,
to use the FBI for partisan political or other improper
purposes.

I can assure you that I would not for a moment consider
honoring any such request.

I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI
I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney General and
the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including
those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and|
practices, These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means..

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the
character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

I am-proud of the 19,000 men and women with whom it is

my honor to serve today. Their dedication, their professionalijsm,

their standards, and the self-discipline which they personally

demand of themselves and expect of their associates are the
nation's ultimate assurance of proper and responsible conduct
at all times by the FBI.

The Congress and the members of this Committee in
particular have gained a great insight into. the. problems
confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields,
problems which all too often we have left to resolve without
sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or the Congress
itself.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even
to the Executive Branch.

The Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised.

An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully
committed to maximum participation with, the members of that
Subcommittee.

I laud their efforts. However, those efforts are of very
recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.

One of the greatest benefits of the study this Committee
has made is the expert knowledge you have gained of the complex

problems confronting the FBI. But I respectfully submit that

those benefits are wasted if they do not lead to the next step,
a step that I believe is absolutely essential , a legislative
charter, expressing Congressional determination of intelligence
jurisdiction for the FBI.

Action to resolve the problems confronting us in the

security and intelligence fields is urgently needed; and it

must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither the Cangress

nor the public can afford to look the other way, leaving it to
the FBI to do what must be done, as too often has occurred in
the past.

This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of
our performance.

I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative
process and, thereby, would take over what historically have
been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast
them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con-
gressional oversight or Executive decision.

The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable determination

of our jurisdiction in the intelligence field, a jurisdictional
statement that the Congress finds to be responsive to both
the will and the needs of the American people.

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police officer, a
career police officer. In‘’my police experience, the must
frustrating of all problems that I have discovered facing
law enforcement in this country, Federal, state, and local, is
when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.

It mast: be sufficiently flexible that it does not stifle
the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly ‘address the demonstrated problems of the past;
yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times change and

so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive

The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced
the formulation of operational guidelines governing our
intelligence activities does not in any manner diminish the need
for legislation. The responsibility for conferring juris-
diction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals which

question the need for intelligence gathering, “suggesting that
information needed for the prevention of olencd can be
acquired in the normal course of criminal ‘investigations,

Asa practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence
for prosecution. Since the investigation normally follows
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well A
not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government: has enough information to meet any future crisis
or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on

our anticipation of those criminal acts. Anticipation,

in turn, is dependent on advance information, that is, intelli-
gence.

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues,
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need
for intelligence work can be documented to the full satisfaction
of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is nat
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee or
its successors in this important task.

In any event, you have my unqualified assurance as
Director that we will carry out both the letter and the spirit
of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

That is the substance of my prepared statement.

I would also like to say extemporaneously that I note
that on this panel are some gentlemen who were on the Judiciary
Committee Which heard my testimony at the time I was presented
to them for candidacy as Director of the FBI. At that time
I took very seriously the charge which may possibly result
in the deliberation of this Committee and of the full Senate.
I have been well aware of the problems of the FBI since that
time. I have also been well aware of the capabilities of

the FBI to discharge those responsibilities. I don't take

them lightly. I am of sufficient experience and age ‘that I
have pledged myself to do what is good and proper. I say this
not as a self-serving statement but in order that we might
place in context my position within the FBI. I could seek
sanctuary and perhaps a safe sanctuary by saying during the
period these things occurred I was with the local police ©
department in Kansas City, Missouri. Prior to that time,
however, I was in the FBI.

During the time I was with the FBI, during the time I
was with the police department, I continued ja sale OSI that
period a close acquaintance with and a strong affection for
the FBI.

I only want to point out that based on those years, based
on those observations, we have here a very fine and very
sensitive and a very capable organization. I feel that there
is much that can still be done. I know that we are not without
fault. I know that from those experiences I have had. .We
will not be completely without fault in the future. But I
assure you that we look upon this inquiry, we look upon any
mandate which you may feel you have, that you should look at -;7
this is good and proper, and we do not intend -- I only want
to place in your thinking the fact that you have here a
matchless organization, one which I continue to say was
not motivated in some of these instances, and in most of

them, and I cannot justify some, that the motivation was of the

Senator Hart of Michigan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Mathias and I have Judiciary Committee hearings at 10:30.

Iahve several questions, and I'm sure they'll be

reading your testimony and listening to it this morning, and
it relates to your comment at the foot of Begetra and at the
top of ll.

There you are indicating that you caution us about
extending the court's role in the early stages of investigations
suggesting that this might take us beyound the role comtemplatefi
for the courts under the Constutution.

Now as you have said, aside from the so-called national
security wiretap problem, the main focus of our discussions
and concern has been on the possibility requiring court
approval for the use of informants, informants directed to
penetrate and report on some group.

And one of the witnesses yesterday, Professor Dorsen,
pointed our that really those informants are the most pervasive
type of an eavesdropping device. It is a human device. It's
really, an informant is really more intrusive on my privacy
than a bug or a tap because he can follow me anywhere. He
can ask me questions to get information the government would
like to have.

Now we certainly involve the courts in approval of the

wiretaps for physical searches with the intent of the drafters

of the Constitution to have a- neutral third party magistrate
screen use of certain investigative techniques. And the
informant is such a technique. He functions sort of like a
general warrant, and I don't see why requiring court approval
would violate the role envisaged for the courts.

And as I leave, I would like to get ae reactions ne
my feelings.

Mr. Kelley. I do not feel that there is any use of the
informant in intrusion, which is to this extent objectionable.
It has of course been approved, the concept of the informant,
by numerous court decisions.

Let us go down not to the moral connotation of the use
of the informant.

I think, as in many cases, that is a matter of balance.
You have only very few ways of solving crimes. You have
basically in the use of the informant, I think, the protectian
of the right of the victim to be victimized. You have within
the Constitution certain grants that are under ordinary
circumstances abrogation of rights. The right of search and
seizure, which, of course, can't be unreasonable, but none-
theless, you have “the right.

I think that were we to lose the right of the informant,
we would lose to a great measure our capability of. doing our
job.

Now I'm not arguing with you, Senator, that it is not an

unusual procedure. I'm not even going to say that it is not
an intrusion, because it is. But it has to Be one I think
that is by virtue of the benefits must be counted.

We don't like to use it. We don't like the problems that
are attendant. We take great care.

Now you say about the court having possibility taking
jurisdiction over them and guiding. I think that possibly we
could present the matter to the court but what are they going
to do insofar as monitoring their effort? Are they going to
have to follow it all the way through?

Also, there is, of ire; urgency in the other contacts,
Must the court be contacted for each and approval of the court
given for each contact? |

There are a great many problems insofar as administration
of it.

I frankly feel, and again, all I can do is give you my
idea -- I frankly feel that there is a satisfactory control ovez
the informants as we now exercise it today. Yes, there are
going to be some who will get beyond our eer but this
is going to happen no matter what you do.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I appreciate your
reaction,

I was not suggesting that there is consideration here ‘to
prohibit informants. I was reflecting a view that I felt and

hold that the use of an informant does require some balance, as

you yourself said, and I would be more comfortable with a_

warranted by the particular circumstance. But I do understand
‘your position.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hart.

(Senator Hart leaves the hearing room.)

The Chairman, Senator Baker, do you have questions?

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

Mr. Kelley, I have a great respect for you and your
organization and I personally regret that the organization is
in political distress, hut we've both got to recognize that
it is, along with other agencies and departments of the
government,

I think you probably would agree with me that even though
that is extraordinarily unpleasant and in many respects
unfortunate, that it also has a plus side. That is, it gives
us an indication of our future direction and the opportunity,
at least, to improve the level of competency and service of
the government itself.

With that hopeful “note, would you be agreeable then to
volunteering for me any suggestions you have on how to improve
the responsiveness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or
indeed, for any other law enforcement agencies of the government

to the Congress, to the Attorney General, to the President, and

beyond that, would you give me any suggestions you have on

how you would provide the methods, the access, the documents,
the records, the authority, for the Congress to perform its
essential, I believe, essential oversight responsibility to
see that these functions, these delicate functions are being
undertaken properly?

And before you answer, let me tell you two or three thing
I am concerned about.

It hasn't been long ago that the FBI Director was not
even confirmed by the Senate of the United States. I believe
you are the first one to be confirmed hy the Senate of the
United States. I think that is a movement in the right
direction. I think the FBI has taken on a stature that, an
additional importance that requires it to have closer supervisipn
and scrutiny by us.

At the same time I rather doubt that we can become
involved in the daily relatianship between you and the Attorney
General.

Therefore, I tend to believe that the Attorney General
needs to be more directly involved in the operations of the
FBI.

I-would appreciate any comments on that.

Second, I rather believe that major decisions of the
intelligence community and the FBI ought to be in writing, so

that the Congress can, if it needs to in the future, take a

look at these decisions and the process by which they were
made to decide that you are or you are not pee toruine your
services diligently.

I don't think you can have oversight unless you have
access to records, and in many cases records don't exist
and in some cases the people who made those decisions are now
departed and in other cases you have conflicts.

How would you suggest: then that you improve the quality
of service of your agency? How would you propose that you
increase the opportunity for oversight of the Congress of the
United States? What other suggestions do you have for improving
the level of law enforcement in the essential activity that
is required?

Mr. Kelley. I would possibly be repetitious in answering
this Senator, but I get a great deal of pleasure from telling
what I think ‘ necessary and what I hope that I have followed,
one which is beyond my control, but which I think is very
important is that the position of Director, the one to which
great attention should be paid in choosing the man who will
properly acquit himself.

i I feel that the Judiciary Committee, at least in going
over me, did a pretty good job. I feel that it is most
necessary that care be taken that his philosophy, his means
of management, his facility to adapt to change, his tendency

toward consulting with other members of the official family,

g
i 2 | no reticence, and that I think that he should be chosen very
g c :
2 3 carefully.

4 I think further that he should be responsible for those
5 matters which indicate impropriety or illegality.

6 Senator Baker. Could you stop for just a second? Who
7 does he work for? Does the Director, in your view, work for
8 the President of the United States, for the Attorney General,
9 for the Justice Department, for the Executive Branch?

10 Who does the executive of the FBI, the Director of the
11 FBI, be responsible to, who should he be responsible to?

12 Mr. Kelley. Jurisdictionally, to the Attorney General,

13 but I think this is such an important field of influence that

WARD & PAUL,

14 it is not at all unlikely that we can expand it to the

15 judiciary, the legislative, and of course, we are under the

16 Attorney General.

17 Senator Baker. Do you have any problems with the idea
18 of the President of the United States calling the Director of
491 the FBI and asking for performance of a particular task?

20 Does that give you any difficulty? Or do you think that
21 the relationship between the FBI Director and the President
22 is such that that is desirable, or should it be conduited

23 through the Attorney General?

24 Mr. Kelley. I think it should be in the great majority

410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

25 of the cases conduited through the Attorney General. There

ashz8 1 has been traditionally some acceptance of the fact that if
Y :
& : i
i 2 the President wants to see and talk with the Director, he
2 Z ‘
& cs may do so, call him directly.

It has been my practice in such an event to thereafter
5 report to the Attorney General, whoever it might be, that I
6 have been called over and I discussed and was ‘told. And this
7 was revealed in full to them.

8 Senator Baker. I suppose we could pass a statute that
9 says the President has to go through the Attorney General,

10 although I rather “suspect it would be a little presumptuous.
11 But to go the next step, do you think it is necessary
12 for the pursuit of effective oversight on the part of the

13 Congress, to have some sort of document written, or at least

WARD & PAUL

14 some sort.of account of a Presidential order or an order of

156 the Attorney General given to a Director of the FBI?

16. Do you think that these things need to be handled in
aly? a-more formal way?
18 Mr. Kelley. Personally, it would be my practice in

19 the event I receive such an order, to request that it be

20 documented. This is a protection as well as a clarification
21} as to whether or not it should be placed as part of legislation.
22 I frankly would like to reserve that for some more considera-~
23 tion.

24 I don't know whether it would be, but I think that it

Senator Baker. Mr. Kelley, Attorney General Levi, I
believe, has already established some sort of agency or
function within the Department ae is serving as the equivalent,
I suppose, of an Inspector General of the Justice Department,
including the FBI.

Are you familiar with the steps that Mr. Levi has
taken in that respect? I think he calls it the Office of
Professional Responsibility. i

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir, I'm familiar with it.

Senator Baker. Do you have any comment on that? Will
you give us any observations as to whether you think that
will be useful, helpful, or whether it will not be useful or
helpful, how it affects the FBI, how you visualize your
relationship: to it in the future?

Mr. Kelley. I don't object to this, which is to some
extent an oversight within the Department of Justice under the
Attorney General.

Frankly, it just came out. I have not considered it
completely, but to the general concept, yes, I very definitely
subscribe.

Senator Baker. How would you feel about extending that
concept of government-wide operation, a national Inspector
General who is involved with an oversight of all of the :
agencies of government as they interface with the Constitutionaljly

protected rights of the individual citizen? Would you care

11 existed when much of the abuse that we have talked about during

12 this inquiry occurred, indicating that the people within the

WARD & PAUL,

13 Bureau felt like they were doing what was expected of them
14 by the President, by the Attorney General, the Congress and
15 the people of the United States.

16 Does not this suggest that there has oS a reaction
17 there to prevailing attitudes that might have existed in the
18 country because of certain circumstances rather than any

19 || clear and specific direct instructions that might have been
20 received from proper authorities? And if that is the case,
21 || is it possible in developing this charter, this guideline,
22 to provide for that kind of specific instruction?

danger if any agency is left to simply react to whatever the
attitudes may he.at a specific time in this country because ~--
Mr. Kelley. Senator; I don't contemplate it might be
a continuing danger, but it certainly would be. a very acceptah
guidepost whereby we can, in the event “such a need seems
to arise, know what we can do.
Senator Huddleston. Well, in pursuing the area which
Senator Hart was discussing, that is whether or not we can
provide sufficient guidelines would replace a decision by the

court in determining what action might be proper and specific-

‘ally in protecting individual's rights, can't we also

provide the restrictions and guidelines and the various
techniques that might be used?

For -instance, supposing we do establish the fact, as
has already been done, that informants are necessary and
desirable. tow do we keep that informant operating within the
proper limits so that he in fact is not violating individual
rights?

Mr. Kelley. Well, of course, much of the reliance must
be placed on the agent and.the supervision of the FBI to assure
that there is no infringement of rights.

Senator Huddleston. But this is an aware we've gotten
into some difficulty in the past. We have assumed that the
particular action was necessary, that there was a present

threat that some intelligence programs should be initiated, but

in.many cases it has gone beyond what would appear to have been
necessary to have addressed the original threat.

How do we keep within the proper balance there?

Mr, Kelley. Well,.actually, it's just about like any
other offense. It is an invasion of the other individual's
right and it is by an officer and an FBI esi an officer.
There's the possibility of criminal prosecution against him.

This is one which I think might flow if he counsels”
the informant.

Now insofar as his inability to control the informant,

I don't suppose that would warrant prosecution, but there is
still supervisory control over that agent and over that
informant by insisting that control is exercised on a continuin
basis.

Senator Huddleston. It brings up an interesting point
as to whether or not a law enforcement agency ought to be
very alert to any law violations of its own members or anyone
else.

If a White House official asks the FBI or someone to do
something unlawful, the question seems to me to occur as to
whether or not that is not a violation that should be reported
by the FBI.

Mr. Kelley. I think that any violation which comes to
our attention should either be handled by us or the proper

authority.

The question that I'm really concerned about is .as
we attempt to draw a guideline and charters that would give
the Agency the best flexibility that they may need, a wide
range of threats, how do we control what happens within each
of those actions to keep them from going beyond what

was intended to begin with?

Mr. Kelley. You're still speaking of informants.

Senator Huddleston. Not only informants but the agents
themselves as they go into surveillance, wiretaps, or whatever
intelligence gathering techniques.

The original thrust of my questjon was, even though we
May be able to provide guidelines of a broad nature, how do
we control the techniques that might be used, that ini themselves
might be used, that in themselves might be a serious violation
of the rights.

Mr. Kelley. Well, first, I don't know whether it's
germane to your question but I do feel that it should be pointed
out that the association to, the relationship between the
informant and his agent handler is a very confidential one,
and I doubt very seriously whether we could have any guide-
lines, where there might be an extension of any monitors here
because thereby you do have a destruction of that relationship,
Insofar as thé activities of agents, informants’ or others
which may_be illegal, we have on many occasions learned of
violations of the law on the part of informants, and either
prosecuted ourselves, through the reporting of it to the
United States Attorney, or turned it over to the local authority.
We have done this on many a time, many occasions. Insofar
as our own personnel, we have an internal’organization, the
Inspection Division, which reviews this type of activity, and

if there be any violation, yes, no question about it, we would

pursue it to the point of prosecution.

Senator Huddleston. But it could be helped by periodic
review.

Mr. Kelley. We do, on an annual basis, review the
activities of our 59 offices through that same Inspection
Division, and they have a clear charge to go over this as well
as ‘other matters

Senator Huddleston. Mr. Kelley, you pointed. out the
difference in the approaches when gathering intelligence, in
gathering evidence after a crime has been committed.

Would there be any advantage, or would it be feasible to
attempt to separate these functions within the aes in the
departments, for instance, with not having a mixing of
gathering intelligence and gathering evidence? Are the techni
definable and different?‘

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think they are compatible. I
see no objection to the way that they are now being handled
on a management basis. I think, as a matter of fatt, it is
a very fine association whereby the intelligence, stemming as
it does from a substantive violation, is a natural complement.

Senator Huddleston. Now, another area, the FBI furnishes
information to numerous government agencies.

Is this properly restricted and controlled at the present
time in your judgment as to just who can ask the FBI for

information, what kind of information they can ask for, and

< i
H 3 Could there be some clearcut understanding as to whether
2 :
4 or not the Director would be obligated to undertake any such

6 Mr. Kelley. It's very clear to me that any request must
” come from Mr. Buchen's office, and that it be, in any case,

8 wherein it is a request for action, that it be followed with
9 a letter so requesting.

10 This has come up before during the Watergate hearings, as

13 underling who does not truly reflect.the desire of the President.

15 techniques, aside from the guidelines of authority on broad

7 Would it be feasible from time to time in a Congressional

probably even more importantly, what restrictions can be put
on the use of that information once it has been supplied by
the FBI? Steeeatertteate

Mr. Kelley. I think so, Senator.

Senator Huddleston. You think there are proper restrictiagns
now?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know that we can ourselves judge
in all cases whether or not there is good and sufficient reason
for an Agency to inquiry. I think that there should be a
very close delineation by the agencies as to what they're
going to ask for, but I think that we do have sufficient rules
that at least to us we are satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. You're confident that the information
your agency supplies is not being misused, to the detriment
of the rights of any individuals.

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I'm only confident in what I
do myself. I would say that I am satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. I was wondering whether some
inclusion ought to be made in whatever charter is made as to
who specifically can request, what limits ought to be ‘placed
on what the request, and what they can do with it after they
get it.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Senator Huddleston. I have some concern about the fact

that in intelligence gathering, you gather, you are just

bound to gather a great deal of information about some
individual that is useless as far as the feet of the intelli-
gence gathering is concerned, but might be in some way embarras-
sing or harmful to the individual, whether or not there's any
effort to separate this kind of information out of a person's
file that is really initiated for a purpose, for a specific
purpose unrelated to this information.

Is there any effort, or could any direction be given to
doing that?

Mr. Kelley. We would be very happy to work under the
guidelines or rules or anything else to purge material which
is extraneous, irrelevant, or for any other reason objection-
able.

Senator Huddleston. And how about the length of time
that these files are kept in the agency?

Mr. Kelley. We are willing to work within that framework,
too.

Senator Huddleston. I think that might be done.

Now, I think in developing the chain of command, so to
speak, it certainly would be very difficult to prevent the
President of the United States from calling up the head of
the FBI or anyone else and discussing any law enforcement
problem he might so desire, and perhaps even give direction
to the agency.

But how about that? What about White House personnel

informants. We'll discuss techniques, we'll discuss our
present activities. I think this is the only = that we can
exchange our opinions and get accomplished what you want to
accomplish and what I want to accomplish.

Senator Huddleston. I feel that is an important aspect
of it because even though you have a charter which gives broad
direction for all the guidelines and to the types of projects
that enter into it, if we don't get down to specifics, such
things as how intelligence is to be collected, how evidence

is to be collected, what is done after it is collected, this

again for the Bureau to assume that it has total instruction
and total permission to move in a certain rine pil and go
beyond what is intended or what was authorized,

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Director.

The Chairman. Senator Goldwater?

Senator Goldwater. Mr. Kelley, as part of the FBI
electronic surveillance of Dr. King, several tapes of
specific conversations, and later a composite King tape were
produced.

Are these tapes still in the possession of the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by you?

Mr. Kelley. No, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by any of you

staff, to your knowledge?

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think that they have been reviewed]
I know that at least some have reviewed it within the area of
this particular section. There has been no review of them
since I came to the FBI, I can tell you that.

Senator Goldwater. Would these tapes be available to
the Committee if the Committee felt they would like to hear
them?
Mr. Kelley. This, Senator Goldwater, is a matter which d
of, as I said before, some delicacy, and there would have to ;
be a discussion of this in an executive session.

The Chairman. I might say in that connection that the
Committee staff gave some consideration to this matter and
decided that it would compound the original error for the
staff to review the tapes, because that would be a_ still
further invasion of privacy, and so the staff refrained from
insisting on obtaining the tapes, believing that it was
unnecessary, and quite possibly improper, in order to get at
what.we needed to know about the King case.

So the staff did refrain, and for that reason the issue
never came to a head. I just wanted to lay that information
before the Senator.

Senator Goldwater. I realize that's a prerogative of
the staff, but it's also the prerogative of the Committee if,

and I'm not advocating it, if we wanted to hear them to

ourselves whether Mr. Hoover was off on a wild goose chase
or whether pei was, in effect, some reason. Again, I am
not advocating it, I am merely asking a question. They would
be available if the Committee took a vote to hear them and
decided on it.

Mr. Kelley. I don't think it would be within my juris-
diction to respond to this, Senator. It would have to be the
Attorney General.

Senator Goldwater. I see.

Now, are these tapes and other products of surveillance
routinely retained even after an individual ceased to be a
target of inquiry? :

Mr. Kelley. "they are retained usually for ten years.

Senator Goldwater. Ten years.

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. What is the future value, if any,
to the Bureau of retaining such information?

Mr. Kelley. If there be guidelines that set out a
destruction or erasure,we will abide by it. We will, on those
occasions where we think that matters might come up within
that period of time which may need the reténtion of them, we
will express our opinion at that time, but other than that
we would be guided by guidelines.

Senator Goldwater. Is it your view that legitimate

law enforcement needs should outweigh privacy considerations

with respect to retention of such information, or do we néed
the clear guidelines on the destruction of these materials
when the investigation purposes for which they were collected
have been served?

Mr. Kelley. We feel that there should be a good close

look at the retention of material, and we would of course like
to have an input. But we welcome consideration of this.

Senator Goldwater. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman, Thank
you very much.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

Senator Mondale?

Senator Mondale. Mr. Director, it seems to me that the
most crucial question before the Congress is to owede the
invitation of the FBI to draw Congressionally imposed lines,
limits of authority so the FBI will know clearly what you can
and cannot do, so you will not be subject to later judgments,
and the question is, where should that line be drawn?

As you know, in 1924 when the FBI was created, and
Mr. Stone later became the Chief Justice, he drew the line at
criminal law enforcement. He said that never again will we
go beyond the authority-imposed upon us to get into political
ideas. We will stay in the area of law enforcement.

Would you not think it makes a ‘good deal of sense to
draw the guidelines ina way that your activities are

restricted to the enforcement of the law, investigations of

crime, investigations of conspiracies to commit crime rather
than to leave this very difficult to define and control area
of political ideas?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know whether I understand your last
statement of involving the area of political ideas, I- say that
I feel that certainly we should be vested and should continue
in the field of criminal investigations as an investigatory
objective. These are conclusions, of course, which are based
on statutes in the so-called security field, national or
foreign.

These are criminal violations. I feel that they should
be in tandem. I feel, having worked many years in this
atmosphere, that. you have more ears and eyes and you have
more personnel working together, covering the same fields..

I do not think there should be a separation of the intelligence
matters, because it is a concomitant. It naturally flows
from the investigation of the security matters and the
eriminal.

Senator Mondale. Mr. Kelley, what'Mr. Stone: said was
this, that the Bureau of investigation is not concerned
with political or other opinions of individuals. It is
concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws
of the United States. When the police system goes beyond
these limits, it is dangerous to proper administration of

justice and human liberty.

3 2 Mr. Kelley. I think that life has become much more

that would provide any basis for oversight? E

How can you, from among other things, be protected from
criticism later on that you exceeded your authority or didn't
do something that some politician tried to pressure you into
doing?

Mr. Kelley. It might well be, Senator, that ten years
from now a Director of the FBI will be seated here and will be
criticized for doing that which today is construed as very
acceptable.

Senator Mondale. Correct. And I have great sympathy
for the predicament the FBI finds itself in.

Mr. Kelley. And the Director.

Senator Mondale. And the Director especially, and that is
why I think it's in the interest of the FBI to get these lines
as sharply defined as possible, so that when you are pressured
to do things, or when, after the fact, people with good 20/20

hindsight can criticize you or the Bureau, that you can say

well, here are the standards that you gave us, and they |

ally say this, and that is your answer. We have to live by

the law. If we don't define it specifically,it seems to me
that these excesses could reoccur, because I don't think it's
possible to define them, and the FBI is inevitably going to

be kicked back and forth, depending on personal notions of what
you should have done.

Don't you fear that?

Mx. Kelley. Not too much, Senator. I think we learned a
great lesson by virtue of Watergate, the revelations that have
come up as a result of this Committee's inquiries, the fact
that I think that we have a different type of spirit today
in the Bureau, the fact that, as I said before. you came in,
that I think the Bureau is a matchléss organization, and they
are eager to do that which is vital and proper, and the fact
that we are getting a number of very fine young people in the
organization, people of the other ethnic backgrounds than we
had years ago. I think there is a greater understanding in
the Bureau today of what is the proper type of conduct.

We may not be able to project this on all occasions,
because we must equate this with the need and with our
experience, but if the precise guidelines be the goal, you're
going to have trouble. If, on the other hand, there be a
flexibility, I think that we can work very well within those
guidelines.

Senator Mondale. I think, as you know, I don't think
there is a better trained or higher professionally qualified
law enforcement organization in the world than the FBI. I
think we all agree it is superb. But the problem has been,
from time to time, that when you go beyond the area of
enforcing the law into. the area of political ideas, that you
are subject to and in fact you leave the criminal field, you

get into politics. And that is where, it seems to me, that th

great controversy exists, and.where you are almost inevitably
going to be subjected to fierce criticism in the future, no
matter how you do it. Once you get into politics, you. get
into trouble.

Mr. Kelley. I agree to that, and I point out that in almost
every branch of the government and in every part, as a matter
of fact, every segment of our society, there are some who deviate
from the normal course. I feel that within the Bureau there is
less likelihood of this to happen, and I think that working
with you we can at least make some achievements that will be
significant. ,

Now, whether it be lasting, I don't think so, but I
think we've made a good start.

Senator Mondale. In your speech in Montreal on August
9th, you said we must be willing to surrender a small measure
of our liberties to preserve the great bulk of them.

Which liberties did you have in mind?

Mr. Kelley. Well, of course, this speech has been mis~
understood many, many times.

Senator Mondale. Well, I want you to have a chance to
clear it up. miata co

Mr. Kelley. All that was intended here was a restatement
of the approach which the courts historically have used in
resolving most issues of Constitutional importance, and its

recognition that rights are not susceptible to absolute

protection. It's a matter of balance. Even in the Fourth
Amendment, for example, which protects the right of privacy, it

does not prohibit searches and seizures. I mention, it only

| refers to those that are unreasonable.

I came from the police fiedd. What is more restrictive
to more people than traffic regulation? But what would be
more chaotic is of you did not have traffic regulation. We
do have to , in order to love in the complexities and
intricacies of today's life, have to give up some of our
xights.

Some may construe this as an extravagant statement. If j
is os, I wish to say that I only was pointing out that there
has to be a balance.

Senator Mondale. So that when you say we have to give «
up some liberties, or as you just said, some rights, what you
mean -- let me ask. Let me scratch: that and ask again, you
have to give up some tights. Which rights would you have us
give up?

Mr. Kelly. Well, under the Fourth Amendment you would
have the right for search and seizure.

Senator Mondale. You wouldn't give up the Fourth Amend-
ment right.

Mr. Kelley. Oh, no not the right.

Senator Mondale. What right do you have in mind?

Mr. Kelley. The right to be free from search and seizuye.

Senator Mondale. There's no such right in the Consti-
tution. You can have such seizures, but they must be reasonable,
under court warrant.

Did you mean to go beyond that?

Mr. Kelley. That's right.

Senator Mondale. That you should be able to go beyond
that?

Mr. Kelley. No, no. I do not mean that we should ever
go beyond a Constitutional right guarantee.

Senator Mondale. Well, would you say, Mr. Kelley, that
that sentence might have been inartful in your speech?

Mr. Kelley. I said that if it was misunderstood, I
made a mistake, because I should never make a statement which 4-
yes, it was inartful.

Senator Mondale. I think I know about your record in
law enforcement well enough to tell you that I think you were
saying something different, that it was taken to mean something
different than I think you intended:

What you are saying is that in the exercise of your law
enforcement powers, the rights of individuals is determined
by the laws and the courts, but the courts, in the handling
of those issues, have to balance rights and other values.

That's what you're essentially saying, is that correct?

not by the Director of the FBI but by ‘the courts and by the

vi hamper you from investigations of crime control in the

9 But I think implicit in his question was also an area
10 || that you didn't respond to, and that is how do you, what kind

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Senator Hart of Colorado. The Committee received a
letter from the Department of Justice a couple of days, the
Assistant Attorney General asking our cooperation in carrying
out the investigation or their efforts to review the investi-
gation conducted by the FBI into the death of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in order to determine whether that investigation
should be re-opened. They asked our cooperation, they asked
for our transcripts, the testimony before the Committee, all
material provided to the Committee by the FBI which relates
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

I guess my question is this: Why is the Justice Depart-

ment asking this Comittee for FBI files?

activities aoe reached the following conclusions, and I quote:

"The purpose of these counter-intelligence programs was
to prevent dangerously and potentially deadly acts against
individuals, organizations and institutions both public
and private across the United States."

Now we had an FBI informant in the other day before this
Committee and he stated he told the FBI on a number of
occasions he planned violent acts against black people in
groups. And yet, he said few, if any, instances in which the
FBI actually prevented violence from taking place.

How does his testimony square with your statement that
I have quoted?

Mr, Kelley. It doesn't, and I don't know if any of
his statements contrary to what we have said is the truth.

We don't subscribe to what he said, We have checked into it
and we know of no instances where, for example, 15 minutes
and that type of thing has been substantiated.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You're saying the testimony
he gave us under oath was not accurate?

Mr. Kelley. Right.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You also said in that statemen
and I quote: "I want to assure you that Director Hoover did
not conceal from superior authorities the fact that the FBI

was engaged in neutralizing and disruptive tactics against

Now the Committee has received testimony that the New
Left COINTELPRO programs was not in fact told to higher
authorities, the Attorney Gereral and Congress.

Do you have any information in this regard?

I know in that statement you cite onw or two instances,
but in terms of the bulk of COINTEL programs, the record
seems to date at least to be clear that there was not systematic
information flowing upward through the chain of command to
Director Hoover's superiors?

Mr. Kelley; May I ask that I be given the opportunity
to substantiate that with documentation?

Senator Hart of Colorado. ‘sure.

Mr... Kelley: Or respond to it.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Dorector Kelley, just in
passing, do you agree with the statement made by President
Ford that those responsible for harassing and trying to destroy
Dr. King should be brought to justice.

Mr. Kelley. Those who directly responsible and upon whese orders
the activities were taken responsible. I don't know if he intended to say
that, but if he did not, I would say that it would be more proper. Insofar
as my own opinion is concerned, that it be centered on those who said
to do it and those who are responsible,

I.took the responsibility for any such program and I

don't expect that those under me would be not acting in

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

Director Kelley, in the Committee's review of the
COINTELPRO program and other political involvements of the
FBI, it seems to me that we have encountered two or three
basic questions.

Since the investigation is over insofar as the Committee
is concerned, we're now turning our attention to remedies for
the future, what I would think would be our constructive
legislative work, it is very important that we focus on what
we learned in that investigation.

And one thing that we have learned is that Presidents of

the United States have from time to time ordered the FBI to

obtain for them certain kinds of information by exercising the
necessary surveillance to obtain .and to have a purely
political ee that they simply wanted to have for their
own personal purposes.

I think that you would agree that that is not a proper
function of the FBI, and you agree, ,

Yet it's awftlly difficult for anyone in the FBI,

including the Director, to turn down a President of the United

States if he receives a direct order from the President. It
is always possible, of course, to say no, and if you insist,
I will resign. But that puts a very hard burden on any man
serving in your position, particularly if the President puts
a good face on the request and makes it sound plausible or
even invents some excuse, It is always easy for him to say,
you know, I am considering Senator White for an important.
position in my administration, and I need to know more about
his activities, particularly of late. I've had some cause
for concern and I want to be certain that there is nothing in
his record that would later embarrass me, and I just want you
to keep careful track of him and report to me on what he's
been doing lately.

It's difficult for you to say back to the President, Mr.
President, that's a very questionable activity for the FBI,
and I frankly don't believe that you've given me the real

reason why you want this man followed. I think his opposition

I mean, you know, the Director can hardly talk back that
way, and I'm wondering what we caquld do in the way of protectin:
your office and the FBI from political exploitation in this
basic charter that we write,

Now, I want your suggestions, but let's begin with one
or two of mine. I would like your response. :

If we were to write into the law that any order.given you
either by the President or by the Attorney General should he
transmitted in writing and should clearly state the objective
and purpose of the request and that the FBI would maintain
those written orders and that furthermore ‘they would be
available-to any oversight committee of the Congress. If the
joint committee on intelligence is established, that committee
would have access to such a file.

So that the committee itself would be satisfied that
orders were not being given to the FBI that were improper or
unlawful.

What would you think of writing a provision of that kind
into a charter for the FBI? [

Hr, Kelley. I would say writing into the law any order
issued by, the President that is a request for action by the
Attorney General should be in writing, is certainly, in my

opinion, is a very plausible solution. I'm sure that in

contemplation of this there would be some that will say yes
or some that will say no, but I think we could define an
area where you are trying to cure the abuses and we could
do that.

Now as to the availability to any oversight committee
of Congress, I would say generally that I certainly would have
no objection to this, but I again, there may be some request
for something of high confidentiality that the President might
put in writing such as some national or foreign security
matter.

I would like to have such a consideration be given a
great deal of thought and that the oversight conmittee review
be conditioned with that possibility. I don't think it would
present a problem.

I have said previously that I feel I can discuss every-
thing except the identity of the informants to the oversight
committee, I welcome that.

The Chairman. Well, that has been of course the way we
proceeded with this Committee. It has worked pretty well,

I think. ,

Now Senator Goldwater brought up a question on the

why are they preserved? Why arate they simply destroyed?

Is there a problem that we can help through new law to enable
the FBI to remove from its files so much of this information
that is has collected that it is no longer needed or may never
have connected the person with any eriminal activity?’ And
yet, all of that information just stays there in the files
year after year.

What can we do? How can a law be changed? If that's
not the problem, then what is? Why are these tapes still down
there at the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Well, of course, we do have the rule that
they are maintained ten years. Now why the rule is your
question and why right now are they maintained? Since we
do maintain everything since the inquiry has started and until
that's lifted, we can't destroy anything.

I would say that this is a proper area for guidelines

some flexibility and I know that's a broad statement but there
might he some areas wherein that the subject of the investigation
himself may want them retained because it shows his innocence.

I think you have to deliberate this very carefully, but
it can he done and we acl willing to be guided by those
rules,

The Chairman, Let me ask you this. The FBI is conducting

thousands of investigations every year on possible appointees

to Federal positions. As a matter of fact, the only time I
ever see an FBI agent is when he comes around and flashes his
badge and asks me a question or two about what I know of Mr.
so and so, who's being considered for an executive office.
And we have a very brief conversation in which I tell him that
as far as I know, he's a loyal and patriotic citizen, and that
is about the extent of it.

Then when this file is completed and the person involved
is either appointed or not appointed, what happens to that
file? I know it's full of all kinds of gossip because it is
in the nature of the investigation to go out to his old
neighborhoods and talk to everybody who might have known him.

What happens to the file? Is that just retained forever?

Mr. Kelley. We have some capability of destroying some
files and they are rather lengthy insofar as retention. We
have some archival rules which govern the retention of mateial
and is’ developed in cases involving certain members of the
Executive Branch of the government.

I see no reason why this would not be a proper area
for consideration of legislation,

The Chairman, Can-you give me any idea of how much --
do you have records that would tell us how ae tine and money
is being spent by the FBI just in conducting these thousands
of routine investigations on possible Presidential appointments

to Federal offices?

Mr. Kelley. I feel confident we can get it. I do not
have it now, but if you would like to have the annual cost
for the investigation of Federal appointees --

The Chairman. Yes. Plus, you know, plus any other
information that would indicate to us what proportion of the
time and effort of the FBI was absorbed in this kind of
activity.

Mr. Kelley. I can tell you it is relatively small, hut
I can get you, I think, the exact amount of time and the
approximate expense.

The Chairman. I wish you would do that because this is
a matter we need riore information about. And when you supply
that data to the Committee, would you also supply the number
of such investigations each year?

You know, I don't expect you to go back 20 or 25 years,
but give us a good idea of the last few years. For example,
enough to give us an idea of how much time and how broad the
reach of these investigations may be.

Mr. Kelley. Through '70?

fhe Chairman. That would be sufficient, I would think.

ie other matter that is connected to this same subject
that I would like your best judgment on is whether these
investigations could not be limited to offices of sensitivity.
That is to say where legitimate national security interest might

be involved so that there is a reason to make a close check on

past associations, attitudes oa expressions of belief.

I have often wondered whether we couldn't eliminate
routine Federal offices that are not particularly sensitive
in the national security sense from the reach of these FBI
checks.

And so when you respond to the series of questions, I
wish you would include the offices that are now covered by
such checks and give us an idea of how far down into the
Federal bureaucracy this extends.

Could you do that?

Mr, Kelley. Yes, sir,

The Chairman, Fine.

Now there is a vote. The vote always comes just at
the wrong time, but Mr. Schwarz wants to ask you some additional
questions for the record, and there may be other questions,
too that would be posed by the staff, after which I will ask
Mr. Schwarz to adjourn the hearings. It looks like we're going
to be tied up on the floor with votes.

But before I leave I want to thank you for your testimony,
Hix. Kelley, and to express my appreciation to. you for the
way you have cooperated with the Committee in the course of
its investigation during the past months.

Mr. Kelley. Thank you.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Kelley, I'll try to be very brief.

On page 5 of your: statement =

Mr. Kelley. What?

Mr. Schwarz. On page 5 of your statement, the third
full paragraph, you said the following, and I would like then
to question about what you said. "We must recognize that
situations have occurred in the past and will arise in the
future where the Government may well be expected to depart from
its traditional role, in the FBI's case, as an investigative
and intelligence-gathering agency, and take affirmative steps
which are needed to meet an imminent threat to human life or
property."

Now, by that you mean to take what kind of steps in what
kind of situation?

And can you give some concrete examples under your general
principles statement?

Mr. Kelley. I think that Mr. Adams addressed himself to
that the other day, where you have an extremist who is an
employee at the waterworks, and he makes a statement that he's
going to do something which is devastating to the city, and you
have no way to attack this under the ordinary procedures, and
so therefore you must take some steps to meet that imminent
threat to human life or property.

Mr. Schwarz. So let us take that case as a test of the

principle. You are saying the extremist has said he is going

to do something to the waterworks, poison it or something, and
jhe is on the way down there with the poison in. his car.

Is that the presumption?

Mr. Kelley. We hadn't gone that ree but all right, you
can extent it.

Mr. Schwarz. All right, now, in that case you have the
traditional law enforcement tool, which is the power of arrest.
Mr. Kelley. Not under probable cause where he has not
gone down there. The hypothetical we gave was one where he had

not taken any overt acts in perpetration of this.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, if he hasn't taken any overt acts,
are you then in what you would call in imminent threat of
human life or property?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Schwarz. How so? Unless he has taken an overt act:
to buy the poison or to get in the car with the poison, there
is not by definition any threat to life or property.

Mr. Kelley. Mr. Schwarz, I've-been around in this business.
a long time. I've-heard a number of threats which were issued,
and they thereafter materialized into actions. I don't think “+
take these threats as being empty ones, because so many times
they have been acted upon.

I was criticized one time when there was a threat made to
kill me, and it was said later on, it's not rhetoric, it's

not rhetoric to me, because when they say they're going to

Mr. Kelley. But you are disagre@ing with me. You're i
on the basis of experience that you Mes detect a possible
threat. That's the whole area of concern that we have here, wndee i
we don't lose the capability of doing something. We don't
say we should initiate ourselves. We say that we should go to
the Attorney General. We do not subscribe to the idea that
we should act independently because maybe we don't have the
judicial review, the capability of determining, but we do
think that we should report it and thereafter see what can
be done.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, have you changed in the course of
our discussion the standard on page 5.

On page 5 you're talking about an imminent threat.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And I hear you now as saying a possible
threat.

Mr. Kelley. An imminent possible threat.

Mr. Schwarz. An imminent possible threat. All right.

Now, would a fair standard for either action, other than
arrest, I don't know what you have in mind, but something to
prevent the person from carrying out: his activities, other
than arrest, for instance, what is an example of what you have

in mind?

Mr. Kelley. Removing him from his position or whatever
is necessary ‘in order to make it impossible or at least as
impossible as possible to perpetuate this thing.

Mr. Schwarz. You mean have him lose his job or --

Mr. Kelley. I don't know what it would be.

Mr. Schwarz. Isolate him in some fashion.

Mr. Kelley. In some fashion perhaps.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, for such activity and for opening
an investigation into a domestic group, could you live with

a standard which said you would have to have an immediate

threat that someone was likely to commit a serious federal
crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. I think that this thing could be worked out
so that there could be an adequate basis for an evaluation.

Mr. Schwarz. So those words, without trying to commit
you entirely to them, do not seem to you to depart far from
what you think would be an acceptable standard.

Mr. Kelley. Well, an imminent, immediate threat might
be, by virtue of the word "immediate" that he's going to
do it the next minute. In that case it may be necessary for
you to, not with the presence or the possibility, not able
to do anything except put him under arrest or anything.

Mr. Schwarz. Of course, of course.

And nobody would at all disagree with that kind of action.

Mr. Kelley. I don't think they would either.

Mr. Schwarz. But on the question, let's take the opening
of an investigation into a domestic group.

Is it basically consistent with practicality to make the
test immediate threat of a serious Federal crime involving
violence?

Mr.Kelley. To open a domestic security case.

Mr. Schwarz. Yes.

Mr. Kelley. It appears to me that this is a terrorist
activity, in effect. We certainly have terrorist activities
under our jurisdiction as a threat against the United States.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, are there other circumstances where
it is justifiable to open an investigation of the domestic
group where you do not have an immediate threat of serious
federal crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. Oh, I think there are other criteria, and
they have been well defined as to what is the possible
opening, the basis for a possible opening. We haven't been
discussing that, we have been discussing particular instances,
but there are other criteria that are used, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. What would the other criteria be?

Mr. Kelley. Well, the possible statutory violations
over which we have jurisdiction are, generally speaking, the
most used of thebasis, and then you have, of course, some
intelligence investigations which should, of course, be of

short duration. If there is no showing of this into action

or a viable intent.

Mr. Schwarz. So that's what you're looking for in the
intelligence investigation?

Mr. Kelley... By intelligence investigation, yes, you
are looking to prevent.

Mr. Schwarz. And what you are looking colpdeventy and
what you're looking to find is a likelihood of action combined
with an intent to take an issue?

Mr. Kelley. And the capability.

Mr. Schwarz. And the capability.

All right. I just have two other lines, Mr. Kelley, and
I appreciate very much your time.

Mr. Kelley. That's all right.

Mr. Schwarz. Assuming a legitimate investigation has
been started into a domestic intelligence matter, is it legiti-
mate for the FBI, in addition to obtaining information that
relates to what we've just been talking about, the likelihood
of violent action, is it also legitimate for the FBI to
collect, A, retain, B, disseminate, C, information concerning
let's say the sex life of a person on the one hand, and the
political views of a person on the other?

Mr. Kelley. I think, Mr. Schwarz, that this is just what
many of our problems and perhaps the guidelines can define
this type of thing. I think probably you will agree that

within the determination of the deviations possibly of sex

1g || might be relevant, but don't you think that as a function of

22 Mr. Kelley. Insofar as doing it presently, it has been

as a determination by guidelines that might be prepared later,
I think that we can certainly deliberate on this to see whether
or not this is something we should retain, and we would not
object to anything reasonable in that regard.

Mr. Schwarz. I just have one final question.

Taking the current manual and trying to understand its
applicability laid against the facts in the Martin Luther King
case, under Section 87 there is a -- permission is granted to
open investigations of the infiltration of non-subversive
groups, and the first sentence reads: "When information is
received indicating that a sb group is seeking to
systematically infiltrate and control a non-subversive group
or organization, an investigation can be opened." ,

Now, I take it that is the same standard that was used
in opening the investigation of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in the 1960s, so that invéstigation could still be
open today under the FBI manual, the current FBI manual.

Mr, Kelley. We are interested in the infiltration of
clearly subversive groups into non-subversive groups inasmuch
as this is a ploy that is used many times, and having infil-
trated, they then get control, and they have a self-laundered
organization which they can use, and not, certainly, to the
benefit of the country.

Mr. Schwarz. But is the answer to my question yes, that

under that standard, the SCLC investigation could still be

opened today?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Pn All right, then, just one final question.

Do you agree that special care needs to be taken not only
of the standards for initially opening an investigation of a
group, but perhaps extra care needs to be taken when the investil-
gation goes beyond the initial target group to individuals
or people who come into contact with it?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know if I agree with that entirely. If
you mean that we go into the non-subversive group, that we
then investigate peopie in that non-subversive group, not the
infiltrators, but the non, that a conduct a lengthy investigatifon
of them without any basis for doing so other than that they
are in an infiltrated group, I would likely have said -- but
off the top of my head I would say probably that's not necessary.

Mr. Schwarz. Thank you very much.

Mr. Smothers. Just a couple of very brief lines of
inquiry, Mr. Kelley.

I think that the questions of the Chief Counsel. was
raising is one that goes further into your statement, when you
talk about the difficulty of setting out the line between

intelligence gathering and law enforcement kinds of functions. .

Nevertheless, though, I think that you have made an effort,

indeed, the Bureau's organizational scheme reflects a «-

to distinguish some of this has been made.

Putting aside for one moment the counterespionage
effort, and looking strictly at what we have ‘been calling the
Domestic Intelligence, is it yours viet that the retention of
this function in the Bureau is critical to the Bureau's
law enforcement position?
Mr. Kelley. My personal opinion is that the Bureau does
a splendid job in this area. I feel further that the background

of criminal investigatory activities and experiences which

all counterintelligence people have is very helpful. It is hel
ful not only in gathering knowledge and experience, it also
enters into this field, a person with a broad understanding

of the rights and privileges, and you don't have so much that
spy type, that cloak and dagger, that very, very secret type

of an operation.

I subscribe to the present system heartily.

Mr. Smothers. Would it be of assistance to your mission
if within the Bureau guidelines were established that
effectively limited access or controlled dissemination of
the intelligence product? In other words, if we had a
situation where the intelligence product is critical to assist
the law enforcement effort, I don't think there's any question
that there should be access to it.

Isn't our problem one of controlling the use of that
intelligence product and preventing the kind of murky crossing

of lines there with the information legitimately needed for

law enforcement? e ae

Mr. Kelley. There is always a problem when there is wide
dissemination, because that just numerically increases the
possibility of misuse, abuse or slander, libel, or anything
of that matter, and I think that it would be well worthwhile
to review the dissemination rules to make them subject to
close guidance in the guidelines that we're speaking of.

Mr. Smothers. Let me just raise one final area with you.

We talked a little bit about, or a question was raised about
the investigation now being conducted by the Justice Department
regarding the improper actions on the COINTELPRO, and the
King case in particular.

As we look at allegations of impropriety by your personnel
I think it would be helpful for our record here to have some
insight into the procedure the Bureau would normally follow.

What does the Bureau do when you get an allegation that
an agent or administrative official in the Bureau has behaved
improperly?

Is an investigation conducted internally, or is it
routinely referred to the Justice Department?

Mr. Kelley. There may be a revision in this type of
procedure as a result of the establishment of the Council for
Professional Responsibility. At present it would be in the
great majority of the cases turned over to our Investigative

Division for investigation. There might, on some unusual

occasion, be a designation of a special task force made up,
perhaps, of division heads. That is most unlikely, but it is
handled internally at present.

Mr. Smothers. Would these internal determinations be
reviewed by Justice, or do you think that is a necessary
step?

I guess what we are searching for here is, first of all,
I think you answered that, well, to what extent does the
Bureau police itself, and then secondly, is the Department of
Justice involved in the police determinations?

For instance, what if the Attorney General disagreed with
the assertion that only the higher up officials who ordered
the action against King should be the subject of investigation
and maybe prosecution?

How does the interplay work there between you and Justice?

Mr. Kelley. We do report to the Attorney General those
activities which we construe as improper or possibly. illegal.
There is a possibility that the Department, having been advised
of the situation, might take it on their own to do their own
investigating, and this is something that we feel is a
decision to be made only rather rarely, because we feel we
have within our own organization sufficient capability to
handle that. But we do not protest it. It is handled
independently of us.

Mr. Smothers. Thank you.

Mr. ‘Church’s gover-Up

ra By William Safire

WASHINGON; Nov. 19—On Oct. 10,
. 1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put his personal signa-
ture on a document that launched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century,

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.
~ With great care, the committee has
- focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when?
the committee counsel first set forth
the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-
partment had existed in 1962; today,
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robert Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed
their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.”

But the Church committee showed
“no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nedy root of this precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some know!-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone unasked for
- thirteen years, |

For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to witetap Dr. King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.I. know the 4
President was consulted or informed? *

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-
fice, and the wiretapping continued,
he was told by angry newsmen that !
the FB. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr, King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis«
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church’s political.
base, That is why we do not see for-
met Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha
(Deke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnson's
personal contact with the F.B.1. in the
witness chair. What did President
Johnson ww about the character-
assassination plot and when did he
know it? What conversations took
place between Mr. Deloach and Presi-
dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.
King, or about the use of the F.B.I. in
auy other intrusions into the tives of

“The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are’ readily available. A couple of
weeks ‘ago, at an open hearing, an

FB. -man inadvertently started to *

blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 wit

. the apparent knowledge of Attorney

General Kennedy. The too-willing with
ness was promptly shooshed into sir
lence, and told that such informatio:
would be developed only in executive
session, Nobody raised an eyebrow.
That pattern of containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the F.B.I,
but the Church investigators seem to
be determined not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.I. decuments say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent's men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.I. to spy on political

opponents, whd can be brought for-:

ward to tell us all about it?

But that, would cause embarrass-’

ment to Democrats, ‘and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee's hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave’ press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes demute-
ly—and nobody demands to know!
which network executive made what.
decision under what pressure.

I have been haranguing patient
readers for years about the double
standard applied to Democratic and
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would he Jaid
before the public in damning detail.

Obviously, Democrat Frank Church
is not the man to do i, His, jowl-
shaking indignation is all too selec-
tive; the trail of high-level responsi-
bility for the crimes committed against
Dr. King and others is evidently going
to he allowed to cool.

Pity, You'd think that after ail the
nation has been through in the past
few years, our political Ieaders would
have learned that the one thing that
brings you down is the act of cover-

MEMORANDUM TO ALL EXIPLOYEES

RE: INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES

All employees are advised that Congress is conducting
an inquiry into activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Congressional staff members are conducting interviews of former
and current FBI employees. This Bureau has pledged its cooperation ‘
with the Congress.

You are reminded of the FBI Employment Agreement
(copy attached) with which you agreed to comply during your employment
in the FBI and following termination of such employment,

Also, you are reminded of Title 28, Code of Federal
Regulations, Section 16,22 (copy attached), which reads as follows:

"No employee or former employee of the Department of
Justice shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority,
produce any material contained in the files of the Department or disclose
any information relating to material contained in the files of the Department,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of
the performance of his official duties or because of his official status
without prior approval of the appropriate Department official or the
Attorney General in accordance with Section 16,24."

Also, you are reminded of Department of Justice Order
Number 116-56, dated May 15, 1956, (copy attached) which, among
other things, requires an employee upon the completion of his testimony
to prepare a memorandum outlining his testimony.

Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent
with the above cited authority. Therefore, if you are contacted for
purpose of interview or testimony you are to request approval as
required by the Employment Agreement and await authorization before
furnishing information, testimony, or record material, be 2 -bi C205

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBD, United
States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, Thereby declare
that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as
Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the
President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations
issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal
Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-
authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other
classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of
the FBI;

(2) [understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files
of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could
result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or
result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects
of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its
responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-
fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,
publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to
any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the
Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory
files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the
performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden
is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed
and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each
such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand
that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed
in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but
it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be
contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is
in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official
duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains
the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand
by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any
material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal
law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may
be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

T accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment
in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and
following termination of such employment.

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

WASHINGTON, D. C,

May 15, 1956
ORDER NO. 116-56

It is the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest
possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting information from
departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-
ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures
are prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will be
mutually satisfactory to the congressional committees and to the Department.
{This order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, dated
March 23, 1953, and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It formal-
izes the Attorney General's press release of Novenber 5, 1953, esteblishing
procedures to permit committees of the Congress and their authorized repre-
sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

No. 3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953 (with Memorandum
of "Authorization Under Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated
January 13, 1953), insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be
followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In
support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter
dated May 17, 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney
General's Memorandum which accompanied it.]

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files
or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by
the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General,
who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and
congressional committees. The request shall state the specific information
sought as well as the specific objective for which it is sought. The Deputy
Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a
reply will be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-
ture and dispatch to the chairman of the committee.

2. If the request concerns a closed case, i. e., one in which
there is no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,
the file may be made available for review in the Department, in the presence
of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure
shall be followed in such cases:

a. The reply letter will advise the committee that the
file is available for examination and set forth the
name, telephone extension number, and room number of
the person who will have custody of the file to be
reviewed;



e @

-2-

b. Before making the file available to the committee
representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI

as well as investigative reports from any other agency,
will be removed from the file and not be made available
for examination; provided however that if the committee
representative states that it is essential that information
from the FBI reports and memorands be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered
by the Department, Thereafter a summary of the contents
of the FBI reports and memoranda involved will be
prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-
niques, the identity of confidential informants, or
other. matters which might jeopardize the investigative
operations of the FBI. This summery will be forwarded
by the division to the FBI with e request for advice as
to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of
such summary by the committee representative. The file
will not be physically relinquished from the custody of
the Department. If the committee representative desires
to’ examine investigative reports from other government
agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he
will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose
reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, i. e., one which liti-
gation or administrative action is pending or contemplated, the file may
not be made available for examination by the committee's representative.
The following procedure shall be followed:

a. The reply letter should advise the committee that
its request concerns a case in which litigation or
administrative action is pending or contemplated, and
state that the file cannot be made available until the
case is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in
as much detail as is practicable and prudent without
jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or
administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEWS WITH DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL

1. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding
any official matters within the Department should be reduced to writing,
signed by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney
General. When the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the
employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with
the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting
open cases and data in investigative reports;

2. Upon the tbitpletion of the interview with the committee repre-
sentative the employee will prepare a summary of it for the file, with a
copy routed to his division head and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney
General.

C, EMPLOYEES TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

1. When an employee is requested to testify before a congressional
committee regarding official matters within the Department the Deputy Attorney
General shell be promptly informed. When the Deputy Attorney General's approv-
al is given the employee is expected to testify freely subject to limitations
prescribed in A respecting open cases and data in investigative reports;

2. An employee subpoenaed to testify before a congressional committee
on official matters within the Department shall promptly notify the Deputy
Attorney General. In general he shall be guided in testifying by Order 3229
(Revised) and the President's letter of May 17, 1954, cited at the beginning
of this Order.

3. Upon the completion of his testimony the employee will prepare
a@ memorandum outlining his testimony with a copy routed to his division head
and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which
their public testimony may affect the discipline and well-being of the institu-
tion, it is the policy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-
side the penal institution in which they are incarcerated for the purpose of
being interviewed or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,
when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be
adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise
adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath
by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated
under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the
Deputy Attorney General.

1. Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony
from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized
representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a written
request by the chairman of the committee to the Deputy Attorney General.

2. Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days
prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony
and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the
interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-
mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-
jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as well as the names of
all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who
will be present.

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be
present during the entire time of the interrogation.

4, The warden of the penal institution in which the Federal
prisoner is incarcerated shall, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
time at which the interview takes place, advise the Federal prisoner concerned
of the. proposed interview or taking of sworn testimony; and shall further
advise that he is under the same, but no greater obligation to answer than any
other witness who is not a prisoner.

5. The warden of the penal institution shall have complete
authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-
nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at
the interview and taking of testimony.

6. The warden or his authorized representative shall be present
at the interview and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice
shell have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout
the interview and taking of testimony.

7s The committee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript
made of the entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy
of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E. OBSERVERS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS

In order that the Department may be kept currently advised in
matters within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney
General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and
its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a
congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of
the proceeding which should be sent to the division head and a copy routed
to the Deputy Attorney General.
