Belarusian BeB's Offer to Review Their File on

Lee harves

During meetings with CIA officers on TDY to Minsk, Belarus,

15-18 October 1992, Chairman of the Belarusian KGB (BKGB) General

Eduard Shirkovskiy expanded on his offer to us to review the

BKGB's files on Lee Harvey Oswald, compiled in the early sixties

when Oswald lived in Minsk. Our officers reminded Shirkovskiy

that review of the file falls under FBI jurisdiction and that,

due to political sensitivities in the United States about Oswald,

CIA would prefer not to be directly involved in review of the

file.

We would, however, be willing to broker introductions

ine broker reout all

between

the BKGB and the FBI to facilitate review of the file.

Shirkovskiy noted that the BKGB would be willing to give the

FBI copies of relevant portions of the file -- summaries of

investigation results prepared at the time of Oswald's stay in

Minsk -- but would not share operational information that would

compromise their sources and methods.

In addition, the BKGB

would not surrender the original file but would permit an FBI

team to travel to Minsk to inspect the original documents and

verify their authenticity.

Study of Intelligence in the Central Intelligence Agency is

currently reviewing material on the Kennedy Assassination for

release to the National Archives.

these CIOss Reference Sheets to ensure that nothing sensitive

is necessary for CIA to forward to the Bureau in the future all
