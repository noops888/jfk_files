ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE 10-11-94 BY.328 MAC/KOK

ReBuairtel 11/26/63.

Information set out in Detroit LHM dated 11/22/63 was made

available at Detroit on 11/21/63 by Department Attorney

William French in the form of an undated blind memorandum

which he said was dictated by Robert C. Meissner on 11/19/63

concerning a meeting with Joseph F. Verhelle on 11/18/63

Mr. French requested that the information be summarized in

the same manner as in three previous letterhead memoranda

(dated 11/7,8,and 12/63) containing information from the

same source.

Mr. French had previously requested that

Meissner's identity be concealed because of the confidential

basis upon which the information had been furnished to him

by Meissner and the sensitive nature of the matter in which

the Department was seeking Meissner's cooperation, particularly

the possibility of an attempt to influence the judge or jury

in the forthcoming trial of James R. Hoffa at Chicago.

Mr. French advised that on 11/22/63 Meissner would be in

telephonic contact with French or Department Attorney Thomas

McKeon at Detroit, and it would be known whether Verhelle

had confirmed arrangements to meet Meissner in Chicago on

11/25/63. Mr. French left Detroit before there was any further

discussion with him concerning the proposed LHM.

Mr. McKeon

advised on 11/22/63 that no further word had been received

by him from Meissner regarding the proposed meeting with

Verhelle on 11/25/63.

The LHM was

submitted on the basis of

Mr. French's remarks on 11/21/63.

DE 29-1432

Inasmuch as the Bureau has advised in reairtel

that the LHM will be disseminated only to the Criminal

Division of the Department, there is no known reason for

Meissner's identity to be concealed, other than Mr. French's

original request, as mentioned above.

Nr. French probably

will not be available at Detroit for further discussion of

this point prior to next week.

If the Bureau desires to

him until that time, it will

be determined from him whether there is any objection at

this time to disclosing Meissner's identity in the IHM, and

if there is no objection by him,

an amended LHM will be

submitted immediately.

Otherwise it is believed the LHM

could be disseminated

in its present form.
