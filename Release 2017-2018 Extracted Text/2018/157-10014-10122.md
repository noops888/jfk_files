should review every covert action proposal, and the Committee
did agree that that was appropriate for a review of every
covert action proposal. I am sure that that is understood.
The thrust of this section is that the Committee recommends
that the review would consist of a series of steps, careful
and systematic analysis of the political premises underlying eng,

recommended actions, a formal meeting to consider and recommend

to the President all covert action projects in which the

views and positions of the participants would be. fully recqrded

The intent here is ~- I mean, the consistence of they

Mr. Bader. I don't believe it was in dispute when we

because I'll go through it here. :

"By statute, proposals for covert operations submitted
to the NSC Committee should show formally the concurrence or
objections for the Deputy Director of ‘Intelligenca, for the
Deputy Dixector of the Clandestine Service, the Assistant
Secretary of State, and the Ambassadors."

this. It is that as far as the Deputy Director cf tatelligence,
that is in the DDI, tne situaticn that no cbtains is that the
Deputy Director for {futeliigence. does have an opportunity tq
express his opinion, his analytical view of proposed covert
action, but that it is not formal, and from our observation of
thé process, it seemed sensible that the top of the analytical ‘

section of the Central Intelligence Agency should be formally

~ heats one

recorded in the process of covert action projects,
So when they did in fact go to the 40 Committee or its

successor Committee which we're now talking about, the Opera

tions Advisory Group, that that recommendation for covert

Se

action should formally show the concurrence or indeed, thé

objections, if that be the case, of the Deputy Director for
Intelligence.

In the process, it has. been added that the formal
concurrence of objections of a number of other individugls,
including the Assistant Secretary of State and the Ambassador
of the country or countries affected by the project, and then
perhaps was the issue for bracketing.

This is an attempt here to really get everybody on board

—

formally. Formal concurrence we see-as the best way or an

important way for those who will be responsible for these to
have formal concurrence and thereby formal responsibility.

Mr. Aaron. And to ensure that they have the access

necessary to make the judgments and so forth.

I might say that in the cases that we looked at -- and
correct :me if I am wrong, Bill -- that at least retrospectively
we have some serious question about -- of the particular
projects, and this obviously is hindsight, and hindsight is
easier than foresight.

We find that in the case of Chile, in the case of "

Indonesia, in the case of ~- I had one other one in my mind --

Angola, one or more of these individuals had serious reser~

vations about the wisdom of proceeding with these activities,

In some cases they were just cut out of the process, Tit
the only ease that we have had come before us in which th
were fully cut in but overruled was the case of Angola, Lut the
judgment is here.

As a routine process, the most sensitive things of this
nature, including something like Angola, does generally get
this kind of concurre..ce, and the purpose here is to formalize
what is at this point a general but not necessary procedure.

I wouldn't expect that each time they are going tu go
looking for the one dissent and say we have got to hear fully
from this person, but it might clarify issues.

Mr. diGenova. Also, you might have the Secretary of

of them agreeing that this is a project, and then having his
ambassador or his assistant secretary disagreeing with him the
same way that the deputy here, the CI, would be. In Angola
that was exactly the problem, that those views never got up
to ‘that level. i
Of course, the Secretary would have done exactly wha
wanted to do anyway, but:at least there would have been a

formal recommendation.

Mr. Treverton. I think the Angola case is the kind of.

“to: ‘Secretary Kissinyer, he let the people from the African
Bureau have their Secaacae, passed it on to the President,

would make it more likely that that would happen.

from the standpoint’ of accountability, and this is consistent
with that, I believe. 2

Senator Hart of Colorado. How do the Chiefs of Staff
work? Do they offer dissenting views on military operations?

- Mr. Kirbow. By law they are authorized to take a dissent
where they differ with the Secretary or the Secretary decides
against them. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs may individually
make his appeal to the President, but that is because the i
got a cabinet man that faces directly to the President,
is the law.

Senator Hart of Colorado. But I mean, do they have --
when -the Secretary reports their. views. to the President, does
it-have to be-a-unanimous vote, or can he say two chiefs are
for it and two are against?

Mr. Kirbow. I aim sure that he can say that. I know of
nothing in the law concerning the Joint Chiefs that restricts
individual views from being presented, but they do not have
a right to go above him at all except through the Chairman.

Senator Hart of Colorado. I think that is essentially
the analogy here.

Mr. Kirbow. I think the individual views of the Chiefs

Now, that system didn't always work, and it breaks down

the Director of the Arms Control Agency, the Director or. the
Secretary of the Defense or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff; for that matter, but it did make sure that the issues

any of these, so that decisions are not..just taken on the meri ties

And I think that this recommendation is aimed at twa
things: one, the paper trail, which would show concurrence
and perhaps nonconcurrence, and secondly, if there are non-
concurrences, to indicate the nature of the problem so that
that can be addressed at a higher level, much as at the
Operations Group if there is a non-concurrence, those views
are sent higher so that can be addressed to the higher level,

Mr. Bader. Can we go to No. 5 now?

Mr. Miller. No. 5.

Mr. Bader. No. 5, this recommendatoin goes to the
question of what level of specificity should one have in the
covert action budget submissions. : It argues here, and so
recommends, simply that the annual budget submission for covert

action should be specific and detailed as to the activity

pease

recommended.
This works against the careful look on the part of the
Committee and the staff as the present level of specifigi

covert action in budget recommendations, which it is fair

say are near devoid of detail. This is not to say that this
most -- the most intricate details of the operation. What we
are doing here is that it should be more specific and more
detailed than it is now. This is really a signal to the
Committee.

The second point that is in that conoumendacien is or
goes_to_the issue of where funds come from for unforeseen
covert action projects. The recommendation here is that
those—fends should come. from and be limited to the contingency .
reserve ftind, which could be replenished only after the
concurrence of the oversight and any other appropriate
Congressional Committees.

This goes to the point that the record is very clear on

this, that the contingency reserve fund, that it can be, and that

it has been replenished through pre-payments and transfers
from other sources, and this can be done internally in the
Agency without reference to the appropriate Congressional
Committees.

What we are saying here is that in those unusual circum-
stances when you have to come back for funds that are not
called for in.your annual budget submission, that those funds
should come from one source in the contingency reserve fund,
and any replenishment of that» fund should come only after the
concurrence of the oversight and the other appropriate
Congressional Committees, and that.<is the thrust ‘of “it.

Senator Huddleston. Is that gonig public with the
budget request?

Mr. Bader. No, Senator. It is not a matter of public.
It would be in the normal process; it would be a classified
budget. This is not calling for public detail for covert
action. It is calling for more detail, more specific detail
for the oversight Committee, and it is calling for a means
of containing, if you will, the funding process for covert
action to one source, an identifiable source, of which the
appropriate Congressional Committees Know where it is and how
it is being done, and have an approval chop, if you will, on
whether that fund should be replenished.

Mr. diGenova. And the Agency doesn't have any objection

—Mr-—Rirbow. Adopting this, the present procedure is that
they notify the Appropriations Committee and the office of OMB,
and it is classified, and the Director signs off on it, and they
expend the funds.

any exposure, any public exposure of the funds. it is simply

Mr. Kirbow. You indicated earlier that there haa been
considerable evidence before the Committee of funding of
covert action projects other than from the contingency fund

by some kind of transfer.

Mr. Bader. What I was referring to, Charles, was the
contingency fund as it is now established,and the rules under
which it operates can be replenished by the Agency by internal
transfers in its budget system without notification of the
appropriate Committees, and it also can be replenished through
prepayments from other agencies.
I was not speaking to the issue of how it is expended.
__-the- record shows, and we do have the statistics on this,
that the Gontingency reserve fund has been pushed to very
high levels at particular times in the Agency's history through
these replenishments and transfers and prepayments.

Mr. Kirbow. But there is a requirement that the Committee

on Appropriations be notified of the outstanding balance of

Mr. Bader. There is also a requirement that the appropriate
committees be notified when there is a drawdown to it. This
doesn't change any of that. This simply means that it requires
the concurrence of these committees for these kinds of
transfers and replenishments. It is a double check, if you

will.

Now, we tried to distinguish between those two categories
of activity in the following way: when it comes to what is in
effect covert military assistance programs, the concept ig ta
require that those programs require the prior approval of the
oversight committee and the cognizant Congressional committees
for military assistance. In effect;.the covert military
assistance prdédgram goes around the military assistance legig-
lation, which does authorize X amount of money to go toy
countries and no others, so that we feel it is importang
at least bring that under some control by giving the covert
programs the same scrutiny at. least on the committee ievel of
the Congress.‘That is what the second of these two recommenda-
tions would do.

The first deals with the less frequent but more explosive
and politically more difficult question of the use of Americans
in actual combat on a covert, paramilitary basis, and it
would require a modification -- let me back up. It would
pease principles of the War Powers Act with appropriate
modification to this kind of paramilitary activity: specifical]
the notification required under the War Powers Act would not
go to the whole Congress but would go just to the oversight
committee.

Senator Huddleston. Well, that concludes that section,

Mr. Aaron. Well, the next section is on the reorganizatio
of the CIA, and essentially it talks about the pros and cons
of the concept of dividing the CIA by taking in effect the
analytical part of it and attaching it directly to the DCI
and making the rest of the Agency a separate agency, There
are reasons to do it, raasons not to do it. The recommen
is not a firm one. fhe recommendation is that this is 4
concept that merits serious consideration as a result of our
own work, and that we would recommend that the oversight
body look at it.

Now, a lot of the reasons for doing that have to do with
the production of intelligence, and we don't have that section
of the paper here yet. I guess I would csmnena that we come
back te this section, and at this point proceed to the next
section which is relations with United States institutions and

would have a continuing review mechanism to see that these
directives remain as the Committee would like them, in this
case, to approve a prohibition on the use of members of the

I would assume it would, but whether it would take someone

Mr. Aaron. The supervisor of the heating system. It is
hard_to say.

Mr. Bader. This option which would go to encouraging, if
you will, the Agency to change its internal directives would
be buttressed, as we see the argument, on this side is that the

Remember, there ne an Operation Camelot a few years ago,
I think, in Latin America, where the pene was hicing profes-
sors to go to South America and write secret classified
papers on South American countries. When that was revealed,
I forget in what manner it was revealed, a lot of other academigqs.
who were not involved had their freedom to travel in Latin amer fy

ca, and their access to government people and their general

academic business compromised. Then there was a whale of

pepercomnaey

objections that came forth out of this.
Mr, Maxwell. I think at least. to be realistic about hig,

regardless of what kind cf promulgation this committee ma ’ an

as to the use of academics, there are relatively few societies
in the world that will take at face value the notion that
visitors from another country who come to be studying there are
not in some way tied to the government. And I think the beiigf
that we can convince any country in Latin America that

visiting academics are not going to report to the Government
through this kind of promulgation, I think, is a bit naive,

and it may be dishonorable to do.

the Agency would prohibit-itself from making operational use of
these individuals, plus the generic exposure, if you will, so
that the academic community is aware of the magnitude, if you
will, or the scope of the problem. :

Xt have been reminded by one of the other attorneys, that the

that if you eliminate their ability to recruit at the campuses,
you will eliminate 50 percent of their annual recruitment

here which I think we probably ought to -- I mean, if the B
committee can address them seriatum. One is, do we want
have the Government itself place some limit on its relationship
with academics, its relationship, which is clandestine and
covert, and if the answer’ to that question is yes, then the
answer to that question is how would one do that? Would one
do a law, shielding legislation which may raise certain
kinds of questions, including constitutionaiity, or what have
you, or do we want to recommend that the Agency itself put
the people off limits, would necessarily do anything except
institute policies which any Agency should have concerning
journalists or any number of people.

Mr. Miller. Well, let me raise a question, David, which
really may go to the point.

We heard from, is we discussed earlier, a number of views

of the President and so on, and as I recall that evening

was that they don't want any laws, definitely.

On the other hand, they wanted to know whac the hell was
going on so that they could govern themselves, and that puts it
in a nutshell.

Won't the effect of this report, assuming that it is
printed and it is public, provide the university community with
an awareness of what is going on?

Mr. Kirbow. You mean without a recommendation, just the
finding that it has been done.

Mr. Miller. Well, I am just raising the question fox,
discussion. Will the report itself provide notice that ffee
things are going on and allow the university community to
govern itselft in whatever way. In certain areas it won't
make any difference, and in other areas it will.

Or is it necessary to take one of those alternatives which
is either internal prchibitions on the agencies, ana the
further step is a statute. i

And it seems to me that if you weigh those three possi-
bilities, you-may cone to. an answer.

_Mr. Aaron. Well, i chink there is one problem with ‘the
first step. It's just a problem, I'm not saying that it is
an insuperable problem, but the problem is one I think that
Charlie put his finger on earlier, and that is the question of

witting. But we do nave 41 individuals who are being used

for operational purposes who are academics who do aot kiiow

it, and we have -- I think there are &2 institutions i which
no one outside of the operative himself, who may not know it --
we just don't know how these numbers break out -- or the
institution doesn't know it.

Now, it may well be that our report is so widely read that
all institutions will nave a chance to look at themselves and
ask these questions, but chere is a problem in the problem of
witting and unwitting, as Charlie points out.

Mr.. Kirbow, Weli, I. think none of the opposition to
these. two recommendations at no‘ time has said we shall ma iain
ithese aeviteing relationship, but I.do feel very strongly gat:
the university management, whatever it is, and it can't
be very difficult co find out who is. running the shop, [I would
think, and the individual himself are both witting, that we

should not prohibit the Agency from this very, extremely
valuable resource, povtorning this foreign. intelligence
function. ‘

Senator Huddleston. Well, you know, really, to get
back -- the major evil as I see it was the recruiting of
ident a. foreign. student who comes. to. the.States presumably
to get an education, and whether he is recruited by another

student, a member of the faculty or a CIA agent, a local

businessman or a bar tender,.it seems to me that is the

major evil, I think. ‘lt is the subversion of the student who

is’ sent over here, unwittingly sent over here for one purpose,

in our iastitutions of higher learning, and is subjecred to
this effort.

And I am not ready to say that we ought to eliminate
that, but'it seems to me tnat we really are after the problem
that we are not totally addressing it by zeroing in on the
academics. All we are doing is making it ‘harder for them to
do it, I guess.

Mr, Aaron, Well, I think that is correct. If that ig whad
you-see as the principle evil, you really have to go to the

question of recruitiments.

Senator Mathias. But the response to my question to Besind
the evil, I think we weric- wider, and we talked about the taint.

Senator Huddlestcn. We are not corrupting a faculty mem-
ber.

Mr. Aaron. I think my definition of the wider evil would

encompass the question of the professor representing himself

las being something other than what he represents himself to

be, both to the student and to the public at large, and I

do think I would share Bill's view, even though I am not an

|| academic, that they have a special responsibility in our

society, and because of that responsibility I don't believe
the government should be in a position of trying to detract
from that. responsibility, which is a way I think you can argue
that this kind of clandestine effort would do.

If you want to get ut the other problem, though, of

Senator Huddleston. Well, I think that's just an extension

of the problem. I think it's reazly a difficult recommenda-

tion, and:I am inclined te lean toward: Bill Bader's suggestion
with the caveat of the wittingness of the institution,

here, recruiting of siudents --

Mr. Aaron. Propayanda is another one.

is pointing out.

to American faculty mempers and saying, will you tell us about
any students here, and that is using that faculty member for
an operational purpose, and then it is employing those

faculty members or other members of the academic community
during the leave of absence, when they go overseas or somewhere
else.

There are so many different things here, and.some have
greater or lesser degrees of evil and desirability. that I'm
not sure that these two brief, you know, that we are taking
into account all of the subtleties... : -

Mr. Bader. All cf these fall under the Agency's term§gology
as the operational use of the individual, namely, to find
each of these practices as béing more or less acceptable, but
they are all operational.

Mr. Kelley. Maybe r'm saying that a blanket ban is too
blunt an. instrument, <nd maybe we don't have the tine to
analyze each one of the things we are veally talking about
and apply the kind of precision to them to accomplish what
we want, and therefore it may be something for the oversight
committee to study.

Mr. Kirbow. I would suggest the third option, as the
Chairman said, that it not be’ prohibition but it be in allowing
practices where both witting individuals and witting institutio

Mr. Bader. Well, Mc. Chairman, the problem: with that is
as far as witting institutions are concerned in an economic
community, you cannot argue the case that -- well, you'can
argue the case, but it cannot be a very sustained argument
that- in an academic community, by having one or more; a few
individuals somewhere in a university administration being
aware that certain faculty members are being used for recruits
ment purposes, that you make the institutions --

Senator Huddleston. Well, I would assume it would be-

the president or the chairman of the board. EN

Mr. Aaron. Well, 1 think Bill's point is that they are
mot hierarchical organizations like making the cognizant
commander aware of whicn his troop is doing.

Senator Huddleston. Well, the president can say no, can't
he?

Mr. Kirbow. And he can put out a Hoedee to his fagulty
that this institution does or doesn't. I don't think there's
any institution that. isn't managed by somebody, isn't: there?

Ms._Culbreath., Just this. one.

Mr. Davis. A subset of that problem is how a university
would know that it's a covert problem, and the -- I mean, while
you were supposed to inform people of what you are doing, if.it

is a covert contract, it's not entirely clear how the university

‘Mr. Davis. Well, then, if the president said no.

Senator Huddleston. Well, that really doesn't address the

a chance to say no.

Hart's first amendment question over the night. I think we

have kicked this one around about as far as we are going to

kick it.

be included into the report, that goes to the full Committee,
including the option of prohibition by law.

question publicly? I'm not sure the great body of the American
public or the great body of the world eS

Mr. Miller. The more I listen to this,:just our own recactic
and we are peoplé that have been working with the problem for
a year. It seems to me that the exposure of the question
may do far more than any prohibition.

Senator Mathias. The only problem with that, Bill, is that
that may be of limited duration.

Mr. Aaron. Well, in addition to these options, then, it

seems to me there ought to. be an option which says that these

operational uses would be permitted as long as the individual
were witting and some, maybe as you say, the chairman of the
board of trustees, or the presidents ie their equivalents, were
notified of the relationship.

Mr. Kirbow. Or regulations to that effect.

Mr, Aaron.. In other words, the internal regulations of
the CIA would be to that effect, and is there a fourth
option, that there should be a prohibition on any recruitment
of foreign students in the United States?

Is that a reasonable thing that the Committee ought to
at ?

consider as well? i

Mr. Kirbow. I think the Senator said he wasn't willing
to go quite that far right now.

Senator Huddleston. & may be by tomorrow morning.

Mr, Maxwell, May I mention one more thing?

Most of this has focused on recruitment of students, which
I think is. an extruordinarily aiseieactiasce because of the
value that is claimed by the Agency for that, and I think
my own, at least, ignorance about alternative means of doing ~
it. The issue of another evil which is an issue that Bill
has used about the possible use of academics to write propa~
ganda is I think a somewhat simpler issue, because I think
that may get more directly, at least more directly than
finding simply a list of foreign students and providing it

to the Agency, to the is.ue of how that affects the academic

community, and a situation in which an academic may in fact
be writing propaganda, putting out material that other’ people
in the academic community don't know is essentially by.
Senator Huddleston. Well, they have indicated to us that
they have discontinued that, that they have put nothing out
that is not attributed in the first place.
Mr. Kirbow. Sir, many of these people used to write
articles and whatnot for use overseas, so it has nothing to
do with the use in the United States, and they rely a great
deal on this type of contact for specialists in certain areas
to have an appeal to the people. t
Now, whether or not that does them much good is a question
that is debated in the Agency a great deal, but the third

option would include what you said there; and a fourth, if you

want to put it down here, to go before the full Committee, is

a total prohibition against recruiting foreign students.

But I think if we could have until maybe tomorrow afternoon
this constitutional question on that one issue is going to
get.a little more complex.

Mr. Inderfurth. Will the Supreme Court sit before
tomorrow?,

Mr. Kirbow. No, sir, but Mr. Schwarz will be here

earlier.

can tonight, I believe.

Mr. Kirbow. That we are going to put the whole «cademic
question under further consideration tomorrow?

Mr. Aaron. Including this one?

Senator Huddleston. Academics for operational purposes?

Mr, Kirbow. On top of page 59, say, they're talking about
the use of cultural grantees of all U.S. government sponsored
peogeanal .

Mr. Aaron. The point of that being the Congress and the
executive branch, for that matter, makes grants for education
Pele tet sorts of cultural exchange programs that don't: involve
academics, the athletes, artists and whomever for certain kinds

of specified purposes there, for Hands Across the Border purpos

and what have you, and if these are used for clandestine
purposes, in effect they would iE cagneent sn overt programs

and there is some question as to whether the Congress wishes
these programs to be so used, and that is really the question
the Committee has to tace up to. Do we want to permit those
programs, some of those programs, clear to the Fulbright
program ~~ I know there's a prohibition on it. The question is
whether that prohibition ought to apply to others.

Mr. Inderfurth, well, my comment to him was I thcught
the discussions of the National Security and the role af the
DCI in covert action, what we're discussing now, should be the
most lengthy discussions, IG recommendations would go quicker,
but will these all be done by Friday?

how we can do it unless we do meet twice a day. Hopefully we
won't have to go any more nights.

10:00 and 2:00 suits me, but tomorrow we'll comin

we have covered so far is the vast bulk of those, the hard
issue.

may I raise a point?

I think that one of the important questions here is the
extent to which you want to look back at what you've done, In
other words, we have been sent away to prepare and redraft
certain recommendations concerning the charter of the CIA;
for example concerning whether the DCI should wear both :
hats and so forth, At some point we must, I think, leave some
time in the schedule to look either at all of those changes
at once, or to spend a little time each day looking at the day
before's work, in assuring that in fact that is what we ail
want to do.

Senator Huddleston... I would rather get it all done and
then take a half a day where wa might, where each one of us --
are you retyping as yeu go along?

Mr, Aaron. We aeclivet sain as we go along.
