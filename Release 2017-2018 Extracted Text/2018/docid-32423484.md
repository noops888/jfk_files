MEMORANDUM FOR SENIOR STAFF

SUBJECT: Summary of Significant Documents Retried from the Lyndon

Baines Johnson Library, Austin, Texas

FROM: Loch Johnson

I have just returned from a trip to the LBJ Library where I in-

spected the National Security Files. I was allowed to examine the files

dealing with U.S. policy toward Cuba, the Johnson Vice Presidential

Security files, and NSC minutes. The Library staff sifted through the

Bundy papers for me, extracting anything relevant to Cuba for my inspection.

I was not permitted to examine either the Bundy papers or the Rostow

papers myself, since the Library has not yet cleard them.

Similarly, I

was unable to examine the Vietnam country files or the Lass country files

because we have not been given authority to do so yet.

Though these roadblocks were frustrating, I found I had my hands

filled for the moment simply working my way through the papers which

were available. I selected 44 documents to bring home, totaling 208

pages.

These documents range from a verification of information we

already know to some useful new information (see Items 21 and 22, e.g.)

to some startling new leads in the area of covert action (see Item

28): What follows is a capsule summary of each document presented in

chronological order. High priority items have tabs marked in red.

SUMMARY OF JOHNSON LIBRARY DOCUMENTS

NSC Minutes, 5 May 1961 and NSC Record of Actions, 16 May 1961.

At the 5 May NSC meeting, Rusk

suggested that the U. S. must take

all measures to precipitate Castro's downfall or face the possibility

that all South America will come under Communist influence.

On the subject of Trufillo, the President said (25 days before the

dictator was murdered) that the U. S. should draw the line on becoming

involved

in the affairs of another country, such as active participation

in the overthrow of Trujillo. Instead, the United States should determine

appropriate courses of action in case Trujillo falls.

The 16 May Record of Actions emphasizes it was the President's view

that the U. S. should not initiate the overthrow of Trujillo before we

knew what government would succeed him. This same document outlines

U. S. policy toward Cuba; it was agreed that U. S. policy toward Cuba

should aim at the downfall of Castro, though specific mention of assas-

sination is not to be found among the many options outlined.

2. Letter from Lodge to Rusk, 13 September (1963?).

In an obviously anti-Diem letter, Lodge asks Rusk to send General

Lansdale to South Vietnam Nam to take charge of all U. S. relationships

with a change of government. Why Lodge so confidentally expected a

change of government is an interesting question.

3. A note from Bromley Smith to George Christian (undated, but presumably

early in the Johnson Administration, perhaps December, 1963).

A good example of the establishment of plausible deniability for the

President, at the suggestion of the CIA.

4. Memo from Chase dated 2 December 1963 and probably for Bundy.

Among other things, Chase recommends "a vigorous, tough, and nasty

policy" against Cuba, Including strengthening the covert action program

and continuing to explore "every avenue in order to make life as diffi-

cult for Castro and as expensive and unpleasant for the USSR as possible."

Moreover, "We should be prepared to meet any event which might offer the

opportunity of a sudden overthrow of Castro (e.g., the shooting down of

a U-2)."

5. Memo from Chase to Bundy, 4 December 1963.

Plans for a meeting regarding Cuban policy. John Crimmins will

present several options for discussion, including unleashing of Cuban

exiles and the intensification of the covert program.

6. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 December 1963.

This memo is mainly important because it reveals who in the Admin-

Istration was dealing with Cuban policy.

The list of people to attend

the meeting on Cuba held this. day included:

Lyndon B. Johnson, Rusk,

Ed Martin, McNamara, McCone, Helms or Des Fitzgerald, Don Wilson, Bundy,

and Chase.

7. Memo, Bundy to Lyndon B. Johnson, 12 December 1963.

For a press conference, Bundy recommends the following language re-

garding Cuba:

...say...that you expect to take every available means

to stop and turn

back the spread of Communism in this hemisphere."

• 8. CIA Summary of Costs for Cuban Operations, FY 1960-1964, dated 15

December 1963.

This table reveals that the CIA spent $106,155,774 on Cuban Opera-

tions, almost 50 percent of which was spent on paramilitary action

($47,815,122) •

The total covert action budget (psychological and para-

military

warfare) was approximately $81,000,000 in this four-year period.

9. Chase minutes on meeting with Lyndon B. Johnson, 27 December 1963.

The meeting appears to be the first major briefing for the new Presi-

dent on Cuba..

Desmond Fitzgerald did most of the briefing, which in-

cluded a detailed description of CIA assets in Cuba, proposed sabotage plans,

and

attempts by the CIA to stimulate an internal coup which would

dislodge Castro.

The CIA was aiding two exile groups in particular:

one led by Manuel Artime, the other by Manolo Ray.

_Bundy recommends

that Lyndon B. Johnson take "a more vigorous line toward Cuba/ than

we have in the past."

10. Memo, Bundy to Lyndon B. Johnson, 9 January 1964.

Bundy recommends a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle of

covert sabotage against Cuba.

He notes that Rusk and McNamara do not

support the program of sabotage, while "McCone and the CIA are for it,

and so are most of the middle-level officers dealings with the Castro

problem."

Bundy concludes: "'...In your position, I would stop sabotage

attacks on the ground that they are illegal, ineffective, and damaging

to our broader policy."

11. A second copy of the above memo.

12. Memo and attachment on Cuban policy from John W. Ford, FSO, to

Bundy, dated 18 February 1964.

The lengthy attachment appears to be a working paper on Cuba prepared

for Bundy by Rostow's staff in State.

The authors

write:

"If we are to be realistic about our intent to get rid of the

cancerous potential of Castroism, 1s an attack on the symptoms enough?

Is it not essential to get at the disease itself?" (10). And, later,

....if we were publicly to acknowledge the extinction of the Castro

regime/ as our aim, would not a sudden blow seem a more logical way of

proceeding then the application of measured pressures?" (14). The paper

discusses the need for a plausible causus for action against Castro, asking

the question:

"would not a better bet be to provoke one?" (16). They

suggest that "something like the assassination of a prominent Latin American

leader"' (17a) would be sufficient provocation, if blamed on Castro, to permit

U.S. action.

13. Memo, Chase to Bundy, with various attachments, no date, but probably

early March, 1964. Subject: Cuba, Covert Program.

Of special interest here is the attached letter from Desmond Fitz-

Gerald to Bundy, dated March 1964.

"Des" implies that CIA efforts to get

rid of Castro were carried out "only in response to what we understand to

be policy requirements...." (1). He makes the point that CIA-sponsored

sabotage raids were to serve as "a sort of firing pin for internal unrest

and to create the conditions

for a coup." However, only five low-key raids

were carried out (from August to December, 1963), followed by a three-month

hiatus. Des concludes that "a covert program at this time designed to

overthrow Castro is not realistic" (2). He does recommend, however, con-

tinuation of certain covert actions, each as " carefully concealed con-

tamination of lubricants" shipped into Cuba and "similar actions" (4).

A second attachment is a "Status Report on Autonomous Cuban Exile

Groups"', dated 30 March 1964, which underscores how truly autonomous

these

groups really were; the CIA had lost control over them by this time.

The third attachment is a CIA "Review of Current Program of Covert Action

Against Cuba," dated "about 1/25/64."

The ultimate goal of the CIA program

was "to stimulate dissident elements within the regime, particularly

in the armed forces, to carry out a coup"' (7);

The time frame for the

program was "about eighteen months from June 1963"' (7). The report notes

that the CIA has "continued to improve our own infiltration techniques

and

are still able to penetrate Cuba's defenses with good regularity"

(13-14). The five sabotage raids on Cuba run by CIA are listed at Annex I.

The final attachment is an unsigned report on "Spectrum of Courses

of Action with Respect to Cuba,

CiA document Respects can tee A Febte effect, had proere is no

point in discussing courses of action with respect to Cuba until the

fundamental decision is made as to whether or not it is possible for the

United States to live with Cuba." Without answering this question, the report

sets out a series of options or courses of action under two headings: (1)"Can and

Can't Live with Castro." Under the latter, the options range from covert

sabotage to invasion, but do not mention assassination of Castro.

Memo, Chase to Bundy, 23 March 1964, with attachments. subject: U.s.

Policy Towards Cuba, April to November, 1964.

Chase still recommends "the tough, nasty, but no military intervention/

blockade policy...." (7). The policy will include "a modest covert program'

(11). CIA sabotage efforts will be terminated, though the Agency will continue

trying to identify, seek out, and establish contact with potential dissident

non-Conmunist elements in the power centers of the Castro regime.

The possi-

bilities of talking with Castro are viewed positively (12). Chase suggests

that the realities of domestic political considerations "reinforce our

national security decision to keep a reasonable amount of pressure on Cuba...."

(15) •

15. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 7 April 1964.

Crimmins warns Chase that infiltration/exfiltration problems may create

noise regarding U.S. covert programs against Cuba.

16. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 10 April 1964, with attachment.

More discussions on the possibility of opening talks with Castro.

The attachment emphasizes the true autonomy from the CIA of the autonomous

exile groups.

Memo, Bundy to LBJ, 17 April 1964, with attachment (Memo, Taylor to LBJ,

March 1964).

The Taylor memo notes that LBJ asked the JCS on 4 March 1964. to think

of new ways to (1)gain OAS support for the overthrow of Castro and (2)

bring additional pressure upon Castro. Taylor concludes that the JCS "have

difficulty identifying promising actions against Castro which have not been

previously considered, and in some cases tried. It is a hard fact," Taylor

continues, "that little remains which offers premise of real effectiveness

in removing Castro short of a blockade or an ascending scale of military

action up to or including invasion."

18. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 21 April 1964.

Notes that Alexis Johnson is in charge of contingency planning for a coup

in Cuba.

19. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 14 May 1964..

This memo suggests that a primary goal of the Johnson Administration was

the noise level. The memo makes it clear that the exile raids were becoming

completely beyond U.S. control despite CIA financial support to the groups.

20. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 June 1964.

Chase notes that Castro has executed three anti-Castro Cubans and jailed

two others as CIA agents. CIA admits having a connection with the executed

Cubans "but that it is completely deniable."

Memo, Helms, DDP, to DCI, 10 June 1964. Subject: "Plans of Cuban

Exiles to Assassinate Selected Cuban Government Leaders"

The CIA was made aware of certain plans to kill Castro. The Agency told

the sources, according to Helms, that "the United States Government would not,

under any circumstances, condone the planned actions.". Apparently on 2 March

1964 a wealthy Cuban exile was approached with a Cosa Nostra offer to assassinate

Castro for $150,000.

The wealthy exile turned down the offer. Similar offers

were make to other Cuban exiles in early March. A leading tigure in the

negotiations was Byron Cameron, a shipping-businessmen from Ft. Lauderdale.

An agreement was finally made to pay the Cameron group $100,000 for killing

-Castro, plus $2,500 for expenses.

exile in New York was to pay much of the money, and did pay the $2,500 on

pay much ot tho

Julio Lobo Olavarria, a wealthy Cuban

25 April. Though Cameron's group remained anonymous, it was clear the Matia

was involved. Cameron revealed that his contact was a police officer in the

St. Louis (Mo.) Vice Squad.

Memo, Chase to Bundy, 15 June 1964. Subject: "Assassination of Castro."

Referring to the above memo from DDP to DCI, Chase notes that John

Crimmins feels the matter should be discussed at a Special Group meeting.

## Page 10

'John's own inclination is that the U.S. Government cannot knowingly permit

any criminal American involvement in this sort of thing,

11 notes Chase,

"and should go all out to stop the plot." In marginal notations, Bundy

agrees with John and with the need to forward the matter to the Special

Group •

23. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 16 June 1964, with attachment (Des FitzGerald's

"A Reappraisal of Autonomous Operations") .

FitzGerald makes a defense of the autonomous operations. Tom Mann and

Chase disapprove of the operations, though for different reasons.

24. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 18 June 1964.

Chase warns that further U.S. support of the autonomous groups is more

likely to lead to a U-? shootdown and a Caribbean crisis than the overthrow

of the Castro regime.

Chase continues to be worried about noice levels

and the November election. This memo is very much like his 14 May memo

(see Item 19).

Memo for the Record, Peter Jessup, 22 June 1964.

In a reference to Helm's memo on assassination (see Item 21), it was

pointed out in a 303 Committee meeting of 18 June that "these reports, in

effect, put the United States Government on notice that fallure to take

preventive action could be construed as condonation. " The AG said Justice

would look into the matter.

26. Memo, McCone to Bundy, 19 August 1964.

McCone summarizes the FBI investigation of Cuban exile plots against

Castro as outlined in Helm's memo of 19 June (See Item 21).

The Bureau

interviewed many

people allegedly involved, most of whom denied the existence

of such a plan (The Bureau did not interview Cameron, since he was out of

the country). The most interesting finding was that Lobo had in fact

discussed the matter with CIA.

27. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 10 November 1964.

The election past, Chase et al. agreed that 'we can usefully do some

basic review work on Cuba." FitzGerald pushes for re-institution of CIA-

directed covert program.

28)

Memo, R.C. Bowman to Bundy, 12 November 1964, with JCS attachment

dated 30 October 1964. Subject: SQUARE DANCE

A contemptable proposal intiated by the Army to use germ warfare against

Cuban sugar and livestock. Bowman and Bundy agree that the White House should

"remain aloof from formal consideration of 'Square Dance' at this stage."

I believe this plan for covert action is even more shocking and unacceptable

than plans for assassination.

Memo, Chase to Bundy, 12 November 1964, and attachment (apparently

Bundy memo for a meeting with LBJ on 7 April 1964).

The Bundy memo suggests that LBJ approved various options "short of

war to get rid of the Castro regime," including the possible contamination

of sensitive Cuban imports (not food). The Chase memo indicates that a

Fitzgerald operation was underway in November 1964 to ship contaminating

elements into Cuba.

30. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 30 December 1964.

The Artime group is out of control, though State, Defense and CIA

(as well as Bundy) all agree that it would be unwise to try to interfere

with him at this stage.

31. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 5 January 1965.

Chase reports a plan told to Crimmins and the CIA about an Artime plot

to stage a "palace coup" during which Castro and other top leaders would be

"neutralized." D-Day was to be March 13.

This matter was to be discussed

at an upcoming Special Group meeting on whether or not "to cut off Artime's

water."

Chase notes: "CIA at this point is loath to make a hard evaluation

of the Artime/Cubela plot."

32. Memo to 303 Committee,

unsigned, 18 January 1965, presumably a CIA

document.

Discusses the virtues of continuing Underwater Demolition Teams against

ships in Cuban harbors.

If such activities are disallowed, the CIA should

be authorized to reduce its commitment in the paramilitary field.

33. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 8 February

1965.

This memo indicates that not even Artime had his group in control. The

memo also discusses CIA covert activities in British Guiana, such as pene-

trating the PPP and proping up the democratic trade unionism.

Memo, Murat. Williams (INR) to Peter Jessup, White House staff,

23 February 1965.

Recommends immediate termination of Artime support.

35. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 March 1965

Discussion of who is for maintaining a covert capability against Cuba

(presently on the shelf) and who is opposed. Chase guessed that CIA would

be opposed ("fish or cut bait"); State would not.

Rusk's general attitude

toward Cuba at this time was to keep the temperature low while sorting out

the Vietnam problem.

DöcҐđ:32423484

Memo, Chase to Bundy, 4 March 1965:

Chase recommends phasing out support to Artime. The CIA is consider-

ing diluting pesticides sent to Cuba; this is similar to the kinds of tactics

mentioned in Items 28 and 29 above and are a manifestation of the moral

bankruptcy of U.S. policy.

Also some talk here of backing a new exile

group, RECE, though not much enthusiasm for the idea from anyone apparently.

Oddly, CIA wishes to drop its paramilitary capability, while Dod and State

want the capability maintained.

37. Memo, Grant Hilliker (State) to Bundy, 18 June 1965.

This is a summary of U.S. policy toward Cuba.

The ultimate objective

Is still to replace the Castro regime. The memo notes that "the paramilitary

program involving CIA-controlled actions was set aside even before it really

started."

38. Memo, Bundy

to LBJ, 26 June 1965.

Adm. Raborn recommends reactivation of a paramilitary effort against

Cuba.

Bundy, Tommy Thompson, Rusk, McNamara, and Cy Vance are against this

chiefly because of the concomitant international noise level.

"Most of us, "Bundy

writes, "do not recommend visible violent actions against Cuba." Raborn's

recommendations

said nothing about assassination.

39. Memo, Rostow to LBJ, 30 May 1966.

Rostow notifies the President that a CIA exfiltration mission ran into

ambush and the agents were

captured. The President could expect "the noise

level of Castro's charges of 'threatened Yankee aggression' may go up."

40. Memo, Karamessines, DDP, to Rostow, 7 August 1967.

This memo is important because it lists the names of two or three Cubans

who worked on CIA missions. If they are in the U.S., it may be worthwhile

talking to them about their activities.

41. Memo, W.G. Bowdler to Rostow, 18 December 1967.

The new CIA emphasis is on developing contacts within Castro's inner

circle.

Dave Phillips was to be in charge of the new CIA Cuba program.

Bowdler advises that "we be alert to indications that Castro is looking for

accommodation or his disillusioned

lieutenants want to know where we stand

if they move to dump him."

Memo, Helms to LBJ, 12 June 1968.

Carlos Prio, former President of Cuba, is sponsoring a plan to

assassinate Castro.

Two Cubans have infiltrated Cuba from Miami to

implement the assassination.

"CIA has nothing whatever to do with these

attempts," writes Helms, "and learns of them only through penetration

of Cuban exile groups."

43)

Memo, Rostow to LBJ, 20 June 1968.

"CIA, Defense, and State agreed that, should an assassination or

an

assassination attempt take place, the U.S. skirts should be clean,'

writes Rostow. Therefore, State warned Cuban authorities via the Swiss

that reports had been received on a Castro assassination attempt.

So by

1968 we were warning Castro of attempts on his life!

44. CIA Intelligence Report, 18 November 1968.

...there is little chance...that a

plot against the

(Castro) regime

could

succeed

in the foreseeable future." (14).

NOTES

Meeting of National Security Council, 5 May 1961

The President directed the establishment of a task force to study

the Iranian problem and suggested that Mr. Talbot head the group.

Mr. Rusk pointed out that General Bakhtiar visited the United States

comparatively recently and that a coup involving him would possibly

embarrass the United States. The President discounted the possibility. .

The President directed that a group study the Korean problem and

report its findings within two weeks. Mr. McConaughy will head the

group of Defense, CIA, State and Treasury representatives. Mr.

McNamara appointed Mr. William Bundy to represent Defense.

The President asked Mr. Nitze for a report on the Cuban situation.

Nitze replied that the Navy could blockade the island but results would not

be immediate but rather long-range, and in the course the reof unfavorable

world reaction would probably accrue. Admiral Burke pointed out that

only complete interception of all ships approaching Cuba would achieve

eventual success, and the job could be done with 24 ships. Mr. Rusk

interrupted Admiral Burke to point out that such action would be an act

of war and was wholly impracticable.

The President asked about a reported letter from Senator Goldwater

in which the statement is made that the Air Force could resolve the Cuban

situation. Admiral Burke replied that there had in fact been an Air Force

proposal with which other services had disagreed, especially the Marines.

In any case, the Air Force had made the suggestion that the Cuban problem

be resolved through rather heavy and perhaps indiscriminate bombardment.

The President immediately rejected such an idea, and added further that

there would be no Navy blockade. He emphasized the importance of more

effective watch committee action on Cuba. He also asked Mr. Dulles what

new information was available on foreign equipment going into Cuba.

Mr. Dulles replied that we know practically everything about the equipment,

but offered no specifics. The President directed that close surveillance

be continued including overflight with an American pilot. The President

approved flights of a frequency of every two or three days, but suggested

extreme caution.

The President suggested that all Americans be urged to leave Cuba

and asked Secretary Johnson to study ways and means of exit and transit

visas.

MI. Murrow assessed world-wide reactions to the U.S. position

with regard to Cuba. He felt that the departure of the clergy, the reign

of terror, and such incidents as the imprisonment in the theater will

result in favorable reactions toward the U.S. and tend to considerably

offset the unfavorable ones. He felt that world-wide impressions of the

United States were improving generally. The President suggested that

the Iranian issue might be interpreted abroad as a possible result of

the failure of the U.S. to act in Laos. He suggested action by USIA to

discount this possible impression. Secretary Rusk suggested the over-

riding theme of U.S. rejection of Castro and went on to say that the U.S.

must take all measures to precipitate his downfall or face the possibility

that all South America will come under Communist influence.

The President asked what specific courses of action we should take

to prevent the crippling influence of the Cuban fiasco, assuming that no

military action by the U.S. will be taken. At the same time the President

asked what circumstances would have to exist before the United States

could move unilaterally against Cuba. Rusk stated that action could be

taken under Article 51 of the Rio Treaty. In this connection the President

asked if the U.S. could recognize the Cuban Government in Exile and what

might be expected of this group. Rusk replied that such recognition was

not possible because of the absence of certain essential elements of a

governmental organization, identity and territory. The question then

arose as to the status of the Cubans in the United States and Robert

Kennedy replied that they should be designated refugees and

legislation exists to handle them under this designation. The Department

of. HEW will begin registering the refugees with the assistance of CIA.

The President stated that the United States will invoke the Trading With

the Enemy Act across the board as far as Cuba is concerned at such time

as some overt act or incident occurs in Cuba. The President gave as an

example the shooting of a United States citizen. The President would

exempt from the restrictions of the Act some $30 million for food and

drugs.. At the suggestion of Mr. Fowler, Under Secretary of the Treasury,

the drugs should be donated to the Cuban people through the Red Cross.

The President suggested the acceptance of the policy to encourage all

Latin American states to sever relations with Cuba and to establish a

complete economic boycott. The United States however should draw the

line on becoming involved in the affairs of another country, such as active

participation in the overthrow of Trujillo. Instead, the United States

should determine appropriate courses of action in case Trujillo falls.

The common danger in Haiti should be included in these considerations.

Saigon, September 13

Dear Dean:

I ask that youshow this letter to the President personally,

as it is vital that it not get into the governmental paper mill. for

maximum security I an typing itsemyself and am sending it to you by

messenger.

What I ask is that General Lansale be sent over here at once

to take charge, under uy supervision, of all U.S. relationships with a change

of government here.To function efficiently he must have a staff and I

therefore ask that he be put in charge of the CAS station in the Embassy,

relieving

the present incumbent, kir. John Richardson.

This is said without

casting any reflection on lir. Richardson.

Indeed I think of him as a devoted, intelligent and patriotic American. If

his loyal support in the past of the U.S. policy of winning the mar vi th

Diem has made it difficult for him to carry out a different policy now,

he has never said so or showed it.If,as I am inclined to think, Vietnamese

have naturally suspected him of being pro-Dien,it has not been his fault.

ly request to put General Lansdale in his place is not because

I have: anything but braise of Mir.Richardson, but because of uy belief that

me need a new face and that Geherallansdale has outstanding qualifications.

But I hope John McCone will be told my my nigh regard for l.

Richardson.

CAS telegram FVS-9617, September ll,is the most encouraging report

I have seen since arriving in Vietnam.And it is confirmed by a wholly

independant source in whon I have great confidence.

No written answer to this letter is necessary General Lansdale's

arrival will be a more than adequate response.

I hope you will tell the President how much I value his message

contained in Deptel 396.

With warm regards

As ever yours

The most pertinent reference to a Presidential reply at a news

conference with respect to alleged agent activities of the CIA in

Cuba is one dated October 31, 1963 at President Kennedy's news

conference at which the following question was put to him:

Question: Mr. President, Fidel Castro claims to have

captured some Americans whom he says are CIA agents,

and he says he is going to execute them.. Is there anything

at all that you can tell us about this?

The President: No, no.

It would seem that this is the proper reply for the President to make

to such a question, and we would suggest that, if the question arises

at a White House news conference a similar reply be made. If the

President or the press secretary wish to make a fuller statement,

it might be along the following lines:

"I see no useful purpose to be served by any comment

I might make on such allegations."

U.S. Policy. Towards Cuba

1. The objective of our policy is a free Cuba which poses no threat to its

neighbors; we do not intend to coexist with a Soviet satellite in this hemis-

phere. In moving towards this objective, we have rejected the option of

unprovoked U.S. armed intervention in Cuba. Instead, we are engaged in

a variety of unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral measures, both defensive

and offensive in nature, which stop short of invasion.

2. Our defensive measures primarily aim at three targets. First, we are

intent on ensuring that Cuba does not become again a military threat to the

U.S. or Latin America. To this end, we conduct intensive air and sea sur-

veillance over and around Cuba. So far as we know, we have been entirely,

successful in this effort. Second, we are intent, for domestic political, as

well as national security reasons, on effecting the removal of all Soviet mil-

itary personnel from Cuba. To this end, we have made it eminently clear

to the Soviets on numerous occasions that we cannot tolerate the permanent

assignment of Soviet t roops to Cuba. As a result of Soviet self-interest and

our pressures, there are now 4-7, 000 Soviet military personnel remaining

in Cuba, representing a drop of about 65-75% from the peak reached in the

autumn of 1962. Needless to say, the issue remains a highly delicate one,

especially in view of the fact that at any moment the Russians could arbitrarily

decide to send more troops back into Cuba.

Third, we are intent on impeding and, if possible, stopping Cuban-based and

supported subversion of the Hemisphere. To this end, we have made a special

effort, bilaterally and in multilateral forums, to direct the Latin American

attention to and to assist (materially, where appropriate) Latin American

efforts in the problem of controlling the subversive movement of people, funds,

arms, and propaganda between Latin America and Cuba. We have had some

success; one small measure is that, primarily through the use of travel con-

trols by Latin American governments, there has been a 50% drop, over the

past year, in the number of Latin Americans traveling to Cuba. On the other

hand, with Castro still exceedingly intent on producing "another Cuba" in the

Hemisphere and with many Latin American governments still unwilling or

unable to cope effectively with subversive efforts, much remains to be done.

In this regard, proper exploitation of the discovery of the Cuban arms cache

in Venezuela might take us a long way towards getting whole-hearted Latin

American cooperation in the fight against subversion; such cooperation is a

vital key to success in this field.

3. Offensively, our ultimate target is to remove the Soviet satellite from

the Hemisphere. We hope we can achieve this by concentrating on three

intermediate targets -- intensifying Cuba's already-serious economic dif-

ficulties; increasing the cost and unpleasantness to the Soviets of maintain-

ing Cuba; and stimulating direct and indirect internal resistance to the regime.

Our chief weapons for achieving these offensive targets are two -- isolation

measures and covert measures (which, of course, also have an impact on

our defensive targets).

(a) The most outstanding characteristic of our isolation measures is

that they are exceedingly difficult to implement -- primarily because imple-

mentation depends on the cooperation of others and not merely on U.S. will.

Nevertheless, we have been suprisingly successful in implementation; while

one could have reasonably expected our isolation policy to break up as the

world moved away from the heat of October, 1962, in fact, this has not hap-

pened. Instead, over the past year, our isolation policy generally held the

ground already made in some fields, while making further progress in others.

About a year ago, only five OAS countries maintained diplomatic relations

with Cuba; the number not only remains the same now but the anticipated OAS

reaction to the discovery of the Cuban arms cache in Venezuela gives some

reason to hope for further ruptures. Free World shipping to Cuba in 1963

has fallen off by roughly 60% from the 1962 level; prospects for further re-

duction are good. The low level of Free World trade with Cuba, reached in

1962, has generally been maintained in 1963. Air isolation of Cuba has been

fairly successful; a dramatic demonstration of this. is the fact that many Latin

Americans have had to travel to and from Cuba via Prague.

The effectiveness of our isolation measures in hitting the target

is impos-

sible to gauge accurately.

While Hurricane Flora, in a few days, probably hit

the target more squarely than our isolation measures did in a whole year, it

is generally agreed that the economic chaos which now exists in Cuba and the

enormity of the Soviet aid bill is, in part at least, due to our efforts. Castro's

repeated and loud public protestations about our isolation policy and his serious

and strenuous efforts

to break out of Free World isolation substantiate the view

that the isolation measures probably hurt him, economically and politically.

(b) The most outstanding characteristic of our other chief offensive weapon,

covert measures, is that its potential for bringing about a basic change in

Cuba is still largely unknown. The program, which makes use of Cuban exiles

and which is not yet fully underway, has already achieved a degree of success

-- e. g. in demonstrating to Cubans that Castro is not invulnerable, in forcing

Castro to divert valuable resources for defense against covert activities and,

-perhaps, in stimulating the insurgency which is evident within Cuba. As yet,

## Page 27

TOP SECRET

- 3-

our covert program has not been directed in such a way as to inflict serious

economic damage on Cuba. There are those who believe that much can be

done in this regard.

4. In theory at least, our present offensive measures, vigorously pursued,

will lead finally to one of the following three results, each of which constitutes

a removal of the Soviet satellite from the Hemisphere.

(a) An overthrow of the Castro regime. (Dissident elements, most prob-

ably from the military and the bureaucracy, seize power with a direct or in-

direct assist from the U.S.; the people of Cuba, tired of economic hardship,

lack of freedom, and isolation from their Latin American brethren, embrace

the new group.) Most Cuban experts in the U.S. Government regard this as

the most likely of the three eventualities.

(b) Accommodation with Castro on U.S. terms (Cuba breaks its tie-line

with the USSR, ends its subversion efforts, and perhaps, renounces its Com-

munist ideology). While highly unlikely, it is not inconceivable that, such

factors as (1) U.S. isolation and covert measures, (2) further economic

deterioration in spite of Soviet aid, and (3) distrust of Soviet intentions, will

lead Castro to believe that he has no choice but accommodation. Indeed, there

is evidence that Castro may already be thinking along these lines. In the past

several months, he has made a number of accommodation noises, and since

he undoubtedly has a pretty good reading of our minimum terms, these noises

could conceivably indicate that he is willing to go a long way towards meeting

them. Che Guevera's reported nervousness at Castro's accommodation tend-

encies substantiate the view that Castro's desire to negotiate is genuine and

not merely a ploy to reduce U.S. heat on Cuba.

But there are obvious major problems with this alternative. Not the least of

these is whether the American people would tolerate accommodation with even

a reformed Castro, especially in view of Lee Oswald's pro-Castro connection.

Also, it is not now possible to gauge accurately the impact of President

Kennedy's death on Castro's apparent accommodation tendencies. Nevertheless,.

accommodation remains a distinct possibility, if not for now, then for later.

(c) A Soviet decision to quit Cuba. This may be the most unlikely of the

three eventualities. Yet such a Soviet decision cannot be dismissed categorically

in view of such factors as (l) the lack of real Soviet progress in making Cuba a

"show piece", (2) the obvious U.S. determination to make Cuba a Soviet "dead

end"' in the Hemisphere (no more Cuba's will be permitted), (3) the magnitude of

TOP SECRET

DocId: 32423484 Page 27

---

## Page 28

TOP SECRET

-4-

Soviet aid to Cuba, and (4) the extent of the USSR's own present economic

problems. At the least, these factors would appear to have a bearing on

how the Russians would view their eviction from Cuba either by an overthrow

of the Castro regime or by a Castro decision toaccommodate with the U.S. on

U.S. terms. Relief would probably mix generously with Russian grief, espec-

ially if the Russians could find a vaguely credible fig-leaf.

5. The $64 question -- Will our present offensive measures, even if imple-

mented rigorously and flawlessly, ever lead, by one way or another, to the

removal of the Soviet satellite from the Hemisphere? -- is impossible to answer.

Most people probably tend to be skeptical but there are also a number of optim-

ists; many of whom are among the closest observers of the Cuban situation.

Probably the most we can say for certain is that we appear to be moving in the

right direction; and this, of course, is important. A vigorous, tough, and

nasty policy probably lays the best groundwork for bringing about any of the

three eventualities which are noted above and which would each constitute a

removal of the Soviet satellite from the Hemisphere. From a domestic political

viewpoint this is probably fortuitous; a tough, but no-invasion policy is one policy

which the American people appear prepared to support at this time.

6. In closing, here are a few gratuitous and unorganized observations which

bear on the problem of U.S. action in the future. First, while always alert to

the danger of escalation in US/USSR relations, we should continue to explore

every avenue in order to make life as difficult for Castro and as expensive and

unpleasant for the USSR as possible.

Special attention should always be directed

toward finding new ways to (1) tighten existing isolation measures, (2) conduct

other forms of economic warfare against Castro, (3) strengthen our covert action

program, (4) deepen the now-visible rift between Castro and the USSR, and (5)

gain solid Latin American interest and support for further actions against Cuba.

Second, we should continue to press hard in our anti-subversion campaign, not

only for its salutary effect in Latin America but also for the effect it could have

on Castro. Recognition by Castro that there is no chance for a win in Latin

America could go a long way in convincing him that he must meet U.S. minimum

terms.

Third, we should stay flexible.

We should be prepared to meet any event

which might offer the opportunity of a sudden overthrow of Castro (e. g. the

shooting down of a U-2). Also, we should never close the door completely to

possible accommodation with Castro on U.S. terms; in this regard, Administration

officials should avoid making the point publicly that we are after Castro's head

per se.

Fourth, we should ever be cautious about our public posture on any

issue relating to Cuba. Generally speaking, we should try to keep Cuba in per-

spective and in a low-key. The Administration should try to convey the sense

= 5-

(L) that it fully recognizes and understands the substance and extent of the

threat which Cuba presents to the U.S. and the Hemisphere, and (2) that it

is working hard, steadily, efficiently, confidently, successfully, and with-

out fanfare, in controlling the threat. Conveyance of a sense of high danger,

normally, should be studiously avoided.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Cuba Meeting (Without President) Next Tuesday, December 10, 1963

1. I spoke to. John Crimmins at some length about preparations for the meeting

next week regarding new courses of action we can take, short of invasion, to

make life difficult for Castro. He plans to produce the following type of docu-

ment for the meeting.

(a) The paper will include State's recommendation on how we plan to

proceed in the OAS as a result of the Cuban arms cache issue. For

example, should we pugh for a break in diplomatic relations among

the "soft 5", a break in economic relations between Latin America

and Cuba, a break in communications between the OAS countries and

Cuba?

(b) The paper will then describe a number of possible bilateral and

unilateral actions which we can take (e.g. unleashing of the exiles,

low level flights, military feints (at a level which will make the

Cubans, but not the Soviets, jumpy), intensification of covert program).

There will be a brief discussion giving the advantages and disadvantages

of each of these courses of action, along with State's recommendation

in favor or against.

(c) John will get the paper distributed by Saturday afternoon so that

the agencies will have time to consider State's recommendations

before the Tuesday meeting:

2. John plans to meet with Alexis Johnson and the Secretary this evening.

Among other things he hopes to clear the above menu.

3.

Bromley feels that we should try to maintain this meeting as a Standing

Group meeting (among other things, this will allow us to invite the AG).

Attendence at the meeting would be roughly as follows: Ed Martin, somebody

from the 7th floor of State, John McCone, Dez Fitzgerald or Dick Helms,

Roswell Gilpatric, another person from Defense, Don Wilson, and the AG.

Do you have any problems with such a list? How about Douglas Dillon, Maxwell

Taylor, Ted Sorensen?

how you can get to Europe in that same time. Nevertheless this is not.

a cause for alarm or dispair.

2. Relations with the Soviet Union

Your fIst dipiamarie purpose mas to assure Milkoyan and

Kbrughcher of your denise to sustain lines of communication opened under

President Kennedy and your determination that the US will meet anyone

hall way for peace. You do sos expect a summit meeting but you do expect

to continuo discussion in search of possible agreements.. You will sot

wish to comment on specific lanues, and is particular you will want to be

careful about questions suggesting that the British are more optimiatic

than we are. The fact is that they are, but that me do not mant to maico

tinuiag problems of our foreiga polley.

While that revier in under way

and until you have a chance to consider its results, you have nothing more

5. Alliance for Progress

There is no higher priority on your agenda and you are sorking

closely with Secretary Rusk to lind ways and means of increasing the

effectiveness of the Goverament's work on this whole subject.

6. On the Kennedy Round

Yon had a goid talk with Governor Herter this afterzoon; you

have cozlidence in him; the focus of discussion is now in Europe among

the members of the Six, on the agricultural issue, and this is not the time

for you to do more than to say that you have strongly supported the objec-.

tives of tbe Irade Expansion Act right from the beginning and that you

mean to carry on toward the basic objectives set by President Kennedy

iwo years ago.

T. Majaysia

There is a real prospect of new adventures by Sukarzo here, and you

will probably not want to say more than that the situation is ane which you are

watching vory closely and on which we are in very close consultation, not

only with the countries immediately concerned but with the United Kingdos

and Australia.

8. Cambodia

I think you will want to be very reserved. Sihanouk 22g bees

making outrageous statements, but the fact is the prodiem ia pathological

and aot diplomazic, and it would be dangerous to comment even off-tbe

Wheat Deal

¿on are in favor of ii, but the question is still one at prico

bargaining between the Russians and the traders, and your position is what

President Kennody's was: les the negotiators negotiate.

10. Yesen and the Middle East

I think you may wish to dodge the questions by saying this is another

of the satters you are having siudied and will be reviewing in the next two

days, and you would prefer not lo comment tonight.

You are well briefed on this, and made your own position clear

MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT - December 19, 1963 - 10:55 A.M.

SUBJECT: Cuba

Others Present: Acting Secretary Ball; Ambassador Thompson; Deputy

Under Secretary Johnson; Assistant Secretary Martin;

John Crimmins; Acting Secretary Gilpatric; Secretary

Vance; General Wheeler; Secretary Dillon; Acting

Director General Carter; Richard Helms; Desmond

Fitzgerald; Deputy Director Wilson; McGeorge Bundy;

William Moyers; George Reedy; Gordon Chase.

The primary purpose of the meeting was to brief the President in depth about

some of the basic Cuban issues.

Essentially, the discussion described where

we have been since January, 1963, where we are now, and where we can go.

(An outline which was prepared for the discussion is attached.)

1. A large part of the meeting was devoted to a briefing by Mr. Fitzgerald

and a general discussion on CIA's present covert program and on the U.S.

Government's economic denial program. Essentially, this part of the dis-

cussion covered 6 areas.

(a) Mr. Fitzgerald described covert intelligence activities directed

against Castro's regime, including the numbers, characteristics, and geo-

graphic spread of CIA assets within Cuba.

(b) Mi. Fitzgerald described ClA-controlled radio programs and other

propaganda media directed at Cuba which have been used to encourage low

risk, simple sabotage and other forms of active and passive resistance, and

to stimulate tension within the regime and between Cuba and the Soviet Bloc.

He noted the recent increase of spontaneous anti-regime propaganda inside Cuba.

to deny to Cuba commodities from the Frèe World which are critical to the

economy. The results have been mixed. For example, while we have been able

to penetrate certain European firms which deal with Cuba, we also know that

equipment vitally needed in Cuba, some of U.S. origin, reaches the island via

Canada and Great Britain.

The group agreed that this is not an easy problem; Mr. Ball said that our

allies have always been reluctant to interfere with private traders and have

always had a different view of Free World/Bloc trade than we have had.

Nevertheless, it was also agreed that we should intensify our efforts and that

there are still things we can do. First, Mr. Crimmins noted that we could

consider ways in which the new amendment to the Foreign Assistance Author-

ization Act (prevents assistance to any country whose planes or ships carry

commodities to Cuba) can be used to reinforce our economic denial program.

Second, Mr. Ball said that the question of Canadian trade in sensitive items

would be taken up with the Canadian Minister of Economics and Trade on

December 20; later, My. Ball will talk to other appropriate Free World gov-

ernments also. Third, the President directed that the agencies prepare a

detailed memorandum (including the names of companies and commodities in-

volved in Free World trade with Cuba) which, inter alia, will be useful for his

forthcoming talks with Prime Ministers Home and Pearson.

(d) Mr. Fitzgerald spoke about CIA's program to identify, seek out, and

establish contact with potentially dissident non-Communist elements in the

power centers of the regime with a view to stimulating an internal coup which

would dislodge Castro. Our effort is based on the premise that a popular up-

rising in Cuba is unlikely, primarily because Castro is capable of controlling

such

an uprising. Instead, we are trying to penetrate the Cuban regime's

power structure. In this regard, we have had only limited success. On the

one hand, we have been able to make an important penetration in the Cuban

army. On the other hand, the dissident elements, while willing to act, are not

yet willing to act together. They simply don't trust each other, mainly because

Castro has been successful, in the past, in penetrating dissident groups.

The President asked whether there is any significant insurgency within Cuba.

Mr. Fitzgerald said there is some but that there is no national movement on :

which we can build. Mr. Bundy noted that the insurgents generally seem to suf-

fer heavy losses at Castro's hands..

(e) Mr. Fitzgerald said that CIA has directed four small scale, externally

mounted sabotage operations for the purpose of stimulating resistance and

hurting Cuba economically. The discussion then focussed on a proposed attack

on a major target. -- the Matanzas power plant. Mr. Fitzgerald noted that this

would have a significant favorable impact, psychologically as well as econom-

ically; the dissidents would view the attack as evidence that the Johnson Admin-

istration is not giving up the fight for Cuba.

But there are a number of disadvantages to the power plant attack. First, the

chances of total success (e.g. target destroyed, no one caught) are less than

50-50 while the chances of partial success (target destroyed, people caught) are

only somewhat better than 50-50. Second, if the raiders get caught, they will

undoubtedly admit their CIA connection. (General Carter believed this point

was weak -- we get blamed for everything that happens in Cuba anyway.) Third,

such an attack will be highly visible and will have a high noise-level.

-gay visible and wi

In this

regard, Mr. Bundy said that we might want to lie low for now so that Castro,

presently under a strain because of the arms cache discovery, will not be able

to shift the accusing finger in our direction.

slow up the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Cuba. Fifth, Ambassador Thompson

said that the timing seemed bad -- the Soviets now appeared to be in a situation

where they may be thinking of cutting back aid to Cuba. They will draw a lot

of conclusions from the first acts of President Johnson. An attack on a big

Cuban target could give Castro important leverage in his negotiations for more

Soviet aid.

General Wheeler thought that, to improve the chance of success, we might want

to try to hit the Matanzas power plant from the air; it should be noted that there

have already been some free-lance raids over Cuba. Alexis Johnson pointed out

that an air strike might cause retaliation against one of our U-2 flights.

In response to a question, Secretary Vance indicated that he was in favor of an

attack on Matanzas.

It was decided that there will be no air or ground attack on the Matanzas power

plant at this time, primarily because of its high probability of failure and be-

cause of the Soviet dimension. However, it was agreed, in principle, that low-

risk sabotage efforts could go forward along with the planning necessary to

develop an air strike capability.

(f) Mr. Fitzgerald described CIA's program in aiding two autonomous

Cuban exile groups, which will be operating from outside the U.S. One group,

which is headed by Manuel Artime, will start operating out of Costa Rica and

Nicaragua in February; the other group is headed by Manolo Ray who is some-

what to the left of Artime, but probably has the best following within Cuba. Both

of these groups will conduct externally mounted raids on Cuba, and will send

teams inside Cuba to conduct internal sabotage and to establish contact with dis-

sidents. Mr. Fitzgerald added that there are some disadvantages in these oper-

ations -- the groups aren't trained by CIA and they operate outside of CLA control.

But there are advantages too -- they operate from outside United States territory

and we will have relatively little trouble denying U.S. association with these groups.

Mr. Bundy noted, and Mr. Fitzgerald agreed, that these groups operate a

long distance away from the target; we cannot expect too much effect from

their raids.

2. Mr. Bundy gave a very quick briefing on some other aspects of the current

Cuban situation. (The group paused to read the attached CIA situation brief. )

(a) With respect to Soviet/ Cuban military strength on the island, Mr.

Bundy noted that one of our primary objectives. is to ensure that there is no

reintroduction of offensive missiles. The camera is our best inspector and, so

far as we know, there are no offensive missiles now in Cuba. Mr. Bundy added

that we are concerned about the transfer of SAM control to the Cubans in about

mid-1964, and we will have to watch this development carefully. As for the

Soviet troops, the general consensus of the group was that the big withdrawals

are over and that, from here on, the withdrawals will proceed more slowly.

(b) Mr. Bundy noted, in passing, our anti-subversion efforts. The key to

the problem is to build up the will and capabilities of the Latin American

countries to counter the threat. Our efforts in the field of controlling travel

between Latin America and Cuba are also important.

(c)

Mr. Bundy described briefly the very tenuous, sensitive, and marginal

contacts we have established with Castro himself. The initiative is on Castro's

part and we are essentially faced with a decision as to whether or not we are

prepared to listen to what Castro has to say. Mr. Ball noted that such U.S. /

Cuban contacts could have an unsettling effect on Soviet/Cuban relations.

3. MI. Bundy described several unilateral and bilateral courses of action we

can take in the future to make life difficult for Castro.

(a) Air attacks, unleashing of exiles (allowing them to use U.S. territory

as a base for attacks on Cuba), and low level flights are aggressive-type acts

which have distinct advantages but which are similar in that they all tend to

raise the noise-level. Low level flights, for example, would provide us with

more intelligence and would irritate and harass Castro.. At the same time, they

could precipitate the shooting down of a U-2.

(b) Mr. Bundy said that we can take further unilateral shipping measures

-- e.g. close ports and deny U.S. -financed commodities to lines engaged in

Free World shipping to Cuba. He noted, however, that we have found through

past experience that bilateral measures are more effective in reducing Free

World shipping to Cuba. At the same time, we should not deceive ourselves.

DocId:32423484

- 5-

We should recognize that the Soviets are capable of handling all Cuba's

shipping needs even if we are able to eliminate Free World shipping to Cuba.

(c) MT. Bundy said that the President could make a public statement in

the near future, taking a more vigorous line than we have in the past.

that in his November 18 speech, President Kennedy made two points about Cuba

-- the first was designed to encourage anti-Castro elements within Cuba to

revolt, and the second was to indicate that we would not permit another Cuba in

the Hemisphere.

(d) Bilaterally there are possibilities of increasing our pressures against

Free World trade to Cuba. Spain should be a high priority target.

NOTE: At this point the President left the room and there was a brief discussion

about the exiles in Florida. Mr. Crimmins said that resettlement remains our

basic policy. It is true that the exiles feel that the pressure for their resettle-

ment is intense. In fact, it is no more intense now than it has been for some time.

5. On the President's return to the room, Mr. Bundy introduced the subject of

the discovery in Venezuela of the Cuban arms cache.

(2) Mr. Helms gave a graphic presentation of the link between the arms

cache and a plot to upset the elections in Caracas.

(D) Mr. Martin explained the status of the OAS investigation of the arms

cache.

The evidence is convincing in showing that the arms were from Cuba.

The OAS investigating team is still working on its report. Hopefully, it will be

able to tie the arms cache into a general plot to subvert Venezuela. The report

should be ready by about January 10.

(c) Mr. Bundy described the types of action we can hope to get in the OAS

as a result of the discovery of the arms cache. The most interesting is the

surveillance action where we have essentially two basic choices - we may want

to push for a system which involves search and seizure of Cuban vessels on the

high seas; this implies the possible use of force. Or we can push for a system

involving the search and seizure of Cuban vessels in territorial waters; this

evades the'issue of force.. Mr. Bundy added that it is still too early to know

how far the Latin Americans will go in support of force against Castro. We.

have put out feelers.

6. Mr. Bundy brought up the problem of lifting travel restrictions on Americans

who wish to go to Cuba. Mr. Ball noted that a great number of students want to

go down to Cuba during the Christmas holidays and that Justice Department

recommends that we lift our travel restrictions. If we don't, we will probably

be obliged to put many of the students in jail when they return; this will be

embarrassing. Mr. Ball added that the State Department is tentatively opposed

to lifting the travel restrictions because of the effect it will have on Latin

American countries. We have been trying to get the Latin Americans to impose

restrictions on travel to Cuba; if we lift our own restrictions, our position will

be considerably weakened. Mr. Ball said that he would be meeting with the

Attorney General later in the day to talk about the subject.

Tentatively, the President indicated that he favored maintaining the travel

restrictions and a policy of selective prosecution.

MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT: Sabotage against Castro

Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the

Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine con-

tinuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish

to review.. The three operations involved are:

(1) a commando sabotage operation against a coastal

warehouse and pier;

(2) a sabotage attack against naval or patrol vessels in

a harbor;

and

(3) a sabotage operation against a fuel barge proceeding

in coastal waters.

All of these operations would have been approved three months ago,

and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted

because of high seas.

While it is always hard to predict the noise

level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the

small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which occurred in late December

which Castro promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation

approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it.

seemed to fall within the guidance you expressed in your first review

of the Cuban problem).

The policy question now is this: If we continue these even small

sabotage operations, Castro will certainly know it. Equally, if we

call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians.

We thus

have an opportunity to choose.

I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone.

I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle

of covert sabotage against Cuba. I know that Rusk has never liked it

and that McNamara thinks it does very little good.

McCone and the CIA

are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the

Castro problem.

I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced,

but before hearing full argument, my guess is that in your position

ineffective, and damaging to our broader policy. I might then wish

to make a little capital from this decision with the Soviet Union.

III. Primary and Secondary Objectives

A. Primary

Our aim in this operation would be to end the potential

of the Castro regime, and of the USSR or Communist China through

the Castro regime, to extend Communist influence and power in

this hemisphere. Immediately, however, a very basic problem

arises: How can we hope to attain this object short of getting

rid of the Castro regime itself? It is entirely possible that

Castro might decide

at any given moment to foreswear in solemn

terms any intention of interfering in any way in the internal

affairs of other Latin American countries.

As a matter of

fact, he denies currently any such activity on his part.

Conceivably, if US pressures proved effective he might go

further

- 6 -

further and abandon identifiable activities such as the -

training of nationals of other countries, the dissemination

of insurrection propaganda, and insurrection inciting broad-

casts. But could we have any assurance that once he had

formally complied with our wishes and we had eased the

pressures mounted against him, he would not quickly resume

his previous course? Or that the end result of our efforts

would not merely be a more effective concealment of continued

Cuban manipulations?

The problem is not alone that Comunists in a situation

like this literally and as a matter of principle on their part

cannot be trusted. There is the added difficulty of the

peculiar character of Castro and certain of his closest

associates. • Evidently revolution is their raison d'etre as

political

political beings. We have every reason to believe that they

no more could give up their revolutionary agitations and

activities than they could stop breathing. We might hope that

the Soviet leaders, with their greater sense of responsibility

in a nuclear age, could be made to see the dangers and seek to

restrain Castro. But could we expect the Soviet leaders to

be effective? Such evidence as we have suggests that Castro

is quite capable of defying the wishes of Moscow:

(Witness the

test-ban fiasco.

Also consider Moscow's helplessness as

against the Albanians,

the North Koreans, and the North

Vietnamese.) If the Soviets applied strong sanctions, it might

be another matter. But even this is uncertain. And, obviously,

the fact of Communist China adds further complications. On the

one hand, the certainty of Peiping's seizure upon any Soviet

cautionary move to

score points in its cold war with Moscow

would have an

inhibiting effect on the Soviets. On the other, should the

Russians choose to ignore Chinese scorn and threaten to wipe

their hands clean of their dangerous tool, Communist China would

offer Castro an alternative, at least ideologically, and one.

to which he might well turn.

Perhaps of even greater moment is that the primary danger

we face in Castro is not what he does in the way of distributing

arms, disseminating propaganda, training subversives, and

dispatching agents, but in the impact the very existence of his

regime has upon the leftist movement in many Latin American

countries. Presume, for example, that Castro did abandon all his

efforts to export revolution, would this lead to an improvement

of the situation in Venezuela? The simple fact is that Castro

represents

DocId: 32423484 Page 49

## Page 50

represents a successful defiance of the US, a negation of our

whole hemispheric policy of almost a century and a half. Until

Castro did it, no Latin American could be sure of getting away

with a connunist-type revolution and a tie-in with the Soviet

Union. As long as Castro endures, Communists in other Latin

American countries can, to use Stalin's words, "struggle with

good heart." Also, might not a massive US effort to achieve

the limited objective

of ending Castro's interference in

other countries actually increase rather than diminish his power

indirectly to stimulate revolutionary movements?

Would it not

suggest that except for this one thing, communist rule in Cuba,

together with the military and political ties with the Soviets,

was tolerable to us? Suppose again that Castro bowed to our demands

in this matter. Would we not then be at a point where continued

DocId: 32423484

continued hostility toward the regime was incongruous? Would

we not have moved a decisive step toward granting Castro full

respectability?

If we are to be realistic about our intent to get rid of

the cancerous potential of Castroism, is an attack on the

symptons enough?

Is it not essential to get at the disease itself?

B. Secondary.

While our major interest in the proposed operation

would

be to eliminate the dangers inherent in Castroism, an

added consideration would be to demonstrate to the Soviet Union

that not only is no money to be made from efforts to infiltrate

this hemisphere, but that mounting cost and grave risks

necessarily and inevitably will follow any such efforts. Quite

evidently the Soviet leaders are concerned for many different

reasons with the incompatability between their active pursult

of world revolutionary goals and Soviet national interests.

The occasion of this generalization is amply demonstrated by history

and

/nature of the conflict that has developed between the USSR

and Communist China. Our best hope for a favorable resolution

of the cold war is for this concern to grow to a point where

Moscow will decide once and for all that world revolution is

a luxury that it simply cannot afford. Perhaps the one thing

that stands in the way of such a happy decision is the prospect,

represented first by the success of Castro in Cuba and second

by the increasingly unstable situation in other Latin American

countries, that big gains can be made in this hemisphere and at

relatively little cost. If we can pull off a successful

campaign against Cuba, this prospect would be all but obliterated.

The gain we would have made could, then, extend far beyond that

of simply increasing the immediate security of this hemisphere.

It could extend to the point of decisive forward movement toward

liquidation of our cold war with the Soviets. (It might also

cold

have implications for our second/war, that with Connunist China.)

IV. Key Issues

The Demand

"The first of a number of basic questions that will

confront us

has to do with the

nature of the demand we would postulate for castro.

In the case

of the missile crisis of October, 1962, a factor that made for

success was that our demand could be clearly and simply stated

and could be satisfied by a concrete action on the part of our

adversaries

from Cuba. We could in this instance be equally straight

forward if we wanted to be. We could make it a matter of

Mit: + +44 -44490;50

Castro's ceasing"his efforts to export revolution. But where

would this leave us? As noted above, a Castro commitment to

conform to this demand, even if made with sincerity which

would be highly unlikely, would not take care of our problem.

And short of a sincere commitment, we could find ourselves with

a whole can of worms on our hands.

Castro could offer to trade

a commitment, which he could well have no intention of abiding

by, for a change in our policy of hostility; he could stop

for a period all of the objectional activities and leave us out

on a limb; he could more effectively go underground and perhaps

actually increase his potential.

- 14, -

We might, on the other hand, make clear that nothing

less than the demise of the Castro regime would satisfy us.

But could we afford to be so candid? Having endured the regime

for seven years, and having taken a very great deal from it,

how could we justify suddealy

moving for its extinction? And

if we were publicly to acknowledge this as our aim, would not a

sudden blow seem a more logical way of proceeding than the

application of measured pressures? Also, the statement of this

as our objective would maximize the chances, which although

probably slight still must be taken into account, of Soviet

military support of Cuba. It would, in other words, throw down

the gauntlet for the Soviets and without the face saving escape

hatches that would be available if our objective was stated in less

sweeping terms.

Probably the most judicious course would be to justify

our action on grounds of defense of the security of other

American states without any clarification of when and under

what circumstances we would consider the security threat at an

end. Once the mounting of pressures was underway, we could

gradually make clear that only a basic change in the regime

of its policies would meet the needs of the situation.

The Occasion

2. A second key question is how do we justify

inauguration of the measures.

Would it not be essential to have

a dramatic incident or action on which to peg our move. Given

the context, in which we would operate, that is the threat to

the security of other Latin American countries, would we not

require convincing and if

possible, alarming evidence that

the threat was real and immediate? With the possible exception

may be we can make the arms cache an adequate peg. If so,

however, it will be necessary to have an AS finding in regard

to the cache that willmake it a plausible causus for action.

Can we arrange such a reaction when the

matter is considered

in March? Would it not be of the utmost importance that in

Venezuela then at least from certain of the other Caribbean

countries?

should the arms cache prove a dud, which well way be the

case, should we not wait until we have a satisfactory peg.

Giyen

Castro's proclivity for irresponsibility, we can sit back and

wait with reasonable assurance for one to be thrown into our lap.

But would not a better bet be to provoke one?

The important thing about the occasioning incident is

that the nore serious it is, and the more the Latin American

countries themselves - in whole of in part -- get out in

front and scream about it, the less complex will be our

problem with regard to Latin American support and world

opinion generally. Should, for example, We rely upon past

actions, including the arns cache, we would necessarily face

a good deal of scepticism and apathy. The world has simply

gotten too used to these, and has, among other things, dis-

counted the actual dangers involved. Under even the most

favorable of circumstances (e.g., a strong OAS resolution re the

arms cache), US movement on the basis of warmed up complaints

of the past will have a ring of phoniness:

Our legal position would have to rest in the first

instance on the provisions of the UN Charter recognizing the

right of nations to self defense and the right of regional

raw: co0o: 387-78-0-54

groupings of states to establish and maintain collective

security arrangements. With these Charter provisions as a

base, the direct legal case could be built upon subparagraph

3 of Resolution II of the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of

Ministers of Foreign Affairs at Punta del Este in January 1962.

This Resolution, with underscoring added, reads as follows:

"3.

To urge the member states to take those steps

that they may consider appropriate for their

individual of collective self-defense, and to

cooperate, as may be necessary or desirable;

to strengthen their capacity to counteract

threats or acts of aggression, subversion, or

other dangers to peace and security resulting

from the continued intervention in this

hemisphere of Sino-soviet powers in accordance

with the obligations established in treaties

and agreements such as the Charter of the

Organization of American States and the Inter-

American Treaty

of Reciprocal Assistance."

The

- 17c -

The wording of this paragraph is sufficiently broad

to cover any steps the US should take, even if it moved

entirely on its own. However, the force of the Resolution

would be greatly increased if the AS should specifically

sanction action under the Resolution, even if only after

action had begun. Moreover, the case would obviously be far

more defensible if at least several Latin American states

joined actively in the action program.

The fact that we have this legal cover for moving

against Castro would not still, or even affect, criticism

from the Communist side, of from many neutralists. The

simple fact is that even if we had an air tight legal case,

it would not be accepted in many quarters of the globe.

Perhaps, therefore, we should not base our action simply

upon international understandings and agreements.

In the

final analysis, our case will be strongest, and will be most

respected, if we make full use of the inherent Fight of any

state to self-defense, as we did in the missile crisis of

1962. In this connection, we have and should bring into

immediate play the succinctly worded doctrine enunciated by

President Kennedy at his press conference on September 13, 1962.

This Kennedy Doctrine, which was categorically reaffirmed

on occasion of the settlement of the Missile Crisis and as

a caveat limiting the no-invasion "comnitment" but which seems

to have slipped into the background since, reads as follows:

"But let me make this clear once again. If at

any time the Communist build-up in Cuba were to

endanger of interfere with our security in any way,

including our base at Guantanamo, our passage to the

Panama Canal, our missile and space activities in

Cape Canaveral or the lives of the American people

to expand its aggressive purposes by force or the

threat of force against any nation in the heris-

phere or become an offensive military base of

significant capacity for the Soviet Union, then

this country will do whatever must be done to

protect its own security and that of its allies."

D. Hemispheric Coordination. Perhaps the most

consequential problem the US will face will be to get maximum

solidarity anong the American states for its action. This, as

was noted above, would be greatly facilitated if a serious new

manifestation of the Cuban threat is available.

Even in this

circumstance, however, great difficulties will be encountered

in securing the support of several key Latin American countries:

Under other circumstances, i.e., action on the basis of warmed

over charges, this support will more than likely be lacking.

The fundamental question before us is, therefore, how

far we are willing to go without full hemispheric support, or

even in the face of important hemispheric opposition. If we

are not willing to assume a certain anount of stigma with

regard to a revival of "Yankee Imperialisn" a la the past,

which incidentally will certainly grow as our operations are

drawn out, of even to risk at least a temporary and probably

trying division within the family of American states, the

judicious thing would probably be to refrain from action unless

and until the Cubans give us a sufficiently dangerous justification

as to shock and alarm all.

should we decide thät we have no choice but to risk

friction with our southern allies, it will still be important

that we secure the active cooperation of as many of them as

How can we best do this? One possibility would be to move

for a decision for action (either as against the arms cache

make up of the Castro regime were effacted. Should we from

the opening salvo of the operation signal our overall

intention as we did in the Missile Crisis? Or should we let

our purposes unfold and develop as incidents and counter-

incidents in the campaign took place? Logically, the nature

of the causative incident should play a large part in this

determination. Should Castro be nailed with an activity of

obviously great gravity, our best tactic would seem to be to

set forth our aims and intentions in maximal terms. But if

we have to move on the basis of a minor of questionable

provocation, would it not be best to tailor one immediate

response to that order of magnitude and leave it to subsequent

Castro actions and defiancies to justify stepping 'up the pace?

plan, and perhaps even make known, what sort of actions on

the part of the Cubans would be cause of further actions on

part?

Here, however, an important question arises.

No matter

how we begin, whether on low or high key, do we nothave to

decide from the first how far we are willins ultimately to go?

One thing that would seem axiomatic is that we cannot afford

another "Bay of Pigs" in one form or other. If we embark on a

program designed to achieve certain ends and the first measures,

whether relatively strong of mild, do not achieve those ends,

could we afford to back down and simply accept the status quo

ante, which might in practice leave Castro stronger and more

defiant than ever? But what if the difficulties proved greater

than foreseen and we found ourselves being forced nearer and

nearer to open warfare of even invasion, would our national

interest

interest be served thereby? Or suppose Soviet reaction were

more violent than anticipated, would we be prepared seriously

to risk a major nuclear war? And what if we found our Latin

American allies pulling completely away from us? would we be

willing to go it alone?

We have to allow the possibility that

the end of theroad will be more hazardous than the beginning.

This being so, should we get on the road in the first place

unless we are willing to see the hazards through to the end,

whatever they may be? Once our power and prestige are

committed, can we, without unacceptable damage to our

hemispheric and world position, yield our ground? Thus the

basic issue becomes not what we will or will not do at the

first or second stage, but what we will or will not do during

the course of the whole campaign.

•If we

If we decide that there are limits beyond which we wilt

not go, What escape routes can we provide for ourselves?

Would we be prepared to enter into a negotiated

settlement

whereby we would lift pressures in exchange for a verbal

commitment from Castro? What if we proved unable to get

even a verbal commitment? Would a feasible out be simply to

drop the pressures and unilaterally declare that if such and

such took place in the future, we would act with all force?

Might we have as an "alternate objective" a bargain with the

USSR whereby we would lay off Castro if it abandoned its ties

and support?

F. Orchestration.

In the actual application of measures,

we will necessarily be subject to two conflicting considerations.

On the one hand, we will need to get the job done as expeditiously

as possible in order to mininize the chances of adverse re-

actions, untoward incidents, etc. On the other, we will need

to hold damage to. Cuba and the Cuban people to an absolute

minimum.

Which of these should most affect our conduct?

by a campaign to keep down the hard currency price of sugar.

But could we expect these to produce any more decisive results:

than other economic pressures in the past? We no doubt can

effect a substantial step up of clandestine and subversive

activities, but probably not to a point seriously to bother

the regime unless accompanied by important support from the

outside, which only we could furnish.

while actually bearing down heavily? Would it not be possible

for example, to deploy larger scale naval forces inthe vicinity

needed and desired? Our ain in this case would not be a

single, all encompassing blow, but a succession of little but

growing successes.

As we subjected the regime to the

weight of massive, but

generally unused, military forces and to a US managed and

supported internal war of liberation, we could expect (1) the

world to become accustomed; as in the case of the Communists

in so many instances, and (2) to precipitate particular incidents

of growing seriousness against which we could react with a

step up in the harshness of our measures. Thus, in time, we

could get ourselves in a position where we would be pulling

virtually all stops, but without a corresponding shock to world

opinion or a single take it or leave it challenge to the USSR:

G. Costs and Risks of Action. There can be little

question that a high pressure operation against Cuba will be

a costly and perhaps risky affair. AT one end of the spectrum is

the possibility of military involvement with the Uss?,. We

can, perhaps, heavily discount this possibility, but we cannot

ignore it.

The Soviet leaders are on record that they will

support Cuba against any military attack.. In a case of an

out and out US invasion, they would be hard pressed to ignore

their assurances without a severe loss of face. In case of a

gradual build up of US hostility, they would find an escape

much easier and would very probably take full advantage of

But we can never be completely sure.. Here, then, is a

chance we would simply have to take. Are the stakes sufficiently

high to take it?

The Uss will certainly take a licking in "international

they would keep their approval to themselves. Voiced opinion

truth, we will appear in a nasty light, and one which the fires from

Whether lasting damage will have been been done to our

relationship with the hatin American countries can only be

surmised. Certainly we can not escape without an increase in

One immediate cost that will need to be weighed is

the interruption of the detente trend with respect to the

side of the coin are the fact that failure to bring Castro

ourselves and our friends in Latin America; (2) raise a real

possibility our having either to tolerate the establishment of a

Communist regime in one or more of the other Latin American

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Cuba - Covert Program

1. Peter Jessup and I talked about the Special Group meeting

last week, and the intention to get higher authority's decisions this

week on a number of specific matters.

2. Attached is a collection of background documents which bear

on the problem.

Tab 1 - A letter, dated March 6, from Des Fitzgerald to you

describing a number of decisions which need to be taken.

Tab 2 - A memorandum, dated March 30, to the Special

Group giving a status report on autonomous Cuban exile groups.

Tab 3 - A memorandum, dated about January 25, which re-

views and evaluates the current covert program. Among other

things, it attempts to show how the covert program ties in with our

other programs directed against Cuba.

Tab 4 - A CIA memorandum, dated February 21, describing

our possible courses of action (a) if we decide we can live with

Castro, and (b) if we cannot live with Castro.

Tab 5 - A memorandum, dated March 17, which describes

the morale among anti-Castro Cubans.

3. In essence, the issues in the covert program seem to boil

down to the following:

(a) CI A now collects intelligence from within Cuba. It is

axiomatic that this will go on, and, thus, no decision from higher

authority is needed.

(b) CIA-controlled radio programs and other propaganda

media are now directed at Cuba to encourage low risk, simple

sabotage and other forms of active and passive resistance, and to

stimulate tension within the regime and between Cuba and the Soviet

Bloc.

(c) CIA is now working with State in its economic denial

(d) CIA is now trying to identify, seek out, and establish

(e) CIA is now supporting two autonomous Cuban exile groups.

These will be operating in the very near future. While withdrawal of

our support will not prevent these groups from raiding Cuba in the

short run, it will probably dry up this capability over the long run.

Higher authority may want to (1) withdraw support immediately

and try, if possible, to prevent any raids, (2) withdraw support if

and when the exile activities

seem to be leading to an intolerable

situation, or (3) continue support to the exile groups indefinitely.

(f) CIA now supports and directs a sabotage raiding apparatus

in Florida; this apparatus is now standing by, waiting for something

to do.

Higher authority may want to (1) disband the apparatus, (2) per-

mit the apparatus to go ahead with its sabotage program.

(g) CIA now has the capacity to sabotage Cuban merchant

ships calling at foreign ports.

Higher authority may want to (1) disband the program, (2) try to

keep this capacity on the shelf for a while longer, or (3) permit the

sabotage of Cuban ships.

The Honorable McGeorge Bundy

Special Assistant to the President

The White House

Washington, D.C.

Dear. Mac:

Dick Helms and I are most appreciative of the

opportunity you gave us this morning for a thorough

discussion of the Agency's various operational problems

in connection with Cuba. It was very helpful to us and

has served to clarify to a great extent our own thinking

on the future of our various operational programs.

It

might perhaps be well to set forth, in this informal

tashion, a list of the various topics which we discussed

together

with the considerations that appear to me to

apply.

In the first place, as you know very well, although

the Agency appears as the proposer of most covert action

programs at the Special Group and elsewhere, we do this

only in response to what we understand to be policy

requirements and have no interest in either commencing

or perpetuating any programs which are not demanded by

policy and which are not geared to the accomplishment of

The interdependent program of

actions which we proposed last spring and which was

accepted in June was based on three propositions which

were accepted at the time: (a) that it was in the U.s.

interest to get rid of Castro; (b) that, in attempting

to do so, the U.S. did not wish either to employ overt

force or

to raise the international "noise level" to an

unacceptable degree; and (c) that the ultimate objective

of the program was not mass uprisings but to encourage

disaffected elements within the military establishment

and other power centers of the regime to carry out a coup.

The resulting program represented a maximum covert

effort but only a minimum overall national effort which

could result in overthrowing Castro. The percentage of

chance of achieving this purpose was admittedly never

too high even had the program proceeded on full blower.

In fact the economic part of the program suffered a

serious, if not fatal, reverse with the Leyland bus

contract and subsequent moves by European suppliers to

take advantage of Castro's improved cash position.

The

sabotage raids, built into the program as a sort of

firing pin for

internal unrest and tocreate the conditions

for a coup, which was to be the main force leading to

Castro's defeat, ran only from August to December and only

The effectiveness of these

five raids is certainly debatable; there are strong pro-

ponents on both sides of the argument.

Regardless of how

that debate might come out, however, five rather low-key

raids followed by the present three-month hiatus, the

latter clearly noted by pro- and anti-Castroites

alike,

adds up to a program of a much smaller dimension than

originally envisioned which could not be expected to have

had the desired detonating effect.

circumstances well known

a very low point indeed.

In my estimation, a covert

program at this time designed to overthrow

castro is not

realistic. Acceptance of risks and noise level of a

greater magnitude than we had in mind in June would be

needed to stand a chance in view of the developments

since last June. This then raises the question of what

should happen now to the various bits and pieces of the

June program. I would like to mention these separately

and refer to some of the considerations typical to each.

The sabotage raids are conducted by Cuban exile

groups held and trained in Florida and entirely subject

to our planning and control. There are three of these

groups totaling approximately 50 men. To place them in

position and recover them there requires an extensive

maritime apparatus in florida, which likewise serves

intelligence agent infiltrations and exfiltrations.

To maintain the raiding capability on a stand-by basis

is expensive but, more importantly, the raiding groups

themselves have a relatively short shelf life; if not

employed their morale deteriorates and some of the

members, usually the best motivated,

drop out.

Replace-

ments can be acquired and trained but their caliber and

morale is in large part determined by the morale of the

exile community as a whole.

We probably can retain the

present raiding groups at roughly their current capa-

bilities for another month or two, although the well-

known Cuban volatility is capable

of causing sudden and

more rapid deterioration.

In short, we will need to know within a reasonable

time whether we should continue to effect repairs to

and keep in being our sabotage raiding apparatus. The

dismemberment of these raiding teams could be accomplished

without too much shock to the exile community. It would

has

required a good deal of hand-feeding although still within

the context of deniability..

He will probably not be ready

for his operations against Cuba before April or May of

this year.

He possesses most of his hardware and maritime

equipment and has negotiated geographical and political

bases in Central America.

Manolo Ray has been

handled

on a much more independent basis. We have furnished him

money and a certain amount of general advice. He does not

possess the physical accoutrements that Artime has and is

probably not as well equipped in terms of professional

planning. Ray has a better political image inside Cuba

among supporters of the revolution and has recently

acquired, according to reports, some of the other left-

wing exile activist groups such as Gutierrez Menoyo and

his Second Front of the Escambray.

He is said to be ready

to move. into Cuba on a clandestine basis late this spring.

His first weapon will be sabotage inside Cuba, apparently

not externally-mounted hit-and-run raids.

If U.S. policy should demand that the "autonomous"

operations be suspended, we could of course cut off our

support immediately.

Artime and his group might or might

not disintegrate at once.

Manolo Ray almost certainly

would continue. Both groups are based outside the United

States and our only real leverage on them is through our

financial support but withdrawal of this support would

probably be fatal to their operations in time.

A cutoff

rumored, especially in the case of Artime, and the collapse

of the only remaining evidence of exile action against

Castro would hit the exile community hard which is what

it in turn would do to its favorite target, U.s. policy.

The exile of today, however, appears to have lost much of

capacity for causing domestic trouble which he had a year

or two ago. The Central American countries in which the

exile bases exist would be greatly confused, although we

have carefully never indicated to the governments of these

countries any more than U.S. sympathy for the "autonomous"

groups.

We have a capacity, which is increasing, to sabotage

Cuban merchant ships calling at foreign ports. We are

emphasizing in this program the more subtle forms of

sabotage as against large explosions obviously stemming

from agent-placed bombs and limpets.

The Cuban merchant

fleet,

among the most badly run in the world, can be

helped along to a measurable degree by this program.

On the economic warfare front, as you know, we have

for many months conducted a covert denial program based

on limited capabilities directed at very narrow targets.

The effectiveness of this program is dependent on the

careful selection of items to be denied in terms of their

critical value to a key element of the Cuban economy•

Despite the virtual collapse of the U.S. overall economic

denial program against Cuba, we still retain the capacity,

using unofficial and covert

methods, to hurt but obviousLy

not to destroy certain bits of the Cuban economy.

This

effort can be complemented by carefully concealed contami-

nation of lubricants and similar actions.

Our program to get in touch with and subvert members

of the military establishment and other elite groups in

Cuba continues.. Its chance of success naturally rises

and falls with the state of morale inside Cuba as influ-

enced by the success or inactivity of our other programs

• the Uos. posture in general.

Our intelligence program continues at full force.

It will be affected by anti-Castro morale but we believe

that we can offset the effects of further deterioration

in this morale by increasingly tightened and efficient

operations.

We are seeking your advice to know which of the above

lines of actions we should continue, which we should try

to retain as a shelf capability and which to abandon..

(Of

course, intelligence collection would continue.)

As parts

of an

integrated national program designed to have at

least a fighting chance to get rid'of Castro, they seemed

to make sense;

as separate pieces they can serve to

exert some braking effect on Castro's progress, but that

is about all.

Sincerely,

FROM THE COORDINATOR OF CUBAN AFFAIRS

TO THE SPECIAL GROUP

SUBJECT:

Status Report on Autonomous Cuban Exile Groups

I. The purpose of this memorandum is to inform the members

of the Special Group as to the current state

of operational

readiness of the

autonomous Cuban exile groups which receive

U.S. Government support and to indicate what might be expected

of these groups in the relatively near future.

2. As part of the covert program authorized in June 1963;

CIA is providing financial and some technical support to two

autonomous Cuban exile groups headed respectively by Manuel Ray

5 7-I

and Manuel Artime.

I our judgment, Artime

and, to a somewiat

lesser extent, Ray, now possess the hardware and maritime

equipment as well as the geographical and political bases in

Central America needed to launch independent infiltration and

sabotage operations against Cuba.

Both groups also appear to

have reached a state of training and psychological readiness

which could impel their leaders to launch operations against

Cuba at almost any time and with little or no notice to the

U.S. Government.

3. The possibillty of imminent unilateral operations on

the part of the autonomous groups is brought to the attention

of the Special Group at this time since it is related to the

question of the luture of CIA-controllod sabotago aid harass-,

ment operations now under review by higher authority. This

relationship was described in Part V of the memorandum

entitled "Review of Current Program of Covert Action Against

Cuba," dated 24 January 1964, Ha

Tinald ba nobella

that if a policy decision is made to terminate sabotage and

harassment operations for the autonomous groups as well as for

CIA, it will be necessary to terminate support for the auto-

nomous groups as CIA would not be in a position to insure

that they would refrain from raids and sabotage even if so

THEn: 51555740424595iftolhenattssmp-

requested.

In fact, it

now appears likely that neither group

will disintegrate at once upon notification of termination of

U.S. subsidies. While withdrawal of U.S. financial aid and

moral support would probably be fatal to their operations in

time, they are likely to make strenuous efforts to find other

sources of support. In so doing and in order to prove their

viability to potential supporters, they would, in their des-

peration, probably feel compelled to launch one or more

dramatic raids against Cuba.

COURSES OF ACTION

A. Can Live mith castro

1. Negotiato a detente with Fidel looking towards

DRAFT

3/22/64

U.S. Policy Towards Cuba

April to November, 1964

I. General

The minimum objective of our Cuban policy will be a Cuba which poses

no threat to its neighbors (militarily or subversively) and which is not a

Soviet satellite.

In moving towards this dual objective, we will continue

• to reject the options of unprovoked U.S. military intervention in Cuba and

of an effective total blockade around Cuba - primarily bécause they would

risk another US/USSR confrontation.

Instead, we will continue to engage in a variety of unilateral, bilateral,

and multilateral actions and pressures, both defensive and offensive, which

stop short of military intervention/ blockade. The application of these actions

and pressures will be tempered slightly be the domestic political situation;

while we do not want to appear as "coexisting with the Soviet satellite";

insofar as possible, we will apply pressures against Cuba in such a way

that, in the absence of unusual occurrences, we will "keep the lid on" Cuba

and, maintain a low temperature in the Caribbean. It is axiomatic that we

will continue to be prepared and plan for the unusual - e. g. a revolt against

the regime, a U-2 shoot-down, a Castro decision to eject the Russians.

Here are some details of our objectives and of the measures we will take

between now and November.

II. Objective -- Containment of the Cuban Threat

We will try to insure that Cuba poses no threat to its neighbors, either

militarily or subversively. To this end we will continue to take a number of

defensive measures which aim at three primary targets.

A. Cuba, the Military Threat -- We will continue to insure that Cuba does

not become again an offensive weapons (e. g. missiles) threat to the U.S. or

Latin America.

To this end we will continue to collect intelligence from

within Cuba and to conduct intensive air and sea surveillance around and

over Cuba. In this regard; we will make it clear to the Cubans that dire

consequences will ensue if they interfere with our air surveillance of Cuba.

We will also make it clear to the Soviets that we do not intend to tolerate a

shoot-down of a U-2.by the Cubans; it is in the Soviet interest to do everything

possible to prevent the Cubans from doing this.

• To discourage possible Cuban military attack against its neighbors, as

appropriate, we will continue to put ourselves clearly on record that any

such Cuban moves will have extremely serious consequences for Cuba.

B. Soviet Military Personnel -- We will continue to try to effect the re-

moval of Soviet military personnel from Cuba. To this end we will continue

to make it eminently clear to the Soviets that we cannot tolerate the per-

manent assignment of Soviet military personnel to Cuba. As appropriate, we

will tell the Russians that they do not need a military establishment in Cuba

to prevent the Cubans from shooting down a U-2.

TOP SECRET - EYES ONLY

- 3 - .

C. Subversion -- We will contínue to do everything we can to impede and,

it possible, to stop Cuban based and supported subversion in the Hemisphere.

To this end we will make a special effort, bilaterally and in multilateral

forums, to direct Latin American attention to and to assist (materially where

appropriate) Latin American efforts in the problems of controlling internal

insurgency and of controlling the subversive movement of people, funds, arms,

and propaganda between Latin America and Cuba.

Appropriate OAS action on the up-coming arms cache issue can take us a

long way in our effort to strengthen our counter-subversion program.

Specifically, we want the following.

1. We want the OAS resolution (Article 2) in flexible and general language,.

to wain Castro that the OAS will not stand by idly if he continues his sub-

versive efforts. This language will be cognate with a possible Presidential

statement along similar lines to the U.S. public and with a stern private

warning to the Russians that Cuban subversion is leading to a highly dangerous

situation. Hopefully, this language will deter Castro from further subversive

actions; among other things the Russians may find it in their interest to control

Castro more closely. Also, such language will provide a juridical umbrella

for, and preposition the OAS and/ or the U.S. to use force against Cuba in

the

future if it is deemed desirable to do so.

While such warning language is highly important and will be tough to get,

we will not bargain away the rest of the proposed resolution in an effort to get

it.

2.. We want the OAS resolution (Article 4(c)) to call for the suspension

of all air and sea communications between Cuba and OAS countries. This

will considerably increase Cuba's difficulty in exporting subversives, es-

pecially if the Cuban/ Mexican air link is cut.

This article of the resolution is of high priority but may not be tough to

get.

3. We want the OAS resolution (Article 3) to call for the establishment

of a surveillance system which will permit the stopping and searching in

territorial waters of all vessels suspect of carrying arms and subversives;

a similar air surveillance system will also be established. While there are

some negative aspects to such a resolution (few, if any, arms will be found),

there

are good reasons for having it. First, since an arms cache is involved,

we must at a minimum make a bow towards the problem of controlling arms

shipments. Also, the resolution will be viewed as a tightening measure, and

the fact that no further arms shipments occur can be interpreted as a result

of the establishment of a surveillance system. Second, it will possibly deter

Castro somewhat from sending men and arms to Latin America. Third, it will

provide a peg on which to hang closer and more effective bilateral cooperation

which may be called for in the future. For example, the U.S. and Venezuela

may want to work out an arrangement whereby U.S. vessels can enter

Venezuelan waters to assist in the seizure of a suspect vessel. Fourth, while

it will give us an instrument to harass Castro marginally, it has no significant

escalation implications.

This article is of medium priority but should be relatively easy to get.

4. We want the OAS resolution to encourage further steps within the

Hemisphere to counter Castro/ Communist subversion.

We want a condem-

nation of the Castro regime (Article l), a renewed call for alert against

Castro/ Communist subversion and an endorsement of the Lavalle Committee

recommendations outlining specific measures on controlling travel, funds,

and propaganda for subversive purposes (Article 7).

These articles of the resolution should be easy to get, but are of low

priority.

IlI. Objective -- Removal of the Soviet Satellite from the Hemisphere

We will continue our attempts to break the Cuba/ Bloc tie-line and to re-

move the Soviet satellite from the Hemisphere.

A. General Description of U.S. Approach -- Generally speaking, we hope

to remove the Soviet satellite from the Hemisphere by a series of offensive

measures which will intensify Cuba's already serious economic difficulties;.

which will increase the cost and unpleasantness to the Soviets of maintaining

Cuba; and which will stimulate directly and indirectly, internal resistance to

the regime. This effort, complemented by our defensive measures, hopefully

will lead finally to one of the following three eventualities, each of which

constitutes

a removal of the Soviet satellite from the Hemisphere.

1. Overthrow of the Castro Regime -- By exerting pressure on Cuba, we

might be able to bring about a degree of disorganization, uncertainty, and

discontent in Cuba which will predispose elements in the power centers of

DocId: 32423484 Page 126

= 6-

the regime to bring about the overthrow

of the Castro/ Communist regime

and the elimination of the Soviet presence in Cuba; at some stage of the revolt,

it is likely that direct or indirect U.S. support will be needed to insure its

success.

Theoretically, the Cuban people, tired of economic hardship, lack

of freedom, and isolated from their Latin American brethern, will embrace

the revolt.

2. Accommodation with Castro on U.S. Terms -- Our present policy

could lead Castro to agree to break his tie-line with the USSR and stop his

subversion efforts. It is eu conceivable that such factors as (1) U.S. isolation

and covert measures; (2) further Cuban economic deterioration in spite of

Soviet aid; (3) distrust of Soviet intentions; (4) the psychological and real

impact on Castro of the OAS resolution; and (5) the realization by Castro that

he can never be the man he wants to be and that Cuba can never be the place

he wants it to be until he comes to terms with the U.S.; will lead Castro to

the accommodation option. Indeed, there is a substantial body of evidence

is net

that Castro may already be thinking along these lines, although there are also

3. A Soviet Decision to Quit Cuba -- A Soviet decision to quit Cuba cannot

be dismissed categorically in view of such factors as (l) the lack of real

Soviet progress in making Cuba a "show piece", (2) the obvious U.S. deter-

mination to make Cuba a "dead end" in the Hemisphere (no more Cuba's will

be permitted), (3) the magnitude of Soviet aid to Cuba, and (4) the extent of

the USSR's own present economic problems. At the least, these factors

would appear to have a bearing on how the Russians would view their ejection

from Cuba either by the overthrow of the Castro regime, or by a Castro

decision to accommodate with the U.S. on U.S. terms.

Relief would con-

ceivably be mixed generously with Russian grief, especially if the Russians

could find a vaguely credible fig-leaf.

B. Specific Measures We Will Take -- In puring the tough, nasty, but

no military intervention/blockade policy, which probably lays the best ground-

work for bringing about any of the three eventualities which would constitute

a removal of the Soviet satellite from the Hemisphere, we will take the fol-

lowing measures.

1. Political Isolation of Cuba -- We will continue our efforts to isolate

Cuba politically; we will continue to demonstrate that Cuba has taken a "wrong

turn" and is condemned for it by the Free Wold, and especially by Latin

America. One reason for this dimension of our policy is that there are

numerous indications that political isolation wounds Castro deeply on a

psychological level, Conceivably, the desire for acceptability by the West

a2.

eventually will be an important factor in

„Castro realization that he can't have

it both ways, and in an ultimate Castro decision to eject the Russians and

make peace with the West. Another reason for this aspect of our policy is

that political isolation hampers Cuba's subversive activities; for example, it

denies him the use of diplomatic missions in target countries to promote

revotutton. purpoes.

Appropriate OAS action on the arms cache issue can further our policy of

political isolation; accordingly, we want the OAS resolution to encourage the

following steps: First, we want the remaining five OAS countries, which

maintain diplomatic and consular relations with Cuba, to sever such relations

(resalation is it acted).

(Article 4(a)), Second, we want the suspension of all trade, except food and

medicines, between Cuba and the OAR's (Article 4(b)). Since such trade is

already very small this step may have greater political than economic signif-

icance (although, on the economic side, it will demonstrate OAS solidarity on

the question of trade with Cuba). Third, we want a general call to Free World

countries to cooperate with us in our effort to isolate Cuba economically and

politically (Article 5).

NOTE: In the context of the whole resolution, we regard the breaking of

diplomatic relations as a matter of medium priority; furthermore, we recog-

nize that it will be very tough to get. The priority of the suspension of trade

and of the general call for Free World cooperation, is treated betew in the

following section.

Economic Denial Program -- Generally speaking, we will continue in

our efforts to keep Free World/Cuban trade, particularly in critical com-

modities, at a low level - through overt and covert, legal and extra-legal,

diplomatic and private means. To this end a special effort will be made over

the next few weeks to obtain NATO, and particularly British, cooperation in

DocId: 32423484 Page 129

Lyndon B. Johnson Library

---

## Page 130

TOP SECRET - EYES ONLY

1-9-

this over-all effort, especially with respect to the extension of export credit

guarantess to firms wishing to trade with Cuba.

Also, we will prepare now for the eventuality that our further efforts to

obtain voluntary Free World cooperation will not be successful. First, as a

matter of very high priority, we will push for language in the ecoming OAS

resolution which will provide a basis for possible unilateral U.S. action to

reduce Cuban/ Free World commercial relations (e. g. the proclaimed list)

and, more importantly, which will encourage as many OAR's as possible to

join us in our effort (Articles 4(b), 5, and 6). It should be noted that such

language will not be difficult to get.

At present, one of the major obstacles to our effort in the field of economic

denial is the non-OAS Free World argument that the U.S. is the only country

in the Western Hemisphere which is really concerned about Cuba. To counter

this argument, we must demonstrate clearly that the Hemisphere regards Cuba

as a threat, that the Hemisphere

supports the isolation policy, that the Hem-

isphere looks with disfavor upon traders who do business with Castro, and

that the Hemisphere intends to take appropriate action against such traders.

Second, sometime before the OAS consultative meeting on the Venezuelan

arms cache, we will complete a study which will project the level and type of

Free World trade with Cuba for 1964. This study will take into account our

present efforts in NATO. Third, sometime before the OAS consultative meeting

on the arms cache, we will complete a scenario of actions we can take to

increase the effectiveness of our economic denial program, in the event this is

DocId:32423484 Page 130

---

## Page 131

TOP SECRET - EYES ONLY

-10-

deemed necessary. This scenario will include, but will not necessarily

be limited to, a plan of action which will result in a meeting with hard-line

OAR's (e.g. Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, Sal-

vador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador) to devise means

of implementing the economic denial language of the OAS resolution. Such

means, which may. differ from OAR to OAR, should make it clear to Free

World firms that they can't have it both ways and that they must choose be-

tween Cuba, with a population of 7, 000, 000 and selected OAS countries

whose populations. total in the hundreds of millions. In selling this proposal

to the OAR's, we will point out, inter alia, that they will not be forced to

few

sacrifice much in real terms since there will be relatively/Free World traders

who will ultimately choose the Cuban market in such circumstances.

Indeed,

only Cuba will be seriously hurt.

3. Free World Shipping -- We will continue our efforts to reduce Free

World shipping to Cuba. First, we will .try to ensure that the Lebanese finally

effect their proposed shipping legislation.

Second, we will continue our efforts

with HMG and individual British shippers to reduce British shipping to Cuba..

Third, we will continue our efforts to ensure that no new Free World faces

enter the trade to pick up the slack which recent withdrawals have left.

Fourth, we will keep in mind the favorable aspects of the OAS resolution

(Article 4(c)) which will not permit Free World ships to call at OAS ports if

they are proceeding to our from Cuba and which will therefore further discourage

Free World shipping to Cuba.

4. Air Service to and from Cuba -- We will continue our efforts to reduce,

restrict, and harass Free World and Communist air services to and from

Cuba. Passage of an OAS resolution which suspends air communication be-

tween Cuba and OAR's (Article 4(c)) will be helpful in this regard.

5.

Covert Program -- Our policy of pressures against Cuba will include a

modest covert program; at the same time, this program will be consistent

with our intention of "keeping the lid on" Cuba and of maintaining a low

temperature in the Caribbean.

First, we will continue to collect intelligence.

Second, CIA-controlled radio programs and other propaganda media, directed

at Cuba will continue to encourage low risk, simple sabotage, and other forms

of active and passive resistence and to stimulate tension within the regime and

between Cuba and the Soviet Bloc. Third, CIA will continue to work with State

to deny to Cuba the commodities it needs.

Fourth, CIA will continue trying to

identify, seek out, and establish contact with potentially dissident non-Com-

munist elements in the power centers of the regime.

Fifth,

CIA will continue

sukipard

to aid autonomous Cuban exile groups and individuals. Of utmost importance in

these autonomous exile operations is that U.S. involvement must be clearly

deniable and that these operations will not lead to an intolerable escalation in

the Caribbean (e.g. a Cuban air attack on Nicaragua). If it becomes apparent

V.S.

that this is not possible, withdrawal of support will be considered.

Until further

notice, CIA will not direct any further sabotage efforts against

Cuba. In this regard, CIA will disband, as discreetly as possible, its sabotage

raiding apparatus

in Florida.

---

## Page 133

TOP SECRET - EYES ONLY

- 12-

CIA will keep on the shelf its capacity to sabotage Cuban merchant ships

calling

at foreign ports.

6. Contact with Castro -- We will establish a deniable contact with

Castro and delicately inject into the very tenuous and marginal U.S. / Cuban

dialogue an option which Castro presently may not think exists - i.e. that

we would consider assisting Cuba and guaranteeing Castro's existence if on

his part he would stop his subversion and break his tie-line with the Bloc.

(If consummated, such a deal would constitute a magnificent victory for the

U.S. - the ejection of the Soviets from the Western Hemisphere after the

penetration had been made.) There are a number of arguments in favor of

talking to Castro.

First, while it is obviously a long shot, Castro could conceivably buy

accommodation on U.S. terms. There is a substantial body of evidence

which points to Castro's unhappiness with the present state of affairs and to

his eagerness to negotiate a settlement. In this regard, the OAS resolution

may have a special impact on Castro. If it turns out to be a tough one, the

door which is now slightly ajar for Castro (deterioration of our isolation

policy) and which is giving him much comfort and psychological lift, will be

slammed shut. Second, talks with Castro will tend to intensify Cuban/ Soviet

tensions.

Third, U.S. / Cuban talks will tend to keep Castro cool during a

time when we want the noise-level low. For example, between now and

November we will be especially concerned about the possibility of Castro

shooting down a U-2 and causing a pre-election flap in the Caribbean. From

past experience it is fair to say that Castro will probably act with a certain

amount of restraint if he feels there is

a chance we might come to terms with

him.

Fourth, the disadvantages of talking to Castro appear minimal. There

will probably be no leakage in view of the fact that it is also in Castro's interest

to keep quiet. If there is leakage, we can probably deny it credibly - e. g. "This

is too funny for words. Castro accuses us daily of trying to destroy him and

hatching heinous plots against him. Many of our close allies (including

Senator Fulbright) tell us we are being too nasty to Cuba in our isolation

efforts. We are constantly being accused of moving faster than the OAS. This

is the most incredible charge yet." In the highly unlikely event that there is

leakage and we can't deny it, we can take the line which is essentially true

-- e.g. "Castro wanted to tell us something and we agreed to listen. We

would be derelict in protecting the national interest if we refused to listen.

Our policy is unchanged. So long as Cuba continues its subversive efforts

and maintains its ties with the Bloc, there can be no easing of tensions."

In going ahead with U.S. / Cuban contact, we will follow at least the

following basic guidelines. First, we will not, in any way, relax our present

pressures against Castro. These are our bargaining levers. Second, we

will ooze confidence. Castro should get the feeling that we are in no hurry

and are content to continue on our present course. However, we are reasonable

men and are not after Castro's head per se. Third, we will spin the negotiations

out; this will not be hard in view of the communication difficulties. At the

same time, however,

we will stay loose. If, per chance, it appears that we

can eject the Soviets

and,

at the

same time, believe it will benefit rather

than hinder the Administration in November, we may want to speed up the

time-table rather than wait to collect the dividend after November. (It might

be noted that a deal with Castro before November might not necessarily be

unmanageable from a domestic viewpoint. Obviously, the President could

not live with a headline which reads "U.S. Accommodates with Castro." On

the other hand, he might live superbly with headlines which read "USSR Ejected

from Cuba"' or "USSR/ Cuba Tie-Line Broken." The loyal opposition would

not be in a perfect position to complain.

After all, they permitted the

establishment of the tie-line and never could do anything about it via soft

methods -- before mid-1960, or by hard methods -- after mid-1960.)

IV. Objective -- Planning for Contingencies

We will continue to prepare for contingencies which may occur in Cuba.

We will also review all contingency plans which are in existence to ensure they

are current.

V. Objective - Containment of Cuba as a Negative Election Issue

The measures we will take to contain Cuba as a negative campaign issue

will detract little, if at all, from what our policy would probably be in the

absence of an electión.

These measures will be essentially mitigating in

character.

Here are some pertinent elements:

A. Public Posture -- The picture we will portray to the American public

will be one of confidence, strength, and determination: First, the U.S. is no

longer directly threatened by Cuba. We are firm in our resolve to maintain

this position.

Second, the real Cuban threat is subversion against Latin

America. While we intend to aid the Hemisphere as much as possible in the

fight against subversion, the control of subversion is and must necessarily be

primarily the responsibility of the target countries; in this regard, we and

other OAR's are confident that we can contain the Cuban subversive threat.

be

Third, "another Cuba" in the Hemisphere will not/permitted. Fourth, we are

doing everything reasonably possible to remove the Soviet satellite from the

Hemisphere by weakening the structure of the Cuban economy and by increasing

the Soviet burden of supporting Cuba. These economic measures also increase

Cuba's difficulties in finding the resources to support its subversive effortsy

B. Keeping the Lid On and the Noise-Level Down -- We will avoid actions

which appear to be only marginally advantageous to the furtherance of U.S.

policy and which are likely to lead to an increase of tension and temperature in

the Caribbean. For example, CIA will not conduct sabotage operations, which

-15.-

can be convincingly traced back to us.

Or again, we will not take actions

against Cuba purely for the sake of needling Castro and which bring us no

concrete reward (e.g. stopping and searching Cuba ships on the high seas;

non-return.of Russian helicopter).

While there are excellent national security reasons for talking with Castro,

these talks,

as noted above, will also tend to temper violent Castro reactions

to unforeseen events which

are bound to occur between now and November.

C. Keeping the Pressure On Cuba -- Domestic political considerations

reinforce our national security decision to keep a reasonable amount of pressure

on Cuba - pressure which is still consistent with our decision against miliary

intervention/ blockade and which is still consistent with our decision to keep

the lid on Cuba:

Also, we must recognize that such things as the extent of Free World com-

mercial relations with Cuba have become, ta do peonton symbols to the

American public of U.S. resolve not to coexist wih Castro. Therefore, while

the limitation of Free World/ Cuban commercial relations is important on

on

national security grounds, it takes * added importance because of the domestic

political situation.

VEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

•SUBJECT: Cuba - Miscellaneous

1. Autonomous Exile Groups - You might want to glance over the attached

memorandum for the record which Peter Jessup drafted after your meeting

with Dick Helms and Des Fitzgerald. The memo implies that we can expect

to see some activity in the near future and indicates that you will ensure

that the President fully understands the implications of autonomous exile

group activities.

2. Talks with Castro - I have given Des Fitzgerald and John Crimmins a

rundown of the Bill Attwood/ Lisa Howard activities. Using a "need to know"

criterion, I gave Des a minimum dosage. He read the longish memorandum

covering my New York conversation with Lisa Howard. I also told him that

we have not replied to Castro's message to the President via Lisa Howard.

I gave John Crimmins a pretty full treatment. He read the Bill Attwood

chronology and several memos regarding my recent talks with Lisa Howard.

•John and I talked about the desirability of reopening the dialogue with Cuba

while Castro is at a low point. I pointed out the advantages of a slow dialogue

whose timing we could control. Among other things, even if it didn't lead

to the ejection of the Russians, it might prevent Castro from doing something

rash between now and November - such as shooting down a U-2. John was

surprisingly receptive and noted that Castro will be feeling very low during

this time-frame as a result of the trial of Rodriguez, the revolution in Brazil,

and the OAS resolution on the Venezuelan arms cache. He did not commit

himself, but seemed more receptive than he was several months ago.

3. OAS Resolution - Ward Allen estimates that the chances are better than

even that the Venezuelan arms cache will be taken up at a C/OAS rather than

at an MEM (attached is a cable which gives a flavor for the problem).

Ward said that a C/OAS resolution can come out just as strongly as an MEM

resolution. He guesses that we probably will be able to get about 75% of what

we want. The warning article may get watered down and we probably will not

get a recommendation regarding the breaking of diplomatic relations.' How-

ever, we may get just about everything else.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

A meeting was held at 1015 on 9 April by Mr. Bundy,

Desmond FitzGerald

and Richard Helms to discuss the problem

of independent action by Cuban emigre groups headed by

Manuel Artime and Manolo Ray. The following points were made:

1.01550A5100.

verbal Fitzgerald dared that he did nots eleve ame

in his determination to mount an operation from Central

America.

Those present agreed that it was possible to

block the operation bj an air-sea search and by the

use of U.S. Navy destroyer but that this was a drastic

step.

Mr. Helms pointed out that this could write finis

to use of Cuban emigre groups and would radiate con-

siderable fallout elsewhere.

Mr. Bundy capsuled the problem by saying his worry

was whether an Artime attack would give the U.S. a hypo-

critical image when out of the other side of its mouth the

U.S. was plumping for votes at the OAS to outlaw subversion

and

armed attack.

He further said that he wanted to be clear as to whether

higher authority fully grasped the implications of the auto-

nomous exile group activity as discussed at Tuesday's meeting.

This he was going to check.

Mr. Bundy felt it would be extremely useful to regularly

publicize Castroite guerrilla activity both in Argentina

(thus far played only by the Christian Science Monitor.) and

in Central America as a contrasting backdrop to possible

Castro

slurs against Cuban exile activity.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20301

JCSM-253-64

21 WAR 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

Subject: Possible Actions Against the Castro Government (C)

1. At your meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on March 4, 1964,

you directed them to concentrate their attention on possible ways of

obtaining greater support from the Organization of American States

(OAS) in carrying out a program directed at the eventual overthrow of

the Castro government. Also, you asked that they examine additional

ways of bringing pressure upon Castro beyond those presently authorized.

2. With regard to possible actions by the OAS, the Joint Chiefs of

Staff consider that the United States Government should seek the cooper-

ation of the other OAS members in obtaining the complete isolation of

Cuba from other American States. Further, the United States should,

if possible, secure broad authority for a wide range of actions under

Article 8 of the Rio Treaty, including the possible use of armed force

to broad y their he he

against Cuba, should OAS members, individually or collectively, deem

such action necessary to prevent further intervention and aggression by

Castro.

With these possible objectives

for OAS action in mind, the

Joint Chiefs of Staff have studied the text of the proposed OAS resolution

which the United States has suggested that the Venezuelan Government

propose for the consideration of the OAS member states. They consider

that if such a resolution is adopted essentially in its present form, the

United States Government will have sufficient basis for action directed

at the further isolation of Cuba and for military action against Castro

in case of further aggression on his part.

Hence, for the time being,

they have nothing additional to suggest in this field.

3. With regard to measures designed to put additional pressure on

Castro beyond those presently authorized, the Joint Chiefs of Staff

recommend a resumption of the program (which is presently approved

but on which no actions are currently being taken) involving the employ-

ment of covert assets to conduct interdependent operations, including

the covert collection of intelligence, propaganda actions, economic

denial actions, and externally mounted sabotage operations against

Cuba.

As this program unfolds, they would favor expanding and

intensifying it while maintaining a continuing evaluation of the reactions

of Castro, the communists, and the Free World. Concurrently, they

favor the development and conduct of a hard-line propaganda campaign,

integrated with the foregoing actions, to estrange the Castro regime

from the Cuban people and the remainder of the Free World.

4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff continue to believe that the ultimate

United States objective toward Cuba must be to establish a government

in Cuba that is acceptable to the United States. However, they have

difficulty identifying promising actions against Castro which have not

been previously considered, and in some cases tried. It is a hard fact

that little remains which offers promise of real effectiveness in removing

Castro short of a blockade or an ascending scale of military action up to

or including invasion. They will keep this problem under continuing

review and advise you should any new and promising courses of action

be uncovered.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Possible Luncheon Meeting Items - Cuba

Here is a suggested Cuba menu for today's luncheon meeting, which you

may want to use in full, in part, or not at all.

11. Contingency Plan for Shoot-Down of a U-2 -- In view of the most recent

Cuban statements (Castro on Sunday, and Dorticos on Monday) you may

want to brief the President, if he hasn't been briefed already, on our con-

tingency planning in the event Castro shoots down a U-2. The plan is at-

tached at Tab 1.

" Z. Talks with Castro -- You indicated that you might want to discuss with

the President and the two Secretaries the question of resuming the tenuous

and marginal dialogue with Castro. This track may have special significance

in light of Castro's Sunday speech; one of its attractions is that it might tend

to keep Castro's temperature low and "the lid on" over the next six months.

Attached at Tab 2 is a recent staff memo which points up some of the dimen-

sions of the problem. Attached at Tab 3 is a possible scenario for resuming

the dialogue.

3. Rules of Engagement -- If you think it appropriate, you might see if the

President has approved DOD's Rules of Engagement covering a situation in

which the Cubans attack friendly foreign military aircraft or ships operating

in the area around Cuba.. An answer to DOD is over-due.

4. Contingency Plan for a Coup in Cuba -- You may have handled this one

already. I'm not sure, however, and put it before you again, primarily in

deference to Alexis Johnson; on two occasions he has suggested that the

President be informed of the existence of the plan (on one occasion, he sug-

gested that the two Secretaries be present). Attached at Tab 4 is a staff memo

which briefs and covers the package from Alexis Johnson regarding contingency

planning for a coup in Cuba.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Special Group - Cuba

1. Continued exile raids are going

to make it tougher to keep the lid on Cuba

between now and November.

This is just the sort of thing that evokes a highly

emotional response from Castro.

As things stand, he seems convinced that

we are tied into the raids -- as indeed we are.

2. There seem to be two things we can do.

(a) We can make a real effort to stop the raids. While CIA says that this

can't be done, I wonder if that's true. For example, the cessation of assistance

and pressure on countries like Nicaragua to cease providing facilities might do

the trick.

This step is a drastic one and could lead to angry charges (in the U.S. and

elsewhere) that we are lending positive support to Castro. It is probably a step

we would not want to take unless it became clear that these exile raids, which we

can't control, were propelling us to the brink.

(b) We can cut off all our ties with these erile groups (e. g. money, equipment,

intelligence information). The exile grapevine is a sensitive one and the word

will get around that we are really not involved. Hopefully, this word will get to

Fidel and he will keep his eye focussed on the exiles rather than on us (specifically,

a U-2).

In sum, at a minimum, we might want to be impregnable to the charge

that we are connected in any way with these exile activities.

3.. This strikes me as an urgent problem which we should grapple with now. More-

over, there may be a good deal-of support in town in favor of doing something. My

talks at State indicate that Alexis Johrison, Tom Mann, and John Crimmins are

also unhappy about the presenttend of events.

4.

You may want to initiate a discussion of this matter at the Special Group meet-

ing today.

P.S, We might want to made i diti Cordon Chaga

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: British Guiana and Cuba

1. British Guiana - Janet Jagan Quits Post -- As you have probably read in

the cable traffic, Janet Jagan has quit her post as Minister of Home Affairs.

The apparent reason is that she was frustrated because she had no concrete

control over the police force, which, by the way, is predominantly African

(1300 out of 1500). It is not yet clear what the significance of her step might be;

it could turn out to be a negative for our side in that it may encourage the East

Indians to stir up more trouble.

The situation in British Guiana does not yet seem to be excessively grim, but

we seem to be watching it closely.

2. Cuba - OAS Resolution -- State says that soundings on whether to hold an

1FM or a C/OAS are running in favor of an MFM. Frequently expressed reasons

V are (a) that an MFM meets Venezuelan desires, (b) that an MEM enhances the

importance of the resolution, and (c) that the legality of sanctions taken under a

C/OAS are questionable.

Mexico and Chile favor a C/OAS.

3. Free World Trade with Cuba -- State informally guesses that a projection of

I Free World trade with Cuba for 1964 would show exports at about $180 million;

this compares with about $110-120 million in 1963.

I have been needling State to get on with some contingency planning in the event

we decide that the level of trade for 1964 looks as though it may be intolerable;

Sta, no in the prodie paperwhich misse ove soverestine otto

buy from firms which trade with Cuba in significant quantities of goods. This is

an interesting thought since much purchasing in Latin America is probably done on

government account.

4. Execution of Anti-Castro Cubans -- Attached is a ticker indicating that the

Cubans have executed three anti-Castro Cubans and jailed two others as CIA agents..

CIA tells me that we did have a connection with the executed Cubans but that it is

ompletely deniable. The Agency is still checking on the other two.

Plans of Cuban Exiles to Assassinate

Selected Cuban Government Leaders

1.

The following report was compiled from informa-

tion obtained by Agency officers from persons who were

parties to the actions described.

Agency officers made

clear to each of the sources that the United States

Government would not, under any circumstances, condone

the planned actions.

Presumably the sources of the

report, in submitting this information, were motivated

in part by the belief that by disclosing the information

they would obtain immunity against legal action should

they succeed in implementing the plan.

A Cuban exile was approached on 2 March 1964 by

an acquaintance who wished to discuss a plan, which was

still in the embryonic state, to assassinate Fidel Castro.

The acquaintance was described as a businessman and a

Shipowner who owns at least one ship which sails under

the British flag,

and who also has a legally sanctioned

interest in distributing and placing slot machines in

gambling houses.

The involvement of the acquaintance in

the slot-machine business brings the man in contact with

elements in the

underworld, primarily through his partner

who is a former police officer from St. Louis and through

whom there is a tie-in with elements of "Cosa Nostra."

The "Cosa Nostra" elements are alleged to have numerous

contacts still available to them in Cuba,

and they have

offered to assassinate Castro for $150,000; no advance

funds were requested. If the mission cannot be accom-

plished, or if the plan is unsuccessful, an amount not

to exceed $10,000 would be paid for the

travel and living

expenses of five men involved in the mission.

The Cuban

exile commented that he believed he had been

approached

with this plan because of his family's wealth; he told

his acquaintance that he was not interested and suggested

that an approach might be made to someone who has much more

money.

3.

Another Cuban exile reported that Byron Cameron,

owner and operator of the M/V CAYMAN HOPE, whose address

is Caribe Trading Co., Ltd., Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, met

with several Cuban exiles on 3 March 1964.

persons attending the meeting were Teofilo Babun Franco,

co-owner of the Antillean Marine Shipping Corporation,

Miami, and two of Babun's employees, Oscar Fernandez

and Eliseo Gomez Fernandez.

Babun and Cameron

friendly shipping-business competitors in the Caribbean

area. During the course of conversation at this meeting,

Cameron mentioned that he was in contact with an unidenti-

fied group which would be willing to assassinate selected

Cuban officials for cash; specifically, the Cameron group

is interested in

assassinating Fidel Castro, Raul Castro,

and Ernesto "Che" Guevara.

4. After a preliminary discussion at the 3 March

meeting, it was thought that the amount of $150,000 for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $5,000 expense

money, payable in advance, was too high, and Babun felt

that

this situation was just another attempt to swindle

patriotic Cuban exiles.

Another meeting was then held

on 5 March and a counter-offer of $100,000 was made for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $2,500 for ex-

penses, payable in advance.

Cameron promised to check

with his contacts after returning from a trip to the

Caribbean.

During a meeting on 15 March attended by Cameron

and Babun and his associates, the following terms were

agreed upon for the assassination of the Cuban officials:

Fidel Castro, $100,000; Raul Castro, $20,000; Ernesto

"Che" Guevara, $20,000; and $2,500 for expenses, payable

in advance.

The time-limit for the proposed mission

would be 90 days from the date when Babun could verify,

to the satisfaction of Cameron, that he had $100,000 at

his disposal for the payment.

The contract for payment

would be honored only upon the presentation of evidence

that the three Cuban officials died at the hands of the

assassins connected with Cameron's contacts.

6.

In early April 1964 Eliseo Gomez Fernandez met

with Jose "Pepin" Bosch.

Bosch agreed to advance $100,000

and Babun and his associates would

advance $2,500 for

expenses.

Julio Lobo Olavarria, a wealthy Cuban exile

in New York, subsequently agreed to the terms, provided

that his name was not involved. Accordingly, Babun gave

Cameron $2,500 on 25 April. Cameron then advised his

group, and

on 25 April he reported that his group had

already called its man in Cuba and told him to proceed

as planned and that "their other man" would be heading

for Cuba shortly. The final comment was "we hope to

have some good news for you between 20 and 25 May."

Lobo planned to fly to Miami on 19 May to arrange

the transfer of $100,000 to a safety deposit box, the

keys to which are to

be held jointly by Cameron and a

confidant of Lobo.

7.

The identities of the persons in the Cameron

group and how they plan to proceed with this mission

are not known. Babun's associates are reluctant to

make any unnecessary queries because they have invested

$2,500 and because Cameron made it fairly clear at the

beginning that the Mafia was involved. Cameron re-

vealed during the negotiations that his contact was a

police officer in the St. Louis, Missouri, Vice Squad

who was about to retire and who has numerous connections

in the Mafia.

Cameron implied that "the other man" in

question is in Spain.

Cameron knows that he could be

indicted for conspiracy and that if there is any

treachery on his part,

Babun and his associates would

not hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE.

8.

In late May 1964 a prominent Cuban exile who

spoke with Jose "Pepin" Bosch reported that Teofilo

Babun and Eliseo Gomez had a plan under way to assas-

sinate Fidel Castro for the payment of $150,000. Bosch

claimed that he had committed himself to furnish

$50,000 and that he was hoping he could get the balance

Bosch indicated that he believes that a

MEMORANDUM FOR

MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Assassination of Castro

1. Attached is a memorandum from CLA describing

a plot to assassinate Castro which would involve, U.S.

elements of the Mafia and which would be financed by.

Pepin Bosch.

2. John Crimmins is looking into the matter, is plan-

ning to talk to Alexis Johnson about it, and feels that

the matter should be discussed at a Special Group

meeting. John's own inclination is that the U.S. Gov-

ernment cannot knowingly permit any criminal American

involvement in this sort of thing and should go all out to

stop the plot. This would involve sicking the FBI on the

American criminal elements involved and intervening

with Bosch.

I have not yet thought this one through and respectfully

withhold judgment.

MEMORANDUM FOR

MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT:

Reappraisal of Autonomous Operations

1. Attached is a copy of Dez Fitzgerald's "'A Reap-

praisal of Automous Operations."

It was apparently

• instigated by Tom Mann's expressed feeling that if

we mean what we say under the warning paragraph of

the OAS resolution (subversion is aggression), we

should keep our own hands clean and cease support of

autonomous exile operations. The meat of Dez' paper

begins on page 5 (at the paper clip); much of his logic

and conclusions, frankly, leave me stone cold.

2. In essence, my own view differs from Tom Mann's

in that I dislike the raids primarily for a different

reason -- i.e. because Castro now appears to have the

capability to shoot down a U-2 and because I regard

Castro as the type of man who can react highly emotionally

and irrationally when excessively provoked. The corol-

lary of this view is that the raids would be somewhat more

tolerable (though still troublesome between now and Novem-

ber) if we could somehow remove Castro's shoot-down

capability -- i.e. find an alternative to the U-2.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Special Group - Autonomous Exile Groups

I understand there will be a general discussion of autonomous exile groups

at the Special Group meeting today. Here are a few points which you might

find useful.

I. There are a number of disadvantages in the status quo. First, at best,

these raids will make it tougher to keep the lid on Cuba between now and

November. This is just the sort of thing that can evoke a highly irrational

response from Castro.

As things stand, Castro seems convinced that we are

tied irto the raids -- as indeed we are.

Second, at worst, these raids could

touch off a U-2 shootdown and a first class Caribbean crisis. As a matter of

fact, is is probably more likely that autonomous raids will produce a shoot-

down than that they will produce an overthrow of the Castro regime. In this

regard, it can be argued that even without autonomous raids, the odds against

a shootdown are not all that good.

Third, Tom Mann would probably argue that

the continuance of autonomous raids would make more difficult the enforcement

of the warning language in the OAS resolution -- i. e. our own hands should be

clean.

2. Assuming we don't like the status quo (I, for one, do not), there seem to be

the following courses of action open to us.

(a) We can make

a real effort to stop the raids. While CIA says this can't

be done, this may not be true. For example, the cessation of assistance, in- .

creased U.S. surveillance of the Caribbean, and pressure on Nicaragua and

Costa Rica would probably do the trick.

But this is a drastic step and would lead to angry charges in the U.S. and else-

where that we are lending positive support to Castro. It is probably a step we

would not want to take unless it became clear that these exile raids, which are

out of our control, were propelling us to the brink.

(b) We can search harder for an alternative to the U-2. With Castro's

shootdown capability removed, the raids would probably be somewhat more

tolerable -- though still troublesome between now and November. (State and DOD

are still looking into the possibilities of alternatives to the U-2. Preliminary

reports, however, are not particularly hopeful.)

-2-

(c) Using our support as leverage,'

we can try to discourage the exile

groups from making raids of the higher noise-level variety -- e.g. externally-

mounted raids are bad but internally-mounted raids, which smack less of U.S.

involvement, are O.K.

÷ (d) We can cut off all U.S. ties with these exile groups -- e.g. money, equip-

ment, intelligence information. The exile grapevine is reportedly a sensitive

one and the word would get around that we are really not involved. Hopefully,

the word will also reach Castro, and if further raids occur (as CLA says they

will), he will keep his eye focussed on the exiles and not on us.

In cutting off support, we can take the line with the autonomous groups that we

have been disappointed with such things as highly colored press conferences;

misinformation about intentions (Artime told us he was going to attack one place

and he attacked another); and indiscreet conversations (Ray with Tad Szulc).

After due consideration we have decided in favor of a "hands-off" policy. We

wish the exiles well, but they are on their own from here on in.

One argument against this course of action is that Artime and Ray will blab to

the world that they had been getting support from the U.S. This might not be an

insuperable obstacle -- e. g. we survived a similar and more potent situation in

1963 when we cut off the CRC's water.

ni

John Crimmins

tells me that the Special Group may be faced with some

decisions this afternoon. Manolo Ray recently asked the U.S. Government for

three things -- (a) a special grant, (b) our influence with the Puerto Ricans in

getting them to allow Ray to move a boat from Puerto Rico, and (c) our assistance

in getting the Dominican Republic to allow Ray to establish a base in that country.

1 0 one to chang tie same a tel, i en inval o eating revercine

party, seems another story, however.

We might not want to tie our hands in this

way until we are certain that we are not going to change from our present course.

met with the Attorney General for what he identified as a preliminary

meeting.

In regard to Major Oliva, The Committee had reached the

was the person with the most

prestige and influence who would be likely to dissuade subject from

seeking support at this time for large scale, high noise level operations

against Cuba. When this proposal was made to

the Attorney General he

indicated his hight regard

for the Major and stated that he was not

willing to reject tably?

ôvertures unless alternatives were offered. It was

pointed out that since Oliva was an activist and a man of strong purpose,

he was Not likely to accept alternatives. The Attorney General stated

that he would be willing to discuss the matter at a forthcoming 303

Committee meeting.

In regard to the memorandum to the DCI concerning alleged

underworld connections with Cuban exile groups for the purpose of

assassinating key figures in the §stro regime,

it was pointed out that

these reports, in effect, put the United States Government on notice

that such plotting was afoot, and failure to take preventive action

could be construed as condonation. The Coumittee"s finding that this

was assentially a law enforcement problem was cited. The Attorney General

indicated that the Department of Justice would look into the matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Honorable McGeorge Bundy

Special Assistant to the President for

National Security Affairs

SUBJECT:

Status of FBI Investigation re Plans

by Cuban Exiles to Assassinate Cuban

Government Leaders

1. This memorandum is for your information in response

to a 303 Committee query of 30 July 1964 regarding the status of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation of reported plans by

Cuban exiles to assassinate Cuban government leaders.

2. The following is a summary of the investigation to date.

3. Subsequent to CIA's dissemination of information regarding

"Plans of Cuban Exiles to Assassinate Selected Cuban Government

Leaders" (report disseminated by CIA to the 303 Committee and selected

key officials as CSDB-3/661, 653 dated 10 June 1964), the Federal Bureau

of Investigation has interviewed all of the people involved in the plot

except Byron Cameron. Cameron is now in Mexico on a business trip;

he may possibly return to Miami on 7 August at which time the FBI plans

to interview him regarding the plan. The FBI has not decided if it will

interview CIA's other source or if it will re-interview all of the people

involved in the plan.

4. The FBI, as a result of its investigation, has disseminated

a total of seven (7) reports regarding this matter. A summary of these

reports follow:

a. Teofilo Babun Selman specifically denied to the FBI that he

had any involvement in, or knowledge of, any plan to assassinate selected

Cuban government officials. He admitted contact with Julio Lobo

Olavarria, but denied discussing the plan with him and stated that

Eduardo Garcia Molina was present during the meeting with Lobo and

that Garcia could verify his statements.

b. Eduardo Garcia Molina advised the FBI that he knew

of the plan and that he was present when Babun discussed it with Lobo.

c. Julio Lobo Olavarria advised the FBI that Babun had told

him of the plan and of Byron Cameron. Babun had asked him to con-

tribute funds for the plan and he tentatively agreed to furnish funds,

but later declined. Lobo also told the FBI that he had discussed the

plan with CIA.

d. Jose M. "Pepin" Bosch informed the FBI that he had

heard of the plan in general terms and that he had reported it to the

CIA. He denied that he had agreed to furnish funds for the plan.

e.

Eliseo Gomez Fernandez informed the FBl that he had no

knowledge of the plan.

f. Ceferino Oscar Fernandez Veiga informed the FBI that he

had no knowledge of the plan.

g. Major John Doherty of the St. Louis, Missouri, City Police

Department advised the FBI that he is now in charge of the Field

Operations Division of the St. Louis Police Department and formerly

was connected with the Vice Squad of this department. Doherty stated

that he had no idea as to who would be involved with the Mafia and who

would be in a position to participate in plans to carry out executions of

Cuban government officials.

h. All other people interviewed by the FBI denied knowledge

of the plan.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Cuba - Miscellaneous

John Crimmins, Des Fitzgerald, Joe Califano, and I met to talk about miscel-

laneous Cuban problems. Here are some of the items which came up.

1. Aranzazu Incident - John Crimmins said that we have completed our

"investigation" of the Aranzazu incident and that the Spanish have now asked

us to give them our evaluation of the various reports we have furnished to

John is now working on a paper of talking points he will use with the

Spanish (he wants to keep it oral if possible). The general pitch he will

probably want to use will take into account such facts as (a) that we want to

give the Spanish the minimum necessary to keep them from thinking that we

are trying to deceive them and (b) that the Spanish, themselves, probably

evaluate Artime as the prime suspect. Specifically, such points as the

following might be made to the Spanish: First, while we cannot rule out

the possibility that the Cubans sunk the Aranzazu, it is probably more likely

that the exiles did it.

Second, there are a number of exile groups that have

the capability of doing the job. Third, the most likely of the exile groups is

probably Artime. But the fact that Artime's boat was in Curacao would seem

to rule him out; and even if this could be explained, we could still not prove

that Artime is the culprit. Fourth, (if pressed) by a process of elimination,

the attack would seem to have come from the Dominican Republic (the Spanish

already strongly suspect this - see attached cable). In any event, we are sure

it did not come from the U.S.

John Crimmins plans to clear his talking points with the Special Group before

he talks to the Spanish.

Special Group Items - Des mentioned that a dissident group of Army people

inside Cuba have contacted Artime's people; reportedly, they have picked

Artime because they feel that anyone with his resources must have the support

of the U.S. Government. Des feels that we should let this contact develop and,

in this connection, he believes that the Special Group should permit the con-

tinuance of our support to Artime for another 60 or 90 days and, if absolutely

necessary, allow Artime to make one more attack (more or less controlled

by CIA) on Cuba. If we drop Artime precipitously, the dissident group in

Mr. Bundy

November 10, 1964

Cuba will assume that Artime is not worth contacting and their willingness to

express dissidence may tend to dry up. In all of this discussion, Des emphasized

that he is no great admirer of Artime and that the above is not an Agency device

to keep Artime's group alive. This item will probably come before the Special

Group on Thursday.

Des

also mentioned the possibility of passing on to Dorticos, in an unattributable,

deniable fashion, the message that, while the U.S. cannot live with Fidel Castro,

it might well be able to live with Dorticos. Des feels that Cuba is in terrible

shape, that Dorticos knows it, and that a move like this could conceivably

produce a big dividend. At best, it will start Dorticos plotting; at worst,

(if Castro finds out) it will help to sow some seeds of dissension and distrust.

This item will probably come up at a later Special Group meeting.

3. Erosion of Cuban Economy - Des was very hopeful that Cuba will be in

very bad economic shape by the end of 1965. To this end, CIA has arranged

to have shipments of faulty additives sent to Cuba; some of this is going in

already, and some is on the way. Emphasizing the extreme sensitivity of

the operation, Des said that the effect on large amounts of Cuban machinery

could be brutal.

The point was made that there was, these days, a general recognition by the

European missions in Cuba that the Cuban economic situation is grim and

that, in fact, the isolation policy is not entirely a farce. To some extent,

this realization coincided with the timing of the recent Cuban restrictions on

credit.

4.

British Channel to Castro - John Crimmins said that Patrick Gordon-Walker,

in his meeting with Secretary Rusk, suggested that the British would be pleased

to act as a middle man for a dialogue between the U.S. and Cuba. The Secretary

has asked John to look into the desirability of this. The initial feeling of the

group was that it was not a good idea.

Among other things, if we want to

establish a dialogue with Castro, there are better channels than the British.

5. Basic Review of Cuban Policy - The group agreed that, with November 3

behind us, we can usefully do some basic review work on Cuba. To this end,

John Crimmins agreed to write a paper which would outline the major problems

and the possible options, including accommodation. This will be ready in a

few days' time and will be distributed for comment. We can then decide where

to go from there.

Des Fitzgerald said we should consider the re-institution, in the near future,

of the "unilateral" CLA-directed covert program which had scored a number

of hits last year. The group agreed, however, that a decision on this should

probably wait until some of the basic review work on Cuba had been completed.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Policy Toward Cuba

In the attached paper the ICS recommended to the SecDef that

he forward the Army study entitled, "Square Dance" to the Inter-

departmental Coordinating Committee for Cuban Affairs for appropriate

interagency coordination as a basis for further consideration by the

JCS.

In the course of preparing a Chairman's position on "Square

Dance," I pointed out that the covert operations proposed would involve

serious injury to Cuban civilians, and probably

should not be elected

without very serious provocation -- perhaps greater than that required

to justify invasion. In addition, even if consistent with US values on

"just" international behavior, it is highly unlikely that we could under-

take such operations without having our role discovered and resulting

serious international liabilities.

Finally, even if "Square Dance"

were successfully implemented, there would be no guarantee that the

Cuban government would change its position. More likely, Soviet aid

and control would be increased.

As you are aware, Bill Smith participated in this study, though I

understand he did not subscribe to all of its contents.

I recommend,

however, that the White House remain aloof from formal consideration

of "Square Dance" at this stage.

Then if the Coordinating Committee

and the JCS should recommend action in accordance with study proposals,

we can consider their recommendations without any precommitment.

outline program which would undermine Castro's economy,

deprive him of convertible currency, and cause

political

instability in cuba through covert

attacks against cuba's

sugar industry coupled with US stabilization actions on the

world sugar market. Basically, the proposal

envisions a

three- to six-year program, beginning with a 30 per cent

reduction of anticipated 1966. Cuban sugar production, by

introducing aerially from off-shore, a sugar cane plant

parasite, Bunga.: Subsequently, the economic and political

APPENDIX A

CONSIDERATIONS OF A PROPOSAL TO ATTACK...

COVERTLY THE CUBAN SUGAR INDUSTRY

1. The uitimate success of the proposed program would

depend, in part, upon the effectiveness of the economic

controls for the stabilization of world sugar prices.

It would serve no purpose to reduce Cuba's total annual

production of sugar if a subsequent rise in the price of

sugar could net the Castro regime the same amount of

convertible currency

as it had before the program was

undertaken.

The arguments and rationale in favor of the

economic proposals in the study appear to

have validity.

However, world economics is a

most complex

subject

and

involves many variable factors. The important points on

economic controls should be coordinated with appropriate

agencies in the government having responsibility for such

matters.

2. Assuming that success of the actions of the outline

program can be achieved, it must be acknowledged that this

would not assure the downfall of the Castro Government, or

that

if

it did

fall, a government friendly to the United

States would be installed. Russia has too much

at

stake,

politically, to allow an overthrow of a communist regime

for economic reasons alone.

success of the proposed actions

would, however, create serious difficulties for the Castro

Government

and would be an additional means of exerting

pressure against that

government.

3. There are disadvantages to the program proposed by

the study.

The approval for implementation of such a

concept would introduce a new dimension into cold wai

methods and would require a major change in national

policy.

There is the possibility of retaliation in the

event of discovery. There is also an obvious political

risk associated with this proposal. Should any creaible

evidence of. US involvement ever be obtained, the political

lOSS

to the United States

would

be great. Quite apart

from the propaganda impact of

such

discovery,

the influence

of the United. States in international organizations such

as the United Nations and the Organization of American

States would be impaired

seriously.

4. Nevertheless; it is the responsibility of the Joint

Chiefs of Staff to keep the Secretary of Defense and the

President apprised of the capabilities of

the military

establishment.

The subject study presents measures which

should be

considered, and if found to be acceptable after

coordination with appropriate government agencies it would

represent another option for positive actions

against the

Castro regime.

5. NSAM 213* dated & January 1963, established a

committee to coordinate the management of all aspects

of US policy toward Cuba. The President looks to the

Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee for Cuban Affairs

fos the effective coordination of the execution of policy

decisions and for timely recommendations on new courses

of action.

The subject study should be referred to

this

committee for the necessary coordination preliminary to

reporting

to the President..

MEMORANDUM FOR THE COORDINATOR,

INTERDEPARTMENTAL

COORDINATING COMMITTEE FOR CUBAN AFFAIRS

Subject: Cuban Actions (U)

1. On 21 March 1964, the Joint Chiefs

of Staff

informed

the President that they would continue to review the problem

of putting additional pressures on Castro and that the

President would be advised it any new

and

promising

courses

of action were uncovered.

2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have forwarded a study on

the feasibility of undermining the Castro regime by attack-

ing

the Cuban sugar industry.

The study examines the world

sugar market

and

the vulnerabilities of Cuba's sugar industry,

and

proposes

a phased interagency program which would:

a. Initially reduce Cuban sugar production by

approximately 30 per cent from the anticipated 1956

production level.

b. Expand US influence in the world sugar market

by assignment of quotas and other actions to insulate

the free market from the effects of Cuban sugar losses.

3. Apart from economic measures, the proposals made in

the study are within existing or attainable military capa-

bilities. Several actions are proposed. Key among these

is the introduction into Cuba of Bunga, a plant parasite

against sugar cane. It appears feasible to introduce

gradually Bunga into Cuba and maintain a basis for plausibly

disavowing US involvement.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Shipments of Contaminating Elements to Cuba

1. I refer to your interest in hearing more about the

Fitzgerald operation which involves the current shipment

of contaminating elements to Cuba and which is aimed at

bringing about a breakdown of a substantial amount of

Cuban machinery.

2. Attached is a copy of a memo which I believe you drafted

for a meeting with the President on April 7, 1964. Item 5

would appear to cover the type of operation which Fitzgerald

is now conducting.

I have not come across any minutes of the April 7 meeting.

(As I recall it, you intentionally kept the attendance restricted

and were the sole attendee from the NSC staff. ) While.I do

not recognize the handwriting or the doodles on the attached

, that Items l through 5 were O.K. and that the only serious

• problems concerned Items 6 and 7.

3. I assume that you still want to hear a status report on the

Fitzgerald operation at the Special Group meeting today and I

will pass this word to both Des and Peter Jessup.

I think this operation is probably too far down the road to stop,

if indeed we do want to stop it. In any event, you will be able

to find this out, by some gentle questioning, when Des gives

" phis status report.

Memorandum for Discussion of Covert Program Against Cuba

U.S. covert operations against the Castro regime have recently

been reviewed in the Special Group (54/12), and a number of

issues are presented which require discussion and decision at a

higher level.

The present covert program is designed in support of a general

policy of intense economic and political isolation of Castro,

accompanied by methods short of war to get rid of the Castro

regime. Parts of the program authorized in July 1963 have in

fact been held up for various reasons, and it is now important to

decide whether or not certain substantial and expensive activities

should be (a) actively continued; (b) held in readiness; (c) reduced,

or (d) abandoned.

Covert programs against Cuba fall into the following categories:

1. Collection of intelligence, to include the infiltration and ex-

filtration of agents and covert supply of agent operations.

it eit

Recommendation: It is unanimously recommended that this pro-

What We gram be continued..

Covert propaganda aimed to encourage low-risk forms of

active and passive resistance and to stimulate tension within the

regime and between Cuba and the Soviet bloc.

Recommendation: It is recommended that these programs be

continued with regular review of their operational guidelines.

3. Cooperation with other agencies in economic denial by selec-

tive economic action with respect to products critical to the Cuban

economy.

Recommendation: It is recommended that this program be con-

tinued:

4. Attempts to identify and establish contact with potential

dissident elements near the power centers of the regime.

Recommendation: It is recommended that this program be con-

tinued.

5. Indirect economic sabotage with a low level of visibility and

detection. Programs of this sort involve possible overseas

sabotage of Cuban ships and possible addition of contaminating

elements to sensitive Cuban imports (not food).

Recommendation: It is recommended that these programs be

continued.

6. CIA-controlled sabotage raiding apparatus in Florida which

conducted five raids in the summer and fall of 1963, before

authority for such raids was suspended for political reasons.

Recommendation: Opinion is divided on this issue and it is recom-

mended that higher authority hear the arguments of different parties.

7. CIA-supported (but not directly controlled) autonomous Cuban

exile groups operating from Central America. These groups will

begin operations soon unless action is taken to try to stop them.

Recommendation: Again opinion is divided and it is recommended

that higher autbority hear the arguments.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Artime

I talked to John Crimmins again about the Artime situation. Here is the

picture up to now.

1. If we decide to try to stop Artime, the most appropriate scenario

appears to be as follows:

(a) A decision to stop him must be made by 9:00 A.M. on Thursday

morning.

(b) Locate the Artime ship by plane tomorrow morning. (It is not

certain that we would be able to find it, but we think we probably

could.)

(c) Send three fast destroyers from Gitmo to the scene.

(d) These destroyers would circle and shadow the Artime ship. John

Crimmins guesses that the chances are 50-50 that this sort of

approach would be successful in deterring Artime; presumably,

he would be afraid that the security of the operation was jeopardized.

2. As for the desirability of interfering with Artime, State, Defense, and

CIA all oppose. The main arguments, in their bare bones, are as follows:

(a) Interference will be interpreted as a case of aiding Castro and, as

such, will probably be very hard to justify to all sorts of audiences

(e.g. Latin America, Congress, the American people). We could

hardly expect Artime to keep it quiet.

(b) The operation would have to take place relatively close to Cuba.

Conceivably, this could bring Cuban forces into the picture.

(c) Artime could use the opportunity to get us involved. To the Cuban

Government, the destroyers might look like cover for Artime and

Artime could use us.

3. All things considered,

it seems to me that the best course is to sweat

this one out (Artime may not make it even if we leave him alone - e. g.

the usual mechanical difficulties), and to work in the future on ways to

stop Artime before he gets so far along in his operation and so close to

Cuba.. If you feel differently, please let me know immediately and I will

crank up a special Special Group meeting for tonight or for 8:00 A.M.

tomorrow morning. (For your information, the knowledgeable people

around town on this one are Vance, Fitzgerald, and Crimmins.)

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Artime's Contact with Dissident Leader

I went to a meeting with John Crimmins and a couple CIA types to hear about a

recent Artime meeting in Europe with a Cuban dissident named Cubela. Here

•are the barebones of the Artime/ Cubela meeting, as reported by Artime to a

ClA agent.

.1. Cubela told Artime that there are three groups in Cuba with which he has

• contact and which are ready to act against Castro. First, there is a group

•which Cubela heads himself. Second, there is a group headed by a man named

del Gado who is a fairly high-level official in the Cuban Government. Third,

and most important, there is a group headed by Frias, the Commander of the

Western Army. This army is the largest in Cuba and consists of roughly

• 75,000 people. At the least, the Frias group seems to include the Deputy

Commander of the Western Army and the Commander of the Artillery of the

Western Army. (We don't know how loyal the Army would be to Frias in the

crunch.)

Cubela told Artime that there are others who are ready to act. One of these is

Machado, the Minister of Health.

2. Cubela and Artime agreed tentatively on the following scenario for removing

Castro:

(a) On D-Day minus 30 days, Artime would try to step up his attacks on the

coast, largely for psychological purposes.

There would not have to be

many attacks to make a large psychological impact since the dissidents

could count on Castro to over-react.

(b) Before D-Day, Artime would infiltrate people into Pinar del Rio to make

a "safe area." What this would amount to is an area to which the dissi-

dents could run in case their attempt at a coup failed.

(c) On D-Day minus 7 days, Artime would himself enter Cuba.

-2-

January 5, 1965

(d) On D-Day there would be a "palace coup'' during which Castro and other

top leaders would be neutralized.

(e) After the coup, a junta would rule the country. The junta would be made

up of 3 internal dissidents, Artime, and 2 lesser-known political prisoners

who are now on the Isle of Pines. Artime would be President of the junta.

(The CIA agent explained that Cubela and other internal dissidents feel

that they need Artime. They have a guilt complex about the fact that

they have been living with Castro for so long without apparently doing

anything about it; they feel that, with Artime, the U.S. would accept the

new regime.)

3. Artime said that he would be meeting in Europe again with Cubela in about a

month to discuss the plan further.

4. As for the timing of D-Day, Artime said he was thinking of March 13 (Fidel

will be speaking at the University on that day), which is an important historical

date for the group (the DR) which Cubela represents; he says he has not yet

suggested that date

to Cubela.

CIA will be sending over to us a more detailed paper regarding the Artime/ Cubela

conversation on Wednesday. Also, the subject will be discussed at the Special

Group meeting on Thursday since, among other things, it has an obvious bearing

on the decision of whether or not to cut off Artime's water immediately because

of the raid he is now threatening to make.

It is pertinent to note that Cubela is not an unknown quantity to CLA. They have

been dealing with him for three years; to the best of CIA's knowledge, he has

never given them bad information. At the same time, CIA at this point is loath

to make a hard evaluation of the Artime/ Cubela plot. (I think this is fair in view

of the fact that we really don't know much about the plot; indeed, it may be that

Artime and Cubela don't know the answers to a lot of hard questions - e. g. How

much muscle could the Commander of the Western Army really muster?)

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Caribbean and Other

Here are a few items which came up while you were away and which you may

want to know about.

1. BG - Greenwood's New Look - Attached at Tab l is a cable from BG reporting

on Greenwood's recent trip to BG. It is a pleasant thing to read in that it tells

V about Greenwood's growing disenchantment with Cheddi and growing admiration

for Burnahm. Even divided by half, it sounds good.

2. BG Rice and our Covert Help - In order to help BG get rid of its rice export

bottleneck which is causing serious difficulties for Burnham, we are in the midst

of working out a deal whereby BG can sell some rice to Latin America. It is

going to cost us $200, 000 to break the bottleneck - i.e., to pay the difference

between what BG has gotten from Cuba in the past and what Latin America is

willing to pay now. Needless to say, this is all quite covert.

3. Cecil King - As of possible interest, attached at Tab 2 is a cable reporting

V Del Carlson's conversation with Cecil King. King mentions a talk with Bill

Tyler and you; he also makes a strong pitch in favor of a PPP/PNC coalition.

4. Secretary Rusk and Policy - The Secretary recently told John Crimmins

I that he wants no new initiatives on Cuba policy for the time being. Apparently,

he wants to keep the temperature low while we are sorting out our Vietnam

problem.

5. Cuban Deals with Spain and Morocco - Cuba recently concluded long-term

, sugar agreements with Spain and Morocco. The Spanish are willing to buy sugar

at a higher price than the Russians are willing to pay (so they can sell ships),

and this especially bugs us. Some details on these two deals are at Tab 3.

6. Covert Program - You are likely to be faced with a full Cuba menu at your

next Special Group meeting. First, State will probably want to cut off Artime's

water and stay as far away as possible from any internal Cuban dissidents; CLA

" may feel differently. Second, there may be some discussion of whether or not

on the shelf. CIA will probably say "no" (fish or cut bait) and State will

probably say "yes" (with world scene hotting up, it may be good to have this

capability in reserve). Third, State, CIA, and DOD may ask permission to

offer some low-risk assistance to the new exile group, RECE (Oliva and Freyre).

I am against but thus far I seem to be alone. My memo to John Crimmins on

the subject is attached at Tab 4.

7. Communications Security Survey - The BOB study group has finished with

the Ranch and has completed about 2/3 of the Washington portion of its work.

The balance should go fairly quickly in view of the fact that we recently blasted

loose the information which the group needed on the telephone system at the

• White House and EOB. The group will probably not examine the emergency

locations. There is not much there that they can usefully do and it does not

seem worth the time and effort to override Ted Clifton's objections; besides,

this less urgent task can be done at some future date.

• The group is running behind schedule (report due on March 1). They asked for

another month, and I gave it to them; I'm fairly confident they will meet the

new deadline.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Special Group Meeting - Cuba

Here is some miscellaneous information with regard to your Special Group

meeting this afternoon on Cuba.

1. Artime Cut-off - As you know, State is pressing to cut off Artime, largely

because of his recent irresponsible activity. CIA opposes State on this one

for the usual reasons. DOD, reportedly, will also take a somewhat reluc-

tant line on cutting off Artime. Vance may express the view that a cutoff

will drive Artime up the wall and that he will go off and do something that

could cause us

real trouble vis-a-vis our present conflict with the East.

For example, he might go off and sink a Soviet ship. DOD would probably

prefer that we phase him out slowly and keep a dialogue going over the course

of the next few months. The advantage of this would be twofold - First, it

would keep Artime quiet; second, his residual power to hurt us, when we

finally do cut him off, will be reduced.

On this one, I am inclined towards the DOD view.

2. Pesticides - The CIA will probably propose a deal whereby we arrange

to have diluted Cuban pesticides.

State and DOD are both likely to oppose this

one for such reasons as the following: First, it will mean going to the Dutch

Government; it is questionable whether we want to bring up such a proposal

with that government, especially if we think the odds are high that we will be

turned down. Second, there is the moral issue of whether or not we should

dilute pesticides which were given to the Cubans during the prisoner exchange.

Third, it would be highly embarrassing if this one ever leaked out from one of

the many bases that would have to be touched.

I don't like this one either.

3. Support to RECE - One question which will arise today is whether or not to

start giving some low-risk support to RECE. While State and DOD, at the

working levels, originally were in favor of it, they seem to have changed their

position. One reason - some of the arguments which are spelled out in the

attached memo on the subject. Another reason - State does not want to com-

promise its position on Artime (i. e., If you give aid to RECE, how can you stop

aid to Artime?).

State and DOD will probably propose that, in turning down RECE, we give

them $17,000. The RECE people apparently had to tap a program fund of

its small contributors to keep going administratively over the last couple

months when Bosch cut them off; they want to return this money to the

small contributors. Arguments in favor of giving them the money are:

(a) it will lessen the shock of giving RECE a negative reply, (b) they will

not look bad among the exiles (we don't want them to look bad because they

are "good guys"), and (c) part of RECE's problem has not been their fault.

We have not been able to give RECE as prompt an answer as we would have

liked.

I continue to be in favor of not getting involved with RECE; I agree that

$17,000 is a small price to pay for a kiss-off.

4. Keating Gimmick - Both DOD and State are cold to the idea of having

Keating (I understand this now may be changed to Donovan) stir up trouble

between the Soviets and the Cubans. DOD feels that such goings-on might

be interpreted as some sort of Vietnam play. State feels that such a man

wouldn't get received at a high level; also, there are other ways to do the

job if it needs doing.

While I admire CIA's ingenuity and I sincerely think we should keep them

invention-minded, I must say that this one sounds like a Rube Goldberg con-

traption. I am against it.

5. CIA's Paramilitary Capability - Both DOD and State will probably oppose

CIA's proposal to drop its paramilitary capability. I agree with State and DOD

that, with the present world situation as it stands, this is a good capability

to keep on hand if we possibly can. I would agree to an abandonment of this

capability only if it were demonstrated that we could crank it up again in a

very short space of time.

Summary Statement of U.S. Policy Toward Cuba

Present Policy and Courses of Action: Our ultimate objective

has been to replace the Castro regime.

The immediate objectives

have been (a) to reduce the will and ability of the Soviet-supported

regime to organize Latin America in a form inimical to our interests

and (b) to prevent the use of Cuba as an offensive base.

In practi-

cal terms, we have been (a) trying to maintain pressure in order to

exacerbate Cuban internal economic and political conditions; (b) try-

ing to strengthen the Latin American ability to withstand subversion;

and (c) hoping for the breaks that might produce a major change which

would serve both the immediate and ultimate objectives.

Our principal pressures have been economic (the economic denial ef-

fort) and paramilitary (externally mounted hit-and-run sabotage and

harassment actions, either directly under Agency control of through

"autonomous" groups). Both kinds of pressures have been exerted only

partially. The application of some economic denial measures has been

inhibited, and the introduction of others ruled out, by the judgment

that the risks of incurring political costs in our relations with

allies outweighed the advantages to our Cuban policy. Similarly, the

paramilitary program involving CIA-controlled actions was set aside

even before it really started, and the program of the

"autonomous"

groups was abandoned after a reasonable trial, because of the decision

_hat the damage to our broad interests, especially our relations with

the USSR and the Vietnamese situation, would be disproportionate to

benefits which we might obtain in terms of our Cuban policy. (In the

case of the

"autonomous" groups, moreover, there were, in practice,

very limited benefits.) The overflights issue has also been a major

factor in the calculation. These judgments have been influenced by

the belief that developments in Cuba and Latin America were moving,

even though slowly, in the right direction.

With respect to Cuba, this belief seems no longer to be warranted.

According to very recent estimates, the Cuban economy improved in

1964 and will probably continue to

move upward in 1965, principally

because of increased sugar production. The economy is probably now.

back at or close to the pre-Castro level.

Our economic denial pro-

gram, limited by broad political considerations,

has had only partial

effects. In 1964, when Cuba was flush with foreign exchange, we were

unable to prevent

its acquisition of Western goods up to the limits

of its exchange availabilities. In 1965, Cuban imports from the Free

World will almost certainly be sharply down as a result, not of the

denial program, but rather of exchange stringencies brought about by

the very low world price of sugar.

It is certainly true that we have

orevented sales of critical comnodities, that we have persuaded the

ajor Western powers to withhold further official credit facilities

on the basis that Cuba was not credit-worthy and that we have ham-

pered the development of the economy. But it has been a constant,

scrambling struggle to do even this, and there are very recent re-

ports that the British and the French are considering granting large

amounts ($50 million each) of credits. Moreover, we have always

been faced with the possibility that the Soviets will simply make

additional foreign exchange available to Cuba. The large (6 million

tons) sugar crOP,

the signs of economic revival in Cuba, the con-

tinued Soviet assistance, and the general lack of sympathy with our

economic denial efforts indicate that the program, as constituted at

present, will become more and more difficult to carry out and less

and less effective. With the decrease in external economic pressures,

the prospects for continued economic progress become brighter, even

though the economy will probably continue to be far from healthy for

the next one or two years.

With respect to the internal political situation, the regime is sub-

ject to some stresses, but its control is firm.

Morale among anti-

Castro elements is low because of the efficiency of the security

apparatus and the apparent permanence of the regime.

Externally, frictions between Castro and the Soviets and the Chinese

exist and are potentially helpful. The cormunity of interest is so

great, however, as to override current difficulties. In the sub-

version sector, Cuba, with Soviet acquiescence, if not encouragement,

has been trying to step up the pace.

At least

in the short term, the

Dominican crisis probably has improved the atmosphere in Latin

America for general Communist subversion. In spite of his uneasiness

about our intervention in the Dominican Republic as an augury for

himself, Castro almost certainly will try to capitalize on the situ-

ation and to intensify subversive efforts.

We have three gross options: (a) to continue our present programs;

(b) to increase pressures; or (c) to adopt a "softer" line.

a. A continuation of our present policy will probably mean that,

barring some fortuitous development, we will progressively lose

ground in terms of our objectives.' We will, however, incur rela-

tively few risks with respect to other national objectives.

b. On the assumption that we do not intend to resort to military

action, we can increase pressure by either taking additional eco-

nomic measures or returning to paramilitary activities. The ex-

vanded economic program could include (1) putting foreign firms

rading with Cuba on a US proclaimed list, thus prohibiting business

transactions in the United States (high political costs in our re-

lations with our allies and limited effectiveness); (2) formally de-

nying US Government contracts to foreign firms trading with Cuba

(moderate political costs and potentially moderate effectiveness) ;

(3) vigorously applying the Cuban Assets Control Regulations in areas

hitherto considered politically sensitive (moderate political costs

and quite limited effectiveness); and (4) financially assisting Free-

World sugar producers to compete with Cuba (small political costs,

high financial costs and noderate effectiveness). In the paramilitary

field, the Agency could undertake a variety of actions involving sabo-

tage and harassment designed

to inflict economic and psychological

damage and to create political tensions. These measures would be

effective only if vigorously and continuously executed. They would

involve serious political risks, particularly in our relations with

the USSR.

c. The adoption of a "softer" line would entail a fundamental

change in policy toward accommodation. Basically, it would involve

the acceptance of a Communist state in Latin America, with a strong

effort being made to curb its aggressive tendencies, probably in

favor of a

"Titoist" orientation.

The chances are better than even

that the choice of this option would be seriously damaging to our

long-term interests, particularly in Latin America.

********

* **

There is a fourth, very broad choice:

The cessation of Soviet

sup-

port of Castro as part of a global settlement of outstanding

US-USSR issues. The analysis of this option is beyond the scope

of this summary statement.

MEMORANDUM BOR THE PRESIDENT

The noise level of Castro's charges of "threatened Yankee aggression" may

go up as a result of two incidents which have occurred during the past

36 hours.

On Saturday night a CLA exfiltration mission ran into an

ambush. The two Cuban agents being exfiltrated were captured. Two

members of the exfiltration team, who went in to pick them up, were

killed. The Havana radio is broadcasting stories on this incident. If

past performance is any guide, the captured agents will spill the full

story of their involvement. Castro can be expected to relate this incident

to Guantanamo as further evidence of U.S. aggressive intentions.

2.

From commint we

learned of action by Cuban air and naval units

against unidentified surface vessels off the northwestern coast of Cuba

shortly after midnight this morning. The evidence is fragmentary. The

Cubans appear to have intercepted a launch, set it on fire, and picked up

two of the persons aboard. CLA assures me that none of their units were

involved. They speculate that the boat may have belonged to Cuban exile

free-lancers. Nothing has come out publicly on this incident yet.

NOTE FOR WALT ROSTOW

SUBJECT:

Cuba

DocId: 32423484 Page 215

Last Friday I had a most interesting talk with CIA's new man on Cuba.

He is

Dave Phillips -- one of their more sophisticated operators who

performed so well in the DR following the 1965 revolt.

Dave is revamping the Cuban operation. The apparatus mounted

following the Bay of Pigs is obsolete.

It was aimed at stimulating

Castro's overthrow from the outside with propaganda, infiltrators,

supplies, etc. For this purpose they had a large and not well-

camouflaged establishment in Miami.

The Miami operation is being

phased out.

The sizeable sea-borne infiltration-exfiltration capability

is being dismantled and a small, more efficient one established for

stand-by use. Radio Americas on the Swan Islands is being discon-

tinued.

The new emphasis is on developing contacts within Castro's inner

circle.

We need to know more about who his main advisers are and

what they are thinking. If there is to be a change in Cuba, it is more

likely to come from defections in

this group. If Castro were to start

looking for accommodation, one of them would be the first to know

and probably the channel for feelers.

Dave agrees that Castro finds himself increasingly hemmed in. The

loss of "Che" and the insurgency effort in Bolivia on the heels of the

big LASO splash has been a serious blow. The outlook for the sugar

crop this year is not good: only 5-5. 5 million tons. Cuba is committed

to deliver 5 million to the USSR alone. Relations with the Soviets are

probably the testiest since the missile crisis, as reflected by Cuba's

actions during the 50th anniversary ceremonies.

All this makes it most important that we:

_ develop our intelligence on what is going on inside the regime.

-- be alert to indications that Castro is looking for accommodation

or his disillusioned lieutenants want to know where we stand if

they move to dump him.

I am happy to

see as politically sensitive an operator as Dave Phillips

on the Cuban job at this time.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The President

I. On 7 June 1968, Guantanamo Naval Base reported that

according to a clandestine source, a group of about thirty of-

ficers and men from a nearby Cuban tank unit are planning to

seize six or seven tanks, assault the communications facility and

armory at the camp, and speed to the Guantanamo Naval Base seek-

ing asylum. Along the way, they will fire against any resistance.

The Base sent the informant back to the conspirators with the

message that the United States does not endorse the plan, will

not support it, and recommends that it not be attempted. Further,

that if the operation is undertaken, the United States must have

more advance notice than the forty-eight hours cited, and that

the group must stop their tanks outside the fence surrounding the

Base• The Guantanamo Naval Base considers the exfiltration plan

feasible if security is maintained until execution time, but

estimates that there is only a fifty-fifty chance of this.

2. Germane to the Guantanamo report is a CIA dissemina-

tion of 4 June. According to several sources, Carlos Prio, former

President of Cuba, is sponsoring a plan to assassinate Fidel

Castro. This developed after two Cubans exPiltrated Cuba via

Guantanamo on 16 April with a message from dissident Cuban mili-

tary officers at the tank and artillery battalions near Guantanamo.

They offered to eliminate Castro and proclaim Prio as President;

Prio in return agreed to recognize the Cuban Armed Forces as the

sole security force in Cuba. Two Cubans have now infiltrated Cuba

from Miami to implement the assassination. At last report -

6 June - they were in Havana. (CIA has nothing whatever to do

with these attempts and learns of them only through penetration of

Cuban exile groups.)

3. Not related but relevant, CIA recently evoked a radio

response from Manuel Pineiro, Chief of Cuban Intelligence, to a

clandestine broadcast to him. The purpose was to provide him a

private communications channel, should he be or becone disaffected.

The possibility that Fidel Castro approved of the contact should

not be discounted. Discussions are being held with the Department

of State on this development.

MR. PRESIDENT:

I discreetly checked with Nick Katzenbach about whether Senator

Mansfield or "anyone at State" was doing anything to get closer to Castro

at this time. Nick responded promptly and as follows:

-- he knows nothing about Senator Mansfield's activities in this field;

-- he himself has taken only one step with respect to Castro:

two men came to our base at Guantanamo; told our people that

they planned to assassinate Castro; and they left to return to Cuba.

CLA, Defense, and State agreed that, should an assassination or

an assassination attempt take place, the U. S. skirts should be clean.

Therefore, Nick empowered State to inform the Swiss that they might

tell Cuban authorities that there had been recent reports coming to

us of a Castro assassination attempt.

Nick says that exhausts his policy connection with Cuban matters.

25. There is no doubt that Castro's popularity

and the morale of the civilian population have de-

clined somewhat this year and that there have been

various, isolated acts of opposition and sabotage.

But no evidence exists of an organized anti-Castro

effort anywhere in Cuba.

Moreover, there is no evi-

dence of unusual activity or vigilance by Cuban mili-

tary and security forces.

Persistent rumors among

refugees that Major Armando Acosta, Major Calixto

Garcia, and others are leading antiregime groups in

the Sierra Maestra have proved to be the merest gossip.

On 6 November, Garcia appeared at a public function

in Havana and

Acosta also seems to be in Castro's

favor.

There have been no indications, moreover, that

regime officials who are

certainly aware of the rumors

spreading through the exile community are concerned

about possible armed or organized opposition.

26.

It is possible that a handful of disaf-

fected Cubans have fled to remote areas of eastern

Cuba in an attempt to escape the totalitarian con-

trols of the regime.

They may be escaped prisoners,

army deserters, bandits, and brigands. It is also

possible that a few exile infiltrators may have

landed in Cuba.

Such individuals, however, do not

constitute a

threat to the regime. Privately owned

weapons have been very scarce in Cuba since the re-

gime conducted several campaiyns to confiscate them.

It is possible--as some refugee reports have al-

leged--that individuals or small groups may have at-

tempted attacks on small military outposts in the

hinterlands.

If that is true, or if army deserters

were able to bring weapons and ammunition with them,

there may be a few armed men in the hills.

27.

In any case, the military and security

forces could easily isolate and quickly exterminate

such individuals.

The Interior Ministry's Mountain

Troops, which were successful by early 1965 in

eliminating a few counterrevolutionary bands from

the hills of eastern and central Cuba, have apparently.

increased their capabilities during recent years.

100 air force helicopters to locate counterrevolu-

element that posed even a temporary or isolated

threat to the regime could long survive. It is

likely, moreover, that as long as the military and

security forces remain loyal to Castro, he can

deal with threats to his position from

any other

internal source or combination of internal forces.

Conclusion

28.

As Castro's dictatorship has become more

totalitarian, civilian morale and economic condi-

tions have deteriorated somewhat but there is no

evidence of organized opposition anywhere in Cuba.

It is difficult to gauge the extent of Castro's

popularity; it seems, however, that regardless of

the course he follows, he will retain the hard-core

support of the peasants, many students and youths,

and leading members of the party and mass organiza-

tions.

By ceding greater power to his followers in

the military and security forces, Castro has granted

supreme institutional power to the group that is

most loyal to him.

These forces are large and ef-

ficient and can probably contain any internal threat

to Castro in the foreseeable future.

29 .

Thus his rule is contingent only on the

continued loyalty of his military entourage. Any

threat to him from this group would also have to

be against his brother Raul. It is extremely un-

likely, however, that Raul would take part in any

move against Fidel. If however, a significant num-

ber of majors were to become convinced that Fidel

were either mentally or physically unable to rule

and that Raul could not be separated from his

brother, they could conceivably attempt to limit

Fidel's power. At 42, however, Fidel is in robust

good health.

30 .

Castro has at times vaguely discussed

the possibility of reducing his role at the top,

and there have been occasional reports that he may

eventually step down as prime minister.

He might

resort to such a gesture if

major economic plans

failed disastrously or if civilian morale and

economic conditions worsened considerably. It prob-

ably would be only a ploy, however, similar to his

resignation as prime minister in July 1959, when

for a few hours he was technically out of office

while the Cuban President was forced to resign.

In any case, there is little chance either that

Castro will

voluntarily relinguish any significant

part of his absolute power in Cuba or that a plot

against the regime could succeed in the foresee-

able future.
