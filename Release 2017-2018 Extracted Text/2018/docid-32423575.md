Moody explained that the term "watch list" was some-

years.

She said

term

"watch list" was in 1961, and it was in relation to

looking for names of people, reports of meetings, or some

other kind of activity. She recalls, in the early 1960s,

the names of subversives and agents, particularly Soviet,

that CIA had sent to NSA. She has no recollection of any

U.S. citizens being on the watch list in the early 1960s.

In fact, she says that at that time, she was working on

the military aspect of the Cuban problem, and did not keep

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

The Director and Deputy Director were aware of the

early watch list activity. Moody stated that because the

naterial was so sensitive, and the officers in the Agency

were concerned for the

"perishable nature" of the SIGINI

product, the Director and Deputy Director took a major

role in

the activity. When names of American citizens were

put on the watch list, Moody is sure that the Director and

Deputy Director did know of this activity.

General Counsel, Moody was not sure about his knowledge.

Moody has no personal recollection of names coming in

from the Office of Security.

laced mostly with the other agency users and would not

have had responsibility for communications with the Office

of Security.

19 or men cations at the rica

Asked about the submission of names by telephone,

Moody stated that this may have happened before the for-

malization of the procedure in 1969; after 1969, any name

coming in by telephone would have to be followed by written

authorization from the requesting agency.

The Yarborough cable of October 1967 signaled the

first time that U.S. citizens and groups associated with

black and antiwar movements were expressly put on the

watch list.

She does recall the Yarborough cable coming

in on a weekend and the reply from General Carter the next

week.

FILE:

At the time the cable came in, Moody discussed it

with a Colonel William Hamilton.

Hamilton questioned the

legality and propriety of the task requested by Yarborough.

Moody and Hamilton then decided not to implement the re-

quest until the Director approved it, which he did before

authorizing a reply.

Moody recognized her initials on the Carter response

and the date of June 19, 1969.

She could not recall why

any meetings

or discussions with anybody in the Defense Department,

ClA, or fBl about the Yarborough cable.

In fact,

she

said

she never talked to Yarborough about anything.

She was

under the impression, however,

that there was a Presidential

order to the Secretary of Defense to keep track of civil

disturbances, and the Secretary of Defense had tasked the

Army to do that

that she was quite sure that the telegram was sent to

Yarborough and to the other individuals on the U.s.

Intelligence Board.

She cannot recall any meetings or

communications during that time between Carter and

Yarborough regarding civil disturbances).

Moody could not recall anything being included on the

watch list directly as a result of Yarborough's telegram.

She did not know of any names of people or organizations

that came along with the Yarborough cable. In addition,

she could not recall any specific response other than the

Carter memorandum to Yarborough's telegram; she recalled

no SIGINT every being supplied.

Moody does not recall

any meetings within NSA that resulted from the Yarborough

cable.

Moody stated that it was during this mid-late 1960s

period that NSA began to develop a fairly sophisticated

computer capability to do dictionary scans.

he initia

she said that it took many years to develop the capability

to the point where the computers could scan a large num-

ber of messages.

Moody recalls that names began to come in to the P

Group from the FBI, CIA, Secret Service, and possibly

from the military services and DIA.

She does not recall

any names of individuals from the Army ACS(I) or from

the State Department, although Ambassador Höffacker was

Chairman of the Terrorism Committee and may have submitted

names that related to it. As for the Bureau of Narcotics

Dangerous Drugs, their submissions did not start

coming in until about 1970, and then with assurances from

Director Ingersoll that the material would not be used

to prosecute drug traffickers.

Moody stated that NSA

does not have "any law enforcement function."

She did

concede, however, that NSA could have intercepted com-

munications which could have been used in apprehending

drug traffickers.

Moody stated emphatically that there

were never any names sent from state or local police, and,

had there been, NSA would not have accepted them. This

would have been a clear law enforcement function.

When asked about the 4-page, roughly-typed document:

Moody said that she did not author it, but speculated

that there were two people in her office who may have --

She recognized the lan-

guage in it, but could not pinpoint where the list of

names and organizations had come from.

When questioned about project MINARET and the reasons FILE:

for it, Moody stated that she sensed the sensitivity of

the project and was attempting to control: access to the

perishable SIGINT information.

In a sense, she was "pro-

tecting the need to know."

The charter was probably pre-

pared within her office, but she cannot recall preparing

it herself.

It was approved by the Director, as were all

materials relating to the watch list.

She stated

that "Gayler was informed on a day-to-day basis about

the watch list activities."

She stated that she even

took a specially-colored folder containing watch list

product to Gayler every day.

In addition, MINARET was discussed with and approved

by the Secretary of Defense.

with regard to monitoring U.S. dissidents.

Moody does

not recall any questioning about the legality of the

monitoring operation during this period.

Questioned about the scope of the project, moody

stated that all monitoring was a result of a USIB require-

ment and that it was also in response to another agency's

specific request.

Moody confirmed that there was a total

of 1100 names of U.S. citizens and groups on the watch

list; the largest number at any one time totaled about

generated each month, nor how much was disseminated to

other agencies.

did say that there was never any

great amount of material, and that it was a small portion

of their SIGINT effort.

In terms of what material was

disseminated to which agencies, Moody said that it depended

upon their requirement; anything related to foreign con-

nections with domestic

activities would be sent to cia.

and the product regarding domestic groups

would be sent

to FBI. Obviously, if an agency had submitted a name,

they would have received the product on that name.

She stated that some NSA take was purportedly

help save Henry Kissinger's

life as well as that

of Undersecretary Sisco.

Moody was unclear as to when the General Counsel's

office first became aware of the watch list, but knew

that Lew Tordella informed both the General

Counsel

at

CIA and DoD about

the watch list in 1973.

Moody was asked about the activities during the

Huston Plan and IEC periods.

She stated that certainly

fact, she recalls

a proposal to change the charter of NSA so that the

Agency could target domestic citizens without having to

worry about the foreign communications caveat. Moody

stated that if NSA were asked to monitor activities of

radicals domestically, and the charter was changed, they

would "carry out what

we were told to do."

Moody recounted lof us the dialogue between Henry

Petersen of Justice and

and Tordella on the

legality of the NSA watch list. She said that it was the

opinion of the Justice Department that the activities

against American citizens should be halted.

She stated

that this was a confusing period because for awhile they

thought all watch list activity was supposed to be stopped,

including that directed against foreigners.

Moody recalled that some of the watch list files were

destroyed in January 1974 and that she participated in

that decision.

It was decided that most of their material

should probably not be kept for a period of over five

As for the different attitudes ex-

pressed over the

watch list material, she attributed that

to the post-Watergate atmosphere.

She also stated that

Tordella may have been talking with the General Counsel

about the legality of the drug intercepts.

She does remember that the general requirement to

in civil disturbances was pro-

bably sent to the voice intercept stations.

were not

In terms of the biographic information included in

the footnotes, Moody said that most of it came from in-

ternal sources; C-5 and some from CIA. She does not re-

call ever calling, or knowing of anybody calling the FBI

to get information

to puton a

piece of watch list product.

Moody was asked about the memorandum that she sent

out in May 1970 which instructed all agencies

to re-

affirm their interest in the watch list product. The

was that she was instructed to keep records on who gets

what.

Both the Director and Deputy Director knew about

sending out that memorandum.

She did recall that there

may have been a question at the time of the possible im-

portance of the product, but doubted that there was ques-

tioning of the legality of the activity in 1970.

Finally, Moody stressed that the highest levels of

NSA were informed at all times about the watch list

activity; she expressly stated that the perishable nature

of SIGINT information caused them to be particularly

attentive.

There was a specific concern for any divulging
