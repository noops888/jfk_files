When AMHINT-2 finally returned, a meeting was held with him on
17-Augusts -ZAMKA, NOEMAYR, and NELANDER represented ANHINTS, AMSPELL
and. AMBARBS, ‘respectively, and during a two-hour sess on, discusses
the points set forth inthe AMSPELL m moranduni, and: much of the”
JMWAVE- control problem with AMSPELL.” In retrospect, the meeting could
not -be considered a success. Although ‘some AMHINT paramilitary opera~
tional problems were resolved, AMHINT-2 was adamant in retaining
control of AMBARB funding of at least one official delegate in each
country. He refused to eveo discuss LCFLUTTER for himself ~ he did
however assure those present that this was personal and that other
AMSPELL leaders may submit at their own discretion. One issue hich

Jeaders had been assessed, AMHINT-2 could then be issued an ultimatum,
essentially “shaming” hin into acceptance. a

About this time, 20 August, mother message was received from
ANHINT-53 (Reference B). He advised AMSPELL headquarters in Miami
that he would arrive on the 2lst - no request for an operation, no
mention of mode of trave: point of exit 0! try. And as the days
passed no sign of AMHINT-53 either.

By .the time JMWAVE had received instructions from Headquarters to,

and there was not enough AMSPELL participants or“officiais*to ‘satisfy.
the demands of press, television, radio, and personal appearances.

{ _JMWAVE, however, ‘canniot-afford to be very. objective about AMSPELL

‘revolutionary zeal that not only aggravates the cold war exchanges,
but places the Task Force - and ultimately, KUBARK - in an awkward

and untenable control position as far’ as PBRUMEN independent action

is concerned. It would be no overstatement to say that this exile
group could sink a Soviet vessel and force ODYOKE to the brink of

war. Therefore, on 30 August, when AMPALN-4 reported that the .AMSPELL

conferences with TROUCHARD, ZAMKA, NOEMAYR and” NELANDER. The. results
were reported to Headquarters by REUTEMAN in WAVE-7899- on30 August,
1962. In short, this Reference reviews the AMSPELL independent course
of action, consequent liability KUBARK, framework of the JHWAVE
relationship with AMSPELL and present commitments, and pointed out
that the ultimate test of the control issue would be the severance:
of AMSPELL support funds. Headquarters comments and concurrence
were requested but during the first week in September, this problem
was treated during a series of conversations between the Chief of.

as such, the AMBARBs are themselves removed from the center of such

the policies of their organization and the. statements of its leader;

‘for the present’ by AMBARB to. its delegates). JMWAVE does not: believe.

remembered that these overt’ AMBARB activities give the org:

its public reason for being and, therefore, a cover facil uiide' rr:
which AMBARBs may be utilized by local Stations for covert -aetivat
Since AMBARB is jealous of administering the funds for its overt
activities, JMWAVE feels it should be permitted to do so for the sake
of KUBARK rapport with the group. At the same time, although. AMBARD:.
delegates receive from AMBARB propaganda materials; thé
and funds to cover local expenses in carrying out the overt. AMBARB
mission, local Stations are not precluded from exerting influence on ‘
AMBARB- activities supporting GYROSE objectives, Since the local
Stations will be paying the salaries of all but one. AMBARB:: their.arens
as well as funding covert activities, it should be possible for local
Stations to influence overt AMBARB work substantially, By agreement
with AMSPELL, all covert utilization of AMBARBs by local Stations is
strictly by arrangement between-the ANBARB representatives themselve:
and the local Stations, and-AMNSPELL expects no information concer
such. covert use either from JMWAVE or. from: its AMBARB representatives
in the field, :

Over a period of time, we expect that local Stations will gradual}
take over completo AMBARB funding. For example, in Chile the Santiago
Station has assumed funding of all three AMBARBS, although BD-3269
required that it fund only one AMBARE.. We convinced AMSPELL to accept
this situation, so that, in effect the Santiago Station will exercise

There is an additional advantage in permitting  AWBARB-to pay the
Salary of at least one of its delegates by: mail from Miami and in
allowing AMBARB to disburse funds, provided by. JMWAVE, for overt
AMBARB activities. By this ‘means JMWAVE isvinia sition ‘obtain
from AMBARB a coordinated monthly progress .report“of the ‘total overt
AMBARB work; this report’, forwarded in the Sroup of attachments to

reference in assessing the overal] AMBARB overt effort, Naturally,
for its part, JNWAVE does everything possible to elicit from AMBARB
as complete an accounting as possible of the monthly Propaganda ~
activity undertaken by each AMBARB delegation throughout Latin America,
Since it is doubtful that a timely, coordinated picture of all AMBARB
activitics in all countries could be obtained by means of separate
local Station progress reporting on overt AMBARB work, JMWAVE con-
siders this system the most satisfactory for keeping tabs on.such
widespread activities; we are doubtful that any centralized control
