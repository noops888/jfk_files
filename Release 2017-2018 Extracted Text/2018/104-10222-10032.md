Dear'Mr._ gages. :

fi ‘
Reference je rade to your current contract with the United Statea
Government, ao represented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been rscently completed allowing certain :
independent contracture of this organization to obtain sucial security : a
. credite by covering such individuals under the social security tax i
provisions applicable to employees. These arraagements also include a
@ provision for retroactive applicability to the beginaing of the caaae }
1965 tax year. Thin can be done only for reasons of security since 4
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax fromthe =. Hq
ee self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4h and 3-5/8% respectively.

out

Ae @ consequence thereof, ead contract ie amended by deleting
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

° “Effective ! December 1964, social secarity taxes will be
a - deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same
manner and to the same extent as vould be done Sf you were a Govern:
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an-
“ employee-employer relationship, Your legal etatua under thie agree-
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor."

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security.
credits from overt scurces you will so notify this organization and an

adjustment will be rade or[_________facontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to thie

organisation. {a such‘event your (___Jeredita will be erased and your
(|deduetions returned. :
