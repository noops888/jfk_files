SOUR TED

THAT A SOVIET NAS RECRUITEO BY FORNER COS (ROGER TO KINGMAN)

DURING HIS TOURA

APART FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUM

STANCES UNDER WHICH THE HECRUITMENT WAS MADE, THE SIMPLE STATE-

MENT THAT A SOVIET OFFICIAL WAS RECRUITED IS SUFFICIENT TO

SET OFF A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION BY THE KGB INTO EVERY

SOVIET OFFICIAL WHO SERVED IN MEXICO CITY DURING THAT TIME

FRAME. THE SOVIETS MAVE THE RESOURCES AND DETERMINATION TO

EVENTUALLY IDENTIFY THE SPY.
