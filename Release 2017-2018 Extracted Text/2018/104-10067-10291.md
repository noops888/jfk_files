CRIPTION THROUGHOUT THE TAPING..." IS REFUTED BY THE STATEMENT

DURING HIS TOUR, APART FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUM=
STANCES UNDER WHICH THE KECRUITMENT WAS MADE, THE SIMPLE STATE
MENT THAT A SOVIET OFFICIAL WAS RECRUITED IS SUFFICIENT TO
SET OFF A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION BY THE KGB INTO EVERY
SOVIET OFFICIAL wHO SERVED IN MEXICO CITY DURING THAT TIME

EVENTUALLY ICENTIFY THE SPY,
