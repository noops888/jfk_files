Wilhite wanted the Attorney General

Office and through him make necessary arrangements where a meeting

can take place.

For your information, the subject is believed to be

emotionally unstable and has been known to the Bureau since 1946

when he was arrested for illegally wearing an Army uniform.

Lately, he has become a serious and general nuisance stemming

from his impersonation of Assistant Director William C. Sullivan

of this Bureau by renting post office boxes in his name, by

sending literature in his name to the Central Intelligence Agency

41-51-316 and by placing telephone calls to Mr. Sullivan at the office from

various locales in the United States. In May, 1962, he appeared

at Mr. Sullivan's office and became so belligerent it was necessary

for him to be escorted from the building. He has an obsession to

serve this Bureau as an informant; however, we have advised him

we have no use for his services.

Because of his mental condition,

prosecution has not been undertaken for several previous Government

crimes committed by him, including the above-referred-to

impersonation violation

of Mr. Sullivan and a violation involving

his signing the late President JOhn F. Kennedy's name as the

maker on a check in the amount of $10,000 payable to A. P. Wilhite.
