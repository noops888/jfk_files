at which AlCARBON-? Introduced

As a rosult of this initial meeting on

to the fulfillment of the over-all MYAVE mission.

this, a special activities report is being submitted to cover the

nature of JAVE!s

relationship with AMCARBON-1 during the

period December. 1962 to March 1964.

FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR JYAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITTI AMCARDON -1.

Then ANCARBON-Z Introduced ACARLON-I tO REUITMAN, ANCARION-2

revlewed the ground rules under which he had been cooperating

w1th REUTENAN.

This review was conducted for AMCARbON-l's

benefit, in order that he might clearly understand the frame of

reference. which should prevail in his relationships with REUTENAN.

In this review, ANCARBON? pointed out that it was the policy

. of the Identity 3 that it would take no action which would

purposely embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations. As

• a result, 1f any

embarrassing 1tems relative to KUBARK's operations

•In South Florida did come to the attention of the Identity 3, this

material would be brought to REUTEMAN's Immediate attention.

AMCARBON -2 made 1t clear to AMCARBON-I that such items should be

discussed with ROUTCHAN In & frank manner.

the point that,

after an item was discussed, AUCARBON-1

AMCAREUN-2

should follow REUNtiAN's guidance relative

to how any particularly

embarrassing item might be handled by the Identity 3,

would not expose KUBARK operations and, at the same time, would

not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3.

In addition, AMCAREON-2 pointed out that

1£ ANCARBON-1 brought

a potentially embarrassing item to REUTELAN's attention and

remedial action on the matter was not taken, by REUElAN within

a reasonable period of time,

then the Identity 3 would icel free

to expose any ineptness on KUBARK's part.

ANCARBON -2 pointed

out that in return for this cooperation from the Identity 3,

REUTEMAN had agreed that he would be avallable for contact by

telephone or periodic personal meetings at which AMCAREON-1

and ANCARBON 2 could discuss broad trends and developments in

Latin American affairs.

ANCARBON- advised AHCARBON-1 that this

arrangement did not mean that AlCARBON-1 could expect to obtain

any classified information from REUTOMAN.

The point was also

made that AMCARBON-1 should not press for the obtaining of

classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips

which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast breaking news storios.

ARCARBONI Indicated that he understood the frame of reference

which had been outlined by AMCARBON -2•

This frame of reference

has prevalled throughout JMYAVE's relationship With ANCAREON-1

during the period December 1962 to March 1964.

AMCARBON-1'S JOURNALISTIC CARMER.

ANCARBON-1 originally

started to work for the Identity 3 in 195% on the City Desk,

and subsequently advanced from this assigment to an assignment

which entailed covering major political developments in Florida.

At & later date, ANCARBON-1 became a feature writer for the

Identity 3.

they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been relegated to positions

of obscurity once the revolution had put CASTRO In power.
