MEMORANDUM FOR : The Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT “4 Beok Review: Portrait of the AXasassin by
Congressman Gerald R. Ford with John R.
Stiles,

lL. This memorandum is for information oaly to bring to your
attention a forthcoming book concerning Lee Harvey Oswald by_
Congressman Gerald R. Ford with John R. Stiles, entitled Portrait of
the Assassin (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1965).

2. dé. Stiles is a long time political associste of Congressman
Ford and was his special assistant throughout the Coagressman's tenure
as a member of the Warren Commissica established to report om the
assassination of President Keanedy. This bock is written mot so much
to tell the story of the assassination of the President as to present a
study of Oswald as @ person and to describe his trips and activities
insefar as they are known, The book is comprised in very large measure
of extended extracts from the published records of the Commiesion, The
testimany and views of Oswald's mother, wife ead brother, as well as
others who knew him, are eet forth in some detail. Some emphasis is
laid on Oswald's stormy relations with his wife and his forcefel reactions
te difficalt periods in that relationship.

3. Congreseman Ford tells of some of the problems the Com-
mission faced in developing the evidence in the case, but the book is not
critical of the Commission or of its cenclusicas. Portrait of the Assassin
contains very few references to CIA (pages 13, 17-19, 23, 23-24, 61, 152-3,
291, 352, 460), and these are unobjectionable. Only slight moation is made
of the charge put forth by Oswald's mother and others that Oswald may
have been a CIA agent. In his conclusions, Ford stresses the importance
of "meaningful human relationships”, and that these are what Oswald lacked.

4. The first chapter of Portrait of the Assassin, entitled

The Commission Gots Its First Shock, deala with the charge, seriously

advanced by Texas law enforcement officials, that Oswald was in fact

an FBI agent and sets forth some of the Commission's deliberations as
to how best to prove the truth or falsity ef this claim which was also
being raised by certain other individuals and public media. As Congress-
man Ford and the Commission Report and testimony point out, the charge
was sever sustained. However, some of the writing in Chapter 1 is pos-
sibly loose enough to allow for quotation eut of context for theses who seek
te damage the image of the FBI, In February, when CIA saw the galley
proofs of this book, this information was called to the attention of the
¥BI on 8 confidential basis. However, ne action was probably taken by
them, because there appears to be mo change in the published version
from the text ef the galley proofs,
