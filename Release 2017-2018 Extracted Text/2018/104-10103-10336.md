in Spain-(which:Eepinosa entered illegelly), Espinosa was in~
formed that. there is a plan to-overthrow the Castro regime
and to kill Castro and sowe.of-his main leaders, The plot is
led by: Cubele# -an@ some of the March 13:Movement, plus (I be-
lieve) some:militaury officers; They must move very quickly
because: more and ‘more people are.learning of the plot and ~
there.is growing risk of exposure,’ They are anxious to have
some coordination, :or at leeet consultation, with responsible
Americans, ~!Theyiare:not :confident: that ‘they could win an all-
out fight against.:the Cestro forces, and are ‘thinking more in
terms of taking control for a short time (perhaps only a few
hours), -killing Castro and his most effective men (thus _
ruining -the Castro wovement ‘forever), end then trying to hold
out..for as long as feasible.‘ It+is essential that ‘they know’
what, if anything,.the Americans might“do to help, ‘now and/or |
later, when. the-coup. is.attempted.~ Also, they wished to alert
the United States Government-to what was: being planned.’ : aan

O'Brien did so,- Espinosa then told the foregoing story, and
more, -to a CIA.men named "Hal", Hal impressed Espinosa as
being intelligent and reliable, Espinose understands that Hal
or someone else went. to Spain to check on his story, At all
events, Espinosa was assured CIA understood the urgency of the
matter and that he would be called within a few days. ‘A week

running out. Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,
ceutiously asking whether there has been some "response",

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off, Meanwhile,
the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to
xeturn.” Espinosa keeps waiting to hear ‘whether the Americans
will play ball with the Cubelag “group. . The plot has lasted
for over 18 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very
soon rio matter whether the Americans “play ball" or not, One
reagon is that they almost have to go ahead now, for the plot

will soon be discovered and then. it will be entirely hopeless.

Espinosa also referred to a jeweler by the name of
Teppeliino spelling?), located at 47th Street, in New York
City. TeppéJdtino works for CIA and has frequent contact with
the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris, . The Ambassador regularly dis-
poses of jewelry and othe: valuables made available from Cuba,
He does this through Tepp: no, However, the latter fools
CIA, ; For example, the Ambassador agrees to sell for $80,000.
Teppel4ino informe CIA the price is $110,000, and quietly
pockets the difference. On the other hand, TeppéjJiino and
CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for
CIA, but the Ambsessdor does know.

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous
situation o€ the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level
official in the United States Government unless he receives
at least some reply from CIA.

Comment:

Espinosa was not overly tense and did not indulge in his-
trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this
matter further if he did not get some response within the very
near future, I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reli-~
ebility on the basis of this one conversation, However, if I
hed to guess at thie point T would be inclined to accept most
of what he said about actual events, But of course there are
all sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocation,

In accordance with what we agreed on, while Espinosa was
