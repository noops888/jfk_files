Visit of Cuban Exile Victor Espinosa.

In accordance with our conversation yesterday I have set

forth below a report on the visit of Victor Espinosa: maisle

A Venezuelan Christian Denocratic friend of mine, Valmore

Acevedo, called me from New York City yesterday worning,ito ask

as a personal: favor «that I receive a Cuban exile living there

skepticism, Acevedo urgently repeated his request and I agreed.

Within a surprisingly-short time the Cuban, Victor Espinosa,

arrived at my office (be said he had taken the plane lumedi:

A little earlier this year Espinosa received a request

in Spain (which Espinosa entered illegally), Espinosa was in-

formed that there is a plan to overthrow the Castro regime

and to kill Castro and some of his main leaders.. The plot is

led by Cubelap and some of the Merch 13 Movement, plus (I be-

lieve) some military officers. They must move very quickly

because more and more people are learning of the plot and

there is growing risk of exposure. They are anxious to have

some coordination, or at least consultation, with responsible

Americans. They are not confident that they could win an all

out fight against the Cestro forces, and are thinking more in

terms of taking control for a short time (perhaps only a few

hours), -killing Castro and his most effective men (thus

ruining the Castro novement forever), and then trying to hold

out for as long as feasible.. It is essentiel that they know

what, if anything, the Americans might do to help, now and/ox

later, when the coup is attempted. Also, they wished to alert

the United States Goverrment to what was being planned.

Espinose hurriedly returned -to New York Clty. He called

running out. Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,

ceutiously asking whether there has been some

"response"

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off.

Meanwhile,

the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to

return.

Espinosa keeps waiting to hear whether the Americans

will play ball with the Cubelas group.

The plot has lasted

for over 18 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very

soon no matter whether the Americans "play ball" or not. ' One

reason is that they almost have to go shead now, for the plot

will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

espinosa also referred to a jeweler by the name of

Teppellino (spelling?), loceted at 47th Street, In New York

City. Teppelino works for CIA and has frequent contact with

the Cuban Ambassados, in Paris:

CIA, but the Ambassador does know.

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous

situation of the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level

official in the United States Government unless he receives

at least some reply from CIA.

Conment:

Espinosa was not overly tense and did not indulge in his

trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this

matter further if he did not get some response within the very

ability on the basis of this one conversation. However, if I.

had to guess at this point I would be inclined to accept most

of what he said about actual events. 'But of course there are

all sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocation.

waiting, I returned and told him at some length that of course

this was not the sort of thing we got into.

However, I added

that I would see to it that someone called him. I further

said that, unofficially, I had enjoyed talking with him.

Espinosa seemed somewhat mollified and temporarily reassured

by this. However, I doubt very much that he will wait longer

than two or three days more before making another attempt to

bring this situation to a head.
