(e)

On 7 February, Maj Watlington called undersigned to report

the results of his conversation with Mr. Fortier, Bureau of Customs, Miami.

s0).

Fortier referred to his file and stated the following:

. No action has been taken on the case.

It is being handled in Tampa--No

government agency (meaning CIA) had interceded on their behalf, therefore

there was little liklihood of favorable adjudication or prompt action.

3.")

(d)

Fortier stated that the ten individuals on the boat at the

time of impoundment, had come up for trial on 10 December 1962, He did

not know the outcome as these cases were turned over to the Justive

Department for prosecution. In most cases such as this, the individuals

were released with a fine.

to more than $2500 it had to go before a Federal court for disposition,

and that in cases such as this, the material, if confiscated, was

turned over to the Government; in this case where arms were involved, to the

Defense Department,

Mr. Fortier suggested that if there were any effort to

release the material by an interested government agency, it should be made

through Mr. Philip Nichols Jr. (Mr. Nichols is Director of Customs, Washington).

He hazarded the opinion that if such an effort were made, the material would

probably be returned.

He did add that the boat was a Cuban boat, stolen from

Cuba, although he did not believe this effected the adjudication of the

case.

DUP 7L8) (VECIANA) has been called three times since his visit

to Washington.

I each instance there was no further progress to report

tọ him, aside from telling him we were continuing to look into the case.

On the latest contact he was told we would have an answer, one way of another,

by 15 February.
