MEMORANDUM FOR:

VIA:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Director of Central Intelligence

Acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

John H. Waller

Inspector General

The Defectors Nosenko and Golitsyn

1. Action Requested:

Approve providing the SSCI with additional material

on above subject per Paragraph 4. belov.

2. Background:

This report concerns the extent of information on

the defectors, Yuriy Nosenko and Anatoly Golitsyn, which the

Agency has made known to the Rockefeller Commission and to the

Senate Church Committee and its oversight successor, the Senate

Select Conmittee on Intelligence.

NOSENKO: The record shows that the material listed

in Attachment A regarding Nosenko was passed to the Rockefeller

Commission in February 1975.

This material held by the

Rockefeller Commission was subsequently made available to the

Church Committee for its investigation. Additional material

gathered by the Rockefeller Commission on Mosenko through inter-

views with former employees, etc. may also have been made avail-

able to the Church Committee but we have no record of it. The

Rockefeller Commission's brief mention of the Mosenko incar-

ceration in its final report is attached as Attachment B.

The material concerning Hosenko which was provided

the Rockefeller Commission included details of his background

in the KGB, his recruitment in 1962 and his role as an agent in

place, his defection in 1954, the nature of his involuntary con-

finement by the Agency during the period 1964-67 and the author-

ity on which the confinement was based. The Rockefeller Commis-

sion was also provided a 15-page

summary, perhaps better termed

an apologia, prepared by the DDO's Soviet Russia Division and

CI Staff in 1967. This paper sets forth the doubts. concern-

ing Nosenko's bona fides, the inconsistencies in his debrief-

ings, his increasingly uncooperative attitude, and the indi-

cations of deception during his initial polygraph examina-

It describes how the determination was made that

Nosenko was a dispatched KGB agent with a deception mission,

and how Nosenko was then incarcerated to preclude any con-

ceivable means of communication with the KGB. It was then

believed that intensive interrogation, coupled with a Spartan-

like existence in solitary confinement, would eventually break

Nosenko and bring about a confession as to his true status and

KGB mission. Nosenko withstood the arduous regimen and was

subsequently vindicated.

Other material furnished the Rockefeller Commission

on Nosenko included

a rather short summary prepared by the Of-

fice of Security which touched on Nosenko's ultimate vindica-

tion, rehabilitation and current status as a Paid Consultant.

There is no indication that Soviet defector Golitsyn's original

stimulus to the Nosenko controversy was ever surfaced to either

the Rockefeller Commission or the Senate Select Committee.

Golitsyn has inspired and supported the CI Staff suspicion that

Nosenko was a dispatched KGB agent. A study of the Nosenko

case (which takes issue with the earlier suspicions toward and

treatment of Nosenko prepared by retired annuitant John Hart

in early 1977 called "The Monster Plot" has not been shown to

the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and, of course, was

not finished in time to have been made available to the earlier

Church Committee.

It should be noted that there is a Memorandum for the

Record prepared by CIA's Legislative Counsel, John M. Maury, on

5 August 1969 entitled "Briefing of Key Congressional Contacts

on the Nosenko Case" (see Attachment C). This indicates that

Congressional oversight committees or oversight committee star-

fers, at least, were privy to CIA concerns regarding Nosenko's

bona fides as long ago as 1969. This memorandum includes re-

of Nosenko, justifying it to per-

, with the concern he might be targeted

Tor "exocurie actions the Soviets should discover his miere-

abouts.

Nosenko's own attitude since his abuse by CIA seems

to have been philosophical and forgiving.

He has lodged no

complaints.. Nosenko continues to be fully cooperativa and

siated his feelings to the Office of Security in 1975 to the

effect that he desires no publicity; it would place him in

personal danger and it would certainly discouraga any Soviet

official from defecting for years to come.

GOLITSYN: Information provided the Rockefeller

Commission and the Church Committee on Anatoly Golitsyn, who

defected in 1961, has been minimal. According to Agency re-

cords, it was limited to recounting the documentation require-

ments, including passports in alias, for change of identity

procedures for Golitsyn and his family on three occasions.

His thesis that Soviet defectors could not be trusted and his

role in working with the CI Staff on an exercise to identify

possible Soviet penetrations of CIA are not believed to have

been known to the Rockefeller Commission, the Church Committee

or the present Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Neither

John Hart's report on Nosenko, nor Bronson Tweedy's report on

Golitsyn, which analyze these situations, written after the

Church Committee investigations, have been shown to the Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI).

It should also be noted that a staff member of the

current Senate oversight committee (Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence), Mr. Jean Malot Evans, was a DDO, CI Staff

careerist until his retirement in June 1974. It is our under

standing that he is, therefore, personally conversant with much

of the background and developments in the Nosenko and Golitsyn

cases, although we do not know how much he has recorded for

the SSCI's benefit.

EDUARD OUN: The Rockefeller Conmission report, on

page 170, mentioned a case where a defector was physically

abused, though not seriously injured, by an Agency employee.

It added that the employee was subsequently discharged by the

harmed by unsubstantiated suspicions that they were Soviet

KGB agents, based on the theories and reasoning of defector

Golitsyn.

This situation had not been previously known by

Miller or the SSCI (although the SSCI's Cl Staff expert,

Evans, as noted above, had previously worked on the DDO's

CI Staff under James Angleton and thus may have had some

familiarity with this episode in the Agency's history).

I also told Mr. Miller that newsman David Martin

seems to be digging into the Nosenko and Golitsyn cases

and is trying to interview various former CIA employees. I

explained that it is possible, therefore, that there may be

public surfacing of some or all of the story.

I offered more complete briefings to the SSCI,

should it so desire.

4. Recommendation:

I recommend that we be prepared to offer Mr. Miller

additional briefings of the Nosenko case and the Golitsyn

case,

should he request more detail.

The ClA should strictly adhere to established legal procedures

swerning access to federal income tax information.

Arconimendatiun (25)

CIA intestigative records should show that the investigation

was duly authorized, and by whom, and shouid clearly set forth

the factual basis for undertaking the investigation and the results

sif the investigation.

C. Handling of Defectors

Investigation of dotectors is the responsibility of the CIA under a

National Socurity Council Intelligence Directive, assignig this duty

to the Agency as a "service of common concern" to the intelligence

communty as a whole.

Within the CIA, the Olice of Security is charged with providing

proper sacmity for the handling of persons who have defected to the

I nited States from other nations, A careful procedure has been derel-

oped for such handling.

Genemily a defector can be processed in a fer months' time. In one

instance, howeror, a defector was involuntarily confined to & CLA in-

dallation for approximately three gears. For much of this time, the

detector was held in solitary confinement under estremely spartan lis

ing conditions. The detector was apparently not physicilly abused.

The justification given by the CIA. for the lengiby confinement arose

out of a substantial concern regarding the defector's bond fides. When

the issue vas finally resolved, the defector was given total freedom and

became a nited States citizen.

Tue confinement of the defector was approved by the Director of

(enra) Intelligence on the iritten adrice of the Gencral Counsel. The

F'Il. the Attorney General, the United States Intelligence Board, and

selecied Members of Congress were all aware to some extent of the

continued confinement.

In one other casc. a defector was physically abused, although not.

seriously injured. The Director of Central Intelligence discharged the

employee involted.

Conclusions

Such treatment of individuals by an agency of the United States

is anlawful. The Director of Central Intelligence and the Tospector

General most be alert to prevent repetitions.
