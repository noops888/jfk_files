MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA: ‘i Acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: John H. Waller
Inspector General

SUBJECT: The Defectors Nosenko and Golitsyn

1. Action Requested:

Approve providing the SSCI with additional material
on above subject per Paragraph 4 below.

2. Background:

This report concerns the extent of information on
the defectors, Yuriy Nosenko and Anatoly Golitsyn, which the
Agency has made known to the Rockefeller Commission and to the
Senate Church Committee and its oversight successor, the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence. .

NOSENKO:. The record shows that the material listed
in Attachment A regarding Nosenko was passed to the Rockefeller
Commission in February 1975. This material held by the
Rockefeller Commission was subsequently made available to the
Church Committee for its investigat Additional material
gathered by the Rockefeller Commissicn on Nosenko throtigh inter-
views with former employees, etc. may also have been made avail-
able to the Church Committee but we have no record of it. The
Rockefeller Commission's brief menticn of the ilosenko incar-
ceration in its final report is attached as Attachment B.

‘The material concerning fiosenko which was provided
the Rockefeller Commission incluced cataiis of his background
in the KGB, his recruitment in 1962 and his role as an agent in
place, his defection in 1954, the n of his involuntary con-
finement by the Agency during the pericd 1964-67 and the author-
ity which the confinement was based. The Rockefeller Commis-
sion was also provided a 15-page summary, perhaps better termed
an apologia, prepared by the DDO's Soviet Russia Division and

CI Staff in 1967. This paper sets forth the doubts concern-
ing Nosenko's bona fides, the inconsistencies in his debrief-
ings, his increasingly uncooperative attitude, and the indi-
cations of deception during his initial polygraph examina-
tions. It describes how the determination was made that
Nosenko was a dispatched KGB agent with a deception mission,
and how Nosenko was then incarcerated to preclude any con-
ceivable means of communication with the KGB. It was then
believed that intensive interrogation, coupled with a Spartan-
like existence in solitary confinement, would eventually break
Nosenko and bring about a confession as to his true status and
KG8 mission. Nosenko withstood the arduous regimen and was
subsequently vindicated.

Other material furnished the Rockefeller Commission
on Nosenko included a rather short summary prepared by the Of-
fice of Security which touched on Nosenko's ultimate vindica-
tion, rehabilitation and current status as a Paid Consultant.
There is no indication that Soviet defector Golitsyn's original
stimulus to the Nosenko controversy was ever surfaced ta eithar
the Rockefeller Commission or the Senate Select Committee.
Golitsyn has inspired and supported the Ci Staff suspicion that
Nosenko ‘was a dispatched KGB agent. A study of the Nosenko
case (which takes issue with the earlier suspicions toward and
treatment of Nosenko) prepared by retired annuitant John Hart
in early 1977 called "The Monster Plot" has not been shown to
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and, of course, was
not finished in time to have been made available to the earlier
Church Committee.

It should be noted that there is a Memorandum for the
Record prepared by CIA's Legislative Counsel, John M. Maury, on
5 August 1969 entitled "Briefing of Key Congressional Contacts
on the Nosenko Case” (see Attachment C). This indicates that
Congressional oversight committees or oversight committee staf-
fers, at least, were privy to CIA concerns regarding Nosenko's
bona fides as long ago aS 1969. This memorandum includes re-
ference to CIA's incarceration of Nosenko, justifying it to per-
mit "prolonged briefing", with the concern he might be targeted
for “executive action" if. the Soviets should discover his where-
abouts,

Nosenko's own attitude since his abuse by CIA seems
to have been philosophical and forgiving. He has lodged no
complaints.. Nosenko continues to be fully cooperative and



stated his feelings to the Office of Security in 1975 to the
effect that he desires no publicity; it would place him in
personal danger and it would certainly discourage any Soviet
official from defecting for years to come.

GOLITSYN: Information provided the Rockefeller
Commission and the Church Committee on Anatoly .Golitsyn, who
defected in 1961, has been minimal. -According to Agency re-
cords, it was limited: to recounting the documentation require-
ments, including passports in alias, for change of identity
procedures for Golitsyn and his. family on three: occasians.

His thesis that Soviet defectors could not be trusted and his
role in working with the CI Staff on an exercise to identify
possible Soviet penetrations of CIA are. not believed to have
been known to the Rockefeller Commission, the Church Committee
or the present Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Neither
John Hart's report on Nosenko, nor Bronson Tweedy's report on
Golitsyn, which analyze these. situations, written after the
Church Committee investigations, have been shown to the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI).

i

It should also be noted that a staff member of the
current Senate oversight committee (Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence), Mr. Jean Malot:Evans, was a DDO, CI Staff
careerist until his retirement in June 1974. It js our under-
standing that he is, therefore, personally conversant with much
of the background and developments in the Nosenko and Goglitsyn
cases, although we do not know how much he has recorded for
the SSCI's benefit.

EDUARD OUN: The Rockefeller Commission report, on
page 170, mentioned a case where a defector was physically
abused, though not seriously injured, by an Agency employee.
It added that the employee was subsequently discharged by the

DCI. This case pertains to the Estonia ard Oun,
who defected in 1955... The employee was also of
Estonian origin. was returned to Headquarters to. face

After lengthy and acrimonious suitability proceedings,
was discharged from CIA in 1961.

3. Recent Actions:

At your request, I briefed the Staff Director of the
SSCI, Mr. William Miller, on 25 August 1977 in broad outline,
and described the incident of Nosenke's incarceration by CIA
from 1964-1967, which he was, of course, already familiar with.
I also briefed him in general terms -- without naming svecific
officers -- how the careers of certain CIA officers had been

oo S/ER


harmed by unsubstantiated suspicions that thay were Soviet
KG8 agents, based on the theories and reasoning of defector
Golitsya. This situation had not been previously known by
Miller or the SSCI (although the SSCI's CI Staff expert,
Evans, aS noted above, had previously worked on the DDO's
CI Staff under James Angleton and thus may have had some
familiarity with this episode in the Agency's history).

I also told Mr. Miller that newsman David Martin
seems to be digging into the Nosenko and Golitsyn cases
and is trying to interview various former CIA employees. I
explained that it is possible, therefore, that there may be
public surfacing of some or all of the story.

I offered more complete briefings to the SSCI,
should it so desire.

4. Recommendation:
I recommend that we be prepared to offer Mr. Miller

additional briefings of the Nosenko case and the Golitsyn
case, should he request more detail.
