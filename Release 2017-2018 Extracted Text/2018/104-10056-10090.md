INSPECTOR GENERAL
MEMORANDUM FOR: SA/ADDO : 7?
FROM: Raymond A. Warren
Chief, Latin America Division
SUBJECT: °.. ., SLHORIZON-1 Report Mentioning Cuban
. Minister-Counsellor Statement on the.
Assassination of President Kennedy
REFERENCE: LA/CO/235-77 Dated 30 September 1977 -

1. The referent memorandum reported information from
a ZRWAHOO intelligence report of a statement made by the
Minister-Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban: Embassy in Kingston,
Jamaica, on 24 September 1977, that "Cuban exiles such as
DIAZ Lan (fnu) (sic) and others had been involved in the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.'' We believe
that this could refer either to Pedro DIAZ Lanz, or his
brother Marcos DIAZ Lanz, formerly Chief and Deputy Chief,
respectively, of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force. Both
entered the U.S. from Cuba as exiles in mid-1959. Since
that time the DIAZ Lanz brothers reportedly have been
closely associated with, and involved in numerous activities
with, Frank STURGIS (aka FIORINI) of Watergate fame. The
Agency assisted in thé evacuation of Marcos, and Pedro
entered the U.S. on his own. Although both were debriefed
by the Agency, there is no indication that they were, ever
considered Agency assets.

2. queried source for further infor- -
mation as promised in paragraph 4 ‘of the reference. The
source said that the MC referred'to the Kennedy assassina~
tion during a pep talk to party members to maintain good
security. Further, that the MC said that "recent infor-
mation had arrived" implicating DIAZ Lan (fnu) (sic),
former air force officer, in the Kennedy assassination
but did not mention any other Cuban exiles by name or give

any further details. Although the M jentify the
source of his information, the source had
the impression that the information might have been included

in a cable from the Cuban Ministry. of Foreign Affairs. The
source is unable to elicit further information from the MC
without jeopardizing his security.
