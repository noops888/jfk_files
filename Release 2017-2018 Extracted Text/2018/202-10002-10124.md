actions would be in keeping with Castro's repeated declara-

tions that Cuba is the main source of guidance inspiration

for the "inevitable". Latin American revolution.

Whereas an

inflamed American public opinion over the killing of even a

few sentries might require strong countermeasures, the

training of a greater number of Latin American guerrillas

than the 1500 or more trained in fiscal year 1962, probably

would not.

Nor is it likely that the return of those trainees

to Latin American countries, their establishment of guerrilla

training bases,

recruitment of additional personnel, and

engagement in insurgency actions would be as immediately

interference with the water supply at Guantanamo.

Similarly, closing access to the naval base Cuban workers who

commute would deprive Castro of a source of foreign exchange.

it is considered that specific provocative actions are less

likely and less dangerous than the intensification of support

Such action not only

is in keeping with the declared communist intention to

"national liberation movements of oppressed peoples" but may

be done by means which

avoid an invitation to overt US military

countermeasures which would endanger the Castro regime.
