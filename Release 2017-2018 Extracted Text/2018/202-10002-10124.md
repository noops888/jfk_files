than risk direct confrontation with the United States. In

the long run, such action is more dangerous and difficult

to combat, and in the short run is less likely to provoke
immediate and effective United States retaliation. Such
actions would be in keeping with Castro's repeated declara-
tions that Cuba is the main source of guidance inspiration

for the "inevitable" Latin American revolution. Whereas an
inflamed American public opinion over the killing of even a
few sentries might require strong countermeasures, the
training of a greater number of Latin American errillas

than the 1500 or more trained in fiscal year 1962, probably
would not. Nor is it likely that the return of those trainees
to Latin American countries, their establishment of guerrilla
training bases, recruitment of additional personnel, and
engagement in insurgency actions would be as immediately
provocative as interference with the water supply at Guantanamo.
Similarly, closing access to the naval base Cuban workers who
commute would deprive Castro of a source of foreign exchange.
While such items as, "the harassment of air traffic into and out
of Guantanamo," or "the harassment of US aircraft operating in
the vicinity of or overflying Cuba," might be added to the list,
it is considered that specific provocative actions are less
likely and less dangerous than the intensification of support.
to subversive forces in Latin America. Such action not only

is in keeping with the declared communist intention to support
"national liberation movements of oppressed peoples" but may
be done by means which avoid an invitation to overt US military
countermeasures which would endanger the Castro regime. Thus,
they are considered as of that level of intensity which Places
them in the most likely category as well as being in the
category of most dangerous to the long range interests of the
United States.
