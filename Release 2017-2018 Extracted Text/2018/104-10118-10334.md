"Zo collect operational information pertaining to LINSRICK personnel
physical facilities." SCANTLING has contirned to provide worthwhile in-
vormation in support of this objective. (See previous project review fouwerded
by IDMIA-2C052 of 18 October 1962.) During the past year SCANTLING was used to
follow up leads produced by both LIFEAT'and LIENVOY in support of this objective.

D.- In support of the Station's harassment campaign against Juan Jose
AREVALO Bermejo, launched at the request of Headquarters,
SCANELING again provided the means for carrying out e large portion
of the action taken, SCANTLING's efforts ranged from the mailing
of "poisoned" candy to the’ target to the placing of threatening
phone calls. SCANILING also made calls to various Mexican news-
Papers and mailed "montage" pictures of AREVALO anda Soviet in-

ED "T@eoLlect operational indymation and identify operational leads
pevtaining to Station targots ‘of unity." The LIENIRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, i still the: tajor contributor to this objective.
LISNTRAP operational emphasis continues to remain in the area of photo stakedut
of prominent Mexitan Comwnists and is presently working fulltime on providing
pictures of individual Conmmnists, homes suspected of being meeting sites used
‘oy tha Commmist Party and the Communist Party Headquarters itself. LISNIRAP
has elso recently begun to be used on AKNICK leads. It is expected that
ectivitiss of PIENVORAP in that latter area will expand in the coming year.

"To provide operational support to Station operations including the
ren’ notel rooms end safe apartments, renting and servicing of post office
boxes, snd conducting counter-surveillances." GSRENDE's contribution to the
ANROD s3eration was noted in paragraph I.A.3.a. above. GHRENDE's comprehensive
area icowledge and personal operational capabilities enable him to make a
valuezL: contribution in such operations as AMROD and also enable him to procure
the most desireable safe sites in support of the Stetion's operations. The
project's sssets, particularly GERENDE 2ni LIQMPTY-10, presently provide 20

c. In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of
an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected
Station technical operation,

3, "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances."" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a, SCANTLING completed a detailed and secure interview of
the fiancee of SESMOOTH to.determine-her connection with the
principals in the MCMAYFOWL casé, particularly any connection
with procurement of of documents used.ii the flight behind the Iron
Curtain, This assignment was extremély sensitive (SCANTLING
was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an
admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview.

information, and samples-of many of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
tae ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961.
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

b, SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

the subject's neighbors ands associates

that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive

purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
information in support of other Station operations,

A, Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended $21, 458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00, It is anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40,500.00, or some $12, 500.00
under the budget estimate of $53, 000.00.

last Project Review forwarded as an attachment
to HMMA~14093, 13 November: 1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per-
taining to the above objective. There follow
a few examples of SCANTLING's production:

be. SCANTLING has been used frequently

to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/

LIMERICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFBAT indicated

that the LIMERICK target was having con-
siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES
concerning the handling of incoming and
outgoing shipments. By discreet investi~
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
sation with additional pertinent information
about the address, owner and type of business

in addition to his contributions to the above objec
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station, For example, SCANTLING
handled several of Raymond H. GERENDE's (ds) operations
while the latter was away from Mexico City during August
and September 1960. Also, SCANTLING has been managing
SEY surveillance team,since the departure of
LACKETT in Augus‘t: 1980, \Et is hoped that

basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day.
Finally, one other significant service is performed by this
base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity,
LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on
visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation, A recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case ofJoseph RalpH MAURIS In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit
the LIMERICK target on a certain day, . The base was alerted
to dispatch the radio-controlled suryell nce team on any

handled by GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective, it
has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform

etext investigations in support of numerous Station activities, The
cases listed below are cited as examples:

a, In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A,3,a, above)
LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his
Mexico City residence which, 1 WHER, compared to Headquarters
provided photographs, left no “Gollbs that GONZALEZ was the

CHANGES oe
A, Simon D, CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of cLAGKErT in August 1960 has
necessitated the detision as‘how best to'utilize the LIIERSEY surveillance
team and still benefitsfrom the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year, As.explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem sould

Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only

as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them,
! The exe ey eaiet of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as

coumterespionage theatres. The : Station would be eae handicapped.

C. Targets of Opportunit "imineiiate availability of independent
assets to perform investigations, “photo; raphic assignments and other
essential types ef Support services. “aS ection with Station targets of
opportunity rep: il advantage which this Station considers
highly significant! LYEMPTY assets that an agent can be
sent to distant areas \in' ‘Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can
be made of individuals-and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and activities,

D, Although the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year,

PROBLEMS:

A. Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units:(LICALLA’ is located in one
of these units) and the Station considered fart ropriate to suspend photo-
graphic operations pending resolutioi of, the’ ituation, At this time,
there is no indication when LIGALILA« opérations will be resumed, The
LICALLA base operator has ‘reported that {there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, sucha
possibility will exist until the‘release of the three technicians. No

other security problems have occurred during the past year,

A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year consid
progress has been made in the Station's handling, i,e., sori
identifying leads and filing, of photographs pr: duced t by the several sases,

B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Rerewal
Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using
HY~-PAN film in night photography, HY-: ea, im was used on a trial

basis during daylight hours with poor x Almost invariably, prints

It should be noted that East

used by the Station for clandéstine photography. The quality of all

base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result
of this new film,

Consequently, were of

C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim
responsibility for the LIIERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casing activities. The tri “ of the LUERSEY team

COSTS

A, Past Project Year - - Station finance’ records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120, 3 doing Fiscal Year 1960 (1 December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16,734.69. Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00. An additional
$4, 000, 00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year,
This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000,00 for the
entire project year,

B, Ensumg Period - Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below,
$31, 900, 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year
1961 and the balance, $21, 100.00, should be. expended during Fiscal

Vii, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No, 230-60, Aunex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emezgency Conditions, "
the Station does not anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives. However, both principal
ageats, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be wo
sources of information to maintain contact wich under any aciverse
conditions, Both of these agents identify the:nselfs,in terms of
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as
Mexican nationals (which they are), It is reasonable to assume, there-
tore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would pecol ie valuable contacts
in any emergency situation; *«



The Station is aware,that the! pieviets <i ct renewal stated that
emergency communications arrangment! were being made, The
Station has finally obtained the U.S; addresses of relatives through
whom GERENDE and SGANTLING could be contacted under most
situations, This information will be forwarded separately.

1. BACKGROUND,
The LIEWIY Project is designed to collect operational information on the

LIMERICK instelletion and personnel, as vell as tergets of opportunity, through

stationary end mobile photographic coverage. In addition, the project provides

the means for investigating leads from the above noted coverages a3 well as other
LIEMPTY supports other Station operations through the renting of

“safchouses, providing and servicing post office vox letter drops, conducting counter

surveillances and investigations and performing related tasks. -

2. OPERATTONS - REVIEW,

The Station feels that it vould be helpful Sy sumarize at thie tine informatio:
previously revorted to Headquarters (see paragyaph3, reference B) concerning the
photo basehouses wider this project and ‘théreyy’give Headquarters en updated frame
of reference in which to view the xroles’.of}) ous basehouses.

The LIMITED and LILYRIC-basehousé: a
installation. . Although on the surface “it }may
provide duplicete take, thts 1s not “th 8. It has been the Station's experience
in running the unilateral E: "operation that a 0900 to evening workday, which
vould be required of e single bagelioise in order to cover the LIMERICK target
effectively, is just too long for any veir of agents to romain effective, This is
especially true when it is considered ‘that these baseaouse operators are ossentially
unsupervised 2uring their workday. It would also be impossible for a single base-
house to provide the kina of coverege the Station needs on the target installation,
especially during che peak hours of activity, namely Inte morning and early aftemon|

" whieh is of LAURICLE interest.

For these reasons, the LILYRIC basehouse gerierally operates from 0900 to 1400 or 1500
weekdays. LIMITED operates from 1200 to 1800 or dark (as the daily situation

@ietates) on weekdays, and 0900 to 1400 on Saturdsys. (These hours are subject to
change to fit Station needs.) Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a need

basis; however, past experience has shown regular coverage of Saturday afternoons

and Sundays is not rewarding. This schedule provides for both basehouses to be in
ection during the peak activity hours of the: CK target. Although even this
errangenent is not completely airtight ,~ anyth: ess than this would present unaccept-|
able gaps in the coverage. It mst also be considered that without two basehouses cover
ing the front of the target instélletiop, any,iliness, personal problem or vacation for
operators of one basehouse would terminate Station coverage,

Also vorth ssntion Ghats pointe’ the ‘radio "alspetching" of the LUBERICE

teem by the LIMITED base.) “Due, 6: acne ‘tight protective security measures instituted by
‘the local police in the area of)% MERIOK installation it is impossible for a
unilateral survelllance team to\s akeout the LIMERICK installation vnen assigned to
coverege of meubers of the LIMERICK staff, LIMETED operator radio dispatches the *
team onto target personnel giving dircetion, means of travel and description of dress
of these targets. This permits the team to commence its surveillance a number of +;
locks from the LIMERICK installation and beyond the protective ring of the local

olice. This radio dispate! makes possible the surveillance of LIMERICK st: a

Which would otherwise be impossible or extremely visi, sea: SD

The third basehouse, LICALLA, provides oe fe ‘the back of the * LIMERICK
instellation and tne garden area. This coverage is the real "window" the Station has
into the LIMERICK target and provides a large part of the information on which
Station bases its identifications of LIMERICK steffers and its estimates of staffing,
personnel positions end intelligence connections of the LIMERICK personnel. Due to
its position, LICALLA is also able to provide information on the LIMERICK installation

Tt is the Stetion's opinion that as Jong. ee She LIMERICK instellation is a prime
target of the Stetion, it will be necesgary\t'msintein the present three basehouses.

In the past it haé been cole ‘hat the LIEMPTY operation provides the majority
of photographs used by the Stetidh in its CE operations against the LIMERICK target.
This is still true and will remain so for the foreseeable future, The Station, end,
particularly that section concerned with the LIMERICK terget, has always considered
the LIEMPIY photo take an essential tool in following the deily activities of the
parsomnel of the terget instelletion and visitors to that instelletion. Obviously
the uost interesting individuels in both these categories are those of intelligence

ODEs) and KUTUBE Ops have wot been impletely i inkdzMee of the back-

ground of the LIEMPTY Prep \’s agent requirements. At the time
HMMA-14093 (Request for ewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, it

was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any additional
questions, based on reports and dispatches not normally available to the
senior staffs, which might be raised during the renewal process.

2, In answer to paragraph 2a, Oliver G, SCANTLING first contacted
Inez PARADA de Moreno in early 1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement,
He visited her as an architect interested in viewing the LIMERICK installation
from the building where she lives, He was socially acquainted with her brother,
-a Catholic Priest, and knew the family to be unquestionably anti-Communist,
However, it would be imprudent on the Station's and | SCANTLING' 'S part to

assume that PARADA does not at least suspect

ese ” the Station would like to emphasize

that photographic coverage is only one of their functions (please see HMMA-12095,

4 February 1959). LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for automobile
surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of persons entering
the front gate, Their photography is negligible compared to their other duties,
The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front
gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the pictures is from the
second floor and above the street traffic which partially biocks LIMITED
photographs, LILYRIC also does individual reports on LIMERICK personnel
entering and leaving the main gate. LICALLA is used almost exclusively to
identify LIMERICK officials and to support Emre requirements in
connection with the LIMESA/LIMUST Project, Indicacion of the etfect-
iveness of LICALLA photographic coverage, cn he Shoo Station has all the,

4, The Station does not agree that the color photograpiay and moving
pictures are a luxury, Color slides were made for identification purposes
and have proved useful, particularly in identifying facial features and skin
coloring, The motion pictures were made at Headquarters suggestion (Please
see HMMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and HMMW-~8438, 26 January i950). _

5, In conclusion, the Station would like to point out that the "photo-
graphic basehouses" represent an integral and significant part of the Station's
counterespionage effort against the LIMERICK installation. These bases do
not produce Foreign Intelligence and should not be considered in such a light,
