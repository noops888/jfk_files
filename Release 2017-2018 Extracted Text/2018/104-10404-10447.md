Enclosure 12

SUBJECT : James GARRISON

1, RI: Tracing continuing, *

2, The following additional information has been obtained since
reference:

a. The New Orleans States-Item of 3 March 1967 stated that
New York radio station WINS said that it had learned from reliable
sources that GARRISON believes that President Kennedy was
assassinated by "a group of plotters directed from Cuba," WINS
reporter Doug Edelson said that the source has access to GARRISON's
files and that, according to the files, "after an abortive CIA invasion
of Cuba, Castro put out an execution order on the President,"

b. A memorandum of 1 May 1967 by Mr, Richard H.
Lansdale, Associate General Counsel, advises that GARRISON
"intends to demand that CIA furnish him with the photograph of Oswald
entering or exiting the Mexico City Embassy."

c. James Phelan is the author of the lead article in the
Saturday Evening Post of 6 May 1967, headed "A Plot to Kill Kennedy?
Rush to Judgment in New Orleans", The following key points chiefly
concern GARRISON:

(1) Phelan knew GARRISON in 1963, when he spent
ten days with him, obtaining material for a laudatory piece
called, "The Vice Man Cometh",

(2) GARRISON and Phelan met in Las Vegas on 5 and

6 March 1967, and Phelan conducted ten hours of interviews.
GARRISON gave Phelan a memorandum of an interview con-
ducted with Perry RUSSO by Andrew J, SCIAMBRA, "a 3l-yean-
old assistant D,A, just a year out of law school! who interviewed
RUSSO for three hours and took copious notes, GARRISON also
gave Phelan a transcript of what RUSSO said four days later, on
1 March 1967, while under hypnosis, The SCIAMBRA report



13-00000

made no mention of a plot among OSWALD, FERRIE, and
SHAW to kill anyone, The 3,500-word report also made no
reference to a party at FERRIE's apartment. It did not
contain a positive identification of Lee Harvey OSWALD as
"Leon"! OSWALD, Shown a picture of Clay SHAW, RUSSO had
not identified him 4s "BERTRAND", The SCIAMBRA report
specified that RUSSO had scen SHAW only twice. It did not
say that SHAW knew OSWALD, °

(3) On 27 February 1967, according to a second
SCIAMBRA report, RUSSO was given sodium pentothal and
then "did make passing reference to the party at which the
plot was discussed", but did so only after prompting by
SCIAMBRA, who wrote, "I then asked him if he could xemem-
ber any of the details about Clay Bertrand being up in FERRIE's
apartment, " 2

(4) Two days later Dr, Esmond FATTER placed
RUSSO under hypnosis (he did so three times in all), When
RUSSO made no mention of a party or plot, FATTER directed
him to see "a picture of FERRIE's apartment and there are
several people in there and there is a white~haired man, Tell
me about it." RUSSO complicd but made no mention of SHAW,
"BERTRAND", or a plot. FATTER then ordered him to see
this picture: “There will be Bertrand, Ferrie and Oswald and
they are going to discuss a very important matter and there is
another man and girl there and they are talking about assassina-
ting somebody... Look at it and describe it to me.'' RUSSO
then told the’ story that he subsequently gave in testimony.

(5) Phelan advised GARRISON of the profound differences
between the first SCIAMBRA report and the eventual RUSSO
testimony, GARRISON permitted Phelan to question SCIAMBRA
directly, in GARRISON's presence. SCIAMBRA said that he
must have forgotten to include the party and its participants,
When Phelan suggested consulting his original notes, SCIAMBRA
said that he had burned them, Phelan asked Dr, FATTER
where he got the information used in questioning RUSSO under
hypnosis, and FATTER said it came from GARRISON's office.

Enclosure 20

SUBJECT -: Gordon Duane NOVEL

~ a
lL ~RI = No record,

2. The following additional information has been obtained since
the date of reference:

“av The New Orleans Tirnes Picayune of 19 April 1967 states
that:Gordon’ Duane NOVEL (see Enclosure 19 of xeference), then living
in Columbus, Ohio, was the subject of extradition charges signed
17 April 1967-by Acting Governor C.C, Aycock, The charges concern
‘conspiracy to birglarize the munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana,
in 1961, “On 18 April 1967 NOVEL stated in an article copyrighted by
the Dallas"Daily News that GARRISON is conducting his probe to
further his political career, "The whole GARRISON investigation
thing is fiction," NOVEL added. "I know the full story from working _
as the prosecutor's security chief." GARRISON, however, has said
that NOVEL never worked for him, NOVEL added, "I think GARRI-
‘SON will expose some CIA operations in Louisiana,"

b.. The New Orleans States-Item of 25 April 1967 states that
NOVEL "has told a-number of friends and intimates he was a CIA
operative and will use this role to battle GARRISON's charges...
if he is returned to New Orleans to face accusations that he burglarized
an oil’ service company's munitions bunker in nearby Terrebonne
Parish."' Steven PLOTKIN, attorney for NOVEL, refused to confirm
or deny his client!s statements, Sergio ARCACHA Smith (see En-
closure 2 of reference) is also accused by GARRISON of helping to
plan the theft of the munitions, The article adds, "To friends and
associates, NOVEL has said that the munitions burglary was no
burglary at all ~~ but a war materials pickup made at the direction
of his CIA contact," He has described the Houma bunker as a CIA
caché for munitions destined for use ih the April 1961 invasion at the
Bay of Pigs, NOVEL has claimed that he worked for CIA in New
Orleans before April 1961,. "Part of his job, he contends, was to
operate the Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front for CIA
communications, With funds funneled to him by the CIA, NOVEL

SEGRE



13-00000

says he prepared special radio commercials used on 300 stations

in the U.S, and Canada, Their cryptographic messages, he claims,
were to alert agents to the invasion date, The commercials adver~

tised aluminum Christmas trees, he says, and the key alert code
names were 'Star Christmas Trees! and 'Holiday Trees', In late

1960, $72, 000 worth of radio time was placed by the agency. On the
day the munitions were to be picked up, he says, he was called by his
GIA contact and told to join a group which was ordered to transport
munitions from the bunker to New Orleans. . . . He says he made

the trip in his own automobile, a Lincoln, and met several people
there ~~ all of them allegedly acting for the CIA, He identifies

them as FERRIE, ARCACHA, several Cubans, and anothér figure in
the case. They loaded the boxes of ordnance on trucks, he continues,
and returned to New Orleans where the explosives were dropped in

three spots -~ FERRIE's home, NOVEL's office building, and the

office of . ... former FBI agent. . , Guy BANISTER see Enclosure
3 of reference), NOVEL claims the munitions were eventually taken
by boat to Cuba for a diversionary Bay of Pigs operation, GARRISON,
however, says the burglary occurred three months after the Bay of
Pigs. He adds that the Houma bunker was leased by the Schlumberger
Well Services Co, of Houston, Texas, "Schlumberger officials say

‘they know nothing of any CIA operations in connection with their
magazine, where oil field service equipment and certain low-yield
explosives are stored,"

c. An AP wire dispatch of 26 April 1967 from New Orleans

adds, "In Columbus, NOVEL said today that 'the statements that I
worked for the CIA are absolutely incorrect. . , The events of
1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion, are none of anybody's business,
including Mr. GARRISON's.

3, RI has no record of the Evergreen Advertising Agency. There

is, however, a record of "Evergreen Enterprise," listed as "cover for
illegal activities", The pertinent document will be obtained and studied.

Enclosure 24

SUBJECT : The SCHLUMBERGER Well Surveying

Corporation
1. | There are extensive CIA traces on this company and on

various persons connected with it, but none of this information is
pertinent to the GARRISON investigation.

2. | A report of 20 April 1967 from the New Orleans office
of the FBI states that a confidential source who is a representative
of a well-known news media said on 20 April that Gordon NOVEL
has reportedly stated that he was employed by CIA and that the
Houma burglary was not an actual burglary. He contended that CIA
had an arrangement with the SCHLUMBERGER Co. (see below) to
keep ammunition, bomb casings, and other material in the bunker,
leased by SCHLUMBERGER. He said that he and Sergio ARCACHA
Smith were still employed by CIA, "The source advised that accord-
ing to information developed to date Schlumberger became upset
over the Bay of Pigs invasion and wanted to get out of their contract
with the CIA. Arrangements were made about three months after
the...invasion for the...material...to be taken out by Novel and his
group."

3. The Domestic Contact Service (DCS) informed Cl/R&A
on 27 April 1967 that the New Orleans office of the SCHLUMBERGER
Well Surveying Corporation is a branch of the main office in Houston,
Texas. The company, however, is French-owned, The DCS office
in New Orleans was in touch with Gharles A. DOH, district manager
of the New Orleans SCHLUMBERGER office, in order to interview him
about a business trip to Rome in June 1955, There has been no subse- +
quent contact. However, the DCS has been and still is in touch with



13-00000

SCHLUMBERGER and Co. in Houston and subsidiary offices else-
where. The most recent of such contacts occurred on 22 March
1967 in Minneapolis, All contact must be approved by the main
SCHLUMBERGER office. Because of French control, DCS dealings
with the firm have been circumspect.

4, | The Office of Security also advised on 27 April 1967 that
questioning of four employees of the Office of Logistics has shown.
that the only arms bunker in the New Orleans area used by CIA was
the Belle Chasse Ammunition Depot,’a deactivated Navy installation
eight miles from New Orleans. There is no present reason to believe
that the’ Agency has been associated in any way with the Houma Air
Base bunker.

3. The New Orleans States - Item of 3 March 1967 said
