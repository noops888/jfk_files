Select, Cormittee on Intelligence

U. S. House of Representatives.

Washington, D. 0. 20515

Dear Mr. Field:

This is in reference-to-your-to letters to me dateä August 215

Haustuly -'75

which request FBI materials relative to Donald Uffinger and Richard

Bast, and interviews with five special agents of the FBI.

While your

letter did not mention the subject of the interviews with the FBI

agents, we assume that the subject concerns Mr. Bast and Nr. Uffinger..

As you may know, this Department is involved in litigation

with Vr. Bast in the District Court of the District of Columbia

styled: Bast v. Kelley. Departmental policy precludes release of

information which may impair the Department's position in any

pending litigation. Your requests also touch upon matters which

are currently the subject of a criminal investigation by the Depart-

ment. Department of Justice policy precludes release of information

which may impede any ongoing Departmental investigation. Certain

exceptions to these policies have been made for the Senate Select

Cormittee when special arrangements have been agreed to which ensure

that neither the Department's litigative position nor its criminal

investigation will be jeopardized. We would be pleased to discuss

such special arrangements relative to the pending Litigation ana

ongoing investigation with you or your stail at your convenience.

OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20530

SEP 3 1975

Mr. Aaron Donner, Counsel

Select Conmittee on Intelligence

U. S. House of Representatives

Washington, D. C.

20515

Dear Mr. Donner:

This is in reference tò your letter to me dated August 27, 1975,

in which you indicated that the Department's position that all oral

requests for materials and information made during the testimony of

Messrs. Pommerening and Walsh before the Committee on August 7, should

be submitted in writing was intended to delay and impede the work of

the Committee.

Your letter makes two main points. The first is that you were

not informed of the Department's position concerning oral requests

until August 21, and the second is that other agencies do not require

similar requests for materials or information to be put in writing.

First, let me explain the reasons for the delay in communicating

the Department's position on oral requests. You will recall that on

August 7g. 1975, Special Counsel Michael E. Shaneen, Jr., wrote to

MI. A. searle fiela, House Select Committee Staff Director and Chief

Counsel, requesting a meeting

on August 8, to discuss the need for

agreeing to structured procedures for processing Committee requests.

It was anticipated that at this meeting agreement would be reached

concerning procedures which would apply to the oral requests for mate-

rials. No response to the request for a meeting was received until

August 18, and the meeting was held August 19. You will recall that

at the meeting, Mr. Field rejected any Iormal procedures for processing

requests. My letter to you was an attempt to resolve, on an ad noc

pasis, a matter leit unresolved by the failure to agree to procedures.

My letter would have been sent earlier had we anticipated that the

meeting would not be arranged until August 19.

Secondly, let me explain why the Department of Justice would like

all Committee requests to be in writing and signed by either the Chair

man, Vice-Chairman, Staff Director or Counsel. Essentially there are

four reasons. The first is to avoid receiving requests for materials

which duplicate or overlap one another. The second is to avoid having

ENCLOSUREY

NW 55321

mid: 281971 P39E2 02160444-49

---

## Page 30

to interpret oral requests which are usually less precise than written

requests. The third is to avoid placing the Department in the position

of having to choose whether to respond first to requests made by indi-

vidual Committee members or to requests made by Committee staff. The

fourth is that written requests afford this office with a formal vehicle

for transmitting Cormittee requests to the various divisions, agencies

and bureaus of the Department for appropriate response and indexing.

I regret that you interpreted my letter of August 21, as an

attempt to hinder or delay the Cormittee's investigation.

In any event,

I have asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prepare responses

to all oral requests; not already responded to, for materials made dur-

ing the testimony on August T, and which have not been covered by pre

vious written requests.

The FBI has enigmmed me that responses to the

oral requests will probably be available by September 12.

To avoid any

additional problems, we request that all luture requests Ior materials

or information be submitted in writing over the signatures of the Com-

mittee Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Staff Director or Counsel.

Sincerely,

Steven Blackhurst

This is to advise of briefing afforded Mr. Tim

Oliphant and Mr. Richard Vermeire, House Select Committee (HSC)

staff members, on 8/22/75 and to identify documents relating to our

Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros) being furnished the

Committee as a result of agreement at the briefing.

Participating in the briefing were Assistant Director W. R.

Wannall, Deputy Assistant Director H. E. Helgeson and Supervisors

Edward J. Pistey, Elmer W. Larson, and David Ryan, all of the

Intelligence Division (INTD), Supervisor Paul V. Daly of Legal Counsel

Division and Mr. Steven Blackhurst, Deputy to Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

General details relating to the origin, scope and objectives of our

discontinued Cointelpros were related to the HSC staff members.

Additionally, general background regarding the work of the INTD,

the organization of the Division and our foreign and domestic intelli-

gence responsibilities were outlined.

• The HSC members expressed

extreme appreciation for this briefing and it was suggested to them

that they and Mr. A. Searle Field, Staff Director, HSC, take advantage

of the formal filmed INTD briefing which has been prepared by the

Sarati

Research (IS-3) Section.

Mr. Oliphant and; Mr. Vermeire indicated they did not

anticipate the HSC would want to explore those areas of Cointelpros

which are being scrutinized by the Senate Select Committee. They

pointed out that Congressman Otis G. Pike, Chairman, HSC, was

extremely interested in developing costs relating to Cointelpro activities,

Re: Houstudy

informant coverage and other areas of intelligence responsibility.

It was pointed out to them it would be difficult to assign cost figures

to any area of our Cointelpros as efforts in this regard were only a

minor adjunct to our overall intelligence efforts. The HSC members

indicated they anticipated carefully reviewing our Black Extremist

Cointelpro and our White Hate Cointelpro as Congressmen Dellums

of California and Treem of Louisiana felt a responsibility to their

constituents to thoroughly review these programs. It was also indi-

cated the program which targeted militants seeking independence for

Puerto Rico would also be reviewed.

During this briefing it was agreed the FBI would imme-

diately make available to the HSC the following materials:

1. The Study Committee report on FBI Counterintelligence

Programs (Petersen report) and its exhibits A through P. It is noted

this report has already been made available to the Senate Select Committee.

Exhibits A through E are individual summaries of all proposals under the

five domestic programs. At this time they are being made available to

HSC, excised to protect sensitive informants, operations and for privacy

considerations.

2. Thirteen documents which have been released in response

to the Cart Stern and Fred Graham Freedom of Intormation Act requests

will be made avalable to HSC. These documents relate to the initiation

of the Cointelpros and have been extensively excised to protect sources,

ongoing investigations and for privacy considerations.

ACTION:

• For information. The Legal Counsel Division should

arrange to obtain the above-described documents from Room 4063, JEH,

for delivery to HSC.

At 10 a.m. 8/18/75, by appointment, Messrs. James B. F.

the activities of the Intelligence Division (INTD).

Hunter E. Helgeson, IS Branch, INTD; SA Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel

Division; SA Elmer W. Larson, Senstudy Project; and SA Fred J. Cassidy,

#1 Man of IS-3 Section, were at this briefing.

After determining that Oliphant and Vermiere had appropriate

clearances, I gave them a rundown on the structure of INTD, the substantive

matters handled by this Division, and the jurisdiction under which we operate

I also advised them that we will cooperate with the House Committee to the

best of our ability.

Mr. Oliphant advised that he was familiar with the Attorney General's

proposed guidelines under which the FBI will operate in the future and asked

what our position on these guidelines were. I told him that we were currently

studying the guidelines and at the completion of this study we would be glad

and the people of the United States, and continues to desire to be responsive

to their wishes. They indicated that the primary area of concern was our

By request, Inspector Bowers called on Congressman

Dale Milford of Texas, a Member of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities, shortly before 10 a.m. on 8-5-75.

The

Congressman furnished the enclosed document which he said had been

furnished to him on 8-4-75. He said he had read it that evening and

was concerned some of the information contained therein might be classified

or based on classified information. He said the document, which he

described as a very detailed questionnaire regarding intelligence activities,

undoubtedly was prepared by someone with a good knowledge of intelligence

organizations in this country. He noted the document shows on its last

page that it apparently was prepared by tire national Security Study Group,

K Institute for Policy Studies,1901 Q Street, Northwest; Washington, D. C

He stated he had never heard of this organization.

The Congressman

was fürnished a brief description of this organization based on' public

source material. Congressman Milford said he had not supplied a copy

of this document to CIA and had no objections to our furnishing them a

copy.

A copy of the document has been forwarded to CIA through the

senstudy Project Personnel of the Intelligence Division.

During the brief conversation with Congressman Milford--

he was rushing to attend a meeting of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities--he expressed grave concern over damage being

done to the intelligence community by the demands growing out of some of.

determination on the part of some Members of the Committee to insist on.

airline employees that they are not to cooperate in any manner whatever

with CIA. He said actions such as this undoubtedly will greatly weaken

our intelligence gathering capacity. He indicated the airline president

apparently had taken this action out of concern that the company might

run into difficulties with some foreign governments if it was in any

way connected with CIA activities.

The Congressman was thanked for having brought this

matter promptly to our attention and for his support of the intelligence

community. He offered to be of assistance to us whenever possible.

The document furnished by Congressman Milford contains

78 demands for information and/or documents from CIA, compliance with

which would reveal the most highly secret operations of the organization.

Four separate categories are covered. These are (1) Table of Organization,

(2) Laws Governing the CIA, (3) The Budget, and (4) Policies and

Procedures Concerning Disclosures.

The FBI is mentioned only in passing in this document;

however, it can be assumed the National Security Study Group of the

Institute for Policy Studies is working on a similar questionnaire

regarding the FBI.

This afternoon (8/21/75) House Select Committee (HSC)

Staff Members James Oliphant and Richard Vermiere indicated to

would like to promptly see all the material relating to

COINTELPRO which has already been made available by access

or delivery to the Senate Select Committee (SSC) :

Because

of the considerable volume of this material and

the fact

that Staff Members of the SSC are in the midst of reviewing

much of it, it was pointed out that the immediate production

of this material to the HSC would pose some

logistical problems

and that, further, itwould probably be most difficult for

them to fully understand the material going into it "cold."

It was therefore suggested to Oliphant and Vermiere that

perhaps an oral briefing on COINTELPRO would be productive

to them.

They immediately accepted the idea and asked for

such a briefing as soon as possible.

We have made arrangements for a briefing as described

to take place commencing at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow (8/22/75) in the

INTD Conference Room. It is planned that the following

individuals in addition to Oliphant and Vermiere will be

present.

Mr. Steven Blackhurst, who is Deputy to the Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the Office of the

Deputy Attorney General has indicated a desire to be present

and plans to attend. It should be noted that we have already

cleared with Blackhurst our having the briefing and he indicated

it would not interfere with negotiations currently under way

between the Bureau, Department and the HSC regarding procedures.

INtD will be present yourself Mr. Wannall),

He felt that a prior review would be intimidating

As an example of the type of information he in-

tends to obtain for the Committee, he cited the identities of

informants, payment schedules to informants and access for

interview purposes to informants. His Committee is interested

in the auditing procedures which are employed and it may. be

necessary to recommend to the Congress that procedures be. es-

tablished which will enable the Congress to exercise oversight

in this area.

RE: HOUSTUDY

With respect to interviews of current and former

Bureau employees, Field was informed of the existing arrange:

ments with the Senate Select Committee allowing a Bureau

representative to be either present and/or available for. con-

sultation if requested by the proposed interviewee.. He was

also informed of the regulations in the Department and Bureau

which require current and former employees

'to. be released, for

purposes of interview. by Committee representatives. He was

also advised that we have generally. been informed in advance

of interviews by Congressional Committees of the identities

of. current and former. employees who were to be interviewed and

of the topic of the interview so that appropriate arrangements

• could be made for such an interview.. Field accepted these pro

• cedures in principle; however,. he felt that in certain instances

the Committee would want to conduct interviews without prior

notification of the Bureau pointing out that current or former

• Bureau personnel might desire to be interviewed without Bureau

knowledge.

It was apparent that the Committee Staff Members of

operations that is enjoyed by. the 'Senate Select Committee and

that it would be to our advantage to this point to educate the

Committee Members with regard to FBI operations and in so doing

concerning payments.

It would appear that a detailed briefing

in this area concerning our informant matters would be of value

to the Staff Members.

At the meeting it was agreed that with regard to the

House Select Comittee request for all materials furnished to

the senate Select Committee, that the House Select Committee

would be allowed access to such material and it they so desire

they would subsequently request the material be delivered to the

Committee.

This is in accordance with the decision made by the

Deputy. Attorney General as relayed to the Bureau concerning the

furnishing of material given to the Senate Select Committee to

Intelligence - General Crimes; Intelligence - Internal

items represent the 'FBI' s'handling of informants in each

of the four areas and include the personnel cost and other

Committee for a period of time after which it is expected

that they will return to the FBI. They asked whether

we have people who maintain liaison with intelligerice or

investigative agencies. They were told that we do have

personnel whö are responsible for maintaining liaison

with each of the other investigative and intelligence

agencies: 'I asked" the staff member's whether. they are

confining their inquiry. to activities. in the

security field

either Counterintelligence or Internal Security. They

indicated that they were

interested in "intelligence"

activities: regardless of whether it were security or criminal.

I asked them then what was their definition of intelligence.

They. responded that they could not provide a definition of

intelligence but thät there are two pending bills, one of

which deals with criminal justice investigative information

and the other deals with criminal justice intelligence

information; and that they would be interested in the

intelligence information side

They pointed out further

that you would most likely be asked for a definition of

intelligence when you appeared before the Comnittee.

Returning to the budget they wanted to know whether

there is any. category which shows what we

spend working with

other agencies.

They were. advised that there is no such

category:

Oliphant pointed out that the: FBI: has always. been

noted for maintaining a good public image.: He asked whether.

in our fiscal year. 1977 Spring Call there was any item setting

forth our cost of public: relations programs or dealing with

the public or" news. media. He"was told that such cost would

be set forth under the program for External Affairs, since

inquiries by the public and the press were generally answered

in the External Affairs Division.

'It was also pointed out

that inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act: are. handled

in a separate Division.

They then inquired as to whether the

FBI's. program priorities are established on the basis of

programs that would generate the best image of the FBI. They

were advised that this most certainly was not the case.

They suggested that you might have these statistics available

the Committee members might be interested in this:

They inquired as to whether we have an accounting

procedures manual and account code. It was explained to them

that our accounting system is undergoing revision in order to.

comply with GAO standards and that our overall accounting

They were advised that the

non-specific and all-encompassing that they could not possibly

be answered in a short period of time if at all.

It was also

pointed out to them that some of the requests. were 'for informa-

tion that even if eventually. compiled would be of minimal

or of no use"to them:

Some of the questions of this type were

the number of payments to the informants. and the number of

informants with

a breakout of multiple payments.to a single

informant. They said that what they were really looking for

in a question of this type was that as of a given time we had

so many Organized Crime,

General Criminal, Internal Security

or Counterintelligence informants. and that they were paid a

certain amount of money. They indicated that if a question

Were

difficult to. answer we should set that forth pointing out

what would be involved in responding to the request so that :

they. could make a decision as to requesting the information in

They next inquired as to whether payments to general

You

responded that while all payments are different since they are on

that a criminal informant may furnish information which results

in a recovery amounting to several million dollars which would,

because of the time and money saved in FBI efforts, entitle

him to. a rather substantial payment. They asked how much an

agent. can pay to an informant without getting approval: It. was

explained to them none without any approval and depending upon

the amount it would need SAC approval or approval from EBIHQ:

RE: . HOUSTUDY

WALSH MEMO

It was explained briefly the SAC authority. to approve.

informant payments.

A brief and general discussion took place of the

expenditure of Bureau funds in which it was 'explained to

them that approximately 79 percent of Bureau expenditures are

for salary and personnel benefits and that these plus rent;

communications and utilities bring the total to almost 90

percent.: They were told that all other expenditures. must be

borne from within the remaining ten percent of this which

included such things as automobiles, equipment, supplies;

travel and any other necessary expenditures to support our

investigative personnel.

They wanted to know whether our budget and accounting

records showed what money was spent for 'COINTELPRO.

They were

advised that. funds were not. budgeted for, spent for or accountec

[or. under any program known as COINTELPRC

Finally, they asked if we had not conducted

several project evaluations.

They were told that the Office

of Planning and Evaluation has. done 'a number of indepth studies'

of Bureau operations which were apparently. the evaluations

to. which they referred.

The foregoing is submitted for information and

record purposes.

offered by the FBI in any Bureau case since 1937, and this

Bureau does not réquest furids for this purpose.

It should

be noted that the Attorney General has the statutory authority

to pay revards up to $25,000 for information or capture of

any person vanted for violation of criminal laws. In this

regard, on the specific instruction of Attorney General

Robert F. Kennedy, a reward poster was Issued by the

Department of Justice August 4, 1961, in the amount of

$10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction

of anyone violating Federal statute in connection with

highjacking of an pircraft. This vas a Departmental offei

and was not considered an FBI matter.

Item j requests access to all payments and breakdown

thereof made to persons outside the FBI with respect to

intelligence and counterintelligence accivities.

This is to inform that above-requested information

is not readily ovallable from payment records maintained by

this Bureau.

Payments of this type made by Bureau field

divisions would be included in the monthly report submitted

by each field division, entitled "Confidential Funds and

Informant Report'' under the category of Miscellaneous

Expenditures. Similar payments could also have been made

by FBI Headquarters. In order to accurately respond to this

request, all miscellancous expenditures made by field divisions;

as well as by FBI Headquarters covering a designated period,

would have to be manually searched and compared with background

material relating to the authority for such payments. To be

responsive to request contained in Item I would involve an

extensive commitment of Burcau manporer and resources adversely

affecting ongoing and current operations.

OBSERVATION

The listing of an individual as

an approved Bureau informant is dependent

upon whether he or she can regularly furnish valuable criminal information.

in most instances an individual will be approved who has:

Furnished north-while information in two or more Bureau cases

Furnished worth-while information in one Bureau case and better than

everage infornation(relating to criminal intelligence investigations j

Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in

one other state or local case which is acted upon by the responsible

authorities so as to obtain corroboration of the. informant's report

Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in

one other Federal case which is acted upon by the interested federal

agency, so as to obtain corroboration of the informant's report

D.

DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

of the most important responsibilities of an Agent is the identi

ficátion of prospective criminal informants and the development of pros

pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute

information to the Bureau.

Criminal informants are used to:

Licabo fugivives and wiinesses

Report cases we would not

otherwise receive

Report plans to commit

Advise of general criminal activities

Informants are developed from those who volunteer to be of assistance;

from subjects

in cases investigated; from persons interviewed during

investigations; and from selected prospects

who are clearly in a posi-

to obtain worth-while information

Their development frequently

requires patient, protracted effort to find a basis for persuading

them to cooperate in furnishing irformation.

Care must be exercised in attempting to persuade individuals to act as

informants to avoid any allegations of undue influence. An individual

who is in custody and who offers to furnis information generally does

so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in retura.

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity or any reduction in sentence

to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves

in a position where they might subsequently be accused of having done so.

an individual has started to cooperate and furnishes information

.of value, his continued cooperation can frequently be assured through

for services rendered and information furnished.

be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to

informants who

substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain

the assistance.

Another important factor in the initial problem of getting a potential

informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treatment

sometimes generated during the handling of a case.

Agents must be alert

to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects and to capitalize on

Should a subject indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,

and should be be qualified to act as a real informant by virtue of his

background and associates, then affirmative action should be taken to re-

contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities.

SECTION 108. CRIMINAL INPORMANTS

7o 'In the initial stages

developing an informant, background data

concerning him

should be compiled

as outlined in section E below.

Once all of this information has been gathered together the techrique

to be used in persuading the prospect to act as an irformant will

depend upon the peculiar circumstances involved in tre individual case

and

upon the resourcefulness of the agent endeavoring to develop the

prospect.

Each field office must have criminal informants who do furnish irfor

mation concerning

all types

offenses "ithin the Bureau's investi-

gative jurisdiction.

In addition, informants must be available

to

furnish information concerning general criminal activities.

adjusted to

the changing volume of

offenses occurring in classifications, such

as :

BUREAU POLICY

All investigative activity must be made a maiter of record in the field

office files with all sources of information being completely identified.

Sources include all confidential informants - criminal, extrenist,

or security.

Agents must not have and use informants known onlj to the individual

Agents personally.

Criminal informants must be advised that they are not Burear emplogees.

It must be recognized that many

such informants are also criminals

considerable care must be exercised in dealing min them so they will

noù become aware of and have the opportunity to obstruct the Bureau's work.

Arrangements must be worked out so that

aù least two agents are in a posi-

tion to contact

each criminal informant.

For a short time

after an inform-

first developed, it may sometimes be necessary to have one Agent make

all contacts.

a program must be established and actually started

within six months after

the informant is developed to establish a working

arrangement so that a second Agent can contact

such an informant.

arises in which this cannot be done, the Bureau must be informed.

Consideration should be given to the assignment of specific projects to

good informants, particularly those who have had little current opportunity

an informant could be prosecuted for technically violating the lan while

attempting to obtain evidence regarding a Federal riolation.

receipt is executed in the name

of an agent or person other

than the agent claiming reirbarsement.

It is desired that inenever possible the receipt

instances this irill noù se practical, for insuance, if agent

Smith makes arrangererts for the rental of an apartnent for

assignment the bill ordinarily will be continued in his name and

paid by another agent.

In instances such as this the agent

who pays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per

The Bureau has noted an increasing trend on the part of Special

igents in Charge of approving confidenvial expendivures nich may aù some

time be subject to question.

The Bureau refers particularly to those ex-

pendituras made by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential informants:

It has been necessary for the: Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

imburse certain Agents for expenditures made when it appeared tha, the ex-

penditures made were out of line in so far as necessity for the securing..

of the information ras concerned.

The Bureau has further noted a tendency

growing up in the field for special Agents in charge to approve confidential

expenditures for l0g and 15% and other very minor amounts which probably

should be subject to further scrutiny by the Spacial Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenaitures but must insist that each spacial Agent in Charge perscnally

review and approve such expenditures as are made by employees under his

jurisdiction. It is understood that with the type of internal security.

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time

of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential

tund and the submission of morthly reporus in connection therewith.

You are aware, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each nonth reflecting the condition of the

confidential. fund in each field office, including therein its status

with respect to the casn balance on hand, plus disbursements which

have been made auring the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-

mit such monthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to othermise maintain an accurate

recora upon the casis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent

in Charge may be definitely determined.

the Bureau over a period of time reflects an increasing number of pay-

ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-

to nature i on it.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at •

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10

to 920. At the time the monthly statement is submitted by the field

office involved, such

statements invariably fail to indicate that the

expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances. they are improperly recorded' in such a manner as to preclude

NW 55321 DocId: 32989713 Page 150

---

## Page 151

-?=•

an accurate accounting on the part of the Bureau

n

respect thereto.

For your guidance in the preparation of future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly

the manner in maich discursements, avances, refunds; or purchases

are to be listed.

All subsequent monthly statements

prepared by

your office should be submittea

strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Spacial Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the

expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue

slips. For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-

odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of

a money order and the money order receipt attached..

..

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-

ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren-

dared by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

•of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the Sureau is necessarily aware of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, que to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for

confidential expenditures wherever it is possiole and otherwise

practicable to do so.

Hereaîter, confidential items will be sus-

pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise,

the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beaaing, clothing, and .

This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the field office inventories.

iccordingly, it is

desired that you forward to the Burcau in the near future a detailed

report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased

and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the sureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by cach of the respective field offices

haying control, custody, or possession of such equipment. With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate nor-expendable receiving slips. Such slips should indi-

confidential expenditure made by any Special Agent of the Bureau unless such

an expenditure ras made for the purpose of securing information relating to

matters under the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau, it not being pos-

sible to secure such information in any other manner.

In making such expenditures, all Special Agents must bear in mind

that reparent can be nade only in the event the cerbification can do made this

• the payment for such confidential information was made in the interest of ine

Government Service, and that the amount paid represented expenditures incurrea

alleged plots or conspiracies against

formation pertaining to violations of the Federal Statutes wich could not

otherwise rave been secured. The information containea on the confidential

¡tem sunitted by the Agent in question should be such that it will ce readily

AUTHORIZINd ExPENDITURES

FROM CONFIDENTIAL TOD

It has been noted that various officials and supervisors are granting.

authority to the fiela offices to make expenditures iron the field office

confidential und.

When Bureau authority has been granted for an expenditure

of this nature, ine field office is required to give such authorization on the

confidential item submitted to recleim the expenditure.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expenditures. In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the Administrative Division, it is noted that in many instences there

will be no recora of the expenditure having been authorized. .

In the future when authorization is grented for expenditures of this

nature, the Administrative Division must be savised.

If the field office is

granted authority by letter, a copy of the letter must be rade for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517. If authority is granted telephonically, it will be necessary

that the official or supervisor granting the authority notify the Aâministrative

Division by remorandum, giving the name of the person to wnom payment is authorized

and the field office involved..

The above instructions are to be placeà into effect immediately in order

to preclude the delay which is now being experienced in determining wether the

expenditures claimed by the various offices were properly authorized.

RE: ACTIVITIES OF TES

CONFIDENIIAL FUND

The Bureau is desirous at the present tire of bringing to your attention

tho absolute necessity for the careful handling of expenditures from the con-

Isntial Iund and the submission of moathly roports in conncotion thurewith.

You are aware that under existing Bureau regulations It is absolutely

essential that an appropriate staterent be sanitted at the end of each month

reflecting the condition oi the Confidential fund in each field office, Including

therein its stetus with respect to the cash balence on hand, pius discursements

which have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to submit such

nonthly statomonts promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming Increasingly

difficult to properly audit the Bureau's records in correction thererith. As

set out In SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, ell Confidential Furd rerorts

should be received at the bureau no later then the 20th of the following Ionth.

•For your guidence in the preparation of future monthly reporis concern-

1ng Confidential Furd exyenditures: there is enclosed a sample form which outlines

briefly the proper rethod of preparing the report. In addition, there is enclosed

a sample form which outlines the retrod which should be used to summarize

the

• payments to infoments and confidential sources. In this regard your attention

1s directed to Saction (A), SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, which is

retised in that the Atomic

Energy informants should be deleted from the report.

The surmary should now reflect rayments to Criminal and National Defense

Confidential Sources.

It has bee

noted that In a, great number

instances Special Agents

have not been sucmitting receipts to justify the expenditures for which re-

imbursements are being clained through blue slips.

The Bureau is aware of the

fact that receipts cannot be secwrod in each and every instance, que to

exigencies peculiar to certair types of activities, nevertheless, receipts

should be obtained wherever possible.

In connection with the preparation of the blue slips it has been

noted that sore are beins prepared too such in deteil. In those instances where

the payment is made to an authorized regular paid informant, the following

infornation is

sufficient to support the clein:

1. Amount of payment

2.

Hare and symbol number of informant

3. Case

4.

Date of authorization letter or teletype

5. Period of beyment

A sample form reflecting the proper method for preparing a blue slip

Is attached.

The Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re-

claiming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the roucher that the item was

suspended from a previous voucher. It is pointed out that no reference should

be made to the previous roucher nor should the igent state that the item was

suspended unless he forwards the original Statement of Difference with the

roucher.

Your attention is directed io the fact that the Bureau has only a

limited amount of funds availabio to operate the Confidential Funds of the

field divisions, therefore, you should make every effort to operate on your

present fund.

It is pointed out that a more frequent submission of Confidential

Fund vouchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the fund.

• In the future when an office desires to esteblish a Confidential

Fund, it will be necessary that the office furnish the Bureau full and complete

justification.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your

Immediate personal attention and

supervision.

The Eureau wishes to point out to you, however, that 1t 15

You should insure yourself

CONFIDENTIAL FUND VOUCHERS - It has been noted in a number of

by the Special Agent in Charge reflect the name of a Special Agent

Effective immediately, you are instructed that in any in-

the Special Agent should also execute a receipt reflecting thai he

received the money from the Special Agent in Charge for the purpose

of payment to the informant and both receipts should be attached to

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES -

FBI FORM BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently

being followed by the various field divisions which were

forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

and from a review of the suggestions submitted along with these

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling

the operations of the Confidential Funds maintained by the various

field divisions should be

established.

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accounting

procedures shall be placed

into effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Che shall be

used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of

the fund

authorized for the field division. Transactions that

suild affect this rund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fünd.

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau.

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received fron the Informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balance

of the total amouni to

be accounted for by the field division.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount

.to

be accounted for.

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page. shall be

lutilized to reflect all

cash transactions which affect the total

fund.

This leager shall be in accordance with the attached sample

(Exhibit Number Two, which reflects examples of various transactions

which will affect the Fund.

This ledger should be retained indef1-

nitely and should be used

as the basis for the preparation of the

NW 55321 DocId: 32989713 Page 173

## Page 174

monthly report. All columns should be ruled off at the end of the

calendar month

and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number

One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements.

The debit

side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from

the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau. All payments made

sources should be reflected in the

column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security Informants

or sources should be reflected in the column captioned

"Security;"

and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either

of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone

companies, taverns, restaurants,

post office

box: rental, etc.,

should be reflected in the column

captioned "Miscellaneous."

The

credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds

from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous

payment.was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous nature.

. Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;

checks

in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent Increases

shouid

be reflected in the "receipts" column; whereas any

refund

from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which •

must be returned to the

Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the "Refunds" column.

Like-

wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be

recorded here. (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.)

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, 1.e, in either the

Criminal, security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to

Bureau column. Likewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts

column, there should be a

corresponding entry in' one of the credit

columns, 1.e., In either the Refunds of Payments column or in the

Receipts .from Bureau column.

- It is to be further noted that the totals of column

Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "sum-

mary of Payments to Informants" In connection with the monthly

report.

The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the crealt side of Column one from. the

total of the debit side of this column.

•3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources.

This section

of the ledger should be divided Into three parts; namely, Criminal,

security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a

separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid

criminal confidential source.

The Security section should reflect

Under the Miscellaneous section, pages

should be set up for rental of space for plants or surveillances,

Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regular

basis. Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-

A sample ci an informant

this page reflects the following information:

a. the date of authorization

b. the authorization

c. period covered by payment

d.

date of payment.

e. amount of payment

In connection with the date of authorization, you are

instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter

to the field division in cases where authorization i's made by

Bureau letter and the

Is made by stamping "approved the Incoming letter when authorization

on a tickler copy of a letter

received from the field division requesting authority.

Before making

any disbursements from the Confidential

Fund to an informant,

the authorization should be checked

sure that there is noù a duplicate payment being made and

that the

period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing

authorization.

These authorizations should be posted in the

ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau.

In connection

with sac authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

is being made under authority of the SAC will be suffictent.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's

f1le (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

•aate should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954;

form FD-228 should be removed from your form book and your supply

destroyed.

After a careful review of the many suggestions received

In response to SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-

ing funds from the Confidential Fund has been designed, a copy of

before any disbursement is made from the Confidential Fund. After

approval of the form by the SAc and

after the employee handling

the disbursements from the fund has carefully verified that the

payment is in accorcance with existing authority,

one copy of the

•form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file which should be

divided into two sections: namely, an unvouchered file ars a

vouchered Ille. These icrms can de used ber the employee responsible

for disburserents from the fund

as the basis for preparing blue

sllps for submission io the Bureau. Of course, these blue slips

should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the

informant Is obtained from

the Agent making the payment, and in

those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the

Agent making the payment.

At the time the voucher 1s prepared, those

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

prepared and retained in the accounts receivable file until reim-

bursement is made

by the Bureau.

At the time reimbursement is

received,

the voucher should be

removed together with the attach-

ments and

a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement

was received from the Bureau.

The Request for Funds forms attached

to the voucher may then be destroyed.

In the event an item has

been suspended from the voucher and returned to the field office,

1t would be necessary to remove the Request for Funds form from

she voucher on which the blue slip was requested and returned to

the unvouchered file until such time as 1t 1s resubmitted or It 19

• determined 1t will not be resubmitted.

5. Monthly Report.

As you are aware, the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared

and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month following

the period during which the expenditures were made.

These reports

should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

the present form for this report have been suggested and âlter a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the

reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example

(Exhibit Number Five).

The monthly report submitted to the Bureau

should be prepared under the direct supervision or the special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly

designated Fleld Supervisor.

The fund should be audited

once. each

six months, on June 30 and December 31.

This audit shall be

personally performed by a Scecial Agent Accountant. The report of

this audit shall be forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of

July and the trentieth day of January. In those instances where

the confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training

and

Inspection Division during a, regular inspection, the next

• regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the Field Division.

With regard to the summary of expenditures

section of

the Confidential Report, It 1s desired

to illustrate the

following

points:

All transactions during the calendar

month should be shown.

b.

All Items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

c .

The explanation should reflect the

name and symbol number of the informant as

well

as the period covered by the payment and

in case of miscellaneous expenditures,

a brief

statement to describe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund to be accounted for

must be fully explained in a cover memoran-

. dum. An example

of such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the Bureau, Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connection with the surmary of payments te informants:

you are advised that all miscellanecus payments must be listed

separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-

tion.

This breakaown should include such payments as post office

or to sources

for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed out here-

tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment to: the

informant should be shown on the blue slip.

This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant.

A blue slip should be prepared at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the Item have been

received from the Agent making the payment.

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make

proper review of the expenditures. Samples are attached

reflecting payments made to informants under bureau authority

(Exhibit Number Six), SAC authority (Exhibit Number Seven), and

miscellaneous expenditures (Exhitit Number Eight). These

samples

are general but should be used

as a guide for preparing all clue

slips.

In addition to the attached samples, it is desired

the following be kept in mind in connection with the preparation

of blue slips:

a. One blue slip should be used for each

payment.

It is not desired to have numerous

payments listed

on a single blue slip in view

of the possioility of error which would result

in the necessity of suspendine the entire blue

slip; whereas 1f only one payment were

listed

on the blue slip, 1t would be possible to re-

turn only the one Item and the

remaining items

could be processed for payment...

b. The authority must be clearly reflected :

on the blue slip.

When authority 1s based

the letter Irom the Bureau, actual date ci che

Bureau letter shall be used

• as the date of the

authorization. Then the field orfice, by letter,

requests authorization and receives notice that

authorization has been granted in the form of a

copy of the field office letter returned by the

Bureau with the Eureau auproval stamped thereon,

the date of the authorization in this instance

shall be.the actual date of the field office let

ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

c .

The actual period of time covered by the

payment to the informant must be reflected in the

body of the blue slip.

For example, see

"Period"

_reflected in body of

Exhibit Number

SiX.

It is

also essential that the period covered be carefully

compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent

exceeding the Bureau authorization, boch by time

and amount.

Receipis should se obtained whenever

possible.

In instances where they are not obtained

either because of the refusal of the informant to

execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain

one, the appropriate notation should be reflected

the blue slip.

d. FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the

Agent reflecting recelpt of money from the SAC is

only to be used when the receipt signed by the

informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

ant's: receipts'executed in the name of the

employee actually making payment or in blank in

order that the Special Agent in Charge or the .

Assistant Speclal Agent in Charge may claim

The Blue slin should not reflect the

number of the check

• issued and no reference

should be made on the blue slip to the inform-

ant's field file number:

g. All blue slips submitted on the monthly

expense vouchers of special Agents must bear the

approval of the Special Agent in Charge; however,

the Special Agent in Charge may delegate authority

to the Assistant Special Agent In Charge or an

approvea fiela office supervisor to sign his name

supervisor.

h. Receipts obtained by personnel which

reflect payments to informants and sources should

reflect the ACTUAL DATE payment is made to the

informant or source.

The receipt should in no

Instance reflect any other date.

The Receipt

should also show the EXACT AMOUNT paid to the

Informant or source, 'and every Special Agent sub-

mitting receipts should thoroughly understand

this procedure.

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES -- I want to draw to your attention

the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential

expenalture authorized by the Bureau complies wich existing ranua

provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of

Seat

of Government employees to be judicious in authorizing expenaitures

to he more and to practice proper economy.

For your intormacion, Inspectors will, in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine the propriety of each expenalture and w1l1

trace

through the files information received and results obtainea,

following the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that

in the event an expenditure is encountered which is. not proper

the employees involved will reimburse the Government.

very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

July 8, 1954

FASHLINGTON 25, D.G.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

Reference 1s made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of

the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which it

Is felt will eliminate some duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to inicrimants on sAc authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants.

It was suggested that the in-

formants' files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,

2954, be entered on the informants' individual ledger pages.

This

would apply only to payments made under sac authority.

It is felt that this suggestion will save considerable

time and work in the field, and you are accordingly instructed

to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting

procedure.

very truly. yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director.

BLUE SLIPS

In the preparation of future blue slips, the

following instructions should be adhered to:

The blue

sips should show the correct name o1

the individual being paid. Any difference between this and

the name used by the informant in signing a receipt for

psyment must be explained on the blue slip.

when a name

other than the Individual's full correct name 1g'used in

InItial development as an informant, his full correct name

should be used on the blue silp as soon as lt 1s known,

together with references to the previous names used in

contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure

Is necessary to enable the

Bureal to properly control payments and to make sure that

all payments to one Individual are consolidated. It has

been noted in some instances that blue slips are submitted

showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are

submitted

showing the individual's middle name as a last

name. This 1s especially true in connection with Spanish

names. Inis practice leads to the possibility of carrying

a separate account of payments under each name.

rake sure that the necessary employees of your

office are aware of this and the need for consistency.

In addition, where an informant or individual

known to have been formerly contacted by another division

18 paid by your division, the blue slip claiming reimburse-

ment should refer to the fact that he is formerly from the

other division.

This 1s necessary to insure that the

Bureau's accounts of payments are properly credited for

payments made.

The Bureau has noted that in many Instances the

field 1s not following instructions concerning the forrard-

ing of vouchers containing confidential items (blue slips)

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-22la be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

'the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

FD-221 and informant regeipts. The matter concerning security for

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security:
