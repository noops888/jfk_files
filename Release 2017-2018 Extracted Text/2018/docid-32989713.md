OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20530

SEP 3 1975

Mr. Aaron Donner, Counsel
Select Committee on Intelligence
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Donner:

This is in reference to Yoiir letter to me dated August 27, 1975,
in which you indicated that the Department's position that all oral
requests for materials and information made during the testimony of
Messrs. Ponmerening and Walsh before the Committee on August 7, should
be submitted in writing was intended to delay and impede the work of
the Committee.

Your letter makes .two main points. The first is that you were
not informed of the Department's position concerning oral requésts
until August 21, and the: second is that other agencies do not require
similar requests for materials or information to be put in writing.

First, let me explain the reasons for the delay in commmnicating
the Department's position on oral requests. You will recall that on
August. 7,. 1975, Special Counsel Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., wrote to
Mr, A. Searle Field, House Select Committee Staff Director and Chief
Counsel, requesting a meeting on August 8, to discuss the need for

agreeing to structured procedures for processing Comittee requests.
It was anticipated that at this meeting agreement would be reached
concerning procedures which would apply to the oral requests for mate-
rials. No response: to the request for a meeting was received until
August 18, and the meeting was held August 19. You will recall that
at the meeting, Mr. Field rejected any formal procedures for processing
requests. My letter to you was an attempt to resolve, on an ad hoc
‘basis, a matter left unresolved by the failure to agree to procedures.
My letter would have been sent earlier had we anticipated that the
meeting would not be arranged until August 19.

Secondly, let me explain why the Department of Justice would like
all Committee requests to be in writing and signed by either the Chair-
man, Vice-Chairman, Staff Director or Counsel. Essentially there are
four reasons. The first is to avoid receiving requests for materials
which duplicate or overlap one another. The second is to avoid having



NW 55321

ra +

to interpret oral requests which are usually less precise than written
requests. The third is to avoid placing the Department in the position
of having to choose whether to respond first to requests made by indi~
vidual Committee members or to requests made by Comittee staff. The
fourth is that written requests afford this office with a formal vehicle
for transmitting Committee requests to the various divisions, agencies
and bureaus of the Department for appropriate response and indexing.

I regret that you interpreted my letter of August 21, as an
attempt to hinder or delay the Conmittee's investigation. In any event,
I have asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prepare responses
to all oral requests; not already responded to, for ihdterials made dur-
ing, the testimony on August 7, and which have not been covered by pre-
vious. pritten requests. “The. FBI hes 2nformed me that responses to the
oral requests will probably be available by September 12. ‘To avoid any-
additional problems, we request that all future requests for materials
or information be submitted in writing over the signatures of the Com
mittée Chairman, Vice- » Staff Director or Counsel.

Sincerely,

Alien Qlash hunt

informant coverage and other areas of intelligence. responsibility.

It was pointed out to them it would be difficult to assign cost figures
to any area of our Cointelpros as efforts in this regard were only a
minor adjunct to our overall intelligence efforts. The HSC members
indicated they anticipated carefully reviewing our Black Extremist
Cointelpro and our White Hate Cointelpro as Congressmen Dellums
of California and Treem of Louisiana felt a responsibility to their
constituents to thoroughly review these programs. It was also indi-
cated the program which targeted militants seeking independence for
Puerto Rico would.also be reviewed,

During this briefing it was agreed the FBI would imme-
diately make available to the HSC the following materials:

: 1, The Study Committee report on FBI Counterintelligence
Programs (Petersen report) and its exhibits A through P, It is noted

* this’ report has already been made available to the Senate Select Committee,

Exhibits. A-through. E.are individual summaries-of all proposals-under the
five domestic programs, At this' time they are being made available to

HSC, excised to-protect sensitive informants, operations and for privacy
considerations,

2, Thirteen documents which-have been released in response
to the Carl Stern.and Fred Graham Freedom of Information Act requests
will be made available to HSC. These documents relate to the initiation
of the Cointelpros and have beén extensively excised to protect sources,
ongoing. investigations and for privacy considerations,

ACTION:

For information, The Legal Counsel Division should
arrange to obtain the above-described documents from Room 4063, .JEH,

I also advised them that we will cooperate with the Howse Committeé to the Sa

Mr. Oliphant advised that he was familiar with the Attorney General's

airline employees that they are not to cooperate in any manner whatever
with CIA. He said actions such as this undoubtedly will greatly weaken
our intelligence gathering capacity. He indicated the airline president
apparently had taken this action out of concern that the company might
run into difficulties with some foreign governments if it was in any

way connected with CIA activities.

The Congressman was thanked for having brought this
matter promptly to our attention and for his support of the intelligence
community, He offered to be of assistance to us whenever possible.

The document furnished by Congressman Milford contains
78 demands for information and/or documents. from CIA, compliance with
which would reveal the most highly secret operations. of the organization.
Four separate categories are covered. These are (1) Table of Organization,
(2) Laws Governing the CIA, (3) The Budget, and (4) Policies and
Procedures Concerning Disclosures.

Mr. S. F. Phillips

This afternoon (8/21/75) House Select Committee (HSC)
Staff Members James Oliphant and Richard Vermiere indicated to
Supervisors E. W. LarSon and S. F. Phillips of INTD that the;
would like to promptly see all the material relating to eZ,
COINTELPRO which has already been made available by access A
or delivery to the Sendté Select Committee (SSC). Because
of the considérable volume of this material and the fact
that Staff Members of the SSC are in the midst of reviewing
much of it, it was pointed out that the immediate production
of this material to the HSC would pose some logistical problems
and that, further, ttawould probably be most difficult for
them to fully understand the material going into it "cold."
It was therefore suggested to Oliphant and Vermiere that
perhaps an oral briefing on COINTELPRO would be productive
to them. They immediately accepted the idea and asked for
such a briefing as soon as possible.

We have made arrangements for a briefing as described
to take place commencing at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow (8/22/75). in the |
INTD Conference Room. It is planned that the following
individuals in addition to Oliphant and Vermiere will be
present. Mr. Steven Blackhurst, who is Deputy to the Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the Office of the
Deputy Attorney General has indicated a desire to be present
and plans to attend. It should be noted that we have already
cleared with Blackhurst our having the briefing and he ifidicated
it would not interfere with negotiations currently under way
between the Bureau, Department and the HSC regarding procedures.

From INTD will be present yourself (Mr. Wannall),
Mr. H. E, Helgeson, Deputy Assistant Director, Mr. E. J. Pistey,
Mr. D. Ryan and a representative from the Senstudy 75 Project. ,

The Department ‘by: letter dated’ 8/7/75 requested a "™%r—
meeting with House Select Committee representatives to. arrange

for procedures for the. handling of requests. by that Committee.
The Department as of 8718/75. had not ‘received a response. ‘despit WY

the fact we had received requests from the Committee in writing
and also requests which were set, forth in the printed trans-
.eript for the” ‘hearings with the Select Committee on’ Intelligence
‘dated August: 7,°1975. We requested on’ 8/18/75. that the Depart-
ment ‘expeditiously. contact ‘the Committee to. determine when a
meeting could be ‘held with Committee representatives to discuss .
the aforementioned matters ‘including the ‘outstanding requests.
Steven Blackhurst, Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Co-
ordination, in turn advised a meeting was scheduled for 8/19/75
with ‘A. Searle Field, Staff Director.

The meeting was. held as ‘scheduled on’ 8/19/75 and in
attendance were Inspector John B. Hotis, SA Paul V. Daly and
SA Elmer Larson; Aaron Donner, Counsel, for the Committee; A.
Searle Field, ‘Staff Director; Richard Nermeire and Tim Oliphant ;

- Field stated at ‘the outset of the meeting that he
. did not accept nor would the Committee accept ‘the procedures
: concerning the production of. documents. ‘that. existed between
the Justice Department ‘and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Field and Donner. both expressed the opinion that these procedures
appeared to. be much too restrictive. - Field also stated that he’
wanted it. understood that ‘this was‘an investigation and that -
there would be no courtesies. extended. . He expressed his. dis-
pleasure at ‘the agreenient. existing between the Seriate Select -

the review. by FBI personnel of notes taken by Staff Members

from Bureau documents. and being told how in certain instances

to. handle information furnished. . He said there would be no
precensoring of any information by the FBI before it gets. :to

his Committee. He felt that a prior review would be intimidating
and self-defeating and would not permit his Committee to acquire
the facts it needs to conduct a thorough and compreherisive in-

. vestigation. As an example of the type of information he in-
tends. to obtain for. thé Committee,;. he. cited the identities of
informants. payment ‘schedules ‘to informants and access for
interview purposes to informants. His Committee ‘is interested
in the auditing procedures which ‘are employed and it may. be
necessary to recommend to the Congress that procedures. be es-
tablished which will enable the Congress to. exercise oversight -
in this'area. He said that tthe CIA is making their confidential
sources available to thé Committee Staff Members for interview
in some cases in "safe houses." - Field said that the Committee
Staff has no less authority. ‘than anyone in the FBI in these
matters and stands. coequal with them in the review of infor-
mants. The purpose of the interview of informants. by. the
Committee, according to Field, would be to. verify the payments.
made to” any particular informant ‘and to insure the taxes were
paid on that money.

A lengthy. discussion concerning the. existing pro-

. cedures. by. the’ Senate Select Committee and the FBI concerning
. documerit responses was. had with Field by. both Bureau and De+
partmental representatives. explaining to him the necessity
for a structured guideline for responses. It was apparent °

. that Field didnot ‘share the feeling that guidelines were
necessary in this area and reniarked that the did not want ‘to.

. be constrained by any formed agreement ‘in this area but ‘rather
handle the Committee requests on an ad hoc basis.’ He emiphasized

. that the was. under pressure ‘from individual Congressmen on the
Committee to show results. concerning requests, for information
from the’ FBI and his feéling was to date ‘that we had not been
responsive ‘on a timely. basis. Mr. Shaheen pointed out ‘to.
Field that :the Bureau had responded to certain other requests
and highlighted the ‘Department's request :of 8/7/75, for the
opportunity. to. discuss procedures and, guideline ; for future
Bureau responses -

RE: . HOUSTUDY

With respect ‘to interviews of current ‘and former
Bureau employees, Field was informed of the existing arrange-
ménts with the Senate Select Committee allowing a Bureau
representative ‘to be either present ‘and/or available for. con-
sultation if requested by. the proposed interviewee. . He was
also informed of the regulations ‘in the Department ‘and Bureau
which ‘require current and former employees to. be released for
purposes of interview. by Committee representatives. He was
also advised that we have generally. been informed in advance
of interviews: by Congressional Committees of the ideritities
of. current ‘and: former. eniployees who were to be interviewed and
of the ‘topic of the interview so that‘ ‘appropriate arrangements
. could be made ‘for such ‘an interview. - Field accepted these pro-
. cedures in principle;. however,. hé felt ‘that sin certain instances
the ‘Committee would. want :to. conduct “interviews without ‘prior
notification of. thé Buredu pointing out ‘that current or, former
. Bureau persomel might ‘desire to. be ‘interviewed without Bureau
kriowledge.

It was apparent ‘that. the Committee Staff Members of

. the House Select Committee ‘do not have expertise ‘on Bureau
operations that ‘is ‘enjoyed by thé Senate Select ‘Committee and
that ‘it would be to. our advantage to this. point ‘to. educate the -
Committee Members with regard to FBI operations and in so. doing

. hopefully making their requests reasonable. Since the prime ‘area
at ‘this point. based'on conversations with ‘Committeé ‘Staff Members

to be ‘informant ‘operations including audit’ procedures. ‘
ng payments. It would appear that’ a detailed briefing

. to the ‘Staff Members . :

At ‘the meeting it was agreed that with ‘regard to. the
| House ‘Select ‘Committee’ ‘request, for all materials furnished to"
the Senate Select Committee, that ‘the House Select Committed ’
would be ‘allowed access to: Such material and if they so..desire,
they would subsequent ju the material be delivered to the ©
committee. This is in accordance With ‘the. ‘decision made by. the”
Deputy. Attorney Gérieral as relayed to. the Bureau concerning thé
furnishing of material given'to the Senate Select ‘Committee ‘to.
the House Select Committed.

Subsequent ‘to the meeting, Steven Blackhurst ‘and
‘ Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., advised that ‘the Bureau should not pre-
pare responses. concerning the requests made of. Assistant’ Director
Walsh ‘during’ the hearing on August 7, 1975. It was the Depart-
‘menit's. intention at ‘this point sto request ‘that ‘the ‘Committee

A-memorandam from Michael ©. Shaheen, dr. x

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, dated August é. 1975, 2

~ requested our views concerning a request from the Hoge Soloct -
Committee for all materials and documents which we previously ch

provided to the Senate Select. Committee on Intelligence. For the

reasons set forth below, we believe that the Department shoaid not &
corply with this request. c

To begin-with, this request will add to the already
substantial administrative pardons imposed upon this Boreas by
various Congressional committees. Ve con also expect similar
demands by the House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional
Rights, chaired by Representative Don Edwards, and Lirs. ses fo
Subcommittee on Government Information and Individaal Rights. In
addition, the House Select Committes has asked for all documents
previously fornished the General Acconmting Office at the request of
the dadiciary Committee,

Although we are not suggesting that information be,
; withhold which Congress neéds to make appropriate oversight and
od legislative judgments, we feal that it should be sufficient that the
inforraation sought is provided one Committes in Congress. Otherwise,
‘we will soon be at the point where the effort needed to-comply ina.
Aue. De. complete and timely fashion to Congressional demands will seriously
ovr 4 Mn Hndermine the ability of this Bureax to darry out its normal investigative
Asst, Dies “_ Fogponsibilities.

dadge Dazclon, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia xvefused
to enforce a subpoena for Presidential tapes, on the grounds the Mouse
Judiciary Committee already had such tapes in its possession. Tints,

the [Senato] Select Committes's “inumediate oversight need for the
cubpoonacd tapes is, from a Congreccional porspective, merely
curaulative." To addition, tha court said, there was no skowin: that

7@ are alse concorned about the possibility of
compromising extremcly sensitive sources or ongoing inzectigations.
While we do not question the integrity of the ctoff members of thése
Committeos, the broad dissersination of these materials unavoidably
inercaces the Hielinead of improper diselocire,

An additional proniem is presented by Lule if of the
House Mules which provides that information furnished to a Committes
is available upon request to any member of the House. As you know,
ihule 7.3 of the Morse Uales for the Sclect Committee on Intelligence
Activities ctotes that, "Until such time as the Committee has cupraitted
its final voport to: the House, clasciticd or other sensitive information in the
Coraraitico records and files shall not be n:ade availavle or disclosed to
other than the Coxmittee mombership and the Committee staff, exeept
as being otherwise. doterzined by the Committee.” It is. not at all clear,
howover, whethor the Comraittce ules supersede established rales of
thelouca. Turthermore, Eulo 7.3 doag not doal with the altixate
disposition of cach materiale once the Committee has cubmitted ite final
report.

: For these veacons wa strously urge that Chairman Pike's
request for the mnterials provided the Senate Select Committes be denied—
We stand ready, of course, to respond to cpecific requocta fox information

They asked whether I could give ‘them a definition
of Counterintelligence and Internal Security.° I told them
that we could’ provide then a more detailed definition later
if they. liked but in’ general terms Counterintelligerice ©

. deals with countering the ‘efforts of ‘foreign intelligence

Internal Security deals ‘generally with ‘threats. or potential
threats. against ‘the’ United States. arising from groups ‘or

A discussion then, followed concerning how we
allocated our cost to the. various ‘programs’such as ‘those
included in the ‘fiscal year’ 1977 Spring Planning Call. An
explanation was given to’them of our manpower. utilization
surveys‘ and how this formed" the. ‘basis for. ‘the. ‘distribution

RE: . HOUSTUDY _

They. suggested that you might ‘have these statistics available
JM wheri you testified before the ‘Committee on’ 8/7/75, inasmuch as *
the Committee members might be interested in this.

They inquired as to. whether we have an accounting
= manual and account ‘code. “It was. explained ‘to them
that“ our’ accounting system is. undergoing revision in order to.
comply with GAO standards and that’ ‘our’ overall accounting a

manual has not been completed. They were advised that ‘the
payroll portion of the accounting system had ‘been approved

by. GAO on’6/30/75. They were advised that we ‘do. have a code"
book which'‘sets ‘forth ‘the. various accounts. and codes: A :
brief discussion took place concerning the request for informa-
tion in the Committee's letter. of 7/28/75: It was pointed ©
out ‘to. the’staff members ‘that ‘some of the questions were’so
non-specific and all-ericompassing’ that ‘they. could not possibly

. bé answered in a short period of time if at all. It was also
pointed’ out ‘to. then ‘that":some of the requests. were for informa-
tion that. even if: eventually.’ compiled would be of minimal

‘or. of no. usé“to them: “Some of ‘the. questions of ‘this ‘type were"
‘the ‘number. of payments to. the. informants. and the number. of © ~
informants with ‘a breakout of multiple paymerits.to a single
informant.. They said that what they. were ‘really. looking for
in-a question of this type was. that ‘as ‘of a given time we had
so many Organized Crime, General Criminal, Internal Security
or Counterintelligence’ ‘informants. and that cthey Were ‘paid a

. certain’ amount ‘of money. They indicated that if a question
were ‘stated in such ‘a’ way. that it were impossible ‘or extremely
difficult “to. answer we ‘should set that forth pointing out’.

what would’ be involved in responding to: the request so ‘that «
they. could make a decision as ‘to. requesting the ‘information in
a more ‘Limited: form.

They next inquired as ‘to. whether payments. to. general
eriminal or internal security. informants. would be larg You
responded that’ while all payments ‘are. different ‘since they ate on
a COD basis, it was your impression that -individual payments. to.

. criminal informants. would probably be larger and pointed’ out °
that ‘a criminal informant may furnish ‘information which ‘results. -
in a recovery amounting to several million dollars which would,

. because of ‘the ‘time ‘and money “saved in FBI efforts, entitle
him to“a‘rather substantial’ payment... They asked: how’ much an
agent..can pay to. an informant without getting approval, It. was~
explained to then none without any ‘approval’ and deperiding upon
the amount it would need SAC approval or approval’ from FBIHQ.

A brief and general. discussion took place of the

Post payment internal reviews are incorporated by the FBliinto the
accounting procedures followed for the handling of payments made to
informants. FBI Headquarters in Washington exercises central control
over these payments which results in every payment being reported
to and monitored by Headquarters, In addition, approvals are required by
field office supervisory personnel and these expenditures are audited by
the Inspection Division during their annual inspection of each field office.

The audit findings resulting from the audit work of the Inspection
Division disclose that these expenditures are fully documented, accurately

intended and the internal control over these payments is considered out-
standing. :

fiable payments that are achieving the purpose for which

offered by the FBI in any Bureau case since 1937, and this
Bureau does not request furids for this purpose. It should
‘be noted that the Attorney General, has the statutory authority
to pay rewards up to $25,000 for information or capture of
any person wanted for violation of criminal laws. In this
regard, on the specific instruction of Attorney General,
Robert F, Kennedy, a reward poster was issued by the
Department of Justice August 4, 1961, in the amount of
$10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone violating Federal statute in connection with
highjacking of an nireraft. This was a Departmental offer
and was not considered an FBI matter, :

Item J requests access to all payments and breakdowm
thereof made to persons outside the FBI with respect to
intelligence and counterIntelligence activities.

This is to inform that above-réequested information
is not readily available from payment records maintained by
this Bureau. Payments of this type made by Bureau field
divisions would be included in the monthly report submitted
by each field division, entitled "Confidential Funds and
Informant: Report! under the category of Miscellaneous
Expenditures, Similar payments could also have been made
by FBI Headquarters, In order to accurately respond toa this
request, all miscellaneous expenditures made by field divisions,
as well as by FBI Headquarters covering a designated period, _
’ would have to be manually séarched and compared with background
material relating to the authority for such payments. To be
responsive to request contained in Item I would involve an
extensive commitment of Bureali manpower and resources adversely
affecting ongoing and current operations.

DEFINITION

An individual who furnishes valuable information within our criminal
investigative jurisdiction or concerning other criminal matters of
interest to the Bureau +

ILLUSTRATION

This type informant includes members of the underworld, those who closely
associate with criminals or have intimate knowledge of criminal activities.
Typical examples of such persons are madams, prostitutes, pimps, fences,
con men, hijackers, robbers, burglars, hoodlums, gangsters,and those
individuals who associate with or have knowledge of such persons,

OBSERVATION 7

The listing of an individual 2s an approved Bureau informant is dependent

upon whether he or she can regularly furnish valuable criminal information,

In most instances 4n individual will be approved who has:

1. Furnished worth-while information in two or more Bureau cases

2, Furnished worth-while information in one Bureau case and better than
average information{relating to criminal intelligence investigations ]

3. Furnished worth-while information in at least one Buréau case and in
one other state or local case which is acted upon by the responsible
authorities so as to obtain corroboration of the. informant's report

4. Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in
one other Federal case which is acted upon by the interested Federal
agency, so as to obtain corroboration of the informant's report

DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

1. One of the most important responsibilities of an Agent is the identi~
fication of prospective criminal informants and the development of pros—
pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute
information to the Bureau,

2. Criminal informants are used to:

a. Solve cases

be Lovaic fugitives and wicnesses

C. Report cases we would not otherwise receive
a, Report plans to commit offenses

e. Advise of general criminal activities

3. Informants are developed from those who volunteer to be of assistance;
from subjects in cases investigated; from persons interviewed during
investigations; and from selected prospects who are clearly in a posi-
tion to obtain worth=while information, Their development frequently
requires patient, protracted effort to find a basis for persuading
them to cooperate in furnishing information.

4. Care must be exercised in attempting to persuade individuals to act as

. informants to avoid any allegations of undue influence, An individual
who is in custody and who offers to furnish information generally does
so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in return,

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity or any reduction in sentence
to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves
in a position where they might subsequently be accused of having done so.

5. Once an individual has started to cooperate and furnishes information
.of value, his continued cooperation can frequently be assured through
payments for services rendered and information furnished, There should
be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to informants who
supply substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain
the assistance.

6, Another important factor in the initial problem of getting a potential
informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treatment
sometimes generated during the handling of a case, Agents must be alert:
to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects and to capitalize on
them, Should a subject indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,
and should he be qualified to act as a real informant by virtue of his
background and associates, then affirmative action should be taken to re-
contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities,

osp . SECTION 108, CRIMINAL INFORMANTS i

7. %In the initial stages of developing en informant, background Gata
concerning him should be compiled, es outlined in section EB telo:
Once all of this information has been gathered together the +
to be used in persuading the prospect to act as an informant
depend upon the peculiar circumstances involved in the individual case
and upon the resourcefulness of the Agent endeavoring to develop the
prospect.

8. Bach field office must have criminal informants who do furnish infor-
mation concerning all types of offenses within the Bureau's investi-
gative jurisdiction, In addition, informants must be available to
furnish informetion concerning general criminal activities. Sack field
office's informant coverage must be regularly planned and a@justeg to
the changing volume of offenses occurring in clessifications, such as:

Theft from interstate shipment

Interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles

White Slavd Prafiic Act 7

Interstate transportation of stolen property

Bank robbery 5

Interstate transportation of obscene matter

Interstate transportation of lottery tickets

Gambling -

Gang activities

Politics in crime

9. The following list suggests other sources from which names of potential
informants may be secured.

a, Reports on general criminal activities
b. Major criminal cases
ce, Applications for restoration of civil rights (closea cases)
a, Modus operandi file of local police departments
e, Victims in White Sleve Traffic Act cases
f. Professional bondsmen
go Bartenders in lowe-class neighborhoods
h. Salesmen catering to prostitutes
i, Hebel exployces iu low-viass teighbsrhosds | }
je Complainants who contact Bureau offices under certain circumstances :
k, Operators of roadside taverns

10. After an informant has been developed, and unless some reason to the

contrary exists, his fingerprints are to be obtained if they are not

on file in the Identification Div me If the informant refuses, the

issue is not to be forced. The informant's fingerprints, obtained

solely fox this purpose, are to be removed from the criminal files when

the use of the inforriant is discontinued. A flash notice is to be placed

by the field in the files of the Identification Division by submission of

form FD-165, using informant's true name for each informant who has
fingerprints on files In order to eliminate the possibility of jeopardizing
the security of Bureau informants, the word "Informant" should not be
indicated in blank ballot box on FD-165. It should be noted the informant
file number serves as an indication to the Identification Division of the
type of flash notice desired.

(Do not use form FD-9 to request an identification record on informant;

FPD-165 is to be used for this purpose.) The informant's FBI Identification

Record number should be included in the Secure Teletype designating a

symbol number informant, Informantts fingerprints, when obtained, should

be forwarded as enclosure to FD-165 using applicant-type fingerprint card,

PD-258. This card should be properly executed showing subject's complete

description, including dete and place of birth. Appropriate field office

should be shewn as contributor, field case file num number space,
and "inquiry" in space for "company and address" on face of card, The
flash should be removed when the, informant is discontinued by submission
of FD-165,.

ll. When subjects in Bureau cases are sentenced to the penitentiary, consider-
ation shoulda be given to the possibility that these subjects may be used
as criminal informants upon their discharge, If there are any possibilities
of eventually developing one or more subjects as potential informants upon
their release, forward a letter to the Bureau requesting thet a stop
notice be placed with the Bureau of Prisons so that the appropriate office
will be advised of the subject's release. The procedures to be followed
in requesting that such a stop. notice be placed are set out in Section
8, part I. Manual of Rules and Regulations, under the heading "Stop
notice.#'"“Upon notification of subject's release, steps can then be
taken ‘to attempt to develop him as a criminal informant.

12. (Requests of informant to help defend others
ae If requested to assist in preparation of defense in criminal-type

cases or handle assignment where such information is readily

[ available, informant should tactfully decline.
be Such requests should be reported immediately to contacting Agent

and made a matter of record.
c. If informant cannot avoid becoming involved, instruct him not to

report any information pertaining to defense plans or strategy.

d. Promptly report any such incident to Bureau.

e. If an informant is present in conversation between an attorney

- and individual under criminal indictment, he should immediately
leave. If he is unable to do so and inadvertently learns of defense
plans or strategy, he is not to report the substance of any such
conversation to the FBI. Additionally, the informant is not to
engage in or report the substance of a conversation with a criminal
defendant dealing with the offense for which the defendant is under
indictment.

f. Hach handling Agent must orally advise the informant of the above, .
reduce it to writing and record it in the informant's file.

of the U. S. Boar€ of Parole. While this procedure would not preclude
accepting information from these persons, payments for information

should not be made without prior Bureau approval, Once the period of
parole has expired, these individuals may be considered for development.

ant will continue to be listed for a reasonable period. This continued
listing will depend upon:

items to be completed on this form, all of which must be answered
either through the insertion of the appropriate figure, or by the
use of the word "none" if no accomplishments were recorded.

b. Administrative accomplishments
Under item 2 list the symbol numbers of informants added and under
item 3 list the symbol numbers of informants deleted. Do not list
or count any informants added or deleted after the 25th of the
month for which prepared. These informants should be listed and
counted in the next monthly progress letter submitted.

ce. Statistical accomplishments

Every statistical accomplishment which can be credited to criminal

informants or potentiel criminal informants must be reported in

the first monthly progress letter submitted after the accomplishment |

took place. Set out as, follows:

Opposite items 6-10 list the total number of ‘subjects in each
category who were arrested or located as a result of information
furnished by criminal informants, or potential criminal informants,
during the month. Item 7 is included in the total of item 6.

Item 8 is not included in the totels of either items 6 or 7.

and "Other Federal Matters." Under each category will be listed in
three columns the criminal informant symbol number or potential crim-
inal informant symbol number, the title and character of the case, and
the nature of the statistic being credited to the informant (such as
"subject arrested" or "fugitive apprehended” or "subject located" or
"$700 stolen watches recovered"). If, as in the case of local, state,
or other Federal violations, there is no case title, this information
may be omitted; however, the description of the statistic should
dnolude enough information to identify the type of violation (such as
"John Green arrested for local burglary" or "$475 stolen hams recovered
from local burglary"). If two or more statistics result from one in-
formant on one case, list the statistics separately opposite the in-
formant (such as "subject arrested on narcotics charges $700 narco~

Cc inal informants must be advised that they are not Bureau em;
It must be recognized that many such informants ere also crimina.
considerable care must be exercised in dealing them so they
not become aware of and have the opportunity to obstruct the Bureau's ¥
Arrangements must be worked out so thet at least two Agents are in a p05:
tion to contact each criminal informant. For a short time after an inform-
ant is first developed, it may sometimes be necessary to have one Agent make
2ll contacts. However, a program must be established and actually started
within six months after the informant is developed to establish a working
arrangement so that a second Agent can contact such an informent., If any
situation arises in which this cannot be done, the Bureau must be informed.
Consideration should be given to the assignment of specific projects to
g00d informants, particularly those who have had little current opportunity
to furnish information because of 2 temporary lull in criminal activity

in the area in which the informant is utilized.

All informants end potential informants should be contacted as often

as necessary, but at least one personal contact should be made every

thirty days, unless there is some substantial reason for not doing so.
Information from informants of interest to another Government agency must

be furnished to that agency. When information is passed on to local or
other investigative agencies, or acted upon by the Bureau, the identity

of the informant must be fully protected, 7

on a criminal informant. The danger to be recognized and guarded against
is that routine, everyday contacts with criminal informants will result

in a relaxing of our vigilance to protect int ants. It must always

be remembered that one slip or one misstatement may cause a criminal inform—
ant to be killed. i

Where prosecution is contemplated in a riatter in which information has

been received from an informant and the USA can give no a rance of his
ability to protect the informant's identity, no further acticn is to be
taken until the Bureau can be advised and the case can be discussed w:
the Department.

Informants should furnish informeat:

ion to the Bureau exclusively. If under
ecessary to furnish information to
representat: r agency or organization, be cervain that they
will first advise the Bureau of their intention to do so.
Informants should confine themselves to matters within the Bureau's primary
investigative jurisdiction so.far as it is possible to do so and should
-not become involved in procuring evidence regarding violations not within
the Bureau's primary investigative jurisdiction, Debrief 211 informants
and sources on at least a monthly basis regarding their knowledge of
naxcotics activities.
Criminal informants should be cultivated on Government reservations when
the investigative problems warrant this action but do not develop inform-
ants among active duty military personnel.
The office supervising an informant must furnish to any other office
using him a summary of information as to the informant, such as de-
scriptive data, mode of travel, criminal background, an up-to-date
identification’ record, and any other information pertinent to the
assignment.
All pending informant files are to be reviewed personally by appro
priate supervisory personnel on a regular periodic basis not to exceed
iy days. This review must include the informant's file and its sub-
iles. 7

K, DEPARTMENT POLICY AND OPINIOW
The Department has issued instructions to tell all USAs that informants of
the Bureau shall not be interviewed or subpoenaed without prior consent of the
Department. Any deviation from this policy showlad be immediately brought to
the Bureau's attention. :

On 7-10-52 the Department furnished an opinion regarding the question whether
an informant could be prosecuted for technically violating the law while
attempting to obtain evidence regarding a Federal violation, The Department
stated ",.,If the intent throughout was to assist the government agents in
the enforcement of the law, and not to violate or to ‘cover-up! for a vio-
lation of the law, it is not believed a case for prosecution could be made
against such an informer...."

"The procedures té be followed by informers working under the supervision

of your agents in the aid of enforcing the statutes coming within your jurisdic—
tioh largely rests upon your sound discretion....It is not believed that an
informer would be otherwise immune from prosécution for actions which would
subject a Federal enforcement officer to prosecution. * :

L. TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM .

1. The top echelon criminal informant program is aimed specifically at developing
informants who can provide a continuous flow of quality co inal intelli-
gence information regarding the leaders of organized criminal activity
throughout the nation. It is directed at developing informants in the
following categories:

a. Informants who are members of La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

b. Informants who can furnish significant information regarding other
organized criminal groups i

c. Informants at the top level of organized gambling activity who can
provide information that will enable the Bureau to effectively
enforce the anti-gambling statutes

4, Tulessiauts who can produce accurate and authentic data regarding the
extent of graft and corruption in each sector of the nation

e. Informants who can furnish information which will enable the Bureau
to prosecute the hoodlum hierarchy

2, The development of informants who can provide information of this caliber

is mandatory to insure the Bureau meets its commitments.

This program calls for the selection of targets for development. The

selection should be based upon 2 combination of a particular hoodlun's

i qualifications by virtue of his position in the organized hoodlum element
and upon circumstances indicating his possible susceptibility to development,
To insure maximum security for an individual under development, he should
be assigned a symbol number immediately upon being designated for attention.
The symbol number for these individuals should be followed by the suffix
PC to insure that they will be distinguished from regular criminal
informant. The Bureau should be promptly advised whenever an individual
is added or deleted from your program .

| 4. When reauesting authority to add a target, include sufficient data in

C a(UACBlcommunication to indicate(that]the individual is e logical

\ oC . choice for inclusion in your program. {For purposes of security, this

initial communication should always be transmitted by secure teletype and

shouldjinclude such data regarding the proposed target as a complete

description,[a summary of hislarrest record, and information indicating

that{he has Jaocess to significant information[concerning]top level '

racket figures, Insure that the program is not diluted by requesting

I authority to add targets who{should Jmore appropriately be considered PCIs.

5. A penstrative investigation of each individual selected as a target

should be conducted prior to any approach of the individual. After
completion of the penetrative investigetion, request the Bureau to approve
the interview of the target. The letter requesting such authority should

| set forth the approach to be utilized in the interview. A full exploi-

| tation must be made of any circumstances which plece a target ina

to develop each target designated fcr attention. Include pesitive orma—
tion in summary form and also set forth your contemplate? plan to effect
the cooperation of the target. In subsequent communications point out the
result of ection taken and in the event your contemplated plan was not
productive or feasible, advise of your alternate plan. Also include the
specific number of times the top echelon source was contacte
alternate Agent as well as the Agent to whom the case is assi
forth data regarding corroboration of the source's informeticn

8. A letter should be directed to the Bureau when an individual under
development furnishes sufficient information to qualify him es a top
echelon informant. This letter should follow the sa format us to
designate regular criminal informants, and the suff: of the symbol number
should be changed to C-TE in accordance with subsection G, item 12, of
this section,

9, Every effort must be made +o insure the potential of each top echelon
informant is fully utilized to the Bureau's advantage. 3e particalari
alert to the possibility of utilizing information from membe

10. Justification letters are to be submitted regarding top echelon inforn~
ants, except those on a regularly paid status, on a triannual basis.
Offices Albany through Newark should forward these letters by February 1,
June 1, and October 1. Offices New York through Washington Field should
submit these letters March 1, July 1, and November 1. Prepare these
letters in the same manner as annual letters for regular criminal inform-
ants. 7

11. Following the initial teletype communication, care should be exercised to
make certain that subsequent communications to either the Bureau or other
field offices containing information which may jeopardize the intornmant's
identity are sent by secure teletype.

12. As in the payment of criminal informants, SAC may approve advances to top
echelon infornants or targets undex development for expenses in obtaining
information, for the performance of services, or for information on @
C.0.D. basis up to $400 initially. Several paynents or advances nay be
made under this same authority until the sum such payrients or advances
aggregates $400. [All future requests f. 1 of i
pay top echelon infornants and targets in the Top Ec’
Informant Program should be submitted to the Bureau on a ' 3
seven calendar days" basis. All_additional authorizations should be
requested in increments of $600.

13. For other regulations concerning the handling of top echelon criminal
informants and targets, be guided by instructions set out above for
regular criminal informants.

M. PARTICIPATION OF AGENTS
On‘March 32 of each year furnish the Bureau a list of Agents in the office
who have been assigned to criminal investigative matters 50 percent or
more of the time during the previous year (excepting Agents assigned
primarily to eccounting investigations) and have not developed az in
or have not effectively operated an informant, during the sa 2

they previously developed. The SAC is to provide an analysis of each 1
Agent's performance and furnish as an’attechment to the list explanations
secured from all listed Agents, along with recommendations for administrative

action.

PROVIDENCE

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time
.of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the
continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential
fund and the submission of monthly reports in connection vherewith,

You are aware, of course, that under “exist ing Bureau regu-
lations it is absolutely essential’ that-an appropriate statement be
submitted at.the end oF each month reflecting the condition of the
confidential. fund in each field office, including therein its status
with-respéct to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements which
have been fade during the current accounting period. -

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub- if
mit such nonthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it
yi increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's
records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurate
record upon the vasis of which the accountability of each Special
Agent in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at
the Bureau over-a veriod of time reflects an increasing number of pay- a
ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-
ants. The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies
and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10
to $20. At the time the monthly-statement is submitted by the field
office involved, such statements invariably fail to indicate that the
expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts
of which are to te subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-
stances-they are improperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

‘NW 55321 DocId:32989713 Page 150

"NW 55321 Docld:32589713 Page 151 <

-of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

where field offices fail to submit non-expendadle receiving slips,

spect thereto.

an accurate accounting on the part of the Sureay int

For your guidance in the preparation of future monthly .
reporte concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being
enclosed herewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly
the manner in which disbursements, advances, refunds; or purchases -
are to be listed. All subsequent monthly statesients prepared by 7
your office should be submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases 7
Special Agents have not been sut ~g receipts to justify the
expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue
slips. For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-
odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-
ceipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such
items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of
a money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-
ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren+
dered by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

items of a related nature where a receipt could. reasonably be secured.
7 Although the Bureau is necessarily aware of the fact that
receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-
gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,
nevertheless, it must insist that such rec is be obtained for
confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise
practicable to do so. Hereafter, confidential items will be sus-
pended from the accounts in question ess the expenditures in-
volved are: properly supported by the necessary recéipts.

__. Likewise, the Bureau has noted ‘with considerable concern
increased purchases in the form of furniture, bedding, clothing, and |
related items utilized in the conduct of various plants and other zs
confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-
nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-
sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken
up properly on the field office inventories. Accordingly, it is
desired that you forward to the Bureau in the near future a detailed
report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased
and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried
on the Bureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be
maintained simultaneously by cach of the respective field offices
having control, custody, or possession of such equipment. With
reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will
be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of :
appropriate non-expendable receiving slips. Such slips should indi-
cate that the item was purchased through the submission of blue
slips. The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted
and suspensions from the vouchers will be made in those instances



«+ Accordingly, ig desired that the non-expend, seceiving slips |

‘ - covering curch Ds of furniture: bedding, and r equipment by 7
blue slips, be attached to the voucher when it is submitted for

payment.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein
your immediate personal attention and supervision: It is expected 7
that in the future there will be strict compliance with the foré-
going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

7 : cies may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

RE; ACPIVITIES OF TEE
CONFIDENTIAL FUND

7 The Bureau is desirous at the present time of bringing to your attention
the absolute necessity for the careful handling of expenditures from the Con-
fidential Fond and the submission of monthly reports in connection therewith,

You are aware that under existing Bureau regulations it is absolutely
essential that an appropriate statement be submitted at the end of each month
reflecting the condition of the Confidential Fund in each field office, including
therein its status with respect to the cash balence on hand, pius disbursements
which have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in ‘the past failed to submit such
nontkiy stetexents promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly
@ifficult to properly audit the Bureau's records in cormection therewith. As
set out in SAC Letter No. 23, dated April ky 1950, ell Confidential Fund reports
should be received at the Bureat no leter shan the 20th of the following ranth.

” For your guidence in the preparation of future ronthly reports concern-
ing Confidentiel Fund expenditures. there is enclosed a sample form which outlines
briefly the proper method of prepa: g@ the report. In addition, there is enclosed
@ sample form which outlines the metiod which should be used to summarize the .

> payments to informants and confidential sources. In this regard your attention
is directed to Section (A), SAC Letter No, 23, deted April 4, 1950, which i's
revised in that’ the Atomic Energy informants should be deleted from the report.
The swrary should now reflect paynents to Criminal and National Defense
Confidential Sources. :

mann i It has veProies that in a, great number Stances Special Agents
have not deen sutmitting receipts to. justify the experditures for which re-
“‘imbursements are being clein ae through blue slips. The Bureau is aware of the
fact that receipts cannot be secured in each end every instance, due to
exigencies peculiar to certain types of activities, nevertheless, receipts
should be obtained wherever possible. .

In connection with the preparation of the blue slips it hes been
noted that some are being prerared too much in detail, In those instances. where
the paynent is made to an authorized reguler paid informant, the following
information is ‘sufficient to support the cleim:

1. Amount of payment
2. Name and syzibol number of informant
° 3. Case
; hk, Date of authorization letter or teletype
5. Period of paynent

A semple form reflecting the proper method for preparing | a blue slip
is ihieinaanein3 : 5

~ The Bureau has also noted in many instences that Agents, when re-
claiming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the voucher that the item was
suspended from a previous voucher, It is pointed out that no reference should
be nade to the previous voucher nor should the Agent state that the item was
suispended unless he forwards the original Stetement of Difference with the
voucher.

}
}

Your attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a
limited amount of funds available to operate the Confidential Funés of the
field divisions, therefore, you should wake every effort to operate on your
present fund, It is pointed out that a more frequent submission of Confidential
Fund youchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the fund,

File No. June 9, 1954 WASHINGTON 25, D.C,

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND
ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES -
FBI FORM BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures
presently being followed” by the various field divisions which were
forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Parag zraphn D;
and from a review of the sugzestions submitted along with these
reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling:
the operations of the Confidential Funds maintained by the various
field divisions should be established, :

Effective July 1, 195h,° the following accounting
procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining
a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number’ One shall be
used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of
the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that
“would affect this fund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the flnd,

b, Refunds of all or part of payments made to an
informant for which the office has been reimbursed by
the Bureau. :

‘ att ce. Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases
and refunds received from the informants in cases
similar to "b" above. 7

This ledger page should also reflect a “pupning balance
of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.
This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount, to
be accounted for.

2. "A cash receipts and disbursements page. shall be
utilized to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total
fund. This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample
(Exhibit Number Two), which reflects examples of various transactions
which will affect the Fund. This ledger should be retained indefi- | ~
nitely and.should be used as the basis for the preparation of the anu

NW 55321 Docld:32989713 Page 173



"NW 55321 Docld:32989713 Page i74

_monthly report. All columns should be ruled off at the end of the

calendar month and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number
One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements. The debit
side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from
the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau. All payments made
to criminal informants and sources should be reflected in the
column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security infcrmants

or sources should be reflected in the column captioned “Security;"
and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either
of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone
companies, taverns, restaurants, vost office box: rental, etc.,
should be reflected in the column captioned "Hiscellaneous, " The
eredit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds
from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous
payment. was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous nature.’

-Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;

checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases
shouid be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas any © ~*
refund from an informant, scurce or of a miscellaneous nature which
must be returned to the Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the "Refunds" column, Like-
wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be
recorded here, (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.)

: In view of the foregoing,.you will note that for every
entry in the Cash Disbursements cclumn, there should be a corre-
sponding entry in one of the debit columns, i.e., in either the
Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to
Bureau column, Likewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts
column, there should be a corresponding entry in‘one of the credit
columns, i.e., in either the Refunds: of Payments column or in badly
Receipts from Bureau column.

— It is to be further noted that the totals of Column
Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "Sum-
mary of Payments to Informants" in connection with the monthly
report. The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by
subtracting the total of the credit side of Column Oné from. the
total of the debit side of this column,

-3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each

‘paid informant and for each paid confidential sources. This section
of the ledger should be divided into three parts; namely, Criminal,
Security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a
separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid
criminal confidential source. ‘he Security section should reflect

SAC LETTER 54-G i

s + t



‘NW 55321 DécId:32989713 Page 175

a separate page for each paid security informant and each paid
confidential seurce. Under the Miscellaneous section, pages
should be set up fer rental of space for plants or surveillances,
regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the Confidential
Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regular
‘basis, Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-
rants, rental of safe a sit boxes, etc., may be included ona
single page as the expe ures ceme up. A sample of an informant
page is attached (Exhibit Number Three). It is to be noted that
this page reflects the following information:

. the date of authorization
» the authorization

.« period covered by payment
. Gate of payment

» amount of payment

.0A8 TW

: In connection with the date of euthorization, you are
instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter
to the field division in cases where authorizaticn is made by
Bureau letter and the date of the incoming letter when authorization
is made by stamping "approved" on a tickler copy of a letter
received from the field division requesting authority,

Before making any disbursements from the Confidential
Fund to an informant, the authorigaticn should be checked ts be
sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and that the
period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing
authorization, These authorizations should be posted in the
ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau. In connection
with SAC authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment
is being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's
file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to’ that

*date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954;
form FD-228 shculd be removed from your'form book and your supply
destroyed,

4, After a careful review of the many suggestions received
in response to SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-
ing funds from the Confidential Fund has been designed, a copy of
which is attached, You may print a supply of this fcrm for use in
your office, -FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have
been avpreved for your office. A copy of FD-235 is to be placed in
the FBI Form Book. This form should be prepared in duplicate by
the Agent requesting the funds, and after approval by the Agent
Supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the Sac for his approval

6/9/54
NO” NUMBER
SAC LETTER NO, 54-a

4 : Seabee te



before any disbursement is made from the Confidential Fund. After
approval of the form by the SAC and after the employee handling

the disbursements from the fund has‘carefully verified that the 7
payment is in accordance with existing authority, one copy of the

-form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an eccounts receivable file which should be
divided into two sections; namely, an unvouchered file ard a
vouchered file. These forms can be used by the employee responsible
for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue
slips for submission wo the Bureau. Of ccurse, these blue slips
should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the
informant is obtained from the Agent making the ‘payment, and in
those ‘cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the
Agent making the payment. At the time the voucher is prepared, those
forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be
attached to the tickler copy of that vcucher after it has. been
prepared and retained in the accounts receivable file until reim-
bursement is made by the Bureau. At the time reimbursement is
received, the voucher should be removed together with the attach-
ments and a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement
was received from the Bureau. The Request for Funds forms attached
to the voucher may then be destroyed. In the event an item has
been'suspended from the voucher and returned to the field office,
it would be necessary to remove the Request for Funds form from

the voucher on which she blue slip wes requested and returned to
‘tthe unvouchered file until such time as it is resubmitted or it is
determined it will not be resubmitted,

: 5. Monthly Report. As you are aware, the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared
and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month following
the period ‘during which the expenditures were made. These reports
should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

. the present form for this report have been suggested and after a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the
reports should be prepared in accordancé with the attached example
(Exhibit Number Five). he monthly report submitted to the Buréau

" should be prepared under the direct supervision of the Special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly
Gesignated Field Supervisor. he fund should be audited once: each
six months, on June 30 and December 31, This audit shall be
personally performed by a Special Agent Accountant. The report, of
this audit shall te forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of -
duly and the twentieth day of January. In those instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training
and Inspection Division during a, regular inspection, the next

+ regular six months! audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the Field Division.

With regard to the summary of expenditures section of
the Confidential Report, it is desired to illustrate the following
points: aa :

a. All transactions during the calendar
month should be shown. : :

Db. All items should be listed in order by
date and by check number. poe

: e. -The explanaticn should reflect the
. hame and symbol number of the informant as
well as the period covered by the payment and
7 “in case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief
statement to describe the expenditure.

ad. Any transaction that affects the
total amount of the fund to be accounted for o.
must be fully explained in a cover memoran- te
.dum. An example of such a transaction would
be a refund received from an informant for
payment which had already been reimbursed by
the Bureau. Any such refund, if not already
forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted
with the report.

In connection with the summary of payments to infermants.
you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed
separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-
tion, This breakdown should include such payments as post office
box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank
charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for
prisoners, etc, In other words, all payments not. made to informants
or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or
expenses incurred by them should be included under miscellaneous

+. expenditures, : :

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed: out here-
tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds
form with the exception that the date of actual patment toithe
informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be
obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt
obtained from the informant. A blue slip should be prepared at
,such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been
received from the Agent making the payment. 7 z

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but
should contain sufficient information ‘to allow the Bureau to make
@ proper review of the expenditures. Samples are attached
reflecting payments made to informants under Bureau authority

NW 55321 DocTd:32989713 Page,177 ..”



(Exhibit Number Six), SAC authority (Exhibit Number Seven), and
miscellaneous expenditures (Exhitit Number Eight), These samples
are general but should be used as a guide for preparing all blue
slips. In addition to the attached samples, it is desired that
the following be kept in mind in connection with the preparation
of blue slips:

&. One blue slip should be used for each
payment. It is not desired to have numerous
payments listed on a single blue slip in view
of the possibility of error which would result
in the necessity of suspending the entire blue

7 slip; whereas if only cne payment were listed
on the blue slip, it would be possible to re-
turn only tne one item and the remaining items
could be processed for payment, «3

b. The authority must be clearly reflected ~
‘on the blue slip. When authority is based on
: the letter from the Bureau, actual date cf the
} * Bureau letter shall be used as the date of the
authorization, Then the field office, by letter,
requests authorization and receives notice that
authorizaticn has been granted in the form of a
copy of the field office letter returned by the
Bureau with the Bureau approval stamped therecn,
the date of the authorization in this instance
shall be the actual date of the field office let~
ter to'the Bureau requesting the authorization.

e. The actual period of time covered by the
payment to the informant must be reflected in the
body of the blue slip, For example, see "Period"

-reflected in body of Exhibit Number Six. It is
also essential that the neried covered be carefully
compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent
exceeding the Bureau authorization, bcth by time
and amount, Receipts should be obtained whenever
possible. In instances where they are not obtained
either because of the refusal of the informant to
execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain
one, the appropriate notation should be reflected
on the blue slip.

ad,” FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the
Agent reflecting receipt of money from the SAC is
only to be used when ‘the receipt signed by the
rs informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

6/9/54
NO NUMBER i
SAC LETTER NO, 54~-G “6+ :



e, In all instances where the receipt signed
by the informant reflects vayment was made to him
by the Special Agent in Charge, reimbursement must
be claimed on a voucher of the Special Agent in _
Charge. If the receipt reflects payment was madé
to the informant by the Assistant Special Agent in
Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed ona
voucher of the Assistant Special Agent in Charge.
In instances where the receipt reflects that payment
was made to the informant by someone ovher than the
Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Special Agent
in Charge or where there is no payor designated, the

Pal blue slip may be submitted for payment on the

7 voucher of either the Special Agent in Charge

or the Assistant Special Agent in Charge. When
the receipt reflects that payment was made by a
person other than the one claiming reimbursement,
Form FD-221 must be executed and attached to the~
-blue slip. It is advisable to have the inform-
ant's: receipts’ executed in the name of the
employee actually making payment or in blank in
order that the Special Agent in Charge or the
Assistant Special Agent in Charge may claim
reimbursement.

£, The Blue slin should not reflect the
number of the check issued and no reference
should be made on the blue slip to the inform-
ant's- field file number,

: g. All blue slips submitted on the monthly
expense vouchers of Special Agents must bear the
‘approval of the Special Agent in Charge; however,
the Special Agent in Charge may delegate authority
to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or an
approved field office supervisor to sign his name
as approving official fcllowed by. the initials of
the Assistant Special Agent in’ Charge or the
supervisor, .

h. Receipts obtained by personnel which
reflect payments to informants and sources should
reflect the ACTUAL DATE payment is made to the
informant or source. The receipt should in no 7 :
instance reflect any other date. The Receipt
should also show the EXACT AMCUNT paid to the
informant or source, ‘and every Special Agent sub-
mitting receipts should thoroughly understand
this -procedure.

i, All vouchers containing blue slips must
be forwarded to the Bureau addressed to Assistant
Directcr, Administrative Division, Attention:
Voucher Unit. They must be sent via‘ registered
mail, return receipt requested and cannot be
intermingled with other mail. Confidential Fund
monthly reports should also be submitted in this
manner to the Bureau, -

7. Miscellaneous, It is desired to bring the following
miscellaneous items to your attention:

. a, When submitting blue slips ‘covering
payments to informants from another field
division, the informant should be identified
on the blue siip by indicating his name, symbol
number and field division. :

7 b. The words Confidertial Fund should never
be mentioned on a blue slip. When claiming for
bank charges, the blue slip. should reflect pay-
ment to an official of the bank by name for serv-
ices rendered, en .

|

c. Payments under the authorization of the
SAC are limited to $200.00 to criminal informants
and sources; and to $100.00 to security informants
and sources, This maximum is considered as all
payments made to an individual regardless of the
length of time between payments. Once'an inform-
ant has been paid under Bureau authority, pay-
ments cannot be made under the authority of the
SAC even in instances where the informant has been

_discontinued as a regularl paid informant.

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES -- I want to draw to you
the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential
expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with exi ting Manual
provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for
every dollar expended, Although it is the personal responsibility
of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of Seat
of Government employees to be judicious in authorizing expenditures
fo be made and to practice preper eeconsiy, rs

props.

For your information, Inspectors will, “in each field
office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue
slips to determine the propriety of each expenditure and will trace
through the files information received and results obtained,
following the enditure and, if necessary, follow it throt
with appropriate employee interviews with the underst
in the event an expenditure is encountered which -is. not proper
the employees involved will reimburse the Government,

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -
ACCOUNTING PRCCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which
set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of
the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which at
is felt will eliminate oa ne duplication of work in connection
with the establishment. of these accounting procedures. The sug-
gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining
whether payments to informants on SAC authority are in excess
of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.60
“amount for security infcrmants, It was suggested that the in-
formants! files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,

a . 1954, be entered on the informants! individual ledger pages,
This would apply only to payments made under SAC authority, :

7 It is felt that this suggestion will save eonside reble
time and work in the field, and ycu are accordingly instructed .
to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting
procedure,

Very truly. yours,

* John Edgar Hoover

may be complete in the event this envelope should become separated

BLUE SLIPS

Mane In the preparation of future blue slips, the
. - following instructions should be adhered to:

The blue siips should show the correct name of

the individual being paid. Any difference between this and
7 the name used by the informant .in signing a receipt for
: : payment must be explained on the blue slip. When a name
other than the individual's full correct name is:used in
Anitial development as an informant, his full correct name
should be used on the blue slip as soon as it is known,
together with references to the previous names used in
contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure is necessary to enable the
Burean fo properly coutsol payments and to make sure that
all payments to one individual are consolidated. It has
been noted in some instances that blue slips are submitted
showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are
submitted showing the individual's middle name as a last
“name. This is especially true in connection with Spanish
names, This practice leads to the possibility of carrying
& separate account of payments under each name.

Fake sure that the necessary employees of your
office are aware of this and the‘need for consistency.

In addition, where an informant or individual
Imown to have been formerly contacted by another division
is paid by your division, the blue slip claiming reimburse-
ment should refer to the fact that he is formerly from the
other division. This is necessary to insure that the
Bureau's accounts of payments are properly credited for
payments made,

The Bureau has noted that in many instances the
: field is not following instructions concerning the forward-
2 hg of vouchers containing confidential items (blue slips)
to the Bureau. The Fanual of Rules and Regulations, Part II,

‘ 8/12/58
. SAC LETTER NO. 58-47 ee

Section 7, Subsection A, Item 2a, (2), provides that all
vouchers containing confidential blue slips must be sent

by Registered Mail, Return Receipt Requested, the inner
envelope addressed to the Assistant Director, Administrative
Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Attention Voucher
Unit, Monthly reports of confidential expenditures must be
handled in the same manner. The envelope should not be
marked Personal and Confidential. You should bring this
matter to the attention of all employees responsible for
handling the mailing of these items.

’ MONTHLY REPORTS OF CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES

In examining the above-captioned reports, the
Bureau has noted that- the field is not being consistent
in the way the expenditures are summarized on ‘the last
. page. Some reports include payments made to PCIs or PSIs
with those to "Sources." Payments to PCIs or PSIs should
be included with "Informants" and not with "Sources." Only
those ‘payments made to Confidential Sources, Panel Sources,
and Sources of Information should be .included under
"Sources" in the summary. Kake sure that the persons
responsible for the preparation and review of the report
are aware of the above...
