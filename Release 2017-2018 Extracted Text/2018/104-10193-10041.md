1, Ray-did not return to Washinjtoa uatil early morning on Friday,
12 May 1961. He called me at 0700 from the airport. Ha was unable
to fix a definite hour for us to get-together due to the fact that he was

“expecting an appointment with.a person he did not namé some time

during thé morning. He latarealled-a number of times from the Hotel
Ambassador to ‘advise me that be still had had. no word on his appoint~
ment. As 1145, Mir, Betancourt called to say that he was with Ray
and “Eugenio” (Rogelio Claneroa) and could we get-together: “1 sug
geated they drive out to the Clarendon Hotel Court on Wilson Boulevard
where I had taken a room for holding our mecting. They arrived in
Mr, Betancourt's cer at approximately 1230 novn iime aud we fizat
went to the nearby Hogate. Restaurant oo Wilson Boulevard for lunch
bofore we got down to the business of the prospectua.

2. ° During lunch we did not discuss the plas but I'did take the op-
portunity to strass in a most serious way the need for absolute secrecy
concerning our discussions today and any future discussions or devel-
opmwnts which might take place in the future with respect to our relation-
ship. All agreed on the need for tight security.

},. After lunch we drove to the Hote] Court and from approximately
1330 untit 1730, we discussed the prospectus. Using Mr, Barnes! out-
Nee aa a general guido, I stressed the importance of being able to present

y

ey



to the proper people at the earliest possible time a carefully thought- ,
out plain of action which ‘would-set forth clearly the objectives += what
the project hoped to achieve; a statement of the problem: the etrengthe
of the Castro regime following the ill-fated invasion; the status of the
underground and its morale and capadilisies; the extent of internal
support for aad diccontent with the rogima, etc., ete.

4. Lalso spoke of the neod for describing the kind of activities
which the Ray organization planned to engage in and the assets and
capabilities which thay have or Can.acquire todo the Job. The need for”
explaining the rejationship and coordinatioW of the plan with the Revoli-
tlonary Council discussed at some length, :

5. -Leuggested that he include in the plan an itemization of the kinds
of support which he would expect us to supply immediately ao well as the
kind and quantity of support which would be required of us as tha project

developed.

6. Talso.ouggested that the plan include their views on how U.S,
Maisun and coordination could beat be worked out; how funds would be

funneled:into the’ projact; whist commo and other training would be re-
quired; whether U, &. "real estate" would be needed, otc,

7, Ray oatlined sonze of hie thoughts regarding his proposed plan
of action. According to him it contemplates action in three broad fields:

(a) Underground activity -. principally sabotage -- in the
urbaa areas,

{b) Gradua) buildup -- rargely through clandestine infiltra-
tons of amail bodies of men -- of guerrilla forces in mourtain-
ous aad defensible areas,

fe) A psychclosical warfare campaizn within Cuba and abroad
aimed at discrediting Castro and at the same time providing the
people of Cuba something to fight for,

&. it is Ray's intention to depend almost entirely on maritime operas
tlons for the infiltration of personnel and materie! into Cuba, He also
rules out of his plan the creation of another invasion army but does con-
template the tritaing of groups of perhaps up to 150 men in other (riendiy |



aaa

countries of South America (he meatiuned Venezuela as a-possibility)
and saidhe would explore the possibility of basing maritima operations
in noa-U. S. porta,

9. Ray sffd'some means, other than Swan Island, must be found
{or reaching the Cuban pepulatioa by radio broadcasts, He spoke of
the possibility.of short wave broadcasts from Venesuela and utiliza
tion of a commercial station is Miami which he understands con bé
elearly heard tn Cuba,

10,° Ray spoke of the desircability of stimulating the organisation
of "Pro-True Cuban Revolutioaary” stuient :roups in many countrt
of Latin America (he said a successful organisation hag beon formed
in Puerto Rico) and.of sending qualified representatives to those Latia
American countries where there is Soviet diplomatic representation to
contact student-and labor grouss and leaders in an effort to present to
them the true picture of the sorry state of students, workers, and
intellectuale in Castro's Cuba.

11. Rey ia aloo Interested in the possibility of putting out a "Nows
Letter" under MRP sponsorshiz which would.discucs various aspects of
the Cuban.picture and set forth plans for Cuba after the fall of Castro.
He thought euch a newe letter could yo a Jong way towards correcting
mistaken impressions amoay .\nerican’unlversity professors and in”
other circlas as to the true nature of the Castro regime. He pointed
to the recent letter from 6.1 Harvard profeassora which was recently
published in the N. Y, Times asa “horrible axample as to haw mia+
informed even university professare are on present day Cura.

12, When the discuasions yot around to the need Jor conducting
operations at least “under the umbrella” of the Revolationary Council,
and the need for obtaining Dr, Miro's concurrence before the U. S, ~
would.be able to support aay cperation, it was obvious that neither
Ins. Ray nor Mr, Betancourt holds a Aizh improgsion of the Council.
Both fee] that there is a strong possibility that the close public
identification of the Council wita the recect invasion may well have
discredited the Counci! to such aa extent that it commands no support
oF respect within Cuba.

For the sake of argumant the; were “illing to concede that the
poiltical advantages of maistainiay tne Council for the purpoee of forcing



unity of the various exile groupe may well outweigh ite other obvious
shortcomin;e. However, both feel, and Mr, Betancourt was quite
emphatic on thi point, that the Council ae a body {2 not capable of
directing clandestine actions against Castro and a9 a matter of fact
is opposed to any (urther, efforts at overthrowing Castro by sabotage
and other subversive actions since they are completely “sold” on
tha thesis that Castio can only be removed by direct U. S, military
action and therefore a continuation of Cuban underyground activiti
un onty result ia needless and-futile loes of life, In the fact of this
attitude, Ray said he does not expect ito receive much encouragement
for his plan from the Council, although he is fairly confident that
Dr. .Miro‘s approval can eventually be cbtained,

Ma, Betancourt thought that a workable solution might be found
to thelr problern if the Council would ayree to concern itself exclusively :
with (a) the current task of unifying the opposition, and (b) planning for H
ite future assumption of power as the provisional goverament, Under :

this arrangement, operations aimed at the duwnfall of Castro could be

entrusted to those leaders and groupe (such as the MRP, MRR, and
poseibly the 6 DC)-which have both the asseta and the will to do the

Job, Bir, Ray thought that it might be feasible to create an operations i
planning board or cormmand amon, the groups with demonstrated saseto :
and thu3 avoid unnecessary duplication and confusion and make possible

overall planning. It was obvious, however, that he would prefer to act

autonomously in the execution of his program,

easion

Mr, Ray was vory critical of Artime and claimed he was in po
of sufficient facts" to convince him that Artims, ia collusion with ele-
menta of the camps, were planniag to aliminate the MRP and j oe leaders
from the picture, when the invasion succeded, Us eaid hs "knows"
that Artime was being {inancially supported by wealthy ex~ apenas
of tba, Miami area,

13, Ray hinted at various times that tha MRP mimy at some point
find itssif (aced with the necessity of withdrawing from the Council and
going {t alone, He says that the Council ts composed of "ood men" but
they have no aaseta or significant (olowinys and “have nothing to offer
the people’of Cuba and aithough the proclamation of the Council, as
finally drafted, was a good one the “progressive” aspects of the proclam=
ation ware forced on the Council by the Americana and do not represent
the true feelings of the majority of the Council membsrs. He aid the



@ not likely to want to Fiek their lives on the basis of
r fant membership of the Council. He
that acceptance of the Couaci! would’be improved by adding to ito -
inemiberahip.two or three more people whose namos would be signl>
Heant-aad meéningful to the Cuban people. He did not name any
specific candidates,

‘Meri Ray lot me read a 13 oF 14 page report which he had
ived (rom the: MRP.coordinator in:Cuba (Reino! Gonzales)
‘which painted:a-dreary picture of conditions. 4a Cuba since the failure
of the invasiva; was critical of the-inciusion of Batistlanos and “ninos
bonitos" in'the invasion force; conveyed the strong fealing that the

; Cubans had been betrayed by the Americans; and indicated that while

‘the MRP ofganisation was etiil pretty much intact physically, morale
wae almost completely shattered. cr, Kay"said he would provide me.
a sanitized copy (there were some operational and personal details)
of the report for our information,

15,. In view of this report {rom within Cuba, Mr. Ray said that
he will with to defer submitting his plan for our consideration until
be Is able to recalve word from Cuba concerning the capabllitivs,
willingness aud foastbility of carrying out some of the activities he
basin roliid, He said it te useless to submit a program of action if
the human elements to carry .it out are lacking or completely demoral-
ined, He thought he ailght be able to present hfs prospectis within
approximately ten days. ‘He said naturally he will not give the poopie
inside any indication that he has been discussing a plan of action with

as.

16. Lurged Kay-to consider submitting at Ieast a preliminary and
admittedly tentative proppectus at thin time based on the asoumption
that bis assets aro. étill intact and will be willing to coopyrate in order
that it may receive early consideration, However, he stuck to bis
belief that thie would not be-practicable and reiterated the need for
prior evaluation of the strength and morale of his’ following.

17, Ray asked concerning the detainees at McAllen, Texas, and
wondered if they have been released, He was told that as far a3 1
know they are still under detection. He said itr, Goodwin had taken
their names and promised to look into the’matter, Mr, Betancourt
