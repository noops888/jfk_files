BIOGRAPHIC DATA Rolando CUBELA Secades was one of the activist
student leaders who assisted in the overthrow
a : of Batista and later turned against the Castro

regime because of disaffection with communism.
As early as March 1952, CUBELA was working
against Batista. With student friends, including
the four Humboldt Street martyrs made famous
in the Marcos Rodriguez trial,.CUBELA re-instituted
the University Student Federation or Directorate -
FEU or DR, as it is called. In 1956, CUBELA
participated in the assassination of Lt. Col.
Antonio. BLANCO Rico of. Batista's Military
Intelligence (SIM). Fleeing to the USA, he
became involved in military planning and purchasing
arms until 1 February 1958, when he and 16 other >
students returned clandestinely and into the
Escambray to fight. He led a famous column,
7 became the overall DR military leader. Although
the DR joined military forces with Castro's
26 July Movement, they refused Ernesto: "Che"
Guevarra's military leadership, fighting only
under CUBELA'S orders. They occupied the
Presidential Palace when Batista: fled on
1 January 1959 and initially declined to.turn
it over to Guevara and Castro. In October 1959,
i CUBELA became. president of the government—

“OPERATIONAL SUMMARY: 2. In Augiist 1962 CUBELA went to the Helsinki
: World Youth Festival wh
Tepedino who, introduced
under the alias William jOMmpSon .
This was a follow up to the first meeting
with the objective of inducing and
facilitating CUBELA'S defection. However ,
due to CUBELA'S plans, the objective became
an attempt to set up an internal dissident
‘ group for the overthrow. of the Government
ennai and sabotage. CUBELA said he.was not in- e
terested in any small undertaking, and declared
the assassination of Fidel and other leaders
would be the most effective way to rescue
the revolution from the Communists.

3. Later in August 1962 CUBELA “went on vacation"
in Paris where he met “Bill Thompson" again
and KUBARK sought more information on his
proposal to overthrow Castro.  CUBELA also
discussed the need for the U.S. to become
more deeply involved with LA students who,
ten years later, would be on the road to
becoming key figures in LA governments.
Tepedino was present at most of these meetings.

4. In late August-early September 1962, CUBELA
was taken to a U.S. Air Force Base in
southern France where he was given'a

- : demonstration in explosives. CUBELA had
. thought of blowing up an oil refinery and
was also considering the elimination of
Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the Soviet Ambassador,
and Fidel himself. CUBELA was not. given any

sabotage equi! t but was trained in SW.

at these meetings. CUBELA claimed he had
written two SW messages with FI (one was
received) but. nothing significant had been

to use SW because he feared the efficiency

of the cue censorship.

problem was, he explained, that although
many of them were anti-Communist, they were
loyal to Fidel. or they were so afraid, they
were reluctant to discuss any conspiracies
for fear they might be provocations. | CUBELA

» ’ OPERATIONAL SUMMARY: 7. The highlights of CUBELA'S reaction to this

proposal were: : 7
a. The majority of the Cuban people are Sti
. against Castro, but mainly because of fear they
did nothing about it. Castro's primary support
comes from the young teenage militia group.

b. Many high ranking military officers are
anti-Communist and many are convinced Castro must
go but they are afraid to organize or even talk
against Castro to other people. This fear and
Castro's control of the Government apparatus
(security, military, defense committee, economy,
etc.) make it extremely difficult to organize a
coup against him. :

ce. If Castro falls, the military will
probably break up into four or five groups.
Without Castro, the present regime will dis-
integrate. Unless there is strong and immediate
support, the situation can easily become chaotic.
Nothing of an operational nature was discussed
at this meeting. After the meeting, CUBELA
stated he was satisfied with the policy discussion
but he now desired to know what technical support
we could provide him.

8. On 19 November 1963 it was decided at
Headquarters that we would advise CUBELA
would receive a cache inside Cuba. If he
Hee requested it, the cache would include Sabotage
7 material, C-4 and equipment, high. power rifles
with scopes, hand grenades, pistols, etc.

9. On 22 November 1963, "Sanson" met CUBELA who
asked for 20 hand grenades, two high powered
rifles with scopes and approximately 20
pounds of C-4 and related. equipment in the
cache. He had refused to carry any in-
