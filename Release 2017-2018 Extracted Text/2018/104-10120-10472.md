MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Director for Support -

: The Militants: An Up-date on the
Black Power Threat : :

SUBJECT

1. This memorandum is for information only.

2. By memorandum entitled "Threat to CIA by Some
Black Power Elements," dated 1] December 1967, I advised you of
the results of inquiries with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the review of existing materials in the Office of Security concerning
militant "Black Power" organizations and personalities, I specifi-
cally noted those groups and personalities which have expressed
hostility against this Agency and its operations,

3. Since that time additional significant information has
been received which reflects increased activity on the part of the
‘militants, coupled with threats for what they have termed "The Bloody
Summer." Although the ranks of the extremists are still proportion-
ately small, their threats of violence must be given greater weight
than might normally be attributed to their small percentage of the U.S.
Negro population. A review of these recent developments is attached
for your information.

4, In addition to the new information on the extreme mili-
tants, we have also noted two scheduled developments for the months
of April and May which will be of interest to you, They are:

a. Beginning on 22 April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
‘WilTInHate their "Poor People's Campaign" in Washington, D.C.
On that day, Dr. King has indicated-he will lead "waves of the nation's”
poor and disinherited" into the city for prolonged,. disruptive and "non-
violent" demonstrations to demand government action for "jobs or in-
come for all,'' He has indicated that his initial cadre of up to 3, 000

SeCh

a


volunteers will remain in the nation's capital "until America responds,"
In what Dr. King calls the "last resort for nonviolence," SCLC re-
portedly plans lobbying and other action against the Capitol, a shut-down
of all government buildings, transportation tie-ups and school boycotts.
It has been threatened that if troops are used to quell these actions, Dr.
King will call for demonstrations in other key cities of the nation, As
the campaign escalates, SCLC has indicated it will call in peace groups
to strengthen the program.

Significantly, Dr. King's campaign will begin early
in the announced "International Days of Protest, " 21-30 April 1968,
sponsored by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in
Vietnam, a group in which Dr. King, Mrs. King, and Rev. James Bevel,
a King aide, have been particularly active. The National Mobilization
Committee is known to include members of the.Communist Party, USA,
and other subversive groups. Present plans for the ten-day Vietnam
protest call for local and regional demonstrations and concentrated
organizing efforts around the country, as well as coordinated protests
abroad. As part of the campaign, the Student Mobilization Committee to:-

End the War in Vietnam, Students for a Democratic Society, and SNCC's ~ ‘2 :

Black Anti-war Anti-Draft Union have issued a call for a national
student 'strike for peace in Vietnam and against racism at home and
abroad,'' 26 April. On 27 April the sponsors have called for a unified
demonstration of the full force of the movement with organized protests
and marches in major U.S. cities.

Spearheading the Washington campaign is Rev.
Bernard Lafayette, Jr., 27, a member of the civil rights movement
since he was a teen-ager. He was an original member of the Nashville,
Tennessee, student movement in 1960 and participated in the much-
publicized "Freedom Rides," As field secretary for the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee, he led voter registration and commu-
nity organizing campaigns in Mississippi and Alabama. His most recent
work has been with the American Friends Service Committee in Chicago
and as director of the Neighborhood Service Project in the enol
section of Boston.

Joining Lafayette i in . coordinating the Washington
protests is the Rev. James Bevel, who reportedly will direct the.!'non-

violence" during the campaign. Bevel, it will be recalled, was released ©

from his duties with the SCLC more than a year ago to become National

“Steet aie ee

AR

’

Director of the aforementioned National Mobilization to End the War
in Vietnam, the united front organization which includes a broad
grouping of organizations of diverse political philosophies, including
Communist, Socialist, pacifist and civil rights. It was this organiza-

‘tion which sponsored the 15 April 1967 demonstrations in New York

City and San Francisco and the Pentagon protests of 21 October 1967.
Politically, Bevel has leaned far to the Left. He has vigorously pro-
tested U.S. policy in Vietnam and has called the President a murderer.
Although not specifically declaring himself to be a member of the
Communist Party, he stated on 5 March 1966, in reply to a question
about Communist Party membership, that "every thinking American
should be." He has also stated: "We here will decide what the Govern-
ment will be when we take over." His wife, also active in the Vietnam
protest movement, was one of the "peace ladies" who met with North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong representatives in Southeast Asia in 1966,

Despite Dr. King's statements the Washington
protests are for "jobs or income for all," there can be little doubt
the activity will be closely interlinked with the 'peace' movement,
particularly at the stage when "peace" groups are formally invited in
as the activity escalates. The FBI has noted that Dr. King has shown
not only a willingness, but even an eagerness to accept Communist aid,
to support Communist causes, to confer with high-ranking Communist
functionaries, and to rely heavily upon the advice and direction of
dedicated Communists with concealed affiliation. It notes, specifically,
that one of these Communist advisors wrote King's vicious denunciation
of U.S. policy in Vietnam which he delivered before the 15 April 1967
rally held in New York City by Bevel's National Mobilization Committee
to End the War in Vietnam (then called the Spring Mobilization Com-
mittee). According to the FBI, Dr. King is regarded in Communist
circles as ''a genuine Marxist-Leninist who is following the Marxist-
Leninist line." :

b. Close on the heels of the initiation of Rr, King's
Washington campaign, and possibly well-timed with the proposed formal
call for participation by "peace" groups as that campaign escalates, are
the "National Days for Black Unity Against the War in Vietnam, 19-20
May 1968." Sponsored by the Peking-line Progressive Labor Party
and certain to attract the more militant factions, the protest calls for
nationwide demonstrations "against the war in Vietnam and slum Jand-

lords," The announcéd highpoint of the protests is a day of widespread _

work stoppage and demonstrations on campuses and in cities through-
out the United States, tentatively set for 19 May. A potential for

- disturbance exists since the Maoist sponsors will have had almost a
month to observe and assess the effects of Dr. King's Washington
campaign,

5. Iwill continue’ to keep you advised on significant dévelop-
ments in this area as they come to our attention, You will be pleased
to know FBI liaison has been most cooperative and effective in providing
this office with timely information about the various domestic militants
and protest groups.

21 July 1965

In connection with another matter, a source of.-this office talked
to Mr. Jay Richard KENNEDY’ at his residence, New York City, on 13-July
1965. (Various topics were covered during the interview and have been
reported under separate memoranda.) Following are(Mr. KENNEDY's couments
(not verbatim) concerning James FARMER of CORE which(Mr. KENNEDY indicated
should be forwarded in part to the President. In this connection, it should
be noted that the source made it specifically clear to ‘Mr. KENNEDY that he
had no access to the White House, or any channel to the White House, but
that he would report ‘Mr. KENNEDY's' comments in his usual channel into his
own particular office within the Agency.

Mr. KENNEDY: pointed out that James FARMER, -who-is head of CORE, is
_the number one target of the Maoist Communists and that by target(Mr. |
\KENNEDY specifically meant that FARMER either had to be assassinated or _
"engulfed" and taken over by the Peking-line Communists. (Mr. KENNEDY: statea
that this was obvious since FARMER is the only known non-violence advocate
who is an outstanding anti-Commnist and the foremost negro leader who
commands a national following. (Mr. KENNEDY stated Martin Luther KING has
already shown his hand by attacking the Administration and advocating a
pull-out in Vietnam (KENNEDY insists that KING is compromised by his moral
background and is probably controlled by Peking-line Communists); A. Phillip
RANDOLPH is out of the United States and is very inactive; Harry BELAFONTE,
of course, is a Communist and undoubtedly Peking controlled; and Whitney
YOUNG and Roy WILKINS have no popular grass-roots type of following.

(Mr. KENNEDY stated that the effort to "get" FARMER was obvious in
the recent CORE convention at Durham, North Carolina, where efforts were
made to remove FARMER as head of CORE and where the convention had adopted
an anti-Administration "pull-out of Vietnam” line. (Mr. KENNEDY stated ob-
viously this was Peking~line inspired and. the remarkable about-face that
FARMER forced on the convention not only showed FARMER's control and.
courage, but very clearly targeted him to the Peking-line Commmists. ‘Mr.’
(KENNEDY pointed out it must be remembered that while the convention was
going on, Martin Luther KING issued a public statement denouncing U. S.
policy and advocating pulling out of Vietnam.

Further, ‘Mr. KENNEDY. commented that FARMER's wife, Lulu, who is a
white woman, had called(Mr. KENNEDY from Durham and that ‘Mr. KENNEDY had, =
in addition to offering advice » offered to come to Durham at that time. iMr.:
\KENNEDY ‘commented he cannot state the exact effect his talk with Mrs.

FARMER had (which is apparently unknown to James FARMER), but it was ob-
vious that. FARMER's reversing the CORE convention stand followed in the wake
of this telephone call. Further, according to.Mr. KENNEDY, FARMER, immedi-
ately upon arriving in New York from Durham, called Mr. KENNEDY.

Subsequently, according to(Mr. KENNEDY, he has talked with FARMER
both before his trip to Bogalusa, Louisiana, and after his return. Mr.”
(KENNEDY ‘stated that he had asked FARMER about the situation in Louisiana
and FARMER had explained his views in the following manner which is the basis
for the KENNEDY recommendation of passing the information to the White House.
FARMER stated that his problem in Bogalusa and also in other places in the
South is the fact that the poor negro families, most of whom reside in
isolated areas of country surrounding the towns, are subject to terror and
intimidation by bands of white extremists who threaten and actually commit
bodily harm on these negro people. Furthermore, these people have no means
of transportation and to try to get them to come into town to register as
voters, facing the difficulties of intimidation and lack of transportation,
is a major problem. According to FARMER, there has been no help for these
people until the advent of the so-called Deacons and that the Deacons have
offered assistance and more importantly physical protection. FARMER stated
that when these people turned to him and asked "What can we do?", FARMER
had no real answer. According to(Mr. KENNEDY, he asked FARMER why didn 't-
he appeal to the President personally since FARMER does have access to the
White House, and FARMER stated that he could not do this now. (Mr. KENNEDY
asked him why he could not and FARMER explained that if he publicly appealed
to the President after forcing the CORE convention to reverse its stand on
Vietnam, it would look like a "deal" and that he, FARMER, could be dis-
credited because of this. ‘Mr. KENNEDY asked FARMER what type of appeal
should be made to the White House and FARMER, in substance, replied that
if the White House were to send in either federal troops or federal marshals
to protect the negro voters then he, FARMER, could handle thé Deacons. Mr.”
(KENNEDY asked FARMER if he knew the leadership of the Deacons and named
Ernest THOMAS and "Val" SIMS. FARMER stated, of course, he knew both of
these individuals and when asked -by(Mr. KENNEDY about how many Deacons there
were, FARMER stated that all told they had estimated about 10,000. (Mr. ?
(KENNEDY then said how could you handle the Deacons assuming that you had
federal troops or marshals to help. According to Mr. KENNEDY, FARMER stated
that he would tell the Deacons and their leaders to "cool it" and "they
would cool it." (Mr. KENNEDY insisted that FARMER is extremely positive on
this point. aed

According to‘Mr. KENNEDY, FARMER is somewhat naive politically and
although (Mr. KENNEDY*has tried to explain to him the Maoist tactics, FARMER
does not as yet fully comprehend them. (Mr. KENNEDY stated it is perfectly
obvious that behind the Deacons is a strong organization force of hard
core Peking-line Communists. (Mr. KENNEDY further stated that the Communists
are provoking violence and also quite obviously they are provoking violence
in an area where CORE is active. Also it was clearly apparent that they
worked against FARMER at the national CORE convention at Durham, North

(Mr. KENNEDY stated that there is a facade of legitimate, harassed
negroes who are honestly trying to protect other negroes (and themselves)
by defending them by physical means and that these negroes are being duped
and pushed into violence by the Communists. They, of course, do not. under-
stand this. “Mr. KENNEDY further said that FARMER, himself, does not
directly understand although he may have learned a rude lesson at the
Durham, North Carolina, convention where he was nearly kicked out of his
leadership. In addition, ‘Mr. KENNEDY stated that if the negroes got federal
support and FARMER stopped the Deacons movement, this would leave the hard
core Communists behind the Deacons exposed and vulnerable.

(Mr. KENNEDY stated that it is his intention to meet with FARMER as

soon as possible and go over again with him the matter of the Deacons and
the left-wing political maneuvers behind the Deacons. os

Memorandum

TO : Chief, Security Research Staff DATE: 7 July 1965
FROM: Chief, Liaison & External Ops Branch/SRS
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversations withJay Richard KENNEDY,

5 July and 6 July 1965

1. Set out following is a very brief summary of Mr. KEN-
‘NEDY's views and comments of recent events, particularly in the civil
rights area.

2. Mr. KENNEDY, in the first conversation which was on
5 July, stated that his study of the activities of the various leaders in
the civil rights movement and the positions taken by the various groups
have forced him to the conclusion that there is an almost complete split
in the civil rights movement and that those groups which are militant
and advocating violent action have been captured by the Peking-line Com-
munists. He stated that there is a great deal of information which waild
support this contention. Along this line, it is particularly interesting to
note that the Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, commented that Hanoi had
spurned the peace éfforts of the Unitéd States which, according to KEN-
(NEDY, shows how contemptuous the Peking-line is of us and, of course,
is reflected in the anti-United States policy attacks of the action groups. in
the civil rights movement. KENNEDY pointed out that Martin Luther
KING was now linking the civil rights movement to attacks on our policy
in Vietnam and that others were following this trend.

3. Mr. KENNEDY. stated that a few days back James FARMER,
head of CORE, had denounced men appearing in CORE picket lines who
were armed; but\KENNEDY stated that FARMER had not followed up this
protest and had not moved strongly after he had made this attack.

4, He stated that all of the Negro groups have a wing that
want§ militant action and that these groups are subject to or soon will be

subject to Peking direction and domination.

5, ‘Mr. KENNEDY concluded this long conversation by stating
that at the present moment, it is a certain conclusion that the Peking-line

Communists have achieved a "fifth column" in the United States and that
this will be used not only to disrupt and attempt to capture the civil rights
movement, but will be used as a weapon to attack U.S. policy in South
Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and wherever the Peking-line Commu-
nists direct.

6. On 6 July'‘Mr. KENNEDY called and pointed out that FARM-
ER had apparently suddenly moved in a bid to become the top negro leader
in the United States who champions non-violence and anti- Communism.
(KENNEDY stated, that with Martin Luther KING moving toward the Peking-
line and splitting the civil rights movement between militants and activists
and the non-violent groups, FARMER's stand at the CORE convention in
Durham, North Carolina, over the past few days was remarkable. KEN-
\NEDY referred to the New York Times article, page 1, which very clearly
shows that FARMER had reversed a CORE stand against our government's
activities in Vietnam and had successfully led a fight to take CORE out of
international politics and to concentrate that group in the civil rights area.
Further, according to\KENNEDY, it should be noted that FARMER went
solidly against such so-called self-defense organizations as the "Deacons".

7. When asked to explain what finally produced this strong
change on FARMER's part,( Mr. KENNEDY stated that there were probably
a number of factors, but certainly one of the factors had to be the fact that
Mr. FARMER is married to a woman of the white race. ‘Mr. KENNEDY)
also stated that possibly FARMER was beginning to realize the splitting in
the movement and had decided the time had come to take a firm position.
‘KENNEDY pointed out that he had been urging FARMER to do this for some
time.

8. KENNEDY stated that he had made several telephone calls
to FARMER's wife and that she had filled him in on the fight in the CORE
convention in Durham, North Carolina, which the New York Times article
covered, ‘KENNEDY stated that it was remarkable that FARMER could
reverse an already determined position by the convention and that he could
take command of the group as he had done, \KENNEDY added that this
would probably bring Allan MORRISON in line behind FARMER and would
give FARMER the benefit of the publicity of the magazines that MORRISON
directs.

9. KENNEDY? concluded by saying that this hard stand by

this position,

last night. :Jay said that Sidney POITIER and Livingston WINGATE at
the prompting of BELLAFONTE went into a lengthy discussion of how
Martin Luther KING obtained his money some years ago. According to
‘KENNEDY,’ B FONTE is setting the stage for a future discussion of
this matter ‘when KING appears tonight on the show.

2. ‘KENNEDY:concludes that the reason for the discussion of the
alleged source of the funds supplied to KING at this late date must be
because there has been a leak of information and all concerned realize
that probably the FBI is putting pressure on KING to disclose the true
source of the funds.

SUBJECT : REPORT FROM(Jay Richard KENNEDY :

1. (Jay reported that following the assassination of the
Reverend Martin Luther KING, Jim FARMER called Jay for advice.
FARMER claimed. that President JOHNSON by telephoning Whitney YOUNG
and other Negroes of the same persuasian extending the President's
sympathy on the untimely death of the Reverend KING manifests the
belief that the President is misinformed in matters of this delicacy.
FARMER claims that the Negroes are embittered and believe that if the
President had not been spending all of oir resources on- winning the
war in Viet Nam, this tragic event would not have occured. ot

2. According to, KENNEDY, FARMER stated that he, FARMER, had
been in touch with the Reverend FOUNTROY and FOUNTROY stated that the
poor peoples march on Washington which KING was to lead on 22 April
1968 will still be held.

3. (KENNEDY said that he had called Bill CONNELL and recommended
that the President issue a proclamation which would make this weekend
one of silent prayer. He suggested that the President call upon all
ministers, rabbi¢s and priests to concentrate on texts which would
emphas{@ the need for peace in the world. (KENNEDY said that he also
suggested to Bill Connell that the President extend an invitation to
Mahalia JACKSON to sing Sunday in a memorial service in Washington, D. Cc.
at the Lincoln Memorial. (KENNEDY said that he would be able to bring
SINATRA to Washington at the same time to sing hymns known and loved
‘by the black race. (KENNEDY: said that today at sundown begins the Jewish
Sabbath and that he had urged Bill CONNELL to request that his suggestions
be acted upon forthwith. (KENNEDY said that he hates to see this govern-
ment reacting to notification that the New York Stock Exchange will shit
down its trading at 11:00 today and use the time for silent prayer.
KENNEDY said that he also noted that campuses all over the United States
have also agreed to hold memorial services. that this govern-
ment should be way out front in this regard and

2. ‘KENNEDY advised that Harry BELAFONTE was not in evidence

on TV following the assassination of Martin Luther KING on Thursday,
4 April 1968. (KENNEDY received word from a reliable source that
BELAFONTE, who is under Peking discipline, was instructed notito be

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: (Jay KENNEDY, Conversation with

1. The writer had a short discussion this morning with' Jay
(Kennedy concerning the involvement of A. Philip RANDOLPH, the distinguished
Negro leader, in the so-called "Declaration of Conscience" against partici-
pation in the war in Vietnam. In fact, this Declaration of Conscience goes
so far as to attempt to get Negroes to refuse to register for the draft
which is, infact, illegal activity and against Federal law. ner

2. In summarizing (Kennedy's point of view, the problem appears
to be something like this. The Communist left is making an all out drive
to get into the Negro movement. If through any mechanism they can link
prominent Negro leaders to illegal activities and activity which is against
President Johnson's policy, this may cause a serious break between Johnson
and the Negro leadership which, in turn, may create a violent disruption
in the Negro Civil Rights Movement which would give the Communists an
opportunity to cause chaos and disruption.

3. Furthermore, if the above is coupled with an exposure of
Martin Luther KING, Jr. by other then members of his own race, the damage
to the Negro movement would be impossible to estimate. \Kennedy is gravely
concerned that KING may be exposed by white sources, official or otherwise,
which would have no good effect and would probably only make KING a martyr j
; possibly be assassinated before,
his exposure which would have the effect of making. him a martyr and would not
be at all helpful to the Negro movement. It is'Kennedy's belief that. some- Y «
ow or other Martin Luther KING must be removed from the leadership of the | p fl

Negro movement, and his removal must come from within not from without. my ke

be a Negro leader who is "clean" who could step into the vacuum and chaos
if Martin Luther KING were either exposed or assassinated.

‘Kennedy feels that somewhere in the Negro movement, at the top, there must \"

4. In summary, Kennedy feels that unless the Negro leaders,
other than KING, are informed and are capable of intelligent maneuvering,
the Comiunists or Negro elements who will be directed by the Communists
may be in a position’ to, if not take over the Negro movement, completely
disrupt it and hence cause extremely critical problems for the Government
of the United States.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Research Staff

SUBJECT : (KENNEDY, Jay Richard
(Conversation with 8 June 1965,
Washington, D.C.)

1. On 8 June 1965, the writer met with Mr. Kennedy at the Hilton
‘Hotel, Washington, and had a long discussion with him beginning at approxi-
mately 1:15 and ending at 5 p.m. Mr. Kennedy's, comments covered a wide
range of matters, but basically they.can be broken down into 3 main topics; :
ud

(a) His attitude towards the FBI; la

(b)| His thoughts concerning the writing of a series of books ¥
with the protagonist a CIA agent; and enmnensmen ee

(c) Comments on the Negro Civil Rights Movement, the various
personalities connected with it, and some of (Mr. Kennedy's
opinions and theories regarding future events connected
with the Civil Rights Movement.

Each of the above will be discussed separately.

Mr. Kennedy's attitude towards the FBI

2. Sometime back, Chief, SRS, decided that it would be advantageous
to have Mr. Kennedy give information, particularly regarding the Civil Rights
Movement, to agents of the FBI in New York City, particularly if this infor-
mation concerned domestic or local events and activities. Chief, SRS, felt
that it would be a faster means of communication than heretofore used where-
in ‘Mr. Kennedy communicated with SRS officers who, in turn, passed the in-
formation to either the FBI or areas where it was useful.

3. ‘Mr. Kennedy: made it very clear that he did not wish to conmmuni-
cate with FBI agents, that the Civil Rights Movement should be regarded as
an international situation because of the Commnist directed infiltration
into the movement, and that he felt in some respects that he was being
"aowngraded" by being a a a wrk ce by the FBI and not in a higher echelon

of Government. While ‘Mr. Kennedy did not absolutely refuse to cooperate
with.the Bureau, he made it obvious that only if there was a matter which
he felt was of interest directly to the Bureau locally, would he furnish
this type of information; otherwise, he would furnish it as he has done
previously or cease altogether. The writer attempted, more or less unsuc-
cessfully, to discuss jurisdiction with Mr. Kennedy, but'Mr. Kennedy main-
tained his position that the matter was not one of jurisdiction for the FBI

or any single Government agency, but was one that the Government, including \
CIA, should be interested in; namely, the international Commmist efforts xe
at corrupting and seizing the Negro Civil Rights Movement. a
o
J
Aamo

Mr. Kennedy's thoughts regarding a possible writing of a series of noyels \
aimed at improving the picture of CIA and defending this Government's actions !
and the activities of the CIA in support of the Government. oat

4. During the long conversation, (Mr. Kennedy introduced this sub-
ject by saying that he was sick and tired of the poor public picture that
was constantly being presented of the CIA by all sorts of writers, left-
wing and otherwise. He stated that Government agents were generally painted
; 8S fools and idiots, and that the Headquarters activities obviously were
; some sort of super government who acted solely on their own and aten against
| the interests of the United States. He stated that he had read a number of
; books such as "The Invisible Gove: nt", and this type of reporting dis-
; gusted him. He stated that he had mind the writing of a series of novels, :
H using a CIA agent as hero, which would reflect decent, intelligent, and :
i

courageous work on behalf of the United States. He stated that the James
Bond books by Fleming averaged 190-200 pages, and he felt that he could
write this type of a novel once or twice a year in addition to his serious
work.as a novelist.

i ‘NOTE: Mr. Kennedy's latest novel is. about to be-published, and he was in i
‘Washington for the American Booksellers Association Convention. . i
5. \Mr. Kennedy’ stated he was certain that he could handle this type

i of writing since he had demonstrated his capacity as a writer, but that he §
might require certdin technical assistance, particularly in terms of trade-!
craft and certain fundamental matters of which he had little knowledge. He’
indicated that perhaps some support could be given him if it was agreed that
the idea of the novels had merit, and that support could take the shape of ;
area knowledge, tradecraft, terminology, and perhaps some operational t
matters which were not sensitive or classified.

6. The writer indicated that the idea had merit and that possibly
he could be given-some technical support on-a covert basis. The writer
wanted to know who would publish this, or did Mr. Kennedy have in mind any
particular publisher who would publish this if Mr. Kennedy wrote it. ‘Mr.

‘Kennedy stated that he was absolutely certain that his own publisher would

jump at the chance to publish this type of novel if he thought Mr. Kenmdy
would write them, and‘Mr. Kennedy was quite willing to discuss the matter

with his publisher, quite possibly during the following evening. Mr. Kennedy
stated that he had given this matter considerable thought and because he

was incensed at the bad press the Agency and other Government institutions |
were getting, he would be quite willing to undertake this task. He added

that he already had conceived three plots that he felt would be suitable in |
this connection. i |

7. The writer, as ntioned above, encouraged‘Mr. Kennedy’ but stated
he could make no substantial commitment, but that he would like to discuss 7
these proposals with Chief, SRS and other associates.

8. On 9 June 1965, \Mr. Kennedy, who was then leaving Washington,
called the writer and stated that he had talked this idea over with his
publishers and they are enthusiastic about the idea since he said he would
be willing to undertake it, and that, in turn, they would bring to bear all
of their capacity for distribution of literary works. ‘Mr. Kennedy stated
that his publisher is with the,Yorld Publishers, Inc., who are, in turn,
controlled by the Chandler interests of the Wes coast. The writer again
thanked ‘Mr. Kennedy and stated that the matter would immediately be discussed. ;
NOTE: It should be noted that Mr. Kennedy is a thoroughly experienced ‘|
writer with a number of books to his credit and is not given to idle con-
Ret tebiiae in matters such head this (see attached).

Civil Rights Movement

9. For background information, it is to be recalled that Mr.

(Kennedy has long provided information on the Negro Civil Rights Movement

and its various leaders. “Mr. Kennedy's position is one of complete sympathy
with the Negro and the Civil Rights Movement, but holds that only through
legal means and peaceful means should the Negro aims be accomplished. Mr.

(Kennedy, who is a violent anti-Communist, has been alarmed at the Communist

movement into the Negro Civil Rights field and the Communist penetration into
the various Negro organizations. He has undeniably done everything in his
capacity to help thé Negro eee particularly James FARMER of CORE.

Eves GL

It is worth noting for the record that\Mr. Kennedy has been involved with
various Negro leaders since as early as 1934; -and he.has known a number of
the leaders, on a very close personal basis, since that time. a

10. “Mr. Kennedy's main concern has been that the highly derogatory
information, of which he is familiar, concerning Martin Luther KING, Jr.,
will be exposed to the public by the wrong people and at the wrong time
which, in‘Mr. Kennedy's opinion, will set the Civil Rights Movement back
years and would perhaps give the Communists a chance to either farther dis-
rupt it or toseize control of the movement.

il. To make certain that this report reflects as accurately as
possible the derogatory information on Martin Iuther KING, Jr., here are
three main categor® s:

(a) Highly derogatory information on sexual abno: ities and
sexual activities which have teken place within the United
States and overseas;

(b) A possible theft of money; and

(c) Association with identified Communist or pro-Soviet types
on an intense personal basis, particularly Harry BELAFONTE,
the Negro actor/singer. i

To further set the background, it should be recalled that several months
ago @ very serious dispute erupted between Mr. John Edgar HOOVER and Martin
Iuther KING, Jr. At that time James FARMER, head of CORE, received infor-
mation, from an absolutely reliable source, that the FBI had derogatory in-
formation on Martin Luther KING, Jr., that Mr. HOOVER was incensed on attacks
on his agents and the integrity of.his organization, and that. grave possi-
bilities existed that Mr. HOOVER would turn loose to the public the derog-
atory information which has been presented above. In turn, FARMER gaye the
information, in confidence, to\Mr. Kennedy and at approximately the same
time, FARMER confronted Martin Luther KING, Jr. with the facts. It is suf-
ficient to say that the matter was hushed up by KING visiting HOOVER. A

“number of meetings took place between the top Negro leaders and discussions

were held as to what to do about the derogatory information, since obviously
other individuals would know about it. To date, nothing has been done, and
the debate is going on in the top Negro channels at the present time.

ll. With this background in mind, the writer asked\Mr. Kennedy who
were the top Negro leaders that he was in contact with and what were their
relationships one to another. The writer named the following individuals,
and these were acknowledged by Mr. Kennedy as persons with whom he was
dealing:

Whitney YOUNG of the Urban League

Roy WILKINS of the NAACP

James FARMER of CORE

A. Phillip RANDOLPH, veteran Negro union leader -

Allan MORRISON, top Negro-editor and journalist in the ia
United States.

The other leaders of first magnitude that entered the discussion are Martin
luther KING, Jr. and Harry BELAFONTE, who has been established clearly as

a close and intimate friend of Martin Luther KING, Jr. and whose left wing
background is also known. Some of the lesser Negro leaders will be mentioned
later, but those of the greater strength and opposed to KING are YOUNG,
WILKINS, FARMER, RANDOLPH, and MORRISON. (Mr. Kennedy replied to the ques-
tion of rapport among these leaders by saying flatly that there was no rap-
port at all, that all mistrust and dislike the other, and in certain cases,
there was often antagonism. (Mr. Kennedy stated that the brightest, shrewdest >
and cleverest of all was Roy WILKINS, but a man who had no popular or grass
roots following. He stated that Whitney YOUNG was a bright Negro, but who
had no following whatsoever in the popular sense, but was making a definite
play to gain power by seeking to be publicly connected with important
individuals both in the Government and.out. ‘Mr. Kennedy described A. Phillip
RANDOLPH as a controversial old man, possibly becoming senile, who was afraid
to act for fear of damaging his ow reputation and who liked to imagine
himself as the "Moses" of the Negro race. RANDOLPH has some popular follow-
ing, but he is aloof and has not committed himself as intensely as some of
the others. James FARMER, according to Kennedy, is probably the most sin-
cere and devoted of the leaders,’ but is naive and has a complete capacity
for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. FARMER personally is clean

and he does, in fact, have the grass roots support of the large organization
CORE, which he controls.’ Mr.Kennedy insisted that he is law abiding, non-
violent, and a decent individual, but not too politically intelligent.

12. ‘Mr. Kennedy stated that for weeks the problem of Martin Luther
KING, dr.-has been discussed between these leaders and that all of them are
aware of the details. (Mr. Kennedy stated that to show the range of con-
nections involved here and the sensitive nature of it, he gave the following
example.

He said that a few days ago, he was in the office of Whitney
YOUNG to discuss with him this matter. ‘Mr. Kennedy stated that
for the first 15 minutes or so, YOUNG was constantly being called
to the telephone and the conversation was interrupted. . Mr.
.Kennedy commented that the first two calls that came in were in-
consequential, but he stated that the third call was from the
President of the United States. ‘Mr. Kennedy stated that he -
listened to two more calls then told-YOUNG that either he would
have to quit accepting phone calls or Mr. Kennedy would no longer | _
discuss anything with him. Whitney YOUNG then told his secretary
to stop the calls, and they discussed the matter. ‘Mr. Kennedy
stated that the conversation was basically his attempting to
get Whitney YOUNG to come to some agreement with the other leaders
on the KING matter by pointing out that Roy WILKINS was in favor
of “dumping” KING, and that he, Whitney YOUNG, hadn't committed
himself to anything. ‘Mr. Kennedy indicated that this conversation
was not profitable.

13. Of considerable importance to/Mr. Kennedy was the following.
He was having a conversation with Allan MORRISON, the Negro editor, and
MORRISON said to him that he had received confirmation, in exact detail, of
the derogatory KING story. Further, that the information had come from
Washington from a highly placed official in the Department of Justice, Mr.

who had in turn conveyed the information to a Mr. 7 a Negro
also attached. to the Department of Justice, who was working in Chicago and
who had given it directly to Allan MORRISON.. MORRISON stated that he was
told that the Washington source had the entire KING file in his office in-
cluding photographs and tapes on Martin Luther KING, Jr. ‘ Mr. Kennedy said
he asked MORRISON if he had done anything about this; and, according to
Mr. Kennedy, MORRISON told him that he called a meeting of the top editors
and officials of the Johnson publications (Ebony, etc.) of which he,
MORRISON, is the top editor. According to MORRISON, he told those present
the story. After some shocked silence, Mr. JOHNSON said +o MORRISON ana
those present, we cannot publish that; and Mr. Kennedy said that MORRISON
told Mr. JOHNSON, if we don't publish it, it is going to blow up underneath
our noses because it is certain to come out sooner or later.

14. (Mr. Kennedy stated that the details of the KING matter are
definitely known to the editors of the New York Times and the New York Es
Herald Tribune, but they will not break the story because they have been
asked not to. (Mr. Kennedy stated presumably by the President.

15. The writer than referred to the\ Kennedy thesis that Martin Luther
KING, Jr. is moving in a way that is indicative that he is being controlled
by the Peking line Commmists, possibly or probably through BELAFONTE, from
whom there is some information that would indicate he is a Maoist. The
writer asked\Mr. Kennedy what possible action would the Peking line Commu-
nists take in the KING matter. (Mr. Kennedy replied by saying that it is
certain to him that the Commmists, both the Moscow and the Peking types,
are aware of the Martin Luther KING, Jr. matter. Mr. Kennedy stated as far
as he could figure out, the Peking Commmists would handle KING in one of
two ways: ee

(a) We will permit you to remain head of the Negro movement in
the United States and you may continue to rise in public ac-
claim. The other Negro leaders have no courage and they
will not expose you. They are cowards and controlled by
the Capitalist leaders of the United States. You will, how-
ever, remember that we know what the story is and you will
do what you are told. Or

(b) They, themselves, the Peking Commmists, will expose KING
and in so doing they will end him, they will everlasting
discredit all the other Negro leaders, and they will then
be in a position to disrupt the Negro movement, cause chaos
and trouble, and possibly gain control of it. If they ex-
pose KING, they will say to the Press and public media which
they control to the Negro people, that yow leaders have be-
trayed you, they ‘knew this story of KING all along and were
cowardly. They obeyed instructions from their capitalist -
leaders.

16.°(Mr. Kennedy stated that he is absolutely convinced that the
Peking line Commnists are moving ahead of the Moscow Communists, both in
the world area and in the domestic scene. He pointed out that BELAFONTE has
taken over the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and that James
FORMAN, its National Executive Secretary, is going along with this. He
stated that there are other indications of the Peking line Commmists show-
ing strength, and that there are a number of ways this can be demonstrated.
He called attention to the fact that for the last 3 or 4 weeks there has been
@ period of inaction and that none of the Negro leaders, except James FARMER

of CORE, have been doing anything when they should have been strongly
active. (Mr..Kennedy'states that it is his opinion that this is due to the
movement being held in check by Peking line Communists who are demonstrating
and consolidating their strength. He stated further that the "deacons" are
nothing more than small ad hoc groups which the Peking line Communists have
set up as needed and are, in fact, riding on the back of CORE. (Mr. Kennedy
stated that they are not CORE groups, but are activist Negro advocates of
violence and who are working to disrupt and smear CORE and its leadership.
They are constantly working to convert CORE from a non-violent group into an
action group which would, of course, put CORE in the Peking line.

17. The writer askediMr. Kennedy if there was any indication that he
knew of that would show that the Negro leaders--YOUNG, WILKINS, FARMER,
RANDOLPH or MORRISON--were going to expose KING. ‘ Mr. Kennedy stated that
there is no such information, that none of them wanted to be responsible for
the exposure, nor could they agree among themselves to do it as a group. © ~
MORRISON, himself, according to Kennedy, would like to expose the situation,
but he could not do this alone and unsupported. | Mr. Kennedy stated again,
as he had many times previously, that unless this exposure comes from the
Negro leaders themselves, the attacks on KING will be useless and will end
up only making him perhaps a martyr and would set back the Negro Civil Rights
Movement for years. F

: 18. Toward the end of the conversation, (Mr. Kennedy pointed out that
any examination of the Civil Rights Movement, at the present time, would show
a clear and concise picture of Communist penetration and activities, namely,
from the Peking line Communists. (Mr. Kennedy said it is well to note that
the war in Vietnam has now been linked to the Civil Rights Movement and,
gradually, the two unrelated areas are being blended together in an all out
Communist Party line ‘attack on U.S. policy. Mr. Kennedy stated that this has
spread confusion into the Negro Civil Rights Movement and has duped many of
the leaders of the movement and caused them to make utterances which are
stupid and certainly unpatriotic. “Mr. Kennedy referred to the activities and
statements of A. Phillip RANDOLPH in behalf of the "Refusal to Fight" move-
ment.

19. Mr. Kennedy further said that the aims of the Communists were
clear in that they wanted to link the Negro leadership and the Negro mass
Civil Rights Movement into a position of anti-government action, and that
the Peking line would be away from the Moscow "peaceful coexistence line",
and would be continuous agitation for violent action and disruption. He
stated that so called leaders like Martin Luther KING, Jr. and Harry BELA-
FONTE have very clearly started blending the Negro Civil Rights Movement into

@ merger with their attacks on the government policy in Vietnam and, even to
a lesser degree, into attacks on government policy in the Dominican Republic.
‘Mr. Kennedy predicted that more and more of this will appear as the summer
goes along. He stated that among the most important leaders of the movement,
he felt that only Allan MORRISON had a thorough understanding of the problem,
that FARMER in a vague way understood the problem, but was not acute enough
to clearly understand it and combat it. He said WILKINS and Whitney YOUNG
probably understood this matter, but they are too busy attempting to create
a good image of themselves in the public eye to be willing to get down and
fight this penetration in an all out manner.

20. (Mr. Kennedy stated that he would be continuously in touch with
either Chief, SRS or the writer as he obtained information of interest.

MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Director for Support

SUBJECT : Threat to GIA by Some "Black Power"
Elements

1. This memorandum is for information only.

2, The growing hostility expressed toward this Ageacy by
some of the more volatiles advocates of so-called “black power” pre-
seats this Agency with what might be a new threat to ites operations
abroad and its image in the United States.

3. In the past, denunciation of the Agenty by a scattered
few for the alleged Ageacy “ggeassination" of Patrice Lamurada aad
wialeolm X. Little might have been dismissed as natural fall-out from »
embittered followers of the two, seeking a publicly-recognisabie
scapegoat, and necessarily distorting the true facts behind the death
to have them “prove” the case against the scapegoat. Presently, how
ever, the growing militancy of “black power” disciples --with clear i 7
links to both Maoist and Moscow Communist? ideologies--and similarly 3
clear threats to counter this Agency's activities, necessitates placing 3
the problem in an entirely new perspective. aod

#

4, The term “black power," despite ite militant origings. * |
has been accepted by some to describe the laudable efforts of economic |; f
“self-help and “pride of race" efforts of many Negroes at the commu-- t :
nity and collegiate level. Indeed, some of those of sincere dedication = { } {
te the orthodox civil rights movement have accepted the use of the term ar)
“black power" to describe their efforts. This presents the problemef ©. ¢
separating these constructive efforts--and advocates--from those whose /
goal is the destruction of the legally consiftuted government o: A

,



5. At least two organizations, the National Urban League and
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, have
questioned the motives and tactics of those who advocate ' black power”
and‘ black rebellion,’ and such respected Negro journalists as Carl
T. Rowan and George Schuyler have warned against the militants, In
its report for Fiscal Year 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
has pointed out that ‘So-called civil rights organizations preaching
hatred for the white race, demanding immunity from laws, and advo=
cating violence constitute a serious threat to our country's internal
security."" (Emphasis added) The FBI annual report specifically
names the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Revo-
lutionary Action Movement as hoping "to disrupt the tranquility of our
Nation with violence to further the concept of "black power," Accord-
ing to the FBI report, “Leaders of these groups constantly attempt to
spread domestic discord among Negroes by making inflammatory
speeches and issuing hate-filled literature." (The same report warns -
of mech militant organizations as the Movimento Pro Indepencia de
Puerto Rico, a group which has signed an “accord” to work with the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.} State and Federal
legislative committees have taken notice of the Communist links to
some of the militant groups.

6. In many ways this information is illuminating, yet in other :
ways it presents the problem of careful evaluation, Mcat certainly,
all past members of the Student Nonvioleat Coordinating Committes
cannot be charged with being « threat to the Nation's internal security, —
whereas those who support the statements and activities of the present
leadership of SNCC nmst remain suspect. Similarly, those who have

adhered to the tenets of the Revolutionary Action Movement, even from rae :

its early days, must be considered more than suspect. !
2. Because of this matter of ‘degree’ of involvement in the ;
unfavorable, indeed dangerous, aspects of ' black power," this office ”
has compiled from its records those personalities (Tab A), and argenis
zations (Tab B) which must be of our official concern. Two organi«s.
tions which have to date resisted the blandishments of ' black power!

new group to oppose CIA activities. Cur records prosently seem to
limit information on open attacks on CIA to the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Commiittes, the Afro-American Heritage Association,
and the Crganization of Afro-American Unity, the latter being the
organization founded by the late Malcblm X, Little, and to individuals
affiliated with a number of militant groups. Should information be reo
ceived which significantly supplements that contained in the attachments
to this memorandum, you will be advised.

Leadership Confarsnce which the Joint Legislative Committes
on Un-American Activities, State of Louisiana, reported on
13 Apri? 1964 to ba "substantially undor the control of the

spoken critics of U.S. Vietnam policy. Dr, King is known to
have two advisors who wera identified in the past with the Com-
munist cause, and his deputy, Rev. James Bevel who heads
the National Mobilization, has been quoted aa stating "every
thinking American” should be a mamber of the Communist
Party. Dr. King more recently has proposed extended civil
disobedience in Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1968. AI-
though Dr. King has participated in “peace” marches in the
past, he sent his regrets to the 21-22 October 1967 Pentagon
protesters, indicating that he would have attended if other
commitments had not precluded it.

munist Party through the influence of the Southern Conference Educa

Is notes that Wasbington, D.C. has a large, well-established, re-
sponsible Negro middle class which has a stabilizing influence on

the entire Negro community. It algo notes the dispersal of problern
areas and the intensive awareness and concern of Governrnent
officials and community loaders for what occurs in the city, The
report observes, however, “storm clouds gathering on the horizon."
The report notes: "Were it not for the continuing presence of
Stokely Carmichael in Washtngton and the mags civil disobedienca
demonstration that Martin Luther King hae planned for the Nation's
Capital this spring, the racial cituation in the District cf Columbia

“ could be viewed with some measure of optimism when compared

with the prospects In some sther major American citles... But
Carmickiel's current organizing activity and King's scheduled
demonstration bode itl for this city." “The immediate threat to
Washington, " continues the analysis, "is posed by King's project. "
It notes that the line between civil disobedience and violence is pre-
carioualy thin and can be crosesd over all too easily. "There is
danger," it notea, “that the demonstration will get out of control

or that extremists will seize the project and take over its direction."
The King demonstration, states the report, 'conetitutes a grave
threat to peace and order in this city." The FBI study also reas

a "long-range peril to Washington” in Carmichael's efforts to
exeate & Black United Front. Carmichael's aberrant personality
and his dedication end commitment to the use of violent action to
destroy American society, the report concludes, ‘'can have only a
polarizing and poisoning effect on race relations in Washington.

He is @ potent menace to the racial tranquility of this city." The
dotatled FBI study ts attached as TAB B.

received which reflects on the potential for civil disturbance tn
