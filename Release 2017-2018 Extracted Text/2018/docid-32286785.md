up with SAM as he can see no advantage to the MC GUIRE trio

to have PHYLLIS going with SAM. He stated SAM is no good

for the MC GUIRES. (U)

He stated PHYLLIS met SAM about three years ago

in Las Vegas when she was very "down in the dumps" as she

needed $28,000 very badly. At this time she started running

with SAM and he stated now PHYLLIS appears to be "power crazy"

and knows the only way for power is to have money. He 'said

SAM does give her money, but he does not know how much.

Likewise, SAM also gives

her presents, but he does not know

the value of these presents. (U)

He said SAM GIANCANA is trying to break up the

trio. He keeps making sly remarks of their act with his

purpose being to get PHYLLIS to do a solo. He tells PHYLLIS

that he can make her a big movie star by herself if she will

only leave the trio. MURRAY KANE is the manager of the MC GUIRES

and has been for many years. The MC GUIRES make about $600,000

per year and this means about $58,000 per year for MURRAY KANE.

He feels sure that MURRAY KANE would be most happy to have GIANCANA

out of the picture. (U)

Concerning the recent travels of GIANCANA, WILLIAMSON

stated that the MC GUIRE sisters appered at the Cave in Van Couver,

PHYLLIS there. They stayed three or four days when PHYLLIS and

SAM went to Las Vegas and Palm Springs, California., SAM had

obtained a part in FRANK SINATRA's movie "Come Blow Your Horn" for Wit

PhYLLis. SAM then went to Hawaii with _FRANK

went on to Pittsburgh. SINATRA is reportedly having trouble with

the Internal Revenue service, not beingable to show how he earned

all the money he is spending. _

LUCILL BAL (actress) IS

supposed

to have introduced SINATRA to a very wealthy widow, name unknown,

from Hawaii and SINATRA is considering marrying her to account

for the money he is spending. (W

PHYLLIS did not know GIANCANA was going to Hawaii

and became furious with him and called him and he then joined

the MC GUIRE sisters in Pittsburgh.

From Pittsburgh, they all

came to NYC arriving on Sunday, 5/19/63. GIANCANA stayed' at

PHYLLIS'

apartment, 525 Park Avenue, Manhattan. (U)

He stated GIANCANA left NY either Monday or Tuesday,

returning to Chicago.:

Concerning VIC COLLINS, WILLIAMSON said he is a

Canadian citizen now applying for a work permit in the United States.

COLLINS used to work with WILLIAMSON in Calgary and was a

good worker while WILLIAMSON was present, but when WILLIAMSON

left, did not do anything. WILLIAMSON,

therefore, fired

COLLINS although there are no hard feelings between them and

COLLINS went to the sisters and got a job as a general handy

man for them. He is presently staying at the Madison Hotel,

NYC, and is the one who got the ticket for SAM GIANCANA to

fly

to Chicago either Monday or Tuesday. (U)

Concerning his knowledge of GIANCANA, he said

GIANCANA does have a one-suiter suitcase which he takes with him

on his travels.

SAM usually carries quite a large sum of money.

He has never seen SAM obtainingmoney from people in the various

cities they have visited. (U)

He stated GIANCANA likes Italian food and while

in NY, will usually visit the Chambord Restaurant, the La Scala,

the 21 Club or El Morocco. He stated SAM usually stays at

PHYLLIS' apartment in NYC, although he has heard of him staying

at the Waldorf Astoria and also the Madison Hotel (U)

While in Miami, SAM will usually stay at the

Fountainbleau Hotel.

WILLIAMSON

said he once saw SAM giving

money to DUKE STEWART (ph), who is some sort of a manager at

the

Fountainbleau.

This was a secret kind of gift as SAM was

giving it to STEWARt in the basement of the fountainbleau.

He

also visits Sonkens and Puccinis in Miami. Another favorite

spot in Miami is Capras Restaurant on Biscayne Boulevard.

As a matter of fact; VINCENT CAPRA, on one occasions, while

SINATRA and GIANCANA were at the Fountainbleau, cooked a

number of meals for them and brought them from

restaurant to the Fountainbleau for them (U

his

Concerning Las Vegas, WILLIAMSON stated that at

one time he mentioned to PHYLLIS that it appeared that Jews

had the upper hand in Las Vegas. PHYLLIS stated that this is

not true, it just appears the Jews run things, that in reality,

the Italians run it and put the Jews up as a front. (V)

SAM also supposedly owns the Cal-Neva. The Riviera

in Las Vegas, according to PHYLLIS, is also controlled by the

criminal element. (U)

On one occasion, PHYLLIS did state that due to

the pressure from federal authorities, it is difficult for

"members of the mob" to meet and

she related that

sometimes they rent a hearse and meet in the hearse. (U)

WILLIAMSON stated he himself is going to leave

NYC and return to Calgary on either 5/25 or 26/63.

He stated

He will

calls from Calgary and if so, will furnish the numbers to the

agents. (V)

In view of the above, WILLIAMSON was considered a PCI

and a case was opened in the NYO: (U)

On Saturday, 5/25/63, PCI LOWELL WILLIAMSON telephonically

contacted SA DONNELLY at home through the NYO switchboard.

He indicated somebody else was with him and could not talk

freely.

However, he indicated GIANCANA had telephonically

contacted PHYLLIS MC GUIRE on Friday, 5/24/63 and was in

the

Dominican Republic (this was subsequently verified) (W

On 5/27/63, SA DONNELLY received a letter at the

NYO in a Regency Hotel envelope (residence of WILLIAMSON

in NYC) containing the schedule of appearances of the MC GUIRE

sisters up until 9/2/63. V)

It is believed by the NYO that WILLIAMSON would be an

excellent source of information concerning the travels of the

MC GUIRE sisters and knowledge of GIANCANA's presence with them,

WILLIAMSON did not express any fear of GIANCANA to the

agents and it is believed that WILLIAMSON accöuldot be best

directed by agents of the Chicago Office or the NYO due to

their knowledge of GIANCANA. However, any contact with

WILLIAMSON must be most discreet. (U)

Therefore, it is suggested the Kansas City Office

recontact ROBERT

MARTIN and attempt to have him have

WILLIAMSON contact agents of the ÑYO or Chicago Office when

next in one of these

reinterview him. (V

cities and arrangements can be made to
