NCRICN is a con man, and U.S. Air Force Medical records have re-

veaied that he was discharged lo July 1950 as a result of psychlatric

problems, having tried on two or more occasions to commit suicide.

NORTON's lles about CIA firat appeared in th Vancouver Sun go 5

about the use of the Sun in other surfecings of WHORDER propaganda

the Sun and representatives of Soviel Intelligence? I Do such information

is at hand, it would be appreciated ll these questiona were forwarded to
