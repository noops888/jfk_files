@1 i, Reference forwarded a CI/R&A memorandum about NORTON
to[Chief of Station, Cttowal. Since that date FBI reports have shown that
NCRTCN is a con man, and U.S. Air Force Medical records have re-
vealed that he was discharged in July 1950 as a result of psychiatric
problems, having tried on two or more occasions to commit suicide.
NGRTON's Hes about CIA first appeared in th(Vancouver Sun yn s

2. The attached FEI report,| DBB 77295.NiC April 1967, concerns
another example of disinformation bppearing in couver, involving the

a result of a right-wing conspiracy involving CIA.

4. The surfacing of two such allegations in or through the Vancouver

Sun seems to place a strain on coincidence. Deo you kave any information
absut the use of the Sun {in other surfacings ofc RDER propaganda
against CIA? Is there eny {uformetion about contac y between employees of
the Sun and representatives of Soviet intelligence? If no such information
is at hand, :it would be appreciated if these questions were forwarded to
\) (ihe Station, Although Headquarters bas no record of Trevor LAUTENS,

it is conceivable that[Station}files may also hold taformation about him.
