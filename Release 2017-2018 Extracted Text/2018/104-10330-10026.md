MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, JFK Assassination Records Review Board

FROM:

David Cohen

Deputy Diractor for Operations

SUBJECT:

Release of JFK Documents

1. I understand the JEK AARB is presently congidering the

release of documents which would identify CIA stationg to the

public.

I am opposed in general to revealing the locations of

our stations and would prefer instead to substitute the station

name with

a regional designation, e.g. European Station vice

Brussels. I would be willing, however, to open certain stations

during a specific window of time if they are substantively

relevant to the assassination investigation and provided that the

documents in question are sanitized to conceal the permanent

i presence of the station? (S)

2.

In all but a handful of instances, public acknowledgment

of a station would be a political embarrassment to the host

government and would threaten ongoing aensitive operations and

liaison relationships. In a few instances, the damage probably

would be minimal or not at all as long as the presence appears to

be temporary. I have surveyed the involved components and

determined the damage to national security which would follow

such release. (S)

3. I strongly urge that you not allow the information

regarding the Congo and

_to be released.

The C

is now

Zaira and the station in the

60'g would have been in

Leopoldville, now Kinshasa L

4. Within the context of our European presence, I have the

following comments:

- Public acknowledgment would force the

government and liaison service to pay closer attention to

Station operationg and therafore present a threat to ongoing

sensitive operations. (S)

- A neutral country. Public acknowledgment

of a CIA station would embarrass the government and liaison;

thereby inhibiting the close and productive liaison

rolationships we now enjoy as well as presenting a threat to

ongoing sensitive operations. (8)

Paris - No additional damage. (8)

Bonn - No specific damage. (S)

Berlin - No specifio damage. (8)

- Public acknowledgment would embarrass the

government and inhibit liaison cooperation; thus endangering

ongoing operations. (S)

- Public acknowledgment would draw questions

from the press and create political problems for the

government and liaison.

This would endanger the

continuation of seneitive joint operations. (S)

- Public acknowledgment would draw questiong from

the press and threaten very productive and very sensitive

ongoing joint operations. (s)

~ Publio acknowledgment would draw press

attention and embarrassing questions for the government and

liaison service, This would further damage an already

delicate liaison relationship which is vital to ua for

counterterrorism operatione. (s)

_ Public acknowledgment

would be politically embarrassing for the government and

liaison services.

This would likely endanger any

continuation of joint operations. (s)

- A

Public acknowledgment

would create political problems for the government and

liaison service and force greater attention to our

operations.

This would create an intensive

counterintelligence atmosphere for our operations; likely to

cause a decrease in our operations. (8)

London - No specific damage. (S)

Ottawa - No specific damage. (8)

5. Our Eastern European stations pose a unique problem when

we consider public exposura..

Station is recovering from

operating for almost fifty years in an undeclared status. During

the last three years we have managed, with much effort, to begin

the establishment of good working relations with the host

government and internal/extarnal services. As a result, the

station has recently begun some very sensitive and high-level

bilateral oparations. These obviously depend upon the good wild

of the host service.

The

citizenry came of age in an

atmosphere in which distrust of intelligence services in general,

and the CIA in particular, was thoroughly ingrained. That

distrust lingers in the public's mind even today. Exposure of

our station's previously undisclosed presence and operational

activities during the Cold War will necessarily raise questione

about our activities then, and almost certainly lead to further

inguiry about our present ralationship. It is doubtful that our

relationship, and certainly our very sensitive operations, could

withstand the resulting public debate. The existence of

station, past and present, cannot be surfaced at thie time

without serious damage to national security. (S)

6.

Public acknowledgment of our stations in Managua,

Ban Jose, Panama City, San Salvador, Santo Domingo, Buenos Alres,

Lima, Santiago, and Montevideo would not further damage our

operational capabilities in a specific sense. Overall, any

release of information about a clandestine service breeds

distrust in professionalism

7. We receive significant national colleation systema

support from

jeopardize this by releasing the presence of our station to the

public.

is a special case in that there is continuing

disagreement regarding our station. We should not complicate the

current "Spy Mania" atmosphere in

There have been two

incidents regarding our presence in

during the present

year. Any further disclosure would exacerbate the tension and

create an untenable operational atmosphere for our station and

personnel. (8)

8. Public acknowledgment of a station in

problem for the U.g. Government. U.S. andI

foreign

relations are always delicate; the L

Government is very

sensitive to parceived slights to its national sovereignty, and

public acknowledgment of a station would prove embarrassing to

the l

Government which in turn could ask that the station be

closed. If the station were closed or significantly downsized,

it would affect a large number of important intelligence

collection operations. (8)

11. In those instances where I have indicated damage to

operational capability and national security, I would feel

compelled to seek a reversal of any decision to make a publia

acknow.edgment.

In those cases where I indicate "no specific or

additional damage", I am prepared to accept your decision yet I

must call your attention to the general damage done to us by any

disclosure of operational presenco.

Our operational capabilities

are in direct proportion to the confidence placed in our ability

to protect source identities and operational methods. Disclosure

to the public of our presence weakens this confidence. (S)
