MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, JFK Assassination Records Review Board

FROM: David Cohen
Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Documents

i. I understand the JFK AARB is presently considering the
release of documents which would identify CIA stations to the
public, I am opposed in general to revealing the locations of
our stations and would prefer instead to substitute the station
name with a regional designation, e.g. European Station vice
Brussels. I would be willing, however, to open certain stations
during a specific window of time if they are substantively
relevant to the assassination investigation and provided that the
documents in question are sanitized!to conceal the permanent /

| presence of the station? (s) ~

oo 2. In all but a handful of instances, public acknowledgmant
of a station would be a political embarrassment to the host
government and would threaten ongoing aenaitive operations and
liaison relationships. In a few instances, the damage probably
would be minimal or not at all as long as the presence appears to
be temporary. I have surveyed the involved components and
determined the damage to national security which would follow
such release. (8)

: 3. I strongly urge that you not allow the information
regarding the Congo and to be released. The is now
Zaire and the station in the 60's would have been in
Leopoldville, now Kinshasa

5. Our Eastern European stations pose a unique problem when iH
we consider public exposure. Station is recovering from !
operating for almost fifty years in an undeclared status. During
the laat three years we hava managed, with much effort, to begin
the establishment of good working relations with the host
\ government and internal/external services. As a result, the j
\

station has recently begun some very sensitive and high-level
bilateral operations. These obviously depend upon the good will 5
i of the host service. The! citizenry came of age in an
il

atmosphere in which distrust of intelligence sarvices in general,
and the CIA in particular, was thoroughly ingrained. That
distrust lingers in the public's mind even today. Exposure of
our station's previously undisclosed presence and operational
activities during the Cold War will necessarily raise questions
\geevt our activities then, and almost certainly lead to further

'inquiry about our present relationship. It is doubtful that our
relationship, and certainly our very sensitive operations, could f

|| withstand the resulting public debate. The existence of a
Station, past and present, cannot be surfaced at this tima \
without serious damage to national security. (S)

\

|

6. Public acknowledgment of our stations in Managua, |
San Jose, Panama City, San Salvador, Santo Domingo, Buenos Aires,
Lima, Santiago, and Montevideo would not further damage our
operational capabilities in a specific sense. Overall, any
release of information about_a clandestine service breeds |

7. We receive significant national collection systems
support from which affects national system collection |
efforts against Tier IA targets throughout Asia. We would h
jeopardize this by releasing the presence of our station to the

public. is a special case in that there is continuing
disagreement regarding our station. We should not complicate the
current "Spy Mania" atmosphere in| There have been two

incidents regarding our presence in during the present !
year. Any further disclosure would exacerbate the tension and
create an untenable operational atmosphere for our station and
pergonnal. (8) |

8. Public acknowledgment of a station in would be a
problem for the U.S. Government. U.S. and foreign
| xelations are always delicate; the Government is very {

sensitive to parceived slights to its national sovereignty, and \
public acknowledgment of a station would prove embarrassing to
the Government which in turn could ask that the station be
closed, If the station were closed or significantly downsized,
it would affect a larga number of important intelligence
collection operations. (8)

to a public acknowledgment of a station in and might well
engage in harassment/sabotage/terrorist actions in| to
show its displeasure. If the Government should ask that
} our station be closed, the U.S. Government would lose a

capability to collect on stability, and

Muslim population, has a growing Islamic fundamentalist problem,
and Islamic fundamentalists are frequently opposed to the U.8. in
general and_the Agency in particular. Public acknowledgment of a
station in could cause ita Islamic fundamentalist
population to react negatively and demand that our station be
closed. If the station were closed, the U.8. Government would

lose intelligence on the conflict,

stability and Islamic extremism. (8)

11. In those instances where I have indicated damage to
operational capability and national security, I would feel
compelled to seek a reversal of any decision to make a public
acknowledgment. In those cases where I indicate "no specific or
additional damage", I am prepared to accept your decision yet I
must call your attention to the general damage done to us by any
disclosure of operational presence. Our operational capabilities
are in direct proportion to the confidence placed in our ability
to protect source identities and operational matheds. Disclosure
