Possible Identity ot Mexican KGB.Agent, (inu) MORA
Reterence: HMMW-1/142, 11 March 1969

1, Reterence asked tor any recent traces on Juan MIGUEL de
MORA Vaquerizo (201-239192), and whether he might be a personal
acquaintance of the tormer Mexican President, Adolto LOPEZ MATEOS,
in an effort to determine whether he might be the KGB agent, (1au)
MORA, descrived by AEDUNOR.

2, A careful review of the Station tile on Juan MIGUEL de
HORA Vaquerizo (please note that it has been determined that Suoject
uses "MIGUEL" as his patronym) has failed to reveal any close connec~
tions with Mexican government personalities, or his appointment to
Mexican government delegations (per Paragraph 3 of Reterence). While
Juan MIGUEL de MORA has been consistently pro-Leit, and anti-Mexican
Government, and has had contact with Soviet Empassy officials in
Mexico City, there has been no indication that he has any good
high-level government connections (other than what might be routine
press access), There was one<meeting (reported in HMMA-13323,
17 July 1959) among MIGUEL de MORA, Pavel YATSKOV (201-120123), then
stationed with the Soviet Lmpassy in Mexico; and a TOY Soviet
Mikhail Vegilyevich KREMNEV),.in June 1959 wnich could be
considered to bave had some puzzling clandestine overtones; \there is
nothing else, however, to conrirm that Juan MIGUEL de HORA is the
KGB agent ot the AEDUNOR report. As for@Juan MIGUEL de MORA's
recent activities, reference is made to @FPA}8899%, 15 January 1969;
HMMA-30427, 11 February 1969; and (OFFA Go15, 15 April 1969, which
reveal that MIGUEL de MORA is curréntly “residing in Paris and employed
by French radio/TV (ORTF).

3. On the other hand, a detailed review ot the thick Station
tile om Dolores DE LA MORA Cepeda (201-82/191) revealed several
traces wnitch Seem to fit the description oi Paragraph 3 of Reterence,
despite the assumption that the KGB agent reterred to was a male,

The tollowing points, which in the Station's opinion make Dolores
DE LA MORA a iar more credible candidate as the KGR agent, are
ottered tor Headquarters consideration;

a. Uolores DE LA MORA Cepeda is (or was at the time)
director and owner of "Nueva Provincia," a newspaper in Lagos
de Morenos, Jalisco, single and described as the youngest
director oi a newspapor (UGFA-12768, U December 1963). She
was also descrived as a tormer candidate tor deputy irom the
Third District of Jalisco (HMM-5853, 24 August 1961). More
recently she has been writing articlas tor "El Dia," “Siempre,”
and "Sucesos Para Todos," all well-known leitist publications.
(See MEXICO CITY 1175, 21 April 19u7, and MEXICU CITY 21b4,

-17 July 1907). In January 1965, Dk LA MORA married Luis

SANCHEZ ARREOLA, Iniormation Chiet of "1 Dia," but por LISAMPAN,

14 March 1968, she was divorcing her husband.

Since 1901, Altbougn sne is known to be triendly wita the

LIENVOY) contact with Czech Emba s

ao contact with Czeslaw LIMO! 2 Ylo), Lormer Second
Secretary jn the Polish assy > wn UB olficer, However,
zt is curious to note that through all the years or overt
regular contact witn such Cuvan and Bloc officials, there has
been a nuticeable absence ot similar cegular overt contacts

Gd, .Several reports in pecemper 1960-February 1961. involve
Delores DE LA MORAwith Munuel MARCUE Pardinas, leftist
publisher, and his wile, and Luis MONTER Valenzuela, According
to the reports, Dolores used her intluence in obtaining printing
paper trom the Mexican government-controlled agency (under the
guise ot buying tt ior her own Jalisco publication) for
MARCUL Pardinas' leitist publication, "Po ica." (NOTE; Luis

e. Dolores DE LA MORA, despite her known leftist contacts,
apparently has had some good high-level Mexican governoment ‘
connections. Per LIENVOY reports, she has been reterred to as
a relative ("partente") o1 Francisco GALINDO Ochoa, prominent
PRY official, who, until February 1968 when he was allegedly
lorced to resign by President DIAZ ORDAZ, was the Presidential
Press and Public Relations Otiicer. Also according to LIENVOY,
Subject has been extremely triendly with Julio SCHERER Garcia,
