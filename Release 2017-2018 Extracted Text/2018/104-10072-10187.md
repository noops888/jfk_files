Poseible Identity of Mexican KGB Agent, (Inu) MURA

ACTION REQUIRED - RIFERENCES

Reterence: HMMW-1/142, 11 March 1969

MICROFILM

Reterence asked tor any

recent traces on Juan MIGUEL de

MORA

Vaquer1zo (201-239192), and

whether he might be a personal

acquaintance of the former Mexican President, Adolfo LOPkZ MATEOS,

1n an

effort to determine whether he might be the KGB agent, (anu)

MORA, descried by AEDUNOR.

2. A carerul review of the Station lile on Juan MIGUEL de

MORA

Vaguerizo (please note that it has been determined that Suuject

uses "MIGUEL" as his patronym) has failed to reveal any close connec

tions with Mexican government personalities, or hie appointment to

Mexican government delegations (per Paragraph 3 of Reterence).

While

Juan MIGUEL de MORA has been consistently pro-leit, and anti-Mexican

Government, and has had contact with Sovlet Embassy officials in

Mexico City, there has beeu no indication that he has any good

high-level goverment connections (other than what might be routine

press access).

There me one meeting (reported in HAMA-13343,

17 July 1959) among MIGUEL de MORA,..

Pavel YATSKOV (201-120123), ther

stationed with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico; and a TDY Soviet

(Mikhal Veezlyevich KREMNEV).. In June 19S9

which could be

considered to have bad some puzzling clandestine overtones; there is

nothing else, however, to contirm that Juan MIGUEL de MORA is the

KGB agont o1

the AEDUNOR report.

As for Juan MIGUEL de MORA'S

recent activities, reference is made to OFPA-88992 15 January 1969;

HыMA-30426, 11 february 1969; and (OrPD=89615, 15 April 1969, which

reveal that MIGUEL de MORA 1a currently residing in Paris and employed
