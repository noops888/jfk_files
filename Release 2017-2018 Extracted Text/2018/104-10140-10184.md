Subcommittee staff, visited C&RS Conference Room this date in order to

review files.

was discussed with Mr. Hershman. (See Memorandum for the Record.)

8. (Unclassified - RJK) LIAISON Called Clare Buchanan, Senate

Foreign Relations Committee staff, and informed her that DOD could update

the background investigations of Seth Tillman and John Ritch, of the Committee

staff,if the Chairman sends a letter making such a request to DOD. She

and then Mr. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the

Committee, on security matters and a Nondisclosure Agreement. (See

Memorandum for the Record.) In addition, Chairman Stokes gave me a

The Commissioner's press secretary, Bernardo Guerra, indicated that he

was gathering general information on many agencies of the Executive Branch

and wished to visit the CIA with other members of the staff to "talk about the

CIA. " I responded that I thought the best way to start was to send him a general

kit of public information on the Agency, which hopefully would satisfy his

informational needs. A kit was provided by A/DCI/PA and forwarded to

the. Office of the Resident Commissioner, Puerto Rico, Attention: Bernardo

Guerra, Room 1319 Longworth House Office Building.
