WASHINGTON — The House Assassi-
i ite is focusing on a.small -
group of soutly St. Louis segregationists’
{hem now dead — In its
investigatior/of the murder of the Rev.
Luther King, committee

Commityee investigators say the. group
may hav beet the link between James
Earl Rgy, who pleaded guilty of the
murder, and-a St. Louis lawyer who may
“have-wanted King killed: -

Cramittee-sources, say-they consider
this avenue of investigation the most
promising explanation of 3 conspiracy
theory in the assassination-of the civil
tights leader in Memphis in:April 1968:
But they- acknowledge that .thus.far they
have little hard evidence to prove:it.

The theory revolves around-St, Louis
members of the Citizens.Council and the

George-Wallace for President campaign “

of 1968. Investigators have learned that
members of those groups lived and
worked in the vicinity of the former

Grapevine Tavern in the 1900 block of ©

pee a The taversy Which went
out of business in December 1968, was
operated:by.John Larry Ray, a-brother
of James Earl Ray, ~ | ;
Investigators believe that John H.
Sutherland, a St. Louis patent lawyer

This article was prepared by
William ‘Freivogel, Gerald M. Boyd
and Louis J. Rose of the ‘Post-Dis-
patch Staff.

and segregationist, contacted a south St.
Louis man involved with him in several
right-wing ‘groups conveying a money
offer for King’s murder. .At.the time the
man was canvassing businesses in the
neighborhood. of-the Grapevine-for the
Wallace campaign.

The committee’s theory is that the
man could have mentioned the offer to
John Larry Ray, who could have passed
it on to his brother. John Larry Ray
denied to the Post-Dispatch that any
‘such proposal was-made. Sutherland and
the other man are dead,

Gordon Baum, of St. Louis, field
director of the Citizens:Council, has been
subpoenaed to testify before the commit-
tee, and sources said other subpoenas
are likely.

Baum, who was-active in the work-of
the council and the Wallace campaign-in
1968, confirmed in.an interview that the
committee appears to be scrutinizing ~
persons who were connected with both
groups in that period.

He accused the committee of “a
systematic purge of right-wing groups in
St. Louis.”

The committee has held hearings on
the King assassination and plans to
continue them. in November. The panel
has heard testimony from Russell G.
Byers of Rock Hill that Sutherland and
another. man offered him $50,000 in 1967
to arrange for King’s murder. Byers said

, he tumed down the offer. :

Investigators believe that Sutherland

then contacted his acquaintance with the ”

Wallace campaign, who was canvassing
around the Grapevine, ae

The committee also has learned that a,
woman who was a top official. of the
Citizens Council and the Wallace cam-
paign lived in the 2100 block of Arsenal
Street, within 100 yards of the Grape-
vine.

The woman, who also is dead, often
had planning meetings of the two groups
at her home, The Wallace canvasser was
@ good friend of hers and together the
two shouldered most of the responsibili-
ties of the Wallace state headquarters.
The woman generally ran the office,

The first meeting of the council was’

account says Sutherland condemned the

At the second meeting, Sutherland -

brought his friend Thurman Sensing to

director of the Southern States Industrial
Council.on which Sutherland served as
board member. The group, now. called
the ‘United States Industrial: Council,
opposed civil rights laws in addition to
lobbying for industry legislation.

Sensing was an ultra-conservative who
said in.a speech after King was assassi-

‘, nated that the resulting rioting was the

civil rights leader’s fault.

Enclosed herewith are four copies of an LHM

. Former Agent BIDEWELL had previously been advised
in late July, 1978, by SA JAY ALDHIZER, FBIHQ, that
former Agént BIDEWELL might be contacted telephonically
by Mr. EBERHARDT of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations.

“Former Agent BIDEWELL, on 8/31/78, received a
telephone call at his home, 1116 Culverhill Drive,
Webster Groves, Mo. 63119, telephone: $962- 0972, from

September 7, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTER On ASSASSINATIONS.

Former.Agent Cletis B. Bidewell advised on
questioning that he had on at least one occasion inter-
viewed Carol Pepper, sister of Jamés Earl Ray, suspect
in the assassination of Doctor Martin Luther King in
Memphis, Tennessee. At that. time, Carol Pepper was.
residing in Maplewood, Missouri, and the unlawful flight
to avoid confinement case against James Earl Ray,
xesulting from his escape from the Missouri State
Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri, was assigned to
Special Agent (SA) Bidewell in the St. Louis Division.
At this time, no information had been developed indicat-
ing that James Earl Ray was a suspect in the murder of
Doctor King. segue

The interview with Carol Peppér was. most
frustrating since it appeared She was completely un-
cooperative in furnishing any information concerning the
possible whereabouts of James Earl Ray. ‘To the best
of his recollection, SA Bidewell advised that no other
Agent accompanied hin on this interview and two or three young
children, presumably children of Carol Pepper, were in the
home at the time of the interview. :

With respect as to how the lead to interview
Carol, Pepper was obtained, it was recalled by 5A Bidewell
that the lead was developed as a result of background
information furnished by the Kansas City Division,
office of origin in the unlawful flight to avoid confinement
case, To the best of his recollection, SA Bidewéll advised
that no information was obtained through the interview of

tion conducted by him failed to develop any information
indicating that James Earl Ray had been in the St.. Louis
area subsequent to his escape from Missouri ‘State
Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri.

SA. Bidewell further recalled that shortly

after his interview with Carol Pepper, James Earl Ray
became the prime suspect in the Doctor King murder and .
the casé on Jaites Earl Ray was reassigned to an Agent

who could give full time to this matter and no further
investigation was conducted in this matter by SA Bidewell,
other than to cover an occasional minor lead which was
developed during the course of the investigation,

CARL ROWAN:
SAMs EARL RAY, the FBI aiid DR. KING

WASHINGTON---Attorney Mark Lane’s verbal blasts
<at Rep. Louis: Stokes (D.-Ohio) and other members of
the House Select Committee on. Assassifations-Tmight
lead you to think that Lane really considers his client,
Jamés Earl Ray, 'to ‘be: the gteatest Victim: of political
oppression since Anatoly Shcharansky.

But don’t be misled by Lane’s frequent cries of
“McCarthyism” or his assertions that House members
were cheapirig onto the confessed killer of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. the worst abuses “‘in the history of
Congress.” 7 7 saucy :
"Understand that Mark Ta recerit
has-been devoted to imagining, and writing about, évil
conspiracies. He took Ray before-this. committee in the
Hope .of convincing the American public, if not the
Congress,,that Ray was coerced into confessing that he .
murdered King and into accepting a 99-year -term_ in
person, and that Ray was a pawn in an FBI plot to Kill
the noted Black civil rights leader.

There was a stormy suspension of Ray’s testimony
partly because, for all of.Lane’s voluble interruptions;
he and his client were faring badly.

Lane arrived at the hearings surely feeling that |
millions of Americans, especially the Blacks in
Congress, were predisposed to. believe .that former
FBI diréctor J. Edgar Hoover was somehow ‘behind
King’s killing. After all, hadn’t the Rev. Jesse Jackson
just stated:publicly that he. didn’t think 1 ‘Ray pulled the
trigger?

-But under intense questioning from Stokes, Ray
and his testimony dealt a blow to any notion that he
was an innocent patsy in a governinent conspiracy to
Kill King.”

, Ray said he had lied. deliberately to newspaper
feporters, TV interviews, book .writers and even his
own lawyers. But now he wanted the committee and
fhe world to ‘believe him when ‘he said that his
mysterious partner in crime, ‘‘Raoul,’”? probably shot

WASHINGTON (UPI) — James Earl Ray was back
behind bars Saturday and, barring an abrupt turnabot
whch his congressional “trial” resumes in Novemnbet,

appears destined to serve his full 99-year sentence fir
killing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. {
“ The House Assassinations Committee took Ray but
of his Tennessee prison and gave him the public forum
$ he has sought for years to plead his innocence despite a
i formal confession of guilt. But it also disclosed new
{ evidence that Ray and his attorney, Mark Lane, found
+ “most damaging.”

Two surprise developrnents Friday dealt severe
} blows to Ray’s contentions — a retired British police-
| man’s statement that Ray boasted of killing King short-

ly after his arrest in London in 1968, and the admission

of another witness that his support of Ray’s alibi was
fabricated.

Lane responded angrily to the written statement

4 from the policeman, saying he understood the officer

had been charged with corruption and fired in disgriice.

| tioning of Ray.

Scotland Yard later said the officer — Alexlinder
} Anthony Eist, now a pub owner — was found innocent of
j cy ina trial earlier this year.

When Ray reappears before the committee in No-
mber, questioning is expected to focus on whether he
vas part of a conspiracy rather than a lone killer. The
committee holds hearings in September on conspiracy
theories about the killing of President John F. Kennedy.

‘The three days of hearings produced:

— Testimony that Ray left Los Angeles in 1968 and,
paralleling King’s movements, went to Selma, Ala.,
Atlanta, and finally to Memphis, Tenn., where the civil
rights leader was killed by a bullet from the rifle Ray
admits he bought.

— Evidence that Ray was in Atlanta on April 1, 1968.

In an outburst that made his attorney wince, Ray
told the committee that if anyone could show that he

for the King case right here on TV." The committee
produced a woman, now 75, who said from a wheelchair
that she had made out laundry and dry-cleaning re-
ceipts to a man calling himself Eric Galt, an alias used
“by Ray, in Atlanta on that day.
— An admission of lying from the only living sup-
porter of Ray's alibi that Ray was at a Memphis serv-
ice station when King was killed.

who had first corroborated Ray's alibi. Cowden, a

commodity dealer, said he was more than 400 miles

‘James Earl Ray's younger brother, Jerry, came tor

hopes of dispelling accusations that he was involved in;
the 1967 holdup of the Bank of Alton.

Buc tie was given a cold shoulder by police and bank
officials, some of whom called Ray's visit a publicity
stuntist

Rafiarrived at the Bank of Alton about 10 a.m. and
said he would like bank employees who witnessed the
robbery to see if they could identify him.

“T didn’t rob this bank or any other banks,” Ray said.
“TI have been accused on national television of being a

PAUL'UTTERBACK, president of the bank, told Ray
the witnesses were.no longer employees of the bauks of
Altons

“{ Mas very surprised Mr. Ray came to the bank, -
Utterback said. “I really don’t know why he did it, or
whathe hoped to accomplish.’

“Thig whole thing was a publicity stuat,” said another
bank-official. “The cameras were rolling, so it was a
perfec} stage for him to say what he wanted.”

Ray! was implicated in the July 13, 1967 robbery in
statements made by Rep. Floyd J. Fithian, D-Indiana,
durifig testimony by James Earl Ray before the House
Assassinations Committee Thursday. Fithian said the
conviéted killer of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

ACCORDING TO ONE theory, James Earl Ray could

After a brief stop at the bank, Jerry Ray and a
television crew went to the Alton police station to deny

suspects in the holdup.

Ray told Lt. Walter Conrad that he was willing tg

By DENNIS. MeCARTHY ~~ RAY, HOWEVER, denied to the

committee that he had made such, 4
confession while awaiting extradi-
tion to the United States. a

“That's probably the most damag-
ing statement that’s been made
against me. . . admitting guilt on a
murder charge . . . It is false,” Ray
declared. . .

His attorney contended ‘that the_
allegations by former Inspector Al-
exander Anthony Eist, who is now
retired, are unreliable. t

Rep. Samuel L. Devine, R-Ohio,
read aloud a report on a recent
interview of Eist by the committee's
staff.

DEVINE QUOTED Eist as saying
that he was one of Ray’s guards
during the weeks of his incarcera-
tion in London and that Ray often
confided in him.

Committee investigators asked
Eist, who now.has a pub in Cam-
bridge, England, whether Ray had
admitted killing Dr. King. .
“Oh, no, no, no,” Eist replied, “He
didn’t actually:come out with it, but
it was there in the conversation that *-
he had done it.” : =F

At one point, Eist was asked, “Did
he express hatred for blacks?”

“Yes,” Eist replied. “There |
wasn’t any doubt at all... He.said ©
he was trying to get to Africa to

-shoot some more.” esac

EIST SAID Ray's ego was such} |
that he began describing the assassi}.
nation of Dr. King. ff

“He told me about a gun. He sail
he threw it away. He told me he had
left this place (where the shooting of
Dr. King’occurred), saw-a police:

Eist also said Ray boasted that he ©
could only be convicted of conspira-
cy — that authorities couldn’t prove ~
that he had fired the weapon that .
Killed Dr. King.

The former inspector quoted Ray ~
as saying that he thought he would
be sentenced to one to 10 years in
prison on a conspiracy charge. Eist
said Ray was happy about this
prospect, and hoped that it would be
concurrent with a 20-year sentence
he had been serving in Missouri.

RAY ESCAPED from the Missouri
State Penitentiary April 23, 1967. He
had been-convicted of robbing a St.
Louis supermarkt of $191 in 1959. a
p Eist-also quoted Ray as saying

at “For him to have shot a black
‘man of note in.certain parts of +
American would make him a natio!l-
al hero . . . He seemed absolutely
mad about publicity. He reqyly
wanted it.” 7

Ray predicted, according to Eist,
that he would receive $250,000 to
$500,000-for killing Dr. King because

* He would get them to go on TV and .
«he could write books .

After Davine read the interview
report, Ray charged that it showed
that the assassinations committee

” 3 “intends to crucify me.”

ABOUT THAT TIME, Lane re-
turned to the hearing room after
being away briefly and said he had

. made a call to a British lawyer.

He said the lawyer described Eist
as corrupt and “a disgrace to the
English police force,” and that he
had been forced to leave his job. for
unlawful conduct.

When Lane was asked after the
hearing how dependable the British
lawyer was, Lane replied, “How do

ACTING COMMITTEE
ChairmanRichardson Preyer, D-
N.C., promised that the committee
would explore the issue of Eist’s
credibility. It was announced that
Elst would be called as a witness.

Walter Fauntroy, the District of

KANSAS CITY (AP) — Former FBI

have no showing of any conspiracy,”
Kelley, whose agency investigated the
Killing of the civil rights leader, said
Friday. .

is as it was investigated by the FBI,”

Kelley said at a news conference. “If

"additional leads come up, they tradition-

been nothing to counter the original and

attorney charging the federal agency
was behind a conspiracy to kill Dr. King. 7

Persisting, Stokes then asked Ray to
trace his travels after leaving Los
Angeles and Ray said that he had gone
to New Orleans and then to Birmingham
and finally to Atlanta. His statement
says that after leaving Los Angeles he
went to New Orleans, to meet the person

+ named Raoul.
* Ray said that he arrived late and was
instructed to go to Birmingham. After
meeting Raoul, the pair went to Atlanta,
4 Ray said. .

Stokes, however, pointed out that on
the automobile trip from New Orleans to
Birmingham Ray had spent the night in

-* a hotel in Selma, Ala. A map offered into
_* evidence showed that Selma is not on one
of two direct routes between the two
* cities. :
. Stokes then showed newspaper articles
that pointed out King had been in
«Camden, Ala., which is near Selma,
- about the same time that Ray was in
y Selina. -
Ray said, in response, that he had
» taken a wrong road after leaving New
Orleans and had decided to spend the
= -night in Camden-because it-was dark.

In perhaps the most damaging evi-
dence offered, Stokes offered testimony

}, and a cleaner’s receipt that indicated
"that Ray was in Atlanta at leas until
*“ April 3. The evidence contradicted Ray’s

Ray has admitted picking up th
clothes the day after King was assassi-
nated and has said that he fled then to

Canada. * .

‘Irying to emphasize the significance of
Ray being in Atlanta in early April,
Stokes read from the transcript of a

Ray said that such evidence would be
damaging.

“If I left Los Angeles planning to

of the Post-Dispatch Vou

WASHINGTON-The House i
nations Committee has submitted evi- -
- dence that shows that James Earl Ray
was in at least four cities at the same
time as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. in the months prior to the killing.of
King.

Testifying under oath today, Ray
denied that the evidence was any more
than a.coincidence. The last city where
e two were in together was Memiphis,

2 Ray, the confessed assassin of ine,

‘| ing in-an apparent attempt by commi-
'] tee members to dissect a carefully pr}

pared 40-page statement that he hy id
velivered Wednesday. 7

Ray appeared nervous at several

+ points in the questioning and his attor-
ney, Mark ‘Lane, repeatedly objected to
the way some of the questions were
phrased.

Committee chairman Louis Stokes,
D-Ohio, who did all of the questioning,
submitted evidence that showed that
Ray had been in Los Angeles, Selma,
F Ala., Atlanta and Memphis during tie

| same time periods as King. Lengtly
questioning by Stokes attempted to chil.

committee under oath and in newspaper _

Stokes, at one point, asked Ray jf he:

~ Los Angeles in February 1968. Ray had”
told the committee Wednesday that his
original destination had been New Or-
leans but that he changed his plans when, .
en route there.

After answering “no” today, Ray”
seemed shaken as Stokes introduced into
evidence a change-of- address form filled
ae by Ray in Los Angeles and showing
that his mail should be forwarded ‘o

Atlanta general delivery. id

The form said the mail should be”

Stokes asked Ray if he had known
that King had been in Los Angeles while
Ray was there. He said that he had not.
Persisting, Stokes then asked Ray to

faa the committee recessed for
lunch, . -

Trying to emphasisize the signifi-
cance of Ray being in Atlanta in early
April, Stokes read from the transcript of

a television interview with Ray in which
Ray said that such evidence would be
damaging.

“If T left Los Angeles planning to
»return to the Deep South, then I will take
+ responsibility for the King assassination
right now,” Ray said, in a “60 Minutes”
television interview. Ray told the com-
» amittee that he could not recall why he
\had made that assessment.

Ray, who pleaded guilty to the mur-
‘er of King in March 1969, has contended
since then that he did not commit thi

Stokes assailed Ray’s statement to
the committee that his unfound and
never fully identified accomplice had
never handled the .30-06 rifle that is be-
lieved to have been the weapon used to
kill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
on April 4, 1968. Z so
Ray said he had bought the weapon
for a man named Raoul in Birmingham,
Ala., for what he thought was a gun-
running scheme. Ray said he and Raoul
had worked together for months, from
Canada to Mexico, in various smuggling
deals. -

Ray said that if he had killed King,
his fingerprints never would have been
found on the murder weapon.

“1 would have wiped my fingerprints
off the rifle if I knew it was going to be
used in a Serious crime,” Ray said. He
insisted that even as a petty criminal he
‘was too smart to leaye his prints behind.

It was suggested that he did not have _
time to wipe his prints off the rifle be- ¢
cause he was-in-a-hurry to flee the scene

jof the shooting. ‘

1 “Usually you do that (remove the
pints) beforehand — before the crime,”
SRay said. “There are several things you
can use to prevent your fingerprints
from getting on the rifle. Every novict
knows enough to keep your fingerprints,

Raoul’s fingerprints doa't exist on that
* tifle at all, doesn't that indicate that

Raoul doesn't exist at all?” Ray was
+ asked.

“It doesn’t to me,” Ray replied.

. Ray admitted earlier today that he
had given conflicting stories to House
investigators, but said these “small
errors” do not dispute his denial that he .
shot King. :

Ray said the initial testimony he gave
to-committee staff members at Brushy
Mountain Prisonin Tennessee was not

+ based ona thorough review of the case.
“It was my intention to tell the
truth,” Ray said. “I wanted to be as
factual as possible because of the prob-
‘s lem of (my) credibility. There have been
\ some.small errors in details. Some con-
fusion in dates.” * r
Ray said in his opening testimony

Wednesday that he never shot King and

was several blocks away from the mur-

der scene having his car serviced at a
jas station at the time King was killed,
$ Ray told investigators in Tennessee

‘ , [hat he returned the first rifle to a sporty’

testimony Wednesday, Ray said Raoul

ought Thad purchased the second rijle

said. : .

‘ Ray had no hard answers. ‘‘Possibly

seen him in Raoul’s company, he said.
| 7 But.he couldn’t be sure. And he men-
tioned no one in Montreal, where he al-
“leged he had met the man. -
\ “Mr. Ray, I say to you, this coi
inttee has reviewed every FBI docu}.
ment relative ¢o this case, every othei
investigative document, and nowhere i i

: théye a reference to a man named

Raul,” Stokes said. 4
To that, Ray replied only that pers
haps not all documents had been fourd

Stokes: “If we can’t find Raoul, we
can’t help you very much, can we?”
Ray: “I think the only thing that

The proceedings -were- interrupted
and delayed over and over when Ray’s
attorney, Mark Lane, a longtime postu-
lator of conspiracy theories in the King
and“John F. Kennedy assassinations,
objested to the course of the questioning.

Lane repeatedly complained of not
having transcripts and other documents
related to the interrogation. “This is not
an investigation by (the late) Sen. Jo-
seph R.) McCarthy’s hearing,” he cried.
“We demand the common courtesies due
any defendant in a court of law.”

he asked for, but Rep. Richardson Prey- *
er, D-N.C., the acting chairman, ap-
peared to be losing patience with Lane's
tactics. “This is not a court of law," he
said.j‘Your role as counsel is simply to
advise your client of his constitutional
rights.” 3

from a South St, Louisan known as the
“Cat Man” after the breakout, i
In a statement which he read to the

He said Gorwin got the pistol for $200
from “‘a fence in East St. Louis.” ‘
Ray, the star witness in the commit. ¢
tee’s hearings .on the April’4, 1968,
assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin +
Luther King Jr., gave this account of his .
escape from the penitentiary in Jefferson }
‘ty: ‘

-}SEVERAL DAYS prior to the escipe,

feet which would fit inside a box usell to
trlinsport bread outside the prison.”

pammer and nails to punch holes in the
x.

“On April 23, 1967, I entered the prison
kitchen early — 1 worked afternoons —
at approximately 8 a.m.” :

Later, he said, he got into the box and“
covered himself with the board he had
Prepared. Then another prisoner filled
the box with bread and the box was

Ray said he spent the night in a fink i
cdr he found on a rural road, :

‘At this time, he said, he had with him
several candy bars, some bread he ltad
taien from the truck, $250 in cash, 2
radio and a Social Security car in the
name of John L. Rayns.

He said he began walking the next
night. His shoes finally fell off and he
“had to make a forcible entry into a
store to obtain another pair,” he said.

Ray said he was heading in the general
direction of Kansas City, but on the iixth
diy after his escape, he hopped a freight
tr}in to St. Louis.

“WASHINGTON — A court order to *”

protect James Earl Ray, the convicted

. killer of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
from prison abuse while he is waiting to
testify at sessions of the House assassi-
nations committee was issued Wednes-
day, his attorney said.

Earlier the attorney, Mark Lane, had
accused guards at the Federal Correc-
tional Institution at Petersburg, Va., of
beating Ray Monday night and putting
him-in a tiny punishment cell where
lights burned 24 hours a day.

“The lights will be out in Ray’s cell
tonight so he can sleep,” Lane said after
he won an order from U.S. District -

Judge William ‘B. Bryant here for Ray
“to be taken out of the hands of prison *
Officials and put in the’ hands of U.S.

marshals,” a

LANE SAID government lawyers

had opposed issuance of the order.
. _ US. Marshal J. Jerome Bullock, in
charge of holding Ray for the, House
‘committee testimony, said his under-
‘standing was that three marshals will
. now have to watch Ray themselves rath- *
er than leave him under the care of pris-
* onofficials.

Bullock said this did not necessarily
mean that Ray would have to be trans-
ferred from the Petersburg prison —
only that marshals must watch him di-.
rectly whether he is kept there or some-
where else. .

«Ray was taken to the federal prison
from Brushy Mountain State Prison in
Petros, Tenn., where he is serving a 93-
year sentence for the slaying of Dr. King
‘on April 4, 1998, plus an additional one-
to two-year term for escape.

LANE SAID RAY told him that he

was beaten at the Petersburg prison,
, Where he is being held under the nam
‘ «Michael Brewer,” because he objected
to being photographed. q

Ray balked at being photographed
because he was wearing old clothes at
4 the time and didn’t want photos of him to

: be “sold to the press,” Lane said.
1. The attorney said that when someone
“tried to take a picture, Ray jumped to

Mark Lone
Ray’ 's. attorney

his feet and two prison guards grabbed
him.

“One gave him a rabbit punch in the
back of the neck and another ripped his
shirt,” Lane said,

The attomey said a federal marshal 7

pulled both guards away.
Lane quoted Ray as saying he had not.
eaten in 24 hours because he feared that

. Officials would put something in his food

“to deter the function of his mind” in
advance of his public testimony Wednes-
day before the House committee.

THE ATTORNEY SAID Ray also
told him that he couldn’t sleep because
of the burning lights in his cell and a
headache from being punclied.

Bullock denied that Ray had been
beaten. He said Ray resisted a routine
fingerprinting procedure and marshals
insisted that he must submit to it.

But there was no sculfling or beatilig

+ during the incident, Bullock said.

Michael Aun, 2 spokesman for pe

” federal Bureau of Prisons, denied

+ Ray had been injured. Aun said an off
* cer was kicked and another elbowed in
the mouth during a struggle with Ray.

Ray blames guilty plea

By DENNIS J. McCARTHY
Globe-Democrat Staff Writer

WASHINGTON — Convicted assassin
James Earl Ray swore Wednesday that
if he had been given a trial, he would
have testified that “I did not shoot
Martin Luther King Jr.”

Ray told the House assassinations

after entering a guilty plea in 1969, Ray
recanted — but his statement before the
committee was the first time he had*
‘outlined his case publicly under oath.
“In respect to the guilty plea. . . it is
not a difficult matter for an attorney to
maneuver his client into a guilty plea

« « especially when the attorney has the
active cooperation of the judge and
prosecutor," Ray testified as eight feder-
‘al marshals stood around him.

The 50-year-old Ray, in a soft Souther
staccato, spent more than an hour
reading a 38-page prepared statement in
which he declared his innocence in the
shooting of Dr. King, but admitted his
guilt ina series of other crimes including

+ robberies and smugeling.

HE OFFERED AS conclusive proof of
innecence his oft-repeated declaration
that he was at a service station in
Memphis, having a tire repaired, at the
time Dr. King was gunned down on a
balcony in front of Room 306 at the
Lorraine Motel.

Ray hinted in his statement that a mati
he identiired as “Raoul” may have been
the killer of Dr. King, an allegation he
has made before,

He said he and Raoul met in a tavern
in Montreal in July 1967, about three

i. » Ray said Raoul indicated he could
obtain papers for Ray to leave Canada
. for Europe or Africa. But first, Ray said,
Raoul asked for his help in smuggling
“certain items” of contraband which
q Ray did not specify.
He said that he and Raoul smuggled
contraband from Canada into the United
States, and from the United States into
> Mexico.
RAY SAID THAT early in 1968, Raoul
told him to buy a rifle as a sample for a
gua-running operation into Mexico, and
that he bought a rifle in Birmingham,
~ Ala.

+ This rifle, Ray testified, was later
exchanged by him for a 30.06 Remington
rifle identified by authorities as the

Shooting Dr. King.

Dr.-King was assassinated at p.m,

‘Raoul arrived sometime after 4 p.m.

Ray said his first lawyer, Arthur J. «
Hanes Sr., “had me enter into a series of
literary contracts with him and William
Briord Huie ... in order, MerHanes,
said, to finance a Jury trial...”

In November 1968, Ray' said, his ,
brother, Jerry W. Ray, visited hin. in?
prison and told him that Huie had“
offered $12,000 “if I would not take the$ zt
witness stand.”

Ray quoted Huie' as saying any trial"
testimony (by Ray) would “destroy the
literary value of the book” on the King
slaying which Huie was writing at the
time, ,

“Consequently,” Ray said, “when Per-
cy Foreman, a member of the Texas bar,
appeared at the Memphis jail a few days
later and visited me, I agreed with Mr.
Foreman’s suggestion that I fire Mr.
Hanes and hire Foreman.”

} Ray said Foreman “then promised me,
jand later the trial judge, that if I
lretained him in the case, he (Foreman)
would not become involved with Huie.”

This promise, Ray said, was of a)

~ess"short duration. “ih

IN JANUARY 1969, Ray continued, |
Foreman gave him a $5,000 check from®
Huie for endorsement and told Ray he
needed the money to hire a lawyer to
assist him.

Ray said that in February 1969, Fore- ”
man got another $5,000 check from Huie.

“This'time,” Ray said, ‘he did.not

bother to have me endorse it. He just
forged my name to it and cashed it in
complicity with Planter's Bank of Mem-
phis,”

Ray said that “after collecting all the
money that was available from Huie (the
$10,000), attorney Foreman then com-
menced on Feb. 13, 1969, maneuvering
me into a guilty plea.”

He said that among Foreman’s argu-
ments was one that “it would in some
manner be in my financial interest td:
plead guilty as charge

Another argument used by Foreman,
Ray said, was that “the trial judge (W. |

WASHINGTON — James Earl Ray’s lawyer charged
today that federal prison officials and guards beat his
client and put him in a hot, tiny punishment cell with
the lights on 24 hours a day,

Attorney Mark Lane said the incident occurred
Monday night at a federal penitentiary some distance
from Washington. A spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons acknowledged a struggle had taken place and

.. Said the lighting problem had been solved, but denied
that Ray had been injured. bd

Ray, who is serving a 99-year state prison term in
Tennessee for the slaying of civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr. in 1968 and an additional 1- to 2-year
term for escape, testified today before the House assas-
sinations committce under high security.

Lane said in an interview that he visited Ray at the

: prison Tuesday night and that he was “pale and shak-
} ,ing and looked haggard, as if he had not slept at all.’
Lane said Ray told him that prison officials and

* \guards had punched him in the back of the neck,

knocked him to the ground and tore his shirt when he
objected to being photographed, then put him in the
cel

‘He said Ray also reported that he had not eaten in 24

thing in his food “‘to deter the function of his mind” at
the hearing. He said Ray told him he could not sleep
because of the lights and suffered a headache from
being punched.

Lane said that a Memphis attorney would file a writ

of habeus corpus today to have Ray removed from the }

federal prison cell where he is being held.

‘The writ, he said, will charge that Ray “is being held
in a punitive, solitary confinement cell with lights on
him 24 hours a day. Lane said the writ ‘would also con-
tend that “the temperature in the cell seemed to be
excess of 90 degrees.” 1

Lane said U.S. marshals had told Ray he would not
have tc be photographed but prison officials did so
anyway and Ray objected.

Michael Aun, a spokesman for the Bureau of Pris-
ons, denied that Ray was injured. He said that one offi-

a cer had been kicked and another elbowed in the mouth
"during the struggle. i
The identity of the prison where Ray is being hell!

i, has not been disclosed. That prison has a policy of pht-
tographing and fingerprinting all inmates with a hist¢-

ry of escape, but the processing of Ray was halted after

the scuffle, Aun said.

3 beg testify until 5 p.m. The committee

i os a quick meeting and decided’ to
adjourn,

f° “We didn’t want it to be said that he
(Ray) was not fresh and able to testify,”
said Rep. Walter E. Fauntroy, D.-Dis-
trict of Columbia. ’

: Ray is scheduled to continue his testi-

‘mony tomorrow and Friday.
Among the statements made by Ray
is morning in his prepared text were:

— That he had escaped from the
Missouri prison alone and without the
help of anyone outside. Ray said he had
hidden in a bread box and had left the
prison in a truck that was making a de-

' livery, +
— That he had $250 in cash when he

in St. Louis he had gone to Chicago

where he worked as a dishwasher for

several months, - = ~ .

— That he purchased a car and drove
to Canada from Chicago, staying in
Montreal. It was in Montreal that he
first met Raoul, who indicated that he
could obtain for Ray illegal passport
documments in return for Ray engaging
> ‘in smuggling activities for him.

- — That thé subsequent association

with Raoul included meetings in several

USS. cities including Atlanta, Birming,

ham and New Orleans. The final meet-

ing, Ray said, took place in Memphis the
day before King was killed,

i, Ray, who-read_rapidly from-the-pre-
pared statement, seemed to embrace a
conspiracy theory behind King’s assassi-

« Ration, in which he said he had no part.

« He said that Raoul had paid him to pur-

‘chase a high-powered rifle in Birming-

ham, supposedly to show some “par-
ties” in New Orleans who were intérest-

* ed in gun smuggling.

» Ray said after buying the rifle, he
gave it to Raoul and never saw it again.
Ray's fingerprints were found on a high-
+ powered rifle, which is believed to have.

+ bein the murder weapon,

- Ray offered explanations for several

» othjr elements that seemed to implicate

2 .escaped, and that after stopping briefly”

him in the assassination. He said, Wr -
example, that Raoul had asked him to
buy a pair of binoculars on the day as- _
sassination, and also had him register
under a fictitious name at the rundown
> boarding house. ua
A Ray fingerprint was also found on
the binoculars, and a man at the board-
ing house identified Ray as having fled
from the house shortly after King was
shot. Ray said he had left several per-
sonal items, including a blanket, in the
rooming house with Raoul when he left .
fordinner. =~ o ia
Several black civil rights leaders and
persons close to Ray who have sought a
new trial have contended that Ray could
< not have fled from Memphis and jour-
neyed to Canada, England and Lisbon
without outside help. His escape has
given rise to the possibility of a conspir-

acy. * 1
Sat during his testimony, Ray denied
having any assistance in his escape. He
said after leaving Memphis he went to
Atlanta, where he boarded a bus for
Detroit. He then took another bus to °
Toronto, where on his own and using
false identity, he managed to obtain ht .
Canadian passport. ia
‘The passport, he said, enabled him
fly to London and later to Lisbon. He»
unsuccessfully sought to journey to,
Rhodesia, but could not obtain the neces-
sary visa. ,
At that point, Ray said, he returned
toLondon, wherehe was arrested. 2.
Ray, during the 90 minutes of his tes-
timony, attempted to explain why he
had pleaded guilty by harshly criticizing
his first two lawyers. 7
After his arrest in London, he hat
retained Arthur Haynes of Birmingham,

* but before his scheduled trial date he
dismissed Haynes and retained Percy
Foreman of Houston, Texas. Haynes and
Foreman, Ray said, were involved in a
contract with a writer who was doing a
book on the King assassination. Ray said
both lawyers had told him that a guilty
plea was desirable for the book.

Ray said that Foreman had told hin

—_P
that the press already had convicted
him’and that the government had a wit-

. Ness it had bribed who would say that

Ray had been seen leaving the boarding

house after the shot was fired,

‘Foreman argued also, Ray said, that

* unless he pleaded guilty, Ray’s brother,
Jerry, would be arrested on a conspira-
cy charge, and his father, George, would
have to return to prison. Ray’s father,
who Ray said was 70 at the time, had
escaped from an Iowa prison in 1930.

The testimony began in a verbal
exchange between Ray’s lawyer, Lane,

~ and several committee members. Lane
has accused the committee of trying to

. | Present evidence that would show Ray
guilty of the crime in an effort to cover
up involvement by the Federal Bureau

A Investigation.

. | Lane said that Ray had been beaten
y federal marshals before leaving
Memphis for Washington yesterday. A.
committee member, however, said such

, charges were out of order and were not

+ related to Ray’s testimony.

* During his testimony, Ray said sever-
al times that he thought the FBI had
arranged King’s assassination. He of-
fered no evidence, however. .

In another development, Lane, con-
tinued his attacks Tuesday on the HOuse
committee, calling for the disbarment of _
its general counsel, G. Robert Blakey,
and of its deputy counsel, Michael

~ Eberhardt,

Lane told reporters that Blakey,
Eberhardt and Conrad Baetz, a staff
investigator who is based in Madison-
County, Ill, had ‘suborned perjury,
criminally received stolen property,
monitored and tape-recorded telephone

“conversations and violated their own

* rules..."

The charges were similar to those
Lane made recently in St. Louis at a
news conference with Oliver Patterson, *
a Black Jack, Mo., man who says that he

. yt on Jerry Ray, a brother of

‘ay, for the committee. Patterson alleg- ~
is that he secretly tape-recorded tele-
: Fhone conversations with Jerry Ray,

INW 55215 DoclId:32989797 Page 60

i

aac —~——s,
Stole some letters sent to Jerry Ray by
James Earl Ray, and even stole strands
of Jerry Ray's hair —all at the behest of
Baetz.

The allegations prompted Blakey to-

- begin an investigation. Last week, he

announced that the preliminary finding
was that committee staff had done noth-
ing illegal.

But Lane said Tuesday that the
Committee had not checked with the
fersons making the allegations — Pat-
terson, himself or Susan Wadsworth, a
Florissant woman who says she partici-
pated with Patterson in some of his ac-
tivities. Therefore, Lane said he was
mystified by the clean bill of health. In
addition, Patterson said Tuesday he
taken — and passed — a polygraph ted

* on all his statements. He said he hild

requested the test last week of Chjis

Gugas, whom he identified as forniér *
head of the american Polygraph Associ- Fa
ation. 7 aed i

. Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

WASHINGTON — The shot that killed
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King could
‘have been fired from a bathroom win-
dow of a rcoming house across the street
from King’s motel or from a bushy area
ina yard behind the house, a pathologist
told the House Select Committee on

5 Assassinations today.

Ds. Michael M. Baden, the patholo-
gist, said there were no medical tests
which would be precise enough to rule
out either site.

The bathroom window has been cited
by prosecutors of James Earl Ray,”
King’s convicted assassin, as the site
from which Ray was alleged to have
‘shot King as he stood on the second-floor
balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Mem-
phis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968, F

However, according to some other
theories that have arisen about the
", murder, the fatal shot was fired by
someone other than Ray from the back
yard of the rooming house.

In another development, Mark Lane,
Ray’s attomey, raised new questions
about the Assassination Committee’s
investigatory techniques. Lane said he
had evidence that a St. Louis-area man
had been paid by two committee investi- i
 ggators to lie to Jerry Ray, James Earl |

Ray's brother, and to another man in an

, ¢ to. subpoena from the committee.
.” Lane said the St. Louis-area man had

. been instructed by investigators Conrad |
Baetz, a former Madison County, Ul,
sheriff's deputy, and Melvin Waxman to
tell Ray and the other man that he had
been subpoenaed and that they would
probably be subpoenaed, too. Lane said
the man flew to Atlanta to meet with the
pair and to learn whether they would
plead the Fifth Amendment, who their
lawyers were, and other information.

Lane, also an author, showed a re-
porter a copy of a check written to the
St. Louis man which carried the identifi-
cation “U.S. House of Representatives.”
Lane showed the reporter the check only +
on the condition that the man’s name not ;
be disclosed, He said that the man did‘,
not want publicity. i

The check was for $69. Lane said the *
man was paid $50 plus $19 expenses, H

Earlier this month, Lane created a |
small uproar when at a St. Louis press
conference he and Oliver Patterson of
Black Jack accused the committee of
commissioning Patterson to spy on Jer-
ty Ray. The alleged spying included

- valleged illegal taping of telephone con-
versations.

The allegations led to an investiga. ,
tion by the Assassinations Committee. R
Last week, chief counsel G. Robert Bla. j
key reported that “on the strength of a

‘Dr. Kine Seemed To Expect
‘Assassination; J Abernathy y Says

A Washington Correspondent
af the Post-Dispatch

WASHINGTON — The Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King was probably aware
that he would be assassinated and un-
derwent severe periods of depression in

- the months preceding his murder, the
Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, his chief lieu-
tenant in the civil rights movement, has
testified. :

Abernathy said that, over the last
four months of his life, King showed a
marked change in his mental state,
which seemed to indicate that he knew
that he would be killed.

| "By GERALD M. BOYD
t

He said that King had been harassed,

constantly by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and that neither -the FBI
nor other police authorities provided
adequate security for King, even though
they had been told that King was con-
stantly receiving death threats.

The charges against the FBI and the

description of King’s fast months
emerged as the key elements of Aberna-
thy's remarks today at a public hearing
of the House Select Committee on Assas-
sinations.
* Under continuous questioning from
the Il-member committee, Abernathy
said he had no evidence to substantiate
his belief that King knew that he would
be killed. But he said that he was certain
that King did know.

The testimony of Abernathy, which
included a moving description of King's
Jast hours, came at the start of five days
of hearings on the civil rights leader's
death. King was assassinated in Mem-
phis on April 4, 1963. James Earl Ray

was later arrested and confessed to the #

assassination.

Since his confession, Ray has denied:
ae the murder, He has sought 2)

ew trial and said that he would tell the
\real” story if a new trial ever was held.
Abernathy is the current head of the
Southern Christian Leadership Confer-
ence — the group King founded. He had

been a constant companion and friend of
King since 1955 and was with King when
he was fatally shot. H

Today’s testimony represented iin
attempt by several committee members
to determine King’s relationship with
the FBI and to determine whether the
agency knew about the assassination
plan in advance or failed to adequately
pursue leads in the case.

One committee member, Rep. Sa-
muel L. Devine, R-Ohio, said he hoped
the committee was not attempting to
dwell on the FBI at the expense of pursu-
ing other angles of the assassination.

‘Abernathy said that King was reluc-
tant to report death threats to the FBI.
He said that the slain civil rights leader
was aware, as early as 1955, that he was
a target of telephone tapping, electronic
bugging and other surveillance methods
of the FBI and other government agen-
cies.

“The FBI was aware-of some of the

- threats,” Abernathy said. “We did not
report all of them, because we believed
that the FBI was not interested in doing
anything about them. Some of the FBI,
agents were from the Deep cause and
were quite racist.

“Just because you take a person and), Hi
put a badge on him doesn’t change his
heart.” x

Abernathy said that King was aware
that then FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover,
had called him “the most notorious liar
in America.”

On the day before the assassination,
Abernathy said, a plane King was riding *
‘on was delayed for about an hour while
it was searched. Abernathy said he had
no idea who had ordered the precaution,

January 1968 the civil rights leader
seemed more concerned about his death,

“His attitude was altogether differ-

WASHINGTON — A House adminis-

because of allegations by a Black-Jack,

But the‘House subcorimittee believes
that the assassinations panel has enough
money to last through September, a

committee plans to ask Rep. Louis

nations panel, to testify before it.in Sep-
tember.

If the allegations are true, the source
said, it would mean that ‘taxpayers’ ~
‘ money had.been used for illegal purpos-

Jamés Earl Ray’s brother; sifting
through Jerry Ray's. belongings for let-
ters from his, brother, and. acquiring
samples of Jerry Ray’ ’s hair.

Patterson asserted also that he-had

3° The attorney for James Earl Ray,
convicted assassin of the Rev. Martity
Luther King Jz., says House investiga-
tors hired a Black Jack man to spy on
Ray's brother.

+ _ And, said attorney Mark Lane, inves-
tigators for the House Select Committee
‘on Asse’sination then gave the “spy”
answers — some false — for his official
testime yy.

Lane Was in St. Louis on Monday for
something of a three-ring circus of dis-
closures and allegations. In addition to
the charges about spying, Lane:

— Accused the committee staff of
using illegal means to gain evidence,
including wiretapping and thefts, all as
part of a “conspiracy” to prevent a fair
investigation into King’s death.

— Engaged in a mild shoving match
with a New York Times reporter and
accused the Times of being an unwitting
“transmission belt” for false disclosures
about ths, King murder. Lane main-
tained that committee investigators had
intentionally leaked the information to

the Times {o discredit Ray’s contention .

that, despite his guilty piea, he is inno-
cent,

Lane said he decided to make his alle-
gations public because, “Members of
Congress have not the faintest idea that
they are being betrayed by their own

; staff.” 4
(i A spokesman for the committee fait
Monday night only that the staff i
aware bf Lane’s contentions and that

‘we consider them serious. We will be
investigating,” Ray is expected to testi

q ‘is month, the spokesman said. .

‘| U.S. Rep. Harold Sawyer, D-Mich., a}
nlember of the committee, denied
‘Lane's contention that Ray was offered

publicly before the committee |
\

his freedom in exchange for an admis-
g Sion of guilt,
4} But he said Ray had been toldhat
| authorities in Missouri and Tennessee
{ would be asked to consider a reduiti
in Ray’s sentence if Sawyer was given
“hard evidence that others were in-

sok wows

volved 7° TNT B= semen
§ Sawyer defended the proposal. “Evy .

«» ‘ery prosecutor in the country does thig
at times to gain information,” he said. +
4 Such a deal is now almost impossible,
Sawyer said, because Lane “has just’

leliberately blown it” by discussing it
‘publicly.
. +4. The news conference was held in St.
© houis at the Hilton Inn near Lambert
Field, Its primary aim, Lane said, was
~ to explain the role of Oliver Patterson,
+ 34, of 12350 Old Halls Ferry Road, an
- alleged undercover agent for the com
j+ mittee who said he had become disen- -
* chanted with his job.

Patterson said he had once been an
informer for the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation and had been employed for,
‘the last few months by the House special
committee to spy on James Earl Ray’s
brother, Jerry, a friend of Patterson’s
{or several years.

He said his duties included tape-re-
! clrding telephone conversations with
Jerry Ray, sifting through Ray’s’belong-
ings for letters from his jailed brother‘
and even acquiring samples of Nerdy
Ray’s hair. i
In April, Patterson said, he appeared
Before the committee’s investigative
staff to answer questions about his un-
dercover work. “During that testimony,
.. "I was asked questions by a lawyer for
sthe committee named Michael Eber-
hardt, and on several occasions I was
handed written’ ‘answers’ to the ques-
~ tions by Conrad Baetz, a staff investiga-
tor.” Lear Sane)
Other staff members appeared to be
aware of what was happening, Patterson
, , Said, but “the stenographer apparentty
* * took the answers down as my own,”
- Patterson said he was told by Baetz
ito say that “I had seen Jerry Ray carry
, 4 gun — which is not true” and ‘to fay
something nice about” J.B. Stoner,.an
« jadvocate of white supremacy. ,

‘; Baetz, who lives in Madison County

ound is'a sheriff's deputy there, could not
} Abe reached for comment. .

to The Spying continued, Patterson said,
util he was told by an FBI agent and
2 itaetz that Lane had somehow learned of
the undercover work. “I was told that
slane or Ray might take retaliatory &c-
tion against me or my family,” he said.
=. Patterson said he was advised by
* Baetz to hold a news conference Sunday,
*, where he was to accuse Lane of being a
«homosexual and contend that his under-
| cover*work had reinforced James Earl
" Ray's guilt, f
“| The conference was postponed, Pat-
* terson said, after he and Baetz leamed
» of Pope Paul VI’s death. After a meeting
:With Lane, Patterson said he had a
-change of heart and decided to “tell the
a whole truth about the secret operation.”
5. ;Patterson said he was displeased
with the job, because the committee
sowed him $9¢0 and was “just going to
sx dump everything on me — the illegal
«Wire taps, the opening of mail, the
ty thefts, everything. I’m willing to take a
»a lie detector test, too,” he said.
* To lend credence to Patterson's sto-
ry, Lane displayed an armload of tapes,
‘id to be recordings of conversations
With several persons, including Baetz
& and a New York Times reporter. Lane
% said Patterson had been instructed to”
* leak” false information to the Times
gE during-a St. Louis-interview Scheguled
Ale Monday.

£-| But instead of a being given a private F

a4 terview, Times reporter Anthony J.

farro found himself walking into a hotel

prom full of news cameras and report- _

ers. Marro pushed his way out of the
thom, saying’ that he was being used.
iLane followed Marro out into the ‘hall,

+ Shouting, “Don't you want to print the

ruth?” ;

. _ Lane believed that the incident! sup. :

ported his contention that “the staff of
the House committee panicked when
they learned that I was aware of what
was going on. So they decidéd to set up a
secret meeting with The New York }
‘Times and discredit me.” H
Patterson said he knew nothing of
recent reports by Russell E. Byers of
Rock Hill that Byers had been offered

+ money by two Imperial, Mo., men to ,

arrange King’s killing. eo
Marro, whose newspaper brokti' By-
er? allegations, reported that Patt2rson
“hild never been reached by the Times
anc had never provided the paper-'with
any! information concerning the King
assassination prior to Monday.”"

in a brief telephone interview, Marro
added, “We chase a lot of-leads. Some
are good — some aren't. I'm going to
Washington to chase a few more.” .

Lane said he was disturbed with his
findings. An assassination buff who has .
written two books — “Rush to Judg-
mint” and “Code Name Zorro” — about:
the murders of King and President John
F. Kennedy, Lane contended that “it
seems impossible for anybody to now
take the House Select Committee: on
Assassinations seriously.” 1

Patterson, a self-proclaimed gypsy
salesman who says he has sold every-
thing from real estate to geraniums,
says he now has other matters to worry
about. Peart
Because he fears for his life, he said,
he was to leave the St. Louis area Mon-
day night. “I don’t know where I'll go,”
he said. “But when it comes to knuckles,
I think mine are going to get slapped.”

Ina related development, FBI direc-

tor William H. Webster said Monday
that the 1974 FBI report containing an
informant’s staterhent about a payoff
mide to Ray after King’s killing was
never turned over to federal investiga-
tos because of “simple inadvertance.”*
¢This document came to light lait
March, along with an earlier documert,
which was an FBI report that Byers had
told two lawyers that he had tured
down a-$50,000-offer-to arrange-King’s
* death. The FBI here had been checking
into Byers after he had become a prime ,
suspect in the two break-ins at the St.
Louis Art Museum, Charges against
Byers were,subsequently dropped.

The second document quoted an in-
former as saying he was told by Byers
that a Missouri businessman was “the
individual who made the payoff to
James Earl Ray after the killing” on
April 4, 1968.

Webster said that the second docu-
ment constituted “‘heresay three times
removed.” In New York to address the
American Bar Association's national
convention, Webster said that although
an investigation by his office concluded
that the report’s misplacement was a
mistake, it was not overly significant

*bikause “it has not yet been verified
tifat the informant spoke the truth.”

Although the document, as censored

yhen it was made public, did not specily
who Byers said had paid off Ray. Tue
report contained the first allegation that
money was actually paid to Ray.

Broker named
as conspirator
in FBI memo

WASHINGTON (AP) — An FBI-agent. was given a
second-hand account by an’ informant several years |
after the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther. King
Ir.thiat a St. Louis stockbroker was “the individual who
smade the payoff of James Earl Ray,” according to the
agent’s report released Thursday.

8 The stockbroker and a lawyer who also was impli- {
<cated in the claimed conspiracy haye died. Their wives ;,
deny their husbands had any such involvement.

«THE FBI AGENT, whose name has.not been re-
leased, wrote a memo for his own‘files in March, 1974,
‘after a wide-rariging interview with an unnamed infor- |
mant. Among the criminal matters they discussed was |
} the iniformant’s claim that he had been told the previous
I year by Russell G. Byérs, a former St. Louis auto parts

dealer, of 4 conspiracy by the lawyer and the stockbro-
| ker to murder King.
y

According to the informant, Byers ie originally
| was offéred $10,000 to $20,000 bythe ‘subse. !

i

Auently identified as John Sutherland, to kill King him-
‘self, but that Byers declined. *

! ‘ Byers ‘said-another man, subsequently name
gfockbroker John H. Kauffrnann; was present when the

for the actua)'killi

) Ray's serving a 99-year sentence for King’s killing, |
i He pleaded guilty,-but now says'he had no‘part inthe

The agent did not forward his report of the interview

| to FBI headquarters dnd it was riot discovered untillast* ;

Top FBI officials say that on learning of the episode, {
"they immediately forwarded the document to the Jus-
| tice-Department’ andthe Housé Seléct Committee on |

Assassinations, The Committee called Byers to testify
in closed session,

Some elements of the story were publicized Jast
week, when Byers. himself disclosed he had told the
committee he was offered $50,000, rather: than the less-
er ‘figure mentioned in the FBI ‘report, to kill Kirig.”

But in an-interview with The New York Times, By-
ers said nothing about 4 Kauffmann payoff to Ray, dnd
there has been no indication from official soutces that;

[Report on King

killing called —
only hearsay

NEW YORK (AP):—.A 1974 FBI report alleging a
iracy in the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther

ing Jr. was filed'away for four years instead of being
tirned over to federal in tors because of ‘‘simple

inadvertence,'’ FBI-Director William ‘HH. Webster said

Monday. i : E

However, Webster downplayed the significance
the slip-up, saying the report contained “hearsay:
times: removed” and that it was written long after
original investigation was concluded. =~

Th# recently released document quotes an informer

as saying he was told a Missouri businessman was “the
individual who made the payoff to James Earl Ray
after the killing.” Ray is serving a 9%year term in
Tennessee for the 1968 murder of the civil rights leader.

‘The report “‘would normally have been filed with the
King investigative file. This was not done,” Webster
saidinaninterview. -

“Tt hasn't been verified that the informant spoke the ||

truth. It hasn’t been verified” that the informant was
told the truth, Webster said.

Webster said he first learned of the FBI report last
March ahd that it was turned over to the House Assassi-
nations Committee at.that time, He said.his office ¢on-

inisplacernent was a matter of ‘‘simple inadvertence.”
He declined to characterize the status of the King
tigation or comment when asked whether the re-
’s existence represented a break in the investiga-

Attention is directed to two FD-302s in this file,

reflecting interviews conducted on 7/28/78 and 8/4/78,
respectively, by me, of former SA HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

pane Particular attention is directed to the interview with
KENNEDY on 8/4/78 as it pertains to dissemination of
information by him, which information is reflected in
serial 5 of St. Louis. file 137-16185. In this interview
of 8/4/78, KENNEDY stated that he recalls with reasonable
certainty that certain information was disseminated by him
to the St. Louis Police Department.

In order to document such dissemination, this is to
record that I personally searched our dissemination control
file, 66-2340, for the months of April through July of 1974
and found no record of such dissemination having been made.

It should be noted that the volume of 66-2340 for the
month of March, 1974, and prior months are no longer maintained
as they have been destroyed under the file destruction program.

There is no FD-159 (dissemination form) concerning this
matter contained in 137-16185 or the related file 87-21859.

service on February 28, 1977. Prior to his retirement he
was assigned to the St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954
to the date of his retirement. During 1974 he was assigned
to general criminal matters and worked as a Special Agent
under the supervision of Field Supervisor ROBERT L. BENDER.

Mr. KENNEDY's recollection was refreshed regarding an
interview with him at the FBI Office in St. Louis, Missouri,
on July 28, 1978, by SAC ROY B. KLAGER, JR., concerning a
closed St. Louis file 137-16185; more specifically, serial 5
of that file. Mr. KENNEDY recalled having read this serial
in detail. He further recalled earlier discussion on July 28,
1978, concerning a notation appearing on the above serial
which states, "Notify locals of info re killing", and his
earlier reply that in hiS recollection this cémment pertained
to a matter appearing on page 2 of the memorandum and unrelated
to the MARTIN LUTHER KING information.

Mr. KENNEDY was asked if he did in fact disseminate the
information in keeping with the above-cited handwritten
notation. He related that he recalls with reasonable certainty
that he did disseminate thé information appearing on page 2
to someone:in the St. Louis Police Departiment whose identity
he does not now recall.

Mr. KENNEDY called further attention to the last paragraph
of page 3 of the memorandum in question which refers to another
killing, unrelated to the MARTIN LUTHER KING matter. He
volunteered that this additional unrelated information was also
disseminated, to the best of his recollection, to the St. Louis
Police Department; however, he similarly does not recall to
whom this information was given.

Byers Knew Of Payoff,
FBI Was Told |

. WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau

' wf Investigation received information in
1973 that Russell G. Byers, a former auto
larts dealer and police character from
Rock Hill, knew who “made the payoff of

» ames Earl Ray” after the assassination
uf the Rey. Dr, Martin Luther King Jr.

Byers’ accusation, reported by an
-nformant, is contained in an internal St.
Louis FBI office memorandum made
«available Wednesday to the Post-Dis-
patch under the Freedom of Information
Act.

The memorandum, which went un-
noticed for four years in the wrong file in
‘St. Louis, does not give the name of the
man identified by Byers. But it describes
the man as “a short, stocky man who

walked with a limp.”

This description, several sources have
told the Post-Dispatch, fits John R.
Kauffmann, a one-time stockbroker of
Imperial, Mo. Byers has reportedly told
investigators for the House Assassina-
tions Committee that Kauffmann and
John H. Sutherland, both now dead,
asked Byers to arrange King’s murder.

However, one source said that at least
one other man fitting the description
could not be ruled out as the person
described in the memorandum. The
second man was described by St. Louis
police sources as an avowed segregation-
ist and an acquaintance of Sutherland’s.

Byers refused to comment on the FBI
memo when reached at his Rock Hill

home Wednesday night. He said the
House committee had asked him not to
make public statements.

Byers was keenly interested, however,
in the new disclosures. He carefully
analyzed the copy of the FBI memo
released Wedr.zsday. And, while hum-
ming a tune, he read through a New
‘York Times story about the memo.

Byers’ allegations are currently under
scrutiny by the House Committee on
Assassinations. A committee source told
the Post-Dispatch Wednesday night that
the committee was still trying to assess
the significance of Byers’ story.

All names but that of Byers were
deleted from the FBI memorandum by
rgedorn of Information Privacy

Acts Branch. But the memorandum

discussed a meeting among Byers and

two men in which Byers said he “had 1A st. LOUIS

been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to oo POST-DISPATCH
ing.” 7 7 7

Sources have told the Post-Dispatch
that Byers told House investigators that
Kauffmann and Sutherland, a patent vaueesl
lawyer, also from Imperial, asked him to
arrange King’s murder.

The memorandum, dated March 19,
1974, was written by a St. Louis agent of
the FBI on the basis of information
supplied by an informant.

“In the fall of 1973,” the memorandum
reads, “Beyers)(the name is consistently
misspelled in the memo) talked freely

about himself and his business, and they
Jater went to (short deletion by FBI)

where Beyers told a story about visiting +
a lawyer in St. Louis County, now
deceased, not further identified, who had
offered to give him a contract to kill

Martin Luther King. He said that also
Present was a short, stock man, who
walked with a limp.”

Mr. ROBERT L. BENDER resides at Route 1, Box 388, Chestérfield,
Missouri 63017, residence telephone number (314) (391-6518.

. Mr. BENDER is presently unemployed, having retired from FBI
service on 2/28/77. Prior to his retirement he was assigned to
the St. Louis Field Division of the FBI from 1953 to the date of
his retirement. Additionally, he served in the capacity of
Field Supervisor in the St. Louis Division o£ the FBI for approx-
imately nine years prior to and until the date of his retirement.
He supervised general criminal matters.

Mx. BENDER was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office, at
which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. BENDER was exhibited sufficient portions of a closed
St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to identify it as a matter
which was at one time under his supervision and assigned to an
Agent under his supervision by the name of HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

The file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. O'HARA,
a former informant of the St. Louis Division of the FBI.

The attention of Mr. BENDER was directed to a memorandum in
this file dated 3/19/74 to the SAC, St. Louis, from Special Agent
HOWARD C. KENNEDY. This memorandum is identified as setial 5 of
the file. Mx. BENDER was ‘permitted to read this memorandum in
order to refresh his memory concerning its contents. Although
he had no independent recollection of the memorandum or its contents,
after reading it he concluded that the memorandum had crossed his
desk on or about 3/19/74, as attested to by the appearance of his
handwriting on the memorandum. BENDER's attention was further
directed to paragraph 2, page 3 of the memorandum, which paragraph
begins, "During the fall of 1973...," and ending with "... $20,000
to kill KING."

Mr. BENDER related that he had no independent recollection of
the paragraph in question; however, upon reviewing the éntire
memorandum dated 3/19/74, he found no evidence that the information
contained in the above-cited paragraph was either acted upon or

disseminated beyond the file in which the memorandum is located.
He did note that there is a handwritten notation in his hand-
writing on page 1 of the memorandum which states, "Notify locals

of info re killing." Upon reading the memorandum in detail,

it was BENDER's conclusion that this handwritten notation did
not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied to
an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities appearing
on page 2 of the memorandum.

Mr. BENDER stated that he has absolutely no recollection
as to why the information contained in the above-cited paragraph
on page 3 of the memorandum in question was not disseminated
or acted upon. He can only assume that such failure was through
inadvertence. He can make no judgment whatsoever concerning
the credibility of the information as a possible reason for
not acting on it. BENDER related, however, that because of
his long association with the FBI in St. Louis, he does recall
an individual by the name of RUSSELL BYERS as a well-known
thief and fence.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. BENDER stated that in
retrospect and in light of today's climate, the information
concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING in the memorandum of 3/19/74
should have been acted upon.

Mr. HOWARD C. KENNEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drive,
Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residence telephone number (314)
521-8221.

Mr. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private
investigator and polygraph examiner. He retired from FBI service
on 2/28/77. Prior to his retirement he was assigned to the
St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954 to the date of his
retirement.. During 1974 he was assigned to general criminal _
matters and worked as a Special Agent under the supervision of
Field Supervisor ROBERT L. BENDER:

Mr. KENNEDY was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office,
at which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. KENNEDY was exhibited sufficient portions of a Glosed
St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to idéntify it as a matter
which was at one time assigned to him while hé was an FBI Agent.

the file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. OHARA,
a former informant. ‘of the St. Louis Division of the FBI. The
attention of Mr. KENNEDY was directed to a inemorandum. in this
file dated 3/19/74 from him to the Sac, St. Louis. This memorandum
is identified as serial 5 of the file. He ‘was permitted to. read
this memorandum in order to refresh his memory concerning its
contents. KENNEDY related that from his review of this memorandum
it reflects the results of a contact by hin with O4HARA at which
time O'HARA furnished him several pieces 6f imformation. .
KENNEDY's attention was further directed to paragraph 2, page 3
of the iiemorandum, which paragraph béegins,"During the fall of
1973.'...," and ending with "... $20;000 to kill KING."

Mx. KENNEDY stated that upon having his memory réfreshed
by reading the abové memorandum, he vaguely recalls receiving
the information. He has no recollection, however, of having
disseminated the information contained in. the above-cited ~
paragraph or that thé information was otherwisé acted upon.
He can Gite no reason for such failuve other than inadvertence.

in the memorandum, and he shared this information with no
other personnel in the office.

Mr. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the
information and he is sure that no other information concerning
KING was furnished to him by O'HARA. He can make no comment
with regard to the credibility of the information at this late
date. . He does not believe, however, that credibility of either
O'HARA or BYERS entered into any decision or lack of decision
with regard to dissemination of the information concerning KING.

KENNEDY recalls, however, from his many years of service
in the FBI at St. Louis that RUSSELL BYERS was a well-known
fence.

KENNEDY reiterated that he has no idea or reason for the
failure to disseminate the information contained in paragraph
2 of page 3 of the cited memorandum as it relates to MARTIN
LUTHER KING. He noted that there is nothing written on the
memorandum to indicate such dissemination was made or action
taken otherwise.

Mr. KENNEDY's attention was further directed to a hand-
written notation on the first page of the memorandum which
states, "Notify locals of info re killing." He identifies
this notation as being in the handwriting of his former Supervisor,
ROBERT L. BENDER. Upon reading the memorandum in detail, it
was KENNEDY's conclusion that this handwritten notation did
not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied
to an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities
appearing on page 2 of the memorandum.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. KENNEDY stated that

in retrospect, the information Concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING

to kill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King

that Byers was out of town and was.nct

A reputable St. Louisan confirms that
Russell G. Byers told him that he had y
been offered $50,000 by two Imperial,
Mo., men to arrange the death of the

|. Rev. Dr, Martin Luther King.

Byers twice mentioned the plot, first in
generalities shortly after the assassina-
tion in 1968 and later in more detail in
about 1974, the St. Louisan told the Post-
Dispatch. He said that in the Jatter
conversation Byers told of a stockbroker j
taking him to the Imperial farm of a

patent lawyer to discuss the plot.
£ Byers did not use names, the promi-
Ei citizen said, but he apparently tas

‘eférring to stockbroker John R. Kayff-
ann and lawyer John H. Sutherland,

| whom he has accused of the plot ii

recent testimony to the House Assassin:

tions Committee.

‘4 Previous accounts of the alleged assas! ;
sination plot have said that Byers hag

* said that he told two lawyers and other *
unidentified persons about it some years ¢
ago. But this is the first direct confirma- {

' tion from one of those persons.

In another development, a Clayten
lawyer, who has been questioned by the .‘
House Assassinations Committee staff,
told a reporter he had seen Byers and
Kauffmann meeting several times in the
late 1960s. The lawyer represented both
Kauffmann and Byers on separate legal

atters, ue

Byers was paiticulariy close to Kauff-

Asked whether Byers had told him
about the alleged assassination offer, the
lawyer said he could not respcnd be-

apparently because he feared repr
fom Byers or other.

The House Assassinations Committee
is conducting an intensive investigation
into Byers’ allegations. {t held closed
hearings on them last week. Byers was -
reported to have told the committee that
he turned down the offer from Suther-
Jand and Kauffmann, which he says was
made in late 1956 or early 1967. Suther-
land died in 1970, and Kauffman died in
1973.

The St. Louisan said that Byers told
him shortly after the King assassination
in 1963 that he might know somethin;
Pbout it, and that the Ku Klux Klaa of,
'some organization was behind it. q

“That's all he said. I thought it was
just street talk,” the St. Louisan said.
Later, in about 1974, Byers mentioned
the plot again. The St. Louisan gave this
account of what he said: A stockbroker -
who had lost his license, apparently
Kauffmann, approached-Byers with the
$50,000 offer. Byers asked him whom he
had to kill. Kauffnsann took Byers to a
St. Louis patent attorney who lived on 2
nearby farm in Imperial who said King
as the target, Byers said he never had
fntendéd to follow through on the plot but
had gone along out of curiosity. y
sutherland, the patent lawyer owned a
farm in Imperial near Kauffmann’s*
Irhperial home, Sutherland was a segre-

gationist and the organizer of the Cili-
zens Council in St. Louis, a states rights
giup formed in 1964 that pase

ayiti-black literature.
The St. Louisan said his recollection of
+ the conversation with Byers differed in
one way from the recently published
accounts of Byers’ testimony to the
House committee. .
“From what | read, Byers seems to be
saying now that he thinks Ray (James

- Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty to the King °

assiissination) is a fall guy. But that's
notthe impression I got then. 1 thougat
Russell thought they probably ap-
proiched Ray through some friend/of
Kaufimann, a doctor who worked at the
prison”. fe soho

Br. Hugh W. Maxey, the former chief. °
sician at the Missouri State Peniten-

was a friend of Kauffmann,

‘he St. Louisan said Byers had not

mentioned his brother-in-law, John Paul

. Spica, who was serving a murder sen.>
tence in the Penitentiary at the time Ray
escaped from the institution. Byers too,
in his receht statements reportedly told
the House committee that Spica was not
involved. But press accounts have specu-
Jated whether he could have transmitted
word of the $50,000 offer to Ray.

'. The St, Louisan said he believed Byers
in 1874, “I mean you do believe someon?
if You don’t have, any reason to thinit

they lied,” he said. But in the.wake

Byers’ arrest in connection with thefts of

.\ Byers might then have been in trouble
'{{0o and put out the assassination story tot
get the Federal Bureau of Investigation’
the police to ease off him. Byers was!
not prosecuted for the museum thefts.

The St. Louisan refused to say whether
bi House committee has questioned
Him.

* The Clayton lawyer knew Kauffmann
quite well in the late 1950s and early,
1960s when Kauffmann was a stockbrok-
er in Clayton and a client. Kauffmann
jalso entertained the lawyer at his Jeffer-
jjson County home.

| The lawyer said tht Kauffmann, long :

Yactive on the periphery of Democratic

“politics in St. Louis and Jefferson coun-

ties, had been involved in the presiden-
tial campaign of Alabama Gov, George
C. Wallace in 1968. Sutherland also was a
leader of the Wallace campaign here,

The lawyer said he thought only money
or the promise of it would have
motivated Kauffmann to get involved ity
Wallace’s campaign or the King plot;
avohn was not a racist,” hé said. i}

“He was growing old and a inttigy
spared, maybe, and he wanted money,’
thé lawyer said, He said the same fears
diay have led to Kauffmann’s federal

onviction in 1967 for iegally selling -

500,000 amphetamine pills. In the 1940s,
by kontrast, Kauffmann had been {in
airgraft executive, stock broker afid
member of the St. Louis Stock Hx-
charige, But when he died his estate was
worth only $10,000. .

Kauffmann made his living in the 1960s |

by selling so-called ‘penny stocks,” the
lawyer recalled. For example, Kauft-
mann would start a company with
capital of about one-cent per share and
‘then sell stock for $1 per share,

There was nothing illega} about that
when Kauffmann was involved, the law-
yer said, but changes in the securities
laws in later years put an end to penny
stocks and to Kaufiman’s main source of
income, + Beans

The lawyer said he always found Byers
tobe truthful and could see no advantage
to Byers in telling about the alleged plot.
‘The lawyer said he thought the plot was
plausible. He represented Byers in a.
civil case about five years ago.

So far, there has been no corroboration
of Byers’ allegation or any credible link
to Ray. The wives of both Sutherland and

that had been priced at about $50, but purchased for $15
in the St. Charles area. We offered to pay $15 for the
item, exhibiting considerable interest in and knowledge
of antiques, He left the store without buying anything,
- but within a day or two returned to the store, also meeting
informant, and still having interest in the piece he had
previously looked at, This was the first meeting with in-
formant. This individual brought with him a small pottery
tea set, described as golden brown, with a set of cups and
saucers, pitcher, sugar, and creamer, having a gold~-brown
shiny glaze. The set was believed to be worth about $100,
but he offered to sell it Lor $300. He then identified hin-
self as RUSSELL BEYERS. He is belived to be a very intelli-
gent, percerfive person. No business was transacted.- On
that occeagfon, however, BEYERS “opened up" with informant,
that he is personally represented by Attorney MURRAY...
RANDSEL (Porner attorney, USDJ, and former AUSA, EDHO), and
tig he and RANDALL ave very close personal friends, He said
had inquired of an individual at OK Novelty Co., St. Louis,

informant, He said he had learned that he could talk te
informant, advising further that it was his understanding
that informant was not a "snitch", He also advised that he
had personally sent the aforementioned biack couple into
informant's shop to “have him knocked off", but that after
learning that he could be trusted, he had advised the black
couple against taking anything from him, He asserted that
32 there was anything in.St. Louls that informant wanted to
buy, he vould have it stolen and sell it to him at the right
price, He cane into infarmant!s shop at least once er twice _
Zor the next several wekks , and shortly after the aforemen-
‘tioned second meeting in the shop, BEYERS told informant that
he had a painting recently stolen, referring td it as the
- “Norman Rockwell", He said he intended "to have it on ice",
but would sell it to informant for $5,000. tnxormaut advised
he personally contacted his lawyer, inquiring as to whether
it would be feasible to buy the painting and sell it to an
Ainsurane company. Reportedly, this lawyer, not identified
by informant, made some inquiries and found that the involved

the painting was "going into cold storage", BEYERS has
never again mentioned this painting,

: date not recalled, BEYERS came to the shop inquiring as to

' whether they could get together to talk, and they later did
so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo., in the area of a Br

- Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on business,

BEYERS talked freely about himself and his business, and
they later went to informant's house where BEYERS told a story
about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis County, now deceased,
not further identizied, who nad offered to give him a contract
to kill MARTIN LUTHER KING, He said that also present was a
short, stocky man, whe walked with a limp. (Later, with a~

dutter individual, BEYERS commented that this

Patter the kiliing,) BEYERS said he had declined ‘to.
this contract, He did remark thatthis lawyer had
Confederate flags and other items ahout the house that might
indicate that he was "a real rebel", BEYERS also commented
that he had be offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill

Sometime later, informant talked to JOSEPH, "JOO"
O, & known fence, with whom he is acquitinted.” This™
duat advised informant that BEYERS truly is a "very
tregicherous guy", cautioning him to stay away from him &f
he wanted to stay out of treuble.

About two or three months ago, BEYERS telephoned
him at 7:00 on night, probably a Monday night, date not re-
ql calied, advising that he was going ta@ kili 8, Novth st. Louis

BEYERS could have said that the man had "snitched ‘of drugs",

At sbo hat same time, informant recalied that
BEYERS inquived/is to whether he knew anyone by the name
of EUGENE ZIGZER who lives somewhere in West St. Louis
County. LZERS referred to him as an old man, believed
by him to‘tave stolen some paintings in Florida, BEYERS
gaid he intended to find out whether the man had the painte
dngs and if so, he intended to have them stolen from hin,

About one month prior te the date of the reported
burglary of the Jefferson Memorial, St. Louis, in which seve
eral items of Lindbergh trophies were taken, exact date not
recalled, BEYERS came to his shop asking him if he was in-
terested in buying any articles fram the Jefferson Memorial,
commenting specifically that he had in mind some “commemorae
tive pieces" that were included in the Lindbergh trophies,
Informant said he told him this would be ‘too hot to handle*
whereupon BEYERS said they could be used to "set up enemies"
hy “stashing them in the trunk of somebody's car", xnformant
said he told BEYERS he was not interested in that kind of
Job since he had been in trouble once (robbery of Four Seasons
Antique Shop) and did not care to get in that kind of trouble
again, Within several days, informant heard the news of the
breakin of the Jefferson Memorial and the theft of several
items there, A day or two after that publicity, BEYERS came
to informant's shop, advising that "now Xy*ve got my hands.

it appeared BEYERS had not shaven for several days, Ordi«
narily, BEYERS is a very conservatiie, well-dressed person.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Former Special Agent Harold R. Dobson (1941 - 1972),
residence: 8831 Bracken Circle, St. Louis, Missouri 63123,
who was St. Louis case Agent on the M. L. King - James Earl Ray
case in 1968, was interviewed, not under oath, by Mr. Michael
Eberharét, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, at the offices of that committee,
Room 3386, Second and "D" Streets, Southwest, Washington, D. C.,
from 2:00 P.M. to 2:45 P.M. on the afternoon of June 28, 1978,
at which time he furnished the following information in response
to direct questions: -

Dobson served as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation from October 20, 1941 to retirement on June 30;
1972, being assigned to the Boston, Newark, St. Paul, and St.
Louis Divisions. He was in St. Louis from 1947 until retirement.
He was assigned to the Security Squad from 1948 to retirement,
concerned primarily with investigation of the Communist Party and
its members, nationalistic tendency, espionage, sabotage, and
Security of Government Employee cases. He had comparatively
little knowledge or experience regarding New Left, racial and hate
group cases. He was an alternate supervisor but declined
authorization as supervisor for personal reasons.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of the
Cointel Program in St. Louis, but was unable to recall any
specific activities, objectives, or accomplishments of same.

Dobson was unable to suggest why the case was assigned
to him, except that he had the first St. Louis lead in the case,
to trace the weapon used through officials of Browning Arms
Company, with whom he had continuing liaison, and for the further
reason he had been utilized in an administrative capacity on

virtually every major case of national importance in the St.
Louis Division beginning with the surveillance and apprehension
of St. Louis Communist Party leaders in 1952. Another Special
Agent since retired handled the Ray penitentiary escape~case
‘prior to the assassination. 7 ear 3

Special Agent in Charge Thomas Gearty supervised the
King case in St. Louis. It was Dobson's responsibility to
coordinate the investigation, handle the resulting "mountain of
paper", see that obvious, logical, reasonable, or merely
desirable leads or avenues of investigation were appropriately
assigned (with Special Agent in Charge approval), promptly and
adequately covered, and properly reported, and to keep the
Special Agent in Charge, Bureau, Memphis, and other interested
offices promptly advised of pertinent developments.

Until the true identity of Ray was established, every
Special Agent in the St. Louis Division was assigned exclusively
to the case. Twenty-four hour coverage of ail leads was
mandatory. Developments of the day were discussed, and "brain
busting" sessions were held at nightly conferences of all
Special Agents, at which most new assignments were made. All
employees clearly gave of their best efforts.

Dobson was unable to recall specifically what efforts
were made to determine the whereabouts of John. Ray on the day
of the assassination. He suggested the file would be the best
evidence “in this regard. He believed the possibility of John
Ray's involvement was undoubtedly recognized and that ea fant
steps were taken to resolve.

Dobson was unable to recall any surreptitious entries
to Ray's relatives' premises. St. Louis had no technical
surveillances on relatives. Requests for authorization for
same may have been made, but if so, were without his knowledge.

To the extent of his knowledge, the St. Louis Division
had never placed a technical surveillance on King.

Toll call records of relatives were obtained in
accordance with a then current Bureau poiicy subpoena process.
Relative bank accounts were monitored and results set forth in
reports with a statement that the information would only be
available after issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. Coverage of
relatives consisted of this, plus personal interviews and contacts

with informants, sources, neighbors, and associates, and
available public records.

Relatives were initially uncooperative in varying
degrees, but subsequently became generally cooperative,
although Dobson never fully trusted any of them. He was unable
to recall any evidence developed that Ray was ever in St. Louis
territory, or in contact with any relatives there, subsequent to
his penitentiary escape. He doubted financial contributions to
Ray by them, as their combined incomes and assets, in his
estimation, were insufficient to support the life style Ray
apparently enjoyed following his escape.

Dobson had no ‘knowledge or any information as to the
source of Ray's income following his escape. He conjectured
the same would have logically had to result from successful
eriminal activity or be contributed by an unknown person or
group. He recognized Ray's record stamped him as a "loser",
but opined it was not beyond the realm of possibility access
to an excellent prison library and association with convicts
less unsuccessful than himself could have enhanced the quality
of Ray's thought processes to a point where he could. have
conceived and carried out a successful supermarket or other
similar robbery. At least his escape was succéssful. He
considered Ray's technically proper preparation and filing of a
motion for a new trial, which was pending at the time of his
escape, as evidence of this possibility. Dobson recalled that,
as a Missouri prosecutor prior t6 entering the Bureau, he had
uniformly recommended alternative punishment for non-habitual
criminals, as the Missouri Penitentiary, even then, was generally
considered a "finishing school for criminals". Supermarkets
offered the possibility of being almost as lucrative as banks,
without the disadvantage of incurring Federal jurisdiction. He
feels sure major police departments in the St. Louis territory
had been contacted to determine if Ray could be a logical
suspect in unsolved supermarket robberies. He recalled some
indication Ray might have been involved ina bank robbery in
Alton, Illinois and that the Springfield, Illinois Division had
been so advised, but he had no knowledge as to the outcome of
investigation there.

Dobson was ‘generally aware of the existence of white
hate organizations, but was of the opinion members of such
organizations in St. Louis territory lack sufficient organization,

NW 595215 DooId:32989797_ Page 134



NW 55215

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

intelligence, and financial capability for significant
involvement in the King killing. Such organizations, in his
estimation, should have been able to reasonably foresee,
King's death would elevate him to the status of a martyx,
which would have been counterproductive to their aims and
purposes. He was of the further opinion that any intelligent”
co-conspirator would undoubtedly have eliminate Ray as a
security measure. He suggested that, if then current rumors
that King had become a liability to the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference were true, that organization had the most
to gain from King's demise. 7

“All St. Louis informants, potential informants and
sources regarding criminal, security, racial, hate group, or
other matters, were under continuing instructions to immediately
report even the slightest information which they could obtain
or which might come to their attention regarding the King case.

Dobson recalled John Gawron as an elderly, self-
confessed habitual criminal, who had lived with Ray's mother
several years until her death. He never met, saw, 'or talked to
Gawron. If Gawron was initially carried as a PCI, but later
appeared openly, Dobson was unable to recall why, but suggested
Gawron may have initially indicated some potential for
furnishing information regarding current criminal matters and
was later found incapable of doing so. Having lived with Ray's
mother, Gawron was undoubtedly able to furnish some factual
personal history and background information as to the family
in the past, but it was Dobson's impression that Gawron was not
fully trusted by them and was capable of furnishing only
conjectural information as to their then current activities.
According to Agents handling Gawron, he would start with a half-
truth or conjecture, and embroider upon it, and therefore was
considered generally to be unreliabie.

St. Louis Agents contacting released fellow inmates
were instructed to not only obtain all possible information as
to Ray's whereabouts, but all possible information as to their
Gegree of association with him, his sentiments, his plans, the
identities of any associates or friends either in or out of
prison, and the manner of his escape.

Doeld:32989797 Page 135

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS . t

Dobson was unable to recall any telephonic contacts
with the Memphis case agent, although there may have beén one
ox two. He was in frequent telephonic contact with the
Chicago Assistant Special Agent in Charge, who was handling
‘the case there, as Jerry Ray made at least one trip to visit
St. Louis relatives.

Dobson never met, saw, or spoke with any Ray relatives,
with the exception of Jerry Ray who contacted him telephonically.
on two or three occasions during a visit to St. Louis pursuant
to instructions from the Chicago Division.

‘Dobson had no idea as to the basis for any friction
which may have existed between Director Hoover and King. Mr.
Hoover never confided in Dobson and never sought his advice.

cal 8/30/68

. On August 23, 1968, Mr. HARVEY A. KLINGEMAN and Mrs.
CLARA S. KLINGEMAN,owners, Indian Trail Restaurant, 507
Chestnut Street, Winnetka, Illinois, phone HI 6-1703,
residence 391 Linden, Winnetka, Illinois, phone HI 6-2932,

., were interviewed jointly in the conference room at the Winnetka,
Illinois, Police Department, after being introduced to the
interviewing Agents by Chief DON DERWING (NA), Winnetka,
Illinois, Police Department. :

They advised that on Tuesday, August 20, 1968, they
were contacted by WILLIAM BRADFORD HULE, Hartselle, Aabama,
who is the author of "Three Lives For Mississippi". Mr. HUIE
was accompanied by Mr. (First Name Unknown. ) HANSEN, who is
a photographer for "Look"! magazine. Mr. HUIE exhibited
letters which he claimed were from JAMES EARL RAY and were
addressed to a Mississippi attorney. These letters were
purportedly given to HUIE by the attorney. HULE told them
that he had obtained all commercial rights to RAY's story
and for this he has agreed to underwrite the costs of RAY's
defense in the forthcoming murder trial in Memphis, Tennessee.
The aforementioned letters were writted on half sheets of
yellow legal foolscap and both of the KLINGEMANs stated that
they recognized the handwriting on these papers as that of the
subject RAY, whom they knew under the name of JOHN RAYNS. At
this point, the KLINGEMANs were exhibited several photographs
of the subject, JAMES EARL RAY, along with other photographs
and they both positively identified JAMES EARL RAY as a man
employed by them from May 3, 1967; to June 24,1967, as a
dishwasher and cook's helper. The KLINGEMANs verified the
foregoing statement by furnishing to the interviewing Agents
their payroll ledger sheet. A review of the ledger sheet
reveals the foliowing information:

In addition, the KLINGEMANs also made available the

They also made available the following listed

These checks. are as follows: 7

The foregoing checks. total $664.34.

Mr. KLINGEMAN advised that to the best of his
recollection at this time, the last check, Number 5357, was
mailed to RAY's brother, name urirecalled, in Northbrook,
Illinois, at RAY's request since ‘he left his’ employment
prior to recéipt of the check, stating that he was going to
work on boats with his brother. As Mr, KLINGEMAN recalls,
he’ received a letter from RAY requesting that the pay due be
sent to his brother.

| NW 5. DocId:32989797 Page 158



CG 44-1114

Both. of the KLINGEMANs characterized JAMES EARL
RAY as an excellent employee, quiet, attentive, prompt,
polite, a very good worker, but to their knowledge,
had no friends or visitors during the time of his
employment. They did recall that during the subject's
last week of employment, he received three or four phone 7
calls from a male individual who stted that he was RAY's brother.
‘They could not recall the individual's name,nor did they
believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they
heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANs
received the following information on a confidential basis. and
advised that they were rather reluctant to divulge it,
but felt that it was their duty as citizens. They requested
that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within
the FBI. They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING
because of his reputation and are now following his advice in
furnishing this information to the FBI: :

Mr. HUIE dpwed the KLINGEMANs letters from RAY in
which RAY listed employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.
(It should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,
upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation. Chief
DERNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an
excellent reputation within the community and that he holds
them in very high regard). HUIE told them that RAY had
served seven years of a twenty-year sentence at Jefferson,
Missouri, prison, during which time he had eight visitors,
one of whom was his brother, however, HUIE did not identify
which one. Prior to his escape, RAY had stashed away
a razor, green prison trousers which had been dyed black, and
12 hersey bars in anticipation that. he would have to go
without food for,some time. RAY also had $300 in his shoe.
He escaped in atr@i truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,
from Jefferson City, Missouri, which took him about eight
days. ‘(The KLINGEMANs do recall that when the subject first
appered at the restaurant, his feet were swollen and that
their sister-in-law gave him two Ace bandages to use which he
returried three or four days later. This supposedly was
mentioned in the letter in HUIE's possession). :

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the
Tribune wheein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the
restaurant. HUIE said that the subject in the letter

NW 55215 DoclId:32989797 Page 159



CG 44-1114

mentioned that the employment at. the Indian Trail Restaurant
was the “high point of his life''. \ :

HUIE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs
in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of
East St. Louis, Illincis, which ws prior to his going to
prison the last time. He also said that during the time RAY
was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder"
by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to
reveai his identity to the policé and cause RAY's return to
Prison if he, RAY, did not work for this person. HUIE said
that RAY was given $1,200 during the initial contacts,by.the
alleged conspirators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but
was due to receive more. :

7 Again, according to: HUIE, RAY was told to go to
Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.
Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into
Canada. He also made a third trip to Canada, date and
sequence not given, and "was instructed'to obtain a 40-year-
old newspaper, get the names of the males born that de,
and search the current phone directory for similar names.

He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to
determine whether or not his physical description was

similar to theirs. Thereafter,he telephoned persons of his
like description, utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a manr
who had never applied for a passport. RAY then applied for a
passport in this name.

The KLINGEHANs advised that they were not sure that
they were furnishing this information in its proper tec
sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the iced
information preceding and following was given to them in this
order by HUIN. Thereafter,RAY was given more money to PEEL
purchase a Mustang which was to-be driven to Acapulco, Mexico
for the purpose of obtaining a tourist sticker. He then.
drove through Mexico to the West Coast and. hid out there to
tveceive further instructions from the other individuals in
the alleged conspiracy. HUIE stted that RAY was flown to
Atlanta from the West Coast, but the time was not right, there
Was no action andbe was sent back to California. He was also ©
told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and place.
Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at ar Holiday
Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY was flown there.

MW 95215 “DecId:32989797 Page 160” a Sete ee : F



CG 44-1114

Subsequently, RAY was given money to obtain binoculars
and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at
3 p.m. in room 312 or3. Supposedly there were other
individuals who also came to this room and there was 2
Negro male who purportedly called KING out to the balcony.
According to HULE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,
although RAY was present and at a later time {probably the trial)
“RAY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran
“to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.
He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money", however, the
conspirators did not appear. RAY allegedly spent several days
or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia,awaiting the
arrival of his "fellow conspirators". :

According to HUIE, the plan was for RAY to go .to
Mexico, but immediately fly north to throw off pursuit and
to steer all investigation to Mexico. However, since
the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to. Cgrda
thereafter utilizing his knowledgé to obtain a passport and
fled to England. : :

; The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story
substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared
after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that
HUIE stated that RAY did rob a bank in London because he
“got real low on money". HUIE at no time identified the
alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear’ the KLINGEMANs
to secrecy and told them that he wovld mail the '"Look'!
proofs on September 10,1968, and the story would be in the -
November 10,1958, issue of Look magazine. Both Mr. and Mrs.
KLINGEMAN advised that they would make these proofs available to
te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGEMANs advised that RAY began working for
them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitute
was advanced to cook's helper. During the time he was in
their employ, they did not observe him in a car, nor did they
know him to own, an automobile. He had no visitors, he did
not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make
any advances toward the female personnel employed at the
restaurang and they noted that his hair was "less bushy" dutng
the time he was at the restaurant than shown in the :
photographs. :

They are not sure how he came to work from his
apartment, but believe henight have been:met at the Eden's
Expressway by WILLIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who were also
employees at the restaurant.

“*, the Negro race and specifically no comments whatsoever cori-

. when RAY received the phone calls during his last week of
- employment he seemed to be disturbed and that his
. concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was.

JAMES EARL RAY left England, he was going to Lisbon to get to

cerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. RAY madé no, referérice to his

They then recalled that according to HUIE, that when

Africa, howéver, he was unable. to do so wnich is when he returned
to England and held up a bank receiving about $200in loot.
They again stated that the information furnished to them by

-  HUIE came fromJetters which RAY had written to his attorney, who
‘in turn turned them over to the author. Also Mr. KLINGEMAN

stated that in one of the letters which he believed was to
the attorney from RAY, while he was in London, England, there

‘was a drawing identifying a location ‘which appeared to be

Diversey Street and Sheffield Avenue in Chicago, Iliinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Kl ihgemans
again requested that this information be maintained in
confidence and expressed a willingness to co-operate with

. the FBI in ay way possible.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS _(HSCA)

In the couse of a file review in an unrelated
matter, SL 3167-C, St. Louis File 137~-16185, Bureau File
137-36945, was reviewed. This file contained a contact
memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which contained information
relating to several criminal matters and also contained the
following paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,
date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as
to whether they could get together to talk, and they later
did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo., in the area of a
Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on
business. Beyers talked freely about himself and his
business, and they later went to informant's house where
Beyers told a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis:
County, now deceased, not further identified, who had
offered to give him a contract to kill Martin Luther King.
He said that also present was a short, stocky man, who
walked with a limp. (Later, with regard to the latter
individual, Beyers commented that this man was actually
the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Ray after
the killing.) Beyers said he had declined to accept this
contract. He did remark that this lawyer had confederate
flags and other items about the house that might indicate
that he was 'a real rebel’. Béyers also commented that
he had been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill King."

Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices
and files failed to reveal this information was if any way
disseminated and the information simply reposes in the informant
file.

ON NOVEMBER 21 AND 29, 1977, AND HIS
i TUSTINONY BEFORE THE SUB-COMMITTEE

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1977

At approximately 3:00 p.m., November 21, 1977,
+ Special Agent (SA) William R. Duncan was interviewed by
| Mrs. Sheila Lee and Mr. Michael Everhart, Attorneys for
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, at the U. S.
House of Representatives, Annex Number Two, Washington, D.C

SA Duncan was told his name came up as. having made an
offer in the Louisville Police Department to kill Dr. Martin
Luther King in 1965. Duncan told them he was assigned to the
Louisville Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
/from February, 1952, until May, 1967, and had responsibilities
as Liaison Agent with the Louisville Police Department during
| most of this period.

‘Phe allegation involved an incident which allegedly
took place at a roll-call time in the Pirst District Office
sonetime in the fall of 1965, Reportedly making the allega-
tion was Clifton Baird, white male, 50, a retired Louisville
police officer who retired in 1975 after 27 years of service.
Also present was Chief of Datectives, Major Robert Gregory, .
Captain Priest ti. Fry, formerly Chief of Detectives and possibly
the Captain of the First District; Lieutenant James Bibb, a
uniformed First District Lieutenant; Sergeant Brent Hardin, a
Third District Sergeant; possibly Herman Mitchell, Homicide
Squad; Licutenant Vernon Austin; and possibly Robert E. Peters
(SA), formerly of the Louisville Division of the FBI.

Duncan vas asked what he knew about the allegation md
he related that in late March or early April, 1977, he received
in the PBI mail an Associated Press clipping about a Clifton

an offer to kill Dr. Martin Luther King. The clipping came
in the regular FBI mail and Duncan stated he did not know who
sent it to him.

A few days later, while on the phone to ex-FBI Supervisor
Robert E. Peters in Louisville regarding a social engagement,
Dunean asked him about the clipping and who Clifton Baird was
and what the clipping referred to. Peters said Baird was a
tall, heavy-set man who was in the Vice Squad for a while and
that Duncan should have known him from seeing him in the Vice
Squad while Duncan worked with the Detective Bureau in Louis<

_ville.

Approximately April 25, 1977, FBI Headquarters sent a
wommunication to Louisville and St. Louis FBI Offices request-
ing the present locations of former Special Agent in Charge of
Lotiisville, Bernard c. Brown; Supervisor Robert BE, Peters;
and SA William R. Duncan as they were named by former Police
Officer Clifton Baird alleging seecacbecacteectonece in the Martin
Iuther King assassination case. : .

SA Duncan initially had no recollection of the incident
and he called former SA Peters at Louisville and asked him if
he knew anything about this. Peters replied that he had no
idea. Duncan later called retired Police Captain John Hampton
of Louisville, a close personal friend, to determine if he
knew anything about this. Hampton advised he did not know
but would ask and find out what hé could and call Duncan. He
later called back and gave the names. of some police officers
who. had been interviewed and named former Major Priest M. Fry:
former Major Robert Gregory; Lieutenant James Bibb; Sergeant
Brent Hardin and Lieutenant Vernon Austin. Hampton apparently
talked to Austin and advised that he had learned that the event’
was supposed to have taken place in the First District Offices
sometime in 1964 or 1965. Duncan called Lieutenant Vernon
Austin, whom he had known for 25 years, and asked him about the
matter. Austin related to Duncan who the Committee had asked
about and generally who was supposed to be present when the
alleged offer took place~

Duncan told the investigators that he had no recollection
concerning this matter and that he had in fact not slept and
walked the floor a number of nights for approximately ten days
to two weeks. At this time he recalled one night that Sergeant
William Baker of the First District Vice Squad met him in the

second floor hallway sometime in the afternoon and asked
Duncan to help him with a joke with a couple of officers
at the First District. ‘Duncan was told to go to the roll<call
at roll~eall time and say that he had heard that there wasa
$250,000 or $500,000 reward for the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King and was to add to or verify something that had already
been said. Duncan recalled going down to the area and making
the general statement that he had heard that there was a
$250,006 or $500,000-price on Dr. Martin Luther King from
either the Ku Klux Klan or the Communist Party. Duncan added
if verification was wanted, one should contact Bob Peters or
B. C. Brown of the FBI.

Duncan did not recall who was there except several
uniformed officers who were coming and going and that there
were several in the area, There were a number of questions
regarding whether it was'a big roll-call area or the Captain's,
Sergeant's, Lieutenant's offices or a hallway. Duncan was
asked whether or not there were three or a dozen people present
and Duncan replied that there could have been between three
and twelve people, exact number: unrecalled.

Duncan was asked whether Eob Peters was there. Duncan
said he did not recall his being there, otherwise he would
mot have made the statement that “if you want to verify the
price on Dr. Martin Luther King contact Bob Peters or B. C.
Brown." Duncan identified one person he thought wae there as
Arlie Blaire (because Duncan had heard that he was supposed to
have been there from tha questions asked). Duncan recalled a
younger, red-haired officer with a crew-cut or brush-cut.
Duncan said he had talked to Blaire and possibly his partner
in connection with a fugitive murder case that Duncan was
working. :

Danean was asked about his relationshiv with Robert Peters
and also with Fry, Hardin, Gregory, Bibb, Austin, Herman
Mitchell, John Mitchell and B. C. Brown of the FBI.

The Committee Investigators apparently could not under-
stand why Duncan could not remember who was at the meeting.
They asked Duncan about an attempted bombing of Sergeant Brent
Hardin's car and if Duncan worked on the case. Puncan recalled
a borib being placed on Hardin's car but that it apparently did
not go off. Duncan recalled it was possibly in conriection with

was to drive them and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, when
Kennedy came to Louisville to speak to a group on the 100th
Anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.
Duncan met Rev. A. D. Williams King with the Special agent in
Charge at his church as he met everyone else who was to appear
on the platform with Attorney General Kennedy as Duncan wanted
to be personally acquainted with everyone on the platform.

Duncan was asked if he knew Aaron Duke, Arlie Blaire'’s
partner, and Duncan replied that he did not recall hin.

Duncan was asked if he had heen the subject of ahy dis
ciplinary action as a result of this matter and he replied
that he had not.

Duncan was asked if he had brought this incident to the
attention of any of his supervisors and, if so, when. Duncan
replied that it was. brought to the attention of SA Danny 0.
Coulson, FBIHQ, when he knew that he was to be called to the
Committee for interview.

Duncan was asked if he ever surveilled pr. King and if
he knew of any telephone taps regarding Dr. King. Duncan
replied that hé did not surveil him and he had no personal
knowledge of any telephone taps.

i Duncan was asked if he thought the matter was a joke
and if he could see anything funny in it and Duncan replied
that at the time it was meant as a joke, but at the present
time it was a most serious and stupid thing, particularly in
light of events subsequent to 1965. Duncan stated he would
take a polygraph examination to verify that what he was saying
was true.

. Duncan was asked if he knew that Dr. King was a frequent
visitor in Louisville during the racially troubled period.
He advised that he recalled the racially troubled times really
climased after 1967. Duncan was asked if he would know arlie
Blaixe's voice and Duncan replied he did not think he would.

Bub-Committee to give sworn testimony on November 30, 1977,
and would a subpoena be necessary. Duncan advised a subpoena
would not be necessary. Duncan was given the phone number
of the Committee and told to contact Mr. Everhart should he

U. S. HOUSE : OF REPRESENTATIVES ,
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAI

On November 29, 1977, Duncan again contacted Comnittce
Staff Membors Hrs. Sheila Lee, Mr. Michael Everhart and Mr.
William Webb.

Dunean told them that he had recalled that he might have
known Aaron Duke, Arlie Blaire's partner. Duncan recalled a
person described as a white male, in his late 30's or early
40's as of 1965 or 1966, stocky, not fat, with gray cropped
hair, approximately 5’ 10" and 180-185-190 pounds.

Duncan advised that he had no first~hand knowledge of
Dr. King and Mr. Hoover's difficulty but that he had heard
rumors about it and had a faint recollection that he may have
mentioned this at the time he told of the Ku Flux Klan and/or
the Communist Party rumor in the First District Police area.

Duncan told them that he did not tell someone of his
recollection as a joke earlier because wen the communication
was received from the Burrau, it was pointed out that he would
be contacted regarding the matter by the Committee Investiga~
tors and that he would at that time be briefed by legal personnel
from FBIHQ.

Duncan was asked if ‘he had discussed this matter wth
anyone outside the Bureau and his family. Duncan told then
he had talked one time with Lieutenant Vernon Austin by phone
and he did not discuss the joke other than ask if it could
have been a joke. Duncan told them he had discussed it with
Robert Peters at least on three occasions. Once when it came
to his attention from a newspaper clipping, once when he re-
veived a communication from PBI Headquarters, and one tine after
he realized that it was a joke, at which time he told Peters
that he (Peters) and B. C. Brown had nothing to do with it.
Duncan was asked about their get-together for the football
gama on November ll~12, 1977. Duncan told them that Duncan
and Peters seriously considered not getting together for this
year's football game bat decided since they had known each
other for 25 years and had plans to attend this football game
for over a year, that they would go ahead and get together.
They agreed not to discuss the matter, however.

Duncan also told them that when he realized that it was
a@ joke and that he was involved, he contacted a Long-tine
personal friend and lawyer to assist in the analysis and action
regarding the entire matter.

professionally and that he had been discharged for being an
alcoholic, that he had cured himself without going to Alco~
holics Anohymous and he was there at the request of the
committee. He was asked by Duncan if he ever recalled working

have been a question asked and he could have replied something
about Mr. Hoover and Dr. King's relationship.

Louisville or St. Louis, if he had worked on the bombing
of Sergeant Brent Hardin's car, anj if he worked on a civil
rights case concerning Clifton Baird. Duncan replied nega-
tively to all these questions.

Duncan was given a statemont which allegedly was a trans-
eription of a recording between Arlie Blaire ani Clifton Baird
which discussed blacks and King in derogatory terns, and there
wore some references made to an offer. He was asked if this
was typical of the Louisville Police feelings at that time.

HOUSE SCLECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS,
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, :
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAN

Danecan was asked if he thought that the incident was
an offer by the FRI to kill Dr. King. Duncan replied that
it definitely was not. However, it was in poor taste and
something that should not have occurred. He was asked his
definition of a joke and Duncan gave his definition of a joke
as something made in fun. He was asked several times regard-
ing the anénymous nevspaper clipping suddenly appearing in the
EBI mail, and was this not a crack-pot way of doing things.
He added that Congressmen frequently receive anonymous itens.
in the mail also. 7

Hr. Stokes asked if SA DUNCAN knew that Dr. King had won
the Nobel Peace Prize and that he preached peace wherever he
went. Duncan replied he did know, but did not know the date.
Mr. Stokes stated that he thought the American public should
hear and judge this matter.

Dunean was asked where he was assigned and where he was
) physically the date that Dr. King was killed. He replied he

was assigned to the St. Louis Division and at the Hexic,
Missouri, Resident Agency.

Mr, Everhart. of the staff summed up the questioning by
‘asking if it was possible that P. M. Fry, Vernon Austin,
Robert Gregory, Brent Hardin, Herman Mitchell, Arlie Blaire,
and Robert Peters could have been present when the matter was
Gisecussed regayding Dr, King. Duncan replied that it was pos-
sible, but he had no recollection of any of then, especially
Peters.

SA Duncan acknowledged limited participation as described
in instant incident, but stated this was done on his own ini-
tiative spontaneously and wanted it known the FBI as an organi-
zation had no involvement whatsoever. Further, that he would
cooperate fully in resolving this matter satisfactorily.

7 fr. Lehner requested Duncan not to contact any of the
y police officers or dis¢uss his testimony with any of them.

the United States and Mexico “at $1000 to

52000 per trip.” Said Jerry Ray: “James

‘pssumed he was delivering dope or some
ther kind of contraband.”

“James is a crook,” said Jerry Ray.
“He's been one since he got out of the
Army, to make money without working.

“He thinks being a thief is an honorable:
: profession, but he never wanted ta be
‘known as a murderer.”

Now, says the brother of the man-

hof'a heart attack in three years, and the

+” Here is the story Jerry Ray told. the
Post-Dispatch of how James Earl Ray

» found himself in Memphis at the time the

* Rev. Dr. King was killed: ;

* “After he escaped’ from the Missouri
Penitentiary in 1967, he came to Chicago
and called me," said Jerry Ray, .“He

--later told me he didn’t escape in a bread

“truck as the story goes. He climbed over

+ the-wall on some pipes, like he did in

* Tennessee. ;

“When they fourd he was missing,

.they thought he was hiding inside the
prison as he had done on a previous
attempt. This gave him some valuable
time to walk along the railroad tracks
and get away. They put out the bread
truck story because James was working
in the bakery and they just figured that
‘was what happened. ?

““{ met him in Chicago when he got

“theré. He never once mentioned King or .|

,- any° other political matters. James
doesn’t give a damn about politics. He
never cared who was governor or who
was running the country. If you're a
racist ‘in prison, where he was, you're in
deep trouble. These stories that he

carried around pictures of Hitler and

“stuff, that’s a lot of bunk. He’s not
violent. When he was arrested on an |
‘armed robbery charge in St. Louis in

*, 1959, he had a gun but didn’t use it. Even |
the black prisoners in Tennessee think he |
was framed.” ane
- When Ray arrived in Chicago, said his |

ther, “he took a job as a dishwasher |
a restaurant in Winnetka, Afte a
uuple of days he was promoted to the

» ehfeteria line. He worked there ‘bix

ks until he got enough money; to pet.

. You.
‘After a while, James came back to
? Chicago and I could tell he had some- |
thing good. He asked me to céme to |
* Chicago by-train because he wanted to
4 give me his car."He said I should get new
“olicgnse plates: because the old ones were
hot. He said he was going to take a bus
to “Alabama for ‘a good job.’ He said
“Raoul told him.to establish residence in
Bitmingham and gave him $2000 to buy a

[7 4Raoul operated out of New Orleans,

. From there he started sending James out
Acfoss the country and into Mexico to
‘deliver cars. All over — Puerta Villarta, |
" Acapulco, the West Coast, New Orleans,

He was getting paid $1000 or $2000 a trip.
Hevfigured the cars might be full of dope |
“but he didn’t ask any questions. All he |
cared about was that he had a job and
was getting paid good. It was better than
being in Jeff City, he told me. James told
me-Raoul never talked politics, either.” |
‘James Earl Ray has said that a gun he
purchased was probably the one used to |
kill Dr. King.” This is his brother’s |
explanation: !
“James tells me that one day Raoul '
asked him to buy a gun in Alabama and
bring it to Memphis. At this point James
thought Raoul might also be in the gun- |

nning business. He brought the gun to»!
Raoul. He said it wasn’t the right kind,

 He‘picked it up from James at the new

ooking for a way to make some money]
‘That's where he met Raoul J
“ “He knew Raoul was a phony name
‘but he was using one, too. He used last
riames like Willard, Lohmyer, Eric Galt
‘“and'finally Sneyd. If you're a crook, you
don’t ask, ‘What's your name’ or, ‘what's |
» ithe car?” They'll think you're a cop or
stool pigeon and they wouldn’t hire |
m

ebel Motel just across the Mississippi

Ine from Memphis.
|| “Then Raoul told James to move into'a
Yoarding house in Memphis. In this job
\ James was always doing what he was
told. The money was good. James had
only been to Memphis once before in his
life. He kept getting lost there. He rented
the room in the name of Willard.
“Raoul came to the boardi and
| Sent James out on several other errands.
— to buy some binoculars’and other

| things. The afternoon Dr. King was shot,

Raoul told James he wanted to use the
Mustang that night. |.

-“There were three keys to-it. James
had one, Raoul had one, and he (James)
didn’t know who had the ‘third one.
James told him he would have to go get
a tire fixed because he had had a flat

“He drove to a service station nearby
\and they were busy. He talked to two
“attendants ‘for awhile. When he was
driving away he saw all this commotion,
police cars everywhere, He heard on the
radio that Dr. King had been killed.
When he heard they were Jooking for a
white Mustang, he realized he had been .
set up.”” : :

In the Mustang, James Ray discovered
a card stuffed into the seat, says Jerry
Ray. The front part was crossed out. The
back bor a name, Randy R-—, with a.
telephone number on it.

“Only James and my sister and myself
have known this name up to-now,’ said
Jerry Ray. “Plus the Assassinations
Committee. James kept this card.”

It was discovered by attorneys for
James Earl Ray that Randy R——
had homes in Miami and Gulfport, Miss.,
and that he was subsequently apprehend-

| ed in New. Orleans and convicted on a

dope charge, says’ Jerry Ray. ‘But

Department of Justice to the
media this week reads in

was to examine FBI activities

tion. “The report concluded

However, the report further
stated, “The FBY’s

subject.’”" i

Dr. King’s widow,
father, the Rev. Martin
Luther King Sr., other family
members and civil rights
leaders have éalled the latest
report from the house com-
mittee ‘‘unacceptable’’ to
them,

Shortly after this re-inves-
tigation into the King slaying
officially opened, it was re-
ported by the media that

numerous documents perti-.

nent to the King slaying case
were missing from the
government’s file.

Last week human rights
Dick Gregory,
announced that he will
resume his hunger fast until a
“thorough and true’
gation into Dr. King’s slaying
is initiated - which should
include the necessary FBI and
other legal government and
official documents on the
King case.

In addition to this, the U.S.
District Judge John Lewis: has
ordered the FBI to file with
the National Archives all of
its tapes and documents
growing out of buggings and

. wiretaps of Dr. King. Accord-

ing to the judge’s previous
records, these materials could
not be made available to the
public for at least 50 years,
except by court order.

A couple of months ago, Ed
Redditt, an ex-police
detective in Memyhis told the
National Inquirer Magazine in

“ss

his’

investi-

interview that he and
another Black officer, W.E.
Richmond, were the only
detectives assigned to policé
detail on April 4, 1968. He
stated that when police
officials in Memphis Iearned
of the many threats against
Dr. King’s life they “‘slasned
security from 10 men to two
men, instead of beefing it up.

“When Dr. King was
murdered I was miles away -
and another officer on duty
with me that day (W.B.
Richmond) was missing from

. the scene,” Redditt said.

Redditt said despite his
protests that he had-a job to
do, he was ordered home and
Holloman (then the director
of the Memphis Police and
Fire Department) called in
iwo burly police officers to
escort him there and stan:
guard over him.

Redditt further stated that
it appeared, “‘as if the guards
were irying.to keep me in the
house, rather than protect
me.” .

: Attorney General Bell said
at a recent news conference,

* although the report found no

evidence of FBI involvement
in the 1968 murder case of
Dr. King, the case was not
closed for the Justice Depart-
ment. .

He said a final decision wit.
be made when the House
Select Committee completes
its investigation of the killings
of both Dr. King and Pre-

*sident John F. Kennedy.

Of a possible meeting with
Ray, Bell stated: “‘I’d eithe:
0 or send someone in whon!
Thave absolute confidence.”

WASHINGTON — A tip from a former

Earl Ray provided the crucial clue that

fed to Ray’s arrest for the assassination

‘of the Rey, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a
~ Justice Department report has disclosed.
+ The cellmate remembered that Ray, as
a prisoner at Jefferson City, had talked
* about “the ease with which a person
_ living in Canada could obtain a false
« 1 passport,” the report said.

. | UNTIL THE interview with the uniden-

‘follow Ray’s trail only as far as Atlanta,
where he had driven immediately after

& vanished.

The Missouri tip triggered. a new
search, At the FBi's request, the Royal

files since Ray's escape from the prison

There were widespread rumors at the

Missouri prison that a group of business-

men had raised $100,000 to $i million “as

said, and there were also rumors that

“Ray was supposed to have killed three
black prisoners at the penitentiary.”

A major mystery remains to this day.

was able to discover the source of the

“photo equipment, and dance !essons, and

souri, through Ray as a prisoner at’

a oletel
for living expenses.

The FBI speculated that Ray commit.
ted several robberies or burglaries but
that was never proved. Ray was checked
as a possible participant in a 1967 bank
robbery at Alton, Ill., and in other
holdups around the country, but results

‘Qwere always negative.

* HE DID EARN $664 as a dishwasher in

{.a Chicago suburb, and at least once sent -

money out of the Missouri prison by .

money order to a fictitious company. But
nothing else could be established about
how Ray obtained several thousand
dollars, which he spent between his
escape and his arrest.

One expenditure was $269 on July 14,
1967, for purchase of 2 Plymouth automo-
bile in East St. Louis.

The FBI was criticized for alleged?
failure to follow 2 lead which the report;
described as ‘‘stiggesting that one ori
both of Ray’s brothers were in contact}.
with him after, and in aid of, his escape
in 1967 from (prison).”

The lead was not unearthed until after

” Ray’s arrest, and-the-FBL downgraded

b

the information as, “made sterile by
intervening events,” the report said, The
tip was that Jerry Ray may have seen
his brother James ‘at-a pre-arranged
meeting place in St. Louis shortly after
his escape,” the reports said.

“By hindsight, the task force believes
Jerry and John Ray could haye -been
effectively interrogated further to learn;
their knowledge, if any, of James Earl
Ray’s plans, his finances, and whether!
they helped him after King’ 'S death, the
report said. ‘ Balled
