restaurant and sat at the table at which the young man

had

been sitting. The source indicated that in the darkness he

did not recognize this person. He watched IATAROLA walk

over to this table and sit down.

The source stated that some time passed and he did

not pay too much attention to this other table until he

accidentally got a better glimpse of the person with whom

IATAROLA and the younger man had been sitting and recognized

that this person was PETER LICAVOLI, SR. The source stated

he had not seen LICAVOLI in many years, having initially

met LICAVOLI through JOSEPH BONANNO, SR. The source advised

that when he was operating a bar, LICAVOLI had offered to

provide him some furnishings

for

the bar, but the source

had declined.

be sent over to LICAVOLI's table, based on their old

friendship, but before the drinks could be delivered all

• three of the individuals att that table stood up and were

making ready to leave.

The source stated he went over to

them and greeted LICAVOLI. At first LICAVOLI did not

recognize him. However, When he did he warmly shook his hand

and put an arm around him in an Italian embrace: LICAVOLI

asked the source what he was doing and how he was doing.

LICAVOLI mentioned that he had just come in from out of

town and had to leave

right away, but he suggested that the

source look him up and they would get together for old

times sake.

LICAVOLI then left with the younger man and

JOSEPH IATAROLA returned to the source's table with the

source.

The source advised that this meeting between

IATAROLA and LICAVOLI could have several meanings. He

suggested one meaning to be that LICAVOLI may have a

hidden interest in the restaurant.. He stated that another

was that IATAROLA may have been showing off his "last

construction job" and had been soliciting LICAVOLI for his

business

in the presence of the source gave MULE $1,000 cash to help

him out of a bind.

The source stated that this was a gift

and not a loan.

The source added that MULE has received

several of these gifts from LICAVOLI. He said that several

of the Italians are of the opinion that BONANNO should be

taking care of MULE in view of their past close relationship.

tightness with his own wealth.

circus matter for LICAVOLI. He said LICAVOLI is presently

looking for a store out of

which to handle the picture

framing business .and he feels that LICAVOLI will probably

hire someone to manage the store for him.

The source commented on the apparent laziness

of LICAVOLI's sons, particularly MIKE and PETER, JR:

said that MIKE should actually be running the business.

inasmuch as it was originally his in Mexico. However,

if there is any actual work and responsiblity to be handled,

MIKE LICAVOLI dodges it: PETER LICAVOLI, JR. is the same,

according to the source.

The source

stated that TED LICAVOLI is in Detroit

and is trying to break into the entertainment world. He

sings and plays a musical instrument with a group in Detroit.

The source advised that JOSEPH CARUSOM has gotten

out of the Continental Restaurant. He did not know the specific

reason for this, but he speculated that it was probably

because of theinterest being generated by local police and

the state authorities about possible "Mafia" influence in

the Continental Restaurant.

The source stated that the

Continental is now owned solely by ANTHONY CELLA and his wife.

He said their business is not too good now and that if it

is not reversed soon it will be bankrupt.

On 6/29/70, PCI FRANK T. MOORE, Director, King

of the Road Motor Inns, Adams Hotel, Phoenix, Arizona,

advised that during January or February, 1970, PETE LICAVOLI

and his wife appeared at the Adams Hotel in the company of

HERB APPLEGATE, who was then leasing the hotel under the

auspices of the Hobo Joe Corporation. APPLEGATE introduced

the LICAVOLIs to the PCI and from ensuing com ersation the

PCI gathered that APPLEGATE and LICAVOLI were long-time

friends; having developed this friendship years ago in

Michigan. Through APPLEGATE's assistance and

approval, LICAVOLI made arrangements with the PCI to display

25 paintings throughout the hotel lobby. These paintings

were each advertised for sale through the Vesuvio Art

Gallary, 40 West Grand River, Detroit, Michigan, and 15126

Mack Avenue, Grosse Point, Michigan.

The PCI was furnished

a price list with instructions to communicate with

PETE LICAVOLI through Tucson telephone number 298-4774

(ranch) or 296-9458 (home) in the event a sale was made.

The PCI stated that to date no sale of paintings

has been negotiated, thus he has had no further contact

with LICAVOLI. The

PCI added that HERB APPLEGATE, through

the Hobo Joe Corporation, has recently relinquished his

lease right to the Adams Hotel.

Because of this, the

PCI stated he intends to contact LICAVOLI and request that

the latter remove the paintings from the hotel.

The PCI stated that apparently APPLEGATE and his

corporation over-extended financially in establishing a

Hobo Joe outlet in fashionable Los Arcos Mall, Scottsdale,

Arizona: In view of this, the Hobo Joe Corporation requested

permission to withdraw from the. Hotel Adams lease.

This was approved, thus that corporation no longer has any

interest in the hotel.

On 6/30/70, PX 777-C-TE advised that during a

recent meeting with VICTOR TRONOLONE, accountant for the

subject, the sour ce mentioned that he had run into LICAVOLI

at the Baron of Arizona Restaurant. He stated that

TRONOLONE appeared unusually disinterested in this remark,

which caused some suspicions to arise on the part of the

source. He stated that TRONOLONE could normally be expected

to show some interest in this

remark and it was the opinion

of the source that the lack of interest was intentional

and could mean the TRONOLONE knew of some interest of LICAVOLI

in this restaurant about which he did not want to open the

conversation.
