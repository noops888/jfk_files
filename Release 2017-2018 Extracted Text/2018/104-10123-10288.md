2. A review of Subject's file indicates that his approval for

Agency duties were based primarily on his satisfactory prior employ-

ment as a Special Agent of the FBI.

3. Under our agreement with AEC to furnish all available in

vestigative reports the FBI was contacted through Mr. Papich and the

appropriate investigative reports were requested. Mr. Papich has

advised that Mr. O'Connell is in the category of a few former FBI

Agents on whom no written reports are available.

He indicated that

Mr. O'Connell had been approved as a Special Agent at a period when

time was of the essence in obtaining qualified Agents. As a result

the security approval was made on the basis of teletype investigative

reports and formal written reports were not made in Subject's case.

4.

Mr. Papich agreed that the FBI had no objection to our

releasing to AEC a copy of their memorandum to CIA dated 23 January

1952 which indicated the dates of Subject's employment with the Bureau

and the fact that his services had been entirely satisfactory•

5. Mr. Papich further suggested that Mr. Barl Lane, oi AbUs

who is also a former FBI Agent be informed oi the unique circumstances

involved and be informed that he may contact Mr. Papich for further

details regarding Subject's case.
