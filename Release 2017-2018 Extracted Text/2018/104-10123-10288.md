Agency duties were based primarily on his satisfactory prior employ-
ment as a Special Agent of the FBI.

vestigative reports the FBI was contacted through Mr. Papich and the
appropriate investigative reports were requested. Mr. Papich has
advised that Mr. O'Connell is in the category of a few former FBI
Agents on whom no written reports are available. He indicated that
Mr. O'Connell had been approved as a Special Agent at a period when
time was of the essence in obtaining qualified Agents. As a result
the security approval was made on the basis of teletype investigative
reports and formal written reports were not made in Subject's case.

who is also a former FBI Agent be informed of the unique circumstances
involved and be informed that he may contact Mr. Papich for.further
