DATE AS SASROBLEM

Re Las Vegas airtel to Bureau

dated 2/7/63 and

Bureau airtel to Chicago dated 2/15/63. (U)

"Brucie," mentioned by KORSHAK is unknown to this

office.

Negotiations regarding the Stardust came to the

attention of this office during the fall of 1960 from

CG 6343-C*.

During this period, MURRAY HUMPHREYS, et al,

were in constant contact with KORSHAK, who was a central

figure

in the negotiations. (U)

Concerning GIANCANA's whereabouts and activities

during the pertinent period, various sources, including

CG 6486-C* advised that GIANCANA was definitely in Chicago

during the period February 2 through February 7, 1963,

and immediately prior to that period, advised his associates

he had been in Florida and was in contact with WILLIAM DADDANO

there. It is possible that KORSHAK was in contact with

GIANCANA either in Chicago or in Florida. (U)

Concerning PHYLLIS MC GUIRE, according to CG 6486-C*,

GIANCANA advised of the fact that the

Internal Revenue Service

has been attempting to learn whether or not he and MC GUIRE

are married. It appeared from the brief conversation that

they are not. Further, GIANCANA has been observed during the

past two weeks in company with a Chicago girl friend named

BRIGIT CLARK, and has been seen with other unidentified

females.
