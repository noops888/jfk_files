FF office, Negotiations regarding the Stardust came to the
\ attention of this office during the fall of 1960 from
CG 6343-C*, During this period, MURRAY HUMPHREYS, et al,
were in constant contact with KORSHAK, who was a central figure
. in the negotiations. (C2)

. Concerning GIANCANA's whereabouts and activities
during the pertinent period, various sources, including
CG 6486-C* advised that GIANCANA was definitely in Chicago
during the period February 2 through February 7, 1963,
and immediately. prior to that period, advised his associates
he had been in Florida and was in contact with WILLIAM DADDANO
there. It is possible that KORSHAK was in contact with
GIANCANA either in Chicago or in Florida. (4

‘Concerning PHYLLIS MC GUIRE, according to CG 6486-C*,
GIANCANA advised of the fact that the Internal Revenue Service
has been attempting to learn whether or not he and MC GUIRE
