The Committee has asked me to talk with you

today about the future of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I thought it might be helpful if I outline quite briefly
some of the points I would like to make, some of the
problems I think ought to be considered, and some of the
steps we have taken.

The first point is that the statutory base
for the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully
satisfactory. The basic statutory provision is 28 USC
533 which provides that the Attorney General may appoint
officials "(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against the
United States; (2) to assist in the protection of the
President; and (3) to conduct such investigations regarding
official matters under the control of the Department of
Justice and the Department of State as may be directed by
the Attorney General." There are other statutes, such
as the Congressional Assassination, Kidnapping and Assault
Act, which vest in the Bureau special responsibilities to
investigate criminal violations. In addition, there are
Executive orders and Presidential statements or directives
which place investigatory responsibilities upon the Bureau.

A number of questions are often asked about this

statutory base. It has the virtue of simplicity, but the

Executive orders which deal with government employee

investigations are complicated and confusing, and Presidential

NW 55012 DoclId:32989601 Page 11



-2-

“ memoranda or, perhaps, oral instructions from a President
may be difficult to collate. I think it is important,
in any case, to separate out the kinds of questions which
are asked about the Bureau's authority base. Some questions
are constitutional in nature, relating to the inherent power
of the President; others go to the interpretation of the
statutes and the relationship between the statutes and
Presidential directives; others go to the failure of the
statutes to define sufficiently the areas of the Bureau's
jurisdiction or to spell out sufficiently--and this is
partly constitutional--the means and methods which the Bureau
is permitted to use in carrying out its assigned tasks.

The second point, related to the first, is a
continuing discussion of the role of the Bureau in intelligence
investigations or domestic security investigations. The
argument is sometimes made that the Bureau's proper role,
at least in purely domestic matters, should be limited to
investigations of committed crimes. The basic statute for
the Bureau is broader than this, as have been Executive
ordérs and Presidential mandates to the Bureau. The basic
statute is broader, since it refers to investigations
regarding official matters under the control of the Department
of Justice and the Department of State as may be directed
by the Attorney General. A disparity is sometimes seen
among the different roles of the Bureau in crime detection,
in on-going domestic security matters, and in foreign

intelligence or foreign counterintelligence matters. In

NW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 12



recent days a statement by the then Attorney General Harlan

Fiske Stone, who reorganized the Bureau and chose J. Edgar

Hoover as its director, has been quoted as a relevant

warning.

Stone warned, "There is always the possibility

that a secret police may become a menace to free government ;

and free institutions, because it carries with it the
possibility of abuses of eouee which are not always quickly
apprehended or understood .... It is important that its
activities be strictly limited to the performance of those

functions for which it was created and that its agents

themselves be not above the law or beyond its reach ....

The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned with political
or other opinions of individuals. It is concerned only
with their conduct and then only with such conduct as is
forbidden by the laws of the United. States. When a police
system passes beyond these limits, it is dangerous to the
proper administration of justice and to human liberty, which
it should be our first concern to cherish."

I should like to suggest that Stones’ warning always
must be considered relevant to the proper conduct of the
Bureau's duties, but it does not necessarily follow that
domestic security investigations are, therefore, outside
the Bureau's proper functions. The detection of crime in
some areas requires preparation and at least some knowledge

of what is likely to be going on. What is at issue, I think,

NW 55012 DoclId:32989601 Page 13



@ ®

is the proper scope, the means and methods used, the attention
paid to conduct and not views, and the closeness of the
relationship of the conduct and that which is forbidden by
the laws of the United States.

Third, I realize that some proposals, since I
was asked about this when I last appeared before this
Committee, might separate out in some fashion domestic and
foreign intelligence functions from the FBI cr from one
another within the FBI. This is, of course, an issue to
be looked at. I assume it is recognized that there may
be some relationship between that intelligence which is
domestic and that intelligence which is involved in foreign
counterintelligence work. One may lead to the other.
And there may be a relationship between foreign counter-
intelligence and foreign intelligence. If the work were
separated out into different agencies, I do not know if
the decision about when an investigation should pass
from one agency to another always could be made easily.
Moreover, even so, information presumably would pass from
one agency to the other. JI know that one consideration
has been that it might be decided that information collected
by some permitted means in intelligence investigations
under some circumstances should not be used in criminal
prosecutions. But if there is an exchange of information,
this must always be a consideration, whether there are
séparate agencies or not, and the basic question then is one

AW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 14



AW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 15

of use and not organization. The more active concern,

I believe, is that there is a risk that conduct proper for

one area may be improper for another, and that the combination
can work a contamination. My view on this is that in any

case we must decide what conduct is appropriate and is
inappropriate for each of the areas, and we must take

steps to make sure that proper conduct is lived up to. My hope
is that the fact that the FBI has criminal investigative
responsibilities,which must be conducted within the confines
of constitutional protections strictly enforced by the courts,
gives the organization an awareness of the interests of
individual liberties that might be missing in an agency
devoted solely to intelligence work. I know the argument

can be run the other way. I believe the dangers are greater

if there is separation.



lines
NW 55012  DocId:32989601° Page

Fourth, there is a question as to the proper role of

the FBI in crime prevention and whether or not it should be
considered authorized to take steps under some circumstances
to reduce the likelihood that crimes will be committed

or that serious injury to persons or property will occur.
Preventive action has raised serious questions and these
must be dealt with. I suppose an initial question is
whether it should be allowed at all. Yet I believe under
special citcumstances and with proper controls most would
believe this to be a proper function,

Fifth, the problem of proper controls, supervision and
accountability is all-embracing. By statute the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice,
and also by statute the Attorney General is the head of the
Department of Justice. The history is mixed, of course, and
we all have a tendency to over-simplify, but it is 4 fair
statement that there have been times in the past when the
supervision by Attorneys General, granted that the Bureau must
have considerable autonomy, has been sporadic, practically
nonexistent, or ineffective. I hope that is not the case now.
The responsibility is a heavy one. But in any event the prob+
lem of proper controls, supervision and accountability goes
beyond the Director of the Bureau and the Attorney General.

I have already mentioned that in my view the statutory base for
the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully satis-
factory. I think that better controls and performancé can

be achieved through statutory means, executive orders, guide-

and reporting to appropriate congressional committees.

Sixth, before I come to a resume of some of the steps
which have been taken, let me say I know we all realize that
in the past there have been grave abuses. I am uncomfortable with
a kind of writing of history, however, which sees it only in terms
of the abuses and not in terms of past and present strength. It
is very difficult to be fair to the past in which many institutions
of government carried a share of responsibility. But more than
unfairness is involved. If we are not careful, we will turn to
solutions of the moment which a better reading of history might
indicate are not the best solutions. I know we must seize the
moment, if I may use such a phrase in this setting. I know also
that this Committee realizes that a very important agency with
dedicated, highly professional, greatly disciplined government
servants is involved. The importance is to the security and domestic
tranquility of the United States. Stone's warning was given in an
act of creation. He was proud of his creation. In spite of the
abuses, there is a proper place for pride. I take it our mutual
work should be to nurture that pride and the conditions which
justify it.

I turn now to a review of some of the steps which have been
taken or are in progress. We have tried most diligently, under safe-
guards to protect the privacy of individuals and with an awareness
of the unfairness of instant history to give a great deal of informa-
tion to Congressional committees. Attorney General Saxbe made public
and Deputy Attorney General Silberman and Director Kelley testified
about the so-called COINTELPRO. When the FBI discovered evidence

of several more COINTELPRO projects after I



6.

became Attorney General, these were revealed. One of my first
acts as Attorney General, my third week in office, was to testify
before a Congressional committee about possible incidents of
political misuse of the FBI by the White House in the past and

about the riature of FBI file-keeping systems, particularly the

files kept by Director Hoover in his office suite. Director Kelley
has spoken publicly and before congressional committees about incidents
in the past in which FBI agents engaged in break-ins to gather

or photograph physical evidence in intelligence investigations. On

a number of occasions, most recently in testimony before this

Committee, I have described the history of the use of electronic
sutveillance by the FBI. We have welcomed such opportunities.

On February 26, 1975, I instructed Director Kelley to report to
me any requésts made of thé Bureau, or practices within the Bureau,
which he deems improper or which present the appearance of impropriety.
On February 28, 1975, Director Kelley ordered FBI personnel to report
such requests or practices to him. In July, 1975, I reaffirmed my
February directive and also asked for a report of all sensitive
investigative practices. The Director promptly complied.

Director Kelley has regularly provided information on conduct
by Bureau agents and programs underway within the Bureau that
could raisé questions. These matters have been reviewed and
discussed within the Deparmtt so that a consistent and appro-
priate policy can beGbhieved. This is a continuing process.

I do not assert that we are aware of everything about the Bureau.

Nor do I suggest that we ought to know everything. Appropriate

HW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 18

communication, consultation and supervision at this level
have to be selective. I'make this point, which I think may
sound disconcerting, not in any way to minimize the respon-
sibility of the Bureau to keep the Department informed nor

to minimize the Department's duty to find out. Rather

| I want to be realistic about a learning and organization

| problem which requires realism if it is to be understood

and perfected.

With respect to possible legislation, the Department
has in preparation various drafts of possible bills which may
be of assistance in the area of what is now warrantless
electronic surveillance. Although cbtaining a judicial warrant
does not automatically eradicate the possibility of abuse,
it is perceived to be an important safeguard of individual
privacy interests, and we are exploring, as we said we would

do, various possibilities and alternatives.

NW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 19

Finally, a committee within the Department of Justice --
chaired by Mary Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the
Office of Legal Counsel, and composed of representatives of my
office, the Criminal and Civil Rights Divisions, the Office of
Policy and Planning, and the FBI -- has been working for eight
months reviewing FBI. procedures in many areas and drafting guide-
lines to govern those procedures “in’ the future. The Committee has
produced draft guidelines covering White House inquiries,

A congressional and judicial staff appointment investigations,
unsolicited mail, and domestic security investigations. It is
currently at work on guidelines covering counterespionage investi-
gations and will later consider the use of informants, the employee
loyalty program, organized crime intelligence investigations,
criminal investigations, and other aspects of FBI practice.

The Committeé's work has been extensive and time-consuming. It
has involved not only questions of proper safeguards but also of
efficiency in the proper functioning of the Bureau. It has
been an effort to translate into words the complicated and
important mechanisms for controlling the FBI. I hope the
Committee's efforts at articulation will be of use to this Com-
mittee and others as it considers drafting legislation. i
You have received copies of the latest drafts of the
guidelines that have been substantially completed by the Committee.
These guidelines do not yet represent Department policy. There
is.disagreement within the Department on some aspects of these

guidélines. I have disagreed with the Committee recommendations -

NW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 20

-~ l-

from time to time, and the FBI has raised substantial questions
about other recommendations--particularly with respect to the
treatment of unsolicited mail. Some of the proposals in the
guidelines could be promulgated as departmental regulations. )
Congress may feel some ought to be enacted into statutory law. ,
Other provisions would require implementation by executive order.
I would be glad to discuss these draft guidelines with
you in detail in response to your questions, but a brief discussion
of the guidelines on domestic security may be useful at the outset.
The guidelines begin by attempting to impose some order
and definiteness to the domestic security field. To begin
with, these guidelines do not deal with FBI efforts to counter-
act the work of foreign intelligence services operating within
the United States. Standards for determining when there is
foreign involvement sufficient to place a subject in the category
of foreign counterintelligence investigation are now being debated
within the guidelines committee. The domestic security guidelines
also are not meant to cover security or background investigations
of federal appointees or investigations of ordinary crimes. Under
the draft guidelines, domestic security investigations are only
to be authorized when there is a likelihood that the activities
of individuals or groups involve or will involve the use of force
or violence in violation of federal law. Domestic security invés-
tigations are to be limited to activities of individuals or groups
intended to accomplish one of five purposes: overthrowing the
government of the United States or of a State; interfering with

the activities within the United States of foreign governments

HW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 21



-12-

or their representatives; influencing government policies by inter-
fering by force or violence with government functions or interstate
commerce; depriving individuals of their civil rights; and creating

domestic violence or rioting when such violence or rioting would

necessitate as a countermeasure the use of Federal armed forces:

There is also a provision for limited investigation when there is a
clear and immediate threat of domestic violence which is likely to
result in a request by a state for Federal armed assistance.

Currently there is no procedure requiring the review outside the
FBI of all domestic intelligence investigations conducted by the FBI,
though the FBI has a long-standing policy of reporting its investi-
gative findings to the Criminal Division. Under the draft guidelines
there would be a comprehensive program of reporting to the Attorney
General or his designee of all preliminary and full domestic intel-
ligence investigations. The Attorney General would be required under
the draft guidelines to put a stop to any full investigation whose.
justification did not meet an established standard. The standard :
would be that there must be specific and articulable facts giving reason

, to believe that the individual or group under inves-

tigation is engaged in the activities I have just listed.

Another feature of the draft guidelines is to place

strict controls upon the use of any technique by the FBI which
goes beyond the gathering of information. COINTELPRO was the
name given the use of some such techniques. As I have said
before, some of the activities in COINTELPRO were outrageous

and the others were foolish. Nonetheless, there may be circum-

'

- 13 -

stances involving an immediate risk to human life or to extraordin-

arily important government functions that .could only be
countered by some sort of preventive action. The guidelines
require that any such preventive action proposal be submitted
to the Attorney General. He could authorize the preventive
action only when there is probable cause to believe that the
violence is. imminent and when such measures are necessary to
minimize the danger to life or property. The preventive action
would in all cases have to be nonviolent. The Attorney General
would be required to report to Congress periodically and no less
often than once a year on the use of preventive action by the
FBI.

I make no claim that during this rather difficult but
interesting and--I must trust--promising period we have
achieved all that might have been possible. in many ways the
work has been disappointingly slow. But I do think we have
made advances in nurturing and helping to improve a structure
which will be supportive of the best efforts of the men and
women in the Department of Justice and in the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. No procedures are fail-safe against abuse.

The best protection remains the quality and professionalism of

the membersof the Bureau and of the Department.

N This informative memorandum is to récord a matter

7 of particular interest which was discussed at a conference
12/3/75, attended by Deputy Associate Director J. B. Adams,
Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, and Supervisors D. Ryan
and S. F. Phillips of the Intelligence Division, with
Assistant Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh and
Criminal Division Attorneys Kevin Maroney and Phil White
in Thornburgh's office.,

Thornburgh evinced an interest in the recent
extensive publicity generated by the media concerning the
Senate Select Committee's (SSC) "exposure! at public hearings
lof the alleged mailing in 1964 to Mrs. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
‘of a tape recording and anonymous letter concerning her
husband, You will recall that a key item in the "exposure!
was the anonymous letter, the original typing of which was |?
found earlier this year among personal papers left behind cna
by former Assistant to the Director William C, Sullivan
when he retired. For ready reference, a copy of that letter
is attached to the enclosure of instant memorandum,

In response to Thornburgh's interest, Phillips
furnished a rather detailed summary of facts and recollections,
using as a "pony" a Work Paper, In making reference to the
Work Paper, Phillips merely indicated that he set down in
writing some notes which he felt were pertinent and then
proceeded to brief the conferees from the notes of our

Work Paper. A copy of that Work palate dated AERA ae

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

A very significant factor which emerges from the

Work Paper is that the person who was the architect of the
mailing to Mrs. King of a tape and anonymous letter was
undoubtedly Sullivan, It was pointed out by Phillips that
in the SSC public hearings on 11/18/75, the SSC Staff entered
into the record a denial of Sullivan of knowing anything
about the anonymous letter and Sullivan's claim that it was
a "plant." Phillips pointed out the unfairness on the part
of the SSC in entering only that portion of Sullivan's
"testimony" to the SSC and that the SSC did not put on the
record anything else which Sullivan may have said concerning
the mailing of the tape and anonymous letter, (It should be

arenthetically noted that there is very strong indication
from information we have, particularly from former Special
Agent Lish Whitson, that Sullivan has told the SSC, either
directly or indirectly, of some part he*had played in the

mailings.) *Sullivan

_ It was also strongly emphasized to the conferees
that, fotwithstanding the efforts of the SSC and the media,
the aforementioned anonymous mailings should not be placed
in the same category as the various official COINTELPRO-type
activities the Bureau engaged in in an effort to discredit
King, It was urged that the tape and letter mailings must
be viewed as the work of a single individual not officially
approved or condoned by any higher authority in the FBI,

At the end of Phillips' briefing, Thornburgh
inquired as to what part former Assistant to the Director
Alan H, Belmont played in these anonymous mailings and what
knowledge he might have of them, Phillips responded that
other than the two situations referred to in the Work Paper--
and these did not necessarily involve Belmont--Phillips
knew of no Belmont involvement or awareness. The two situations

WORK PAPER

Recollections of

SA Se : Phillips
RE: THE MARTIN LUTHER RING, IR. CASE

Three recent significant events suggest that I now
reduce to uriting by this informal Work Paper, certain of ny
recollections of events which occurred about 10 years ago
when I supervised at Headquarters the FBI investigation of
Martin Luther King, Jr. 1t is emphasized that these are mere
recollections and they should be viewed in that light. To
set the stage for these recollections, the following are the
three significant events of reference;

(1) On Sunday, 1/26/75, I was called into the
office to assist in a "special" being coordinated by the
Inspection Division, one aspect of which related to the King
ease. I, accompanied by J. G. Deegan, Section Chief, IS-1
Section, INLD, was instructed to obtain and inventory 7draver
full of folders pertaining to King then being maintained in
a cabinet in a room adjoining Mr. J. B. Adams' office. Ve
learned that the material in question had been maintained by -
former Assistant to the Director W. C. Sullivan and vas left _
behind upon his retirement. In the inventorying of this
material, vhich was primarily handled by P. E. Nugent of IS-1
Section (I having been redirected to another phase of the
“special"), there vas noted a document which I considered
at the time of extreme significance,

The document involved (Xerox attached) is the original
of what appears to be an undated letter addressed merely "King."
It has no signature or other indication of the author. The
letter indicates it is written by a Negro and suggests strongly
that the letter is intended as a cover communication as evidenced
by the folloving quotation therein, "Lend your seaually
psychotic ear to the enclosure." Other language in

Enclosure

' AW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 27



the letter reveals the writer to be referring to personal,
misconduct of a sexual nature and that recordings of same are
available.

CIt might parenthetically be noted at this point
that even though the comminication found is an original typing,
it is my belief that if such a letter was intended to be sent
anonymously to King by Sullivan, it would have been very logical
to have prepared the letter with a carbon copy and that copy
used as the cover communication for any enclosure, thus minimizing
the likelihood of tracing through typewriter examination.)

(2) "fhe New York Times," 3/9/75, carried a Lengthy
article about the FBI investigation of King and included many
allegations concerning technical coverage of King. Highlighted
in the article is a claim that the FBI anonymously mailed to
Mrs. King a tape depicting King's personal life adversely.

The article claimed that a “former high FBI official" had brought
the matter to the attention of "The New York Times" and asked
to remain anonymous. Article alleged that in late 1964 a copy
of a tape recording was made by the FBI Laboratory, wrapped in
a small, plain unmarked package with no return address, and
delivered to Sullivan's office. Allegedly, it was addressed

to Mrs. King in Atlanta, Georgia. Another source deseribed

as "attached to the Bureau at the time" said he believed the
recording was of a party held by King and others in the Willard
Hotel in Washington, D.C. ‘he article went on to state that
the tape and package had been prepared so as to not be traceable
and that Mr. Hoover vanted the tape mailed from somewhere in
Florida. Sullivan ordered a Special Agent (SA) to fly to Tampa
and mail the tape to Mrs. King, the source stressing that the
SA had no idea of the contents. Article went on to state that
Mes. King said in a telephone interview (time not disclosed)
that she recalled receiving a tape recording in 1/65 and that
she and her husband had listened to it and found much of it
unintelligible.

The appearance of the foregoing newspaper article
caused me to de certain research in our files in an effort to
determine vhether or not we had any information to substantiate
or dispute the allegations. We found that there was no infor-
mation in Bureau files to confirm that a tape vas mailed by Bureau

JEK Law 10(a}1



So much for the three matters of significance
related above which now make important the occurrences of
events about 10 years ago which are as follows:

I was in my office in vhat vas then the Internal
Security Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division
(DID) in the Riddell Building, 1730 K Street, WN. W.,
Vashington, D. C. My office was directly across the hall
from the office of 1. C. Sullivan, then Assistant -Director of
the DID. Some of my covorkers vere also present as we vere
engaged in some special vork on the King case and related
matters, This incident was on a Saturday.

Sometime during the morning Sullivan came into my ee
office and asked me for some unvatermarked stationery. I
secured some from my secretary's desk and after checking it
through the light, I offered it to Sullivan. He asked me
if I was absolutely certain that the paper vas unvatermarked. 7
IT assured him that it was and he took it inte his private office.
Sometime later that morning he telephoned me for the address
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference headquarters in
Atlanta, Georgia, and may also have asked me for King's home
address in Atlanta, although my recollection of the latter is
not as clear as the former. I procured the address or addresses,
jotted them on a piece of paper and hand carried them inte
Sullivan's private office. He seemed to be busily at vork at
a typewriter on a stand next to his desk. 1 gave him the
address or addresses and again he asked me if I vas absolutely
certain that the stationery I had given him was unvatermarked.
My assurance to him vas reiterated once again.

Some time later, I would estimate around noon,
Sullivan called me inte his office and handed me a sealed
manila envelope which appeared contained something other
than written matter as it was a solid package. He gave me
a sum of money and asked that I have one of the men vorking
crith me immediately take the package by cab to the Justice
Building and hand it over to Al Belmont (then Assistant to the
Director). I feel quite certain that it vas Belmont to vhom
the package vas te be delivered but I ould not discount completely

DocId:32989601 Page 30



=n

aaa | <q

the possibility that it may have been Cartha Deleach to whom
it was to be delivered. I remember that one of the men working
with me vanted te go dowmtovn to do some shopping and it thus
vas convenient to have him perform the courier chore dictated
by Sullivan.

At approximately the same point in time that the
above event occurred, at Sullivan's direction, I arranged
to gather into one place all the tapes we had of microphone
coverage we had been conducting on King. All these tapes
originated in various field offices and we had those mailed
to the Bureau. Some that had already been mailed in were
being maintained by 2ecords. It was my task to gather all
tapes from the field and those in Records and have them in
one place. While they were technically charged to Sullivan
and for the record being retained in Sullivan's office, as a
practical matter, I was maintaining these tapes in my office
across the hall from Sullivan's office. Among the tapes I
was accumulating vere some vhich for a short period of time
were in the hands of SA John M. Matter (then a supervisor
in the Radio Engineering Section of the Laboratory, now retired).
I remember Matter telling me that he had been instructed on a
very confidential basis te perform a particular task relating
to some of the tapes we had. I am not now sure as te vho
gave him the instructions but .ami_ quite certain that it vas
likely to have been Sullivan, vith an outside possibility that
he may have got his instruetions from Belmont, His own
instructions concerned making some composite tapes and he
sent over to me several reels with labels shoving they vere
“edited composite" highlighting reels of tape from WFO and
Los Angeles, Because of the very confidential nature of
Matter's assignment I, of course, did not query him other than
in respect to the following. From the labels on these tapes
I gathered there were a specific number that he had prepared
and it appeared to me thet the number he sent me vas one or
two short of the number /f)had prepared. I was unable to get
any exact accounting from Matter concerning the shortage.

Sometime shortly thereafter, I obtained the information
discussed under number two abova concerning a conversation 1/5/65
betveen King and an assistant indicating that a tape had been

’ NW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 31



pT @ e

mailed te King. When I learned this information, it appeared
Likely to me that if a tape had been mailed to King it might
be the one which appeared to be "missing.'' I had an occasion
at that time to bring te Matter's attention what I had learned
from the overhear in Atlanta and I suggested that this was
perhaps the ansver to the "missing" tape, Still maintaining
the confidentiality of the sensitive assignment that had been
entrusted to him, Matter made no affirmative or informative
replies to my suspicions but rather omiled "knowingly." As
far as I was concerned at the time, ve had something of an
implied meeting of the minds and I was personally convinced,
though I had no hard evidence to c<upport my conviction, that
Sullivan had coma greatis part in mailing a tape to King.

I might add that I didn’t at that time conceive of any
comminication being sene with the tape. The finding of the
document discussed under number one above of course changed
my thinking relative to a cover commmication accompanying the
mailing of the tape.

The foregoing represents my best recollections
at this time on these matters.

I might also use this Vork Paper to set out some
further observation, for whatever value it might be.

The document addressed to King, a copy of vhich is
attached, contains a statement in the closing paragraph “King,
there is only one thing left for you to de. You knov what it
is. You have just 34 days in which te do (this exact number
has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite
practical significant}. You are done. There is but one way
out for you." TI have often vondered what the significance of
the 34 days quoted vas, when I learned of Vhitson's mission on
11/21/64 I used that date as a starting point. Thirty-four
days after 11/21/64 was 12/25/64, Christmas Day. Recognizing
Ring's position as a man of the cloth and having many, many
times heard Sullivan decry King as a hypocrite because of his
inmoral activities although a preacher, it oceurred to me that
in Sullivan's mind he was probably trying to direet King's
attention to Christmas Tay.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

A search of the Martin Luther King, Jzr., and related
files failed to result in the positive Identification of
material prepared by the Domestic Intelligence Division sub-
sequent to April 23, 1964, in refutation of Martin Luther
King's statement to the press in San Francisco, California,
on April 23, 1964, referred to in Mr. Sullivan‘s memorandum
that date to Mr. Belmont captioned "Communist Party, USA,
Negro Question, Communist Influence in Racial Matters ISs-c"
delivered herewith.

It may be surmised, however, that a document under
preparation in the then Domestic Intelligence Division in April,
1964, entitled “Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist
Influence in Racial Matters," represents the material referred
to in Mr. Sullivan's memorandum of Avril 23, 1964. ‘hat
document is a lengthy work paper which was periodically brought
up to date to show every facet of information available re-
garding communist influence in the racial movement and does ©
contain information in refutation of King's statement of
April 23, 1964, which in essence challenged the FBI to provide
evidence regarding the commumist infiltration in the vacial
movement. A copy of this document was furnished the SSC by
memorandum dated October 6, 1975.

With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notations appear as to reason for
excision, the excision was made for the reason that the infor-
mation actually summarizes or quotes from conversations monitored
during electronic surveillances of King. In some cases, it
can be ascertained precisely what information in FBI files came
from electronic surveillances of King; however, there exist
areas where documentation of the information is not precise
and no acctirate determination can be made. Therefore, no .
assurances can be given that portions of the materials being
furnished do not contain information developed as a result of
electronic surveillances of King.

Reverend halph D, Abernathy, Treasurer; Andrew Jd.

organization's Washington, D. C., office.

The meeting was most amicable and King indicated
that he had requested to see me in an effort to clear up any mis-~
understandings that we might have. He epologized for remarks
attributed to him criticizing the FBI and me with specific reference
to Albany, Georgia, He stated that in this connection he had either

“been mfsquoted or there had been an outright misrepresentation.

2 ba He said that while some Negroes have complained to
hfatthatdhe FBI has been ineffective in investigating civil rights
visigiong. he personally discounts such complaints and said he
appiyoing the fine work the FEI has been doing in this regard,

being friendly toward these same officers. He said situations like
this serve to breed Negro distrust ior the FBI. I advised
Reverend King that I was aware that allegations of this nature

had been made and that I had looked into the matter. Ht was
determined that these charges were without basis.

Reverend King categorically denied ever having made
a personal attack on me and also denied that he had ever instructed
Negroes not to coopcrate with the FBI. I told him that when Negroes
are encouraged not to cooperate with the FHI, the solution of cases
is delayed and sometimes frustrated. He said, to the contrary, he
encouraged such cooperation, He explained that Negroes in many
areas are frustrated. He said he icels it is his duty to keep them
from expressing their frustrations through violence. Reverend King
made reference to ray report to you on the rioting that took place in
some of our northern cities last summer, He indicated he considers
it an excellent analysis of the situation.

Communist infiltration of the civil rights movement
was discussed. Reverend King stated that as a Christian he could
never accept communism and that he shared my concern with the
problem, He described communism as a "crippling, totalitarian
disease, * He said that while there are "one or two" former com-
munists currently engaged in fund-raising activities for the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, he does not tolerate communists in ad
his organization, He cited the communist background of Hunter Pitts q
O'Dell and noted that he considered the success of the Southern Christian :
Leadership Conference more important to him than his friendship with {

O'Dell. Consequently, he claimed, O'Dell is no longer associated
with his organization.

eee eee So



- The President

The preblems confronting the FEI in civil rights
gavestigations were explained te the Keverend King in detail, I
mace ii clear to him that cases deveioped as a resuli. of FSI
davestization must often be tried ia local courts where there are
aifficulties involved in getting white juries to convict white
defendants in connection with civil rights matters, : elted some of
‘our experiences in this regard.

He and his associates were advised of the recent
conferences held for local law enforcement officers throughout the
United states for the purpose of fully acqeainting thera with civil rights
legislation and their responsibilities in connection with same. Itold
him teat the results of this campaign have been encouraging in the
cooperation received.

I pointed out to him that there is a great misunderstanding
today among the general public and particularly the Negro race as to
the <iI's role in civil rights matters. i empkasizea that the FEIis an
investigative asency, that it cannot recommena prosecution or make
on-the-spot arrests where sederal laws have not been violated. He ‘
was advised that the FBI will not protect civil rights workers or :
Negroes because the FRE does not have the authority er jurisdiction :
to do so. He was also advised that the FBI cannot and will not
exceed its authority. Reverend Xing was told that our investigations
are conducted in a thorough and impartial manner, but if he or any of
bis associates knew of a fpecial Agent who had shown bias or prejudice,
Iwanted to know about it immeciately.

Reverend King indicated that the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference is planning io engage in veter registration
activities in Selma, Alabama, on or about January 1, 1965, and that
he has learned that there could be violence. Tteld him that our Agents
would be on the scene, not for the purpose of rendering protection,
but to observe and report to the Department of Justice any possible
violations of civil rights that may occur,

had contacted people in various parts of the United States to get them ‘to send telegrams
to the President, the Attorney General, and the FBI asking for Mr. Hoover's réetice-
-ment or resignation. I told Wilkins that King had also encouraged telegrams to be

sent advising the FBI of laxness in the investigation of civil rights matters. I asked
Wilkins how in the hell could he expect the FBI to believe his offers of friendship an¢
request for peace when King was at this time attempting to ruin us. Wilkins merel:
hung his head and stated he had no idea that King was carrying on such a campaign.
stated that this upset him greatly and made him all the more determined to initiate
action to remove King as soon as possible.

Wilkins stated that he had long noted King's sympathy toward the
\ communist movement. He told me this obviously stemmed irom Stanley Levinson's
influence on King. Wilkins diverted from the subject of the conversation to spend som?
time in explaining that he had also noted communist iniluence in the civil rights move-
ment in Mississippi. He stated that the cry of 'Down with tre Proletariat" was getting
to be the battlecry of the militant Negroes in Mississippi ana bama., He mentioned
the same thing was true with respect to Negro allegations of taxness on the part of the
| | FBI. He mentioned that the Negroes have been led by King ane
believe that the FBI could do nothing right; consequently, FEi
cases made little impression upon some Negroes in the civil r:

ts movement. .

Wilkins stated he was wrong in his criticism of the D.rector, He added
that he was attempting to accomplish, in a mild manner, a divi atween the battle
of the Director and iXing and any phases of the battle which wouic ct upon the civil

Directors, particularly since King is a member of this boara, He added, "We're
hurting, '' and something must be done.

Wilkins told me that he will be lecturisg in California r-ost all of next

SECURITY MATTER — COMMUNIST

At 1 p.m., 11/19/64, SAC Roney of our New Yorks Office
called to furnish information concerning a proposed reply A»
King will make te the Director's statement concerning him . oi Ff an
which appeared in the 11/19/64 issue of the “Washington Post; oA
lam
We learned from NY_4212-S* the foliowing conversation
which took place today between arry Wachtel and Bayard Rustin,
advisors to King. Wachtel said he had drafted something he felt
King (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) should release. Rustin asked
Wachtel if he thought King should make a statement and Wachtel
said he should. There is set forth as follows the text of the
proposed statement as drawn up by Wachtel.

"I have not seen the exact text of J. Edgar Hoover's
press interview in which, among other things, he attacked the
Warren Commission report and questioned my integrity. No
amount of name-calling or slanders can serve as a smoke screen,

oa _to hide the signal failure of the FBI to adequately perform Re

ts duties whether they relate to the events leading up-to 7

matters is that the Negroes in southern communities have :
<tearned from bitter experience that the FBI did not act in
these communities to protect them against brutality and
Wiolence, Just as no amount of snide comment can overcome th
criticism by the Warren Commission of the FBI's role--in the

tragic’ events of last November, neither can Mr, Hoover's
otitburst erase the dismal record of the FBI in the South on
brutality, bombings, murder and church bombings. The
distemper of Mr. Hoover does ;, however, esta CEO Ree

Memoratidum to W. C. Sullivan
From F, J. Baumgardner

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR
100-106670- :

i

“clearly to the American people and that is that he has
outlived his usefulness as the head of the FBI or as a
public servant. I am confident that this public display
of distemper will not go unnoticed by the President."

Rustin then replied to Wachtel that he liked the
statement with two exceptions, One is that Wachtel should drop
the part about King being resentful because King is not resentful.
Rustin said that the second thing he was against was the
conclusion, Rustin said King does not want to inject himself
or allow himself to be injected by this incident into something
involving the President, Wachtel then asked Rustin if he was
against both parts of the last statement, namely, the part
about Hoover having outlived his usefulness and the part about
the President noticing the distemper, Rustin said he was in
favor of taking both parts out. He said that instead they
could say "The question which now confronts us is whether a
person of such intemperance can any longer serve as a public
servant." Rustin said it is better to have this-in the form
of a question because it is strong and also because King is not
a person who says this person has to go, etc. Wachtel said he
agreed with the changes and said to Rustin that he had written
.the statement in anger. Wachtel said he would call Dora McDonald,
King's secretary, in Atlanta to let King know that we will be
together from 2 to 3 p.m. today and that he, King, should avoid
the press until he speaks to us. Rustin said all King shouid
say is that he will have a statement later on.

OBSERVATION:

As you know, Bayard Rustin has publicly admitted
having been associated with the communist movement in the
past. Harry Wachtel is not known to have been a Communist
Party member; however, there are indications he may also
have been associated with the communist movement in the
1940's and we presently are conducting investigation to
determine this. 7

Memorandum to W. C,. Sullivan
From F. J. Baumgardner

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
100-106670

The significant thing involved here is not that
these individuals have jumped quickly to King's defense,
but rather that they are seizing the opportunity, in line
with a long-held communist objective, to launch a campaign
to oust the Director as head of the FBI.

The important thing at this point is to follow
this matter closely to determine the degree to which King
follows their advice in regard to issuing the statement
prepared by Wachtel for we will then have further evidence
of the extent to which King is being used by communist
sympathizers in support of communist objectives.

For the time being, we should hold dissemination
of the information in abeyance until we see which way King
moves. Then we can put the whole picture together and make
appropriate dissemination.

ACTION:

I told SAC Roney to call our Atlanta Office and
advise them of this development. I told him to instruct the
Atlanta Office to be alert to any additional information which
may be developed through their sources and to keep the Bureau
advised expeditiously.

By telephone cails from our Atlanta Office 10:45 a.m, ‘
and 11:40 a.m., today (11-2-64), we learned of the following

information through a highly sensitive source, Martin Luther &
5

SUBJECT: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. ey
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

King, Jr., just learned this morning of a campaign which has 4
been initiated to encourage people to vote for King for presiden Bes ;
las a write-in candidate 11-3-64, The campaign is taking several 2
forms, including telegrams being sent to Negroes throughout the
country; efforts to gain radio time to urge people to vote for
King; and the circulation of handbills in larger cities encouragi:
a vote for King, The handbills reveal distribution by ,"'Committee
for Negroes in the Government," Louisville, Kentucky. (No record
organization Bufiles.)
According to our source, King interpreted the actions "
jdescribed above as an obvious attempt to cancel out the Negro
vote and to confuse Negroes in their voting, King believes
that the campaign was initiated by Goldwater forces because"
any votes for King by Negroes would obviously diminish the (
number of such votes for President Johnson,

reat renee tenes ne epee

King held an immediate press conference in Atlanta,
Georgia, this morning in which he told the press of the foregoing, ;
and denied having any connection with the campaign. He urged ~
people not to pay any attention to the efforts to have people

vote for him. a
ACTION: ee
bee ay

The foregoing information was immediately telephonically:
furnished to Mr. DeLoach's Office so that he might alert*the
White House. This is for your immediate attention, Letters to

King challenged the Director that if he had any real |

leaders of the Negro movement have tried consistently to Le. [

King quoted the AG against the Director, to the effect

MEMORANDUM TO MR. BELMONT FROM MR. W. C. SULLIVAN

‘Re: CP,USA; NEGRO QUESTION; :
- COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS; IS - C.

on this question last summer: "It is natural and inevitable
that communists have made efforts to infiltrate the civil
rights movement and to exploit the current racial situation.

In view of the real injustices that exist and the resentments
jagainst them, these efforts have been remarkably unsuccessful."

From my own experience in the civil rights movement, this
observation by the head of the Department of Justice is,
indeed, true and it should be paid heed by those who
periodically raise this issue. One may ask, why is this
dead issue being resurrected at tnis tine? why is tais
issue being used now to smear and attack the civil rights
movement and the SCLC. ‘ie in the SCLC adhere to our policy:
We do not accept in leadership or authoritative places or
‘taii levels : ce cf c ists

Co:

newspaper columnists or the head of the FBI himself -- to come
forward and provide real evidence which contradicts this stand i
of the SCLC. We are confident that this cannot be done.

We at the SCLC must be judged by our record. I stand fully
and forthrightly behind the action taken by myself in my 10
years of civil rights activity and of the SCLC which I have
been privileged to lead since its inception in 1957. No
action, no deeds, no statement requires repudiation as being
inconsistent with our struggle to achieve an America free

E challenge ali who raise the "red" issue, whether they be
E segregation through nonviolent persuasion and direct action.

put we will also serve notice that we will continue to
resolutely wage the struggle for the full emancipation of the
Negro. We will not allow ourselves to be diverted. We will
not allow Eastland, Barnett or the George Wallaces to use

the "red" issue to block our efforts, to split our ranks or
‘confuse our supporters. This resolution we make, ever

mindful that every effort is being made by the racists and the
Birchites to sow dissention and confusion to bring about the
defeat of the pending civil rights legislation.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITIEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC letter dated November 7,
1975, containing requests for materials concerning Martin
Luther King, Jz., and FBI memorandum dated November 17, 1975,
aay furnished a partial response to requests in referenced
iG letter.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
te the SSC of information and material to supplement that
previously furnished the SSC by referenced FBI memorandum in
response to Items 3 and 4 of SSC letter dated November 7, 1975.
fo explain why supplemental data is being submitted the
following is noted,

The SSG was previously furnished a Bureau memorandum
from M, A. Jones to Mr, DeLoach dated December 8, 1964, captioned
‘Martin Lather King, Jr., Possible Appearance Before Baptist
World Alliance Congress in June, 1965, Miami Beach, Florida.”
Page two, paragraph one of this memorandum indicated the
Director earlier, in a memorandum dated November 27, 1964,
disapproved a proposal for two representatives of the Baptist
World Alliance to “Listen to sources we have concerning this
(King) matter."

SSC letter dated November 7, 1975, Items 3 and 4,
requested this November 27, 1964, memorandum and all other
materials reflecting proposals, discussions, decisions or
accomplishments pertaining to permitting anyone outside the
FBI to “listen to sources” pertaining to King.

The only memorandum located in logical FBI Head- \
quarters files bearing the Nevember 27, 1964, date was a

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

November 27, 1964, FBI Headquarters, Washington, D. Cc."
{copy delivered with this memorandum.) Since this memor-
andum makes no references to "listen to sources," i.e.
playing tapes regarding King, it appeared this was not the
memorandum in question and the SSC was so advised in
referenced Bureau communication together with the fact the
desirad November 27, 1964, memorandum could not be located.

Subsequent to submission of referenced FBI memorandum
and during review of the personal files of W. C, Sullivan, a
memorandum from J. A. Sizoa to Mr. Sullivan dated December 1,
1964, captioned "Martin Luther King, Jv." was discovered. A
copy of this memorandum is being delivered with this memorandum,
and it is noted there is ne indication on this memorandum that
it was made part of an official FBI file. Paragraph one of
this memorandum refers to the DeLoach to Mohr memorandum of
November 27, 1964, concerning the interview of Roy Wilkias
and to an attached “informal memo" of Sullivan. As references
in the memorandum of December 1, 1964, to the “informal memo”
and the proposed playing of a King tape (paragraph four) are
erossed out, it is presumed that no tapes were actually played.
This is further substantiated by the M. A. Jones memorandum
of December 8, 1964, in which reference is made to the Director's
disapproval of a proposal to arrange for officials of the
Baptist World Alliance to listen to our sources. No copy of
the aforementioned "informal memo" was located in a search of
logical FBI files.

Therefore, with the exception of the above, FBIHQ |
personnel handling SSC requests for King material restate that,
to their knowledge, no other materials are believed to exist
in the King and related files which indicate proposals, dis-
cussions, decisions or accomplishments pertaining to permitting
anyone outside the FBI to "Listen to sources" pertaining to
King.

of his wife stating last night at a Thanksgiving dinner with friends, upon being asked

would jump to the defensive and defend King. On the other hand, however, many of the
white people who believe in the civil rights movement and who yearly contribute from
$500 to $50, 000 co this movement will immediately cease their financial support.
Wilkins added that the loss of financial support will be tremendous, however; the loss of
faith in King by millions of Americans would be even worse. He stated the combination |
of the two would, of course, halt any further progress of the civil rights movement,

Wilkins told me that he and a number of the Negro leaders had attempted |
several months ago to get King to accept the presidency of a small college. He stated |
King had refused to do'this because he was accustomed to the hypocrisy of udulation |
and to the money that was pouring into him. He stated that King for some time now has}
received from $500 to a $1,000 per speech on the decture circuit. He mentionedtat |
King receives considerable support from wealthy Negro and white people alike, He |

- ¥stated that obviously the best thing that the Negro leaders could do now would be to get |
fring to accept a position as Pastor of a large Negro church and thereby retire forever
as a leader of the Negroes.

eras Wilkins stressed the fact that he was not seeing me as an emissary.. He.
stated he had some influence on King but not much. He added that there were others
within his movement who had greater influence and that perhaps together some pressure
could be brought on King. Wilkins then added that he hoped that the FBI would not
expose King before something could be done.

I interrupted Wilkins at this point, I told him that the Director, of
course, did not have in mind the destruction of the civil rights movement’as a whole.
I told him the Director sympathized with the civil rights movement as exemplified by the
Director's supervision of the FBI's many brilliant accomplishments in this field. I
added, however, that we deeply and bitterly resented the lies and falsehoods told by
King and that if King wanted war we certainly would give it to him, Wilkins shook his
head and stated there was no doubt in his mind as to which side would lose if the FBI
really came out with all of its ammunition against King. I told him the ammunition
was plentiful and that while we were not responsible for the many rumors being initiated
against King, we had heard of these rumors and were certainly in a position to .
substantiate them.

I told Wilkins that inasmuch as he was attempting to hold out the feather
of peace he should know a few positive facts of life. He asked what I meant. I told
him my point was that he was attempting to prevent the FBI from exposing King, yet
certain highly-placed informants of ours had tipped us off to absolutely reliable infor-
mation that King had organized a bitter crusade.against the Director and the FBI. f
told Wilkins these long-standing and well placed informants had advised us that King

Re: Roy Wilkins, Appointment 11/27/64
FBI Headquarters, Washington, D. C.

| ‘had contacted people in various parts of the United States to get them to send telegrams
to the President, the Attorney General, and the FBI asking for Mr. Hoover's retire-
ment or resignation, I told Wilkins that King had aiso encouraged telegrams to be
sent advising the FBI of laxness in the investigation of civil rights matters. Iasked
Wilkins how in the hell could he expect the FBI to believe his offers of friendship and
request for peace when King was at this time attempting to ruin us. Wilkins merely
hung his head and stated he had no idea that King was carrying on such a campaign. He
stated that this upset him greatly and made him all the more determined to initiate
action to remove King as soon as possible,

Wilkins stated that he had long noted King's sympathy toward the
communist movement. He told me this obviously stemmed from Stanley Levinson's
influence on King. Wilkins diverted from the subject of the conversation to spend some
time i in explaining that he had also noted communist influence in the.civil rights move-

lw be the battlecry of the militant Negroes in:Mississippi and. Alaboma, He m
the same thing was true with respect to Negro allegations of laxness on ‘the part o:
FBI, He mentioned that the Negroes have been led by King and Bayard Rustin to
believe that the FBI could do nothing right; consequently, FBI solution of civil rights
cases made little impression upon some Negroes in the civil rights movement.

Wilkins stated he was wrong in his criticism of the Director. He added
| \that he was attempting to accomplish, in a mild manner, a division between the battle
of the Director and King and any phases of the-battle which would reflect apon the civil
| rights movement. He stated he has a hard time controlling his 32-man Board of
Directors, particularly since King is a member of this board, He then added, "We're
hurting, ' and something must be done.

Wilkins told me that he will be lecturing in California most all of next
week, He stated that before he leaves for the coast he will attempt to see King, along
with other Negro leaders, and tell King that he can"t possibly win in any battle with the
FBI and that the best thing for him to do is to retire from public life. He stated he
may not have any success in this regard, however, that he is convinced that the FBI
can easily ruin King overnight, therefore, for the good of the civil rights cause King
should make definite plans to leave public life and merely be Pastor of a Negro church
in the future. I told Wilkins this, of course, was up to him; however, I wanted to
reiterate once again most strongly, that if King wanted war we were prepared to give

disasterous, particularly to the Negro movement and that he hoped this would never
come about. I told him that the monkey was ou his back and that of the other_Negro
leaders, He stated he realized this. We then shook hands and he left to return to
New York.

the danger of King to the over-all civil rights movement. Wilkins
is already well aware of this. This group should include such
leadership as would be capable of removing King from the scene

if they, of their own volition, decided this was the thing to do
after such a briefing. The group sneuld include strong enough men
to control a man like James Farmer and make him see the light of

Re: SUPERSEDING REQUEST
FOR FBI MATERIALS

Reference is made to SSC letter to the Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Office of the
Deputy Attorney General, dated July 28, 1975, with
appendices attached thereto, requesting certain documents
and other information from the FBI; to the Attorney General's
Letter to the ssc dated duly 29, 1975; to memoranda
to the SSC dated dune 20, 1975, September 2, 1975, and
October 7, 1975, concerning other responses in the Joseph
Kraft matter; and to SSC letter to the Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney
General, dated November 7, 1975.

Pursuant to the request in the referenced SSC
letter dated November 7, 1975, for delivery of specified
serials in the Joseph Kraft file, we are delivering with
this memorandum Xeroxes of serials 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 21,
of FBI file 65~75629. Serial 1 of such file was also requested?
however, is not being furnished herewith since it neither
mentions Joseph Kraft nor does it have any apparent relation
to the Kraft matter. Its inclusion in the Kraft file appears
to have resulted from a clerical error in serialization.
Access to such serial will be afforded for purposes of verifi-
cation should the SSC staff so desire.

The remaining serials which were requested in fie
referenced November 7, 1975, SSC letter, have previously been’
sealed in accordance with the May 2, 1975, agreement between if

Joseph Kraft and the Attorney General. Such serials were ‘

Application has been made by the FRI to the :
Attorney General requesting that the Attorney General consider
approving FRI access to the sealed Kraft material in connection
with the tiovenber 7, 1975,request. The SSC will be advised
of further developments in this matter.

NOTE: SESRET

The subject of abéVve SSC inquiry, Joseph Kraft,
is the well-known newspaper columnist. A review of the
Kraft file reveals that the French Security Service, the
DST, conducted a microphone surveillance on Kraft's hotel
room for approximately one week during a 1969 visit by
Kraft to Paris. Such coverage was effected through the
urging of W. C. Sullivan, former FBI Assistant to the Director,
who traveled to France at such time, apparently at the direc-
tion of deceased FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Details
of the above coverage have appeared in the media apparently
as a result of leaks within the administration of former
President Nixon. Kraft himself testified in detail 5/10/74,
regarding this matter before the United States Senate Sub-—
committee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, the
Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on
the Judiciary, and the Subcommittee on Surveillance of the
Committee on Foreign Relations. We have previously responded
to earlier requests of the SSC in the memoranda of 6/20/75,
9/2/75, and 10/7/75, wherein we advised that no authorization
per se could be located for the 1969 electronic surveillance
of Kraft during a visit to France and provided the SSC with
access to selected serials which provided a summary of the
Kraft material.

spies

We previously reviewed the sealed portion of the
Kraft file under authority of the Attorney General, in
connection with our 9/2/75 response to the SSC; however,
the unsealed material was resealed following review. While
it may be possible to interpret the previous authority to
open the sealed portion of the file as an implied authority
to reopen it in connection with this request, it is felt
that the more judicious procedure is to secure a new authority
from the AG as requested within. Serial 1 referred to in the
memorandum to the SSC was a personal note from Legat, Paris,
to Mr. Hoover and concerns reported adulterous behavior on
the part of Nicole Salinger, wife of Pierre Salinger, the
former Press Secretary to President Kennedy. A copy of
the 11/7/75 SSC request is attached to the file copy of the
enclosed letterhead memorandum. Exact copies of the materials
being furnished are maintained in the office of the Senstudy 75
project. Arrangements have been made for a representative
of the Legal Counsel Division to deliver the attached memo-
randum as well as the materials being provided to the SSC.
This note has been classified “Secret" in order to protect
the confidentiality of our relationship with the French
Security Service, the disclosure of which could reasonably
be expected to result in serious damage to national security.

Mr. Hoover: WWE.

Instead of ee up your time giving you a vert
report, I will set out briefly the basic facts in this ne
relative to my European trip. :

First, I am sure you would want to know how very, very
willing and cooperative this high-ranking official was. The
moment I arrived I called for an appointment with him and was
given it inmediately. It was obvious he had to work me in before
others scheduled to see him because they were in. his outer office

ye when I went through. He was too gracious, however, to mention it,

ats & Second, I presented directly the request and predicated
we neat on my reason to believe that this person could be in contact
Ee with the Soviets and it was necessary to determine one way or

ce the other, Giving it this predication I thought would make our
ee position much more valid and secure. He told me they would do
it for us without any hesitation. Parenthetically, I might add
that such a cover is regarded as illegal: However, he made no
mention of this and they do it all the time. He pointed out that
if this man is living at a hotel or an apartment where complicated
switchboards are involved, there would be some technical problems.
I told him that I understood this. He assured me that if it is
technically possible to do it, it would be done and if it required
solving a problem,it would be solved if at all possible. Lin

7

Third, as it was necessary for this official to have
this man located, the situation analyzed, and the equipment put
in use, I decided not to stay for a day or so to get a sampling
of the product. If it could have been put on immediately, I would,
7 of course, have stayed around a day to see what it would be like.

Fourth, I instructed our Legat concerning the sensitivity
of this matter and made arrangements that the product can be so
. handled that the girls in his office will not know about it at all.
I also told him he was not, under any condition, to ever discuss
this with anyone back here at the Seat of Government. He is a
competent professional and can be relied upon in this matter.

Sixth, the high-ranking official with whom I dealt suggested

that we might want to give consideration at the end of this

operation to listening to the tape with one of his translators

to see if they had overlooked anything significant, which he

said could happen because they know nothing about this person's

background, contacts, etc. He said that if it were possible he

would send the tape over here but this is not possible because

they have an unbreakable rule that the tape can't be taken out of

this clandestine central headquarters where the work is done and

if it were removed, it would cause considerable wonderment and

speculation. However, he said he could safely and securely have

me enter a portion of this area to listen if I thought it necessary.

I told him this was a decision which could be faced after the

product was examined carefully and that then you ‘vould make the

decision,

Dear Mr. Hoover: enh Laat ioeneeecar ; Pica om

I heard from Legat Philcox this morning. In’
regard to the man in Paris in whom we are interested,
facts are these:

1), He registered at the hotel on June 29 and as
previously indicated plans to leave next Monday. He has
no regular assignment in Paris and comes and goes throughout
Europe. ;

2) Because of the hotel he is staying in and the
elaborate switchboard, it is not possible to put a telephone
surveillance on his room extension.

a A,
3) I told Philcox to push the French and see if Jhon
we could get a microphone in his room. This they are trying
to do. The question was raised as to whethor they should
take anyone at the hotel into confidence should it be necessary
in order to place the installation. I said no do not take
anyone into confidence at the hotel. a

I am folowing this matter very closely and you
will be kept advised.

Respectfully submitted,

Dear Mr. Hoover: Toseph factt |

This is to advise you that the French
have overcome some very difficult operational
problems and have installed a microphone in this
fellow's room. As I mentioned yesterday the
elaborate switchboard prevents using a telephone
surveillance.(S)

Just as soon as they get an adequate
product, it will be sent into me immediately and
I will handle the translation under very secure

You will kept promptly advised of

In regard to the sensitive coverage in
Paris, I have followed this throughout the week-~
end with our Legat. There is nothing direct we
can say on the telephone, but by double-talking
we can communicate. sj

The French were successful in installing
the microphone and they have the product, the Legat
o said, extending tc the time of this man's departure

this morning (s)

The tape is on its way to me and should

arrive tomorrow. I will have it immediately and st ve
very securely translated and the results given you. seh ay peé
The Legat was able to say one thing and that is Pore cl
that this person has been in touch with _the Soviets wt ari"

without waiver of any legal rights he may have as a result
of prior surveillances. As I advised you, we are working
now on general policy determinations which, we hope, will
offer a permanent solution to the problem this settles temp-
orarily. O£ course, under the terms of this agreement we
will notify you of any policy determination which would
involve a modification of this agreement.

Until a final policy is determined, this agreement should
assure Mr. Kraft that no person will read or otherwise use

these documents in any manner so long as they remain under
the seal arrangement.

Dear Mike:

By letter of July 28, 1975, the Senate Select:
Comittee requested delivery of "materials pertaining to
the reported investigation of columnist Joseph Kraft in
1969, other than the "logs' of any surveillance" (Part
TII-A).

On October 22, 1975, the SSC received a portion
of these materials. Numerous seriais the TBI file on
surveillance Kraft were not included in the materials
received, however, apparently because of a difference in
interpretation of the term "logs."' Request for delivery
is specifically made, therefore, for the following sérials
(with enclosures and attacaments) in FBI file 65-75629:
Serials #1, 2, 3, 6, 7, S, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. :

Excluded from this request are the logs of any.

A memorandum from A, B. Fulton to 7. R. Yannall, “Subject:
! Lloyd N. Cutler, Attorney for Josepa Kraft," dated June 10,
| 1975, which was provided to the SSC on October 22, 1975,

: notes that "the only transcripts of the overhears which were
located are contained:as an enclosure to 65-75629-16. Our |
request, therefore, does not encompass this enclosure.
Summaries of information obtained from any surve7ilance of

Epstein asked that the three types of operations be defined and
examples provided, ay)

Ryan described proprietary organizations as usually of oo

covert intelligence activities, Epstein was advised Ryan had no
knowledge of the use of proprietary organizations in comection with

the investigation of domestic subversive or extremist organizations
although it was possible such operations were used in our criminal

and foreign counterintelligence investigations, Epstein was advised
fictional organizational titles had been used infrequently for limited S
duration in connection with mailings utilized in the discontinued

intelligence~gathering purposes. In response to his specific question,
Epstein was advised Ryan was not aware of any current use of a
motional organization targeted against domestic extremists or sub+
versive organizations,

Epstein questioned regarding the use of notional Marxist
Leninist organizations, Ryan indicated this technique had been used-
in the foreign counterintelligence field in the past with some success,
but that he would not comment regarding the current use of notional
organizations in connection with our foreign counterintelligence
responsibilities. Epstein persisted in seeking this information and-
he was advised by Ryan if he desired further details, he should sube
mit his request in writing through proper channels, (I is noted we
currently have one notional organization operating with the objective
of uncovering Chinese communist political and intelligence thrusts
against this country),

Thereafter, Epstein and Banoff asked a number of
specific questions relating to the FBI's use of notional or fictitious
titles in connection with its security investigations and responses
were provided as noted in the attached,

Epstein indicated a specific interest in the use of a
notional organization in connection with the investigation of the
[tt Workers Party (SWP). He asked whether such techniques
ere used at the beginning of the interview, during the middle of the
interview, and at the interview's conclusion, In the first two instances,
he was advised Ryan had no knowledge of the use of this technique in
the SWP investigation, and in the instance of the third question Ryan
indicated it was repetitive, Ryan received the impression Epstein
was dissatisfied with the briefing.

FBI NOTIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The following comments were furnished to Senate Select
Committee staff members Mike Epstein and Barbara Banoff on
12/1/75 regarding specific areas of possible interest as relates to
notional organizations,

W. Es Bs DuBois Clubs

Tn July, 1964, the New York Office suggested establishing
a notional chapter of this organization which was in effect at the time
the youth group of the Communist Party, USA,- The suggestion of the
New York Office was furnished to other offices, two of which dise
agreed with the proposal, Review of our files has determined this
proposal was never effected,

Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

No information has been located indicating a notional organ=
ization with operating informants was ever formed or considered for
use in connection with the investigation of the SWP or other Trotskyite
organizations,

Committee for Expansion of Socialist Thought in America (CESTA)

In 1965 the CESTA operation was approved as an effort to
attack the Southern California District Communist-Party for its lack
of democracy and rigid interpretation of Marxism*Leninism utilizing
a Post Office box return address, A number of issues of the CESTA
publication "Socialist Dialogue" was mailed to local Communist Party

members, By late 1967 the operation had been terminated, Although

it is impossible to completely assess the results of this operation, —
suspicions and dissension was generated within the local Party dis»
trict, and in later months widespread defections in the Party were noted,

Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (CKKKK)

In 1967 an influential informaritin the United Klans of
America (UKA) became involved in a dispute with the UKA and subse
quently defected from the group, establishing the CKKKK, The field
suggested the CKKKK, through its informant+leader,: be directed to
cause dissension and defections in the UKA, The field also suggested
a second informant be directed to set up an anti+UKA "Citizens
Council' consisting of defected UKA members. FBIHQ refused to
authorize any monies to be paid to the informant to finance the CKKKK
or to authorize the second informant to establish an-anti- UKA "Citizens
Council," Our informant's activities in the CKKKK, until the organi+~
zation's demise in 3/70, contributed to the crippling of the UKA although
his efforts were not part of a notional organization directed by the FBL

Red Star Cadre (RSC)

Former FBI informant Joseph Burton was the prime
mover behind the RSC which had for its objective the development of
intelligence relating to CHICOM liaison with and influence of the
domestic Marxist«Leninist-Maoist movement, The RSC evolved from
the Red Star Swap Shop, an effort developed by Burton entirely on his
own, and continued generally from late 1972 until the summer of 1974,
Burton was unable to establish contact with significant foreign pro»
Maoist communists and he voluntarily ceased his duties in behalf of
the FBI when-he was-rejected-by the Revolutionary Union, the leading
domestic pro~Maoist“Marxist~Leninist organization,

o 26

AW 55012 DocId:32989601 Page 133



Red _ Collective

This title was utilized by two former New Orleans infor-
mants, Jill and Gi Schafex, during the approximate period 1972-73 to
support their widespread contacts with subversives and extremists.
No other informants participated and the use of the title was dis~
banded at the instructions of FBIHQ,

Antiwar or 'tPeace" Covers

The use of titles relating to the antiwar or peace effort
was considered in the late 1960's to assist our sources in developing
contacts abroad, One informant's association with the antiwar effort
was of assistance in establishing contact with a hostile foreign
communist government and valuable intelligence resulted, Other
sources utilized their actual or alleged association with antiwar or
peace groups to support their travel abroad to participate in inters
national conferences under the influence of communist elements or
to contact communist elements abroad, No formal antiwar or peace
group was formed by the FBlas a notional organization for intelli~
gence collection,

News Media Covers

An informant who was active with a domestic newspaper
supporting a foreign hostile communist country and a photographer
who had broad association with domestic extremists were considered
in connection with the establishment of-possible notional organizations
to be targeted against foreign communist elements, These efforts
never came to f¢tition,

Be

HW 55012 DocId:32969601 Page 134



National Committee for Domestic Tranquility

In the mid«1960's, the above title and a Post Office box
was utilized-for several anonymous mailings to Ku Klux Klan organi»
-zations, The newsletters urged Kian members to desist from violence
and renounce their affiliation based upon patriotic, religious and moral
motives, No informants were included in the operation,

Miscellaneous

No significant notional organizations targeting domestic
extremist groups were developed in the New Left area, including the
Students for a Democratic Society, or relating to militant black
extremists such as the Black Panther Party.
