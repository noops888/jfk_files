(00: Miami)

On December 2, 1959, Captain LEE NAPIER of the

Miami, Florida Police Department advised SA J. C. STRICKLAND,

JR. that an informant has reported information concerning

the contemplated kidnaping of PEDRO DIAL LANZ, former head

of the Cuban Air Force, who is presently residing in Miami,

Florida.

According to NAPIER, his informant was recently

in Havana, Cuba and was approached by Cuban officials con-

cerning the possibility of getting LANZ to Cuba.

The

informant is alleged to have related that he would not get

involved,

but informed the

Cuban officials he knew a person

who would be interested and who could possibly accomplish

the mission. Informant advised a representative from Cuba

is scheduled to arrive in Miami on December 4, 1959, to

further discuss this matter.

NAPIER advised his informant is TOM McCRORY,

Marine Broker, Miami, Florida.

TOM McCRORY, whose name should not be disclosed,

was interviewed December 3, 1959.

He advised that about two

weeks ago he was in Havana, Cuba discussing business matters

with JOSE SALAZAR of the Tourist Bureau.: He has known SALAZAR

for quite some time and SALAZAR introduced him to a Lieutenant

DELGADO who is second in command of construction at the Navy

Yard, Havana, Cuba. SALAZAR and DELGADO mentioned to him

the possibility of getting DIAZ LANZ out of the United States

into Cuba. McCRORY told them he would have nothing to do

with such

a matter but thought it could be done upon pay-

ment of a sufficient sum of money and that he knows a person

i do not out d

who would be interested; he would put them in contact with

this individual. The individual referred to is JACK BROWN,

whose identity should not be disclosed, who is a deep sea

diver and operates an advertising business in Marathon,

Florida. BROWN owns a sea plane and a PT boat.

FLAt

McCRORY advised he discussed the matter with

JACK BROWN and it was agreed between them that no effort

would be made to contact LANZ, but that an effort would be

made to have the Cuban government pay a large sum of money

in advance upon the belief that BROWN would undertake the

job.

He advised that under no circumstances should

BROWN be informed that the matter has been reported, as

BROWN then probably would not endeavor to determine

the

complete plan from the Cuban officials. McCRORY related

he can control BROWN and, if necessary, he believes he

could induce BROWN to testify.

On December 2, 1959, McGRORY and BROWN had a FL

telephonic conversation with JOSE) SALAZAR and an agreement CUBA

was made whereby a representative

would arrive at Key West,

Florida, on the first Cubana plane on the morning of Decem-

ber 4, 1959... BROWN was to meet the Cuban representative in

the airport manager's office, which upon reflection McCRORY

believed to 'be not feasible as BROWN is well known to the

airport manager.

MCCRORY called SALAZAR on December 3, 1959, and

outlined the danger of having such a meeting in Key West,

and suggested the representative come to Miami. This change

in plan met with the approval of SALAZAR who instructed

McCRORY to make all arrangements. SALAZAR advised he could

not furnish the name of the person who would arrive in

Miami but the individual would have the physical description

of McCRORY.

Two adjoining rooms were obtained at the Skyway

Motel a short distance

from the International Airport, Miami,

Florida. McCRORY met the first Cubana plane which arrived

at 8:50 A.M. on December 4, 1959. No contact was had by

anyone with McCRORY.

McCRORY thereafter called SALAZAR who advised

he would determine the reason for the delay. SALAZAR then

. called McCRORY back at his residence and stated the person

who was to arrive in Miami had some visa trouble and efforts

were being made to clear this person for a later flight.

SALAZAR requested McCRORY to call

again at 1:00

P.M. McCRORY called SALAZAR at this time and was advised by

SALAZAR's secretary that SALAZAR would call McCRORY at about

5:00 P.M.

At 4:00 P.M. SALAZAR called McCRORY's residence

and

in MCCRORY's absence left a message that the individual

was leaving Havana, Cuba on Cubana airlines at 5:00 P.M.;

he would be wearing a grey jacket and red shirt with Indian

design.

The plane arrived shortly after 6:00 P.M. and •

McCRORY was contacted by an individual who was dressed as

mentioned above. McCRORY took this individual to the Skyway

Motel, room 258. McCRORY contacted BROWN and arrangements

were made for BROWN to meet with them at the motel at about

10:30 P.M.

McCRORY advised that while in the hotel room prior

to the arrival of JACK BROWN, the Cuban related that his name

was AUGUSTINE WALDO YASELLS.

His passport carried the name

AUGUSTINE W. YASELLS: He claimed to be from Santiago,

Cuba, 20 years of age, a First Lieutenant in the Army, G-2.

YASELLS stated he had been

active in the Cuban revolution

and his superior was Major FuRRY, nineteen years of age. Lets

He also mentioned that his instructions to come to Miami. APROX 1946

were given to him by Lieutenant PINO of the Cuban Navy, and

Major FURRY.

YASELLS also advised he had previously entered

the United States on October 5, 1957, when he enrolled in

ROTC training at Georgia Military College, and later

mentioned his training was obtained at the University of

Georgia. He also mentioned Georgia Tech.

McCRORY took YASELLS to dinner, during which

time YASELLS related he was instructed to stay with BROWN

until the mission was accomplished. He claimed the Cuban

government desires that BROWN endeavor to induce LANZ to

return to Cuba by plane and BROWN should follow in his own

plane and radio the position of LANZ and the place where he

would land. McCRORY told YASELLS, BROWN would have his own

plan and at the present time it is very difficult to leave

any airport for Cuba.

McCRORY met BROWN at the bus station at 10:30

P.M. and returned to the Skyway Motel. YASELLS remained in

the room during the absence of McCRORY.

BROWN informed YASELLS that SALAZAR had stated

the representative from Cuba would have in his possession.

a business card of SALAZAR. YASELLS could not produce such

a card and McCRORY persuaded BROWN that YASELLS was no doubt

the person sent to contact BROWN as SALAZAR had previously

furnished the type clothing YASELLS would be wearing.

McCRORY advised YASELLS claimed he understood

the demands of BROWN and they insisted YASELLS return to

Havana and report to his superior and later contact McCRORY

if they agreed to the request of BROWN.

YASELLS departed Miami at 9:50 A.M., December 5,

1959, aboard Cubana airlines.

McCRORY advised that while en route to the air-

port YASELLS remarked that BROWN is money crazy.

McCRORY called SALAZAR December 5, 1959, and in-

formed him YASELLS was returning to Cuba in possession of

the demands of BROWN.

He told SALAZAR he had previously

mentioned that the mission would cost a large sum of money

and BROWN was rather reluctant to discuss any plan with

YASELLS as YASELLS had no authority. SALAZAR advised he

would look into the matter further and contact McCRORY.

He also advised he has

persuaded BROWN it would

be foolish for him to go to Cuba, and BROWN-agrees that

any agreement made should be undertaken in the United States.
