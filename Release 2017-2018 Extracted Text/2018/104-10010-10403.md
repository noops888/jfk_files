Australia (IN 67327, Top Secret, later downgraded to Secret),
reporting a telephone conversation the previous day with on
anonymous individual who had described himself sa a Polish
chauffeur for the Coviet Embassy in that city. Thie individual,
while discussing several matters of intelligence interest, touched
on the possibility that the Soviet Government had financed the
agsascination of President Kennedy, Reference was made in this

4, Tha CIA Station in Canberra arranged for discussion of the
calls In the opinion of the
Australian authorities, the caller was a crank. In any event, they
ware sot eble to identity any Polish eraployes of the Goviet Embassy,
the automcbila deceribed by the calles as the ona ke drove, or tha
Ucenss plate number given by hima. No furthar information on this

the ciller was sorne type of crank. This conclusion, however, cannot
be confirmed.
