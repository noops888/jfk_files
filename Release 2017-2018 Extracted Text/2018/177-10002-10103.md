a.

Vietnamese Communist ef-

forts to discredit the new Saigon

regime stayed in high gear this

week.

The number of armed attacks

was off from the high of the previous

week but still some 50% above the

year's weekly average.

c. These attacks have been,

for the most part, small-scale efforts

directed against the government's

paramilitary forces in the villages.

They have been designed more for

their psychological impact than for

immediate military gain.

e. The new government 'is re-

sponding by stepping up its own

military operations.

It is also

setting about the hard job of re-

vamping the Diem government apparatus

and harnessing broader popular sup-

sort for the war effort.

f. The generals have been

dealing fairly effectively with

their new responsibilities.

There

are, however, a few signs of dissen

sion within this group and between

it and civilian politicians.

The new regime has also

embarked on a purge of high military

officers who sided with Diem during

the Buddhist crisis and failed to

get on the right side soon enough.

The death toll from the

terrorist outburst in Caracas last

Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at

about 30.

b. This is the high water mark

thus far in the campaign of the

Castro-supported Communist extremists

to disrupt the national elections a

C. The Betancourt government

has struck back hard.

Its new uni-

fied command over the security forces,

passed this

Initlal test with flying colors.

d. At least 500 extremists

were arrested and the round-up is

still going on.

Their removal will

hamper the Communist drive against

elections in major cities like Caracas.

We now expect the elections

to be held on schedule, a consider-

able achievement under

the circum-

stances.

The elections will be fol-

lowed, however, by a Communist ef-

fort to prevent the

March inaugura-

tion of the victor.

f. The rub here is that none

of the presidential candidates com-

mands President Betancourt's con-

siderable assets for dealing success-

fully with the harsh realities of

Venezuelan politics. The constitu-

tion prevents Betancourt from suc-

ceeding himself.

USSR-Cuba

Cuban interpreters are now

posted at several surface-to-air

mis-

sile (SAM) sites on the island.

We think this means that

on-site training of Cubans has begun

on schedule.

Field training is to

last six months, after which the

SAM system may be turned over to

Castro.

In the past month some

of these vete probably sal eperts,

sent to monitor the training.

All Soviet weapons intro-

The only significant excep-

tion is the SAM svstem.

c. Moscow has tried on a num-

ber of past occasions to assert its

right to restrict Allied use of the

air corridors.

In early 1962, the

Soviets attempted to'reserve "blocks"

Iraq-Syria-

UAR

This sort of harassment

stopped in the spring of 1962 when

Soviet leaders became convinced

that the US was interested in a

serious discussion of a Berlin settle-

ment.

Moscow may hope that the

threat of more of this sort of har-

assment will jog the US into talks

on Berlin.

It now appears that Presi-

dent Arif's role in last Monday's

coup in Baghdad may have been vir-

tually that of a bystander.

c. Whatever Arif's role may

have been, the coup was primarily

by the Iraq. Army to cur

wing of the Baath Party. The Baath

is an Arab nationalist political or-

The coup group has not

thrown all Baathists out of the

government; there are party members

in the new cabinet.

e. Syrian Baathists have wel-

comed this retention of their Iragi

brothers.

Their attitude springs

from the recognition that the Baath

in Syria cannot stay afloat without

support from Irad.

f. The reaction of Nasir's

Egypt, which passionately desires

to see the Baath go under, has beer

exactly the opposite. Cairo has beer

backing off its all-out support for

the coup ever since the new cabinet

was announced.
