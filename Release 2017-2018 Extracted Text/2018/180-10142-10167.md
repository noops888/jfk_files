VII. Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico

A. Introduction

THIS COPY IS NOT

FOR RELEASE.

After the Warren Commission investigation published

its

report two very important allegations related to Lee

Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City have come to

the attention of the United States investigative agencies.

In 1964, Elena Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee

Harvey Oswald, accompanied by two other men, at a party

at the home of Ruben Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of

Silvia Duran.

The Garro and Contreras allegations, in conjunction

would tend to indicate that Oswald, or someone

impersonating him, visited the Cuban Consulate at least

one and possibly two additional times on September 27,

1963. Silvia Duran says that Oswald first visited the

Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final de-

1083

stination. (Duran intervier, 6/6/78, JrK Document 4011681.)

Ms. Duran sent Oswald to obtain photographs that he needed

1084

for the visa application. (Fid., p, 20-23.) Eusebio

Azcue recalls that this visit probably occured on the

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in Mexico City?

When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey

Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

-BY Saturday, September 28, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald

had failed to obtain visas at both the Cuban/and

Soviet Embassies.

From sunday, September 29,

through Wednesday morning, October 2, when he

left Mexico City on a bus bound for the United

States, Oswald spent considerable time making

his travel arrangements, sightseeing and checking

again with the Soviet Embassy to learn whether

anything had happened on his visa application. "3!

(Warren Conmiscion Report, p. 30%.) Subsequent to the Warren

Commission's Report, the allegations of Elena Garro (See Seetion

VI, C, above.) and Oscar Contreras Lartigue

1133

(see Section vI,

1, above:) came to the attention of the United States inves-

tigative agencies. The main allegation of both these people,

that they met Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City, remains to this

most of this time sightseeing and making travel arrangements.

(Warren Report, p. 301+ It is entirely possible that Oswald !

did spend some of his time during this weekend sightseeing

and making his travel arrangements. It is also entirely

possible that, after his failure to obtain his visas on

Saturday, September 28, that Oswald did not give up completely

and did attend a party where he would have come into contact

with the Cuban Consular officials and, later, sought help

from pro-castro students.

It is entirely possible that Ruben Duran had a "twist

party"

on September 30, or October 1

as Elena Garro has claimed.

Ruben, Horacio, Lydia and Silvia Duran all admitted that they

1139)

frequently had twist parties in 1963.

It should be noted that this party alle

alleged by Elena Garro:

•) The Committee has not

been able to verify whether or not gaurds were posted out-

side of Elena's home in 1963 as she claims.

But other details of Elena's story make it hard to

outer out be nant. Perhaps the most striking is the sugges-

tion that Oswald's relationship with Silvia Duran was more

extensive than just the business contacts in the Cuban

Consulate.

Another detail is the manner in which i elena's

allegations were handled, and the manner in which this

Committee's attempts to investigate those allegations have

147

been frustrated.

In 1965 Elena Garro reported that Silvia Duran

148N

had been Oswald's mistress while he was in Mexico City.

In 1967 this report was confirmed by a CIA agent who talked

to Silvia Duran.

The CIA Station did not consider the

information significant and told the agent to end his

contact with Ms. Duran Visu

(see section VI, A, 2, above

that

for details.) If that information is accurate then Silvia

inviting Oswald to a party would not have been that surprising.

Silvia Duran admitted that the Mexican police had questioned

her on this point but denied that she had had an affair

11151

with Oswald. / Ms. Duran denied having any extra-marital

1157

affairs while she was married to Horacio Duran.

There is also circumstantial corroboration of Ms.

Garro's allegation's regarding tune Cobb sharp. (For example,

Ms. Cobb was indeed a CIA agent and she did file the first

1464

report of Ms. Garro's story. It should be noted that this

first report was accurate in its detail)in that Ma. Garro's

story remained

essentially the same in subsequent repetitions.

1865

Ms. Garro claimed that she kicked Ms. Cobb out of her house.

There is a notation on Ms. Cobb's report that she was not

able to regain access to Ms. Garro. The Committee attempted

to obtain an interview with Ms. Cobb, but was once again

frustrated. '"*7

Reviewing the manner in which the CIA Mexico City

Station and the Legál Attache's office in Mexico City

handled Ms. Garro's allegations reveals that, at best,

they were handled in an irresponsible manner because they

were dismissed after a superficial investigation. The first

1168

report that came to the CIA was mis-filed and forgotten.

The Legat, after talking to Elena, dismissed her story after

interviewing one person whom she said may have been at the

1169

party.

The manner in which the official American Community

handled Charles Thomas' reporting is detailed in Section

VI, C, 11, above.) Mr. Thomas Speculated in 1969 about

why Ms. Garro's story had been largely ignored by the

American official's in Mexico:

It would appear that whereas the FBI has

Ilscounted the Elena Garro allegations.

the CIA is still considerably disturbed

by them.

further investigation, however, for a number

of reasons: l) considering the sensitive over-

lap and subtle competition between two intelli-

the FBI's clear jurisdiction; 2) there are ob-

vious complications in conducting such an inves-

tigation in a foreign country; 3) there is a close

stances it is unlikely that any further investi-

it is ordered by a high official in Washington. 17°

attempted

The Committee's last hope was to locate Elena Garro.

Although the Committee established telephonic contact with

(1111)

Ms. Garro, it was never able to arrange an interview.

Consequently, the Committee was totally frustrated in

this aspect of it's investigation but yet believes that

there is a song possibility that lee Harvey Oswald did

attend a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran.

The Committee also considers it possible that Lee

Harvey Oswald contacted pro-Castro students at the National

Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional

Autonoma de Mexico, heréinafter UNAM.) as claimed by Oscar

1172

Contreras Lartigue.

(See section VI, D, above for details.)

Silvia Duran admitted that she had told Oswald of two ways

in which he could get a Cuban visa: 1) he could get an intran-

sit visa by first obtaining a visa to another Communist ..

country such as Russia; 2) he could obtain a regular Cuban

visa by knowing someone in Cuba who would, after a fashion,

vouch for him.

Contreras says that Oswald first contacted him as he was

leaving a round-table discussion at the school of philosophy.

1874

It Is known that, in 1963, the Duran"

's were close friends

with the Chairman of the Philosophy Department at UNAM,

Ricardo Guerra, who held seminars on Kant, Hegel and Marx

in the Duran*s home.

1115

It is possible, if Silvia Duran had

more than just a purely business relationship with Oswald,

that she referred Oswald to one of Guerra's Marxist seminars

in his search for help. Unfortunately, Contreras does not

name who headed the round table discussion at which he met

MIL

Oswald.

Silvia Duran denied that she referred Oswald to

anyone for help.

Mexican Ambassador to East Germany and was not available
