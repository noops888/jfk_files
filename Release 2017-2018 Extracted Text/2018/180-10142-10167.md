VII. Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico

, c# THIS COPY IS NOT
‘A. Introduction FOR RELEASE.

After the Warren Commission iavestigatien published

its report two very important allegations related to Lee
Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City pave-come to
the attention of the United States investigative agencies.
In 1964, Elena Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee
Harvey Oswald, accompanied by two other men, at a party
at the home of Ruben Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of
Silvia Duran.’ (see-sectiomnn~e. ) In 1967, Oscar Con-

treras Lartigue reported that he met Lee Harvey Oswald on

i . feel
the campus of the National Autonomous University cf Mexico.

In addition, the testimony of the Warren Commission's

primary witness related to Mexico City, Silvia Tirado Duran,

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in Mexico City?
When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey
Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

Va -By Saturday, September 28, 1963, Lee Harvey Ofwald
had failed to obtain visas at both the Cuban/and
Soviet Embassies. From Sunday, September 29,
through Wednesday morning, October 2, when he
left Mexico City on a bus bound for the United
States, Oswald spent considerable time making
his travel arrangements, sightseeing and checking
again with the Soviet Embassy to learn whether .
anything had happened on his visa application. '!3!

Warren—Commicsion—Repert;—pr—-364.) Subsequent to the Warren
uae
Commission's Report, the allegations bf Elena Garro (See~Seetton
13d
Wi;-T, above: ) and Oscar Contreras Lartigue (See-Seetien-VI,

I—abeve:) came to the attention of the United States inves-
tigative agencies. The main allegation of both these people,

that they met Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City, remains to this

day without direct corroboration. Yet the Committee feels that

from pro-Castro students.

Ms. Cobb was indeed a CIA agent and she did file fhe first

of reasons: 1) considering the sensitive over-

Contreras Lartigue. (See—Section—Vi,—b;—ebeve—for-deterls.)

Silvia Duran admitted that she had told Oswald of two ways

in which he could get a Cuban visa: 1) he could get an intran-

country such as Russia; 2) he could obtain a regular Cuban
visa by knowing someone in Cuba who would, aftex—a—fashion,

that she referred Oswald to one of Guerra's Marxist seminars
