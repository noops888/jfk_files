NY 92-2988

on February 16, March 25, and April 23, ae
efforts were made to contact SALVATORE D'EORIO by
SA. SULLIVAN.

Each, of these ‘attempted contacts were made at
the Wagon Wheel Diner, 48th Avenue and Van Dam Street,
. Long Island. City, New York. This is the, location where
D'EORIO. has operated a "Shape"-and from which a prior

contact was made in the past. :

7 D'EORIO was not observed on any of these occasions
although. it was apparent that. the "shape" is still being
operated from ‘this’ diner.

NY T-1, contacted on December 30, 1964, advised
that the recent election of new officials for Local 707;
International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) has resulted
in the. placing of ‘men’loyal to ANTHONY (TONY PRO) PROVENZANO
in. control of this Local. . Informant advised that LOUIS
ALIMENA, the new president, is strictly a "TONY PRO man"
and in the informant's opinion there will be trouble
ahead a5 a result of PROVENZANO'S influence.

aaaet : Informant. advised ‘that LEO SCHWARTZ, Recording
Secretary, and FRANK CONNOLLY, Secretary-Treasurer,
are the only new officers with whom he is acquainted.

NY ‘T-1 was again contacted on April: 20, 1965, -
and he cayanea that since the death of CONNIE NOONAN,
consideration has been given to organizing:

DocId: 32316482... Page 6


“NY 92-2988

phony deals, for at least the present. Informant stated
that CONNOLLY is the only one really, qualified to operate
the union, due to his pst experience. It is CONNOLLY's
opportunity to make himself a big man if he operates. the
union wisely and with "guts" in standing up to any mers:
who try to push him, :

Seeeeer Informant felt that CONNOLLY started out. wrong
being connected in.any. way with PROVENZANO, but now ~
that he is in,he could wholly disassociate himself from
PROVENZANO and get on his own,which would unite the
union behind him (CONNOLLY).

: NY T-2 again contacted on February 18, 1965,
advised that Mrs.” (FNU) GANNON is now.the clerk at
Local 707, having replaced EDDIE TOMIZEK, TOMIZEK is
apparently going to work in the office of Local 807,
IBT, which is in-the.same building.

. - Informant, further advised that GANNON was
formerly the private secretary of ‘TOM HICKEY (now deceased),
former president of Local 807, IBT,. Upon HICKEY's death
GANNON became the. secretary to JOHN STRONG, who became
_the new president ‘of Local 807 after the death of HICKEY,
Informant further advised that GANNON later went with
Local 707 for several years but left and-has been absent
from the labor scene for sevewl years. Informant felt
that GANNON will be a valuable asset to Local 707 with
her knowledge of union affairs.

7 i Informant stated that there have been a lot of
guys who look like “hoods" at the office of Local 707
since the new officials assumed office. Informant did
not have any specific names but was only commenting on
the looks of the individuals.

Informant further stated that. things are quiet
in the office of Local 707 and FRANK CONNOLLY, new ~.
Secretary-Treasurer, appears to be playing a lesser role
than previously anticipated. The new president, LOUIS
ALIMENA appears to be a strong man in the front for all
activities, at least in the first months of his new
position. : : acueugeeee
