the wall of the adjacent apartment in which Miss Stacey lived, In
November 1959, the FE Division sent one case officer and one TSD
technician to Havana, and the installation of a microphone and tape
recorder was completed in Miss Stacey's apartment on 29 November
1959.

to have been maltreated.

8, Accor ding to z articles in the Cuban papers the three -- Poltet

10. The three technicians traveled to “Cuba as tourists. under.
very light commercial cover, two.of them working foz a-company in’ -« -
New York and the third, one in Baltimore. In each case the covar2- > ~
company consists of a telephone answering service and a name on the

as well as unbackstopped home addresses for use when entering or.

requires this information, Subsequent to their detention the home™~ -
addresses have been partially backstopped so that ingviries will
indicate that someone with this alias rame had lived in the apartment

efforts are being made to provide a backstop to withstand inquiries
from the press should the Cubans reveal this information, In view

of the thinness of the cover, it is uncertain whether this will succeed. .
