his relationship with Iden B sometime within the next few months.

The marriage wiil probably take place in Latin America and Iden

B will make her home there to avoid a public scandal which would

have a harmful effect on the ANYUl organization.

Attention is

called to paragraphs 14, 17, and 26 which answer, in part, some of

the questions raised in ref dispatch concerning ODYOKE Involvement

IE ANWORLD.

The Station has forwarded reports of this nature

which concern claims by members of the Cuban exile community of

KUBARK sponsorshiv of AMBIDDY/l. Of the specifics cited by the

Cuban, Intelligent or otherwise, to support their allegations

those

statements attribused to

the AMWORLD principals thomselves

as oppesed to conviction based on AMTORLD's affluence..

no tangible evidence of KUBARK Involvement with ANORLD has come

to our attention.

Iden B and source that he was going to receive &

cöurse under PEPRIME direction.

AMBIDDY/l used to leave every

day at € All and come back at night.

According to source, the

course lasted 6 weeks and most of the times Iden B used to drive

AMBIDDY/1 in an automobile to a place in Coral Gables where the

course was being given.

Every time ANBIDDY/1 returned from the

classes he talked about the things he had learned and talked

about secret writing, codes, of

some pens with a substance which

could kill instantaneously, shout sabotage methods, etc., etc.

number of issues terminating with the statements to the effect

that he was the only one to liberate Cuba,

he was the only one to

run it later, and that there would be no

voting and no elections.

MARIN objocted, stating that he had joined a revolutionary group,

not a dictatorship), and along with other

trainees requested to

No - Everyone knows when vars begin, but never when they end.

lo - You personally and the M.R.R. in teneral have almaya been

lo ~ Sono International circles claim that russia le abandon-

Ing Castro, that it has egreed on this abandonent secretly

with North Arerion, and that this 1s visibly evident in the

gradual withdrawel of Soviet troops from the island. They add

that confidence in this agreement has caused North Aerica to

"tolerate" this freah outbreak of armed activities in the Car-

Ibbean. Do you share this view?

Ao - Frankly I do not belleve in international pacts that are

not

olear to ne, and I bellove much less in the willingness of

Fussia to CarTy out its agrechants: poland, Chechoslovakia

and Hungary are historical witnesser of Russian treachery.

As for tolerating our aotivities", I cannot speais,

because we have not asked for "toleranoer for them. It never

occurred to me to "ask rermission" to die for my country..

Co: - Would you subordinate the possibilities of liberation

of your country to any advantage of an international nature

for the United States?

nation. Any Ouban who does not belleve that does not deserve

to be onlled a Cuban.

believed that all hope of liberation had expired. Can you foll

us sonething about the internal strugile against corunisa?

i'As - To thirt that all hope of liberation has espired in Cuba

1s to show a complete lack of knowledge of the condition and

charaoter of the Cuban people. The history of Cuba is a his-

tory of repeated martyrdon in search of real liberty.

I can say very little about the Internal strugsle that

does not affeot its security. But let 1t be surfioient to say

that today there are guerrillas in five of the six provinces

of Cuba; that the tyrant knows about them and that he has not

been able to wipe them out because of the peasants support

for then; that in the oities the sentiment of the workers has

begun to be mobilized toward passive resistance, and that

were seeing it. (I do not think it was a secret to anyone where

the weapons we used in the invasion came fron.) I had no soru-

After leaving prison I lost conildence in that assistance

Decause since then not only bave I seen none, but also I have

Land and'franoe deserve, who, turnins their baoks on prinolples

they olaim to hold and on morel and humane considerations, take

part in propping up castro's bloody regime by supplying him

with credits and all kinds of financial baoking?

SUMMARY

Jo The Case Officer confirmad that A-l had definitely dreided

not to attempt Operation Genasis and will mount Operation Zenon

instead. The undersigned agreed that this was a wise decision

sInce the latest reports indicated increasing hostile naval

activity in the area, making chances for survival extremely

light, and reminded A-1 of His recent speech in which he stated

that AWORLD propaganda was in support of military operations and

not the reverse, hinting thai AMBANG would sacrifice his men

for the sake of publicity fay himselt. A military opération, even

1f 1t failed completely woujd not be as harmful as an obvious?

publicity stunt that cost lives and equipment. Al appeared to

accept the necessity for postponing Genesis but was obviously

disappointed at not being able to Jand his sharpahooter to rake

a shot at the guest of hongp during the military review.

2o An and Al vere siven the sequence of l signa to be cranemitted

during the test run of the signal plan to be used during the op.

will come from one of his bases, and to make certain that the captain:

The remainder will follow by Dispasch.

T. Guertier suggeted Curaçao as a suitable place for drydocking

Adelaida for needed repairs after

the operation.

A-l demurred,

stating that it would be needed

for an infiltration op on 1 May.

A-19 was told that it was of the utmost importance that the All

Dolores be provided with a top

quality captain and engineer.

regardless of cost: or nationality,

that the equipment.was

very

sensitive and was irreplacable. A-19 stated that it would be a

problem, especially the engineer, but that he would do so. Gertler

offered

no suggestions whire to look, merely commenting that not

that AMWORLD had made many commercial contacts he should be asia.

to obtain assistance in locating, a good man for the job.

• The complete crew for the Dolores has not been signed yet. Some

of the crew fron the Adelaida can fill in while she is in drydoch.

A-lowas told that the Consejo was negor ating for Standard 011

of New Jersey to provide AMWORLD will its rudl on a regular basie

and that the company wur.ted a letter from some prominent Nicariuan

The following was relayed to AlBIDDY-l:

"We are

glad you have second thoughts

about Playa Giron. We have

received more Information about military, epecially maritime,

build up in that sector which would make any landing attempt

virtually suicidal."

AMJAVA-4 and AMYUN19 and give us his final decision as to

whether or not this operation would be run...' AMBIDDI-1 commented

that one life meant more to him than the entire operation.

How

of the Cuban people.

The undersigned replied that there are

two widen to the coin; should their operation fall, this would

play into the hands of Castro, and it was the opinion of this

Headquarters Comment'-time Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de

The following is a résumé of the political

Recuperacion Rovolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary

Recovory) as prepared by Source.

It is based on statements

made by Artime in his speech on 18 March 196l to the Associación

para Recuperación Económica de Cuba (AREC, Association for

Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled

Comunismo por qué? (Communism "or what?), which was written

nine

months belore Castro came

to power, and on Artime's book

Traición (Betrayal).

Artime does not believe in political extremes - neither the

left nor the right.

He believes that extremes always end by

touching one another.

If any extreme gains pover in Cuba,

and in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship,

ho "ill continue to fight with weapons in hand.

Artime does

not belleve in the classification of men by race, by political

ranks In former governments, or by money.

le confesses to being

an opportuniat in the sense

that he 1s taking maximum advantage

of each opportunity,

but not in the sense of changing his

bellets in anord with opportunities.

The main theme of Cominismo por qué? was that more than a change

In government a change

in the conscience of men is needed.

It

outlined the duties of the padron (landowner) toward the workerg

so that the latter may live in dignity and honor.

The padron

should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems.

The worker, in turn, has certain obligations

to the padron.

because Castro had not been honest with the

businesses by

not telling then their property would be confiscated.

3.

The following excerpts from Artime's book Traicion clearly

outline Artine's ideology:

"We believe the state should foment and stiaulate private

economy, both national and foreign.

We have to have an

effective democracy in Latin America because the word

denocracy in that area has been prostituted too often.

Many countries call themselves democratic but in reality

are nothing but militarist and demagogic, and many siaply

go through the motions of elections:

Many are simply

totalitarian governments which are living off the blood

and toll of the people.

"Our men in Cuba are not only fighting for the independence

off our country but also for the independence of the American

hemlaphere, for the survival of Christian principles in

America,

for the Western world."

Artime maintains that

the situation today is much the way lenin would have hoped

for. Britain and France have recognized Red China; the

U.So la at odds with these two governments--this is exactly

what Lenin would have wanted.

Artime has supported his

statements, by quoting Lenin,

"Within 30 years we will e

bark on a peace ortensive,

of coeristence,

and we will

pilt the free nations and anash the impotent bourzeois."

"The battle ground jor Latin America lies 30 miles fron

our whores.

Should the Western world lose this battle,

the sleeping giant (Latin America) w111 wake up on the

mide of the Communint camp.

Then it would be preferable

to be dond because the free world will hare consed to be."

"We nro all guilty for having turned over. Cuba to the hande

that portion of the training dealing with the principles.of

survival and the issuance of individual equipment.

In the course

of the training, AMBIDDY-l was given several practical tactical

problems to solve.

AMBIDDY-I's solutions to these problems were

logiel and reflected a grasp of the techniques to which he had

been exposed during the training sessions.

Thomas L. DARGUZIS vas

the orimary instructor in this phase of the training, and he assessed

organization of a basic set, consunications and reporting techniques.

In the course of this training,

ANBIDDY-1

expressed a particular

interest in the subjects of security, cover and compartmentation.

Charles F. MASESGILl was the pricary

instructor for this bloc of

tra-ning, and he reports that AlcIDDy-l was a keen student tho

appreciated the opportunity to learn as much as possible about

clandestine operations.

MASENGILL believes that AMBIDDY-] at the

completion of his training was probably weakest on the topic of

how to report intelligence in ormation.

Besistance netlvity and Guerrilla artare: ABID

recolved training on the principles and concepts Inherent in

orgnizing an infiltration teas.

In addition, he was trained

relative to the principles of organizing a resistance net:

Additionally, he was trained in caching, denolition and sabotage

techniques.

AMBIDDY -1 also received instruction in the principles

and concepts of guerrilla warfare. AMBIDDY-l was also given an

opportunity to familiarize himself, through actual range firing,

with those weapons which are normally used by anti-ANthicl forces.

Alton T. PIRNACK: was the principal instructor for this bloc of

tralning.

PIRNACK reports tht AMBIDDY-l was responsive to the

AMBIDDY-] did not

hesitate to ask questions. nor to seek clarification of points which

he did not clearly understand. AMBIDDY-] did indicate that he was

• neophyte in the subject of PM operations, and, as a result, he

was mist appreciative of the training which he was receiving on

these subjects.

It was evident during this bloc of training that

caching was an entirely new facet of clandestine operations for

AMBIDDY»1.

3. COINT: Phase IL of AHIDDY-l's training concentrated

on exposing All DDi-1 to thome management techniques and principles

which are applicable to = injor clandestine operation against =

target like PBRUMEN.

This part of the training was carried out

exclusively by Andrew K. REUTEMAN and Stanley R. ZAMKA.. In this

phase of the training, AMBIDDY-l constantly expressed & great denl

of enthusiasm for the

subject material which was being presented.

Throughout the training, AMBIDDY I gave every indication that he

wis abeorbing the major portion of the training.

At the same

time, it was clear that he was overwhelmed by the material and the

ImpIlcations of what this training meant in terms of his conduct in

luture: operations.

After the management phase of AMBIDDY-1'g

Straining was completed, REUTENAN and ZAMKA reviewed the 83 hours

training program in its totality with AMBIDDY1'' In addition,

the

program was reviewed with all of the instructors who participated

In the training.

As a result of

this review, & consensus was

(ronched that, while AMBIDDY 1 1s an intelligent and responsive

student, the training which he received does not qualify him for

the position of senior officer in & major cladestine undertaking

againat PERUMEN.

The training did, however, alert AMbIDDY-] to s

number of problems and pitfalla which he should avoid in hia.

nctivittes.: This training alno provided certaia guide pouts for

AMBIDDY - 1,

but those guide ponte were laid out in such & concentrated

dose that

they cannot be sonidered

as an adequate substitute

for experience or training. In depth

over an extended period of

time.

SYNOPSIS OF AMBIDDY-I'S SPEECH TO AREC

18 March 1964

"You will forgive me if before a gathering the Agrupacion de

In Reconstruccion Economical in Cuba I do make profound economic

or technical analysis of the reconstruction of Cuba, the reason

1s very simple, It 1s because I don't know. Inasmuch as I do not

like to talk about things which I know nothing. of I prefer not to

touch upon the suoject.

Here at this gathering there are men nore

capable than I. sin who will have the difficult task of the

reconstruction of Cuba upon their shoulders.

I want to talk about what I know about. But firat let me

present my crodentials. why the presentation of credentials? When

two people speak for the first time the Lirat portion is the

presentation and this in the first time I talk with. AREC, although

I have the plensure of speaking to some of its nembers separately

und 1n Erent lengths, Why this presentation of crodentials?

Bocaine. I know our movement is very controvorial. They say we are

of the extreme right, they may ve are of the extreme left; they may

in are opportunint and they say we are ambitsous. I do not expect

to change anyone's mind by this talk.. I belleve: It in my duty to

wmort certain prineiples and to mention our belleiu.: Not a

eriteria of profound economic prinoiples!.. & aa not en

In which it professes and will continue to profess and for which

we are prepared to give our !lves and in some cases already have.

I bellove it is our duty to mention them here or anywhere else. • .

*First of all I do not belleve in extremes... neither loft v

nor right. I belleve extremes always end by touching one another.

• Secondly. I want to state that 11 any extreme comes to power in

Cuba, in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship;

in both cases we shall continue to fight with our weapons in hand.

*Thirdly, I do not bellove in the claenification of men by

race, political levels in the government to which they formerly

belonged nor by money... I know whites who souls are black and I

know blacke who souls are white. I know wealthy men who are:

piritually poor and poor who are spliitually wealthy. I only.

believe in one clansification of men and that 1s the moral

cinnaificatiog-non of honor and men without honor. Men who. keep

their word and those who do not keep their word. • In this.

clansliication I do belleve...

Are we opportunist? This depends what your definition of

opportunint 1u. If by opportunist you menn taking mastmum advantage

of ench opportunity, then ladies and gentlemen, we are portunint.

In order to save Cuba we have to take maximum advantage of every:

opportunity, But 11 by opportuninto you menn the man who changen

hin ballote in accord with the opportunities, then we are not

AMBIDDY-I goes on to mention his various publications. He

describes his first publication, "Communis» por que? (Communis

what for?) which he wrote nine months prior to Castro coming to

power. The main theme of this pamphlet, according to 4-1, as

that more than changing a government what 1s needed is a change in

men's conscience. The pamphlet also outlined the duttes of the

padron (land owner) to the workers so that the latter my lives

in dignity and in honor. The fatron should feel that the problems

of his workers are also his problems. The vorker. In turn has

certain obligations to the patron. If this guid pro suo 18 not

adhered to the (Christian) government has the right to intervene

for the common good.

•Intor on, alter Castro was in porer, A-l wrote his lettor o1

resignation accusing Castro of being a communist and traitor.

In this letter A-I mentions he resigned because Castro had not been

honest with the businessmen by not telling them their property

would be confiscated.

A-l then went into exile and there he published a book called

Traicolon (Betrayal). This book clearly outlined the ldedlogxy of

the novement.

'"He bellove the state should forneat and simlats privato

the way. Lenin would have hoped for. Britain and France have recog

nined Red China; the U. S. is at odds. with these two goverments.

This, A-1 maintains, is exactly what lenin would have wanted. A-I'

then quotes Lenin, "Within 30 years we will embark on a peace

Offensive, of coexistence and we will split the free nations and

mash the impotent bourgeois."

•The battle ground for Latin America lies 90 miles from our

whores in a place called Cuba. Should the Wester world lose this

battle the sleeping giant (latin Amrica) will wake up on the side

We cannot afford to wait for miracles because only God can create

miracles. "e must prepare for a long, light and not expect the aid

of such organizationg as the OAS, UN. It is up to the Cubans to

liberate Cuba. We elther

have to wage a war of principles or not.

If we are not going to wage a var of principles I will' not join

that struggle.

"The present situation of the case of Cuba. The present state

of our homeland. Communism is completely established. We lose

dally 10 fighters for freedom. In the cities communism is in complete

control. It is necessary for an individual to carry five different

credentials in order to travel inside of Cuba. Lack ef any one of

these credentials brings down the repressive measures of the G?

until the individual can explain the reason for his missing

credentials.
