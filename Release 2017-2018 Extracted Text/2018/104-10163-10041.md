Opening up between AMVORLD and AMYUM's old guard (to



2

which AMYUN.19 belongs), liaison with AMWORLD conducted
through AMYUM-19 ipso facto involves KUBARK in factional
strife. We recall that some of the major trou!
setting the action mechanism prior Playa Giron stemmed
from the interference’ of political commissars.. Without
derogating from the importance of the ideological ~
component in the struggle against AMTHUO,in any showdown
between the military command and the political functionary
corps, it behooves us to range KUBARK alongside the
former unless the points at iasue manifestly implicate -
PRPRINE security. Under AMWORLD groundrulesa KUBARK -
eupports AMBIDDY.1 as the commander of an unconventional
warfare instrument, not an exile organization, let alone
the ideology and aspirations which animate it.

@. The ANYUM opposition group represented by AMBUM.15
@learly desires a share in the deciaton-making processes
which KUBARK has entrusted to AMBIDUY-1. While they pay
lap service to the principle of non-interference in
 ogrtad military affairs, in the final analysis it would

impossible to keep the two aspects apart. Any con-
@eesions on KUBARK’s part to the pretensions of the
AMYUN opposition would confront KUBARE with intangibles
fm the form of occult pressures brought to bear upon
SMBIDOT-1 whose impact we could not possibly gauge or
ebe . -

area will deprive AMBIDDY-1 of all excuse to divide his
a between Central America (where he belongs) and the

area.

h. The tawdry aftermath of the ZENOM IZ raid can
§ustly be blamed if not on AMYUM, at least on AMBIDDY.2's
political representation in the WAVE area. With that
representation effectively eliminated, one:of the main
gwources of ODYOKE discomfiture will have been effectively
dislocated. Impending changea should at least eliminate
the AMYUM press and intel sections.

&. Should there be further unpleasantness in the
WAVE area, KUBARK will, once contacts with AMYUM-19 have
eeased, have a base for plausible denial‘of responsibility
for not preventing it.

Regarding this fundamental issue he and KUBARK may be at odds.

what he knows to unauthorised persons, is difficult to assay.
Should be in honest conviction reach the conclusion that he was
shunted aside because. KUBARK considered him an obstacle to -
! eatablishing full sway over AMBORLD, he could easily rationalize
a betrayal. Other "ideological" considerations could be adduced
by him to justify actively opposing KUBARK. .Whatever he may
do along those lines would not be through inadvertence but by
design. We havewighed.and discarded the possibility of. .
neutralizing him through Fecruitment. This would not work if
our reading of his personality ie correct. We can think of =
aumber of deterrents, out of KUBABK's reach, which will probably
make him think twice before throwing down the gauntlet. To
provoke the enmity of both AMBIDDY-1 and KUBARE would. be an act
@f defiance of which we consider: AMYUM-19 incapable. Dczides,
ANYUM-19 strikes us as an indivuidal imbued with.a sense of basic
decency and of Christian morality.

6. In balance we doubt whether ANYUM-19 is going to pose

& Major threat to the security of AMWORLD. In any case, HOS
decision to accede to AMBIDDY-1's desires on working level.
Afaison, even if it entails a rupture in relations with ANYUM-19,
was made in full awareness of the fact that he could cause
trouble and inflict damage if this be hie intent. Should this
Goma to pass, hovever,.it would be unfair to shift the entire

1. We advised SAMRORA at a Washington meeting with him,
16 June 1964, that from the way things look to us he had pai ted
himself inte # corner from which he could not extricate himself.
Another’ error was to have permitted someone like to block
bis. path to the AMWORLD hierarchy, This in retrospect, however,
is all water over the dam.

2. If SAMBORA ts to perform his functions as we first con
ceived them he should go to AMBIDDY-1 and arrive at a new understand!
SAMEORA was informed that we intend to meet AMBIDDY-1 before
SAMBORA returne to Miami. At this meeting we intend to state in
no uncertain terms that the security of the organization is in a
@oplorable condition, This perhaps may have the effect of placing

im a more favorable bargaining position, fo

3. We counseled SAMBORA to negotiate a hard contract which
would encompass at least the following terms:

a. He would not wort under nor be responsible to
‘but only to the highest echelons of AMWORLD hierarchy.

bd. Full access to all files, bases, information needed
to perform a professional job.

c. The complete and unhesitating support of AMBIDOY=1 in

1. The following AMOT report concerning the not-so-private
affairs of AMBIDDY/1 and his fiaricee may be of interest to
_ BECKHOFF. According to AMYUM/19, AMBIDDY/1 intends to formalize
: his relationship with Iden B sometime within -the next few months.

The marriage wi:1 probably take place in Latin America and Iden
B will make her home there to avoid a public scandal which would
have a harmful effect on the AMYUM organization. Attention is
called to paragraphs 14, 17, and 26 which answer, in part, some of
the questions raised in ref dispatch concerning ODYOKE involvement
an AMWORLD, The Station has forwarded reports of this nature
which concern claims by members of the Cuban exile community of
KUBARK sponsorship of AMBIDDY/1. Of the specifics cited by the -
Cuban, intelligent or otharwise, to support their allegations
those statements attribu:ed to the AMWORLD principals thomzelves:
appear to be the only ones which can make a claim to “knowledge”
a8 oppcsed to conviction based on AMWORLD's affluence. To date
no tangible evidence of KUBARK involvement with AMWORLD has come
to our attention.

9. Source further states that in view of the fact she
(source) has many friends who like “poses”, she was able to
introduce to AMBIDDY/1 some important Venezuelans including
Colonel Pulido BARRETO, Carlos SISO (mat. unk.) and Osvaldo

* BAJARES (Venezucian sconouisi). Source states that, at
AMBIDDY/1's request, three meetings were held with those
individuals in source's house, According to AMUIDDY/1 the
objective of the meetings was to get support for his plans,
and the objective of the Venezuelans was to overthrow Romulo
BETANCOURT, and they were allied to the National Liberation
Armed Forces (FALN). . The conversations revolved around CASTRO
Leon, The Venezuelans believed they could make a pact with
the Communists and later eliminate them, At that time various
members of FALN came to Miami (source doesn't remember when).
AMBIDDY/1 assured the Venezuelans he could influence GPFOCUS
and KUBARK to get support for their cause.

Carlos SISO told source he distrusted AMBIDDY/1 and
believed he was a KUBARK penetration to learn all their plans. -
SISO also told source that when Osvaldo BAJARES returned to
Venezuela he had been arrested, and SISO believed ANBIDDY/1
had denounced BAJARES, In the last meeting, SISO told seurce
that. he was going to put AMBIDDY/1 to a test. SISO asked him
“whether it was true he had gone to Haiti on an official mission
as an ODYOKE envoy.” AMBIDDY/1 was very surprised and said he
had, but insisted in SISO telling him how he had learned that.
The meetings with the groups of Venezuelans stopped since that

After these happenings, AMBIDDY/1 informed source he
had written a report te the Americans about the Venezuelan
problem, and that he had treated Rafael CALDERAS very well in
this report because CALDERAS had given him financial assistance.

10, -AMBIDDY/1 showed source an unbound book and told her

was the wost important book ODYOKE had because it contained
. “ailitary. secrets which were. known to.a very few. people. AMBIDDY/
yoasted of being one of the few man in the U, 8., who had. that
-document, Source leafed through the book and saw some weapons,
noticing that some of those weapons were marked, AMBIDDY/1
explained that those marked weapons are the ones which AMTHUG/1
bas in his possession,

11. Source further reports that on various occasions, in
wivate conversation which AM®(DDY/1 had with Iden B,

13. One time AMBIDDY/1, Iden B and source had a meeting and
discussed who should be the pilot of his private aircraft, Iden :
B proposed a pilot named ALEXANDEit (according to source, ALEXANDER \
had relations with Iden B,) but AMBIDDY/1 opposed tris and
complained thrt the PBPRIMERS forced him to select the personnel,

14. About 7 months ago (on or about Nov. 63), AMBIDDY/1 told
Iden B and source that he was going to receive a secret training :
course under PBPRIME direction, AMBIDDY/1 used to leave every
day at 6 AM and come back at night. According to source, the i)
course lasted 6 weeks and most of the times Iden B used to drive
AMBIDPY/1 in an automobile to.a place in Coral Gables where the
course was being given. Every time ANBIDDY/1 returned from the
classes he talked about the things he had learned and talked
about secret writing, codes, of some pens with a substance which A
could kill instantaneously, about sabotage methods, etc., etc.

15. AMBIDDY/1 frequently spends long hours at night in his
house making up accounts to justify expenses.

16, After Iden B's divorce, AMBIDDY/1 moved with her to 881
“WE Vist Street, AMBIDDY/1 talks constantly in the house where he .
lives with her about his future plins, about the single party,
about the dictatorship which has to be imposed in Cuba, etc.
b : AMBIDDY/1 often puts on a uniform, poses in front of the mirror ar Hee
talks about invasion.

H _ WAVE Comment: This is one of several recent reports
{ concerning statements attributed to AMBIDDY/1 in which he has
t spoken of the need for a strongman to run Cuba. AMSHADY/1 reports
that om 10 June Aurelio MARIN Naredo (one of approximately 30
i AMBORLDERS recently arrived from the camps) states that AMBIDDY/1
appeared at the training camps, took a dictatorial position on a
number of issues terminating with the statements to the effect
e | that he was the only one to liberate Cuba, he was the only one to
run it later, and that there would be no voting. and no elections.
MARIN.‘objected, stating that he had joined a revolutionary group,
=< ‘not a dictatorship, and along with other trainees requested to
return to the WAVE area, According to AMSHADY/1 when the trainees
arrived and went to the 4MYUM offices to receive their final check
AMJAVA/4 refused, a fight ensued and AMYUM/19 had to intervene,
MARIN characterized AMBIDDY/1 as deceitful, liar, coward, demagogu ,
@ictator, power mad, a flagrant opportunist whe cannot be trusted,
etc, Realizing that AMSHADY/1 is strongly prejudiced’ against
AMBIDDY/1 this comment is forwarded for what it is worth, “AMYUM/
has cortirmed.the incident at the AMYUM office and states that,
whether or not it ie: justified, there is a considerable number of
24WORLDERS who hold similar views now and who attribute statements
to AM@ZUDY/1 which. are inconsistant with his previous public.
atatements.

17, At.the time of Prowident KEHNEDY's death,. source asked
AMBIDDY/1 whether this would liorm him and ho. replied emiling that
4t did not, that. now he wae receiving more aid than before,
AMBIDDY/1 told source that he. bed received @ card from Mra.

Intelligence, Iden H, is married to a woman named Iden I, who
practices prostitution, AMBIDDY/1 has ordered the Intelligence "i
Chief to collect information on Iden B, but all the reports he t
submits on her are good because the AMYUM Intelligence Chief is
ar unconditional supporter of Iden B, One time the AMYUM’

Intelligence Chief hit an AMYUM member because he made unfavorable a
comments about Iden By H

21, Source learned from Iden B that Juan AMADOR Rodriguez is
one of the newspapermen in exile who receive money from AMBIDDY/1,.

BATI£TA uarried her off to iden C, a member of, the
Constitutional  aray with @ terrible moral reputation,

Iden B used to “pose” with her sister to please her lover
BATIGSA and her husband. Afterwards, Iden C continued to exploit
iden Bwith thie “posing”.

When Iden B arrived in the U. 8. (wource does not

25.. Source further reports that Iden B had homosexual
relations with Iden A (source #1), In turn, this Iden A also
has homosexual relations with a known homosexual naned iden G,
aka "Campeona”, who lives with Iden B and ANBIDDY/: .

According to source, this group of “ladies” used to meet
with Olga" GUILLOT Vidal both in Cuba and here in Miami to hold
"parties", One of Iden B's friends is Aida PEREZ Poze, aka "La
Gorda", who together with-Pat (aka "La Americana”) are partne!
of a man called “Chucho" who is in jail on charges of narcotics
trafficking in which he was recently surprised,

Source states that she is well acquainted with Iden B's

intimate affairs because she knew her in Cuba and lived in her
house here in Miami for one year.

26. Source 3; ANCRAG/1
: On 17 May 8 talked to
AMWORM/2 and told him was investigating the private lives

of AMBIDDY/1 and Iden B, because-it seems it is feared AMBIDDY/1

Bebjoct would be one of the causes for KUBARK to

exnphatically answered in the negatives, going over by
now well-trodden ground once more and, hopefully,
wnking syself understood.

3. ‘In summary, I stated we held no views one way

@ur concern was strictly political since we could -

never had blind confidence in anytiing human, because everything
that is done blindly is done badly, it is true that I had cone
fidence in North Anerican material help. Reason: because we
were seeing it. (I do not think it was a secret to anyone where
the weapons. we used in the invasion came from.) TI. had no sorte
ples in accepting Aneriean weapons to offset those from gussia
which Fidel Castro was receiving in gigantic shipments.

after leaving prison I lost coniidence in that assistance
because since then not only have I seen none, but also I have
not seen the possibility even of getting any.

Dut also my gratitude toward these people who have opened their
arms to offer us help when all doors were peing closed against
us, Thanks to them we can continue the struggle.

to hold im ny heart the inage of DeGaulle, hero of the Second ‘ a

western David called Cuba has already let fly the stone which

will imook down the ugly Goliath of comunian,



A CONTROVERSIAL FERCONALITY
It can be said of the Secretary General of the Kovezent
for Revolutionary Recovery, Mamuel artine, that there is such
to sey, but néxer that he has lacked spirit to fight for the
:
Liberty of Cuba.
Conbative and polemical, artine today occupies a singu- : ‘

wo. ler position in the fight against Castro in which he collects 4 iH
‘furious insults and almost fanatical proselytiem in equal quan- i

tities. Hir early struggle against Batista's dictatorship and
“chia aotivity in Sierra Maestra in Colum One. commanded by Fidel
“Gastro, made hin an outstanding figure in the Revolution. His
“wreak with castro and his demnotation of the olive green trea-
ohery ‘to the great romance of the> ‘Cuban: people made him the
target for all attacks and insults. In the spring of 1960 Ar-
time went into exile. In Mexico he wrote a-beok denouncing
‘gastro's apostasy, - ith other eminent -democratio-leaders. he.
helped ‘1euna the Revolutionary Front (later Comittee) and ez-
“erted intense propaganda and political activity throughout the
continent which owlminated in the disastrous Bay of Pigs inva-
i sions ‘This was one.of the most critical points in Manuel ar-
time's oivic career. His activity in it -- personally heroic
though it wae <= helped throw on hin the shadow of new attacks
“and suspioions.. But 1 also converted him into a leader of. the
‘-¢4ret rank Which the maturity of:a prison ‘term and. Ris, sonspi-
“yatorial and revolutionary activities afterward only. enhanced.



Lemus Avtine hee tecess todey, by virtue of the attack
of his troops on Puerto Piién, the principal figure of eurrent
Cuban activity. His group hes been hammered into one of the
most disciplined, one of the largest and mst efficient in the
heroic struggle of the people of Cuba for their liberty. Con~

sequently everything he does and says is of passionate interest:

for this people in exile, a people which wants to know closely
+ and they should -- the thoughts and activities of the men
who will probably lead them in the future.

@his is why Manuel artine is brought to these, Cuban
pages of BOHRA, which have been, are now and will continue
to be the ideal civic rostrum for the people of Cuba.

off-the-record talk with Al Burt of the Miami press would
dono harm, We consider Burt to be a responsible newspaper- ~
man and he may be in a position to help A-1 put the.

Pilon raid in its proper pepspective, If A-1 thinks

this is & good idea he should speak openly to Burt about

the Pilon raid omitting the embroidery that has accompanied
his recent press statements, A-i was reminded this inter=
view, if given, snould not mention or allude to KUBARK
support. Since Burt is an ambitious journalist he may: ©
probably ask A-1 iut a scap on his next. raid; again. we see
fo harm.in this, 4-1 said he would ask Burt if he wanted ~

S2000ELD MEETING 15 WASHINGTON, D.C. 19 May 1966

SUBJECT: AMBIDOY‘s Reaction to. Advice to
Delay. Retura to U.S.

1. AWJAVA/6 reported that ANYUNe19 conveyed to
ABIOVY-1 ay advice that be not retura to PAFRDG right
emay, but permit the dust te settle. According to
@4JAVA/4 tts advice led AMBIDDY-1 to conclude that
OBACID did not want his back in PBPRIME. Is order to
test this theory, AMBIDDY-1 desided to make « beeline
fer ths U.3. Embassy in Managua to pick up his imnie
gration visa.

2. (Headquarters has learned that the vise was
promptly granted and wa presume AMBIDDY-1"s concern
-Ghat be had. been exiled a second time has as.a resul¢
been assuaged.). I asked AMJAVA/4 to tell AMBIDDY-1
that we would be honored to welcoma him.as a potential
Gellow-citizen. Also, our relationship was based-upon.
eenplete wotual trust. Our job was to protect his
wear in PBPAIME. What we were concerned about tas. that
SMBIBDY-1, should be return at this tima, would. me

doubtedly be talked.ta by ODACID, ODENVY and the press. -
: all this ie would be best to sidestep.

3. MUAVA/4 was asked to convey to AMBIDDY-1
that we will tell him. when the coast is clear. If this
eetwithstanding ke should return to PEPRIME, ths desisicn
‘ would, of course, be his. "It is his right to come back

et any tine, but I think ay advice is good." ~

8. AWAVA/6 stated that there had been assy betrayals
end consequently AMBIDUY-1 was always carefal. At tines
be might even think that AMYUM-19 was not loyal which,
AMIAVA/4 added, "Of course is not true." As A@BIDOT-1
apalyzes his ow performance, he is satisfied that be is
perforuing well. %« has been in the resistance business t:
since Batista's days and many intimate friends have be- i
trayed him. At the prescat moment, he does not ‘have 100%,
confidence in anyone. verything he is told, he analyses.

As an example, amsava/4 briefs Chaves (the Mcxican) cn a .
projected operation. AMBIDDY-1 will questicn “AMSAVA/S :
@losely in order to meke sure that the instructions did

wot deviate from the plan as conceived by him. - asus

9. Among matters which should be teken up with
AMBIDDY-1 direct, ne matter how ticklish, was.@.g. the.
ease of .. HOLE. ARJAVA/4 and AMTUM-19: know. that KUBARK
have a poor opinica of hin. Then why beet around. the
Bash? AMJAVA/4 at least had not witnessed any mention

in fol's presence. Instead
* @MYUM-19 had reported ZLER's etatewent: thet he con-
sidered KOLE a poor choice for the intelligence job to
AMBIDOT-L and the latter hed jumped to the conclusion that.

eo tell GUEEERLER or wyself {f in a gives instance o
demarchs. is indicated. There are certain things .
with AMBIDDY-1 out of the comtry, simply camot.bs put
@a the shelf. We have no choice but to tell GUEWIELER
to tell AMYUM-19 who, however, simuld feel. tres te. counsel
ep garnet te we hin as « channel. Headquarters rep conceded
: that AWIDOYeL cosld sightly resent anything which sescks
of @ junior officer (1.0. GUEATELER) giving orders to him

erediaate.

Li. BECKROVY stressed that we were enzious sot to
give AHBIDDY-1 the impression that there exists any.
epecial relationship between us and AKYUH-19, AMJAVA/4,
Our relz’ionship was with AMBIDDf-1 who is the leader
of the movement. AHJAVA/4. replied that be had told aMBIDOToL
this and that BECKHOVF had made this point very clear at
their first wseting in Puerte Rico (see AGIORLD Meeting
meno, 3-6 Septender 1963 Subject: Briefing of AWAVA/4.)
BECKROPF added that. he had told AMYUM-19 and wished to
repeat this in the presence of AMIAVA/4 that anything
Giscussed while AMBIDDY-1 was net present, could be told
hia. Nothing was “off-theerecord" in the sense of to:
be withheld from AMBIDDY-1. : . a

12. According t» AMJAVA/4, AMBIDDY-1 knows. full
well that KUZASK considers him the Chief. If we decided
to conspire against AMBIDDY-1 in leagus with AMJAVA/&
end AMTUMe19, this could only be done within AMYUM, the
political movement, since AMJAVA/4 and AMTUM-19 fore pars
ef that organization. Our support, however, ie to
AMBIDDT~1 and not AMYUM.. AMBIDDY-1 knows: that.

1, According to ANYUM-19 (DOI 4 May), AMBIDDY-1 once more 1s
giving serious thought to contracting marriage with Subject.

2. According to ANYUM-19, ANBIDDY-) suffers pangs of conscience
and has presonitions of hell. What he has in mind is a church
wedding with all the trimmings. Since Subject's previous sarriage

was not solemnized by the Church, bcerchavarts bet ‘conscience appears
unbothered.

3. AMYUM-19 claims that AMBIDOY-1 brushes off allegations about
Subject’s ‘alleged affair with Fulgencio Batista as mere calumny.
He does not know whether AMBIDDY-1 has ever asked Subject to confirm
or deny the rumor,

4. The root of the trouble, as ANYUN-19 sees it, is that ANBIDDY-}
in the person. of Subject is encountering a seasoned pro who plays with
consummate skill upon his vanity and who exploits hia naivete which
is that of "a 14 year old." AMBIDDY-1, in fashioning personal relation-
ships; unable to make adjustments to the circumstance that, being
&@ person .of some importaice, his personal affections are not always
cultivated om purely unselfish grounds.

2 8. ANYUE-1¢ claims that Subject’s former husband, Roger Hermilio

Rojas Lavernib, is attempting to blackmail AMBIDDY-1 and that some of

AMBIDDY-1'g seemingly closest associates may be harboring similar
éesigns,

6,. BECEHOFF restated the position of KUBARK as one of non-inter-
vention as long a¢ matrimony is kept in abeyance. Conversely, marriago
and any ensuing scandal would force us to re-aseess our position and,
‘im extremes, might force KUBARK to withdraw ite backing of AMWORLD.

5%. |‘ AKYUM-19 expressed the view that AMBIDDY-1 would probably

forego marriage if made aware of KUBARK's position as stated above

otherwise), would be told just that.

ZBic7oorb AMJAVA~4 and aHYUU-19 without KUBARK attempting to

SURROUNDING COL. RANE NOAM AS SURFACED IN RECENT BOOK ON BAY OF PIGS



AMUOLD Meeting in San Juan, P-R., 2-5 May 1964
SUBJECT: Cackling Over Unlai¢ Zges -

2. ANYUM.19 confided “> us that AMBIDDY-1 had, prier to.
the launching of Operation ZKHOK, prepared a “three and cag
half page” news release which laid exaggerated claim to
damages inClicted during the raid on Santa Cruz del Sur.

Ouly the last sentence wtated, sore or leas as on afterthought,
¢hat this should be considered just a minor MRR operatioa.
AMYUM-29 has told ANBIDOY-1 that in bis opinion any future
qnaouncements should be held down to one or tvo brief pare-

graphs.

2%. We pointed out to ANTUS-19 that AMBIDDT-1 was.
evidently psying mo more than lip service to our recomes-
@atioa that he under-—rather than over--play his successes.

Baring the Washington necting 419-21 March 1964) we. had.
Griticized a statenent made by ‘AMBIDDY-1 during a Hiami presse
eenference to wit: "He do not have enough boats. In one
night we can make two trips but not nore, but we are doing

4¢. Ge will £411 the country with enough aras to free the

cg nt

ou from communiam." We took the position that if we were
4m AMBIDDY=1's shoes: ve simply woulda't let on. about military:
pattese since this plgys into Castro’s hands, giving him.
- gratuiteus access to military inteiligesss.. AMBIDDY-1
: ‘asking. ue how he could raise the moralo of the
people without saying anything end without. talking aboat
euseeesaful ops inside.

3. We mentioned to AMBIDDT-1 thet any vital informa
a tien aot publicized makes the task of Castro's espioaage
gervice that more difficult. Besides, things had now come
. tom pass where Little credence was placed in claims. of
guccess and promises beid out by Cuban exile leaders. What
waally counted was the demcastrable substance ef cuccess
Sneide which -epenks for iteeli. ANBIODI~E vould be Bech
mere effective by preservirg & posture of insorutability.
We counselled AMBIDUT~1 te resist a natural tendeacy to



SECRET

ot

finflate the significance of bis iuitial successes and to presest
Chen in their proper perspective. He spould refer te tusso
successes ag were appetizers, with the main dish to follow
Later. This approach rather then the claim of a big victory
would arvase the kind of interest, ‘and in Castru's case, the
kind of premonition which carries psychological impact.

4. Ve doubt whether AMBIDOT-1 st thie stage is prepared
‘yo heed our counsel to be. conservative in his clains te: Victory.

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-1, 9 April 1964,
1315 hours

“4, The following was relayed to AMBIDDY-1: "We are ~
glad you have second thoughts about Playa Giron. VWe have
. Feceived more information about military, eepecially maritime,
build-up in that sector which would make any landing attempt H
virtually suicidal.” AMBIDDY-1 stated he would confer with 5
AMJAVA=4 and AMYUM-19-and give us his final. decision as..to {
whether or not this operation would be run.‘ AMBIDDY-1 commented '
‘that one life meant more to him than the entire operation. How
-ever; A=1 again reminded this office of the: impact an. attack
on Playa Giron on the 17th of April would have on the morale
of the Cuban people. The undersigned replied that. there are
two ides to the coin; should their operation fail, this would
‘play into the hands of Castro, and it was: the opinion of this
‘office that the alternate plan would also do‘much to raise the
of the Cuban people.

4 Cuban exile observer who was present during the speech.

Headquarters Comment. The following is a résumé of the political
philosophy of Wanuel Artime Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de
Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary
Recovery) as prepared by Source, It is based on statements

made by Artime in his speech on 18 March 1964 to the Associacién
para Recuperacién Econémica de Cuba (AREC, Association for
Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled

Comunismo por qué? (Communism zor what?), which was written
nine months 6.

e@iore Castro came to power, and on Artime's book
Traicién (Betrayal).

Artime does rot believe in political extremes -—— neither the
left nor the right. He believes that extremes always end by
touching one another. If any extreme gains power in Cuba,

and in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship,
he will continue to fight with weapons in hand. Artime does
not believe in the classification of men by race, by political
ranks in former governments, or by money, He confesses ‘to. being
@n opportunist in the sense that he is taking maximum advantage
of each opportunity, but not in the sense of changing his
beliefs in acnord with opportunities,

The main theme of Comunismo r_qué? was that more than a change
in government a chinge in the conscience of men is needed, It

outlined the duties of the padr6én (landowner) toward the workers
go that the latter may live in dignity and honor. The

padron, :
should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems.

The worker, in turn, has certain obligations to the padron, If

this grid pro quo is not adhered to, a (Christian) government
has the Fight e adntervene for the common geod. In his letter
of resignation to Fidel Castro accusing the latter

a HE LI rete



Communist and. trattor, Artime mentioned that he resigned
because Castro had not been honest with the businessmen by
pot te}ling thes their property would be confiscated,

3:° Te following excerpts from Artime’s book Traicion clearly
outline Artine's ideology:

\ a. “We believe the state should foment and stimulate private

o economy, both national and foreign. We have to have an
effective democracy in Latin America because the word.

t democracy tn that area has been prostituted too often.

i Many countries call themselves democratic but in reality

j are nothing but militarist and demagogic, and many sixply

i go through the motions of elections. Many are simply

H totalitarian governments which are living off.the blood

H and toll of the people. The corrupt politicians, the

rong men, the totalitarians have been the etrongest

allies of Communism, Our. fight is not against one man,

| it is not a war of personal hatred--it is a war against

t the doctrine of hatred, be it called Castro or what have

| you--it is a war against a doctrine; re are as much opposed

to Khrushchev as we are 2: ast Tito, We are as much opposed

to the totalitarian left as we are opposed to the fascist right?

b. “We don't care if they call us extremist. They will con-
tinue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philocom-
munist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was
passing on the outskirts of a small town and Sancho said
to Don Quixote, ‘Sir, the dogs are barking at us,' Don
Quixote replied, ‘Let them, Sancho, if they are barking
it‘is because we are moving. And we will continue to move.'”

c. “They say we are very ambitious. Our ambition is that ‘ta
: the coming days when Cuba -is liberated people will pro-
-Rounce our name with respect in our country."

d.. "Our men in Cuba are not only fighting for the independence
of our country but also for the independence of the American
sphere, for the survival of Christian principles in
America, for the Western world." Artime maintains that..
the situation today is much the way Lenin would have hoped
for. . Britain and France have recognized Red China; the
U.S. ia at odds with these two ao peer iairoes is exactly
what Lenin would have wanted, Artime has supported his
statements, by quoting Lenin, "Within 30 years we will em-
bark on.a peace oztensive, of coexistence, and we will
split the free nations and smash the impotent bourgeois."

“The battie-ground sor Latin America’ lies 20 miles from
Should the Western world lose this battle,
the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the
side of the Communist camp, Then it would be preferable
to be dead because the free world will have consed to be.”

"We are-all guilty for having turned aver. Cube. to the hands
ef men who could not govern her properly. We have: knocked
on doors and will continue to do 6o because our cause i6:-
honorable, We cannot afford. to wait for miracles We
suet prepare for a long fight and not expect tho aid of :
such organigations as -the-OAS and the UN, . It is up to the
Cubans to liberate Cuba, If we are not going to wage a
war of principles, I wila not. join that struggle.”

TERE REQueRD  RERERENCES

ACTION REQUIRED:

None; for your information and files,

1. INTRODUCTION: In the period 6 to 18 January 1964,
AMBIDDY-1" was given 83 hours of tutorial training, in JMWAVE safe-
house facilities, on existing operational doctrine and management
techniques applicable to a major clandestine effort against. PBRUMEN.
A copy of the training schedule which was used in this tutorial
training is attached. At the completion of the training course,
the various training instructots submitted an evaluation on

;-AMBIDDY-1. These evaluations are outlined in the following
paragraph. z

2. EVALUATIONS: The below-listed evaluations were prepared
by the instructors who participated primarily in Phase I of
-AMBIDDY-1's tutorial training, The Phase I instruction concentrated
on: imparting- to AMBIDDY-1 current operational doctrine relative to
unconventional warfare techniques. The evaluations are as follows:

responded most enthus: cally to all aspects the training on
small.unit techniques. He made detailed notes on the material
covered, and these notes included copies of treining charts and
diagrams, AUBIDDY~-1 displayed particularly intensive interest in

_ that portion of the training dealing with the principles of

“‘gurvival and the issuance of individual equipment. In. the course

‘Sof the training, AMBIDDY-]1 was given several practical tactical

problems to solve. AMBIDDY-1's solutions to these problems were

logical and reflected. a grasp of the techniques to which he had

been exposed during the training sessions. Thomas L. DARGUZIS was

the primary instructor in this phase of the training, and he assessed

AMBIDDY-1 as being an intelligent, alert, highly-motivated

individual who has a realistic appraisal of his own limitations.

and capabilities. i este

organization of a basic net, communications and reporting techniques.
In the course of this training, AMBIDDY-1 expressed a particular
interest in the subjects of security, cover and compartmentation,
Charles F. MASENGILL was the pricary instructor for this bloc of
traning, and he reports that AXEIDDY-1 was a keen student who
appreciated the opportunity to learn as much as possible about
clandestine operations. MASENGILL believes that AMBIDDY-1 at the
completion of his training was probably weakest on the topic of

how to report intelligence information.

c, Resistance Activity and Guerrilla Verfar:
received training ie principles concep:
organizing an infiltration team, In addition,
relative to the principles of organizing a resistance net.
Additionally, he was trained in caching, demolition and sabotage
techniques, AMBIDDY-1 also. received instruction in the principles
and concepts of guerrilla warfare. AMBIDDY-1 was also given an -
opportunity to familiarize himself, through actual range firing,
with those weapons which are normally used by anti-AMTHUG-1 forces.
Alton T, PIRNACK was the principal instructor for this bloc of
training. PIRNACK reports tht AMBIDDY-1 was responsive to the
subject material which was presented to him. AMBIDDY-1 did not
hesitate to ask questions nor to seek clarification of points which
he did not clearly understand. AMBIDDY-1 did indicate that he was
&@ neophyte in the subject of PM operations, and, as a result, he
was must appreciative of the training which he was receiving on
these subjects. It was evident during this bloc of training that

7 tio hae an entirely new facet of clandestine operations for

AMBIDDT-1

3. . COMMENT: _ Phase II of AMBIDDY-l's training concentrated
on exposing ANBYDDY-1 to those management techniques and principles
which are applicable to a aajor clandestine operation against a
target like PBRUMEN, This part of the training was carried out
exclusively by Andrew K, REUTEMAN and Stanley R. ZAMKA, In this

‘ phase of the training, AMBIDDY-1 constantly expressed a great deal
of enthusiasm for the subject material which was being presented.
Throughout the training, AMBIDDY-1 gave every indication that he
wis absorbing the majc* portion of thé training. At the same
time,=.t was clear thst he was. overwhelmed by the. material and the

_ implications of what this training meant. in terms of.his conduct in

\. @uture operations, After the management phase of AMBIDDY-1's

training was completed, REUTEMAN and ZAMKA reviewed the 83 hours
training program in its totality with AMBIDDY-1. In addition, the
program was reviewed with all of the instructors who participated
dn the’training. As a result of this review, a consensus was
tyeached that; while AMBIDDY-1 is an intelligent anc responsive
student, the training which he received does not qualify him for
the position of senior officer in a major clazdestine undertaking

against PBRUMEN, ‘The training did, however, alert. AMBEDDY-1 to a
number of problems and pitfalls which “he should avoid in his
activities.:: This training also provided certain guide poats for
AMBIDDY-1, but these guide posts were laid out in such a concentrated
dose that they cannot be considered as an adequate substitute
for experience or training in depth over an extended. period of

time. 7

AMBIDDY-1 goes on to mention his various publications. He

describes his first publication, “Communism por que?“ (Communism -
what for?) which he wrote nine months prior to Castro coming to
power, The main theme of this pamphlet, according to A-1, was
that more than changing a government what is needed isa change in
men's conscience. The pamphlet also outlined the duties of the
padron (land owner) tc the workers so that the latter may livec
in dignity and tm honor. The yatron should feel that the problexs
of his workers are also his problems. The worker. in Xturn has
“eertain obligations to the patron. If this quid pro quo is not
adhered to ‘the (Christian) government has the right to intervene
_ for the common good, : ;

“Later on, after Castro was in power, A-1 wrote his letter of

nes SeLAANP TS IRS NGA RROD RT

resignation accusing Castro of being a communist and traitor.
_ Im this letter A-1 mentions he resigued because Castro had not been
“honest ith the businessmen by not telling them their property
Would be confiscated.

Traiccion (Betrayal), Tais book clearly outlined the idefioggy of

of publicity but we cannot subordinate the war to publicity, we are
subordinating the interests of publicity to the war. In a free
