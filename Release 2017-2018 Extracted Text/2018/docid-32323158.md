WILL TAM JANSS LOVERY, I., on 11/19/64, advised SAs

KUYKANDAL and WYRON T. SCHOLBERG in addition to data contained

in ballas aircel to Bureau, 11/19/6, that two or three days

previoualy he was contacted by Detective STRINGFELLOW and

another officer, both of the Special Service Bureau, Dallas

Police Department.

They had in their possession a list of names dealing

with forner members of the American GI Forun, Dallas. They

were

interested in developing information from him concerning

persons who had been in the GI Forun.

LOVElY stated he wanted te be cooperative with them,

and as they called certaia names, he told them as best he

could that they had been in the GI Jorun but had no affiliations

with any subversive organisations which included J. MOLINA.

He made it cloar to then that MCLINA was not a member of the

Connunist Party (CP) and so far as he knew had no knowledge

that the GI Forun had in the past been doninated or infil-

trated by the CP.

They inquired also about several other individuals,

Including

so RosS, AUGUStIN EStRADA, dOX LANDIN, anc

r7Li2 BULLO. LOisky stated as the officers came to the

names of those four individuals who had in the past been

affiliated with the CP, he declined to discues his knowledge

concerning those persons.

LOVERY realized after he bad con

pleted his discussion with them that the Dallas Police Department

officers may assume fron his failure to discuss those four persons

that they may have had some subversive background.
