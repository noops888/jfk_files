since certain information was not received from the auxillary

offices prior to the preparation of the referenced report.

By letter dated January 24, 1964, the Miami Division

advised that it does not anticipate any further investigation

relative to the missing 1902 white cadillac, rented by the

Cosmopolitan Corporation and missing since the summer of 1962.

Further investigation will be conducted relative to this matter,

In the event that additional information is developed to indicate

that it was

that the subject, even if found to be the person who took this

automobile, could claim and undoubtedly would be able to produce

witnesses

* to the fact that he had used this vehicle with the

proper authority of SIDNEY MOSS or some other official of the

Cosmopolitan Corporation.

On 1/21/64; NY 4317-C advised SA EUGENE J. HINDES

that he had just been contacted by ROCKY GRAZIANO and was ordered

by GRAZIANO not to leave town on business for the west Coast

until he had spoken personally to GRAZIANO.

The informant is of the opinion that this might

possibly be the

"showdown" on a demand for money by the subject

and his associates.

NY 4317-C advised that he would immediately report

any further developments in this respect.

Since the aforementioned information is singular in

nature,

it has not been ineluded in the details of this

report.

on 2/5/04, NY 4317-C advised that he had received

one papa hote a he intone ever meet ago home ver,

the informant is convinced this matter has not been forgotten

and will be repeated in the immediate future.

The informant further stated that he had been

recently advised by his attorney, that the latter had been told

by the former attorney of JOHN KEILLY, that KEILLY is in

considerable trouble relative to/conversion of approximately

$25, 000.00 to his own use and issuing a bad check to cover

the

maneuver.

According to the informant, the victim of this

present time, has

threatened to file a complaint.

The informant stated that he

would endeavor to ascertain additional information relative to

this

matter.

During the early part of February, 1964, NY 3936-0

advised SA WILLIAM A. VERICKER, that SALLY

BURNS and ROCKY

GRAZIANO have a fighter, who was scheduled to fight in Puerto

RiCo, on Saturday, February 15, 1964. BURNS told the informant

that

he wanted to go to puerto Rico to see the fight, but was

restricted because of his bail in the SDNY, relative

to an income

tax matter.

on 2/10/54, BURNS and his attorney filed a petition

before the US District Court, SDNY, to get permission to travel

to Puerto Rico.

This permission was denied by the court and

on 2/11/64, BURNS indicated to the informant that he still

intended to travel to Puerto Rico with his girl friend on

2/13/64.

On 2/13/64, NY 3936-C advised SA WILLIAM A. VERICKER

that the subject and his attorney recontacted a Federal Judge

in the SDNY on the morning of 2/13/64.

At that time, they

indicated that they wished to interview a prospective witness

relative to the income tax matter, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

However, their request was again denied by the

Federal Judge.

On several occasions on 2/13/64, NY 3936-C advised

SA VERICKER that he had been in contact with the subject and

the subject was still undecided whether or not to defy the

court order.

However, late in the afternoon of 2/13/64,

GRANELLO finally decided against any travel to Puerto Rico.

In view of the fact that the subject was dealing directly

with the informant in this matter,

this information has not been

included in the details of instant report.

During February, 1964, NY 3936-0 advised SA VERICKER

that it appears that GRANELLO has a hidden interest in Avon

Wreckers, since GRANELLO approached the informant and asked

for

a loan for this company.

The informant stated that an associate

of his had loaned Avon Wreckers $20,000.00 and the latter had

defaulted in their payments.

The informant stated that his

associate presently has a judgement against Avon Wreckers and has

threatened to go to the District Attorney unless GRANELLO Or

the principals of Avon, repay the loan.

During February, 1964, NY 4195-PC advised SA FREDERICK

W. KUHIMAN that one, FRANK VANDERVETTER (phonetic) has been a

close associate of SALLY BURNS during the past few weeks.

BURNS

nas told VANDERVETTER that RALPH SERRANO owes him, GRANELLO,

approximately $7,000.00. BURNS suggested that VANDERVETTER and

he, GRANELLO, coordinate their efforts to locate SERRANO for

repayment of this money and also some money owed to VANDERVETTER.

According to the informant, VANDERVETTER and BURNS

are closely aligned because of their mutual and intense interest

in women.

VANDERVETTER is currently keeping company with one,

MARLENE MAC LAINE, the daughter of movie actor, BARTON MAC LAINE.

MARLENE MAC LAINE

1s an exotic dancer, but according to

the

information furnished by VANDERVETTER

to the informant, she is

presently engaged either as a prostitute or an operator of a

house of prostitution.

VANDERVETTER indicated to the informant

that MAC LAINE resided at 300 East 51st Street, NYC, and operated

out of 309 East 51st St., NYC.

ADMINISTRATIVE Cont'd

VANDERVETTER is married to the daughter of the owner

of Rembrandt Frocks, a dress company in NYC.

The name of this

individual is not known to the informant.

However, the

intormant stated that the father-in-law of VANDERVETTER iS

completely alienated from VANDERVETTER and regards him as an

individual only interested in his daughter's money.

VANDERVETTER

reportedly withdrew all the money available to the : daughter

and is apparently trying to arrange for a large mortgage on a

home owned by the daughter in Harrison, NY.

BURNS is reported to be lending considerable sums of

money to VANDERVETTER.

The informant theorized that this money

is undoubtedly being put out in the form of shylock money and

that repayment for such loans will undoubtedly come from the

proceeds of the mortgage obtained by VANDERVETTER. In the

event this maneuver does not materialize, the informant is of

che opinion that GRANELLO will endeavor to exert pressure or

Rembrandt Frocks, through the intercession of VANDERVETTER's wife

with her father.

Since the informant is directly involved with the

subject and VANDERVETTER in this matter, this information has not

been included in the details of this report.
