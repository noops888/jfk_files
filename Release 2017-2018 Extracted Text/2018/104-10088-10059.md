Identification.

This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance

operation against the PBRUMPN Embassy in Mexico

City.

B. Objectives.: The operation 1b designed to (F sumish photosraphic coveres

during daylight hours of the entrances of the target installation, (2)

dispatch paysical surveillance teams against persons associated with the

arget, and (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring an

recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

C.

The target installation is the PERUMEN Embassy compound. (including

Consulate in Mexico City.

The above-listed objectives are accomplished by

two trained,. full-time surveillance agents who live across the street fron

the target.

The project is in consonance with Priority A, Objective 1, of the

current Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

Background. This project

1962 and costs have henetoforelbeen charged to PBRUMEN FI funds. The

operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMEN Embassy,

both staff and visitors.

these photographs are normally reviewed

for identi

fications by the PBRUMEN sectionat the Station, then shown separately to

LITAMI-9, and LITAMIL? who are penetration agents working inside

the target.

They are subsequently forwarded to the CI section of WH/SA where they are shown

to PBRUMEN intelligence defectors AMNIP-1 and AYMUG-1.

Of those assets to whom

they are routinely shown, LITAMIL-9Jhas to date made the largest number of

identifications.

The photos have proven of great value.

Within hours of the

arrival of a new ambassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the

Station;

In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos

(accompanied by a log kept by the LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action

(arrivals and departures) and details of personal associations (who associates

with whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against

the target.

In addition to photography, LIONION-I and LIONION-2 are

orten called upon

to do visual surveillance of the target installation and IIONION-l is essential

to the dispatching of the LIMBRACE surreillance team against individuals.

associated with the target.

Because of the presence of police patrol cars in

the vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the

target, hence the need for LIONION-l's dispatching services.

The prasenca of LIoNtoN-Dond ONION e also Alfures contined occupancy of

a valued piece of real estate which will be used asla listening post when the

Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in the

target in the

form of concealed radio transmitters.

his early rears. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer

was recruited in 1961, as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and

operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE technical operation aimed at the PBRUMEN

Embassy. At this same time LIONION-1 also phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and

the two worked together as a team. In 1962 LIONION-] and LIONION 2 worked

together in processing the take of the LIFE/LIERODE/MIRAP Installation, now

known as LION. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-I and

2 to LIF2D-22 and 23, respectively.

In the latter part of 1962 the two agents

began the present photographic surveillance operation.

LIONION-1 also acts as & dispatcher

for the LIEMBRACE surveillance teem from which he is compartmented. Dispatching

is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not

LIONION-1 also processes on the premises

all photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping

and mounting.

Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through the

negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of

the agents, that as PBRUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might

be brought upon them by KUBARK through the Mexican goverrment should they get out

Motivation is a combination of financial necessity and violent aversion

to, and determination to bring about the downfall of, the AMIHUG regime.. An

additional notivating factor 1s that both agents actually enjoy what for many would

be monotonous work. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of wori.

Both agents realize that they are working for PBPRIME intelligence; LIONION-1

appears to be aware that he is working for KUBARK.

love nest, is in another

area of town. The Station KURIOr technician,

Hugh I. FRANCOITE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week.

The Case Officer,

Lawrence F. BARKER, meets with him less frequently.

Whereas LIONION-1 knows

the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOITE's true identity.

Security Evaluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican

authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMAVE

area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering

their incode. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flagrante

with the KurTOT automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such

refinement aed complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.

In any evert. LIONION-l has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican

president's office.

This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,

enabled him to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome any

LIONION-1 is known by sight to some PBRUMEN Enbassy staff personnel who have

observed him in the neighborhood. Presumably they believe he is a Mexican. To

avoid operational compromise, he cannot renew his expired passport at the

PBRUMEN Consulate. For this

reason the Station will request KURIOT in separate

correspondence to prepare new passports for both LIONION agents so that they may
