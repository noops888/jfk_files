operation against the PERUVEN Ambassy| inMexisp City.
Objectives. The operation is. Weerehea’ io nish photographic coverege

during daylight hours of the entrances of the target instellaticn, (2)
dispatch paysical surveillance teams against persons associated with the
target, end (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring and
recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

‘The target installation is the PERUMEN Embassy compound (including
Consulate) in Mexico City. The above-listed objectives are accomplished by
two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street from
the target. i

The project is in consonance) with Priority A, Objective 1, of the
current Related Mission Directive) for Mexico.

Background. This proje wivh prasentednfemepproval for the first, tine,
does not represent a bat Valgereats (activity has been going on since
1962 and costs have he! | been charged! to: PERUMEN FI funds. The

operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMEN Enbassy,

both staff and visitors. ish (ppotoerephs are normally reviewed for identi-

fications by the PERUMEN spine He Station, then shown separately to
LEPAMIL-9, and LETAMIL% whd are (penetra ‘agents working inside the target)

They ave subsequently forwarded to the Gi séction of WH/SA where they are shown
to PERUMEN intelligence defectors AMNIP-1 and AMMUG-1. Of those assets to whom
they are routinely shown, LETAMIL;9\nas to date made the largest number of
jdentificetions. The photos have/proven of great value. Within hours of the
arrival of a new Eubassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the
Station, In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos
(accompanied by a log kept by the; LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action
(arrivals and departures) and details of personal associations (who associates
with whom) which are of great value to the Station in moun’ operations against
the target.

i
In addition to photography, .LIONION-1 and LT 2 often called upon
to ao visual surveillance of the target installation end LIONION-1 is esséntial

LIONIGN-1 is a youhs e2 | lawyer GA Qk. He lect PERUMEN in 1960,
planning to continue lille Mexico tothe th States where he resided in
his early years. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer

in the Departuent of Compgree jn! Washing’ jthe other @ police official in <
Tampa, Florida. While Figen s recruited, es LILILY-1, to
perform EERUMEN operati: ‘support si for the Station and, once having
a@ taste of clandestine activity, decided to remain in Mexico. LIONION-2|
was recruited in 1961, as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and
Operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE technical operation aimed at the PERUMEN
Embassy. At this same time LIONION-1 also phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and
the two worked together as a team. In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked
together in processing the take of the LIFEAT/LIERODE/MKTRAP installation, now
known es LICMEN. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-1 and
2@ to LIFSUD-22 and 235, respectively. In the latter part of 1962 the two agents
began the present photographic surveillance operation.

LIONION-1 is the mainstay o: if operation. LIONION-2 acts as his assistent

_ end fill-in at such times as he.ig absent from the ‘observation post. ’ Both serve
principally as observers and photographers. LIONION-1 also acts e8 a dispatcher
for the LIEMBRACE surveillance teem from which he is compartmented. ~ Dispatching
is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not
Imow LIONION-1 or his precise location. LIONION-1 also processes on the premises
all photographic coverage of the main Subassy gate through final printing, cropping
and mounting. Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through the
negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of
the agents, that as PERUMEN refugees they ere vulnerable to pressure which might
‘be brought upon them by KUBARK through the Mexican government should they get out
of line. Motivation is a combination of financial necessity and violent aversion
to, and determination to bring about the downfall of, the AMTHUG regime.. An
additional notivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what. for many would
be monotonous work. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of wo:

PROMI

Coummication is primarily with SIL 3 with LIONION-2 only in his
absence, Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls. (calls
from LIONION-1 go through a telephone cut-out), are usually held at the
LIONION-1 safe apartment. This apartment, which would appear to be a LIONION-1
love nest, is in another area of town. The Station KURIOT technicien, +
Hugh T. FRANCOTTE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week. The Case Officer,
Lawrence FP. BARKER, meets with him less frequently. Whereas LIONION-1 ‘mows
the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOTTE's true identity.

Security Evaluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican
authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMWAVE
area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering
their incone. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flearante
with the KURIO? eutomatic pulse camera on the premises, This camera is of such
refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.
In eny evert, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican
president's office. This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,
enabled him to weather the tex investigation and can be used by him to overcome any

future difficulties with es.

The target installation is aware that photo surveillance is a probability.
On one occesion AMKNOB-1, a JMWAVE asset, was shown a nearby building (not the
LIONION bese) by @ PERUMEN Exbassy officer and told that it was a KUBARK photo
base.

LIONION-1 is kmown by sight to some PERUMEN Enbassy staff personnel who have
observed him in the neighborhood. Presumably they believe he is a Mexican, To
avoid operational compromise, he cannot renew his expired passport at the
PERUMEN Consulate. For this reason the Station will request KURIOT in separate
correspondence to prepare new passports for both LIONION agents so that they may
travel outside Mexico, ~ H .
