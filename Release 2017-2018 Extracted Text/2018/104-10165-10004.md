Robin Moore

: a. Moore bas just returned frow Viet Nes where ke partici-
pated in the combat operations of the Anericau Special Forces iu Viet Naz. after
he had gone throush about eight mnths of trainiuz at the Special Forces chool
at Fort Canphell, Keniucky. Suse understaudins of “oore's personality ray be
entained frou reading au interview hetween hin aud the magazine U.
Korld Report. which was published recently. and copy of which was left with
Waria, Further understandings and ixpressions of Moore may te obtained from
reading his previously published took about Jack Youngblood. an American who
participated iu the events leading to Castro's overthrow of Battista.

b. In my opinion. Moore has a burning desire to be known ;
asa tough, two-fisted. rip roaring soldier of fortune. He bas participated
in real war in Viet Naa, and has received what is probably the best traiuing
in the world for guerilla fighters. uanely. the C. S. Special Forces. Tais
includes training as a parachutist. ie is inclired to braz. and is probably
inclined to intecperate use of alcobul and wuren. ond his judzenent of in-
portant matters is probably irmature. However. be definitely understands

and is experienced in guerilla fizating, is experieuced in nilitary operations,
and eust surely understand military security.

c. He is definitely willing to help, but cannot contribute
cash directly; is willing to furnish the use of the cuest house on bis property
for linited periods of ‘time. is willing to participate aud aid in an operation
to land people on the sczth coast of Cuba, tut is not williuz to comit the ue
ef his property acd facilities as a stagiug area for resupply in the future,

d, Is willing to cone to Miasi, for couferences if his
expenses are paid.

2. Site Evaluation

: a. Blue Hole is an excellent barto:
all weather. and with six feet of waier at iae bar. Is surrounded by very
steep slopes, heavily wooded. Dock facilities are presently very meager,
But could be quickly and easily inproved. No ivei for a boat is avaiiabie
at Blue Hole. aud at Fort Antonio {the closest source). the fuel available
is diese} fuel or automotive gasoline; uo warice white gasoline is available
auywhere ia the area. This is a most significant factor in selecting a
suitable boat.

supplies frog Port Autouio constantly, aud could deliver whatever supplies
were desired, Firearms and explosives are not obtainable on the island. = |
They would have to be smuggled in illegally.

bh, The S.S. Frangeliue sails every two weeks from ‘iiani i

is the Jamaica representative 1 TROJAN boats, at a place called Turtle Cove,
between Port Antonio aud Blue dole.

e. The immigration chief for Jacsica is a nan ty the name.
of George Eubcuks. vio is the former chief of police at Port Antonio: ‘ore
claims that they are very close pereoual friends.

@. Yoore is acquainted with a ran by the name of “ike Hedges,
who is a nephew of Burke Hedges. the t-erican who becaz> Cuba's actassador to
Chile sone years ago. ‘fike lives in Kingston, and, if he is not a Sattista
sympathizer. night prove to be a very valuable connection. The fasily is re-
poried io be quite wealthy, and vould establish an excellent cover.

4. Operational Considerations 3

a. In order to avoid the use of sicnificant names. T
‘ustructed Moore to refer to Manolo as George liinz. and the operatios of
Janding him in Cuba would be referred to as Gperatiouking. The vest likely
acheme seems to be to establish a suitable boat ul blue liole. sith ike cover _
story to be that it belongs to .\serican frieuds of Robin Moore. Housnz is
available locally for a limited ember of Cutans, with Moore being able to
accomodate up to six on his own property. The local boat captain, George
Munroe. could be enployed as captain initially. to. train the Cuban crew io
the local warine conditions, as well as serving a5 au effective cover. In
ny opinion, it will tot be too difficult for persons to enter Jamaica without,
difficulty, provided ihey know a certain pinivum amount of English. H

-

Y think a suitable location could te found for redio i
transaission and reception facilities on the aills surrounding Blue ‘ols. but
this would have to be examined by soreone skilled in radio techniques. ‘ateo

would be excellent. |

Im summary, T would say that Robin Moore aud his property and!
buildings at Blue Hole would servé as an excellent tase of operations. but that
the boat necessary for the operation wuld have to be acquired and equipped
in the states and shipped down there, except for the renote possibility that;
fa suitable boot could be found in Kinston. “1 think a headquarters could be;

tablished at small cost through Yoore's good offices. and I think that Rud
would be a good choice to coordiuate the initial operations there.
