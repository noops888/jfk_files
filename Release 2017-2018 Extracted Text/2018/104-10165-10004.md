lobin Moore

Soore has just returned frow lied las where be partici

pated in the combal operations of the leerican ipecial forces iu Viet lay, alter

he had gone through about eight months of training at the special forces ichool

at Fort Camphell, Rentucky.

ul toore's personality may be

ontained from readire au intervier letween his and the marazine t. ". Yews aud

Gorld Keport. which was published recently, and cop! of which was left with

Laria.

Further understandings and irpressions of loore may be obtained.from

reading his previously publislied took about Jack Youngblood. an erican who

participated iu the erents leading to Castro's o'erthrow of battista.

b.

In my opinion. Moore has a burning desire to be known

as a tough, tro-fisted, rip roarin soldier of fortune.

He bas participated

in real mar in liet Jas, and has receised that is probably the best traiuing

in the world for guerilla fighters. hanely. the t. £. Special Forces.

Tois

includes training as a parachutist. He is ilclived to bray. and is probably

inclined to interperate use of

alcobol and suren. and his judgement of in-

portant matters is probably irmature. However. be definitely understands

and is experienced in guerilla fighting, is experienced in nilitary operations,

and eust surely understand military securit.-

He is definitely willing to belp, but cannot contribute

cash directly; is willing to furnish the use of the guest house on his property

for linited periods of time.

Is willing to participate and aid in au operation

to lane people on the scath coasi of luba, but is not milliur to commit the ue

of his property ard facilities

as a staging area for resuppl: in the future.

d. Is willing to come to liari, for coufereuces if his

expenses are paid.

2. Site Evaluation

Blue lole is an excellent bartor; protected against

all weather. and with six feet of sater at ine har.

steep slopeg,

heavily wooded. Dock faciliries are presently very seager,

rut could be quickly and easil! luproved.

do ivel for a boai is araliabie

at Blue Hole, aud at Fort Antonio (the closest source) the fuel arailable

is diesel fuel or autonotive gasoline; no marice white gasoline is arailable

aurwhere is the area. This is a nost significant factor in selecting a

suitable boat.

The nearest source of food aud other supplies is Port

Autonio; Fred barrett. wanager of the Blue lagoon Club, orders and hauls

supplies fros Port Autorio coustantly, aud could deliver whatever supplies

were desired.

Fireares and explosires are not obtainable on the island.

They would have to be smuggled in illegally.

A small

statiou ragon is available for transportation,

provided expenses are paid by users.

3. Miscellateous. Inforatiou

experienced small boat captain and one who has brought bunts dom frum diant'!

bo.

The S.S. Franzeline sails ever; tro weeks' from Jiami

direct do Port Antonio, and could be employed for the delivery of supplies and

even a loat to lobiu loore.

c. Fred Barre!t, manager of the bar-restaur into seora to

be a sery capable call. and for an additional $10 per meet added

to bis regular

pay. would be quite willing to assist any operation.

d. A Mr. Anthony Gason. a retired Britist arur colonel,

The irmigration chief for Jacaica is a ran to tbe name:

of Georze Eubouls, no is the forer chief of police at Port Antonio: loore

clains that they are very close personal frierde.

who is a nephew of burke Hedges, the Merican sho becar: Cuba's actassador to

Chile scue years ago.

like lives in kingsion, and, if he is not a battista

sympathizer. might prove to be

a rery valuable connection.

The fazilr is re-

ported to be quite wealthy, and would establish an excellent cover.

4. Operational Considerations

In order to aroid the use of significant naves. I

ustrucied loore to refer to l'anolo as George Hing, and the operatios of

landing hin in Cuba sould be referred to as Operatiouning.

Ibe cost likely

scheme seens to be to establish a suitable boat it blue liole. it she cover

story to be that it belongs to erican frieuds of Robin doore.

Housin is

arailable locally for a limited cuber of Cutans, rich loore being able to

accomodate up to sir on his on property.

The local boat captain, leorge

Munroe. could be employed

as captaiu initially. to train the Cuban crer in

the local parine conditions, as rell as serviug as aù effectite corer.

In

my opinion, it will not be

too difficult for persons to enter Jamaica without

difficulty, provided they know a certain ainin amount of English.

I think a suitable location could le found for redio

transission and reception facilities on the billa surrounding Blue tols, but

this would have to be examined by someone akilled in radio lechniques.

would be excellent.

In sumary, I would say that Robin loore and his property and!

building at Blue Hole

would serre as an excellent tage of operations.

but that

the boat necessary for the operation muld hare to be acquired and equipped

in the staces and shipped dora

inere, except for the renote pussibilit; thati

a suitable boat could be found in liuston.

I think a headquarters could be,

established at saall cost through loure's good offices, and I think that Ruds

would be a good choice to coordinate

the initial operatians there.
