how you are going to interpret. It happened in a bus station

rest room. A person was in one of the booths.

Three old-time

Communists came into the rest room talking together about the

death of KENNEDY (one of them was ORDOQUI's driver).

ORDOQUI's

driver was bragging to the others that It was a good thing that

KENNEDY was dead, and that he was not surprised because he (the

driver) knew that KENNEDY had been under observation for over a

month."

2. It is believed that the ORDOQUI mentioned above is

identical with Joaquin Odin Agapito ORDOQUI Mesa (201-20481), a
