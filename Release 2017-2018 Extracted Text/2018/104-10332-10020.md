WORKING PAPER

Notes from meeting w/ ARRB staff Sept. 11, 1995

ARRB Attendees: Marwell, Gunn, Mary + one

CIA Attendees : Barry, Ellie

Issue:

Inconsistency between Mexico City Chrono item

#132 and ARRB document #31

Gunn proposed that the Agency release the information in

document 31 that was released by mistake in the Mexico City

Otherwise, the staff would have to take the

document back to the ARRB for reconsideration which they

felt would undercut the credibility of the CIA and the

staff.

The Board will not uphold a postponement in a

specific document if that information is released by mistake

in another copy of the same document.

Ellie's response - because the information deals with

she will have to take their proposal to a higner

level. [response needed by 16 September]

They also requested a "new" highlighted version of the

Mexico City Chrono which reflects all information released

to NARA in the multiple copies of the Chrono and in the

documents referenced in the Chrono.

Issue:

The three documents of concern.

Marwell said that we could make an addition pitch to the

board to reconsider, but he did not think it would have any

effect on their decision.

PROENZA - Ellie explained that out goal here was to protect

the "asset" not the method and that the deletions could be

reduced to those words that could result in the

identification of the agent.

Marwell

said

that the Board may reconsider based on the need

to protect a

source.

Mary ask who was

the asset? Was it LIRING?

Ellie said she did not know (it could have been some "AM"

source.

Mary ask for more information on LIRING.

but since the

paragraph dealt with Oswald, voted to release. Mary said is

was hard to defend the individual released since she did not

have any information on the person.

We pointed out that the this release impacted on other

documents which dealt with private line taps plus the Board

had not limited its release to the paragraph that mentioned

Oswald but released the name in other calls

which had

nothing to do with Oswald.

Marwell said the Board may re-look at the document as part

of looking at similar documents.

The issue of the taps in other Bloc embassies came up. Mary

said the Board was inclined to release given the end of the

Cold War.

[Note: we will locate as many of the "private line tap"

documents we can for special review]

Issue:

Removing the Proenza and Private line tap

documents form the formal notification list

Marwell clearly prefers not to do it at this time (said they

would discuss).

Has no problem with asking the Board to

reconsider or giving

us the opportunity to presence

additional evidence since their next meeting was within the

30 days set by the law, but felt that the Board was not

inclined to keep tabling documents that they had reached a

decision on.

Marwell asked if the Agency plans to "appeal"; he would like

a heads-up.

Later, in private.

Marwell said that he wanted to build into

the process a loop that would handle these types of

situations.

Issue:

Presentation to Board at Sept. 20/21 meeting

It was agreed that "STATIONS" would be the focus of the

presentation -- 10:00 am, 20 Sept., one hour.

Marwell recommended providing evidence of bilateral

agreements as well as identifying current harm. Said that

the Board was leaning strongly toward releasing stations.

Mary pointed out that there were still issues on the Mexico

City station window. There are documents from the 50g,

references in summaries to the founding of the station and,

most important, the visit by the HSCA

• to Mexico City.

Ellie said there was the possibility of opening windows of

stations when Oswald was present, however, this was a key

issue for the Agency and a senior Directorate/ Agency

decision.

She indicated that the Do would oppose expanding

the Mexico City window

As for the older documents, we pointed out that we had

already agreed to the release of those documents.

Marwell suggest that the 20 Sept. presentation would be a

good opportunity to address the Private Line and other Tel

Taps issue rather than requesting a separate meeting.

(bilateral agreements carry weight); war-stories did not go

over well and neither did Bill McNair. He emphasized the

importance of using the language of the law.

Issue:

Presentation to Board at Sept. 20/21 meeting

It was agreed that "STATIONS" would be the focus of the

presentation -- 10:00 am, 20 Sept., one hour.

Marwell recommended providing evidence of bilateral

agreements as well

as identifying current harm. Said that

the Board was leaning strongly toward releasing stations,

particularly those in Europe.

Mary pointed out that there were still issues on the Mexico

City station window.

There are documents from the 50s,

references in summaries to the founding of the station and,

most important, the visit by the HSCA to Mexico City.

Ellie said there was the possibility of opening windows of

stations when Oswald was present, however, this was a key

issue for the Agency and a senior Directorate/ Agency

decision. She indicated that the DO would oppose expanding

the Mexico City window!

As for the older documents, we pointed out that we had

already agreed to the release of those documents.

Marwell suggest that the 20 Sept. presentation would be a

good opportunity to address the Private Line and other Tel

Taps issue rather than requesting a separate meeting.

After the meeting Marwell elaborated on the presentation.

He said to try to avoid going over old ground (US-Mexico

relationship); when possible provide specific/hard evidence

(bilateral agreements carry weight); war-stories do not go

over well. He emphasized the importance of using the

language of the law especially when citing harm.

He

specifically mentioned Sec. 6. (B) {copy attached) which sets

a standard of "interfere with the conduct of intelligence

activities"

[Note: In a previous

meeting with Gunn, he stressed similar

themes including avoiding

what he called "chicken little"

arguments.

He also raised the question on sensitivity of

acknowledging we had a station in Moscow during the (60s/

"It would have been logical to have one during the Cold

War.

It remains essential that the U.S. Government stand by

JFK Meeting today

After speaking with you tonight about the results of the meeting today, Jeremy Gunn called me and relayed his concerns about the

Board's understandings (or misunderstandings) of ClA's position.

Jand I discussed what happened at the JFK meeting and

the following is our impression of what resulted. Basically

did not commit himself on any specifics on these issues, but expressed

his willingness to cooperate with the Board:

1.

information.

*Station

was more willing to negotiate this one, but does not agree to its release. CIA wants to present more

Dwas not under the impression that this station was to be discussed today so he did not come prepared to present new

information on it. CIA should do this for the Board at the next possible opportunity.

2.

Open Period for Stations

agreed that the staffs of the Board and HRG should work out the exact time period. He had

no problem with the

period and opening it up to.

I the Oswald file. He did not make any firm commitment on the dates to

the Board, saying that the staffs should come to an agreement on this.

3.

Substitutions for

stations - Although

suggested

Station" as a substitution, he clearly prefered

something less revealing like 4L

_European station 1, 2, etc.J". Using the former term has far less plausible deniability. The latter

option basically gives up what we want to protect.

- Once HRG hears from

as to what his understandings are, then someone needs to speak with Jeremy Gunn ASAP on Tuesday

morning before the Board leaves. Jeremy said that unless we correct the Board on its mistaken impression about the above, they will

leave assuming we have come to an agreement and will refuse to revisit this at a latter date.

Let me know if you need me to help out in any way on this. FYl, I will be in meetings at 10AM and 2pm (Win Scott settlement

discussions!!!) tomorrow.

from the Ambassador objecting to the release. She indicated thaf

would be a good candidate to go down to speak with the

Board at their next meeting (what are the dates?) to request that they reconsider. It might also be more persuasive if we could arrange

for a State Department person/

I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this course of action. If we plan on doing this, we need to arrange it with Marwell and then

Release of JFK Documents

1. I understand the JFK AARB is presently considering the

release of documents which would identify CIA stations to the

public. I am opposed in general to revealing the locations of

our stations and would prefer instead to substitute the station

name with a regional designation, e.g. European Station vice

Brussels. I would be willing, however, to open certain stations

during a specific window of time if they are substantively

relevant to the assassination investigation and provided that the

documents in question are sanitized
