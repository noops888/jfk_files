concerning a report which had been received from a Western diplomat alleging —

that the assassination of President Kennedy vas the result of a plot prepared

and executed jointly by the Chinese Commmniste and CASTRO through intermediaries.

Miami office vhich in substance iacppe cane information as that set forth in

(IMHAVEcabie 8658: (IN 75902). advised that the Bureau had during

the night located Robert NIETO, interviewed him, and vag jnforned by him that

Bureau is very much interested in this allegation, 1s endeavoring to run down

the lead releting to the bank in New York, that the Bureau has information

concerning Ramon-B-—-CORTES , born “31. ‘August"1916;‘who-was‘indicted-in-Dalias,

Texas,-in 1960 on-a-charge of impersonating the Honorary Consul of-Guatemale.

He said that this CORTES, “according to” Bureau information, Was in’Mexico City

as.of. August 1962 end-this-Cortes might be considered ‘as ‘possibly being

Adentical with the Ramon B. Cortes mentioned in this matter. ;
2. te Soton stated that the Bureau would like to evaluate this

information if possible and he would guess that this information originated

with someone who had just come out of Hewms and thet this might be some rumor

or something planted by the Soviets to make it rough on the CHICOMS and CASTRO.

porting any such theory. He said that the Bureau was very much interested in

identifying the source and it would appreciate any information ve can give on

where and hov thie diplomat got this information since it would help the Bureau
