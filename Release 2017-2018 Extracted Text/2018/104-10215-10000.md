1. Following Subject’s arrival in Habana on 19 March 1957, he first
contacted AMPHODARCH-3 (on 20 larch) and set up fresh contact arrangements
between AMPHODARCH-3 and cut-out AMANTSLOPE to be initiated following
VAIVADA’s departure for PBPRIYE, On 21 March, VAIVATA contacted the mother
of AMPHODAPCH-10 and was informed that the latter had taken asylum in the
Panamanian Embassy in Habana on 15 March as a result of the attack upon the
Presidential Falace of 13 March, At a personal reeting held in a secure
location with AMPHODARCH-10s mother on that day, the latter asked help in
getting ANFHODARCH-10 into PEPRIME. After consulting with the Station,
VAIVADA told the mother that this would be imprdtical as her son would have
to personally appear in the Consulate to obtain a visa; she was advised to
tell AMPHODARCH-10 to go into exile in Panaza, and fron there to go to Costa
Rica if he so desired under the conditions set out in KKH-A- 3907, dated
4 April 1957, already forwarded to San Jose and to the chief, MHD. At the
Sane tine, VAIVADA forwarded the sun of $100 to AVPHODARCH-10 through his
mother, Tke help afforded AMPHODARCH-10 at this meeting was greatly
appreciated, the agents mother affirming to VAIVADA before their parting
that she felt certain the agent would cooperate with us at any time, Arrange-
nents were wade for the Station to contact the mother independently at any
time this appears necessary,

2, In the evening of 21 Varch, after having telephoned to arrange a
Visit, VAIVADA met with the sister and niece of A'PHODAPCH-1, ‘he Stetion had
determined that VAIVADA should, if possible, broach the problem of payment’ of
the $1000 authorized at that time, describing it as being back salery dua”
AMPHODARCE-1, rather than presenting it as a pay-off since the amount, by
Jocal standards and that of aninsurance policy premium, was small, YATVADA
Was well-received by the family and as a result of the visit believes there is
Ro possibility that the family 1s interested in enbarrassing him, However,
the whole atmosphere and tone of the visit was such that VAIVADA found it

impossible to take up the subject of the money and therefore did not do so,
reporting that he believes a payment will not now be necessary. The Station
: hasn’t noticed any unusual references to the mrder of AMPHODARCH-1 in the

local press since lifting of the censorship. However, about 3 April '
AMPHODARCH-1’s niece again visited the Exbassy and talked to the Citizen

ship Officer, reopening the case of AYPHODARCH-1 and asking whether some~

thing could not be done by the Embassy regarding his murder, when the i
Citizenship Officer, after checking the files, told her that as AYPHODARCH1 :
was not a citizen and therefore he could do nothing about the matter, the +
niece left the Embassy obviously annoyed and disappointed. No further visits :
to the Embassy by AVPHODARCH-1’s facily have come to the attention of the i
Station, and no contact has been made with that family. Efforts are being :
made, with the assistance of the local ODENVY, to identify the killer or i
killers of this agent, for the record,

3. On 9 April 1957, the cut-out AXANTELOPE contacted AMIFHODARCH-3 i
and is now in regular weekly touch with that agent, In addition to a certain
amount of reporting upon student and university events, A!PHODARCH-3’s
principal current task is maintaining contact with AMPHODARCH-6 with a view j
to arranging @ personal meeting between AVANTELOPE and AMPHODARCH-S to enable
the Station to check progress of this operation and strengthen our relation=
ship with the latter, Progress in this effort will be reported,
