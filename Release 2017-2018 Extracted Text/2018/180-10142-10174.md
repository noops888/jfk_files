ent where it is states;

The Department of State has advised the Commission that it has

some information that in 1959 it usually took an American tourist in

Helsinki 1 to 2 weeks to obtain a visa, is and that it has other informa-

tion that the normal waiting period during the past 5 years has been

& week or less. 23g

According to the Department's information, the

waiting period has always varied frequently and videly, with one

confirmed instance in 1963 of a visa routinely issued in less than

24 hours. The Central Intelligence Agency has indicated that visas

during the 1964 tourist season were being granted in about 5 to'i

days. 12a

This information from the Department of State and the Centml

Intelligence Agency thus suggests that Oswald's wait for a visa may

have been shorter than usual but not beyond the range of possible

variation. The prompt issuance of Oswald's visa may have been

merely the result of normal procedures, due in part to the fact that

the summer rush had ended.

It might also mean that Oswald was

unusually urgent in his demands that his visa be issued promptly.

Oswald himself told officials at the American Embassy in Moscow on

October 31, when he appeared to renounce his citizenship, that he had

said nothing to the Soviets about defecting until he arrived in Mos-
