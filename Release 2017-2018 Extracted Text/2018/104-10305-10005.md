Ms. Penelope Grenoble, Editor

Los Angeles Free Press

5850 Hollywood Boulevard

Los Angeles, California 90028

Dear MS. Grenoble:

This letter is in response to the distortions and outright falsities

printed about me in the article written by willam". Turner, titled

"BIANCHURIAN CANDIDATE' LINKED TO JFK ASSASSINATION PROBE,

which appeared in the July 25-31 edition of the Los Angeles Free Press

I request that the Free Press either print a retraction of such lies

and distortions or publish this letter.

Mr. Turner'to me.

who spent ten years as a Special Agent of the FBI, is not

unfamiliar

He has authored similar articles, both during my

imprisonment in the United States and while I was detained in the

German Democratic Republic, in which he knowingly and purposefully

words in my mouth and misquoting his sources of information to lend

credence to his major untruths, a skill he probably developed snile

serving with the Bureau's intelligence-security division. His recent

claims cause me to wonder whether or not he ever left the FBI.

Professor Richard H. Popkin, from whom Mr. Turner obviously collected

much of his latest baloney, is a character that I feel should either

purchase a hearing aid or

consult a psychiatrist.

Each of my. so

called discussions with him (all but one occurred over the telephone)

were duly tape-recorded by me, and if he did in facy assert what Mr.

Turner has attributed to him about me, then he too is a liar.

I am listing the following facts in rebuttal to the lumer-Popkin

fable:

The "papers" that I "carried" when arrested did not snow me to be a

"decorated hero of the Korean War," nor did they reyéal anything

about "a career in Army intelligence.".. More to the point, the docu

months I was not even permitted to read a newspaper), not to mention

the curtailment of my most basic constitutional safeguards.

nor were they effected for the purpose of establishing rapport.

After my acquittal (in 1968, not in 1967) I did not "drop from sight, "

as Nr. Turner, the FBI and the CIA damn well, know.

I have never stated to anybody, either verbally or in writing, that

in 1963 I was an agent for the CIA, although in 1974 I did state,

under oath

that I thought I had been functioning for the CIA during

she the

Mr. Turner is also aware that less than two months

after President Kennedy's death FBI agents confronted me with their

suspicion that I had "acted as an unregistered agent for a foreign

power," inferring that I was a spy for one of the Cuban intelligence

services (several years later the CIA, through one of its "former"

case officers, accused me of having been a Soviet spy, still later,

one FBI agent suggested that I had worked for the Chinese).

The registered letter that was dispatched at my instance to FBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover in September 1963 (not necessarily on the

13th) revealed sufficient details to warrant an immediate investiga

tion (if not the arrest) of Lee Harvey Oswald and two Cuban refugees.

I certainly "assumed" that some "action" would be taken by the FBI.

I was not the least bit "frantic" about anything in September 1963°

I did not set foot inside the Republic of Cuba during that month:

To my knowleäge I have never talked to any "Castro aides.":

The main

distinction between some American intelligence officers that I knew

and hired killers were the procedures utilized in murdering their

victims and/or the methods used to disassociate themselves and the

U.S. government from their crimes.

I had no fear of being implicated "in the planned assassination" at

the time of my arrest or prior thereto.

The two letters that

I mailed to James L. Rankin, General Counsel to

the Warren Commission, were not sent through "private channels."

They

were sent through proper jail authority.

I have never claimed that I "squirreled away a snapshot of (myself)

with Lee Harvey Oswald taken in Jackson Square in New Orleans in 1963.

I have never stated that I am "willing to surface and tell (any) story

to Congress" or to anybody. And I did not reveal any details about

Mr. Oswald to Professor Popkin that are "new" or unknown to the FBI.

W. TURNER

OS INDICES RESULTS:

the time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September

1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured.

by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency

employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these

names in his possession.

It was concluded that while NAGELL is unguestionably

unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted

by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington,

D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October

1962. His file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these

are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints

stemming foom the plare crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965

made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this

security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL, be personally

Interviewed by a representative

how he came dato the possession these names but no further action is indicated

in his file and this interview was not undertaken:

DELAITS:

Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964

when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested

for bank robbery.

The RAMPARIS claim that he received intelligence training after the plane....

crash is true. The crash occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from

Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He

served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U.S. Army Counterintelligence

Corps, terminating about 1958. A It. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with

NAGELI personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and

that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane

crash.

The RAMPARIS article's claim that NAGElL said he fired the gun in the

bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination

took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELI made on

1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of

The RAMPARTS article's allegation that the FBI took from NAGPIL a note-

book containing the names of CIA employees is true.

NAGELL's complaint that he was "salted away" is open to speculation. A

Asked FBI in Miami if his Cuban or Russian sources

gave him a pistol with silencer and microfilm i he

would be permitted to return same to his contact so

he could be of further use to U.S. Government. He

stated that in August or September 1962 he met a man

from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to

individuals whom hebelieved may have been Soviet Agent.

Advised EBI in Los Angeles, California, that he had

taken his former wife to court for failure to comply with

court order giving NAGELL visitation rights with children.

NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was re-

ferred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His

condition was diagnosed as'depression, tearful, nervous,

rigid". Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".

NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of at-

tempting to rob State National Bank. Slashed

wrist night

of 9/20/63- NAGELI, consistently denied he had tried

to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots

in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to bit anyone,

He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have

been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to

Cuba!'.

A notebook which the Subject had on his person when ar-

rested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee,

the names of purported CIA agents and other information.

Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him

that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge,

decided everything against him in Lös Angeles and made

arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to

pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and

eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELI reportedly

attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but

lost nerve.

(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance

of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles,

California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affi-

davit that his passport had been lost of stolen. He was

issued a new passport on 6 August 1963. )

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told

U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up

the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELI

told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank.

I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time. "

Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed

acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD

"on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledge of NAGELL.

NAGELL furnished a signed statement:

"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a

representative of a foreign government preposed to me

that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal

offense and inimical to the best interest of the United

States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May

1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-

ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I

agreed to such a proposal. "

"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,

known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government;

that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned

act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid

proposal.

Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this

same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be

"disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-

upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,

although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation

actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I

was arrested and am presently charged.

I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that

my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary,

solution to the problem with which I was confronted.

I am not guilty as charged.!

NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for

bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the

purpose of psychiatric examination.

Sentenced in U.S. District Court, El Paso, Texas to

serve 10 years.

NAGELL swallowed several sleeping pills while lodged

at the El Paso County Jail.

going to have to go back to Russia to

buy a car" (Report, p. 320);

Given a lie detector test by the FBI,

Bogurd's responses were those "normally

expected of a person telling the truth."

Nevertheless, the Warren Commission

dismissed the incident by noting that

Oswald supposedly could not operate an

automobile and that on November 9 he

nllegedly spent the day drafting a

lengthy letter to the Soviet Embussy, It

evidently never considered the possibility

somcone might be impersonating Os-

wald. But Bogard will never identify the

impersonator. He stuck to his story in

news interviews, and subsequently was

beaten to within an inch of his life by an

unknown assailant and arrested by the

Dallas police on seemingly trumped-up

bad check charges. He retreated to his

native Louisiana, where on St. Valen-

tine's Day 1966, he was found dead of

exinust fumes in his automobile.

The muin ingredients of the patsy

theory are wrapped up in a story that has

gradually filtered out of Lcavenworth

Penitentiary. The story is that of inmate

Richard Case Nagell, and paradoxically,

the most cogent confirmation for it is the

manner in which he wound up sentenced

to ten years in federal custody:

Nagell was a highly decorated infantry

captain in the Korcan War who, he

claims, subsequently became a CIA

ngent. It is a matter of record that in

1957 he was seriously injured in a plunc

crash in Cambodin, which tends to supe

port his contention, since Combodin was

not exactly a tourist playground. On

September 20, 1963, Nogell wulked into

a bank in El Paso, Texus, fired a gun into:,

the cciling, and then sat outside waiting

to be arrested. He says he staged the

affair because he wanted to be in custody

as an alibi when the assassination took

place. It was a desperate measure, he ad-

mits. But he had sent a registered letter

to J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the

impending assassination, which he says.

was then scheduled for the latter part of

September (probably the 26th in Wash-

ington, D.C.), and the letter had song

unanswered,

There is an incredibly brief FBI inter-

view report stating, in part, that on De-

cember 19, 1963, Nagell advised, "For

the record he would like to say that his

association with OSWALD (meaning

LEE HARVEY OSWALD) was purely

social and that he had met him in Mexico

City and in Texas"' (CD 197). Another

repo states that when the prisoner was

being led from court on January 24,

1964, he "made wild accusations to news-

paper reporters, accusing the FBI of not.

attempting to prevent the assassination

of President Kennedy. " (CD 404).

That the charges may not be so wild is

indicated by the fnet that the government

threw the book nt Nagell, a first oftender

who says he expected to be charged only

with discharging a firearm on govern-

ment-protected property, Since his sen-

tencing, he has been shuttled between

Leavenworth and the federal medical

center (a euphemism for mental institu-

tion) at Springfield, Missouri. While the

government has suggested in court that

his airplane crash mentally affected

Nagell, the fast remains that he was

given intelligence training after the crash.

What Nagell alleges is damning not only

to the FBI, but to the CIA. In brief,

he says that the motive for the assassina-

tion was Kennedy's move in the direction

of a rapprochement with Castro, which

was tank betrayal. in the eyes, of

anti-Castro elements. As he puts it, an

anti-Castro group in New Orlans und

Mexico City, code name Bravo Club,

decided to give Kennedy a "Christmas

present" to be delivered September 26, a

date that was postponed. A party was

required. Two members of Bravo Club

approached Oswald while he was work,

ing at the Reily colfee firm in New Ore:

leans in the summer of 1963, and ap-

pealed to his ego in setting him up as the

patsy. When the "delivery" site was

shifted to Dallas, Bravo Club enlisted

the aid of a Dallas "subsidiary," Deltu

Club.

Meanwhile the CIA got wind of the

plans and sent several agents into the

field to ascertain whether they were " for

real." Nagell says he was one of the

agents dispatched. Within a short time,

he claims, he was pulled in. It had been

verified that the plans were authentic,

that "gusanos (anti-Castroites]

were

making the watch tick," and that the

sum of the plot was right-wing in nature.

Nagell says that he was instructed to

"arrow" the patsy, that is kill him, after

the assassination. At this point, he con-

tends, he got cold fect and bailed out. "I

would rather be arrested than commit

murder and treason," he declared in a

self-prepared petition for habeas corpus.

In the petition, Magell asserts that he

used the pseudonyms Robert Nolan and

Joseph Kramer in the U.S. and three

foreign countries under the authorization

of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He

states that the files of the FBI and the

CIA contain information that Oswald

was using the aliases Albert Hidel and

Aleksei Hidel. He charges that the FBI

illegally seized from him evidence crucial

to his defense, such us notebooks con-

tnining the names of certoin CIA eme

ployces, photographs, two Mexican

tourist cards (one in the name Joseph

Kramer, the other in the name Albert

Hidel), and receipts for registered mail,

including the one for the letter sent

Hoover warning of the assnssination.

When Nagell complains he has been

"salted away" because of what he

knows, he just might be making the un-

derstatement of the year.

[THE ELIMINATION OF A PATSY]

"TI DIDN'T KILL ANYHODY... I'm just

a patsy," Oswald shouted to ncws-

- men while in police custody. A

marked patsy, contends Garrison-one

who was not supposed to have lived long

enough to utter his cry of innocence. But

something had misfired, and Oswald fell

not into the hands of his would-be exe"

cutioners, but into the comparative

safety of the Dallas jail. The denouement

presented a crisis that the conspirators

could solve only by pressing police buff

Jack Ruby into service.

Although the Warren Commission

concluded that Oswald ducked into his

Oak Cliff rooming house to pick up the

.38 revolver, later confiscated from him

in the Texas Theater, it did not explain

why, if he hnd gone to work at the School

Book Depository that morning intend-

ing to kill the President and escape,

he did not take the revolver with him

That he made a beeline to his rooming

house for the sole purpose of getting the

A revolver speaks of a man who desper-

ately wanted to protect himself from

treacherous comrades rather than from

the police. Notwithstanding the mild re-

sistance he put up in his refuge in the

Texas Theater, Oswald's demeanor in

custody gave every indication that he

would resolve the great riddle- given

the time.

Oswald does not opper to be the only

double-cross victim of that bloody after-

noon: the evidence is persuasive that

someone other than the accused assassin

killed Officer J. D. Tippit, a friend of

Jack Ruby, whose patrol area included

the Harlandale Street section headquar

Washington, D.C.

An editor of a trade journal, whom I first net while on

an intelligence assignment in Latin America,

has urged me

for some time to make public the facts dealing with my

involvement in

conspiracy. to

murder

the late Chief

Executive, John F. Kennedy, in 1963 and the circumstances

surrounding. my arrest and imprisonment in the. United States

and East. Germany•

For reasons that are more personal

than

advisable I can think of little else that I would like to do

better.

Pit with the copious amount of documentation and

background material on hand, that I feel should be adduced

to in any valid treatise of. the subject, it would require

writing no less than a tome, an undertaking for which I am

hardly qualified.

Then, too, there is a growing. skepticism

on my part concerning the kind of reception that a topic of

thia sort would elicit from a society long since inured to

violence, corruption and injustice. Still, after ovor six

roars of relativo silence, I'vo decided that I must say

something about all this, if only to answer the lies and

distortions concocted about me in the press.: Thus,

I have

compiled this

small booklet, a throwaway,: which

may be

VINADIAS FAMILI

ariicie

nare not sought in reinis oi

confirn each and every

assertion made by its

author,. Thomas C. Lucey.

tro Lucey, despite

his citing a substantial number of inaccuracies,

has nonetheless depicted

a vast area of

what may be termed the

fundamental truth.

With this in mind, I have tried

to set the

record straight only insofar as it pertains

to those inaccuracies - and omissions

- which in my opinion reflect adversely on the whole.

In order

to view Mr. Lucey's account in a sonewhat different perspective, I shall

begin by

advising

earlier than Aupust 1962.

that I firet went to work for the Central latelligence Agency Case

It was during the winter of 1955-56, while assigned

Review Officer with the Counter Intelligence Corps at Los Angeles,

that I was initially

recruited into the CIA's farflung notwork of informants and agents, one of a number.

suppose, within the Defense Department's intelligence

community who helped the Agency

keep an oye on its not always tame competitor.

My recruitment was. handled by a Herbert

Loibacher, an agent of the CIA's Los Angeles office, and a Joe DaVanon, later identified

to me through photographs. as an

official from CIA headquerters,

then located

on

street in Washington, D.C.:

Motivated by a degree of naivete and the Agency's subtle

reminders that I owed a greater duty. to my country than to the military establishment,

served aB

a: non-paid,

confidential informant off and on until my resination from

Army in October 1959.

A complete description of the information I supplied to the Agency

during my military career would only add to what must perforce become a lengthy addendum;

suffice to say that it did not always

seen gerrane to intelligence affairs,

when it did it consisted mainly of an assortment of data that for so-called discretionary

roasons was seldom passed on to the agency. for for that matter, to our own higher

echelone) through regular channels.

Mr. Lucey'&

statement, "Being marriod 'to a foreign national meant an automatic

removal from

incorrect

intelligence

work so Nagell decided to leave the Army,* is misleading land

in its

entirety.

The only military intelligence organization from which an

individual is

normally removed subsequent to marrying a foreign national is the cic -

primarily a security type orgen and this rule does not necessarily apply when the agent

officer.

• As a commissioned officer,

I was declared

ineligible for further duty with the CIC effective 14 April 1959,

a full year after my

morriage to a foreign national. I was not barred from assignment to other, even more

sonsitive,

organizations such as Field Operations' Intelligence, then the clandestine

espionage department of military intelligence. As for the reasons I left the Army, they

were clearly if euphemistically explained

in my second letter of resignation,

dated

31 August 1959, namely:

"I desire to tender my resignation because I wish to further my

civilian education:

It is not possible for me to pursue the curriculum of which I am"?

desirous while

active duty.

Also, compassionate reasons of a personal nature exist

for desiring to tender my resignation at this time."

My patronege under the CIA did not end with my discharge from the Army and ensuing

employment in

December 1959

as an investigator for the State of California;

in fact,

henceforth I was offered remuneration for my services, however nominal it sometimes was.

What

my

new..tasks. comprised is.of

no real pertinence to this addendum or to later

developments,

except

perhaps

to mention that one of my contacts said he worked out of

"Domestic Intellifence," possibly the forerunner of the present-day Domestic Operations

Division,

which

illegally keeps tabs on a wide range of American civilian orgonizations

and activities.

•I.

should also point out that I did not quit my position with the State

of California

"to work for the CIA, "

as implied by Mr. Lucey. I was dismissed, in June

1962, at my own option and in my opinion for

doing my job.

(The following month I was

shot through the right chest

during an altercation with a person whose identity I have

never

disclosed

Rolando Masferrer;

inquired

into an allegation that Marina Oswald intended to divorce

and I performed courier duties and acted

as a cut-out.

of my arrest I was operating in an undercover role,

having

become involved in a domestic-inspired plot to

assassinate President Kennedy and,

leastwise ostensibly, other highly-placed government officials.

Mr. Lucey goes on to state that my last assignment at the time "was to penetrate the

Fair Play for Cuba Committee, where he mot Oswald. "

Such statement is also incorrect. I

was never a member,

bona-fide or otherwise, of the FPCC.

And my conversationg

with FPCC

Steve Roberta, an official

Angeles,

could hardly be construed as a penetration.

Furthermore, I had been introduced

under an assumed name.

therefore I couldn't: kill Mr.

it was

• similar sounding argument, ultimately reduced to a

threat,

that was advanced to me by Robert Graham as an incentive to dispose of Mr. Oswald

in September 1963

But my refusal to do so had absolutely

no bearing on the reason for

offecting my arreat in the manner I chose, nor did it engender in me foar of reprimal by

the CIA.

Texas, which the official

sworn to and subscribed before Willian R. Martin (a former member

of the CIA's Dirty Tricks Division, who by his own admission is still in "the reserves").

But I shall opine that if President Kennedy had not met his demise when and where he did,

I would not have been brought to trial

on charges of commiting a felony.

While my roturn to the fold of the CIA in May 1968 may have been the only "practical

thing" for me to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, as a few

old bank account passbooks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary that Mr. Lucey

has portrayed). Nor was it because of any peculiar allegiance to those who had tossed me

on the scrap heap for the sake of expediency 4t years earlier, love of country, masochis-

tic tendencies. or wont of further intrigue.. And while

it remains axiomatic in my mind

the solo requisite

for one's use by the Agency is his qualification to fit into

whatever

may happen

to be. the scheme of things,

this did not apply in my

circumstance, not really.

I agreed to go back. out into the cold; so to speak, strictly

for personal reasons and I think the explanation is wisely left at that for now.

My mission inside East Germany - if indeed it was a mission - was neithor as well-

defined nor as elementary an lr. Lucey has perceived.

sure the CIA knows all 1t

neede to know about American defectors in Berlin and the modus operandi of the urs.

In

the mission was not directed against East Germany, per se.

Preparations bore the

trademarke of an authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the main to another

nation.

policies of its government.

activities hositle to

socialist states,

to which - as an integral part of my

cover - I freely confessed.

Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely had neglected

to tell me during the briefings that these previous activities constituted a violation of

the criminal statutes of the GDR,

warranting a

maximum penalty of death upon conviction.

By inadvertence or by plan I found myself in a not altogether unfamiliar predicament.

I had confessed to my real mission, assuming that it was genuine, without doubt I would

have been spared execution,

probably even escaped long-term imprisonment.

Instead, I

As

Nith regard to my marital status and my children, the

appears to have exploited,

the incentive for accepting the assignment in the GDR.

My accusations in this respect

contered around my children and

they were leveled at the State Department as the result

Since returning to the

REF:

State Dept. Airgram No. 'A-903 from Berlin - Subject: Psychiatrist's

Report on Richard Case NAGHI, U. S. Citizen Released by GDR

Reference airgram furnishes background information on Subject and

f1lls In gaps In the chronology of events in Subject's Iife of Interest

to the Agency. Of particular note is the fact that Subject was acquitted

on 29 April 1968 after his claim of temporary insanity at the time of

the crime found support in the expert testimony of a noted American

neurologist, DI. Edwin WEINSIEIN. An article In the January 1968 issue

of RAMPARIS by William W. TURNER implied that NAGHLI had been involved

In the assassination plot against President KENNEDY and that he had been

"salted away". Subject denied any Involvement in any conspiracy and denied

that he had any Information of use to GARRISON. Subject alleged that his

fear that the CIA might try to "eliminate" him was planted in his mind by

Mr. GARRISON. (See page 2 of Interview report). On page 3 of the interview

report Subject states he no longer believes that it 1s realistic to think that the

CIA was trying to k111 him.

George R. BABINEAU, Cpt., MC, the psychiatrist at the U. S. Army Hospital,

Berlin Who interviewed Subject, was granted a continuing liaison clearance.

on 17 October 1968 at the request of DDP/E/G/IS.

WINSEIN was security approved as a continuing contact-

through SECRET for the Medical Staff on 13 July 1965. WEINSIEIN is with the

associated with East Berlin attorney, Wolfgang VOGHl, and West Berlin

attorney, Juergen STANCE, in a number of cases involving the release

of Americans from East Germany•

According to an FBI report dated 3

February 1967 these releases usually Involved the payment of specified

of a foreign government to comply with an agreement made in May 1963

Attorney Jim Carrion. He said that Garrison had warned him that he

19. On 7 September 1968 another William Turner plece was

printed by Ramparte under the heading " & Ascarelnatione / Epstein's

11. On 25 October 1968 the Washington Post reported that after...

holding Nagell for four months, the Last Germane had releaned him

SIRHAN'S MOTIVES

Unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan

has lived ad tell of his morivarions- but he

has chosen so remain silen. The onlyother

porential. source of infilmation is lils

Jumile which hail mor spoken to the press.

Muhmused Abiled-Headl, 88

Egyptian

correspondent for Akhbar Elyoum in

Cairo, recently guined access 8o Sirhan's

Jamily. Based upon information supplied

him by the family, he has written exclusiv-

els for Ramparts the following account

of Sirhan's motivations and the sirategy

he plans for his trial.

Because of the forthcoming trial and

the difficuly of dealing with this subject

without emotional involvement, the editors

oJ RAMPaRTs have elected in present this

information of historic interest to our

readers without display, and in as ob-

jective a form as possible.

ECAUSE I AM AN ARAN I was able to

break through the burrier of sus

picion thur had stopped other

journalists cold and obtain the first in-

depth interviews the Sirhan family has

given since the assassination. From their

comments and from what Sirhan has said

to them, a picture of the man and his

motives begins to emerge, replacing the

misleading portraits which haveswamped

the U.S. press.

The fact that Sirhan has not publicly

discussed his trial is no accident. It is his

own strategy. something he developed

after thinking about it for long hours in

his specially made jail cell. In fact, he

has confided to his lanly that he will

Thu he wi

never make en statement unless special

provisions are made for the courtroom

procecdings.

What Sirhan wants is,

quite simply, publicity. He wants the

major television networks to be allowed

to broadcast the entire trial. If they do

this, he says, he will tell all. "And if they

refuse?" his brother Adel recently asked

him. "Then I shall go to the gas chamber

-silent," Sirhan replied.

To understand why Sirhan is indeed

College educated, articulate and a

RAMPARTI

Assassinations}-

voracious reader, Sirhan is confident

about his own ability to cope with his

predicament. His eldest brother, Shereif,

told me that Sirhan studies the intrica-.

cies of his case as mnny as ten hours a

day in his cell. Shercif recalls that Sirhan

recently said to him, "I do not need a

lawyer. I understand my case und know

how to defend myself."' But even so,

Attorney Russell Parsons is defending

his client, and doing it on Sirhan's own

grounds. "The main issue," Parsons told

me, "is to answer this question: why, for

what reason, did Sirhan kill Robert

Kennedy? There are 100 witnesses who

saw Sirhan shooting Mr. Kennedy, but

no one seems to know why he did it."

Sirhan and his attorney hope that the

defense-presuming that the television

networks are allowed into the court-

room-will show that Sirhan did not

have "malice aforethought" in shoot-

ing Kennedy because the act was a polit-

ical gesture, and that Kennedy, to Sirhan

at least,

was merely a symbol. His

brother Adel notes that "if Sirhan was

just an assassin, he could have done it in

another way, just by having a gun with a

telescope. He went to the Ambassador

Hotel expecting to get caught; that is

why he left his notes at home. I believe

that Sirhan wanted to get caught so that

he could say what he believes."

THEN I FIRST TRIED to meet with

the Sirhan family, I was re-

- fused. Security is extremely

heavy around them, and they are under-

standably wary of new faces. Later, when

I finally obtained an invitation to mect

with them, Mrs. Sirhan apologized, I

believe for having been inhospitable to

a fellow Arab.

This family, which fled Jordan to seek

greater safety and security than it had

known, is now living in terror. They are

somewhat at a loss to understand the

events which have suddenly catapulted

them into history. None of the four

brothers goes to hisjob; they all feel that

death follows them everywhere, and they

move carefully, with a heavy guard.

"Why don't you just leave this country?"

lushed Shereil, "Whore shull we go?"

he answered. "To. whom shall we lenve

our brother? Our land is under Isruel's

occupation." Shereif clarifed his state-

ment: "Our brother is in jail; we have to

stay."

11968.

I sensed not only the Sirhans' con-

fusion, but also some bitterness. They

have notreceived any aid from the Arab

countries, as they originally thought they

might. Parsons is also somewhat sur-

prised; he had hoped that the various

locni Arab consulates would help defruy

court costs, i

Indeed, Los Angeles' Jordanian con-

sul, who visited Sirhan in jail at Sirhan's

request, indicated to me that the accused

assassin hadjexpected the Arab people

to treat him as a hero. However, except

for some Palestinian extremists, his act

has been universally repudiated by the

Arab world. One Arab newspaper has

said editorially,

"We don't feel any

responsibility for this. It is the society

that fed him with hostility, the society

that gave him the gun, that is responsi-

ble." Members of the Arab Students®

Association, of which Sirhan was once

an officer, feel that the killing of Kennedy

was a terrible mistake. One of them said

to mc,

"What are we going to do with

the rest of the American candidates? Kill

them all because they want lo help

Israel!"

Still, the Sirhans' friends are primarily

Arab, and they live in an atmosphere

that is more: Arab than American. The

entire family spent a good deal of time

discussing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The

mother says that Sirhan was the most

sensitive and the most involved during

these discussions. Adel says that Sirhan

once saw a television report of Robert

Kennedy addressing the members of the

Nevch Shalom Temple in Portland,

Oregon. While in the synagogue, Ken-

nedy, wearing i yarmulke, declared that

the United States must help Israel

against aggression from whatever source.

""Unlike the South Vietnamese,"' Ken-

nedy said, "the Israelis have shown they

are willing to fight for their own survival.

Indeed, Israel is the very opposite of

Vietnam: the Israeli government is very

democratic, effective and free of corrup-

tion. Its people are united in its support."

The senator then urged the Johnson Ad-

ministration to procred mt oner with the

sale of 50 Phantom jet lighters los the

lornell Air Force and do on oll economis

aid lo the Arile countries. This whole

episode made Sichan very mogy, Shereif

recalls. "He left the room putting his

hands on his ears and alinost weeping."

I asked Sirhan's mother why

she

thought her son had shot Kennedy.

"Everything in this country was helping

Sirhan," she maintained. "It was push-

ing him to the danger point. Everything,

the propaganda of the Zionists, every-

thing, was against his country, against

his people."

Adel described Sirhan's current state

of mind: "He feels he has done a terrible

thing, but he feels now it is too late to be

sorry. Now he wants Americans to listen

to something they have never listened

10."

And at their first meeting in the jail,

Sirhan's mother said to him, "Shame on

you. Why have you done such a thing?"

He replied, "Il's 800 lase lo speak of it..

But all the Americans will know why."

ings of the Commission and laid bare the

tortured logic it finally employed to dis-

pel riotions of a conspiracy.

Both books became best sellers, but

their authors have since gone different

wilvs. Lane, who shuttered his Inw prac-

lice and struggled for yours to get his

manuscrip published in the United

States (ie was first published in Britain),

has stumped the country in support of

District Altorney Jim Garrison's theory

that the assassination was carried out by

no anti-Castro paramilitary team super-

11.19.

vised by persons with cia affiliations.

Epstein, whose book was a converted

Cornell University master's thesis-the

subject was urged upon him by his men-

tor, Andrew Hacker-has emerged as

one of Garrison's most fervid accusers.

His vehicle is The New Yorker: in the

issue of July 13, he delivered a 25,000-

word blast at Garrison, calling the DA's

investigation a fraud.

The New Yorker article had its genesis

over a year ago, when the author showed

up at Garrison's office in New Orleans.

According to Chief Investigator Louis

Ivon, Epstein spent about 48 hours in

town, some three hours at the office, and

hasn't been seen since. Much of what he

writes about has occurred since this

touch-and-go visit and is obviously hear-

say on his part, yet he writes with the

authoritative tone of a participant. Un-

doubtedly this technique is convincing

to his audience, which assumedly is un-

at ent

familiar with the intricacies of Garrison's

investigation. But to those familiar with

the facts, the article is badly slanted.

For example, Philosophy Professor

Richard. Popkin of the University. of

California at San Diego, author of the

•book The Second Oswald (propounding

the theory of an Oswald double) and

"Garrison's Case"' in The New York

Review of Books (September 14, 1967),

recently commented on the article:

"I found it a queer mix of facts, half-

facts, rumors and very dubious informa-

tion from people hostile to Garrison.

Epstein has compressed all this to make

it look like everything's on the same

level. I think it would take an awful lot

of work to disentangle what he's saying

on almost any page as to how much of

it has a factual base, how much of it is

rumor that he has heard from people,

how much of it are charges that have

been made by people like [William] Gur-

vich [who volunteered to work on the

investigation without pay, passed him-

self off as the Chief Investigator, then

turned on Garrison] against Garrison,

which haven't been substantiated any-

where except by Gurvich's statement of

them. And also that he tends to take

facts and information and rumors and so

on, that occurred over a year and a half's

period, and compress them all into

simultaneous events, so that a statement

made by Garrison at one time is

pounced upon on the basis of informu-

tion or statements he mude & year und a

half later in a totally dilferent context.

So 1 think il's a quite unlis presenta-

tion, which has some factual base, but

which also has a lot of very dubious

elements in it."?

One of the dubious elements is Ep-

stein's version of the testimony of Dean

Andrews Jr., a colorful attorney who

numbers among his former clients Os-

wald (who wanted his undesirable dis

charge from the Marine Corps rectified)

and the late David William Ferrie, a

central figure in the Garrison investiga-

tion. The day after the assassination,

Andrews told the Commission he re-

ceived a phone call from a man he knew.

as Clay Bertrand, whom he described as

a "lawyer without a briefcase" for local

homosexuals. Bertrand asked him to go

to Dallas and defend Oswald. Garrison

contends Bertrand is Clay Shaw, whom

he has charged with conspiracy.

According, to Epstein, Andrews ini-

tially gave the Fut "several different de-

scriptions" of Bertrand, and finally ad-

mitted that Bertrand "was merely a

figment of his imagination." Later, be-

fore the Commission, Andrews stated

that he had recently seen Bertrand in a

bar and, Epstein says, described him as

"a boy" who was "five feet eight inches"

and had "sandy hair." "No other clues

to Bertrand's identity turned up, how.

ever," writes: Epstein, "and Wesley J.

Liebeler, a Commission lawyer who con-

ducted the investigation in this arca, said

he was convinced that no such person

An objective reading of "Andrews

testimony, however, reveals that he

told the FBi that Bertrand was"approxi-

mately six feet one inch to six feet two

inches in height, brown hair, and well

dressed" a description that closely

matches the tall, aristocratic Shaw. As

for Bertrand being a figment of his

imagination, Andrews declared, "That's

what the Feebees [FBi] put on." He re-

counted that G-men had pestered him

to the point where he told them, "Write

what you want, that I am nuts. I don't

care." As for his later remark to the

Commission's Mr. Liebeler that Ber-

trand was only five feet, eight inches,

Andrews explained that "this time I was

looking for the fellow, he was sitting

down." Nöwhere does he refer to Bern

trand as a "boy." Epstein was perhaps

confused by his exclamation: "I don"t

play Boy Scout and measure them."

In his superficial examination of Our-

check the police records prepared upon

Shaw's arrest. Thoroughly shaken by the

arrest. Shaw blurted out, according to

Patrolman Aloysius Habighorst, that he

episode, he was "an inmate of a federal

institution for the criminally insane in

Springfield, Missouri.". As he does so

he could not say and remain faithful to

That the businessman had retracted

proved to be accurate;

That the justice could not answer

questions concerning his judicial opin-

ions since the Constitution specifies that

members of Congress may not be ques

That despite this asserted Constitu-

tional bar, the justice pointed to his dis-

senting vote against extending the one-

man-one-vote principle to local govern-

ment as proof of his devotion to State's

rights;

That although he had been at the

President's disposal as advisor-summar-

izer, he had never been involved in dis-

cussions that could conceivably reach

the Court;

That the issucs under discussion at the

top level mcetings hond ranged from loc

Vietnam War to riots in the cities;

That the justice had voted to jail druft

card burners and had voted ugainst

taking up for consideration the legality

of the war;

That he voted to give the police sweep-

ing rights to stop-and-frisk suspects on

training after his recovery, indicating

that he had no permanent brain injury.

Moreover, the fact that he stood trial

implies that he was legally sane. Re-

cently, he was released from Leaven-

Springfield only temporarily.

The publication of the lipstein article

came at an opportune line for Clay

Shaw. Obtaining advance copies, his al-

torneys entered it as evidence before a

three-judge federal panel which was hear-

Reference cables concern the claim of an individual appearing at

the Consul General's office in Zurich, Saitzerland on 4 June 1968 that

he is one Richard Case NAGNET. NAGILI was sentenced to a 10 year term for

bank robbery on 9 June 1964 and is supposedly in a federal prison in Missouri.

GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness in his investigation

according to a news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January

1968. The clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached.

file also contains a copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 prepared

in research on the GARRISON CASE.

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to

ascertain from the FBI if Subject is still in préson.

I did not receive reference IN Cable 25955 initially. Attached is

Mobley's Report:

Garrison Case

Can We Afford

Not to Listen?

BY JACK MABLEY

THE INVESTIGATION INTO the assassination of Presi-

dent kennedy is being reopened. It is being conducted by a

prosecutor: with the power of subpena and a grand jury

with the power to indict.

It would be better for the country

if the fodoral government were mak-

ing the investigation rather than a

New Orleans official who has been

accused of beingunstable and of

seeking headlines:

However, the federal government

shows no signs of wanting to reopen

the matter, and the prosecutor, Jim

Garrison, appears to be quite insistent

on carrying it thru.

*A number of writers and self-

appointed investigators also are dis-

satisfied with conflicting facts and

unanswered questions, and they con-

tinue. to publish evidence to rebut the

JIA. GARRISON

Warren commission conclusion that

Lee taryey Oswald alone was invplved in the assassination.

ONE OF THE MOST persistent critics of the Warren

conclusion is Ramparts magazine.

This is a iberal, no,a

radical publication which represents the viewpoint of a small

minority. However, it has done some effective investigative

reporting, particularly in exposing the CIA infiltration into

college activities."

Ramparts assigned an investigator, William W. Turrier,

who they say is a former FBI agent, to spend 9 months

looking into the New Orleans evidence.

"I have worked closely with the D. A. (Garrison] and his

staff," Turner reports. "In my opinion, there is no question

that they have uncovered a conspiracy."

The gist of the New. Orleans. case is: that.Oswald was

Involved with a heterogeneous group of adventurers, anti-

Castro Cubans, and radical righters who included members

of the Minutemen and American Nazis.

Their common cause was to encourage or mount a revolt

in Cuba against Castro. They also were strongly

anmunist.

anti-

There is no question this group existed. Garrison has

crance that Oswald was part of it. Garrison's investigators

*. evidence that Oswald's pro-Russian leanings actually

cre a front, or a disguise to conceal his real role as an

-...

: ommunist.

GARRISON BELIEVES THAT Oswald was schooled in

covert operations by the CIA while in the marine corps.

at Atsugi naval station in Japan, Supporting evidence is !

Oswald's proficiency in the Russian language, the source of

which was never explained, the ease with which he entered

Russia, and the lack: of censure by the gövernment on his

return, or by the marine corps in his discharge.

In effect, Garrison feels Oswald was either a CIA, agent

or was involved with CIA activities.

The New Orleans group was angry at President Kennedy

because of the failure of the Bay of Pigs operation and

because thoy thought Kennedy wasn't sufficiently anti-

communist:

Garrison has dozens of witnesses he will subpena to fit

bits and pieces into the puzzle. Individually, many can be

dismissed as unreliable, but collectively they raise many

questions that an objective, observer would like to see

resolved.

It certainly is within the power of the federal govern-

ment to disprove every one of these witnesses' stories, if

they can be disproved. Presumably, the federal government

does not want to dignify Garrison's allegations with formal

denials.

IF THERE IS ANY substance to Garrison's charges;

two powerful agencies of the federal government stand to be

discredited. Garrison. has interviewed one witness, Richard

Cass Nagell, a highly decorated Korean war veteran who

claims to have been a CIA agent, who says be sent a

registered letter to: J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the

assassination plot: It this is true, Hoover and the FBI would

be guilty of dreadful dereliction of duty.

The CIA and CIA fronts are deeply involved in

the

activities of the men Garrison believes plotted the Presi-

dent's murder.

-Turner, the Ramparts investigator, believes powerful

government agencies are doing everything in their power

to discredit Garrison.

Ten persons involved in the case have iled, most of

them violently, since the assassination. All weat to their

graves with information Garrison considers pendent ic his

investigation..

Unless Garrison is killed or removed from office in

some way, it is difficult to see what can sto nim from

airing these stories, probably in a court of la... that the

public may judge their validity.

DATE: September 2, 1909

SUBJECT: Item in East Village Other, August 20, 1969

This past weekend, I visited a friend who had just returned from New

York City, bringing back a copy of a New York underground newspaper,

the East VIllage Other, dated August 20, 1969.

ut of crit p thou the paper an age to mone

so-called classified section, consisting generally of ads for male ano

female artists models and offerings of books alleged to instruct one

in the art of synthesizing hallucinogenics.

In the personal columns of this section, the following was noted, &

verbatim transcript of which is set forth:

"Caught In The Act. Notice to the CIA and all SY

shitheads who participated in Project Purple Shaft:

After that fiasco in the GIR you worms did your best

to screw, blue and tattoo me.

You even tried to have

my ass dusted in Berlin • e o you fuckups. Now Its

my turn to do a little shafting.

Cordially, R. C. NAGElte"

Card indices In SY/E reflect no indication that anyone named R. C.

NAGELI, or any variation thereof, including NAGLE or NOGULL, has

ever been granted clearance in this office.

A check in SY files reflected a record on Richard Case NAGEuL, born

August 5, 1930, who apprently is identical with the individual wo

authored the above Item. A cursory review of the file feflects that a

NAGELL has been of interest to both the FBI and the Dapartment

recent years.

While NAGEll may be something of a crackpot, the item

does appear to

contain somewhat of an Imolied threat.

For this reasong

• the informa

tion is forwarded for your consideration and for any action which may

be considered necessary.

LIMIT DISTKIBUTION

Background

My initial contact with Mr. Nagell was when he was

expelled

from the DDR by the East German officials who forcibly

propelled him toward us over the borderline into West Berlin.

As we initially escorted Mr. Nagell back to US Army lospital

Berlin in the Us Mission vehicle, he seemed unsure of where

he was,

and who we were, as well

as being angry and belligerent

about his treatment by the East Germans.

In the course of

the two hour interview which was then conducted at the

hospital, Mr. Nagell gradually regained his composure and

gave a more cooperative and coherent history.

At his

insistance, the interview took place in the presence of the

attorney Mr. Ricey S. New, Jre, who acted in an unofficial

capacity as a legally oriented "friend."

he tire the i e are a van an opini.

nan; and for the last six he was an officer, working in

military intelligence.

In 1954 he was the sole

survivor in

a plane crash which resulted in a brain concussion, numerous

physical injuries, and prolonged military hospitalization.

Mr. wagell now claims that he believes it was this head

injury which resulted in his "unstable personality and

immature or impulsive

behaviour."

le attributes to this

instability his marital difficulties and his decision to

resign his comnission in 1959, something which he now considers

unwise.

At the time of his leaving the service he was not

awarded a disability pension, but he says that he was later

no are or his leavince

able to successfully petition the VA for a "4i4" disability."

He claims that he had never seen a psychiatrist during his

military careei'.

From liby to 1962 le says that he worked for the stac of

California as an investigator for various burcaus.

marital difficulties had increased and his wife insisted on

separation, keeping with her their to children.

dagell

says that one night in 1962 he became intoxicated, and tricd

to break down the door to her apartment.

On this basis he

says he lost his job and says that for

the next year he

"just drifted," apparently without motivation to worl,

supporting himself on his disability pension and financial

aid from his sister.

lle is not certain about whether or not

the divorce from

his wife has ever been legally compieted.

LINIT DISTRIBUTION

In September 1963 he was accused of committing an act which

he now says was bred out of his feeling of hopelessness

and desperation. lle claims that in a confused way he

attempted while armed to rob a bank and was easily appre-

hended.

For the next 4 1/2 years followed a complicated

series of trials, appeals and retrials.

In addition to

spending these years in prison, he also had at least three

prison hospitalizations for psychiatric observation. His

appeals apparently hinged on his contention that he was

"temporarily insane" at the time of the crime.

He was not

considered insane at any time during his imprisonment, and

his claim to temporary insanity found support in the expert

testimony of a noted American neurologist, Dr. Edwin

Weinstein.

Dr. Weinstein apparently interpreted lagell's

BEG's (electro-encephalograms) as being abnormal and argued

that Nagell had developed a "paranoid personality, and

instability" on the basis of his brain injury.

This conten

tion was apparently disputed by other expert witnesses, but

in any case Nagell was officially acquitted on April 29 of

this year.

Nagell says he then

went to the New York area, where his

sister (his closest relative) resides, but he claims an

additional complication in his life had risen in that he

had once been an "acquaintance" of Lee liarvey Uswald, and

had been implicated in a possible plot to assassinate

President Kennedy in an article in RAMPART'S magazine which

appeared in January 1968.

11x. Nagell firmly denies that he

was involved in any way with any such conspiracy, and was

in fact imprisoned at the time of the assassinatione On

the basis of this magazine article Nagell says that

Mr. Garrison, the attorney general from New Orleans who is

arguing that a conspiracy existed in the assassination,

came up to New York to interview him. Nagell says that he

denied that he had any information of use to Mr. Garrison,

but that the interview left him with two fears.

One fear

was that Garrison might subpoena him to testify in the New

Orleans proceedings, and the other fear was that the CIn

might try to "eliminate" him, a suspicion which he says

was planted in his mind by Mr. Garrison. He says that soon

afterwards while walking down a street at night in New York.

City he was almost run over by a car without lights. le

interpreted this as being an attempt at murder by the CIA

and in some haste left the country for a tour of Europe.

In June, shortly thereafter, he discussed with an American

consular official in Zurich

his recurrent fear that the

CIA was going to "hit" him. His next travel point was to

West Berlin, and on June 1l, 1968, while his train was

traversing

the. DDR, he says that he was taken off the

train and illegally detained.

He is not certain why he

was taken off the train but

admits to having talked freely

on the train to other

passengers about his life history,

and he was also carrying with him a heavy portfolio of

all

of his Army and government records involved with his service

career, disability, and imprisonment.

For several mcntlis

Nagell claims that he was interrogated by the Last Germans

and repeatedly asked to confess his role as a spy or govern

ment agent. Eventually, Nagell says that he concluded the

only way to be released would be to feign mental illress,

This was several weeks

ago and he says he was soon examined by an Last German

psychiatrist and events were set in motion which culminated

in his release today, four and one-half months after his

detention began.

Mr. Nagell's plans for the future center around returning

to

the United States and beginning an appeal to the sovern-

ment to grant him a psychiatric disability pension, as well

injury. He no longer believes that it is realistic to think

that the CIA was trying to kill him.

Mental Status Exam

Mr. Nagell is a tall, 38 year old male who shows the evidence

of a prior head injury in the form of extensive

scars on

the deft side of his tace, facial asymmetry due to seventh:

nerve injury reconstructive surgery on his left ear, etc.

In addition he shows

some healed incisions on his left wrist

which he claims were superficial lacerations self-inflicted

few weeks ago in the DDR.

he

seriously intended to kill himself.

He is of superior

intelligence

and shows a

remarkable memory for dates and

names.

Summary

In summary then we seem to be dealing with a person who has

had a personality disorder for a number of years, manifested

by emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, a tencency

to be litigious, and a general suspicious or paranoic

orientation. It is difficult to know how much of what he

again.

His own closing words provide a lighter note to what other-

wise has been a

complicated and

serious mishap.

SLOSS, a atall employee since 1948, has recently been

repolygraphed with inconclusive results, having reacted to questione

regarding disclosure of chessifled information, association with & com-

muniet sympathizer, and homosexuallty. He has alao been lavolved

with cooperation in an entamarital aflair which chiminated la & black-

mall attempt on one of the parties. His name lo perhaps identical with

& name among six names of Agency employees lound on a mentally die

turbed and disaffected former CIC Intelligence officetwho alleges contact

arons In tegard to 52058 are set forth bolow.. Recommend Intenalve and

thorough lavestigation of SLOSS including survelliance al acklvities.

Ela parento are Amertean bork... He graduated from Tale Univeralty la

3. The name of John SLOSS may be Identical with the name i.

SLOSS found on the pereon of Richard Que NAGELL when arrested to con-

nection with a bank robbezy in ILl Paso, Texas, on 20 Septembez 1963. A

notebook found on NAGELL erade reference to Fair Play for Cuba Commit-

teo, the addresses of Foreign Embasales, the namen of purported CLA

agente and other information. Although NAGSLI le inquestionably menti

ally unbalanced, he telle a story of being involved in esplenese which le

not fully contradicted by evidence. There in no apparent explanation of

why the name J, SLOSS as well an five other naee of CIA personnel

should have been in the possession of Richard Case NAGEll. The weird

story of NAGELL 1 contained in a chronological listing of his activitlee

appended to thie memorander.

A review of the Security file on SLOSS in connection with the

Richard Case NAGELL matter revealed that SLOSS, for the part few yeare,

1960-1964, had provided hig apartment as a place of eesignation in the

adulterous relatlonship ofl

S. It is noteworthy in the SLOSS

matter

that SLOSS has been involved In cooperating in an unlawful and Immoral

activity which, according to the direct testlmony of one of the parties,

(belteved to be true because the report was agalast her own Interest)

resulted in a bleckmall attempt againat her in May 1964,

6. Of particular concern should be the resulte of the lateet

two polygraph examinations, the validity of which, because of medication

including a tranquiliner type drug and alcohol in the Subjecte system, was

deemed to be inconclusive.

7. During the 1955 polygraph examination, the Subject admitted

to homoserual desires but stated that there had never caused a persona)

problem and had never resulted in bio partieipation in a homosemal act,

During the 24 April 1964 examination, the Subject showed consietent re-

actions to the homosexual question which indicated deception. During

SECRET

## Page 91

further specifte questioning on 22 May 1964 covering the various homoseal

areas however, there were no strong reactions to indicate that Subject might

be practicing deception on the spectile queation regarding engaging ta home-

nexual activities since working for CIA.

In connection with the phane of questione concerning contact

with any possible communiet eympathiser, the Subject reflected overall

disturbance indicating that all the questions obvlounly bothered him and

that deception was being practiced within that phase. The polygraph opera-

tor noted that there were outatanding reactione to the following two questione:

20 b "Other than your comments about FISHER, during your

undergraduite period at Tale did you have any contact

With any Communlat or Communat sympathizer?

Answer: No. "

20 €

During your CIA employment, have you had any contact

with any Communist or Communiet aympathizer?

Aneter: No. *

9, It la particularly noteworthy that during bin examination on

Z2 May 1964 when asked nine questione an to whether he had been acquaint.

ed with certain individuale, Sabject only reacted when he answered "no"

to beving been acquainted with Jerry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTQN. These

names had been submitted to Subject based upon pure conjecture that there

possibly might have been come connection with these Individuals at Camp

Ritchle Military Intelligence Training Genter. Since the faet that both

Jerry SEVERN and llya WOLSTAN have cooperated with Sovlet Intelligence

bould have been unknown to SLOSS and he declared he is not acquainted

with theo, there should have been no reason for him to react to these names.

The polygraph operator mates that SLOSS was not pressed further regarding

FISHER (whom he had claracterized as "left of center") or hia own posalble

knowledge of SEVERN or WOLSTON since it was obvious that SLOSS was

beginning to feel haraaned on this matter and stated that he did not enjoy

being anked these questione.

10, During SLOSS' interview on 1 April 1964, SLOSS reflected

consistent reactinne on the questione:

"Since working for CIA, have you glven CIA documente or

classllied information to unauthorized persons?*

- 3=

SECRET

"Have you ever deliberately given classified information on

documents to any unauthorised person?"

In explanation, Subject nald he whe bothered by thin idea, but

that he had no knomledge of any particular aleuation wherein he had di-

valged information to anyone who was unauthorised to receive it or whe

woald have ueed it against the Agency's interest. On the test adminietered

on 22 May 196€ to resolve any possible compromise to communiet or forelga

intelligence organinations, It wan determined that there were no significant

reactions to relevant questione in thie area.

I It should be especially noted that the polygraph operator during

the & April 1964 interview, detected an odd mell on Subject's breath and

noted his fluched face, frequent silly grins and lethargle movernents, aug-

sesting that the Subject may have been elightly intondcated. The operator

did not ank during this intervlew whether the Subject had taken any drug

or alcohol pries to the interview but recalled an incident wherein the Sub-

Ject when arrested for drunken delving in 1963 bad produced evidence that

he was a diabetic and had taken medication prior to the ineident. Conne

quently, during the second interview on 22 Iday 1964, Subject was questioned

regarding his physical health. He replied that he had stopped taking modi-

cation for diabetes in November 1963. He explathul that he took three of

four diuretic pille. He specifically denied that he had taken any other drug;

narcotic or alcohol. When this question was asked during interrogation.

he refected reaction indicative of decoption and then admitted that for

brealdaat he had taken one glass of vodka with some orange juice. He

stated that he drank vodka for breakinet sometimes whenever he was tense

or nervous over anything.

12. The polygraph operator in hie report concluded that the

Hyalidity of final tent charts la held in quention and there is no

strong evidence that the specific areas of concern have been

conclusively resolved at this time. It le recommended that a

further atudy be conducted on this case and that information

resulting from such a study be sent to IRD for possible reinter-

view of the Subject and polygraph resolution".

13. SLOSS bas indicated reactions indicative of deception during

the polygraph examinatione. In one specific question where these te-

actions were present, he admitted to lying. This was in the question as

to whether or not he had taken any alcohol prior to the examination.

CONCLUSION:

SLOSS has lied Inhis most recent polygraph examination and

has evidenced Indications of deception in areas concerning divolgiag

Classifled Information to unauthorised individuals, association with a

coroman et sympathizer and homosexual inelinations. SLOSS! reaction

to the names ot Jerry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTQN has not been fully ex-

plored. The polygraph operator has recommended further investigation

and i repolygraph because the recent tests are laconclusive.

2. SLOSS har been Involved in an immoral and 1llegal extra-

marital actlvity between a Stall employee and a former Staff employee

where one of the parties was subjected to a blackmall attempt.

The name 1, SLOSS (possibly identical to Subject) appeared

on a lal of CIA employees found en the person of a self-designated "die-

allected Americnn" arrested by the FBI for bank robbery la September

This Individual (mentally disturbed) with previous intelligence es-

perience has declared that he was appronched by Sovlet Intelligence while

and/or aftes he was ln Mexico City In Septembes 1962.

It in cusgosted that the extent of the adverse security implica-

tione concerning SLOSS le nich, that 11 SLOSS is ever found to be a security

rink, the failure at thia time to pureue an aggreadive investigation of all

his contacte and activities to resolve alt arene of doubt could possibly lend

to a conclusion that we have been remies in our duties. The underaigned

recompends the following action:

That phyalcal and technical surveillance of at least two

weeks duration be made of SLOSS to determine his contacte and

activities after working houre:

b. That current seven way National Agency Checks be made

on SLOSS.

C That Richard B. FISHER, & Irlend of SLOSS%, characterized

by him as having been involved in radical and left of center ideas

while en undergraduate at Yale, be fully Identified, his present lo-

cation be ancertained and the degree of hie association with ALOSS

be determined by a personal loterview with FISHER.

d. That Richard Case NACELL be personally Iateivlewed by

reveal how be came into the pessession of the name J. SLOSS and

Queens, Long Island, New York, telephone number HA 6-6830,

and was attempting to obtsin employment in the New York area,

NACELL advised his present objective was

to have the California

ARC exposed, and he was willing to furnish court room

testimony" that would result in the prosecution of many

Los Angeles hoodlums and their

attorneys, who have acted

as go-betweens in securing alcoholic beverage licenses

through payoffs:

MAGELL advised that he was shot in July, 1962, as

a result of his refusal to "lay off" the Nauna-Loa Invertiga-

tion; however, he declined to disclose the details concerning

the actual shooting

NAGELL stated he had furnished some information to

the State of California investigators assigned to the

California Attornoy General's Office; however, nothing was

accomplished through this

NAGELl appeared overwrought and obsessed with a

desire to expose the ABC, and, as a result, clear bis name.

He stated this situation has caused a Separation

between

himself and his wife and children, who are still residing in

Los Angeles.

NAGELL advised he had spoken with SA "DICK" RICHARDS

he had given limited information to him, due to personal

circumstances at the time. He requested that apologies be

conveyed to SA RICHARDS for not "going all the way" on

"As of the aforementioned date, and prior thereto;

responsible authoritles of the Department of Alcoholic

Beverage Control were aware of the forgoing information.

The two agents who handled special ownership investigations

in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area (consisting of 3500

licensees) were OWEN J. MC CARD, a hanger-on and close friend

Of MILLIAM G. BONELLI, former Director of SBE, and myself

During the course of my investigations I received pressure

from both MC CARD and certain superiors to fluff off on

certain invostigations, and to press others - depending on the

licensee or who the hoodlums were in back of the business

concerned. This I did not do. In my opinion this resulted

directly in my dismissal from the department, regardless of

what other ostensible reasons were

tendered

It is a fact

that l was shot as a result of one of my investigations even

though it could have been avoided by myself. Certain

reports of investigations which

I turned in were not forwarded

thru proper charnels, some of them were destroyed; I was

pulled off of some investigations before their completion

(which were not roassigned; certain licensees were notified

that I was investigating them; and I was aware of bribes boing

that his main trouble is headaches which I have had continuously

recently. He also complains of dizziness, and at times an

unsteady gait.

These symptoms are sometimes associated with

a transient loss of menory.. During the interview his retention

and recall were good. Sensorium was intact. When I asked

him what he thought was wrong he said "I think my trouble is

physiologic.

When

tasked him what he ncant by phystologic

he Stated My trouble is all due to my head injury

He felt

reassured when I told him that i thought some of his symptoms

were due to that mishap.

Although he snoked continuously

during the interview he related quite a story about his Army

activitles and his domestic situation, but was sorewhat evasive

about the trouble he was in while in California,

especially

the trouble involving the f.B.t, and some shooting event.

He

was presented before the

Psychiatric stand and at first was

sonewhat reluctant to answer questions and when asked a question

that was not due to his liking he would relate

this is my

private lite."

During the Staff Conference he said 'you

Psychiatrists are all stereotyped.

During

the Staff

Conference, however, his mond was one of friendliness and

not one of depression, although he will occasionally get irri-

table when supposedly asked, a personal question.

After the

interview at the Staff Meeting he approached

me saying that

aides to know about his

business and

that was the

reason why he refused to give out

any information."

He further related that he keeps everything

in a little book that he has done or said because he has a poor

memory, although some of these memory deficils were not brought

out in the interview with him.

He was advised to stay on the

ward for another week or two for further observation but

¿eit chat he didnot have to since nothing more could be done

for him. He also said the reason for him wishlog to leave

was that

the had a job in mind and was going for an interview.

and although no psychotic behavior was noted, it was felt

El Paso, Texas :

NAGELL told STANGA that after his release

from the United States Army, he drifted from job to job and

became nore and more mentally confused as to his political,

relagiouse

and economic allegiances. During this confused

period, rAGELl apparently became a member of the Communist

Party of the United States

and told STANGA that he did some

minor work for this organization prior to his trip to El Paso

NACElL also explained to STANGA that he divorced his wife during

this period, and after making several scenes with his wife,

was barred by court order from seeing his children. During

this period of his llfe, NAGELL told STANGA that he lived in

the los Angeles, California, area.

NAGELL explained to STANGA that he came to El Paso,

after making a decision that everything was against

him in Los Angeles and that he should attempt to leave

the

United Stetes for a Conmunist country in Europe. In line with

this decision to leave the United States, NAGEll made a contact

with

the Communist Party in Los Angeles, and arranged to meet

a courier or contact mna for the Party in El Paso, Texas:

This

contact man was allegedly to have a visa

and passport for

NAGELL SO that he might leave the United States and eventually

end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELl then left the Los Angeles

area and drove to El Paso, Texas.

He told STANGA that during

this trip, he stopped by the side of the road on at least

three occasions and attempted suicide with a pistol which

was in his possession.

He explained to STANGA, however

that he did not have the guts to do it and just let things

drift along. After arriving in El Paso,:

Texas, NAGEl, said

that he got a hotel room

and again attempted suicide with

the revolver. He agata did not have the nerve to "pull the

trigger" and decided. that the best way to commit suicide

would be by leaving the hotel and having a "shoot-out" with

43

a policeman.

Me lere the hotel room, got in his car.

and

proceded down the streets of M Paso looking for a policeman

ho looked like he would shoot it out with him.

NAGELL told

STANGA that he did not see a patrolman, however, and decided

that be would enter the State National Bank of El Paso and

cause a big ruckus because he knew that a policeman was in

the building guarding a Treasury Department moncy display.

NiGill entered the bank and fired to shots into n wall and

then left the bank fully expecting to be shot down by

pussing policeman: Mowever, he escaped to his cat, which was

parindian an alley, and gave up peaceably then arrested by

the policeman who was guarding the money display in the bank

VAGULI told STANCA that his robbery of the bank was purely a

suicide uttompt and that he had no intention of robbing the

bank for any monetary gain

In addition to the Communist activities mentioned

above, STANTA reported that NiGElL told him of

a number of

roild of microfilm which contained names, meeting places

and othor activities of the Communist Party, which

were in his

possession.

NAGEll explained that these microfilms were hidden

in a or mask (laponese type) which was located

at his sister's

house in New York Caty.

He went on to say that these micro-

film arn bidion in the salve container which is afixed to the

gus maska

MAGELL 2150

explained to STANGA tbad he had not

riven this information to the Federal

Boreau of Investigation

because he foit they would indict him as a spy and put him'in

jail for life:

On January 6, 1964, the subject furnished the

following signed statement:

"1/6/64

'ET PASO, TeXaS

"T. Richard Case Nagell, do hercby make the following

tree and voluntary statement to Edward fosoph Murphy and

Inorence y. Gorman, who have identifird themsolves to me as

Sprcial Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

They

have advised me that i do not have to make any sissement and

that any statement that I do make may be used against me in

a court of law.

They have advised me that l may have an

attorney If. I desire. No threats, promises, force, or

/inducements of any kind have been used to get me to furnish

this statement

"I was born on August 5, 1930 at Greenwich, New York

"The following statement is relative to the motive

which actuated my conduct on September 20, 1963•

"In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City a

representative of a foreign government proposed to me that I

participate in an act; Such act being

a criminal offense and

inimical to the best interests of the United States

At that

time I refused such proposal. In May, 1963, another representa-

tive of the same foreign

government made the same proposal

to me.

At that time I agreed to such a proposal:

"In Sept. 1963, I was informed by an American, known

to me as an ogent of the

same foreign government,

• that arrange

ments for my participation in the aforementioned act were

completed. At this time I refused the aforesaid proposal.

"Approximately one weck later I was instructed by

this same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be disclosed

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Thereupon I agreed

to follow the instructions of this person, although I did

nothintend to do so.

This existing situation actuated my

conduct of september 20, 1963, for which I was arrested and

am/presently charged.

"I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I

thought that my arrest would provide an immediate, though

temporary solution to the problem with which I was confronted

I am not guilty as charged.

for a period of 30 days for the purpose of psychiatric

not cooperate with the psychiatrists at the Medical Center

for Federal Prisoners at Springtield,

While being removed from the United States District

Court House in El Paso, Toxas, enroute to the El Paso County

Jail on January 24, 1964, and while'in the custody of the

Deputy Unitod States Marshals, the

subject accused the

Assistant United States Attorney of violating his constitutional:

wights. This accusation was a repetition of numerous accusations

shich the subject had previously made against the Assistant

United States Attorney, according to Assistant I. S. Attorney MORTON.

OR January 34, 1964, Assistant United States Attorney

FREDERICK J. MORTON, El Paso, advised that he had received

formation on a confidential basis a short while before to

the etfect that there was a man incarcerated in the El Paso

County Jail under a Federal charge of attempted bank robbery

by the name of RICHARD CASE NAGElL wo as a

Communist and

sho was about to defoct to Russia when arrested. Mr. MORTON

related that the story was

generally that NAGELL, a retired

Amy Coptain who served with distinction in the Korcan Yar in

combat andiwith CIC, became embittered with the United States

and our form of government partially due to the alleged denial

nf visitation privileres of his children, custody over whom

awarded to his Japanese wife: by California divorce decree

He allegedly turned over secret material to Soviet agents

while in the Militory Service

He was supposed to obtain/

n passport to Russia here in El Paso from a Communist agent

but was so distraught over the possibility of never again

seeing his children that he considered suicide or some other

drastic means of preventing his defecting that he went in

a bank in El Poso, asked for $100.00 in cashier's cheques,

pulled a gun which caused the teller to run, and fired two

shots high into the wall and fled. At the time of his

arrest, he called the policeman

"capitalistic sob

and has stated that what he did was done out of "love for

country.

$%.

Other than that be has made no statements

concerning the bank robbery except to say that he did not.

intend to take any money.

He has refused

to talk to a

psychiatrist and fired two court appointed attorneys. His

court room appearances have convinced all that he is

intelligent and competent mentally but extremely confused

and disturbed.

He files

motions and writs almost daily,

which are

well written and lawyer like.

At the time of his arrest, September 20, 1963; a

notebook was taken from him containing what purport to be

various codes,

CIA

and FRl agents' names, Soviet and other

Communist embassy addresses

and names, and the addresses

of various other people and organizations, including the

Los Angeles address of the "Fair Play for Cuba Conmittee:"

NAGELL has supposedly recently received a 1963 Information Please

almanac with a scrambled message. Mention is made of this

in the notebook

NAGELL is supposed to have located at the address

of his sister,

Mrs. ELEANORE GAMBERT, 82-25 Grand Avenue,

Elmburst 73, Long Island, New York, HA 6-6830, a trunk in

which a Japanese gas mask is contained. In the salve box of

this mask are supposedly 4 rolis of microfilm containing

the names of various Communist Party members, agents, couriers,

thotr activittes, etc.

A man by

the name of FRED JOHN (BeNJO),

an insurance agent in California,' is supposed to get these

things fron NAGEIL's sister in the event of NACELL's death.

The

sister

supposedly knows nothing of the contents and is

not a Communist.

NAG ELL

recently wrote a letter

to this

Mr -

JOHN in Californta mentioning the almanac bit.

Mr.

MORTON said he rejected an offer of a deal for information

purportedly furnished by NAGELL to the FBT

regarding Communists

in exchange for favorable consideration made through NAGELL'S

prior court appointed attorney on the basis that the information

was of no

value.

Mr: MORTON's confidential source told him

that NAGELl's prior

contacts with the FBI were not revealing

because they were made by him solely to determine what the

FBI knew of him.

Play for Cuba Committee," or Cuba. Once in the summer of

1963 NAGELI was mad about something unrecalled and Jokingly

said he was thinking of going to Russia, but Mrs. NACELL 18

certain this was said In jest.

Mrs, NAGELI 1s of the opinion there 1s something

mentally wrong with NAGELL.

He would fly Into violent rages

without apparent reason.

She pointed out that her television

set has a split plastic case and stated NAGELl hit the set

with his fist once while angry and this resulted In this

damage.

Although NAGELL did not like his children, during

the marriage, he has frequently complained about not being

with them since the divorce. but has never since the divorce

He sends them cards fron various

places In the United States,

furnished support for the children or Mrs. NAGELL.

As a con-

sequence, Mrs. NAGELL has been supporting herself

and the

children

through employment as a waitress and has to board

the children out.

On March 6, 1964, Mrs. NAGELI stated to SA HOOSE

that she never knew NAGELI, to be involved In espionage in any

manner•

She further commented that they were always In fInan

clal difficulty during their residence in the United States.

During the marriage NAGELI, had a bank account at the Bank of

America, Wilshire and Vermont, Los Angeles, but Mrs. NAGELL

doubts there was ever much money in the account.

She said

that since the separation in April of 1962, NAGELI. has sent

her a total of about $180.00.

There 1s no Information In the files of the Los

Angeles Office of the FBI identiflable with Mrs. MITSUKO NAGELL.

she moved to Los Angeles In May of 1955. It was then seven

years before she heard directly from him or saw him.

Into RICHARD by chance on the street In Los Angeles, saw that

he needed help, and thereafter tried to give him both moral and

fInanclal assistance.

Mrs: NAGELI, gave her son $1,000.00 on one occasion

and much smaller amounts on other occasions. He never expressed

appreciation for this help.

RICHARD never seemed to have enough

money. she does not know 11 he had a bank account or not.

Mrs: NAGELI was trying to locate RICHARD after he

had disappeared for several days. She knew he could often

be found at The Happy Rabbit, a beer: Joint at 2709 West SIxth

Street, Los Angeles.

She went there and found RICHArD, and

he flew into an uncontrollable rage because she had gone Inside

this bar, clalming 1t was no place for a decent woman.

Mrs, NACElL stated it was really not that bad a place.

Mrs. NAGELI was In a way happy to have the

boys get together after years of estrangement.

She

described LOUIS as being an almost hopeless alcoholic.

She thought since both sons had serlous problems, they might

be able to help each other. LOUIS has told her,

however,

that he was never able to straighten out RICHARD.

She stated that RICHARD never discussed communism

never mentioned Cuba or the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee"

or gave any indication he was in any manner involved in

espionage.

On March 9, 1964, Mrs. NAGELL Informed SA HOOSE

that she wanted to point out that RICHARD had never physically

In addition, the subject had in his possession at

the time of his arrest on September 20, 1963, a piece of

paper containing the listing of what appeared to be United

States Army Officers and their serial numbers. One section.

of this paper was listed under the heading "Third Operations

Group".

On March 24, 1964, Lieutenant Colonel NAD W. GLENN

Deputy G-2, United States Army, Japan, advised that he had

known the subject personally and had served in lorea with

the subject.

GLEN! noted that his name appeared in one of

the above mentioned photographs of papers which were found

In the possession of the subject when arrested in El Paso

on September 20, 1963. GLENV stated that he and the subject

had been attached to an Intelligence Branch of the United

States Army in the Far East during the period of their acquaintance.

GLENN explained that the names in parentheses in

one of the above mentioned photographs were "code names" used

---

## Page 192

13-00000

EP 65-951

by members of Army Intelligence Units In Korea in order to

protect their real identities fron informants.

GLENN also advised that the subject was not

stable mentally and that this instability was probably due

to damage to brain tissues suffered in an airplane crash

during the Korcan War in which the subject was the only

survivor. GLENN stated that the subject, in fact, did have

a brilliant war record, which was the

reason for his

assignment to Army Intelligence in spite of what should

have

been an obvious. psychological defect.

GLENN pointed out as an example of the subject's

instability that the subject had turned in allegations

against an Intelligence Officer in Korea, which became the

subject of extensive investigation.

GLENN added that te

subject was subsequently transferred to another Army unit

and upon reporting to that unit, was greeted in a friendly

way by his nes Connandiag Officer, who told him he hoped

the subject would enjoy his new assignment and that he,

the Commander, would do all he could to make it a worthwhile

tour of duty for the subject.

To this, NACELL allegedly replied that the Commander

had certainly better see that this was the case as, NAGELI

told him, he made a practice of keeping a record of every.

move made by his Cormanding Officer and if he stepped out

of line one: whit at any time, it would be made the subject

of an immediate report to higher headquarters.

GLENN made available: a letter from the Assistant

Chief of Staff, G2/G-3, United States Army, Japan, which

was in answer to a request for information regarding the

subject and which contained the following infomstion:

SUBJECT, after graduation from the Army Intelligence

School, Fort Holabizd, Maryland, In August 1955, served as an

advisor to the Flrst Republic of Korea Army and subsequently

in Sendal, and Tolyo, Japan, terminating in about 1958.

these assigments were concerned with intelligence activities,

5 a

## Page 193

13-00000

EP 65-951

as an advisor to the ROK AIry in Korea, and as a member of the

US Army Counterintelligence Corps in Japan.

During the

latter tour of duty, the counterintelligence unit was designated

the 35d Operations

Group, with Headquarters in Tokyo and

Detachment B in Sendai,

as referred to in photographic inclosures

to your letter.

In assignments of this natire it is common practice

for members to become acquainted with personnel of various.

Iapanese security agencies, such as are mentioned in March

5 Menorandum of the FBI, El Paso, Tezas. It is not unusual

for individuals assigned counterintelligence duties to retain

lists of these persons for reference in the event they are

again reassigned to the area, or for dispatching cards or

thank you notes fron the United States.

This would appear

to be the reason for SUBJECT having kept the list of agency

personnel, although to have retained

the list for a number of

years arter leaving the service appears unusual. The names Kaji,

Wataru and Jack Cannon were known to the public as the results

of allegations of illegal intelligence operations that were

publicized in the Japanese press, but SUBJECT'S reason for

Including those names in HIS lists cannot be assessed. Also,

no reason can be given for the two or thice miscellaneous

names in NAGELL'S file.

The list of Americans mentioned in one of the photographic

attachments pertains to US personnel in the intelligence field.

It appears that the subject maintained a roster of those persons...:

with whom he would or had contact, which is aot unusual.

Information contained on those rosters, particularly that

portion indicating code nanes, was and is regarded as classified

information by this office.

Files of the Counterintelligence Repository, USARJ,

disclosed no information relañive to NAGilL or of his aliases.

and sentenced the subject to

serve ten years under the

provisions of Section 4208 (a) (II), Title 18, United States

Code, which provides that the subject can be released under

parole at any time it is deemed advisable. This sentence

was for violation of Section 2113, Title 18, United States

Code:

The June 17, 1964 issue of "The El Paso Herald

Post", contained an article entitled "Inmate

several sleeping pills while lodged at the El Paso County Jail

on June 17, 1964- According to the article, NAGELl was to

be kept under observation all night and was to be transferred

to the William Beaumont Cenezal Eospital fron the La Tuna

The article further stated that Deputy U.S. Marshal

Richard Sloss in identical to "J. Slone," it la not possible from

It

does not appear that the above information could affect either the

prosecution of or the defense of Nagell on the charge of bank rob

cover problems for this Agency, ae well an directing additional at-

tention to the position of Fecteau.

Dear Floyd:

18 April 1964

JIFLOYD PARKER

#1050

CREIGHTON CHURCHILL #7657

It was good to hear from you, to learn

you are still at the old shop; etc.

I got your letter yesterday in New York,

and while driving the 300-odd miles hoped that my

subconscious would perhaps come out with a peal of

a bell regarding an individual named Ed Nagell. But

no bellsrang.

I have only a small hunch -- a piccolo-toot

in my memory. When I worked for the shop I once went

to see Mr. James Bennett, Director of Federal Prisons,

with whom I had once shared a table on an ocean

liner, years before. You can guess why I wanted to

see Bennett: I was seeking ways for birds to fly out

of cages.

Bennett mentioned a guy (with a questionable

record, as far as he was concerned) who claimed to

know us, you and me, what we were doing., etc. etc.

He had aproached Bennett " as from us".

Ed Nagell

- the name -- rings a piccolo-toot on this, but only

that.

Incidentally, I filed a report on the incident

when I got back to the shop.

I am often in New York -- at the Harvard

Club -- and should you ever be in town, give me a ring.

It would be fun to see you.

I met Harry Osterweis in

a restaurant the other day - fater some many, many

years. You may remember him.

I have recently become an author on Wines.

After a year in France in 1959, I wrote a book on French

wines which was published by Knopf, and

am about to bring

out one on wines of the world with MacMillan in September.

That is about the extent of my news.

My best to you.

Asked FBI in Miami if his Cuban or Russian sourcés

gave him a pistol with silencer and microfilm if he

would be permitted to return same to his contact so

he could be of further use to U.S. Government.

stated that in August or September 1962 he met a man

from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to

individuals whom he believed may have been Soviet Agent.

Advised FBI in Los Angeles, California, that he had

taken his former wife to court for failure to comply with

court order giving NAGELL visitation rights with children.

NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was re-

ferred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His

condition was diagnosed as'depression, tearful, nervous,

rigid".. Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".

NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of at-

tempting to rob State National Bank.

Slashed wrist night

of 9/20/63. NAGELL consistently denied he had tried

to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots

in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone.

He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have

been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to

Cuba!!

A notebook which the Subject had on his person when ar-

rested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee,

the names of purported CIA agents and other information.

Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him

that NAGELL, during confused period after dischaige,

decided everything against him in Los Angeles and made

arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to

pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and

eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL reportedly

attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but

lost nerve.

(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance

of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles,

California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affi-

davit that his passport had been lost or stolen. He was

issued a new passport on 6 August 1963.)

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told

U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up

the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELL

told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank.

I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time."

Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed

acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD

on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledgé of NAGELL.

NAGELL furnished a signed statement:

"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a

representative of a foreign government preposed to me

that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal

offense and inimical to the best interest of the United

States.

At that time, I refused such proposal. In May

1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-

ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I

agreed to such a proposal."

"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,

known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government,

that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned

act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid

proposal.

Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this

same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be

disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-

upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,

although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation

actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I

was arrested and am presently charged.

I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. " I thought that

my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary,

solution to the problem with which I was confronted.

I am not guilty as charged. "

NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for

bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the

purpose of psychiatric examination.

Sentenced in U.S. District Court, El Paso, Texas to

serve i0 years.

NAGELL swallowed several sleeping pills while lodged

at the El Paso County Jail.

Under Secretary of the Army

Room IE520, The Pentagon

Washington, D.C•

Dear

Mr. Plant:

In further reference to my letter from Switzerland: During our conver-

sation of 6 April you made it clear that I must step back into time and grove

the existence of a condition

over ten years ago that could and should have

been resolved by the Army then . :.

•afeat that is all the nore complicated

by the ABCMR's refusal to interview the appropriate withesses, viow certain

pertinent records and to place the blame for my not receiving an adequate

medical examination where it belongs.

I believe what you really meant to say was that in my particular case

(as opposed to others much less valid) the function of the Board to correct

an injustice does not apply.

So if this

assumption is fact,

as I have every reason to feel it is, ther

you ray pass on to the Secretary that before my case is closed the Army will be

confronted with a scandal that will make France's Dreyfus affair seem inconse-

quential by comparison.

I am not quite the fool that apparently I have been

taken for.

Very truly,

P.S.

SLOSS found on the person of Richard Cast NAGELL when arrested in con

nection with a bank robbery in El Paso, Texan, on 20 Saptember 1963. A

notebook found on NAGELL rade relarence to Fair Play for Cuba Commli

tee, the addresses of foreign Embarnies, the names of purported CIA

agents and other laformation. Although NAGELL is unquestionably mant-

ally unbalanced, he telle a story of being involved la espionage waich is

not fully contradicted by ovidence.. There is no apparent explanation of

why the name I. SLOSS as well an five other names of CIA personnel

should have been in the possestion of Richard Case NAGEL!.. The weird

story of NAGEL, i contained in a chronological listing of bis activitien

appended to this memorandum.
