Ms. Penelope Grenoble, Editor

Dear Ms. Grenoble:

This letter is in response to the distortions and outright falsities
printed about’ me in the article written by William Ww. Turner, titled

‘BANK ROBBER, 'HANCHURIAN CANDIDATE’: LINKED TO JFK ASSASSINATION PROBE,|

which appeared in the July 25-31 edition of tne Los Angeles Free Press

I request that the Free Press either print a retraction of such. lies |
and distortions or publish this letter.

Mr. Turner, who spent ten years as a Special Agent of the FBI, is not!
unfamiliar to me. He has authored similar articles, both during my (°:
imprisonment in the United States and while I was detained in the
German Democratic Republic,-in which he knowingly and purposefully
eited numerous lies about me. He has proved himself adevt at putting
words in my mouth and misquoting his sources of information to lend
credence to his major untruths, a skill he probably developed while ©
serving with the Bureau's intelligence-security division. ~ His recent
claims cause me to wonder whether or not he ever left the FBI.

Professor Richard H. Popkin, ‘from whom Mr. Turner obviously collected
much of his latest baloney, is a character that I. feel should either.’

ealled discussions with him (all but one occurred over the t

The “papers" that I “carried” when arrestéd did\no
“decorated hero of the Korean War," nor did the:
about "a career in Army intelligence.” More to tne point, the docu-

returned‘to me only last year by the FBI) ensured my incarceration {
for a longer period than I had anticipated. .They also guaranteed my
being held practically incommunicado for many months (for eleven '
months I was not even pérmitted to read a newspaver), not to mention
the curtailment of my most basic constitutional safeguards. i

as. Mr. Turner, the FBI and the CIA damn wel3, know.

I have never atited to anybody, either verbally or in writing, that
in 1963 I was an agent for the CIA, although in.1974 I did state,
under oath, that I thought I had been functioning for the CIA during

spart of 1963. Mr. Turner is also aware that less than two months

after President.Kennedy’s death FBI agents confronted me with their
suspicion that I had “acted as.an unregistered agent for a foreign
power," inferring that I was a spy for one of the Cuban intelligence
services (several years later the CIA, through one of its “former"
ease officers, accused me of having been a Soviet spy: still later,
one FBI agent suggested that I had worked for the Chinese).

The registered letter that was dispatched at my instance to FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover in September 1963 (not necessarily on the

13th) revealed sufficient details to warrant an immediate investiga~ |

tion (if. not the arrest) of Lee Harvey Oswald and two. Cuban refugees.

I certainly "assumed" that some “action” would be taken by. the FBI.

I was not the least bit “frantic” about anything in September 1963.
I did not set foot inside the Republic of Cuba during that month.

fo my knowledge I have never talked to any "Castro aides." The main
distinction between some American intelligence officers that.I knew
and hired killers were the procedures utilized in murdering their
victims and/or the methods used to disassociate’ chee ee and the -
U. S. government from their crimes.

I. had no fear of being implicated "in the. planned assassination" ie

-the time of my arrest or prior thereto.

“The two letters that I mailed to James L- Rankin, General Counsel to

_-with Lee Harvey Oswald taken in Jackson Sauare in New Orleans in 196
I have never stated that I am “willing to surface and tell (any) story] _

the Warren Commission, were not sent through “private channels." They}
were sent through proper jail authority. :

I have never claimed. that I “squirreled away a snapshot of (myself)

to: Congress". or to. anybody. And I did! not reveal any details about
Mr. Oswald to Professor Popkin that are "new" or unknown to the FBI.

Bank robber, ‘Manchurian Candidate’

linked to JFK assassination probe

ED, NOTE: Recent exposure of
what many consider to be im-
proper CIA activity, both at
home and abroad, has
reawakened interest in decade-
old'challenges to official ver-
sions of the assassinations of

* Jahn Kennedy, Robert Kennedy

and Martin Luther King. As new.
facts also begin to emerge,
Congress faces growing
Pressure to reinvestigate the

- JFK assassination.

What follows are the strange
Stories, disclosed here tor the
first time, of two figures —
Richard Case Nagel! and Luis
Angel Castillo — long of interest:
to assassination researchers.

WILLIAM W. TURNER
— On Sept.
20, 1963, a rangy man with a
verfical scar on his forehead

_ Strode into the State National

Bank in El Paso, Tex., and re-

- quested $100 in travelers’

schecks. Before the teller could
comply, he whipped out a pistol
and fired two shots into the ceil-
ing. Then he waited to be
arrested.

Police quickly realized that
the suspect, Richard Case
Nagell, 32, was no ordinary
bank robber. Papers he carried
showed that he was a decorated

~ hero of the Korean War who had

gone on to a career in Army
Intelligence before being dis-
charged with the rank of captain
in 1959.

Why had he pated the non-
robbery?

Last. week Or. Richard H.

Popkin, a philosophy professor

at Washington University in St. :

Louis, stepped off a plane in the
nation's capital lugging a brief-
case containing documents -:il-
luminating the strange case of
the man who shot a bank. Also
crammed into the briefcase was
a thick sheaf of papers relating
to a bizarre “Manchurian Can-
didate” episode in the Philip-
pines in 1967.

Both the El Paso and Manila
incidents, Popkin: said-in an in-
terview before ‘leaving for
Washington, were linked to the
Dallas assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. They
would “crack the case wide

« open,” he predicted.

The slight, bearded academi-
cian was stopping in
Washington to present his dis-
coveries to Attorney. General
Edward Levi and the Senate
Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities before go-
ing on to a conference of learn-
ed philosophers.

The Second Oswald

Popkin is no stranger to the
“JFK investigation. In. 1966 he
published The Second Oswald,
which chronicled several in-
Stances of someone imper-
sonating the man later accused
of slaying the president. At the
time the book gained scant
attention, but recently it was dis-
closed that as early as June 3,
1960, FB! Director J. Edgar
Hoover himself .wrote an in-
terdepartmental_ memorandum

citing evidence of an- Oswald ©.

imposter. The FBI knew Oswald
at that
Russia,- and, some conspiracy
theorists believe, as a possible
CIA agent.

Popkin said he had. been in
touch with Richard Nagell, now
living near San Diego, and had
learned about Nagell's
friendship with Lee Harvey
Oswald. Nagell has fascinated
assassination researchers ever
since an FBI report filed with the
Warren Commission. quoted
him as saying he had met with
Oswald in Mexica.City and Tex~
as. But the former intelligence
officer had been inacessible. He
remained in prison for the Et
Paso caper until his conviction
was reversed for insufficient
evidence in 1967, after which he
dropped from sight.

Nagell’s Version

Nevertheless, researchers.
were able to glean some picture
of Nagell's significance from his
defense pleadings and cryptic»
letters fram prison. iu

In August 1963 Nagell, work~
ing as a CIA agent, learned of a
domestic plot to. assassinate the
president, involving Oswald and
anti-Castro ‘Cubans. He in-

le as a defector to.

formed his CIA superior but.

feared nothing would be done
because he lacked details. On
Sept. 13 he dispatched a letter
warning J. Edgar Hoover of the
plot but again assumed no ac-

tion would be taken.
As Nagell understood. it,
Kennedy was to be shot.in
(please, turn to page 33)



INATION

(continued trom’, _,@ 4)

Washington about Sept. 26 (as
it turned out, JFK left Sept. 25
for a whirlwind tour of the West).
Frantic, Nagell flew to Havana
on Sept. 19 to see if Castro
aides could shed light on the
assassination plot, but the only
advice they could offer was to:
execute Oswald in the hope that
would stop the plan.

« But Nagell left Cuba deciding
that he “was an intelligence

_ agent, not a killer." Flying to El

Paso via Mexico City, he walked
into the bank the next day for
“the sole purpose of having
myself arrested and detained by
federal authorities" — ap-
parently. fearing that his
association with Oswald would

implicate himself in the planned.

assassination.
Nagell was In the El Paso jail
when Kennedy was shot In

* Dallas two months later. He sent

an offer to testify before the
Warren Commission through
“private channels” but received
no reply.
Dedicated Leftist

In his recent discussions with
Popkin, Nagell has revealed
new details about Oswald. He
first met Oswald, he said, in the
late fifties at the U.S. naval base
at Atsugi, Japan, where Oswald
was a Marine Corps radar

_ Specialist. They became friends

but didn’t encounter one
another again until August 1963

when Nagell learned of the plot

against Kennedy.

“Disputing claims that Oswald
had ties with the CIA, Nagell
belleves that Oswald was a
dedicated leftist who was duped
by anti-Castro exiles involved in
the conspiracy. Posing as
Castro G-2 intelligence agents,
the exiles wheedled Oswald into
becoming a “fall guy" by playing
‘on his Castro sympathies, pain-
ting Kennedy as anti-Castro and
promising that he would be
Spirited to Havana after the
assassination.

Nageli told Popkin he met
with Oswald both in Mexico Clty
and New Orleans, hotbeds of
the anti-Castro movement.
“Nagell claims he has squirrel-
ed away a snapshot of himself
with Lee Harvey Oswald taken
in Jackson Square in New
Orleans in 1963," Popkin as-
serted. “in the picture are two
other men, both anti-Castro
Cubans, who were pretending

if this photograph does exist
it would lend credibility”
Nagell's account. And Ne” is.
willing to surface amd te ais
story to Congress, Popkin says,
provided protective conditions
are met.

“Manchurian Candidate”

Pookin is also convinced that
the Manila “Manchurian Can-
didate” case was connected to
the JFK assassination. On
March 2, 1967, a man named
Luis Angel Castillo was detain-
‘ed by the Philippine National
Bureau of Investigation after he
had contacted left-wing. Huk
guerrillas. Questioned under
truth serum and hypnosis.
Castillo blurted outa tale of hav~
ing been taken to a building in
Dallas, Tex., the day Kennedy
was shot, handed a rifle
assembled from components
hidden in a bowling bag and in-
structed to fire at a man in an
open car sitting next to a lady.
The signal to fire would be given
by mirror flashes.

The story caused a brief sen-
sation at the time. The Manila
Times bannered: " ‘JFK Plotter’
in Manila!" Wire service dis-
patches to. the United States
said Castillo was a “Cuban-
trained Communist agent" who
hadn’t shot because he heard
that a man named Joe “had
already shot the man in the
‘open car." The story was so im-
Plausible that it quickly died.

Not long ago the hypnotist
who conducted the interroga-
tion of Casiilo for the Philippina
authorities arrived in this coun-
try under the name: Vincente R.
Sanchez. When Popkin took a
fook at his reports, his eyes
popped.

The reports termed Castillo a
“zombie’ — ai hyp-
noprogrammed robot.

Double-Agent Network

Sanchez extracted Castillo's
rambling story over a period of
weeks. Castillo, then 28, was in-
ducted around 1960 into a
“Special Operations Group”
which afforded him paramifitary
training. in 1961 he participated
in the Bay of Pigs invasion, as a
pilot for the CIA. Thereafter he
infiltrated a double-agent
network, posing as a Com--
munist in Venezuela and li-
quidating a.Communist agentin
Mexico. . .

In talking about the JFK
assassination, Castillo —'
despite some disjointed
phrases — was nevertheless
able to describe in some detail

ordered, “They got him already.
Let's get out of here." After the
rifle was disassembled and
stuffed in the bowling bag, he
was hustled into the car which
had breught him to tne building.
It stopped twice within blocks to
pick up other men.

In 1967, according to
Sanchez, Castillo ‘was
programmed to assassinate
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos after openly associating
with the leftist Huks — which
would implicate them tn the
assassination. Popkin points
out that this is a similar play to
the ane Nagell attributed to the
anti-Castra Cubans’ use of
Oswald.” :

Until recently. the Castitio
episode might have seemed a
logcial impossibility. But the
release of the Rockefeller
Report, with its revelations
about secret CIA projects to in-
duce behavior modification In
unsuspecting subjects, make
the possibility of a “Manchurian
Candidate" more than mere
fantasy. {In the Robert Kennedy
assassination, Dr. Bernard Dia-
mond, who examined Sirhan
Sirhan for the defense. testified
that he believed Sirhan was
hypnotized at the time of the
shooting.)

Although the current
whereabouts of Castillo is un-
known, the Sanchez reports
contain the names of six per-
sons who supposedly ran his
network, including the “control
officer” and a woman who hyp~
notized him. Popkin's awn in-

vestigations have shown that...

these people do exist.

Through Popkin their stories”
have now been passed on to the
Attorney General and the
Church Committee.

William Turner's latest book,
The Cuba Project, the story of
the CIA's secret war against
Castro, will be published this tail
by Houghton Mitflin. (ae

SOURCE:

1968 RAMPARTS
Article by William
W. TURNER

OS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject became of interest to the Office of Security in March 1964
when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at
the time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September
1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured
‘by the Chinese Commmists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency
employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these
names in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably
unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted
by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington,
D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October
1962. His. file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these
are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints
stemming foam the plarecrash. .Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965
made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this
security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL be personally
interviewed by a representative, of OS in the hope that NAGELL might reveal
how he came into the possessi: ese names but no further action is indicated
in his file and this interview was not undertaken.

DETAILS:

Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964
when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested
for bank robbery.

The RAMPARTS claim that he received intelligence. training after the plane......
erash is true. The crash‘oceurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from
Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He
served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U. 6S. Army Counterintelligence
Corps, terminating-about 1958. A Lt. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with
NAGELL personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and
that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane
crash. :

The RAMPARTS article's claim that NAGELL said he fired the gun in the

‘bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination

took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on
1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of
chronology)

The RAMPARTS article's allegation. that the FBI took from NAGELL a note~

Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this

Meanwhile the CIA got wind of the

“an ‘intelligence asvigninent in Latin America, has urged me

and East. Germany. For reasons that, are more personal than
advisable I can think of little else that I would like to do

better. But with the copious amount of documentation and °

‘writing no less’ than a tome, an undertaking for which I am
hardly qualified. . Then, too, there is a growing, skepticism

ew yy. 4B UVRKDEAD FaMibi ariicié, i have not soughi vo reiuce or
“‘gonfirm each and every avsertion made ty its author,-Thomas C. Lucey. Mr. Lucey, despite

his citing a substantial number of inaccuracies, has nonetheless depicted a vast ared of

what may be termed the fundamental truth. With this in nind, I-have tried to set/the
_ record straight only insofer as it pertains to “those inaccuracies - and omissions
Baise which in my opinion reflect adversely on the whole.

In order to view Mr. Lucey's account in a somewhat different perspective, I s] hall
begin by advising that I first went. to work for the Central Intelligence Agency much
earlier than August 1962. It was during the winter of 1955-56, while assigned as a Gase
7 Review Officer with the Counter Intelligence: Corps at Los Angeles, that I was initially

recruited into the CIA's farflung network of informants and agents, one of a number| I

suppose, within the Defense Department's .intelligence community who helped the Agency
keep an eye on its not always tame competitor. My recruitment wes, handled by a Hertert

Leibacher, an agent of the ClA's Los Angeles office, and a Joe DaVanon, later identified

‘to me through photographs. as en official from CIA headquerters, then loceted on|"E"
‘-ietreet in Washington, D.C. Wotiveted by a degree of naivete and the Agency's subtle
eminders that I owed a greater duty to my country than to the military establishment, I
jeerved as o- non-paid, confidential informant off and on until my resignation from |the
Army.in October 1959. A complete destription of the information I supplied to the Agency
during my military career would only add to what must perforce become a lengthy addendum;
‘may it suffice to say chat it_did not always seem germane to intelligence affairs, |but
-when it did it consisted mainly of an assortment of data that for so-called discretionary
reasons was seldom passed on to the. Agency. (or for that matter, to our own higher
echelons). through regular channels.

Mr. Lucey's statement, “Being married “to a foreign national meant an automatic
removal from intelligence work so Nagell decided to leave the Army,” is misleading |and
incorrect in. its entirety. The only military intelligence organization from which an
individual is normally removed subsequent to marrying a foreign national is the cic -
primarily a@ security type orgen = and this rule does not necessarily apply when the agent
is an enlisted man or warrant officer. As a commissioned officer, I was declared
ineligible for further duty with the CIC effective 14 April 1959, a full year after my
morriege to a foreign national. I was not barred from assignment to other, even more
sensitive, MI organizations such as Field Operations’ Intelligence, then the clandestine
espionage depsrtment of military intelligence. . As for the reasons I left the Army, they
were clearly if euphemisticelly explained in my second letter of resignation, dated.
$1 August 1959, namely: "I desire to tender my resignation because I wish to further my |
civilian, education. It is not possible for me-to pursue the curriculum of which I am
desirous while on active duty. Also, compessionate reasons of a personal nature exist
for desiring to tender my resignation at this time." 7

My patronege under the CIA did not end with my.discharyve from the Army and ensuing
employment in. December 1959 as an investigator forthe State of California; in fact,
henceforth I was offered remuneration for my services, however nominal it sometimes was.
What my new .taske comprised is of no real pertinence to this addendum or to later

. developments, except perhaps to mention that one of my. contacts said he worked out of
"Domestic Intelligence," possibly the forerunner of the present~ day Domestic Operations
Division, which illegally keeps tabs on a wide range of American civilian organizations
‘and activities. -I should elso point out that I did not quit my position with the State
of California “to work for the CIA,” as implied by Mr. Lucey. I was dismissed, in June ‘
£1962, at my own option and in my opinion for doing my job. (The following month I was
“shot through the right chest during an altercation with a person whose identity I have
never disclosed ... + not through the left chest by myself, my wife, un Alcoholic
Beverage Control. inspector then under investigation or by a Los Angeles police officer
"because of communistic. implications," as has been reported at verious times by various

sources).

For the next year, from approximately the middle of August 1962 until my arrest in



13-00000

(
Texas on 20 September 19( I was employed by. the ‘agency in-a-capecity which can be
adcurately described as that of an egent, in every sense of the word. My asaignménts
varied and necessitated travel to three Latin American nations and many states, including
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. They also necessitated my taking on cover employment
. for one week in’ New York and for about ten weeks in Los Angeles, though usually I peed
as a tourist, an investigator for" the Immigration & Naturalization Service or 4s a
_ researcher for a private firm, the appropriate credentials being furnished to me by|the
CIA. . To sum it up briefly, I operated in Mexico City at the onset of the Cuban Missile
‘Crisis in an effort aimed chiefly at. the Soviet government; I conducted inquities
relative to "dissident": members of several Cuban refugee groups based in the United.
States; I checked out’ an’ alleged connection between a Miami resident named Eladio |Del-
Valle and New Orleans CIA informant Sergio Arcacha=Smith; I investigated an associate of
the now deceased right-wing .extremist David Ws Ferrie of New Orleans, as I did|the~
-activities. of left-wingers Vaughn L. Snipes’ and his wife,. Priscilla, near Venice,
California, and others; I conducted a surveillance on a man, said to have been an ex-CIA
employee, observed talking to MRP leader Manuel Artime and former Cuban senator/racketeer
Rolando Masferrer; I inquired into an allegation that Marina Oswald intended to divorce
her husband and return to the U.S.S.R. (although I never stated that I. met her personal ly,
aS was reported by the FBI and Secret Service); and I performed courier duties and adted
“as a cut-out. At the time of my arrest I was operating in an undercover ‘role, having
become involved in a. domestic-inspired plot to assassinate President Kennedy and,
leastwise ostensibly, other highly-placed government officials. i

es Mr. Lucey goes on. to “state that my last ‘assignment at the time "was to penetrate the
Feir Play for Cuba Committee, where he met Oswald." Such statement is also -incorrect.| I
was never a member, .bona-fide or otherwise, : of the FPCC. And my conversations with HPCC
functionaries like Steve Roberts, .an .official of the Socialist Workers Party a: fae
Angeles, could hardly: be construed as a penetration. Furthermore, I had been introduced
to Mr. Oswald long-before the FPCC came into. existence, albeit under an assumed name.

As to the allusion that. I. told “Bob” I was an intelligence man, not a killer,

jtherefore- I couldn't: kill -Mr. ‘Oswald, while the reference is true its connotation! is.
deceptive. I had killed before and I had participated in homicides under the auspices of
both MI and the CIA (one instance being the part I. played in the February 1958 abductipn=
“interrogation-murder of an FOI agent, a U.S. soldier, MSGT Emmett E. Dugan, from Crafton,
“Pas, suspected of. having defected in place to the Chinese), under the guise that] an
American variation of the Soviet “wet affair" was the. only alternative, that it was
either essential to some overall intelligence effort or in the best interestsof. our,
inational security.’ And it was a similar-sounding argument, ultimately reduced to a
‘threat, that was advanced to me‘by Robert Graham.as an incentive to dispose of Mr. Oswald |
jin September 1963, . But my refusal to do so had absolutely no bearing on‘the reason for °-
effecting my arrest in the manner I chose, nor did it engender in me fear of reprisal by "|
the CIA. in : 5

Pertaining to my arrest. and convictions at El Paso, Texas, which the official
“spokesmen andthe press have so neatly labeled as being for “bank robbery,” let one of
the government's own spurious records,. the appelate court decision that finally yawned a |
judgement of acquittal in my case, give its version: “The charge was then, and is now, .|
entering a federally insured bank with intent to rob." What the record aptly ignores is
the. fact that two juries, incensed by the prosecution's innuendoes in and out of the
courtroom (and by the ramifications of perjured testimony and a false Bureau of Prisons
“report made availeble to the jury during its deliberations at the second trial - though
never formally admitted into evidence) that I was a Communist, no doubt a very red spy,
twice convicted me. of having ,"intended" to take by force and violence one hundred dollars
worth of Travelers Cheques from a bank teller.

subjected by a corrupt judicial system, nor shall I bother:to enumerate the cruelties

Myat of them are adequal, x “detailed in my 1967 Memorandum in Support of Petition ‘for
“Writ Of Habeas Corpus, sworn to and subscribed before William R. Martin (a former member
of the CIA's Dirty Tricks Division, who by his own admission is still in “the reserved"),
But I shall opine that if President Kennedy had not met his demise when and where he did,
I would not have been brought to trial on charges of commiting a felony.

While my return to the fold of the CIA in May 1968 may have been the only “practilcal
“thing” for me to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, os a lfew
old bank account passbooks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary that lr. Lucey
has portrayed). Nor was it because of any peculiar allegiance to those who had tossed me
on the scrap heap for the sake of expediency 44 years earlier, love of country, ions a
tic tendencies, or wont of further intrigue. . And’ while it remains axiomatic in my. mind
that the sole requisite for one's use by the Agency is his qualification to fit into
whatever may happen to be.the scheme of things, even this did not apply in| my
circumstance, not really. I agreed to go back out into the cold, so to speak, strictly
for personal reasons and I think the explanation is wisely left at that for now.

ii My mission inside East. Germany - if indeed it wes a mission - was neither as well-
defined nor as elementary as Mr. Lucey lias perceived. I am eure the CIA knows all] it
needs to know about American defectors in Berlin and the modus operandi of the MfS. In
; fact, the mission was net directed against East Germany, per se. . Preparations bore the
trademarks of an authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the main to another
nation. That I was unable to comprehend the German language, that I had been a recent,
i unwilling guest of the U.S. Attorney General, branded a Communist in the public records,
ete., merely served to strengthen an already plausible cover built up by chance rather
| than by design. Paradoxically, the chinks in the armor were that the cover was not
wholly untrue, “the MfS (unlike the FBI) not in the least irresponsible to the laws and
policies of its government. In the past I had engaged in certain covert intelligence
{activities hositie to other socialist states, to. which - as an integral part of |my
cover - I freely confessed. Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely had neglected
to tell me during the briefings that these previous activities constituted a violationjof
the criminal statutes of the GDR, warranting @ maximum penalty of death upon conviction. ©
By inadvertence or by plan I found myself in a not altogether unfamiliar predicament. [If
I had confessed to my real mission,: assuming that it was genuine, without doubt I would’
have been spared execution, probably even escaped long-term imprisonment. Instead,
selected what I considered to be a better alternative . .. - and gained my freedom. ls
for my treatment by the MfS, from begining to end it was far more gentle than that
experienced beneath the cudgel of the U.S. Department of Justice. : eee | are

i
i With regard to my marital status and my.children, the foremost area that Mr. Lucey

appears to have exploited, I have never claimed that "Uncle Sam hides my, family" or. |.
[epee that FBI and CIA agents’ ‘deliberately isolated me from my wife and children; nor
| have I claimed that the Agency used the promise of reuniting me with my family as part of
pthe incentive for accepting the assignment in the GDR. My accusations in this respect
‘ centered around my children and they were leveled at. the State Department as the result
: pot & promise made to me shortly after my release from the GDR. Since returning to the
; United States last spring a reliable source has informed me that my wife was granted a
' tinal decree of divorce at some period during-my imprisonment in the USA and although I
thave never been served with a copy of the decree or other notification of divorce (or
notice of a divorce hearing) T gee no cause to dispute the advisement.

Lastly, concerning the aspersions cast on my sanity, at this writing permit me to
4 jay only that. I have never. in my life been certified psychotic by any U.S. medical

jauthority or adjudicated mentally-incompetent in a-court of law, notwithstanding the

conflicting legal. and medical opinions as to my mental condition on the day of ny errest

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case -. #264170

REF: State Dept. Airgram No. A-903 from Berlin - Subject: Psychiatrist's
Report on Richard Case NAGELL, U. S. Citizen Released by GDR

Reference airgram furnishes background information on Subject and
fills in gaps in the chronology of events in Subject's life of interest
to the Agency...Of particular note is the fact that Subject was acquitted
om 29 April 1968 after his. claim of temporary insanity at the time of
the crime found support in the expert testimony of a noted American
neurologist, Dr.. Edwin WEINSTEIN. An article in the January 1968 issue
of RAMPARTS by William W. TURNER implied that NAGELL had been involved
in the assassination plot against President KENNEDY and that he had been
“salted away". Subject denied any involvement in any conspiracy and denied
that he had any information of use to GARRISON. Subject alleged that his
fear that the CIA might try to "eliminate" him was planted in his mind by
Mr. GARRISON. . (See page 2.of interview report). On page 3 of the interview
report Subject states he no longer believes that it is realistic to think that the
CIA was trying k111 him.

Berlin who in ewed Subject, was granted a continuing liaison clearance -.~- ~:
on 17 October 1968 at the Fequest of ‘DDP/E/G/Is.

interviews the Washington, D.C. law firm of NEW, MACKEY and
GEORGE. Newspaper clippings from the WASHINGTON STAR for 17 March 1966
and the NEW YORK TIMES for 29 August 1965 reflect that NICEY has been
associated with East Berlin attorney, Wolfgang VOGEL and West Berlin
attorney, Juergen STANGE, in a number of cases involving the release

of Americans from East Germany. According to an FBI report dated 3
February 1967 these releases usually involved the payment of specified
sums of money and VOGEL and STANGE were allegedly reaping large monetary
benefits for their services.

Joseph Frances Davanon, and John Richard Sloss ell stated te the best
of their knowledge they had never met Nagell. It is popsible, however,
that Magell knew or knew of Parker, Gharchill, and Guthrie through
their work in the Far Ezat. Aa for Leibacker and Davanon, Nagell
lived in Los Angeles in 1962.

10. On 16 April 1964 Nagell sent to the FB a letter claiming ©
that in September 1963 he had sent to the Bureau a registered letter
signed "Jack Kramer". The 1964 letter implied that the 1963 letter
had warned the FBI about the impending aseaseination. The FBI, of 6
course, did not receive euch & letter. .

ll. In January 1968 William T. Turner stated in an article in
Ramparts, "The Garrison Commission on the Assassination of



13-00000

President Kennedy", p. 56, that Nagell was then etill confined

at Leavenworth, that he had been a highly decorated infantry captain
in the Korean War, and that he clalmed to have become.a CIA agent
thereafter. Ramparts shifted the plane crash in which Nagell was
injured from 195¢ and Maryland to 1957 and Cambodia. The article
repeated the allegation that he staged a phony holdup in order to be
under arreat when the assassination occurred,

12, On @ June 1968 the American Consulate in Zurich cabled
Washington to say that Richard Cane Nagell, passport J 543069, bad
appeared at the consulate on 4 June and had said that he was working
for a secret U.S. Government agency on a mission to Geneva, where
he was to meet some Japanese. He asked for money. He returned to
the consulate the next day, was incoherent, and seemed psychotic. He
claimed that on 14-16 May 1966 be had been interviewed by District
Attorney Jim Garrison. He said that Garrison had warned him that he
was in danger of being killed and that he wanted to inform CIA that he
was in Zurich.

13. On 7 September 1968 another William Turner piece was
printed by Ramparts under the heading “ / Assaceinations / Epstein's
Garrison.” it referred te Nagell ae a former U.S. intelligence agent
and repeated much the same story that it had teld in January, Turner
and Ramparts may have been unaware that Nagell was out of jail by then.

14. On 25 October 1968 the Washington Post reported that aftet-------
holding Nagell for four months, the East Germans had released him
on 23 October at an East-West Berlin cros#ing-point. Nagell left-by
plane for the U.S. on 25 Getober. “Informed sources” said that Nagell
was taken off a train en route through East Germany to Berlin because
he made some remarks which the Kast Germans considered derogatory.

15. On 31 October 1968 State forwarded the text of 2 report by a
U. &. Army péychiatrist who examined Nagell on 23 October. Nagell
said that he was on active duty with the army from 1948 to 1959 and that
from 1953 to 1959 he was an officer in military intelligence. He also
provided accurate information about the 1954 plane crash and ite results --
among them, in his own words, hie "unstable persouality and immature
or impulsive behaviour". He said that he draws 64% disability pay. He
lost bie job in California because one night in 1962, while drunk, he tried
to break down the door of the apartment of his estranged wife.

After his confused attempt in 1963 to rob the E] Paso bank, he
spent 41/2 yeare in prison. He was examined by Dr. Edwin Weinstein,



13-00000

_ anpted American neurologist, who found his electroencephalograms

abnormal, and ae 4 redult he was reledsed from prison on 29 April 1968.

Nagel said that because of the Ramparts article of January 1968 he
was paid a visit by Jim Garrison. He told Garrison that he had no
information of any use to him. The interview left him,. however, with
twofenrs: that Garrison might try to subpoens him and that CIA might
try to "“sHmingte™ him, (By the time he was providing this information
sa Berlin Nagell was well aware that he wae not involved in any conspiracy
to assassinate President Kennedy.) He said that his fear of CIA was
planted fa hie mind by Mr. Garrison.

SIRHAN’S MOTIVES

Unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan
has lived ta tell of his motivations— but he
hax chosen to remain silent. The only other
potential. souree of info¥mation is his

” family, which had not spoken to the press.

Mahmoud Abdel-Hadl, an Egyptian
correspondent for Akhbar Elyoun in
Cairo, recently gained access to Sirhan's
. Based upon information supplied
the family, he has written exclusiv

Iv for Ramparts the following account
of Sithan’s motivations and the strategy
he plans for his trial.

Because of the forthcoming trial and
the difficulty of dealing with this subject
without emotional involvement, the editors
of Ramparts have elected to present this
itiformation of historic interest to our
readers without display, and in as ob-
Jective a form as possible.

FCAUSE TAM AN ARAB T was able to
B breuk through the barrier of sus-

picion that had ‘stopped other
Journalists cold and obtain the first in-
‘depth interviews the Sirhan family has
given since the assassination. From their
comments and from what Sirhan has said
to them, a picture of the man and his
motives begins to emerge, replacing the
misleading portraits which have swamped
the U.S. press.

The fact that Sirhan has not publicly
discussed his trial is no accident..[t is his
‘own strategy, something he developed
after thinking aboui it for jong hours in
his ‘specially made jail cell. In fact, he
has confided to his family that he will
ke any statement unless special
provisions are made for the courtroom
proceedings, What Sirhan wants is,
quite simply, publicity. He wants the
major television networks to be allowed
to broadcast the entire trial. If they do
this, he says, he will tell all. And if they
refuse?" his brother Adel recently asked
him. “Then I shall goto the gas chamber
silent," Sirhan replied.

voracious reader, Sirhan is confident
about his own ability to cope with his
predicament. His eldest brother, Shereif,
told me that Sithan studies the intrica-
cies of his case as many as ten hours a
day in his cell Shereif recalls that Sirhan
recently said to him, “I do not need a
lawyer. I understand my case und know
how to defend myself."’ But even so,
Attorney Russell Parsons is defending
his client, and doing it on Sirhan’s own
grounds. “The main issue,” Parsons told
me, “is to answer this question: why, for
what reason, did Sirhan kill Robert
Kennedy? There are 100 witnesses who
saw Sirhan shooting Mr. Kennedy, but
no one seems to know why he did it.”

Sirhan and his attorney hope that the
defense—presuming that the television
networks are allowed into. the court-
room--will show that Sirhan did not
have “malice aforethought" in shoot-
ing Kennedy because the act was a.polit-.
ical gesture, and that Kennedy, to Sirhan
fat least, was merely a symbol, His
brother Adel notes that “if Sirhan was
just an assassin, he could have done it in
another way, just by having a gun with a
telescope. He went to the Ambassador
Hotel expecting to get caught; that is
why he left his notes at home. I believe
that Sirhan wanted to get caught so that
he could say what he believes.”

1 finully obtained an invitation to mect

This family, which fled Jordan to seek
greater safety and security than it had
known, is now living in terror. They are
somewhat at a loss to understand the

death follows them everywhere, and they
move carefully, with a heavy guard,
“Why con't you just leave this country?"
Pasked Shere ‘Where shall we go?”
he answered, “To whom shall we leave
our brother? Our land is under Israel's
occupation.” Shereif clarified his state-
ment: “Our brother is in jail; we have to
stay.”

I sensed not only the Sirhans’ con-
fusion, but also some bitterness. They
have not-received any aid from the Arab
countries, as they originally thought they
might. Parsons is’ also somewhat sur-
prised; he had hoped that the various
local Arab cqnsulates would help defray
court costs, j

Indeed, Los Angeles’ Jordanian con-
sul, who visited Sirhan in jail at Sirhan’s
request, indicated to me that the accused
assassin hadjexpected the Arab people
to treat him as a hero. However, except
for some Palestinian extremists, his act
has been universally repudiated by the
Arab world. One Arab newspaper has
said editorially, “‘We don’t feel any

responsibility for this. It is the society _

that fed him with hostility, the society
that gave him the gun, that is responsi-
ble.” Members of the Arab Students’
Association, ‘of which ‘Sirhan was once
an officer, feel that the killing of Kennedy
was a terriblé mistake. One of them suid

Still, the Sirhuns’ friends are primarily
Arab, and they five in an atmosphere
that is more Arab than American. The
entire fumily spent a good deu! of time
discussing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The
mother says. that Sirhan was the most
sensitive and the most involved during
these discussions, Adel says that Sirhan
once saw a television report of Robert
Kennedy addressing the members of the
Neveh Shalom Temple in Portland,
Oregon. While in the synagogue, Ken-
nedy, wearing a yarmulke, declared that
the United States must help Israel
against aggression from whatever source,

“Unlike the South Vietnamese,” Ken-
nedy said, “the Israelis have shown they
are willing to fight for their own survival.
Indeed, Israel is the very opposite of
Vietnam: the Israeli government is very
democratic, effective and free of corrup-
tion. Its people are united in its support.”
‘The senator then urged the Johnson Ad-
ministration to proceed at once with the
sale of 50’ Phantom jet fighters to: the
fsruell Air Force and to cut off economic
aid to the Anib countries. this whole
episode nude Sichuan very angry, Shereif
recalls. “He left the room putting his

thought her son had shot Kennedy.
“Everything in this country was helping
Sirhan,” she maintained. “It was push-
ing him to the danger point. Everything,
the propaganda of the Zionists, every-
thing, was against his country, against
his people.”

Adel described Sirhan’s current state
of mind: “He feels he has done a terrible
thing, but he feels now it is too late to be
sorry. Now he wants Americans to listen
to something thcy have never listened
to."

And at their first meeting in the jail,
Sirhan’s mother suid to him, “Shame or

EPSTEIN’S GARRISON

I gated that work to the fiction
section of your local library. The first
was Mark Lane's Rush to Judgment,
which convincingly demonstrated—us-
ing the Warren Commission's own evi-
dence—that Oswald could not have done
it alone, and drew the first dim outlines
of the conspiracy theory. The second
was Edwatd Jay Epstein’s Inquest, which
exposed the rather shoddy inner work-
ings of the Commission and laid bare the

tortured logic it finally employed to dis-

pel notions of a conspiracy.
Both books became best sellers, but
their authors have since gone different

Manuscript published in the United
States (it was first published in Britain),
has stumped the country in support of
District Attorney Jim Garrison's theory
that the assassination was curried out by
uo anti-Casiro paramilitary team super-

vised by persons with cia affiliations,
Epstein, whose book was a converted
Cornell University master’s thesis—the
subject was urged upon him by his men-
tor, Andrew Hacker—has emerged as
one of Garrison's most fervid accusers.
His vehicle is The New Yorker: in the
issue of July 13, he delivered a 25,000-

word blast at Garrison, calling the DA's

investigation a fraud.

The New Yorker article had its genesis
over a year ago, when the author showed.
up at Garrison's office in New Orleans.
According’ to Chief Investigator Louis
Ivon, Epstein spent about 48 hours in
town, some three hours at the office, and
hasn't been seen since, Much of what he
writes about has occurred since this
touch-and-go visit and is obviously hear-
say on his part, yet he writes with the
authoritative tone of a participant. Un-
doubtedly this technique is convincing
to his audience, which assumedly is un-
familiar with the intricacies of Garrison's
investigation. But to those familiar with
the facts, the article is badly slanted.

For example, Philosophy Professor
Richard. Popkin of the University. of
California at San Diego, author of the
book The Second Oswald (propounding
the theory of an Oswald double) and
“Garrison's Case” in The New York
Review of Books (September 14, 1967),
recently commented on the article:

“TI found it a queer mix of facts, half
facts, rumors and very dubious informa-
tion from people hostile to Garrison.
Epstein has compressed all this to make
it look Jike everything's on the same
level. 1 think it would take an awful lot
of work to disentangle what he's saying
‘on almost any page as to how much of
it has a factual base, how much of it is
rumor that he has heard from people,
how much of it are charges that have
been made by people like [William] Gur-
vich [who volunteered to work on the
investigation without pay, passed him-
self off as. the Chief Investigator, then

«turned on Garrison] against. Garrison,

which haven't been substantiated any-
where except by Gurvich’s statement of
them. And also that he tends to take
facts and information and rumors and so
on, that occurred over a year and a half's
period, and compress them all into
simultaneous events, so that a statement
made ‘by Garrison at one’ time is
pounced upon on the basis of informa-
tion or statements he made « year und a
half later in a totally different context,

So E think it's u quite unfair presentae
tion, which has some factunl base, but
which also has a lot of very dubious
elements in it."

One of the dubious ‘elements is Ep-
stein’s version, of the testimony of Dean
Andrews Jr.,-a colorful attorney who
numbers among his former clients Os-
wald (who wanted his undesirable dis-
charge from the Marine Corps rectified)
and the late David William Ferrie, a
central figure in the Garrison investiga-
tion. The day after the assassination,
Andrews told the Commission he _re-
ceived a phone call from a man he knew .
as Clay Bertrand, whom he described as
a “lawyer without a briefcase” for local
homosexuuls. Bertrand asked him to go
to Dallas and defend Oswald. Garrison.
contends Bertrand is Clay Shaw, whom
he has charged with conspiracy.

According ,to Epstein, Andrews ini-
tially gave the. Fur “several different de-
scriptions” of Bertrand, and finally ad-
mitted that Bertrand “twas merely a
figment of his imagination.” Later, be-
fore the Commission, Andrews stated
that he had fecently seen Bertrand in a
bar and, Epstein says, described him as
“a boy” who, was “five feet eight inches”
and had “‘sandy hair.” “No other clues
to Bertrand’s identity turned up, how-
ever,” writes Epstein, “and Wesley J.
Liebeler, a Commission lawyer who con-
ducted the investigation in this arca, said
he was convinced that no such person
existed.”

An objective reading’ of “Andrews “~~

testimony, fowever, reveals that he
told the Far that Bertrand was“approxi-
mately six feet one inch to six feet two
inches in height, brown hair, and well
dressed"—a' description that closely .
matches thg tall, aristocratic Shaw. As
for Bertrand being a figment of his
imagination, Andrews declared, “That's
what the Feebees [Fat] put on.” He re-
counted that G-men had pestered him
to the point where he told them, “Write
what you want, that I am nuts. I-don’t
care.” As for his later remark: to the
Commission's Mr. Liebeler that Ber-
trand was only five feet, eight. inches,
Andrews explained that “this time I was.
looking for the fellow, he was sitting
down.” Nowhere does he refer to’ Ber-
trand as a “boy.” Epstein was perhaps
confused by his exclamation: “I don’t
play Boy Scout and measure them.”
In his superficial examination of Gur-

rison’s case, Epstein evidently failed to
check the police records prepared upon
Shaw's arrest, Thoroughly shaken. by the
arrest, Shaw blurted out, according to

in Mexico City in 1963, and had been
instructed by his spy superiors to deter-

attempt had any foundation. Nagell says
he learned that the first attempt against
Kennedy was scheduled for September
26 in Washington, D.C., and that Oswald
(who crossed the border into Mexico the
‘rday® before). Was to. -be* set tipas' the
“patsy” and shot in front of the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City. When the anti-
Castro paramilitary team could not
penetrate the Presidential security in
Wastiington, Oswald got a reprieve. But
Nagel, who says he was sure the attempt
would come off but failed to get the Fat
o listen, faked a bank robbéry in El
Paso on September 20 so that he would
be arrested and in federal custody when
the assassination:occurred.

Epstein dismisses.-Nagell as being
mentally unbalanced, noting that “court
records indicated that Nagell had suf-
fered brain damage in an airplane crash
in 1957” and that, following the bank
episode, he was.“‘an inmate of a federal
institution for the criminally insane in
Springfield, Missouri.” As he does so
frequently throughout the article, Ep-
stein delivers.a version which if devel-
oped fully would throw a different light

“on the’‘matter.’ Nagel was in ‘a ‘plane

crash, but he-was given: Intelligence

training afier his recovery, indicating
that he had-no permanent brain injury.
Moreover, the fact that he stood’ trial
implies that he was legally sane. Re-
cently, he was released from Leaven-
worth Penitentiary—he had. been at
Springfield only temporari

The pul on of the Fipstein article
came at an ‘opportune time for Clay
Shaw. Obtaining advance copies, his at-
torneys entered it as evidence before a
three-judge federal panc! which was hear-
ing arguments that the DA was “con-
ducting avrein of terror™ und “perse-
cuting” the defendant. Apparently the
panel was unimpressed, for it unani-
mously rejected the defense’s argument
and ordered the case to trial.

If Garrison does get his day in court—
a day Epstein has struggled to deny him
—chances are his case will hold up better
thari, ‘The New’ Yorker's” brief for’ the
defense. —WILLIAM TURNER

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LEOB/SRS

SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case - #264170 EAIB

REF: IN Cable 25955 dtd 6 June 1968 from

OUT Cable 06625 ata 7 dune 1968 tol
19 ~ 1

Reference cables concern the claim of an individual appearing at
‘the Consul General's office in Zurich, Sqitzerlend on + June 1968 that
he is one Richard Case NAGELL. NAGELL was sentenced to.a 10 year term for.
bank robbery on 9-June 1964 and is supposedly ina federal prison in Missouri.

GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness in his investigation
according to a news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January
1968. ‘he clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached. This
file also contains a copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 pre¢pared
in research on the GARRISON CASE.

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to
ascertain from the FBI if Subject.is still in préson.

I did not receive reference IN.Cable 25955 initially. Attached is
a copy I obtained from-0S Cable Desk. However, the original copy was
routed to SRS and it is possible some one.else on the Staff is already
handling the matter.

Background

My initial contact with Mr. Nagell was when he was expelled
from the DDR by the East German officials who forcibly
propelled him toward us over the borderline into West Berlin,
As we initially escorted Mr, Nagell back to US Army Lospital
Berlin in the US Mission vehicle, he seemed unsure of where
he was, and who we were, as well as being angry and belligerent
about his treatment by the East Germans, In the course of
the two hour interview which was then conducted at the
hospital, Mr. Nagell gradually regained his composure and
gave a more cooperative and coherent history. At his
insistance, the interview took place in the presence of the

attorney Mr._Ricey S. New, Jr., who acted in an unofficial
capacity as a legally oriented "friend."

The salient aspects of Mr. Nagell's history are as follows.

He says he was on active military duty (Army) from 1948 until
1959, For the first three of. these years. he: was.an enlisted.
man, and“ for the: last six he was an officer, working in
military intelligence. In 1954*he was the sole survivor in

a plane crash which resulted in a brain concussion, numerous
‘physical injuries, and prolonged military hospitalizetion.

Nr, Nagell now claims that he believes it was this head

injury which resulted in his “unstable personality and

immature or impulsive behaviour." ie attributes to this
instability his marital difficulties and his decision tc
resign his commission in 1959, something which he now considers
unwise, At the time of his leaving the service he was not
awarded a disability pension, but he says that he was later
able to successfully petition the VA for a "b4&% disaLility."

He claims that he had never seen a psychiatrist duri his
military ‘career,

of

From 1959 to 1962 he says that he worked for the Stave
California as. an investigator for various bureaus, ii
marital difficulties had increaseu and his w
separation, keeping with her their two child.
says that. one night in 1962 he became intoxicated, | a tried
to break down the door to her apartment, On this basis he
says he lost his job and says that for the next. year ‘he
“just drifted," apparently without motivation to worl,
supporting himself on. his disability pension.and financial
aid from his-sister, le is not certain about whether or not
the divorce from his wife has ever been legally compieted,

In September 1963 he was accused of committing an act which
“he now says was bred out of his feeling of hopelessness

and desperation, Ne claims that in a confused way he

attempted while armed to rob a bank and was easily appre-

*. hended. For the next 4 1/2 years followed a complicated

series of trials, appeals and retrials, In addition to
spending these years in prison, he also-had at least three
prison hospitalizations for psychiatric observation, His
appeals apparently hinged on his contention that he was
"temporarily insane" at the time of the crime. lle was not
»-considered insane. at any time during his imprisonment, and
his claim to temporary insanity found support in the expert
testimony of a noted American neurologist, Dr. Edwin
| Weinstein, Dr. Weinstein apparently interpreted Nagell's

_EEG's Celectro-encephalograns) as being abnormal and argued

| that Nagell had developed a "paranoid personality, and

‘tion was apparently disputed by other expert witnesses, but

tinstability" on the basis of his brain injury. This ey bat

- in any case: Nagell..was' officially acquitted’om April 29 of
this year,

Nagell says he then went to the New York area, where his
sister (his closest relative) resides, but he claims an
additional complication in his life had risen in that he
had once been an "acquaintance" of Lee Harvey Oswald, and
had been implicated ina possible plot to assassinate
President Kennedy in an article in RAMPARTS magazine which

ee eieete ane in January 1968. Ir. Nagell firmly denies that he

was _involved—in_any way with any such conspiracy. and was.
in fact impri the tim ssa On

In June, shortly théreafter, he discussed with an American
consular official in Zurich his recurrent fear that the

CIA was going to "hit" him. His next travel point was to
West Berlin, and on June 11, 1968, while his train was
traversing the. DDR, he says that he was taken off the

train and illegally detained, He is not certain why he

was taken off the, train but admits to having talked freely
on the train to other passengers about his life history,

and he was also carrying with him a heavy portfolio of all
of his Army and government records involved with his service
career, disability, and imprisonment, For several mcnths
Nagell. claims that he was interrogated by the Last Germans
and repeatedly asked to confess his role as a spy or govern-
ment agent. Eventually, Nagell says that he concluded the
only way to be released would be to feign mental illness,
which he says he proceeded to do. This was several weeks
ago and he says he was soon examined by an East German
psychiatrist and events were set in motion which culminated
in. his release today,. four and: one-half. months»afterhis
detention began.

Mr, Nagell's: plans for the future center around returning,
to the United States and beginning an appeal. to the govern-
ment to grant him a psychiatric disability pension, as well

injury. He no longer believes that it is realistic to think

as for his physical disability, on the basis of his head A

Mental Status Exam

Hr. Nagell is a tall, 38 year old male who shows the evidence
of a prior head injury in the form of extensive scars on

the left side of his face, facial asymmetry due to.seventh+s——...

nerve injury, reconstructive surgery on his left ear, etc.
In addition he shows some healed incisions on his left wrist
which he claims were superficial lacerations self-inflicted
at the ‘time of his first imprisonment in 1963, and again a
few weeks ago in the DDR. He denies that in either instance
he seriously intended to kill himself, He is of superior
intelligence and shows: a remarkable memory for dates. and
names, Initially hé was belligerent, angry, and suspicious
of every effort made to help him. Over the span of two
hours, he gradually became more cooperative and rational.

overall suspiciousness, and his fears about the CIA, there
was no overt evidence of psychosis. His nutritional state
and general well-being both appeared to be good.

Summary

In summary then we seem to be dealing with a-person who has
had a personality disorder for a number of years, manifested
by emotional instability,-impulsive behaviour, a tencency ©
to be litigious, and a general suspicious or. paranoi¢
orientation, It is difficult to know how much of whet he
is saying is factual, but it may be that in June of this
- year he was becoming "borderline" or even delusional in his
thinking about possible attempts on his life, and this
probably explains his flight to Europe. Currently, he is
not psychotic and seems competent in a legal and psychiatric
sense to negotiate his own affairs and be a free citizen
again.
His own. closing: words. provide:.a lighter note to what» other~
wise has. been a complicated and serious mishap. "Well, I'll
tell you one thing, that's the last time I ever take a train
through East. Germany!"

GIST: SLOSS; a eteff employee since 1948, bas recently been
repelygraphed with inconclusive results, having reacted to questions
regarding disclosure of classified informetion, avscciation with a com-
munist sympathiger, and homosexuality. He has also been Invelved

with cooperation in an extramarital affeir which {chiminated in a black-

mail attempt on one ef the parties. His name is perhaps identical with
a name among six names of Agency employees found on a mentally dis-
turbed and disaffected former CIC intelligence officetwho alleges contact
with Russian and Guben Intelligence agents. Details of these questionable
areas in regard ta GLOSS are set forth below.. Recommend intensive and
thorough investigation of SLOSS including surveillance of activities.

DETAILS: 1, Mr. John Richard $L035, born 24 September 1919
at Cleveland, Chie, has been a btaff employes of this Agency since 1948. -
His porente are American bern. He graduated from Yale Univeralty in

Ritchie, Maryland, as an instructer, from January 1943 te July 1945.

He attended Columbia University, School of International Affaire and the

Russian Institute from 1946 to 1948,. receiving an M.A. Degree in inter-
national Affairs.

2. SLOSS {e currently a Special Intelligence Duty Officer tn
OCI, GS-14... During his assigament in Gerxnany 1953-1955 and on a TDY
to Germany in 1988,,he had been authorized to deal with foreign intelli-
gence elements in the OG] overseas Maison program, SLOSS was poly
graphed in 1950 and 1953 with favorable results; in 1953 with unfavorable
results; and twice in 1964 with inconclusive reeulte regarding giving CIA
éocuments or claegsified information to unauthorized persons, contact
with a possible communist sympathizer, and engaging in homosexual acti-
vities since working for CIA... He wee granted a "Q" Clearance im October
1963, His Top Secret Clearance was certified to the White House on 23

SLOSS found on the person of Richard Gm NAGELL when arrested in con-

nection with a bank robbery in El Paso, Texas, on 20 September 1963. A

tes, the addresses of Foreign Embagaies, the names of purported CIA

further specific questioning on 22 May 1964 cevering the various homosexual
areas however, there were no strong reactions to indicate that Subject might
be practicing deception on the specific question regarding engaging in home-
sexual activities since working for GIA,

8. In connection with the phape of questions concerning contact
with any possible communist sympathiser, the Subject reflected overall
disturbance indicating that all the questions obviously bothered him and
that deception wae being practiced within that phase. The polygraph opera-
tor ucted that there were outstanding reactions to the following ‘two questions:

20 b "Other than your comments about FIGHER, during your
undergraduate period at Yale did you have any contact
with any Communist or Communist sympathizer?

Answer: No, ®

20¢ Buring your CLA employment, have you had any contact
: with any Communist or Gommunist aympathicer?

‘Atiperex: No. ama

9 I. ie particularly noteworthy that during his examination on
22 May 1964 when asked nine questione as te whether he had been agquaint-
ed with cortain individuals, ct only reacted whan he answered "no"
te heving been acquainted with Jerry SEVERN and Dya WOLSTON. These
names had béen submitted to Subject haved upon pura conjecture that there
possibly might have been some connection with there individuals at Camp
Ritchie Military Intelligence Training Genter, Since the fact that both -
Jerry SEVERN and Iya WOLSTON have cooperated with Soviet Intelligence
should have been unknown to 51.088 aind he declared he is act acquainted
with ther; there should have been no season for him to.react te these names.
The polygraph operater states that SLOSS was not pressed further regarding
FISHER (whom he had characterized es "left of center") or his own possible
knowledge of SEVERN or WOLSTON since it was obvious that SLOSS was.
beginaing to fee] harassed on this matter and stated that he did not enjoy
being asked thase questions.

10, During SLOSS’ interview on 4 April 1964, SLOSS reflected
consistent reactinns on the questions:

"Since working for CIA,have you given CIA documents or ;
classified information to unauthorized persons?"

<3

SER

O0000-EL

"Have you ever deliberately given classified information on
documents to any unauthorised person?"

In explanation, Subject said he wae bothered by this idea, but
that he had no-knowledge of any particular situation wherein he had di~
vaiged information to anyone who wae unauthorised to receive it ex who
would have used it against the Agency's interest. On the test administered
on 22 May 196¢ to resolve any possible compromise to communist or foreign
intelligence organisations, it was determined that there were no significant
reactions to relevant questions in thie area.

i. It should be especially noted that the polygraph opezator, during
the 4 April 1964 interview, detected an odd emell on Subjest's breath and
acted biz flushed face, frequent silly grins and lethargic movements, sug-
gouting that the Subject way bave been slightly intoxicated... The operator
did not aak during this interview whether the Bubject had taken any drug
er alcohol prics to the interview but recalled dn incident wherein the Sub-
ject when arrested for drunken driving in 1963 had produced evidence that
he wae a diabetic and had taken medication prior to the incident... Conge«
quently, the second interview on 22 May 1964, Subject was questioned
regarding his physical health. He veplied that he had dtepped taking medi-
cation for diabetes ‘in November 1963.. He éxplaftiad-that he tock three or
four diuretic pile. He specifically denied that he had taken any other drug,
narcotic. or alcohol. When this question was asked during interrogation, —
he sefiected reaction indicative of deception and then admitted that a
breakfast he had taken one glass of vodka with same orange juice. He
stated that he drank vodka for breakfast sometimes whenever he was tense
or nérvous over anything.

RB ‘The polygraph operator in hie report concluded that the
“validity of fina} test charts is held in question and there is no
atrong evidence that the specific areas of concern have been _
gonclusively resolved at this time. It is recommended thata —
further atudy be conducted on this case and that information
resulting from such a study be sent to IRD fer possible reinter-
view of the Subject aad polygraph resolution".

33. SLOSS has indicated reactions indicative of deception during
the polygraph examinations. In one specific question where these re-

actions were present, he admitted to lying.. This was in the question as
to whether or not he had taken any alechol prior te the examination.

CONCLUSION:

ange “eins ea

1, SLOSS has Hed in hie most recent polygraph examination and
has evidenced indications of deception in areas concerning divulging
elassified information to unauthorised individuals, association with a

, Cramuniet sympathizer and homosexual inclinations. SLOSS’ reaction

to the names of Jetry SEVERN and ya WOLSTON has not been fully ex-
plored. The pblygraph operator has recarmmended further investigation
and & Fepolygraph because the recent teste are inconclusive.

2. SLOSS hag been involved in an immoral and illegal extra-
marital activity between a Staff employee and a former Staff employee
where one of the parties was subjected to a blackmail attempt.

3. The name J. SLOSS (possibly identical to Subject) appeared
on a list of CIA. employees found on the person of 2 eelf-designated "dis-
affected American" arrested by the FBI for bank robbery in September
1963, This individual (mentally disturbed) with previous intelligence ex-
patience bas declared that he was approached by Soviet Intelligence while
and/or after be was in Mexico City in September 1962.

4. It is suggested that the extent of the adverse security implica-
tions concerning SLOSS ie euch, that if SLOSS is ever found to be a security
ripk, the failure at this time to pursus an aggressive investigation of all
his contacts and activities te resolve dli.areas of doubt could possibly lead
te 8 conclusion that we have been remias in our duties. The undersigned
recommends the following action:

a. That physical and technical gurveiliance of at least two not rman

weeks duration be made of SLOSS to determine his contacts and
activities after working houre.

b. That current seven way National Agency Checks be made
on SLOSS.

ge That Richard B, FISHER, a iriend of SLOSS‘, characterized
by him as having been involved in radical and left of center ideas
while en undergraduate at Yale,be fully identified, his present lo-
sation be ascertained and the degree of his association with S].0SS
be determined by a personal interview with FISHER,

d. That Richard Case NAGELL be personally interviewed by
the undersigned in the hope that by a sympathetic approach he may
reveal how he came into the possession of the name J, SLOSS and
other employees of CIA.

her as Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. i
She was told that the Special Agents wished to talk to her i

and that she would cooperate in any way possible, F|

g
She advised that her brother, Richard Case i
Nagell, last resided with her in her home for a 5 or 6
week period which ended just prior. to Christmas, 1962.
While in New York, he was for the most partunnployed and
Seeking a position. She noted that he. did obtain a a

for only several days when he decided that this was not
the type of investigative work: he wanted to do, i

When questioned as to whether or not she knew
of. activity on the part of her brother which could
have of a subversive nature, she stated that she
knew of no such activity; that. she did not believe her ‘

that. if she ever became aware that he was engaging at 3
any time-in such activity she would have nothing to. do q.

: brother, She stated that she expected to hear from her
fee brother immediately after he received her letter and the
fact that she has not heard has made her uneasy. She
noted that she offered, if permitted, to visit him, and
that she hoped to ascertain as a result of this visit,
the reason he attempted to rob a bank in El Paso, Texas,
on September 20, 1963. She advised that she has had no
reason to believe that her brother is not responsible for
his actions, and she noted that in one letter he wrote

7 to her that the bank robbery attempt was a pre-meditated
bg action on his. part. She advised that. her brother has
been in a depressed state of mind ever since he had been
accused of taking a bribe and fired from his position
with the California. State Liquor Authority. She noted
that she believed, as her brother claims, that this
purported bribe was set up. to remove her brother from his
position with the California State Liquor Authority
because of his honesty and failure to handle investigations

as insturcted by superiors.

When questioned as to whether or not her brother,
Richard Case Nagell, maintaina any type of property at her
e residence; she advised that Be does maintain a military
: type. metal. foot locker, and that he has maintained it at
her residence since his discharge from the United
States Army. She noted that as this foob locker is
her brother's property, she is not‘aware of its contents,
although ‘she believes it contains mementoes of his
military service, including his'medals and a complete
uniform. She advised that she does ‘not even know whether or
not the foot locker is open or locked.

It 4s noted that during the course of the inter-
view of. Eleanore’ Gambert, her husband, LouigyGambert
was present.

On February 3, 1964, Mrs, MITSUKO NAGELL furnished
the following information to SAs JAMES H, HOOSE, JR., and JOSEPH
DOYLE POWELL at her residence -at 440 South Union Avenue,
Apartment 12, Los Angeles, California:

her any money, and did not like the children. She believes
NAGELL's mother resides in the Los Angeles area, but she

does not know the mother's address and has never met her,

She repeatedly asked NAGELL to introduce her to his mother, °.
but he always refused to do so, He

Mrs, NAGELL stated NAGELL never exhibited any
political interest, never mentioned communism or the Pair
Play for Cuba Committee," or Cuba. Once in the sumer of
1963 NAGELL was mad about. something unrecalled and jokingly
said he was thinking of going to Riissia, but Mrs. NAGELL is
certain this was said in jest.

Mrs, NAGELL is of the opinion there is something
mentally: wrong with NAGELL, He would fly into violent rages
without apparent reason, She pointed out that her television
set has a split plastic case and stated NAGELL hit the set -
with his fist once while angry and this resulted in this
damage.

Although NAGELL did not like his children, during
the marriage, he has frequently complained about not being
with them since the divorce, He sends them cards from various
places in the United States, but has never since the divorce
furnished support for the children or Mrs, NAGELL, As a con=_

~ sequence, Mrs, NAGELL “has been supporting herself and the_

children through employment as a waitress and has to board _

the children out. i sorb best ee ai

On March 6, 1964, Mrs, NAGELL stated to SA HOOSE
that she never Imew NAGELL to be involved in espionage in any~
manner. .She further commented that they were always in finan-
celal difficulty during their residence in the United States.
During the marriage NAGELL had a bank account at the Bank of
America, Wilshire and Vermont, Los Angeles, but Mrs, NAGELL -
doubts there was ever much money in the account. She said
that since the separation in April of 1962, NAGELL has sent
her a total of about $180.00,

There is no information in the files of the Los
Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with Mrs, MITSUKO NAGELL,

Mrs, FRANCES M, NAGELL,

“nee Frances Kaufman

(mother of RICHARD C. NAGELL)

On March.5, 1964, Mrs, FRANCES NAGELL furnished .
the following information to SAs JAMES H, HOOSE, JR., and
PHILIP J, REILLY at her residence at ‘856 South Catalina
Avenue, Apartment 104, Los Angeles:

Mrs, NAGELL stated that for many years and for
various reasons, none of which relate to this case, there
has been dissension in the family, However, until the time
that RICHARD NAGELL was in the airplane crash, they had gotten
along well together.,. Since the crash there has been a marked

*  ¢hange in RICHARD NAGELL, and Mrs, NAGELL is certain her son has»

some form of mental trouble,

She saw RICHARD in Chicago, Illinois, in 1954, and
She moved to Los Angeles in May of 1955. It was then seven
years before she heard directly from him or. saw him. She ran
into RICHARD by chance on the street in Los Angeles, saw that
he needed help, and thereafter tried to give him both moral and
financial assistance. :

Mrs. NAGELL gave her son $1,000.00 on one occasion
and much smaller amounts on other occasions, He never expressed
appreciation for this help, RICHARD never seemed to have enough
money, She does not know if he had a bank account or’not., °°" a

Mrs, NAGELL was trying to locate RICHARD after he i
had disappeared for several days. She knew he could often
be found at The Happy Rabbit, a beer:-joint at 2709 West Sixth
Street, Los Angeles. She went there and found RICHARD, and
he flew into an uncontrollable rage because she had gone inside
this bar, claiming it was no place for a decent woman.
Mes. NAGELL stated it was really not that bad a place. She
became definitely convinced after this incident that there
was something seriously wrong with her son, But even prior

After above mentioned incident, RICHARD again
would have nothing to do:with her. She kept track of him
through her other son, LOUIS, who is a year and a half older
than RICHARD, Mrs. NAGELL was in a way happy to have the
boys get together after years of estrangement. She
deseribed’ LOUIS as being an almost hopeless alcoholic,

She thought since both sons had serious problems, they might
be able to help each other. LOUIS has told her, however,
that he was never able to straighten out RICHARD.

She stated that RICHARD never ‘discussed communism,
never mentioned Cuba or the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee"
or gave any indication he was in any manner involved in
esplonage.

On March 9, 1964, Mrs, NAGELL informed SA HOOSE

‘that she. wanted to point out: that RICHARD had never physically

abused her, that the abuse was always vocal. She also mentioned
that she herself has been under psychiatric care for several
years, and she does not think her problem has yet been
eliminated,

following information to SAs JAMES H, HOOSE, JR., and PHILIP.
J. REILLY at his residence at’ 10130 Samoa Avenue, Tujunga,
California, telephone 353-1224:

LOUIS stated he got in trouble at age 16 and since
that time has used his mother's maiden name as his last name.
He considers himself to be the "black sheep" of the family and
has had little contact, with other family members until the last
year or two, At one time in Korea he discovered he was in the
same army outfit.as his brother, RICHARD, and looked him up,
RICHARD was an officer in intelligence while LOUIS was an
enlisted man, and RICHARD did not want to have much contact
with LOUIS. However, when their mother. told RICHARD that LOUIS

had cancer of the throat in 1962, RICHARD went to LOUIS and
offered to help him, LOUIS later discoveréd he did not have
cancer and also discovered that RICHARD was the one who needed
help, LOUIS frequently saw RICHARD in 1962 and until about
August of 1963 when RICHARD left the Los Angeles area.

LOUIS considers RICHARD to be mentally disturbed.
He recalled an afternoon when both were at The Happy Rabbit
and the newspapers carried an account of the burglary of the
local armory. © RICHARD told LOUIS he had pulled the burglary
and had some machine guns in his car parked on the street

‘ near the beer joint. LOUIS immediately said he would like

to see the machine guns and the two of them welked out to the
car... LOUIS. saw: no guns..and.upon asking, RICHARD..where they. were.
the latter replied he did not Imow what LOUIS was talking about,
RICHARD said he had no recollection of telling LOUIS anything
about guns or burglarizing any armory. In addition to this
LOUIS said that RICHARD was usually in a state of deep
depression, RICHARD complained about his wife divorcing him
and about his employment problems.

RICHARD never spoke in favor of communism but he
did say that he thought the American government should do
more for him in view of his army service, He never mentioned
Russia. When RICHARD returned from Mexico City in 1962, he
told LOUIS he had gone to Cuba from Mexico, He gave no
reason for having made this trip. LOUIS has no information
indicating RICHARD was ever involved in esplonage. He never...

heard RICHARD mention the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee."

LOUIS. does not know if RICHARD had a bank account;
he does know RICHARD usually was broke.

Insurance Company, 548 South Spring Street, Los Angeles,

He has known RICHARD NAGELL for about one year.
He met him through BILL LYNN of the California Alcoholic
Beverage Controll at The Happy Rabbit. JOHN does not know
any members of NAGELL's family nor does he know of any other
close friends of NAGELL,

NAGELL left Los Angeles the first or second week of —

: September, 1962, . Just before léaving he told JOHN he would

be traveling. and asked him to share his Post Office box so

he could.forward.on. the. government: disability ‘checks: which :

he receives monthly. He also asked JOHN to mail him an almanac
whenever it. was convenient as he liked to refer to the almanac

from time to time as a general source of information, JOHN a

‘complied with both requests. Near the end of each month JOHN

has sent. the checks to NAGELL at a Post Office box in El Paso,

“-\ fexas. He also sent him an almanac with a yellow cover as he
pecalls it, JOHN did not mark or alter this almanac in any way.

‘JOHN recently received a form letter from a hospital
in Missouri, informing him he had been named as a correspondent...
authorized to commmicate with RICHARD NAGELL, JOHN has received
no indication that NAGELL 1s in any sort of trouble, and he
wondered what was behind the hospital letter,

death,

About a month or two after NAGELL left Los Angeles

he wrote to. JOHN, probably just on one occasion, and that

concerned paying the rent on the joint postal box.

that he is depressed at the manner his ex-wife treated him
and the manner in which the local, state, and Federal governments
have treated him, JOHN definitely considers NAGELL to be mentally
disturbed.

‘Four photographs identified on the back
as follows;

In addition, the subject had in his possession at
the time of his arrest on September 20, 1963, a piece of
paper containing the listing of what appeared to be United
States Army Officers. and their serial numbers. One section.
of this paper was listed under the heading "Third Operations
Group",

known the subject personally and had served in
the subject. GLENN noted that his name appeared in one of
the above mentioned photographs of papers which were found ‘
in the possession of the subject.when arrested in El Paso
on September 20, 1963, GLENN stated that he and the subject

had been attached to an Intelligence Branch of the United

States Army in the Far East during the period of their acquaintance.

GLENN explained that the names in parenthesés in
one of the above mentioned photographs were "code names" used

5.



13-00000

EP 65-951

by members of Army Intelligence Units in Korea in order to
protect their real identities from informants.

GLENN also advised that the subject was not
stable mentally and that this instability was probably due
to damage to brain tissues suffered in an airplane crash
during the Korean War in which the subject was the only -
survivor. GLENN stated that the subject, in fact, did have

-a brilliant war record, which was the reason for his

assignment to Army Intelligence in spite of what should
have been an obvious, psychological defect.

GLENN pointed out a3 an example of the subject's
instability that the subject had turned in allegations
against an Intelligence Officer in Korea, which became the
subject of extensive investigation. GLENN added that te
subject was subsequently transferred to another Amy unit
and upon reporting to that unit, was greeted in a friendly
way by his new Commanding Officer, who told him he hoped
the subject would enjoy his new assignment and that he,

‘the Commander, would do 211 he could to make it a worthwhile

tour of duty for the subject.

To this, NAGELL allegedly replied that the Comnander’~

had certainly better sce that this was the case as, NAGELL
told him, he made a practice of keeping a record of every.
move ‘made by his Conmanding Officer and if he stepped out
of Line ‘onei whit at any time, it would be made the subject
of an immediate report to higher headquarters.

: GLENN made aval. lable. a letter from the Assistant
Chief of Staff, G-2/G-3, United States Army, Japan, which
was in answer to a request for information regarding the:
subject and which contained the following infomation:

SUBJECT, after graduation from the Army Intelligence
School, Fort Holabird, Maryland, in August 1955, served as an
advisor to the First Republic of Korea Army and subsequently
in Sendai, and Tokyo, Japan, terminating in about 1958.
These assignments were concerned with intelligence activities,



13-00000

EP 65-951

as an advisor to the ROK Ary ia Korea, and as a member of the

‘ US Army Counterintelligence Corps in Japan. During the

latter tour of duty, the countexrintelligence unit was designated
the 3rd Operations Group, with Headquarters in Tokyo and
Detachment B in Sendai, as referred to in photographic inclosures
to your letter.

In assignments of this nature it is common practice
for members to become acquainted with personnel of various
Japanese security agencies, such as are mentioned in March
5 Memorandum of the FBI, El Paso, Tezas, It is not unusual
for individuals assigned counterintelligence duties to retain
lists of these persons for reference in the event they are
again reassigned to the area, or for dispatching cards or
thank you notes from the United States. This would appear
to be the reason for SUBJECT having kept the list of agency
personnel, although to have retaiaed the list for a number of
years after leaving the service appears unusual. The names Kaji,
Wataru and Jack Cannon were known to the public as the results
of allegations of illegal intelligence operations that were
publicized in the Japanese press,: but SUBJECT'S reason for
including those names in HIS lists cannot be assessed. Also,
no reason can be given for the two or three miscellaneous eee
names in NAGELL'S file.

The list of Americans mentioned in one of the photographic
attachments pertains to US personnel in the intelligence field.
It appears that the subject maintained a roster of those persoas
with whom he would or had coatact, which is not unusual.
Information contained on those rosters, particularly that
portion indicating code names, was and is regardéd as classified
information by this office.

Files, of the Counterintelligence Repository, USARJ,
disclosed no information relatiye to NAGELL or of his aliases.

States District Court, denied the motion for a new trial
and. sentenced the subject to serve ten years. under the
provisions of Section 4208 (a) (II), Title 18, United States
Code, which provides that the subject can be released under
parole at any time it is deemed advisable. This sentence
was for violation of Section 2113, Title 18, United States
Code.

: The June 17, 1964 issue of “The El Paso Herald
Post", contained an article entitled “Inmate ‘Serious': After
Suicide Try", According te the article, the subject swallowed
several sleeping pills while lodged at the El Paso County Jail
on June 17, 1964... According to the article, NAGELL was to

be kept under observation all night and was to be transferred
to the William Beaumont General Hospital from the La Tuna

- Federal Correctional Institution Hospital unless his condition

improved.

The article furthe stated that Deputy U.S. Marshal
‘JACK GRAVES said seconal pills had been prescribed for tte.
subject and that. the subject evidently had been hoarding them.

“Richard Pactesu, Lynn, Mass." is undoubtedly identical to

Richard Gearge Fecteau whois in prison in Communist China.
Fetteau was taken prisoner by the Communists @uring en Agency

“operation in Nowunber 1952.

"Mr. BF. Parker may be identical to John Floyd Parker, cur<

rent Agency employee, who was born 2 January 1898, Louisville,
Kentucky.

“Migs Guthries" may be identical to Frances Agnes Guthrie,
born. 29 February 1908, Charlowton, West Virginia, who is ‘also cu eure:
rently employed by this Agency,

"Mr, C. Churchill" way be identical to Creighton Churchill
who was born J October 1918, Cornieh, New Hampshire, whose pree+-
ent address 16 not known and whose address in 1952 was 27 Weat 44th
Strect, New York City.

John Floyd Parker and Frances Guthrie have been interviewed
in regard to any knowledge ef Nagel! but neither individual has any
recollection of having evar met Richard Case Nagel. Guthrie was em-
ployed by this Agency in Japan in the 1950's... Creighton Churchill and
John Floyd Parker ware in Japan in 1952 to interview and debrief
United States servicemen who'had been held Lares ‘of war by the
Gormmanists,

In view of the background of Nagell in the Far Euet; the poesi-
bility exists that Nagel could have obtained the names of Parker,
Guthrie and Churchill in the approximate 1952 period, although a spéci-
fic statement concerning this cannot be made in view of the’ limited in-
formation concerning Nagel. -

“Myr. E.. Lelbaches"' and'My,. Da Vanon” are believed to refer to
Etnst Leibacker and Joseph Frances Davanon 6f the Los Angeles Field
Office'af this Agency... Your Loa Angeles Field Office haa been previ-
ously aware that Lefbacker and Davanon heve no personal knowledge of
Nagell.. There ig no record of any past interest in Nagel py this

recollection of having met any individual by that name. if John
Richard Sloss ia identical ta “J. Sloss," it ig not possible from
available information to even speculate as to how the name came
inte the possession of Nagel.

In view of the fact that Richard George Fecteau ie currently
in prison in China and the indication that the other six names-listed
above may refer te Agency employees, it is requested that the”
above information not be disseminated cutdide your Bureau. it
does act appear that the above information could affect either the
prosecution of or the defense of Nagell on the charge of bank rob-

: bery, and disclogure of the above information could create a later

cover problem for this Agency, ee well aa directing additienal at<
tention to the position of Fecteau.

It would be appreciated if your Bureau would edvige this

Agency of any information brought to your attention concerning how

the above names came into the possession of Nagell.

Dear Floyd:

It was good to hear from you, to learn
you are still at the old shop; etc.

I got your letter yesterday-in New York,
and while driving the 300-odd miles hoped that my
subconscious. would perhaps come out with a peal of
a bell regarding an individual named Ed Nagell. But
no bellsrang.

I have only a.small- hunch -~'a piccolo-toot
in my memory. Whe. I worked for the shop I once went
to see Mr. James Bennett, Director of Federal Prisons,
( with whom I had once shared a table on an ocean
liner, years before). You can guess why I wanted to
sec Bennett: I was seeking ways for birds to fly out
of cages. Bennett mentioned a guy ( with a questionable
record, as far as he was concerned) who claimed to
know us, you and me, what we were doing., etc. etc.

He had aproached Bennett " as from us". Ed Nagell

-- the name -- rings a piccolo-toot on this, but~only
that. Incidentally, I filed a report on the incident
when I got back to the shop.

I am often in New York ~~ at the Harvard
Club -- and should you ever be in town, give me a ring.
It would. be fun to see you. I met Harry Gsterweis in
a restaurant the other day -- fater some many, many
years. You.may remember him.

I have recently become an author an Wines.
After a year in France in 1959, I wrote a book on French
wines which was. published by Knopf, and am about to bring
out one on wines of the world with MacMillan in September.
That is about the extent of ‘my news.

Tai

My best to you.

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told
U.S, District Court that he did not attempt to hold up
the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELL
told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank,
I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time."

Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed
acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD
on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledgé of NAGELL.

NAGELL furnished a signed statement: :

".,,. In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a
representative of a foreign government preposed to me
that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal
offense and inimical to the best interest of the United
States. At that time, I refused such proposal, In May
1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-
ment made the same proposal tome. At that time, I
agreed to such a proposal."

"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,
known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government,
that arrangements for my. participation in the aforementioned
act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid
proposal,

Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this
same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be
disclosed to thé Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-
upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,
although I did not intend todo so. This existing situation
actuated my conduct of September20, 1963, for which 1
was arrested and am presently charged.

I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that
my arrest.would provide an immediate, though temporary,
solution to the problem with which I was confronted.

bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the

purpose of psychiatric examination,

3. ‘The name of Jahn SLOSS may be identical with tha name J.
SLOSS found on the person of Richard Gasz NAGELL when arrested in con-
nection with a bank robbery in El Paso, Texas, on 20 September 1903. A
notebook found on NAGELL made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Commit<
tee, the addresses of Foreign Embassies, the names of purported CIA
agents and other information. Although NAGELL is unquestionably ment-
ally unbalanced, he tells a story of being involved in eaplonage which is
not fully contradicted by evidence. There is no apparent explanation of
why the name J. SLOSS aa well aa five other names of CIA personnel
should have been in the possession of Richard Case NAGELL. The weird
story of NAGELL is contained in a chronclogical listing of his activities
appended to this memorandum, :
