Information attached to this report fell into

• the hands of JMWAVE through two distinct channels.

Sometime

prior to 7 July 1962 AJCOG-2 through a cut-out had delivered

to AMBLEAK-? some material. AVCOG-2 does not know ANBLEAK-?.

AMBLEAK-2 brought it out to AMBLEAK-1 who on 7 July 1962

turned the "pouch" over to ILAWLOTT, AMBLEAK-1'S C/O.

intercepted this "pouch" and xeroxed the cover pages of the

reports which were gonerated by ALIMPEX; the material was

and they in turn delivered the matertal to NOEMAIR(P)

the ASPELL C/O, on or about 19 July.

This is the background to a story which now gains new

importance.

The information which was copted by HAWLOTT is

not reflected in toto in the materiel eventually received

by NOENAYR, thus the xeroxed coples of some of the documents,

original copies for which were not received from the AUSPELL

organization.

REPORT COVER SHEET (continued)

Operational security precludes a confrontation of the AMSPELL

organization,

therefore Headquarters will have to be satisfied

with copies of the original documents for some of the import/

export items, and with xeroxed copies of merely the cover sheets

for some of the other items idi

This whole sad story has had one positive reaction.
