1. In an article by Pedro Lats DIAZ Lanz, former Chief, Cuban Air Force,
which appeared in PARADE of the Kas! on Post on 3 January 1960 entitled
“Why I Fight Fidel *caStao* (201-97356), the following statenent is made:

"My doubts grew vben I accompanied him on his official visit
to Venezuela. He put on a big act of not vanting to neet Venezuela's
top Communist, Gustavo HACHADO. Yet be locked himself in a bathroom
witb MACHADO for two hours. It vas the longest talk be beld with .
anyone in Venezuela.”

2. Ges“ avo MACHADO bas for some years been well-known as on overt top
Communist leader in Venezuela, bat the meeting with CASTRO, if it did in fact
occur, as presucably it éié, could have much more significence in light of
the following information previously received from a source proven to be
Feliable in the past and knovm to have been in a position to have knowledge
of RIS activities during World War II.

"Gustavo MACHADO Morales, born 1898 in Caracas, Yenerucla, vas
recruited in the sumer of 1944 by the KKGB in Bogota, Coloubia, for
political intelligence work ia his native Venezuela. MACHADO was
initisiiy controlled vy RIS through his vife, Maria Lucas MACHADO,
vho maintained contact with Soviet Consular officials during the
middle forties."

Is view of the above, it 1s requested that KARNIAY interview Pedro H
Z ierz in the most minute detail concerning bis mowledge of errange- -
rents made for this contact with MACHADO in Venezuela, the reactions of CASTRO |
to the arrangenents, and any indicated reactions in the days following that H
meeting. The interview should incinde specifica aa to the location, identities i
of others who vere Knowledgeable of the contact, the length of the meeting, .
and other circumstances surrounding it.

Although our efforts at this tine and in this connection any not in
any way establish that CASTRO 4s a Soviet agent, it is believed that as
wach detail as possible should be acquired concerning this meeting, since
it may be of considerable value at soos future tine.

But Lam rashing abead of my story. Let me go back
0 carly 1952, when Dr. Carlos Prio was President of
Cabs. Accidentally I tearned that his rival, Falgencio
Batista, planned to take over the xovernment. { paned
‘00 this information through my father, « career gor-
erament employe. And on March 18, 1952, a8 T had
warned, Hatista reized the presidency.

+ When, later, I met Prio, he seemed genuinely pent
teat about the corruption in his adzunistration and
sore he would win back frecdom for the Cuban
people. He was so fervent that I left the interview a
revolutionary dedicated to the same cause of liberty.

In those davs it was common for airline pilots to
smuggle nylons and Scotch imto Cuba—sonething I
never did. Now, however, I started bringing ta rifles.
‘After a year, someone whispered to Batista’s secret
police. Thes tortured and humiliated my father. Then
they seized me for 10 days of crose-examination.

leaped aboard the plane as it wa/taziing, and left my
homeland behind.

Now a revolutionary, I went from Port au Prince
to Miami. For the next two vears, { worked as basbov

To give the trip the appearance of an outing, we
brought along a couple in the back seat. Batista patcols,
stopped us 15 times and frisked us for weapons. But
they politely left the mul alone; they never suspected
that this giggling teenager carried a pistol strapped
under her shirt.

At Camaguey, Frank sod I made our ways separately

Because Castro had denounced me

Aperican who had been with me

civilian plane. The gun openings had
been permanently sealed and the bomb

My Message for Castro

After we were safely on our way back
to Florida, Castro's soldiers shot one of
their own B-26s full of holes. A light
pline also was fired upon and its
Ghilean pilot wounded. Throughout
Havana the falling ‘shrapnel caused
tragic casualties for which Castro chose
to blame me rather than his own men.
