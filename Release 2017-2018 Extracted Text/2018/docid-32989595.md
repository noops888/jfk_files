The FBI did not open a kidnapping case on the

John Paisley matter, although the FBI considered his

disappearance as a possible violation of the Federal

Kidnapping Statute,

Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1201(b).

Information was received on a possible violation on

September 29, 1978, From Walter Taylor, National Editor

of "The flashington Star," who advised that shortly after

5:00 a.l. Assistant Editor Kenneth Elchenberry (phonetic)

received a telephone call fron an individual who identified

hirself as Chawzi Ullah, stating that they had licnapped a

Central Intelligence Agency (fIA) employee named John

Taysle (phonetic).

Mr. Taylor

that John Paisley, a CIA agent, had been seized by one of

their commandos in the Chesapeake Bay area.

He stated that

Chawzi Ullah made the following

demands for the

"Tiuslin Council of War of New York'": (U)

1.

the release of all Muslim prisoners;

2. $1,000,000.00 and;

3. that kenry Kissinger be turned over to then. (U)

He stated that the specific tine and date would

be called in later and that he wanted this action to be

published and widely circulated.

He further stated that

this was no joke; that it was not a game; and that it

affected the fate of "Islan." (U)

It should be noted that "The Washington Post"

on Friday, September 29, 1978, Page El, contained an

article corceming Paisley and his disappearance and that

he was lost off his sloop somewhere in the Chesapeake

Bay. (U)

Paisley's body was located in the Chesapeake Day

on October 1, 1978. In view of the evidence not supporting

an actual kidnapping nos the crossing of a state line, the

FBI conducted no further investigation into this violation

of the Federal Kiinapping Statute. (U)

Purpose of this memorandum is to revise policy for the consolidation and

purging of the civil fingerprint file.

BACKGROUND:

The civil fingerprint file is housed on the third floor of the identi-

fication Guilding and consists of more than 136, 00), 000 fingeryrint cards occupying

approximately T, 000 square feei of floor space. The file is broken cown into 5

principal sections, Military (43, 000, 000), Civil Service (19, 000, 000), Alien (14, 000, 0

National Defense and Miscellaneous Applicants (54, 000, 000), and Personal Identifica-

top (0, 000, 00U). As personnel have been available in the past we have, on a limited

basis, consolidated and purge the file. For example, we have been microfilming ani

destroying prints in the National Army Section of the Military file (Worid War Che

prints not filed by classification), which contains 4, 250, 000 prints. This project is

about 66% complete. Further, the Prisoner of War file, which contained appromimais

358, 735 prints, was recently destroyed with Archival approval. We have ulso been

purging the National Defense section of the file of persons 75 years of age and older.

This purge was conducted with approval of the Director and approximately 5, 413, 850

of these prints have been tabbed for destruction. As a regiar procedure we have ion.

microfilmed and destroyed deceased prints (both civil and criminal) after 10 years

from date of death.

PROPOSALS: The Bureau's budge requesi for fiscal year 1972 contains 274 em-

ployees earmarked for consolidation of the civil file and, if this request is approved,

we intend to proceed with the following policy for implementation of this project:

1. The National Deiense portion of the file contains the fingerprints oi

individuals ta'sen in connection with civilian national defense work during World War

Two and comprises almost one-third of our entize civil file (45 million). In 1957 the

Bireau, in order to retard the growth of the civil file, established a policy of not re-

taining new prints submitted in this category, i. e., non-Federal applicants.

Thus,

no additional prints have been added to ine file since 1957. We propose to destroy thi

ale as well as the index cards applicable to it.. The prints were submitted initially

to determine whether or not the inde unls had arrest records in order that they

might ba considered for cmploym a connection with the national defense during

Identification Division

additional purpose that would be served by retaining these prints would be to

establish identity in unknown accensed, amnesia victim or missing person cases.

Esperience has shown that activity in this file is practically nonexistent. Authoriti

' to proceed with this proposal rests with the Buzcau.

2. We propose to destroy the fingerprint cards of all individuals in the

remaining sections of the civil file who are 75 years of age and older. Activity in

this section of the civil fiie is practically nil. In order to proceed with this propos

we would need the concurrence of the agencies involved, such as immigration and

Naturalization Service (INS) for alien prints, Civil Service Commission (CSC) for

Civil Service prints, and branches of the military for military prints. We would

also need Archival approval.

3.. We propose that the remaining fingerprints in the civil file be consol

idated and in those instances where more than one fingerprint card is found on the

same individual that only one card be retained and the remaining cards destroyed..

A record of the prints destroyed would be retainca in our Card index Section for

future reference. The consolidated index card would show dates taken and sources

of duplicate prints destroyed. If this procedure is adopted, we will have on file at

least one fingerprint card for each individual represented in our civil file. In orde:

to proceed with this proposal we will need concurrence from the agencies involved,

including INS, CSC, and the branches of the military as well as Archival appioval.

If these proposals are adopted and personnel provided to carry them out,

upon compietion of the consolidation and purging project we would destroy at least

67, 000, 000 civil fingerprint cards which would result in the savings of more

than

23, 500 square feet of floor space or approximately 50% of the civil file and space

it now occupies.

We estimate completion of the project in 10 years, or an average

saving of 2350 square feet of floor space par year. In addition to the savings in floo

space, benefits would be realized from savings in searching and locate time. The

274 employees requested in the fiscal year 1972 budget earmarked for the civil file

consolidation project do not involve the criminal file. However, we are also con-

sidering proposed policy for limited purging of the criminal file and a separaie

memorandum will be submitted forward on this.

RECOMMENDATIO!: That our proposed procedures for consolidation and purging

of the civil iiics be approved and we be authorized to proceed to contact the other

agencies to obtain their concurrence.

We are considering the folliwing two proposals designed

to enhance the searching etticiency of the civil fingerprint file now con-

taining more than 137, 000, C00 fingerprint cards and to roase available

badly needed space for expansion purposes. It should be noted that

fingerprints submitted by your agency that are ideatified with arrost

records in our tiles are not involved in these proposals.

(1) Purge and destroy the fingerprints of individuels 75

years ef age and older from this file.

(2) In instances where this file contains more than cra

set of fingerprinto ci indivicuals less than 75 joars of age, that cos set

be retairsd and ali cuplicates costroyed. We would retain a record cf

the duplicates destroyed by means cê entries on cur index carde.

SUBJECT:

CONSOLIDATION AND PURGE

CIVIL FINGERPRINT FILE

IDENTIFICATION DIVISION

=..4.=

On 1-13-71 the Executives Conference consisting of Messrs. Tolson,

Mohr, Sullivan, Bishop, Brennan, Adams for Callahan, Casper, Conrad. Felt, Gale:

Rosèn, Tavel, McDaniel for Walters, and Soyars considered the following matter.

BACKGROUND:

The civil fingeryrint file is housed on the third floor of the Identi-

fication Building and consists of more than 136, 000, 000 fingerprint cards occuying

approximately 47, 000 square feet of floor space. The file is broken down into

principal sections, Military (43, 000, 000), Civil Service (19, 000, 000); Alien (14, COD. Cl

National Defense and Miscellaneous Applicants (54, 000, 000), and Personal Identifica-

tion (6, 000, 000). As personnel have been available in the past we have, on a limited

basis, consolidated and purged the file. For example, we have been microfilming ana

destroying prints in the National Army Section of the Military file (World War One

prints not filed by classification), which contains 4, 250,000 prints. This project is

about 65% complete. Further, the Prisoner of War file, which contained approximatel:

358, 735 prints; was recently destroyed with Archival approval. With the Director's

approval, we have been purging the ivational Defense section of the file of persons T3

years of age and older,

and approximately 5, 413, 890 of these prints have been tabbed

for destruction. As a regular procedure we have long microfilmed and destroyed de-

ceased prints (both civil and criminal) aiter 10 years from date of death.

PROPOSALS: The Bureau's budget request for fiscal year 1972 contains 274 ein-

ployees earmarised for consolidation of the civil'file and, if this request is approred,

we intend to proceed with the following policy for implementation of this project:

1. The National Defense portion of the file contains fingerprints of indi-

viduals taken in connection with civilian national defense work during World War Tro

and comprises almost one-third of our entire civil file (45 million).

In 1957 the Burea

to retard the growth of the civil file, established a policy of not retaining new prints

submitted in this category, i.e., non-federal applicants. Thus, no additional veiris

have been added to the file since 1957. We propose to destroy this file and the index

is applicable to it

The prints were submitted initially to determine whether or:

e individuals had arrest records in order that they might be considered for national

defense employment. This purpose has been served. The only additional purpose ira:

would be served by retaining these prints would be to establish identity in uninown

deceased, amnesia victim or missing person cases. Activity in this file is practicalli

nonexistent. Authority to proceed with this proposal rests with the Bweau.

The Cor-

ference unanimously agreed to this proposal.

2. We propose to destroy the fingerprint cards of all individuals in the

remaining sections of the civil file who are 75 years of age and older. Activity in this

section of the civil file is practically nil. In order to proceed with this proposal we

would need the concurrence of the agencies involved, such as Immigration ard Natural

zation Service (INS) for alien prints, Civil Service Commission (CSC) for Civil Serrice

prints, and branches of the military for military prints. We would also need Archiral

approval. The majority of the Conference, consisting of Messis. Tolson, Rosen, Gai

Brennan, Sullivan, Soyars, Tavel and McDaniel, agreed with this proposal. The mi-

nority, consisting of Messrs. Mohr, Adams, Bishop, Casper, Felt and Conrad, were

I of the opinion that the age limit should be 80 rather than 75.

3. We propose that the remaining fingerprints in the civil file be consol-

of the prints destroyed would be retained in our Card Index Sectiön for future referenc

The consolidated index card would show dates taken and sources of duplicate prinis

destroyed. It this procedure is adopted, we will have on file at least one lingerprint

card for each individual represented in our civil file. In order to proceed with this

proposal we will need concurrence from the agencies involved, including Inis, CSC:

the branches of the military as well as Archival approval. Conference unanimously

(agreed with this proposal.

It these proposals are adopted and personnel provided to carry them oué.

upon completion of the project we would destroy at least 67, 000, 000 civil fingerprini

cards which would result in the savings of more than 23, 500 square feet of iloor space

or approximately 50% of the civil file and space it now occupies. We estimate compio

tion of the project in 10 years, or an average saving of 2, 350 square feet of floor spec

per year. In addition to the savings in floor space, benefits would be realized from

savings in search and locate time. If the proposals are approved, the Identification

•Division will proceed to contact the other agencies to obtain their concurrence.

Respectfully,

For the Conference

Dear Judaster:

In connection with our continuing inquiry into the

John Paisley matter, there is some additional information

which I would appreciate your making available to us.

1. In view of the questions which have been raised by

Mrs. Paisley concerning the identification of her husband's

body, we would like to have copies of all the fingerprint

cards and fingerprint registration cards

which were located,

examined and/or prepared in connection with the Bureau's

recent Paisley fingerprint identification work, including,

of course, the final report which was prepared

on this

subject for the Maryland State Police.

In addition,

would be helpful for us to have copies of all the relevant

materials relating to any FBI policies or practices which

may have accounted for the purging from FBI files of the

John Paisley prints which had been submitted at the time

of Mr. Paisley's application for employment by the CIA.

We have been informed by officials of the CIA that

on September 29, 1978, they were informed that "the FBI

opened a kidnapping case" in connection with this matter.

If this information is accurate, I would appreciate your

providing us with copies of any

materials which reflect the

predicate and authorization for initiating that inquiry,

together with whatever information was developed as a result.

3.

We have also been informed by the CIA that on

September 28, 1978, the Agency informed the Bureau by

memorandum that a Coast Guard official had advised

CIA that

To aid the Committee in this study,

it would be beneficial if designated Committee staff were

provided with the following:

(1) A visit to the FBI's Chicago field office in

order to interview those Special Agents responsible for

the peaceful resolution of the recent attempted take-

over of the German consulate by Croatian terrorists.

dent is illustrative of the coordination the FBI has with;

both the State Department and local law enforcement

for a terrorist kidnapping in the United States comparable

to that which occurred in the Moro case in Italy.

Thomas Crowley and Keith Raffel, who hold full sensi-

The following investigation was conducted at

San Jose, California, by SA JOHN W. ZENT, JR.: U

An Offense Report was made available by the

San Jose State University (SJSU) Police Department

concerning a demonstration that took place at SJSU on

March 16, 1976, wherein the ISA, San Jose, California,

disrupted a public forum presented by the Committee for

Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran (CAIFI).- A

leaflet published under the letterhead of the ISA,

Northern California, entitled "Who is REZA BARAHENI?, a

Traitor", was also furnished. The public forum had

scheduled prominent speakers, including DANIEL ELLSBERG,

JESSICA MITFORD, KAY BOYLE and DI. REZA BARAHENI.

protested the presence of REZA BARAHENI, who claims to be

an Iranian National and a former political prisoner in

Iran.

The ISA claimed BARAHENI is actually an Agent of

SAVAK, the Iranian Secret Police. L

The report indicates that some 200 to 250 Iranian

students disrupted the public forum with chanting and

shouting, as well as destruction of CAIFI literature.

The

SJSU Police Department advised the representatives of CAIFI

and BARAHENI beforehand that they had received an indication

of this planned demonstration and advised BARAHENI that

some threats against his personal safety had been rumored.

Based upon this, BARAHENI declined to appear at the forum,

but the ISA demonstrators remained and shouted over the

voices of the other speakers who gave their addresses as

scheduled.

The basis of the Police Department's concern

was previous ISA demonstrations at various locations

throughout the United States where BARAHENI has spoken in

Other demonstrations and disruptions occurred on

January 9, 1975, at the University of California at Berkeley

(UCB), at Boston, Massachusetts, on February 27, 1975, and at

Austin, Texas, on February 5, 1976.U

prevent any hostilities at the forum, made' an effort to

The following investigation was conducted at

Berkeley, California, by SA V. STEWART DALEY: iL

A search of the records of the Berkeley Police

Department on April 13, 1977, located a öffense report

dated 11/12/75, which reported the theft of a license plate

from the automobile of DARIA B. BAKHTIARIHA, which revealed

him to be a student at Armstrong College, Berkeley, California,

who is a cltizen of Iran, born July 5, 1950, who resides at

-290 Apartment 39, Hopkins Street, Berkeley, California. L

It was determined from Armstrong College, Berkeley,

California, on April 13, 1977, that DARIA B. BAKHTIARIHA was

an Undergraduate Student at that institution, studying

Accounting and Business Administration from January, 1972, until

February, 1976, when he failed to attend further classes. L

On April 14, 1977, a copy of a California driver's

license in the name Of DARIA BAKHTIAR BAKHTIARIHA, with the

address of 2535 College Avenue, #309, Berkeley, California.

On April 14, 1977, it was determined from the

Berkeley, California, that DARIA BAKHTIARIHA had been a

tenant at that location up until early 1976, when he was killed

in Oakland, California, during the commission of a robbery or

burglary. u

On April 18, 1977, the records of the Oakland Police

Department were reviewed regarding the death of DARIA

At 4:25 a.m. on February 20, 1976, DARIA BAKHTIARIHA

was exiting his automobile in the 6300 block of Racine Street,

Oakland, California. Moments before, two. unknown Subjects

forced their entry into the bathroom window of a groundfloor

apartment at 540 Älcatraz Street, Oakland, 'California, which

is around the corner from the location of

BAKHTIARIHA's car,

and a total of two blocks away.

Upon gaining entry to the

apartment, the responsibles bound the neck, hands and feet of

the occupant of the apartment, PETER LEE KENFIELD, and tied a

pillowcase over his head. The result was that KENFIELD died

The responsibles ransacked his apartment,

and as was later determined from friends of KENFIELD's, removed

•22 caliber pistol from KENFIELD's balongings.

The two reponsibles then moved to the apartment next door,

where they attempted to force entry, but were denied at the

front door by the occupant, RAYMOND STEWARI, whom they wounded

in the leg by firing four bullets through the front door with

KENFIELD'S pistol.

The two then exited the apartment building,

and en route to their residence, approximately three blocks away,

came directly in contact with BAKHTIARIHA, who was exiting his

car at that time.

They approached BAKHTIARIHA, robbed him at

gunpoint, and

shot him

in the stomach and back.

then staggered to the intersection of. Racine and Alcatraz Street,

where he collapsed on the sidewalk. A resident, who was first

on the scene, was told by BAKHTIARIHA that he had been robbed

and shot by two Negro males. BAKHTIARIHA died at a nearby

hospital shortly after his arrival.u

A crime-scene search located a thumbprint on the

bathroom window

at the point of entry. Subseguent investigation

determined the identity of the missing calculator and pistol and

dissemination of this

information to the patrol officers and

burglary unit resulted in the matching of KENFIELD's calculator

to a calculator recovered in connection with an investigation of

a burglary on February 24, 1976, at 685 63rd Street, Oakland,

California, which is two blocks

away from the site of KENFIELD's

and BAKHTIARIHA's murder.

Arrested for this burglary was JOHN.

M. HARTWAY, JR., Negro male, born January 21r. 1954, and an

accomplice. HARTWAY's fingerprints matched with the print

recovered at KENFIELD's apartment.

A trace of the recovered

calculator found in HARTWAY's possession from its time of

manufacture, verified that it was purchased by KENFIELD. Their

bullets recovered from BAKHTIARIHA's body were found to be

identical to the bullets fired through the door of STEWART'S

apartment. The revolver was never recovered.

JOHN HARTWAY was convicted by a jury in the superior

Court of the State of California, the County of Alameda, on

August 16, 1976, for one count of

• Murder in the First Degree,

two counts of Burglary in the First Degree, one count of

Robbery in the First Degree, and one count of Assault with a

Deadly Weapon in the first degree. A prior conviction was

dismissed and a motion for a new trial was denied, as was a

motion for probation.

HARTWAY was sentenced on September 14,

1976, to serve consecutive sentences for his convictions on

burglary, robbery and assault, with those sentences to run

concurrently with the sentence imposed for murder. He was

delivered to the custody of the Sheriff of Alameda County

for transmittal to the California Medical Facility, Vacaville,

California,

from where he will be further transported to a

state prison. U

It was determined from Sergeant LEW MACE: Oakland

Police Department, the investigating officer, that it was the

decision of the prosecuting attorney not to prosecute HARTWAY.

for the robbery and murder of BAKHTIARIHA because of his

confidence that their case against HARTWAY for the murder of

KENFIELD WAS

sufficient for conviction, and because without

the gun used to kill BAKHTIARIHA, their case against HARTWAY

for that murder was circumstantial, although strongly soul

operations are profitable and that RAFIZADEH probably took

GROWLER's advica concerning the size of the dairy operation

HERMAN H. FELLER, 3111 Brighton First Place,

Brooklyn, New York

(NY) furnished the following information:

He is the President of Feller Chemical Corporation,

Rodex International, Lta., Shock-M-All Incorporated

and Ultrason International. All of these firms are

located in a one-room office on the ground floor in

a resident apartment complex at 220 West Merrick Road,

Valley Stream, NY (telephone number (516) 825-2424) •

He also maintains post office box 272, Valley Stream,

in the name of Shock-M-All Incorporated.

Feller Chemical Company which dealt primarily

in insecticides is a dormant organization, because

MI. FELLER is devoting his full time to marketing a

device which is attached to the baseboard of a room

and electricutes cockroachs and other crawling insects

which crawl into the devicé..

Mr. FELLER demonstrates

this device by attaching it

to the inside of a display

bOX.

Into the box, Mr. FELLER places live roaches

which he breeds in his office for this purpose.

Mì. FELLER has patented this device and is

attempting to develop distributors for it, but to gate,

has

been unable to establish any distributorships.

He is also negotiating with various people to have

the device manufactured.

Ultrason International was displaced by Rodex

International, Ltd., which markets an ultrasonic rodent

repeller.

FELLER explained that this machine

chases rats and other rodents by use of an ultrasonic

sound. The rodents attempt to find a new area to colonize,.

which area is usually inhabited by other rodents.

The ensuing fight between these two groups of rodents

usually results in the rodents killing off each

other to the extent of about 80 percent.

MI. FELLER explained that he is freguently

alone in his office as his only employee, who

does clerical work and works only part time, usually works

three days a

week.

On one such occasion, at approximately 1:45

in the afternoon about two weeks ago, two men entered

the office and announced they were there to ask some

questions.

MI. FELLER asked them to identify themselves.

They ignored this request and stated that they had

some questions concerning NASSAR APSEAR,. an Iranian

residing in the Washington, D.C. area, who was an acquaintance

Of FELLER'S.

MI. FELLER told these men that if they wanted

information concerning AFSHAR, they should ask AFSEAR.

MI. FELLER described one

of these men (referred

to as unman $1) as about 5 feet 6 inches tall, 150

pounds, stocky, muscular build. The other man (referred

to as unman $2), is 5 feet 10 inches tall, 150 pounds,

siender build., They both appeared to be in their 40's.

Although they did not resemble AFSHAR, they did possess

some of the same general characteristics and therefore,

MI. FELLER assumed they were Iranians. AFSHAR is the

only other Iranian Mr.

FELLER ever met.

Unman #2 seemed to be in charge.

When Mr. FELLER declined to answer their

questions,

they then assumed a threatening attitude.

Ät this point, Mr. FELLER explained to the men that

his office was equipped with a burglar alarm system which

was connected with the Valley Stream Police Department

and the police would respond immediately to the alarm

and probably shoot the two men if they caused

any trouble. MI. FELLER also stated that he could

use his telephone to comnunicate directly with Nassau

County Police Department cars, which might be in the

area.

• Unman #1 had some kind of a "tool with three

ping" in his hand with which he hit Mr. FELLER on the

right shoulder, breaking his skin in three places.

Mr. FELLER, in turn, picked-up a Shock--All transformer

one and three-fourths pounds), and hit unman #1 on

the forehead, causing profuse bleeding. MI. FELLER

told the men

to get out of his office or he would call

the police.

At this point, unman 12 assumed a more peaceful

attitude and trled to quiet Mi. fELLER and unman $1.

He asked permission to make a collect telephone call

which Mr. FELIER agreed to. He spoke in a foreign

language to an individual unknown to MI. FELLER fOI.

a few seconds and then handed the telephone to Mr.

FELLER.

The man at the other end of the line,. who

spoke excellent English, did noe give his name, but

told MI. FELLER that he was from the Iranian Embassy.

He apologetically explained that a mistake had been

made and the two men had no right to be there.

. He

asked Mr. FELLER to please excuse their actions to

which Mr. FELLER replied that he would press charges

against them.

he gave the telephone back to unman 2.

After saying

a few words, he hung up and told Mr. FELLER

that they would leave immediately and offered to pay

cash for any damages they may have caused. Mr. FELLER

told them to get out of his office.

Mr. FELLER did not push the alarm button

nor did he communicate with any police agency in any

way.

Mr. FELLER explained that he first met NASSAR

AFSHAR in 1955 or 1956, when he (ASHAR) was in the

import-export business with an office in the Empire

State Building, New York City. MI. FELLER was instrumental

in arranging for AFSHAR to meet certain people and

to arrange for a contract between these people and

the .

government of Iran in some sort of deal pertaining

to the exporting of over 40,000,000 barrels of oil

over a three year period.

AFSEAR received a commission

on this contract.

MI. FELLER and AFSHAR have recently

renewed their friendship.

After these two unknown men left Mr. FELLER'S

office, he called AFSHAR on his private telephone in

Washington, D.C. and advised him of the above incident.

They speculated as to how the two men could have connected

MI. FELLER with AFSHAR and concluded that AFSHAR'S

phone was probably tapped and their conversations had

been. overheard.

connection

with an allegation that an Iranian student in Paris:

had stated that

Government.

BARARENI denied being an Savak agent.

He

explained that members of the Iranian Student AssociatiOn

him because

as

a result of his speech making and witing;

he has received substantial media attention in the

past three years, while the ISA have demonstrated against

the shah for years with little or no success.

He also

speculated that Savak had infiltrated the ISA.

contacted him and advised that he had seen him on television

and wished to renew old acquaintances.

Mr. AFSHAR said SELLER

owns a small chemical manufacturing plant at Valley Stream,

Long Island, New York, and is manufacturing chenicals mainly

for agricultural purposes.

Mx. AFSHAR has foreign business

contacts and SELIER has recently approached him about represent-

ing him in the sale of agricultural chemicals in foreign

Mr. AFSHAR said that on June 17, 1977, SELLER

telephonically advised him that on Tuesday, June 14, 1977,

two men came to his office and inquired if

he was acquainted

with AFSHAR.

SELLER replied that he was and they immediately

began to beat him with their fists. SELLER has some sort of

burglar alarm in his office which he was able to activate and

the Valley Stream, New York, Police appeared on the scene

almost immediately and arrested the two men who were beating

SELLER.

with assaulting him.

According to AESHAR, SELLER said one of

these men requested to make a telephone call and was given

permission to do so.

The person he called is unknown

AFSHAR out SELLER said that within five minutes after this,

man made the telephone call, the Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA) telephonically contacted the Chief of Police of Valley

Stream, New York, and asked him to convince SELLER not to press

charges against these men.

The GIA promised that the men would

be deported if the charges were dropped. At the urging of the

Valley Stream Chief of Police, SELLER dropped charges and the

two men were released. Their present whereabouts and status

are unknown to SELLER according to AFSHAR.

Mr. AFSHAR said the above incident disturbs him

very much as he feels SAVAK is responsible for the beating of

SELLER.

MI•-AISHAR feels that they are attempting to

intimidate him through SELLER and he wonders how SAVAK knew

of their association.

On June 23, 1977, NASSER AFSHAR, supra,

advised the

correct telephone number for HERMAN HARVEY SELLER is (516)

825-2424.

He furnished the name and address of SELLER's

company as Shock M. Oall Company, Post Office Box 272, Valley

Stream, New York.

Diractor's See'y-

To recommend priority attention be given to preparation of

video tapes which are to support presentations before Senate and House

Select Committees on Intelligence during January and February, 1978.

DETAILS:

During early February, 1978, an appearance by either

Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams or Assistant Director

T. W. Leavitt is planned before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence;

in addition, the House Select Committee on Intelligence will be similarly

briefed in the near future. In order to dramatize graphically the constant

threat to national security posed by Hostile Intelligence Services, a video-

tape presentation of approximately 20 minutes is felt to be most desirable.

Senate staff members have specifically requested such a film as one of

the most effective ways to dramatize our problems for the Senators.

At the present time, the Instructional Technological Services

Staff, Training Division, have advised the Intelligence Division (INTD)

they have a number of important projects; but, in view of the short dead-

lines for the preparation of a suitable presentation, INTD believes that

this project should be given priority status.

RECOMMENDATION:

REC

Chile but was deported and is presently employed as a staff

membor with the Senate Select Cormittee on Intelligence

employment with the SSCIA a charge was made that he had leaked

classified information.

There is no indication that the CIA reports

observed under Lawton's bed were classified, which is a

necessary element for

instituting investigations under the

espionage statutes.

Furthermore, investigations regarding leaks of

classified information are initiated at the specific

instructions of the Department, which to date has not

tion that Lawton leaked classified information while with

based upon this information, there is no justification

for any independent action on their pari abroad rogarding

Lawton.

However, should the FBI feel that Lawton is of

sufficient interest to make a written formal request con

sistent with the Attorney General's guidelines, CIA will

consider conducting investigation abroad.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

DETAILS: On 4/9/76, WFO, while conducting an applicant

investigation, determined from Edwin C. Loureiro, captioned

subject's landlord, that while cleaning subject's apartment,

he noticod pictures of Joseph Stalin and Fidel Castro hang-

ing In the apartment, as well as an assortment of communist

literatue and what appeared to be CIA reports in paperback

PURPOSE: To propose incentive awards for James C. Brennan,

GS-4, and I. Earlene Stanley, GS-5.

DETAILS: Mr. Brennan and Miss Stanley were assigned to the

Senstudy 75 Special in January and February, 1976,

respectively, assuming roles on this significant Special which had

been handled by others who, in light of other compelling circumstances,

were reassigned rather abruptly. There follows a summary of specific

facets of their performance which have been clearly beyond what would

have been normally called for in this-situatioi REC-89 2

=7:

Miss Stanley had but minimal training of a few hours in

taking on her new duties; Brennan likewise had but limited training

time. They both, with a minimum of supervision, demonstrated

imagination and initiative in meeting a variety of problems and per-

formed their duties in a manner well beyond what would have been

acceptable. The following is illustrative: They devised and refined

an elaborate indexing system for the Special, enabling us to quickly

locate and retrieve relevant correspondence with a minimum of infor-

mation. This has proven invaluable to all levels of Bureau ofticials

and supervisors who frequently call. upon us for information relating

to the Special. They set up and refined an elaborate tickler system

for the voluminous substantive and administrative correspondence.

generated by the Special, thus facilitating our day-to-day work.

22 COT

Many times working under compelling time limitations, they assisted

numerous supervisors in the excising and duplication of documents

and served as couriers to expedite materials to Bureau and Depart

mental officials. Working with Records Management Division

employees, they have innovated procedures for the location, segre

gation and integration into our files of a vast amount of material

heretofore maintained only as ticklers. Another task performed by

them, significantly beyond what would be called for by their Grade

level, consisted of their preparation of abstracts (precise summaries

of lengthy documents) for inclusion in a Community Index maintained

by the Director, Central Intelligence. As an adjunct to the Special,

they have located, isolated, excised and duplicated a large volume

of documents concerning a particular subject which had been given

to the Church Committee so it may now be given, at the Attorney

General's instructions, to the subject's estate. This effort, like

most all the others performed by these two employees, was of a

pioneering nature requiring innovative techniques. Their overall

performance contributed immeasurably toward fulfilling the

Bureau's responsibilities in this matter.

RECOMMENDATION: That Mr. Brennan and Miss Stanley be granted

incentive awards, the amount to be determined

by the Finance and Personnel Division.

NCONTAINED

HEREINE

This is in response to your recent telephonic

request of me concerning what steps might be taken by your

office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to

accommodate requests of U. S.

Senator Robert Morgan of

North Carolina for authorization for public release of

certain FBI documents.

The following is set forth to

present this matter in a complete context and to submit

to you at the same time my suggestions and observations.

Senator Morgan was a member of the SSC. As such

he had access to the FBI documents submitted to the SSC

during its extensive review of FBI operations.

In response to requests of the SSC and its

staff and in accordance with agreed to procedures we

delivered to the SSC staff on August 28, 1975, several

documents that related to our investigations and

Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) directed against

the Klan in North Carolina. These documents were excised

individually to exclude data that would obviously identify

informants.

The nature of these particular documents is

such that when compared with each other the identity of a

former FBI Klan intormant,

George Dorsett, can be deduced.

This fact was recognized by the SSC, or its staff, and in

fact a notation "IDENTS SOURCE" was made on the face of one

of the documents after they were delivered to the SSC.

## Page 71

The Attorney General

On December 5 and 6, 1975, various North Carolina

news media reported Senator Morgan's statements to the effect

that the FBI formed and provided operating funds for the

Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (CKKKK) in the 1960's

to disrupt and counter the existing United Klans of America

He described the nature of the Uka, i.e. the alleged promotion

of Americanism,

white supremacy and segregation of the races.

He alluded to the anti-Negro, anti-Semitic nature of the UKA

and the involvement

of Klan members and leaders in the

past in atrocities including beatings, bombings and murders

as well as involvement in activities seeking to deny others

their Constitutional rights.

He described the UKA klaverns

North Carolina as having the same aims and purposes as the

national organization.

He specifically stated "It recently has been

widely reported that the FBI has been responsible for

organizing new chapters or klaverns of the Klan. At no

time was the FBI directly responsible for the organizing ot any

new Klan chapter or klavern."

He denied that FBI informants

were ever instructed to advocate, initiate or engage in acts

of violence.

It appears that this press release by the SAC of the

Charlotte Office has been considered by Senator Morgan as a

challenge to his credibility. Apparently senator Morgan teels

that if the FBI documents from which he has formed his

conclusions are released to the public, the dispute can be

resolved.

The documents in question are enclosed in two forms.

In one form they are the same as provided to the SSc.

In the

other they are excised more extensively, to which I will

refer later.

The Attorney General

Particular attention is directed to the August 22, 1967,

airtel from SAC, Charlotte to Director, FBI, which sets forth

the formulation of the CKKKK.

This document sets forth steps

being taken in conjunction with an informant to utilize the

CKKIK as a disruptive effort directed against the UKA.

is realized that this document gives the impression that the

FBI formed the CKKKK.

Attention is also directed to SAG, Charlotte, airtel

to Director, FBl, dated September 12, 1967• In paragraph one,

page one of this document it is specifically stated that the

Charlotte Office desired to continue to capitalize on the

dissension between Dorsett and UKA Grand Dragon without having

to form a separate organization.

"However, those former UKA

members who followed Dorsett were adamant in their intentions

to form

another organization, and in order to put the Bureau

in the best position possible (deleted) became Grand Dragon of

this new group."

This same communication specifically requests FBI

Headquarters to authorize the paying of at least a portion of the

expenses relating to the formation of the CKKKK.

By airtel dated September 25, 1967, from Director,

FBI, tO SAC,

Charlotte, it is stated,

"The Bureau will not,

under any circumstances, approve the paying, by your office,

of all expenses in connection with the formation of the new

Klan organization known as the Confederate Knights of the Ku

Klux Klan (CKKKK) by (deleted). The Bureau will, however,

approve justifiable personal expenses incurred by the

informant in this regard."

By memorandum to you dated December 19, 1975,

I enclosed a proposed memorandum for delivery to

Senator

frank Church,

Chairman of the SSC.

These memoranda

advised of the disclosure in the December 10, 1975,

"Greensboro Daily

"Senate Intelligence Committee

In these memoranda I enumerated several documents that

were delivered to the SSC by the FBI and which when

examined as

The Attorney General

to you a

issue of

captioned

Confirms Spy Within KKK,

A copy of this news article is also enclosed herewith.

this memorandum I again requested that this matter be brought

to the attention of Senator Church.

It is my understanding that the above incidents were

not referred to the SSG.

I wish to point out that Mr. Dorsett's identity as

an ibs intormant has not been publicly acknowledged by the.

FBl nor to the extent of my knowledge by Mr. Dorsett.

By letter dated May 11, 1976, Senator Morgan requested

of you the clearance for

release of the documents in question.

A copy of Senator Morgan's letter is also enclosed.

I and my staff have given this natter very serious

consideration.

I feel that the documents should not be

approved for release inasmuch as the request is a personal

request of Senator Morgan; the request is not a request of

the SSC: it is not related to SSC business; the SSC has had

numerous

hearings relating to the material

covered in these

documents and has issued its report; the SSC no longer has

standing to conduct business; it is felt nothing is to be

past specific incidents; Senator Morgan entered into the

Congressional Record on May 10, 1976, my May 8, 1976, remarks

at Fulton, Missouri, and Senator Morgan at that time stated

his agreement with my remarks.

In Senator Morgan's letter he also requested the

approval for public release of certain documents relating to

the Black Panther Party (BPP) and COINTELPRO actions directed

against the BPP in North Carolina.

In regard to these documents

(copies of which are also enclosed in two formats) it should

be noted that Larry Donnell Little, who as BPP Leader was

the person most affected by the COINTELPRO actions, was advised by

your Special Review Cormittee of the fact COINTELPRO actions

were taken against him.

Little is believed to be currently

The Attorney General

running for Alderman in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and

disclosure of these documents at this time could be construed

as an improper intrusion into local politics by the

Federal Government.

In an interview of Little reported in the

December 20, 1975, issue of the

""Winston-Salem Chronicle,"

Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Little is quoted as being

aware of the Freedom of Information Act as a means of

obtaining material from FBI files.

In the event you feel that this matter can better

be resolved by the public release of these documents, they

have been examined and additional excisions made which,

should they be released, will not disclose the identity of an

informant.

Copies of the documents with these excisions are

enclosed herewith. fIt is noted that these documents in

this format were provided to you by memorandum dated

July 9, 1976.

I have also given consideration to the submission of

a letter to Senator Morgan either over your signature or mine,

which letter would acknowledge that the FBI did exploit the

CKKKK as a means of disrupting the UKA. I interpose no

objection to such a letter providing it is worded in such a

nanner that a specific inIormant is not identitled not

Senator Morgan'

s disclosure of this informant is acknowledged.

Any such letter should of course accurately set forth the events

based on the information contained in these documents which I

feel is accurately summarized above.

Senator Morgan has expressed his concern about a

critical reaction in North Carolina to his statements critical of

the FBl by former FBl employees. Senator Morgan has implied

that he considers such reactions as being orchestrated by the FBI.

Such is not so and I would trust that Senator Morgan would

accept my statement to this effect in good faith.

The FBI

does not in any manner direct the activities of former FBI

employees, either to perform or to desist.

I hope that this summary will aid you in determining

the most effective means of meeting the request of

senator Morgan. I wish to emphasize that neither 1 nor my

staff desires to pursue a position of obstinance in this situation.

I regret the delay in responding to your letter of April 9, request retor sees

that the NSC Staff approve the release of certain materials to the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. We have now

completed our review of the subject documents and offer the fol-

lowing comment.

We have no objection to the release of the November 6, 1950

memorandum from J. Patrick Coyne to J. Edgar Hoover and Raymond

Whearty or the November 8, 1950 letter from J. Edgar Hoover to J.

Patrick Coyne, along with the enclosure entitled "Report by the Inter-

departmental Intelligence Conference to the National Security Council

Regarding the Recent Outbreak of Violence by Puerto Rican Nationalists. "

Concerning the report discussing internal security programs in the

United States under the control of the IIC, enclosed with the July 25,

1961 letter from Mr. Hoover to McGeorge Bundy, the NSC Staff has

determined that it should not be released in its present form. From

the information contained in this report, it appears that events could

be reconstructed so as to identify confidential FBI sources, the pro-

tection of which is essential to our intelligence operations. There-

fore before this document may be released to the Senate Select Com

mittee it should be carefully reviewed and the information it contains

PURPOSE: The purpose of this memorandum is to advise of the

receipt of a letter dated August 12th from author Ladislas

Farago, enclosing a copy of a letter that Farago wrote to

Senator Walter Mendale; member of the Senate Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence

Activities (SSIC), in which Farago inquires regarding the full

text of a quotation from an FBI memorandum regarding Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr., which appears 'on page 121 of Book III of the

SSIC's Final Report.

DETAILS:

Ladislas Farago is a well-known author who currently

is completing an in-depth biography of J. Edgar Hoover. By.

letter dated August 12th, he has sent Mr. Kelley a copy of a

letter he wrote Senator Walter Mondale. In that letter he

attention to the following quotation regarding the FBI's

investigative coverage of Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., which

appears on page 121 of Book III of the SSIC's Final Report:

"Justifying

the need

for the microphone coverage, the

Chief of the

FBI's Internal Security Section wrote that

the FBI was 'attempting' to obtain information about 'the

(private) activities of DI. King and his associates' so

that Dr. King could be 'completely discredited.'"

In his letter to Senator Mondale, Farago points out

that it would have been more proper to have quoted verbatim

from the FBI memorandum, rather than to have paraphrased it in

the manner done on page 121 of Book III.

He asks Senator Mondale

Monroe to Moore memo

RE: INQUIRY FROM LADISIAS FARAGO

The FBI memo in question is dated January 28, 1964p and

captioned

"Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist

Influence in Racial Matters, Internal Security - Communist. " The

| full text of the data in question regarding Dr. King is:

"Because of the communist influence on him, he

needs to be, for the security of the Nation, completely

discredited.

An obvious means to this end is through his

moral weaknesses and we are attempting to obtain as many

facts as possible relative to his low morals with a view

to effectively using this information. The activities of

King and his associates at the Willard Hotel in Washington,

D.C.,

1/6-7/64 have demonstrated the potential for us in

effecting technical coverage."

A comparison of the above-quoted data with the

paraphrased account of it that appears in the Final Report of

the SSIC does, of course, reflect substantial differences.

The material which the FBI provided to the SSIC in

1975-76 has since been turned over by the SSIC to the recently

formed Senate Select Committee on Intelligence which is headed by

Senator Daniel K. Inouye.

Thus, Senator Mondale (who served on

the SSIC, and to whom Farago addressed his letter requesting

full text of the January 28, 1964, FBI memorandum) does not

have access to the data requested

by tarago.

Senator Mondale

probably will refer Farago's request to Senator Inouye; and

in response to the virtually identical request that Farago

has made of Mr. Kelley, it is felt that the Bureau should

suggest to him that he

contact Senator Inouye's new Intelli-

gence Committee.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum be approved and returned

to the External Affairs Division so that receipt of Farago's

letter can orally be acknowledged, at which time he will be

told that his request for the text of the January 28, 1964,

Intelligence Committee.

My dear Director Kelley:

I take the liberty of sending you herewith copy of a let-

ter I have just written to Senator Mondale which, I am con-

fident, speaks for Itself. I cannot overemphasize the import-

ance of the issue I am raising. The possibility that the Church

Committee staff has added the word "private" to the Baumgard-

ner memorandum is the acid test of their bias and proof posi-

tive of the tendentiousness of their entire report. I am hope-

ful that it will be possible either for Senator Mondale or

for you, my dear Mr. Director, to make available to me a copy

of the entire Beumgardner memorandum for my inspection.

Permit me, sir, to take this opportunity to congratulate

you on your remarkable "performance" at your press confe-

rence on August 11, and to thank you for your efforts of plac-

ing this whole matter in the proper perspective. As one of

the gratifying results of your presentation I noticed the edi-

torial in this morning's New York Times which seemed to me

the first more or less objective treatment of the topic and

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

My dear Senator Mondale:

• I was gratified by your selection and nomination, and thrill at the prospect

of your election as our vice president in the Carter Administration. For a long

time, having watched your performance in the Senate and on the Church Conmittee,

I was hoping for such recognition. I have come to be convinced that our nation

would be restored to its historic path of basic decency if a politician like

you would be moved to the top or near the top in the Executive Branch. I con-

gratulate you on your nomination and wish you (and us) the best in November.

This, however, is not why I am writing, except that I am delighted to have

this opportunity to express my sentiments. I understand that you were in super-

visory charge of the Church Conmittee's monumental reportage on the Federal

Bureau of Investigation--monumental, indeed, for your young staff did a prodi-

gious job in researching the FBI story and performed a heroic task in unearth-

ing data to justify your misgivings and document your charges.

However, I am not as impressed with what should have been mandatory objec-

tivity of your staff in the exploitation and presentation of this vast research

fund. The authors of your reports on the FBI were evidently overwhelmed by the

negative aspects of their raw material and permitted themselves to be carried

into pronounced bias which is evident on practically every page of their re-

I am writing what I hope will be the definitive biography of the late Di-

rector, called "The Secret American: A Political Biography of J. Edgar Hoover--

Triumph or Tragedy." It will be published in 1977, by Doubleday, and made into

a motion picture by zuth Century-fox, on the pattern of my other movies,

"'Patton"' and "Tora, Tora, Tora."

I was held up in the completion of this difficult book by the delays and

vIcissitudes of your investigation. Now I am rather pleased to say that, in the

final analysis, it produced very little that was new to me or anything funda-

mental that would have altered my essentially positive attitude to the Bureau

that far too much emphasis was placed by your

Conmittee on the sod and sinister mustole an hit a c

the Bureau's work and Hoover's regime, that, of course, encompassed far, far

greater areas than you had time or inclination to cover.

This was especially true in the Martin. Luther King syndrome that, please

believe me, is not as simple and cut-and-dry as it appears in the present-

ation of your conspicuously partisan staff. This is what bothers me and why

I am seeking your urgent help, in order to clarify a deeply disturbing matter

emerging. from your final report. On page 121 in Book III, under caption

"C. Microphone Surveillance of Dr. King: January 1964-November 1965 (which

incidentally is the only such caption printed exclusively in capital letters,

for extra emphasis, I guess), a quotation appears in fragmented form from

a mysterious memorandum attributed to Frederick Baumgardner and dated Ja-

nuary 28, 1964, according to footnote 170 on the same page. This is how

"Justifying the need for microphone coverage, the Chief of the FBI's

so hat on.

Internal Security Section wrote that the FBI was 'attempting' to obtair

information about 'the [private] activities of Dr. King and his associates'

so that Dr. King could be 'completely discredited.'"

The following passages are cited in quotation marks apparently added by

the author of your report:

1. "attempting"

2. "the private activities of Dr. King and his associates"

3. "completely discredited"

The following word is put in brackets, either-by Mr. Baumgardner in the

original document or by the author of your report quoting from it:

[private]

To my mind, this is the key document of this particular subject, present-

ing what your

author himself described as the justification of the microphone

surveillance of Dr. King. It would have been better and more proper if the

sentence had been quoted verbatim instead in its paraphrased form with quo-

tation marks and, apparently, brackets added. In this form one cannot know,

in the evaluation of this justification; was what written by Mr. Baumgardner

and what was added by your author, and the contours of fakery and fraud are

thus permitted to cast a reflection on the entire report.

I must know whether the bracketed word "private" was in the original or

had been added, presumably to shift the emphasis of the Baumgardner memoran-

dum and, of course, of the FBI's "attempt to obtain information"; jas Ndll las

of the very nature of the information the Bureau was "attempting" to obtain.

I must know the entire context in which the words "completely discredited"

were used by Baumgardner and the purpose of the truncated quotation as pre-

sented by your staff.

The simplest solution of the problem would be if you would, post festa,

publish the full text of the Baumgardner memorandum, a step that would be

justified by the importance of the memo itself and its significance to your

presentation and argumentation. If this proves impossible at this stage of the

game, I would greatly appreciate it if you would make a copy of the memo

randum available to me in its entirety, so that I could determine the ac-

tual formulation of the Bureau's reasons for the microphonic surveillance

of Dr. King and the basic background of the project. I am sending a copy

of this letter to Director Kelley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

with the request that he help me in the procurement of an authentic copy

of the Baumgardner memorandum; and I am writing to Messrs. William C. Sul-

livan and Frederick Baumgardner, asking them to clarify this matter for me.

my ultimate you for your cooperation in this critical matter, on which

judgment of the authenticity and fairness of your presentation

necessarily hinges, I remain, with warm regards, and good wishes,

respectfully yours,

SENATE SALECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGCCE ACTIVIIICS (SSC)

In considering this matter, it should be noted that the

SSC was very repetitive in sore of its reporting,

particularly concerning the Martin Luther King, Jr.,

investigation and COINIELPRO. For example, the same

data concerning the King matter appears in two portions

of Book II (Introcuction and Summary, and Findings) as

well as the detailed case study included in Book III.

Iven vithin Book III, there vere noted duplicate references

to the same issue.

Similar duplications of reporting

vere noted as to COITELPRO.

In the interests of brevity, this critique

vill not repeat our observations once nade although the

objectionable material or presentation may be repeated.

Also, we will not repeat those observations previously

made

in our earlier memoranda but merely refer below to

those earlier observations found to apply to finished

reports as they did for the drafts. Finally, we have

concentrated in this presentation on what we consider

the more significant objections, to the exclusion of

minor and marginal matters.

COINIELPRO:

FBI nenorandun dated March 15, 1976, contained

our observations after the review of the draft of the

SSC's case study concerning COINTOLPRO. Our merorandun

dated pril 15, 1976, contained our observations of the

draft of that portion of the SSC Report, Bool: II, headed

Findings.

Jost of our prior observations relating to

COIVIOLPRO ratters in the above tio memoranda are applicable

to the final versions of Books II and III. In sunmary,

it is our corment that the material in Bool: III continues

to include many editorialized comments and distortions.

It is replete with itens taken out of context, selected

proniscuously to support an SSC conclusion without regard

to other information available to the Committee, and

set forth in a manner to depict this Bureau in a most

derogatory fashion. Selected quotes of various past

and present FBI personnel are set forth to support the

contention of improper or illegal activities, while other

material presented to the Committee by FBI deposers, or

referred to the Conmittee in documentary form, is ignored

or played down.

FBI Investigation of Martin Luther King. JI.:

FBI menorandum dated April 8, 1976, contained

our observations after the review of the draft of the

SSC's case study concerning Martin Luther King, JI. Our

memorandum dated April 15, 1976, contained our observations

of the draft of that portion of

the SSC Report, Book II,

headed Findings.

In respect to the objectionable material and

presentations contained in the drafts and then repeated

in the final printings, all of our prior observations in

the above-two memoranda are applicable to the final

versions of Books II and III.

The following are our

observations as to additional objectionable material and

presentations noted in the final printings.

On page 223 of Book II, it is stated, "Even

after Dr. King's death, Agents in the field were proposing

methods for harassing his widow."

Observations: It is true that a field office

of the FBI suggested counterintelligence activities against

lirs. King. However, this suggestion was disapproved by

FBI Headquarters and the field office was advised that no

counterintelligence activity against Mrs. King was desired.

SANARE SLLECT CONITIES ON INTELLIGENCE ACZIVIFISS (SSC)

It is believed that the nethod by which the SSC referred

to the suggested activity against lics. King lacks

objectivity in that it does not include the faci thai

the sugsection was rejected.

Page 146 of Bool: III contains a footnote,

number 239, which states, "It should be noted that the

Supervisor

in charge of the king case is still in a high

position with the FBI and handled the committee's documents

requests in the king case investigation."

Observations: The information as footnoted

olthough it appears that it would have been far tore

proper for it to have been included in the details rather

than as a footnote. This is highly significant becauso,

and nore importantly, it is suggestive of being a gross

reporting abuse. The information quoted was not included

in the drait of

the report which ve vore permitted to

review. Its addition, after our review of the draft, has

chus prevented our rightful ability to revier this itcu.

Page 86 of Bool: III, in discussing the FBI's

acquisition of infomation about King's personal life,

stated, "lorcover, in order to preclude any further

dissemination of infornation obtained during the electronic

surveillances of I. King, the Cormittee requested the

IBI to excise fron all documents submitted to the Committee

any information which tas so obtained."

Observations: the implication in the above

reporting is that the SSC attempted to avoid securing fron

the FBI infornation concerning King's personal life. He

are of the view that the SSC did not adequately provide

for its not being furnished such information. At no tire

any of the numerous SSC requests for infornation

concerning King specifically ask that ve

not furnish

personal activity information. The SSC did exclude fron

its requests, by specific wording, information derived

as the products of electronic surveillances on King himself.

While it is true that this exclusion did result in our

not furnishing nich such information to the SSC, it is

also true that ve did furnish information concerning King's

personal life and activities where such information net

the criteria of the requests and did not derive fron

clectronic surveillances on King. In short, the SS's

exclusions were in terms of sources rather than contents.

On pages 87 and 88 of Bool: III, it is reported

that in 1962 the fBI ordered its field offices to revier

their files for "subversive" information about King and to

submit that information to FBI Headquarters in reports

"sultable for dissemination."

Footnote mait? 27 on

page 88 identifies the specific FBI Headquarters commi-

nication in this matter and ends with a statement that

these instructions to the field were issued on the first

day of king's trial in which he and 700 other civil rights

deconstrators vere charged in ilbany, Georgia, vith

parading tithout a pernit.

Observations: The nanner in which the foregoing

was reported implies that FBI Headquarters' Instructions

vere affected by the trial. There is no evidence that

they were.

On page 111 of Bool: III appears the statcrent,

"The instruction to use 'all possible investigative techniques

appears to have dictated the intensification of the

COLTIFIL investigation of the SCLC." The quoted portion

is in reference to a letter from the Director, FBI, to a

Special Agent in Charge dated October 1, 1963, which is

idontified as footnote number 126 and which letier is

quoted on pages 110 and 111.

The significant portion of

this letter is the sentence which starts, "fullest considcration

should be given to the use of all possible investigative

techniques in the investigation . . . ."

## Page 116

SINATE SILECT COMMITTEE ON INTELZIGENCE ACTIVITIRS (SSC)

Observations: It will be noted thai the Bureau

communication which was documented uses the language,

"Fullest consideration should be given... ." On the

other hand, the language of the SSC report is that the

instruction was to use all possible investigative techniques.

Surely the SSC ought to be able to distinguish between an

instruction to consider using sonething versus on

instruction to actually use sonething. This, to our mind,

is not objective reporting.

On page 141 of Book III appears a discussion

concerning an IBI effori to dissuade a university from

avarding King an honorary degree. Footnote number 257 cites

an FBI menorandum from Frederick Baumgardner to William

Sullivan dated March 4, 1964, and states that the officer

who handled the assignment was given a letter of

commendation by the Director, "and a monetary award."

Observations: The cited menorandun verifies

the conferring of the letter of commendation but makes no

mention whatsoever of a monetary award and no such award

was received for this assignment by the "officer." While

it is recognized that the discrepancy here is a relatively

minor one in that we acknowledge the recognition given

to the "officer," we believe that this instance of

inaccurate reporting of the facts should be brought to

notice.

General Observation: While a tremendous number

of footnotes were used in the little over 100-page King

case study, 455 in number, there nevertheless aprear in

these pages many statements by the SSC which are not

documented and frequently fall in the general area of

supposition, opinion, conclusion and the like.

Informants:

Use of Infornants in FBI Intelligence Investigations,"

pages 225-270. leview disclosed the following nisleading

conclusions.

Some of the conclusions are that the IBI

conducts political investigations of organizations and

indivicuals through the use of informants.

Observations: Luring FBI testicony bofore the

Committee, it las repeatedly stated that wa did not use

informants for political purposes and all conclusions of

this nature vere denied by IBI officials. Horever, the

FBI denials of these conclusions vere given only ninimal

exposure in the report.

In particular, the SSC nade the broad allegation

Chat informants engaged

in illezal and violent activities,

implying that it was with Bureau approval, which was

strongly denied during the course of the SSC hearings.

Again, however, the denials were given only minimal

treatnent in the Report.

In general, the foregoing 1s

also applicable to the material in Book II related to the

use of fBI informants.

Surreptitious Intries:

In discussing varrantless breal-ins by the FBI,

page 13 of Book II contains a statement, "In sone cases,

these break-ins vere to install microphones; in other cases,

they were to steal such items as membership lists fron

Observations: Organizations characterized as

"subversive" were so characterized pursuant to Executive Order

Observations: Statistics listed In the above-

referred-to footnotes

case studies on the subject of surreptitious entries in

the forn of an Appendix. When the FBI was permitted to

review the draft of that case study, it was found that the

statistics in that ippendix vould require a classification

of "Secret." FBI representatives brought this to the

attention of SSC Staff Nembers John Illiff, Fred Daron and

Janes Dick on April 26, 1976, and they agreed to delete

the ippendi in the printing of the case study. the

deletion was made and the statistics do not appear in the

case study which is a part of Bool: III. Horever, by

footnoting the classified material in the manner doscribed

above, the SSC, in effect, entered substantive infomation

which, had it been included in the details of the draft of

FBI Special Indices/Custodial Detention List (CDL)

Pages 34-36, Bool: II, contain Infornation under

a heading entitled "Control by the ittocney General:

Compliance and Resistonce," which concerns the CDi. It is

reported that in 1943, Attorney General Diddle ordered that

- 8 -

NW 54928 DocId: 32989595 Page 118

## Page 119

SENATE SALICE COMMITTOE OI INTELLIGLKCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

the CDI should be abolished as "impractical, unvise and

dangerous." His directive stated that there was "no

statutory or other present justification'for keeping the

list.

The SSC claims that, "Upon receipt of this order,

the fBI Director did not in fact abolish its list. The

FBI continued to maintain an index of persons 'ho nay be

to the Attorney General's order, the FBI merely changed the

name of the list fron Custodial

Detention List to Security

Index.

Instructions to the field stated that the Security

Inder should be kept 'strictly confidential,' and that

it should never be rentioned in FBI reports or 'discussed

with agencies or individuals outside the Bureau' except

for military intelligence agencies."

The SSC report then goes on to state, "This

incident provides an exarple of the FBI's ability to

conduci domestic intelligence operations in opposition

to the policies of an ittorney General. Despite attorney

General, Biddle's order, the "dangerousness' list continued

continue to be a signtficant part of the bureau lot

Observations: As noted above, the report stated

that the Attorney General "ordered that

the Custodial

Decention List should be abolished as 'impractical, unise,

and dangerous! " A review of a nenorandun fron Attorney

Ceneral Biddle to Assistant Attorney General Hugh B. Cox

and J. Edgar Hoover dated July 16, 1943, reveals that the

Actorney General nade no such staterent. The ncuorandum

does state, "Thore is no statutory authorization or other

present justification for keeping a 'custodial detention'

list of citizens." It is our contention that this statenent

does not effect an order to abolish the CDL. Further, when

the FBI changed the name of the cards and list to Security

Index, it was to be utilized in investigating dangerous

and potentially dangerous individuals other than alien

enemies, but no mention of detention was made in connection

with the list.

On page 69, Book II, under a heading entitled

"Domestic Covert Action," appears a statement, "The Security

Index was revised to include such persons." This statement

refers to a previous statement indicating that the mosi

intensive domestic intelligence investigations, and

frequently COMIELPRO operations, were targeted against

persons identified not as criminals or as criminal suspects

but as "rabble rousers," "agitators," "key activists," or

"Key black extrenists," because of militant shetoric and

leadership.

Observations: The Security Index vas never

revised to include cabble rousers, agitators, key activists.

or others as listed in the SSC report. Individuals were

placed on the Security Index if, during the investigation

of a particular individual, certain criteria for such

placement vere met. An individual could be defined as a

rabble rouser, etc., and have been on the Security Index;

however, as noted previously, the Index was not revised for

the purpose of including such persons.

On page 72, Book II, under a heading entitled

"'New Left' Intelligence," there is set forth infornation

from SAC (Special Agent in Charge) Letter 68-21, dated

April 2, 1968, which advised field offices of areas of inquiry

regarding subjects of New Lift investigations and of informa-

tion which during the investigations might establish a potential

threat to security. The report continues that such porsons would

also be placed on the Security Index (for detention in time

of emergency) because of "anarchistic tendencies" even 1f

membership in a subversive organization could not be proven.

Footnote number 293 states that this SAC jetter did caution

- 10 -

HH 54928 DocId: 32989595 Page 120

## Page 121

SENATE SELECT CONMITURE ON INTELLICENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

that "nere dissent and opposition to Govermental policies

pursued in a legel and constitutional nannen: was "not

sufficient to varcont inclusion in the Security Index."

It further indicated that "anti-Vietnam or peace group

sentiments" were not supposed to justify investigation.

The footnote then states, "The failure of this acconition

to achieve lis stated objective is discussed in the tindings

on 'Overbreadth' and 'Covert Action to Disrupt.' "

Observations: Instructions were issued to the

field regarding investigations of indivicuals affillated

with the dew left, as reported above. Horever, although

the report indieates such parsons would be placed on the

Security Index, a more correct statement should have been

that if the activities of an individual net the criteria

for inclusion on the Security Index, the Individual may

have been placed thereon.

Conmencinz on page 125, Fool: II, under a heading

encitled "Ine IBI's Sceret "Adninistrative Index,' " the

report states that during the Fall of 1971, the Eureau

was confronted with the prospect of the first serious

cations, refering

gations, referring to repeal of the Emergency Detention ict

until 1973." The repori indicates that, in the evant the

IDA was repenled, the FBI intended to contime as before

the repcal took place, and following the repeal, established

a rationale for keeping the Security Index of potentially

dangerous individuals. The report states, "FBI officials

hoped there rould be a say to circunvent the repeal 'in which

the essence of the Security Index and energency detention

of dangerous Individuals could be utilized under Presidential

powers.* "

The repori then goes on to describe various

menoranda which were vritten during the time frame

immediately preceding and following the repeal of the EDs.

Memoranda preceding the repeal did indicate that, is the

Act was repealed, there night be some future date when an

emergency could occur and Congress could possibly be

convinced to reinstitute such emergency procedures as

outlined in the IDA. The report indicates that following

the repeal the Attorney General was advised by letter of

the FBI's proposal to maintain an Administrative Index (Adex)

of individuals who would pose a threat to the internal

security of the country.

iccording to the report, the

letter made no reference to the theory prevailing vithin

the FBI that this new Index would serve as a basis for a

revived detention program at sone future date during an

emergency, The report indicates that, when the attorney

General advised the FBI that the repeal of the ids did not

prohibit the FBI fron compiling an Adex, he did not deal

with the question of whether the Index would also serve as

a round-up lisi for a future emergency. It is noted that

the Actorney Cencral olso stated that the Departuent did

not desire a copy of the new Index and, therefore, abdicated

even the minimal supervisory role performed previously by

the Lepartrent in its review of the Security Index. Such

an Indes as established placed the FBI in the position of

being able to make the sole determination as to which

individuals should be placed thereon. The report indicates

that there vere tro major consequences of the new systen in

that the Indes was expanded to include an "elastic category:

"the new breed of subversive'" and the Reserve Index, thich

"had never been disclosed to the Justice Department, was

incorporated into the idministrative Index."

The report

further sets forth onc of the standards for including an

indivicual on the Adex to indicatc the breadth of this list.

These criteria vere furnished the Department in 1972 and

"the Attorney General did not question the fact that the

Administrative Index vas more than an administrative aid for

conducting investigations, as he had previously been told."

One memorandum indicated a representative of the Department

agreed with the view held that there might be circumstances

therein it would be necessary to quickly identify

individuals who were a threat to the national security

and the President could then go to Congress for emergency

legislation permitting apprehension and detention. This

section of the report concludes by indicating that, although

the Attorney General did not formally authorize the Adex

as a continuance of the previous detention list, there was

Informal Departmental knowledge that the FBI vould proceed

on that basis, and later one FBI official recognized that

the Adex could be interpreted as a means to circumvent

repeal of the IDA.

On page 127, under a heading entitled "Reconsideration

of FBI Authority," a discussion ensues regarding the

authority of the FBI to conduct domestic intelligence

investigations and notes that the Bureau relied on various

Executive Orders for its basis for authority in this field

and that there was no indication that FBI guidelines

material or manual provisions were submitted to or requested

by the Justice Department prior to 1972. As a result of

studies during that time period, the Bureau proceeded to

revise pertinent manual sections and Adex standards. As

a result of these revisions, it was intended that the Adex

vould be trimmed to those who were "an actual danger not."

The revision of the manual was completed in 1973 and applied

existing Federal statutes as a basis for the investigations

in the domestic area.

Upon instituting these new standards,

the Department of Justice was then furnished copies of the

manual section for domestic subversive investigations.

Footnoces in this section furnish a description

of the new breed of subversive as being in essence a

nihilist plotting to overthrow the United States Government

in a vulnerable position if FBI guidelines were scrutinized

by interested Congressional committees.

Observations: The entire

theme of the SSC report

regarding the formation of the Adex is that such an index was

established primarily to evade the will of Congress and

continue as a listing of persons to be apprehended during

time of emergency.

It is suggested that this section is a

highly opinionated treatment of an extremely controversial

subject and one which was prepared through the select use of

quoted passages in an attempt to prove that the FBI was

evading the will of Congress.

The report indicates that the

course relating to the Adex was pursued by the FBI until such

time as inquiries were made as to fBl authority to conduct

domestic intelligence investigations, and then upon fear of

disclosure of the nature of the Adex,

were changed

so the program could be used as an administrative aid as had

Memoranda were prepared at the time of the repeal of the

EDA which did discuss a temporary continuance of the old

Security Index until such time as the Attorney General could

be consulted as to possible alternatives to the EdA It

was felt at that time that such a listing should be continued

as persons so listed continued to represent a potential danger

to the national defense, and should the U. S. come under

attack by hostile forces, foreign or domestic, there was

nothing to preclude the President from going before Congress

and requesting the necessary authority to apprehend and detain

could subsequently occur.

Additionally, such a listing of subversives would

be valuable in providing Secret Service with a flow of data

concerning such individuals who could pose a threat to the

safety of the President.

Memoranda prepared indicate that

with the repeal of the EDA, the only prohibition which

concerned the FBI would preclude use of executive authority

for apprehension and detention, and Congress utilized the

language at the time of the repeal that

"no citizen is to be

Imprisoned or otherwise detained by the U. S. except pursuant

to an act of Congress."

In addition, there were discussions

that care should be taken in this regard to avoid criticism

in purcuing such a course inasmuch as it might appear to be

an attent to evade the will of Congress.

A study was conducted to determine whether repeal

of the eda removed any legal basis for security investigations

and it was concluded that the repeal would not interfere, limit,

or militate against investigations of the subversives inasmuch

as the effect would be to outlaw apprehension and detention

of subjects alleged to be dangerous in time of national emergency.

The Attorney General replied that the repeal of the

statutes, as well as subversive activity and

Upon instituting the Adex, the

criteria were tairly broad and did resemble those or the

be similar to those who had been on the former Security Index

because it was the came type of individual in which we would

have an interest during an emergency. However, although there

were similarities, it should again be noted that there werc

no longer plans for emergency apprehension and dotention since

the statute allowing for same had been repealed by Congress.

As a result of the broad criteria first utilized for the Adex,

it readily became apparent that the number of incividuals so

listed was unwieldy.

Through a careful revier during late

1972, it was determined that the only standard for inclusion

on the Ades would be whether or not an individual could be

considered as an actual danger "now."

It is our contention that although discussions were

held and memoranda proparod concerning the similarities of the

formor Security Index and the Adex, there was nothing to

proclude overtures to Congress in the event of an emergency

in order to reinstituto nasures sinilar to those provided for

in the EDA.

The purpose of the Adex was that it was to be used

as an administrative index representing a list of priority cases

then under investigation by the FBI and which could be used to

help insure that the responsibilities of the rBI would ke ful-

filled in the event of an emergency.

The Ados was established

not with a specific view of being used for detention purposes.

is our further contention that such a list was not proparca

to be used in defiance of Congress as stated in the SSC report.

Finally, the SSC report implins that the entire

Reserve Index was

included in the Adex when the latter was first

established. This is not so as only a portion of the Reserve

Index,

namely Section A, vas added to the Adex when first

established. Section A

was essentially considorod as Catagory

IV of the Adox until such time as the individual cases placco

therein could be reviewed and a determination made whether the

criteria in the new Adex under Cargory IV was met in each

individual case.

If such was not the case, the individual's

name was removed fron the idex.

During this review, the cases

of those individuals whose names were then maintained in Section

B of the old Feserve Index vere also reviewed to determine if

the activitics of any included therein then met the now Adex

criteria.

Miscellaneous:

Referring to Book Il, "Intelligence Activities and the Rights

of Americans, " the portion headed Introduction and Summary contains

material under a subheading Cost and Value. On pages 18 and 19 effort

is made to show that the FBI had sweeping domestic intelligence

surveillance programs which produced few useful returns in view of

their extent. As an example, it is stated that, "Between 1960 and

1974, the FBI conducted over 500, 000 separate investigations of

persons and groups under the 'subversive' category, predicated on

the possibility that they might be likely to overthrow the government

of the United States. " This sentence refers to footnote number 106

which states, "This figure is the number of 'investigative matters'

handled by the FBI in this area, including as separate items the

investigative leads in particular cases which are followed up by various

field offices. (FBI memorandum to Select Committee, 10/6/75. )"

Observations: The facts relating to this matter are as

follows. An SSC request dated September 12, 1975, Item 6a, asked for,

"The annual number of Bureau (headquarters) case files opened under

categories 100- and 157- for the years 1960 through 1974." Our response

was contained in a memorandum to the SSC dated October 6, 1975, which

stated that, in response to Item fa, the following information was

furnished.

There was then set out in a three-column chart showing by

specitic years, 1960 through 1974, the number. of cases opened at

Headquarters in the 100- and 15%- classifications. The total for 100-

was 49, 621. The total for 157~ was 33, 316. This made a grand total

of 82, 93%. When examining the facts as set forth above and comparing

them with what is in the SSC report, including the footnote, it is

readily apparent that the SSC has set forth a very misleading figure

when stating that, during the pertinent period, we conducted over 500, 000

separate investigations of persons. We do not know where the Sse

obtained that figure but, from the footnote which speaks about "investi-

gative matters" and "leads"' it appears that they have arrived at some

23

HH 54928

DocId: 32989595 Page 128

---

## Page 129

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

figure relating to total matters in all field offices which, in many

instances, results from counting a single case on a single individual

several times. The true number of separate investigations during

the pertinent period is barely 83, 000, which figure is so far removed

from the quoted figure of 500, 000 as to make the Committee's claim

highly misleading and deceptive, to say nothing of its being absolutely

incorrect.

On page 116, under a subheading Political Intelligence, it is

stated, "The FBI practice of supplying political information to the

White House and, on occasion, responding to White House requests

for such information was established oefore 1964. " It is also claimed

that the practice grew to "unprecedented dimensions under Presidents

Johnson and Nixon. "

Observations: We view the use of the terms "practice, "

"political information,

'" and "unprecedented dimensions" as unjustifiably

overemphatic to describe what was at best an incidental, non-

programmed release of information from our files, which information

was basically disseminated by the FBI under the procedures set forth

by the provisions of the Loyalty Program (Executive Order 9845),

succeeded by Executive Order 10450.

While there were a few isolated

instances where the FBI may have volunteered information which could

be labeled as "political, " practically all of the implied abuses claimed

by the SSC were originated by the administration in office and grew at a

rather steady rate from President Eisenhower's administration through

the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. We

therefore view the term "unprecedented dimensions" as self-serving to

those desiring to be critical of the FBI.

On pages 116 and 1l7 appears information under a subheading

Name Check Requests. It is stated that White House aides serving under

Presidents Johnson and Nixon made numerous requests for name checks

of FBI files to elicit "all Bureau information" on certain individuals.

=."

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Observations: The term "all Bureau information" is incorrect

as the FBI's working procedures with the White House stress. only

derogatory information as it relates to name checks.

Book II contains a section entitled "Findings." On page 261,

under Subfinding (e), it is stated that, "It has been the policy of the FBI,

and presumably other agencies as well, to disseminate via name

check reports any information in its files - no matter how old or how

unreliable - which might relate to the standards of the Executive Order. "

(Presumed reference is to Executive Order 10450)

Observations: The phrase, "no matter how old or how

unreliable, " reflects neither FBI policy nor FBI practice in dissemination

of information in Fedcral Employee Security cases. In fact, FBI

dissemination policy as set forth in the FBI Manual of Rules and

Regulations, Part II, Section 5, and referred to in footnotes in Book II

on four separate instances, requires that standards of verification

or reliability be clearly pointed out. These four instances may be found

on pages 2, 3, 4 and 10 of Section 5. On page 4, there is specifically

spelled out the requirement, "in each instance every reasonable effort

should be made to provide additional descriptive information regarding

the source which will enable recipient agencies to intelligently evaluate

the information. " Further, we know of no standards by which we may

establish that information becomes worthless after a certain time.

Instead, it is the relevance of the information and not its age that

governs the dissemination. Finally, the purpose of the Executive Order

involved is to authorize investigations of allegations that the conduct

of Federal employees or applicants does not meet the standards of the

Executive Order. No personnel action is possible without a thorough

investigation of the allegations.

estate. Guidelines incorporated into a Memorandum of Under-

standing (MOU) furnished to Department for Attorney General

(AG) concurrence.

Tentatively, privacy issue as to third

parties to be handled by excising from documents derogatory

information but leaving names in.

Discussion with Steve

Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination, revealed that certain information which FBI

has traditionally included in documents relating to subversive

backgrounds of individuals because FBI considered such information

as derogatory, in a security sense,

is not considered by Blackhurst

as derogatory. Blackhurst was advised that if we are to properly

process

the documents for the King estate it will be necessary

for the Department to furnish a definition of "derogatory."

Blackhurst agreed, intends to confer with other Department

components and Bureau will be further advised.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re:

Martin Luther King, Jr.

100-106670

DETAILS: By way of background, we are presently negotiating

with the Department guidelines

for our implementation of an

AG instruction to furnish to the estate of Martin Luther King,

JI.,

copies of all FBI documents previously given to the Senate Select

committee on Intelligence Activities. A principal element in

negotiations relates to what should and what should not be

excised from the documents prior to delivery to the King estate

(classified information, identities of informants, etc.). Thi

attorneys on behalf of the King estate are Harry Wachtel and

Stanley David Levison who were advisors to King and who are

prominently mentioned in many of the documents involved.

We

have been working with Michael E. Shaheen,

Jx., Special Counsel

Ior Intelligence Goordination, and his assistant, steve Blackhurst,

in arriving at guidelines to be followed in this

project which

consists of our reviewing and processing for delivery about 2

to 22 file cabinet drawers of materials.

On 8/5/76 S. F. Phillips,

INTD, who is coordinating

this matter, hand delivered to Blackhurst a Bureau letter to

the AG ind an accompanying hot by which we intend to formalize

our negotiations and obtain the AG's concurrence with the MoU.

A critical item in the MOU relates to privacy and states that

names of individuals other than'King will not be excised but

any derogatory information about them will be excised.

Phillips

took the occasion of the delivery of the MOU to raise with

Blackhurst possible special considerations concerning Wachtel

and Levison inasmuch as they are mentioned in documents and are

also the King estate attorneys in this matter. Phillips inquired

as to whether their names and information about them should be

treated any differently in the processing of the King documents.

Blackhurst did not think so and discussion ensued as to type

of information concerning Wachtel and Levison appearing in the

documents. Phillips commented that some of the documents will

undoubtedly characterize Wachtel as having been a member of the

National Lawyers Guild, an organization cited as à communist

front by the former House Committee on Un-American Activities.

Blackhurst replied that such information should not be considered

as derogatory. Phillips then referred to the fact that Wachtel's

wife had once been reported to be a member of the Communist

At this point Phillips told Blackhurst that he did

not intend to argue the merits of the position which we have

traditionally taken over the years in our security reporting;

namely, that such information as cited above is included

because it is considered derogatory, in a security sense.

Phillips pointed out that as there is such a wide variance

in understanding as to the meaning of "derogatory," the views

he just expressed versus Blackhurst's expression, it was

believed best that the Department define "derogatory" as it

It was then agreed that the

Department, in responding to our letter to the AG asking for

concurrence with the Mou,

would also furnish the necessary

definition of "derogatory" or other information to guide us

Another matter discussed with Blackhurst and on

which full agreement was reached concerned the fact that some

of the documents will contain material completely extraneous

ADDENDUM: INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

8/9/76

SFP: vb.

The following information resolving the problem discussed

herein was telephonically furnished to SA Phillips by Mr. Blackhurst,

4: 30 p.m., 8/6/76.

Blackhurst discussed the privacy issue problem and the matter

of "derogatory" material with other Departmental officials and, on their advice,

he telephoned Levison. Blackhurst told Levison that, normally, there would

be excised from the documents information which is of a personal nature or

derogatory, and that this would include information as to the personal life

of an individual and also concerning their political associations. It would

include information concerning a person belonging to a "far left" or "far

right"' type organization and Blackhurst used as an example the Ku Klux Klan.

Blackhurst told Levison that some of the documents involved had information

concerning him, as well as concerning Mr. and Mrs. Harry Wachtel, and that

if information of a derogatory nature concerning these three individuals is

to be left in the documents, it would first be necessary for Levison/Wachtel

to furnish the Department a letter to that effect. Levison took the matter under

advisement and then called Blackhurst back and told him that the Department

would receive a letter consenting to have the derogatory information concerning

Levison and the Wachtels left in the documents.

On the basis of the foregoing, Blackhurst advised Phillips that

we could go ahead with our project and to leave the derogatory information

concerning the three individuals in the documents unless it called for excision

for such other reasons as classification or protection of sources. As to all

other third parties, Blackhurst advised that the Bureau could operate on

the basis of its traditional understanding; of the term derogatory. The Bureau

will be furnished a letter from the Department indicating the AG's concurrence

with the MOU and advice concerning; the written consent which the Department

is to receive.

PURPOSE:

To secure approval for expediting the deliveries to

the King estate of FBI commnications by excisina classification

information from them rather than following full

review" procedures.

SYNOPSIS:

We are initiating project in fulfillment of Attorney

General's (AG) instructions to furnish King estate all documents

concerning King previously given to the Senate Select Committee

(SSC). All classified information will be excised.

Large volume

of material involved.

As the AG has instructed expeditious

handling, we will work from material already segregated and

maintained by SENSTUDY 75 Project.

In connection with EO 11652

Classification of National security Information), processing

of material Ior assemination under treedom of Intormation anc

Acts_ (FOI - PA) and other dissemination generally calls

Privac classification review" whereby every original document in

file is assessed for classification on a paragraph-by-paragraph

basis and appropriately marked.

Because of expedite nature and

large volume of material in King estate request, we propose to

merely excise classified information from our copies of the

documents we gave to the SSC, rather than following full

"classification review" procedures.

ACTION:

DETAILS:

As you are aware, we are initiating a project whereby,

worked out with the Department to implement those instructions

include our excising, among other data, all information ot a

classified nature.

Involved as the sse king inquiry was very broad and the Department

desires us to include considerable peripheral material in

responding to the King estate request. The AG has asked that

this endeavor be expedited and that we make deliveries to the

King estate (through the Department) as we complete processing

of various segments of the whole.

In order to readily identify the material we furnished

SENSTUDY 75 Project,

thus be able to bypass the very

time-consuning step of locating the originals of these documents

in our files. The Department is in agreement with our intention

to follow this procedure.

In connection with executive order lost, we

follow the practice when making current dissemination (such addy

under the FOl - PA and other types of dissemination) of

making

a "classification review" of every document. This involves

locating the original docunents in our files and making a

paragraph-by-paragraph assessment as to classification aná

then adding the appropriate markings to the documents in file.

in order to expedite the processing of the voluminous

material Involved for the King estate, we are proposing that

we merely excise the classified information from coples maintained

"classification review,to the SSC, rather than following full

of the documents given

procedures involving original documents.

This writer has personal knowledge that the

information Sullivan fed his superior was

Sullivan told Hoover in 1965 that the

publisher Ralph

McGill said and did certain

dishonorable

things which I know he did not say or do.

My office, as editor of The Constitution

at that time, adjoined McGill's. As close

We were in.

during our 12 years together I never knew

his thinking.

Nothing disturbed us more during that

stressful time of Southern desegregation

than our separate discoveries, discoveries,

I which we immedately shared, that FBI

agents were spying on the personal life of

Dr. Martin Luther King Sr. Our knowledge

i was firsthand. Agents of the Atlanta FBI bu-

reau visited us in our offices and alleged

they had proof of Dr. King's involvement in

extra-marital affairs. In my case an agent,

on two separate visits, insisted strenuously

Hoover was doing. McGill and I traded

disappointed exclamations over this.

Thereafter McGill's columns supported

, Dr. King's leadership of the civil rights,

movement more strongly than ever.

But Sullivan's memo to Hoover claimed

that McGill was so shocked by the FBI's

information on Di. King's private life that

he stated he would use his influence to get

Dr. King out of the leadership of the civil

"""The fact is that" McGill was the only

Atlanta sho stepped forward to co-sponsor.

the banquet, in conjunction with a Catholic

bishop and a Jewish rabbi, while the bank-

ars and businessmen of that city ran for

cover. In conversations

with me. McGill

alternately raged and laughed at the specta-

cle of Atlanta's white establishment being

too timid or too segregated to even send

second vice presidents to the banquet honor-

ing a black Nobel Prize winner.

While Hoover enjoyed Sullivan-inspired

visions of the great liberal newspaper pub-

lisher warning an eager business establish-

ment

away from

the King banquet,

watched McGill work his. way around the

-boycotting businessmen to the holders of

real power in Atlanta, whom he persuaded

to bring their influence and pressure to bear

on the bankers to support the King banquet.

At a vesy. late hour the banquet was saved

from being a lonely gathering of black peo-

ple and a few white humanists by an inpour-

ing of second 'vice presidents,

and even

some firsts, because the word

had been

passed from on high as a result of MeGill's

single-handed exertions.

I had thought the finest irony of that

banquet was the praise Time magazine later

lavished on Atlanta because the shite estab-

fishment had honored & black son, the kind

of national publicity that brought a boom to

That once sleepy town.

But now the senate investigating staff

has discused the true irony: Hoover thought

McGill was trying to sabotage the banquet;

because his agents had told him so.

The implication speaks for itself. An :

autocratic FBI director, armed with the

public's trust and secure from a cowed Con-

- gress, could misuse his power to stalk and

smear any American citizen of his choosing:

including you or me. And probably because

he wanted only good news, he got demon-

strably false intelligence upon which to base

his whims. Frightening?

Consider the footnote: The agent who

- failed to persuade me to smear Dr. King in

The Atlanta Constitution got a harsh Hoover

i letter and an overnight transfer to a distant .

city not long after he failed to come up with

clippings that would have pleased Hoover. I

saw the letter. It said the agent was beint

punished for being six pounds overweight.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Reference is made to my memorandum of December 19,

1975, in which I advised you of a breach of confidentiality

in the handling of FBI documents delivered to the SSC. This

memorandum detailed the disclosure in the North Carolina Press

of former FBI informant George F. Dorsett, which disclosure

was specifically attributed to documents delivered by this

Bureau to the SSC.

On February 6, 1976, the SSC held an Executive Session

concerning 'Domestic Intelligence Investigations." During the

course of the Executive Session several requests were made of

the Bureau personnel present. Among these was a request by

Senator Robert Morgan for a detailed breakdown of payments

made by this Bureau to George F. Dorsett, whom the Senator

alleges to have been a Bureau informant reporting on the

Ku Klux Klan. He also alleged that Dorsett was a "salaried

employee" of the FBI.

George F. Dorsett was an FBI informant fron January,

1959,

to October, 1970.

At no time was he a "salaried employee"

The Attornoy General

Payments to Dorseit commenced January 30, 1959,

and lasted until April 29, 1970.

During this period, he

was paid a total of $26,266.01 which consisted of $16,797.79

for services and $9,468.22 for expenses.

these payments at FBI Headquarters reveals Dorsett was paid

on a "cash-on-delivery" basis, and that these payments were

commensurate with the infornation he furnished.

Dorseit's informant status has not been disclosed

or acknowledged publicly by the FBI. Dorsett hinself has

persistently denied in public, his former role as a Bureau

informant. During an interview of Dorsett by FBI Agents on

December 12, 1975, he expressed concern for his personal

safety and

for the saiety of his family, based on newspaper

articles which alleged his informant status. If information

regarding payments to Dorsett becomes available to the news

media, it would confirm his informant status and further

jeopardize his safety.

Based on a previous agreement with SSC Staff

personnel, the FßI has not been required to divulge the

identity of any individual who served in an informant

status with this Bureau. In view of the above, the Bureau

feels it cannot respond to Senator Morgan's request, and

is forwarding a nemorandum to the SSC explaining this

position.

The Bureau's reluctance in giving this information

is based on the need to protect the safety and well being

of those who have volunteered their services to assist

their country and the FBI.

Reference is made to a request by Senator Robert

Morgan at an Ixecutive Session of the SSE on February 6, 1976.

On February 6, 1976, the SSC held an Executive Session

concerning "Domestic Intelligence Investigations." During the

course of the Executive Session, several requests were made

of the Bureau personnel present.

Anong

these was a request by

Senator Morgan for all information concerning payments made by

this Bureau to one George F. Dorsett, whom Senator Morgan

alleges to have been a Bureau informant. Based on a previous

agreement with SSC Staff personnel, the

FBI has not been

required to divulge the identity of individuals who have not

been publicly acknowledged as informants.

The FBI has made no public statement as to whether or

not Dorsett acted as an informant of this Bureau, and Dorsett

has, himself, publicly denied ever serving in an informant

capacity. In view of the above agreement, this Bureau feels it

MONTGOMERY a considerable amount of information.

MONTGOMERY told FRIEDMAN that this was not true, that he

received his information from the Sheriff's Office in Alameda

County.

FRIEDMAN also indicated that MONTGOMERY had received

information concerning ANGELA DAVIS and the guns used in

the Marin County shootout in which several people were •

killed. MONIGOMERY told FRIEDMAN that this was not true,

that he had received this information from the Marin County

Sheriff's Office and that the FBI was not involved in this

case at that point but did later have an unlawful flight

warrant on DAVIS, which resulted in her eventual arrest in

New York!

FRIEDMAN referred to several

the Church Committee Report and indicated it was obvious to

him that the FBI had furnished the information to MONTGOMERY.

MONTGOMERY told him this was "a lot of garbage."

MONTGOMERY

then asked FRIEDMAN if MONTGOMERY's name was mentioned in

the report as having received the information and FRIEDMAN

said it was not although FRIEDMAN drew the conclusion that

it was MONTGOMERY.

prepare appropriate communication to the U. S. Senate pro-

testing activities of Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff

member Arthur Jefferson who has involved himself on the

side of Black Panther Party (BPP) subjects against the FBI

in legal proceedings in Los Angeles and Chicago.

SYNOPSIS: In a state court case in Los Angeles, Califomia,

Involving Taylor, a former BPP member on trial for attempted

murder of a policeman in 1971, the defense has tried to

establish that the FBI's Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO)

harassed the defendant and caused him to commit the crime.

In its latest action the defense has subpoenaed 65 documents

from our Los Angeles and San Diego offices.

Review of these

documents indicate they are all COINTELPRO

related and subject

Taylor is not mentioned.

Los Angeles and San Diego recommended

and FBIHQ concurs that these documents should not be produced

and

the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) in Los Angeles

and the Department of Justice in Washington, D. G., are being

Hearing is set for approximately

testimony of Arthur Jefferson, reportedly an employee or in-

vestigator of the SSC who allegedly authored SSC report on

Est tarassment of Bre, particularly in California.

sSc final

report dated 4/28/76,

confirms Jefferson's connection with the

SSC.

In addition, Jefferson is listed as witness

for the

plaintiffs in the Iberia Hampton civil suit in Chicago and our

COINTELPRO efforts against the BPP have also been interjected

into this suit.

Since Jefferson is apparently using information

obtained through his SSC work, an appropriate

communication

should be sent to the U. S. Senate protesting

his actions.

Harold Taylor is one of three Los Angeles BPP

members on trial in the Superior Court in California for

Etempted murder of a policeman on 9/10/71

rial the defense has attempted to establish that the FBI'

COINTELPRO harassed the defendants and caused then to

commit the crime.

On 5/24/76 Los Angeles advised that the defense

attorney in this case, Beth Lizsey has subpoenaed, and is

introducing the oral testimony of Arthur Jefferson. Jerferson

qualified as an expert witness on the basis of being an

investigator or employee of the SSC and reportedly authored

the Committee's report about alleged FBI harassment and

Illegal activities against the BPP, particularly in California.

According to the prosecutor in the case, Jefferson's testimony

to date has been before the jury.

On 5/25/76 Los Angeles advised that a subpoena

San Diego office. These documents were specifically identified

according to date and whether they were prepared at FBIHQ or

The subpoena states the documents are material

to the issue

involved and relevant to the defense of Taylor,

a member of the BPP.

In its review of the list of documents Los Angeles

was able to identify 21 of the 25, all of which relate to the

BPP COINTELPRO file. The documents are of general nature

pertaining to the disruptive tactics against the BPP and none

mentioned Taylor. Similarly, San Diego determined all

communications located which were named in the subpoena

were in its COINTELPRO file and none contained any reference

to Taylor.

Los Angeles and San Diego recommended documents

not be made available to the defense and the Intelligence

Division and Legal Counsel Division concur. AUSA Dominick

Rubalcava, Los Angeles is handling this matter but to date

has been unsuccessful in contacting Departmental Attorney

Gordon Daiger, Washington, D. C., for his opinion regarding

production of

the documents.

Rubalcava stated he is making

no recommendations at this time pending discussions with

Daiger, but feels documents subpoenaed should not be made

available unless the entire trial would be jeopardized.

Rubalcava believes court appearances pertaining to production

of documents will not be scheduled until approximately 6/1/76.

He advised the defense counsel is utilizing expert testimony

of Arthur Jefferson who is testifying concerning FBI actions

undertaken nationwide to disrupt BPP activity.

On 5/26/76 Mr. R. F. Peterson of the Legal Counsel

Division contacted Daiger who stated he has not been in

contact with Rubalcava concerning the matter. Pending dis-

cussion with Rubalcava, Daiger will render an opinion

regarding production of the documents.

You and I met this morning with the Attorney General,.

Mike. Shaheen, Steve Blackhurst, and Senator Morgan of North

Carolina and his assistant, WalteryRicks.

'1!:

Senator Morgan was desirous of receiving the approval of

Mr. Levi for public release of certain documents concerning FBI

investigations of the Klan in North Carolina. These documents pertain

to efforts of an informant to charter a number of chapters after breaking

away from the main Klan organization, and would in all probability pin-

point the identity of the informant. The Senator also wanted certain

documents concerning Cointelpro activity against the Black Panthers

in North Carolina cleared for public release.

After much discussion, the Attorney General voiced..

his great reluctance to in any way reveal the identity of an informant

even though the informant had publicly been identified by Senator Morgan

in speeches. Mr. Levi reminded the Senator of the procedures followed

by the Senate Committee and the agreement not to reveal informant

identities. Senator Morgan was unhappy with this position and feels that Th

North Carolina is being unfairly labeled by the FBI as the Klan capital

of the world when, in fact, much of the Klan activity and violence can be

attributed, according to Senator Morgan, to FBI informant activity. His

interest in releasing these documents stems somewhat from the fact that

Statements he has made chainine by khan Te so alt gis he a H68

that many letters critical of him had been written by ex-Agents, which he

suspects may have been motivated by the Special Agent in Charge. He

stated these letter's do not bother him, since they give him the opportunity

to strike back.

Re:

which the Bureau is involved, including the Socialist

Workers Party suit which recently necessitated the

Xeroxing of thousands of pages on an expedite basis.

The transfer of the Document Classification Office and

its related activities from the Inspection Division to

the Intelligence Division will add to the volume of work

being placed upon these machines. An increase in the

Freedom of Information Act requests and appeals also

creates additional need for reproduction of documents.

Although it is impossible to determine with

any certainty the amount of documents which now need to

volume can be predicted.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Mr. Levi:

HATE DISHES REAL/Pr

I would like to thank you for the courtesy you extended

by promptly responding to my request to see you.

Your action

exemplified the spirit of cooperation between the Executive

and Congress which prompted my request.

I do feel that my concern that the FBI clear for release

the documents with which I was concerned deserves your seri-

ous attention.

While I am aware that the release of the docu-

ments may confirm the identity of a former FBI informant, I

feel the posture the Bureau has taken in publicly denying that

the events described in the documents ever took place neces-

sitates their release, if only to set the record straight. It

should be noted that the Bureau's public position in this situ-

ation,

as well as in others, has been taken in direct response

to public statements I have made critical of past improper FBI

activities.

FBI activity, instead of it is the confirmation of improper

the identity of the informant, wed

which I am concerned. Further, it is my feeling that,

on information I have received, the identity of the intormant

is already common knowledge..

The other group of documents for which I sought release

concern FBI actions taken against the Black Panther Party in

North Carolina.

and I anticipate no problems with their clearance.

Under sep-

arate cover I am furnishing Mr. Steve Blackhurst copies of the

documents for which I seek clearance.

Again, let me express my appreciation to you for your as-

sistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

Morgan wishes to have

cleared for public release.

Reference is also made to

Senator Morgan's letter to Attorney General Levi dated

May 11, 1975, pertaining to these same documents.

The requested clearance for release is not

being granted.

It appears this request is a personal

request of Senator Morgan and not related to SSC

business.

The SSC has conducted a thorough review

of FBI Counterintelligence Program activities relating both

to white hate and black hate groups and individuals.

The

SSC has held public hearings, issued public statements,

and prepared and released its reports covering these areas.

It is felt that the FBI should not agree to any further

public release of documents in this area and that specifically

no such release should be approved for any request that is

not that of the SSG for SSG purposes.

Senator Morgan states in his letter to the

improper FBI activity.

Your attention is invited to the

Senator Morgan in his referenced letter states

regarding the possible disclosure of the identity of an

informant that it is his understanding

identity is "already coumon knowledge, that this informant's

This informant's

public identification is based solely on unauthorized

disclosures that have

been made in the North Carolina

press attributed

to unnamed sources on the SSG and to

Senator Morgan.

For the FBI to accede to the public

release of these documents would serve only to support

the prior unauthorized disclosures of the identicy or

a confidential informant. It is emphasized that the

disclosure of this or any FBI confidential source or

confidential informant is considered a most serious breach of

confidentiality.

. - The Attorney General

NOTE:

U. S. Senator Robert Morgan of North Carolina, member

of the SSG,

has publicly criticized the FBI for its Counterintelli

gence Program (COINTELPRO) actions directed against the klan and

the Black Panther Party, (BPP) in North Carolina.

Some documents

that were provided to the ssc, and relating to this area,lead to

the identity of a former klan

informant.

This informant has been

identified in the North Carolina press attributed to the sse

and by Senator Morgan.

On May 10, 1976, Senator Morgan and the

Attorney General, with respective assistants, and Associate

Director N. P. Callahan and Beputy Associate Director J. B.

Adams met.

At that time Senator Morgan expressed his desire

to have documents released publicly which allegedly support

his contention that the FBI has conducted itself improperly in

Its investigation of the klan, particularly in North Carolina.

The Attorney General stated his reluctance to reveal in any way

the identity of a confidential informant.

The Attorney General

did advise Senator Morgan that we would review the documents and

the Attorney General would inform Senator Morgan of his decision

regarding their release.

Senator Morgan has requested of the

Attorney General that we grant approval for public release of

documents allegedly supporting Senator Morgan's allegations of

FBI misconduct.

These documents include those that identity this

informant.

We are recommending to the Attorney General that the re

quest be denied inasmuch as it appears to be a personal request

of Senator Morgan and not a request of the SSC and that the SSC

has prepared and released its report on COINTELPRO activities
