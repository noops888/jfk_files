The FBI did not open a kidnapping case on the
Jobn Paisley matter, although the FBI considered his
disappearance as a possible violation of the Federal
Kidnapping Statute, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1261(b).
Information was received on a possible violation on
September 29, 1978, from Valter Taylor, National Editor
of "The Washington Star," who advised that shortly after
&:00 a.m. Assistant Editor Kenneth Eichenberry (phonetic)
received a telephone call from an individual who identified
hinself as Ghawzi Ullah, stating that they had kidnapped a
Central Intelligence Agency (GIA) employee named John
Taysle (phonetic). At-approzimately 10:00 a.m., Mr. Taylor

’ received a second telephone call from Ghawzi Ullah stating

that John Paisley, a CIA agent, had been seized by one of
their commandos in the Chesapeake Bay area. He stated that
Paisley was valuable to them for identification of "Zionist
Agents” in other. countries. Ghawzi Ullah made the following
demands for the "tiuslim Council of War of lew York": (0)

1. the release of all Muslim prisoners;
2. §$1,000,000.00 and;

3, that Henry Kissinger be turned over to them. (U) _

He stated that the specifie time and date would
be called in later and that he wanted this action to be
published and widely circulated. He further stated that
this was no joke; that it was not a game; and that it
affected the fate of "Islam." (U)

It should be noted that "The Washington Post”
on Friday, September 29, 1975, Page 51, contained an
article corcerning Paisley and his disappearance and that
he ter oye off his sloop somewhere in the Chesapeake
Bay. :

: Paisley's bedy was lecated in the Chesapeake Bay
on October 1, 1978. In view of the evidence not supporting
an actual kidnapping nor the crossing of a state line, the
FBI conducted no further investigation into this viclation

' of the Federal Kidnapping Statute. (UV)

SUBJECT: CONSOLIDATION AND PURGE
CIVIL FINGERPRINT FILE
ENTLFICATION DIVISION

: Purpose of this memorandum is to revise policy for the consolidation ar
* purging of the civil fingerprint file. ;

: The civil fingerprint file is housed on the third floor of the Identi-~,
n Building and consists of more than 136, 00),.000 fingervrint cards occupying
nately 47,000 square feet of floor space. The file is broken cown into 5
principal sections, Military (43, 000,000), Civil Service (19,000,000), Alien (14, 060, q
Nation nal Defense and Miscellaneous Applicants (54, 000, 000), and Personal identifica-
tion (8, 000,000). As personnel have been available in the past we have, of a limite:
basis, consolidated and purged the file. For example, we have been microfilming anc
destroying prints in the National Army Section of the Military file (World V, Cne
prints not filed by classification), which contains 4,260,000 prints. This project is
about 66% complete, Further, the Prisonér of War file, which contained a
358,735 prin 35 was recently destroyed with Archival approval. We have also
purging the National Defense section of the file of persons 75 years of age and ol
-This purge was conducted with approval of the Director and approximately 5, 413, 860
of these prints have been tabbed for destruction. As a regular procedure we have ion!
microfilmed and Cestroyed deceased prints (both civil and criminal) aiter 10 years
from date of death, :

PROPOSALS: The Bureau's budge request for fiscal year 1972 contains 274 em-
ployees earmarked for consolidation of the civil file and, if this requesi-is approved,
we intend to proceed with the following policy for implementation of this project:

1, The National Defense portion of the file contains the fingerprints
individuals taken in connection with civilian national defense work during World War
Two and comprises almost one-third of our entire civil file (45 million), In 1957 the
Bureau, in arder to retard the growth of the civil file, established a policy of not re-
taining new prints ee in this category, i.e., non-Federal applicants, Thus,
no adaitior nal near have een added to the file since 1957. We propose to destroy thi]
file as well as the 2 licable to it. The prints were submitied i

ietermine W hother or not the indi nis had arrest records in order the

ese prints would be to
¢ m or missing person cases,
Serre he 2S shown that paren in this file is practically nonexistent, Authorit
to proceed with this proposal rests with the Bureau.

2, We propose to destroy the fingerprint cards of all individuals in the
remaining sections of the civil file who are 75 years of age and older. Activity in
this section of the civil file is practicaily nil. In order to proceed with this propos}
we would need the concurrence of the agencies involved, such.as Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) for alien prints, Civil Service Commission (CSC) for
Civil Sezvice prints, and branches of the military for military prints. We would
also need Archival approval. 7

3.. We propose ‘that the remaining fingerprints in the civil file be consol
idated and in those instances where more than one fingerprint card is found-on the
same individual that only one card be retained and thé remaining cards destroyed..
A record of the prints destroyed would be retained in our Card index Section for
future reference. The consolidated index card’ would show dates taken and sources
of duplicate prints destroyed. if this procedure is adopted, we will have on file at
least one fingerprint card for each individual represented in our civil file. In orde:
to proceed with this proposal we will need concurrence from the agencies involved,
including INS, CSC, and the branches of the military as well as Archival appr roval.

stn cercarmat int HOON tt RERUN A ORIEL EEN

If these proposals are adopted and personnel provided to carry them out,
upon compietion of the consolidation and ourging project we would destroy at least
67,000, 090 civil fingerprint cards which “would result i ia the savings of more than
23,590 square feet of floor space or approximately 50% of the civil file and space
it now occuwies. We estimate completion of the project in 10 years, or an average
saving of 2350 square feet of floor space pzv year. In addition to the savings in flo
space, benefits would be realized from savings in searching and locate time. The
274 employees requested in the fiscal year 1972 budget earmarked for the civil file
consolidation project do not involve the criminal file. However, we are also con-
sidering proposed policy for limited purging of the criminal file anda separate
memorandum will be submitted forward on Mitte

That our ‘Proposed pres dures for consolida ation and purging
proved ard we be elle to proceed to contact the other
agencies to obtain their concurrence, ad 7

: 4 +
: On 1-13-71 the Executives Conference consisting of Messrs. Tolson,
Mohr, Sullivan, Bishop, Brennan, Adams for Callahan, Casper,.Conrad, Felt, Gale,
Rosen, Tavel, McDaniel for Walters, and Soyars considered the following matter,

BACKGROU The civil fingerprint file is housed on the third floor of the Identi-
fication Building and consists of more than 186, 000,000 fingerprint cards occ
approximately 47,000 square feet of floor space. The file is broken down ir
principal sections, Military (48, 000, 000), Civil Service (19, 000, 900), Alien |

_ tion (6, 000,000), As

rsonnel have been available in the past we have, | ona
basis, consolidated

purg ged the file. For ee we have been micr

prints not filed oy classification), which contains 4, 250, 000 prints. This
about -68% complete. Further, the Prisoner of War file, which con
358,735 prints, was recently destroyed with Archival approval. With the
approval, we have been purging the National Defense section of the jile of
years of age and older, and approximately 5, 413, 890 of these prints have 1
for'destruction, As a regular procedure we have long microfilmed and destroy
‘ceased prints’ (both civil and criminal) after 10 years from sate of death.

PROPOSALS: The Bureau's budget request for fiscal oe 1972 contains 274 em-
|, ployees earmarked for consolidation of the civil file and, if this request is approved,
“we intend to proceed with the ioliowing policy for implementation of this projec! t:

1. The National Defens portion of the file Co outing of indi- —

viduals taken in connétiion wit dl
and comprises almost one-third of our entire Civil file’ (a3 ‘miltion).
to retard the growth of the civil file, establishéd a policy of not retain
submitted in this category, i.e., non-Federal applicants. Thus, no add:
have been added to the file since 1957. We propose to destroy this file and the

would be

’ The prints were submitted initially to determine whether or :.:.

would need the concurrence of the agencies involved, such as Immigration and Natt
zation Service (INS) for alien prints, Civil Service Commission (CSC) for Civil S
prints, and branches of the militaryfor military prints. We would also need Archiy
approval. The majority of the Conference, consisting of Messrs. Tolson, Rosen, G
Brennan, Sullivan, Soyars, Tavel and McDaniel, avreed with this proposal. Th i
nority, consisting of Messrs. Mohr, Adams, Bishop, Casper, Felt and Conrad,
of the opinion that the age limit should be 80 rather than 75,

of the inte déstroyed would be réfained in our Card Index Section for” future
The consolidated index card would show dates taken and sources of duplicate pr
destroyed. If this procedure is adopted, we will have on file at least one
card for each individual represented in our civil file. In order to proceed w
proposal we will need concurrence from the agencies involved, including INS, CSC, 2:
the branches of the military as well as Archival approval. Conference unanimously
_fagreed with this proposal. 7

upon completion of the project we would destroy at least, 67,000, 000 civil fingerp
; cards which would result in the savings of more than 23, 500 square feet of floor
or approximately 50% of the civil file and space it now occypies. We estimate com
tion of the project in 10 years, or an average saving of 2,350 square feet of floor 3
per year. In addition to the savings in floor space, venefits would be realized from
savings in search and locate time. If the proposals are approved, the Identification
Division will proceed to contact the other agencies to obtain their concurrence.

Dear J

In connection with our continuing inquiry into the
John Paisley matter, there is some additional information
which I would appreciate your making available to us.

1. In view of the questions which have been raised by
Mrs. Paisley concerning the identification of her husband's
body, we would like to have copies of all the fingerprint
ecards and fingerprint registration cards which were located,
examined and/or prepared in connection with the Bureau's
recent Paisley fingerprint identification work, including, --~
of course, the final report which was prepared on this {
subject for the Maryland State Police. In addition, it ‘_
would be helpful for us to have copies of all the relevant
materials relating to any FBI policies or practices which
may have accounted for the purging from FBI files of the
John Paisley prints which had been submitted at the time
of Mr. Paisley's application for employment by the CIA.

2. We have been informed by officials of the CIA that
on September 29, 1978, they were informed that "the FBI
opened a kidnapping case" in connection with this matter.

If this information is accurate, I would appreciate your .
providing us with copies of any materials which reflect the
predicate and authorization for initiating that inquiry,
together with whatever information was developed as a result.

3. We have also beén informed by the CIA that on
September 28, 1978, the Agency informed the Bureau by
memorandum that a Coast Guard setat had advised oe that

been developed by your Bureau with respect to these two
allegations would also be helpful.

Your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Judge Webster:

As you know, the oars Select Committee, on..Lntellicen
ence is engaged in a study of the Buréau's role in
combatting terrorism. To aid the Committee in this study,
it would be beneficial if designated Committee staff were
provided with the following:

(1) A visit to the FBI's Chicago field office in
order to interview those Special Agents responsible for
the peaceful resolution of the recent attempted take-
over of the German consulate by Croatian terrorists. a
understand that the FBI response to this terrorist inl
dent is illustrative of the coordination the FBI has’ wi
zy both the State Department and local law enforcement a

(2) An oral briefing describing the FBI er re
for a terrorist kidnapping in the United States comparable
to that which occurred in the Moro case in Italy.

Thomas Crowley and Keith Raffel, who hold full sensi-
tive clearances, have been assigned to pursue the above
concerns. On behalf of the Committee, I again thank you

consider BARAHENI to be an Agent of SAVAK. SF indices
negative on DARTA BAKHTIARIHA. Record checks at Berkeley,
California, determined BAKHTIARIHA was a student at
Armstrong College from 1/72 to 2/76.  BAKHTIARIHA was
murdered on 2/20/76, in Oakland, California, at 4:25 a.m.
while being robbed by two men who had moments before
murdered another individual and wounded a third in the
course of a robbery and burglary. The responsibles were
identified, arrested and convicted for these offenses.

A representative of, tthe ISA advised BAKHTIARIHA was not a

The following investigation was conducted at
San Jose, California, by SA JOHN W. ZENT, JR.:

An Offense Report was made available by the

“San Jose State University (SJSU) Police Department
concerning a demonstration that took place at SJSU on
March 16, 1976, wherein the ISA, San Jose, California,
disrupted a public forum presented by the Committee for
Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran (CAIFI).
leaflet published under the letterhead of the ISA,.
Northern California, entitled "Who is REZA BARAHENI?, a
Traitor", was also furnished. The public forum had
scheduled prominent speakers, including DANIEL ELLSBERG,
JESSICA MITFORD, KAY BOYLE and Dr. REZA BARAHENI. The ISA
protested the presence of REZA BARAHENI, who.claims to be
an Iranian National and a former political prisoner in
Iran. The ISA claimed BARAHENI is actually an Agent of
SAVAK, the Iranian Secret Police. { :

The report indicates that some 200 to 250 Iranian
students disrupted the public forum with chanting and
shouting, as well as destruction of CAIFI literature. The
SJSU Police Department advised the representatives of CAIFI
and BARAHENI beforehand that they had received an indication
of this planned demonstration and advised BARAHENI that
some threats against his personal safety had been rumored.
Based upon this, BARAHENI declined to appear at the forum,
but the ISA demonstrators remained and shouted over the
voices of the other speakers who gave their addresses as
scheduled. The basis of the Police Department's concern
was previous ISA demonstrations at various locations
throughout the United States where BARAHENI has spoken in
the past. Other demonstrations and disruptions occurred on
January 9, 1975, at the University of California at Berkeley
(UCB), at Boston, Massachusetts, on February 27, 1975, and at
Austin, Texas, on February 5, 1976.

The SJSU Police Department, in an effort to
prevent any hostilities at the forum, made’ an effort to
contact ‘representatives of the ISA; namely, the President of

the ISA National Organization, ISA - USA (see Appendix) at
SJSU, MOHAMMAD TAHER, who accused them of police harassment
and was extremely hostile and refused to discuss the
demonstration. [4

The above-mentioned leaflet challenged the
legitimacy of BARAHENI being "freed from prison", and
alleged that he appeared on the Iranian National television,
a state controlled media, and subsequently attacked all
progressive movements and revolutionary. leaders of the

Iranian people and praised the regime,’of the Shah of Iran. }/

; The following investigation was conducted at
Berkeley, California, by SA V. STEWART DALEY: ({j.

: A search of the records of the Berkeley Police
Department on April 13, 1977, located a offense report

dated 11/12/75, which reported\the theft of a license plate
from the automobile of DARIA B.\BAKHTIARIHA, which revealed
him to be a student at Armstrong\College, Berkeley, California,
who is a citizen of Iran, born July 5, 1950, who resides at
1290 Apartment 39, Hopkins Street, Berkeley, California. 4

It was determined from Armstrong College, Berkeley,
California, on April 13, 1977, that DARIA B. BAKHTIARIHA was.
an Undergraduate Student at that institution, studying
Accounting and Business Administration from January, 1972, until
February, 1976, when he failed to attend further classes. u

On April 14, 1977, a copy ef a California driver's
license .in the name of DARIA BAKHTIAR ‘BAKHTIARIHA, with the
address of 2535 College. '309, Berkeley, California.

-On April 14, 1977, it was determined from the
: management of the apartment building at 1290 Hopkins Street,
: Berkeley, California, that DARIA BAKHTIARIHA had been a
tenant at that location up until early 1976, when he was killed
7 in Oakland, California, during the commission of a robbery or

At 4:25 a.m. on February 20, 1976, DARIA BAKHTIARIHA
was exiting his automobile in the 6300 block of Racine Street,
Oakland, California. Moments before, two unknown Subjects
forced their entry into the bathroom window of a groundfloor
apartment at 540 Alcatraz Street, Oaklarid, ‘California, which
is around the. corner from the location of BAKHTIARIHA's car,
and a total of two blocks away. Upon gaining entry to the
apartment, the responsibles bound the neck, hands and feet of
the occupant of the apartment, PETER LEE KENFIELD, and tied a
pillowcase over his head. The result was that KENFIELD died
of asphyxiation. The responsibles ransacked his apartment,
and as was later determined from friends of KENFIELD's, removed
a calculator and .22 caliber pistol from KENFIELD's belongings.
The two reponsibles then moved to the apartment next door,
where they attempted to force entry, but were denied at the
front door by the occupant, RAYMOND STEWART, whom they wounded
in the leg by firing four bullets through the front door with
KENFIELD's pistol. The two then exited the apartment building,
and en route to their residence, approximately three blocks away,
came directly in contact with BAKHTIARIHA, who was exiting his
car at that time. They approached BAKHTIARIHA, robbed him at
gunpoint, and shot him in the stomach and back. BAKHTIARIHA
then staggered to the intersection of, Racine and Alcatraz Street,
where he collapsed on the sidewalk. A resident, who was first
on the scene, was told by BAKHTIARIHA that he had been robbed
and shot by two Negro males. BAKHTIARIHA died at a nearby
hospital shortly after his arrival.

A crime~scene search located a thumbprint on the
bathroom window at the point of entry. Subsequent investigation
determined the ‘identity of the missing calculator and pistol and
dissemination of this information to the patrol officers and
burglary unit resulted in the matching of KENFIELD's calculator
to a calculator recovered in connection with an investigation of
a burglary on February 24, 1976, at 685 63rd Street, Oakland,
California, which is two blocks away from the site of KENFIELD's
aka BAKHTIARIHA's murder. Arrested for this burglary was JOHN.
M.\HARTWAY, JR., Negro male, born January 27, 1954, and an
“acdéomplice. HARTWAY's fingerprints matched-with the print ~
recovered at KENFIELD's apartment. A trace of the recovered
calculator found in HARTWAY's possession from its time of at
manufacture, verified that it was purchased by KENFIELD. The be

bullets recovered from BAKHTIARIHA's body were found to be
‘identical to the bullets fired through the door of STEWART's
apartment. The revolver was never recovered. ‘

JOHN HARTWAY was convicted by a jury in the Superior

Court of the State of California, the County of Alameda, on
August 16, 1976, for one count of Murder-in the First Degree,
two counts of Burglary in the First Degree, one count of
Robbery in the First Degree, and one count of Assault with a.
Deadly Weapon in the first degree. A prior conviction was
dismissed and a motion for a new trial was denied, as was a
motion for probation. HARTWAY was sentenced on September 14,
1976, to serve consecutive sentences for his convictions on
burglary, robbery and assault, with those sentences to run
concurrently with the sentence imposed for murder. He was
delivered to the custody of the Sheriff of Alameda County

i for transmittal to the California Medical Facility, Vacaville,

California, from where he will be further transported to a

state prison. iA :

It was determined from Sergeant LEW MACE, Oakland
Police Department, the investigating officer,’ that it was the
decision of the prosecuting attorney not to prosecute HARTWAY.
for the robbery and murder of BAKHTIARIHA because of his
confidence that their case against HARTWAY for the murder of
KENFIELD was sufficient for conviction, and because without
the gun used to kill BAKHTIARIHA, their case against HARTWAY
for that murder was circumstantial, although strongly S0-¢A_

On April 19, 1977, MAHMOUD KHOSSOUSSI, 1290 Hopkins
Street, Apartment 39, Berkeley, California, a known leader of 4
the Nationalist faction of the ISA in Northern California,
Subject of SF 105-40750, was contacted and advised as follows: l\

He moved in to his apartment after BAKHTIARIHA was
killed and did not know him personally, but does know that
BAKHTIARIHA was never a member of the ISA.[\

IRANIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION CISA)
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE cee caida
INTERNAL SECURITY - IRAN

The Iranian Students Association (ISA) in the ~

United States is described in its’ own literature as a member :
of the World Confederation of Iranian Students (WCIS). Poet
Founded in 1958, WCIS is a student federation active in the
United States, Europe, Turkey and the USSR. It is dedicated
to the defense of Iranian "political prisoners" and opposed ..
to the Government of the Shah of Iran. WCIS is governed by the
communist concept of "democratic centralism" and supports the

- National Front, and Iranian political party opposed to the
Shah's government.

: Dué to a severe factionalism, the ISA is devided
into two main factions: . the (Marxist) Communist and National
Front factions. ;

The (Marxist) Communist faction is opposed to armed
struggle and guerrilla-activity at the present stage. They
cling to the orthodox Marxist view that the revolutionary
consciousness of the peasants and workers must be raised
before the revolution can succeed. They insist the only way
to revolution is to follow the teachings of Marx, Lenin and
MAO Tse-tung. They want to build alliances with revolutionary
groups of other nations to present a broad united front against
imperialism.

The National Front faction takes the position of
the necessity of guerrilla warfare and terrorism as the first
phase of the anti-imperialist revolution and calls for this
type action now. The National Front rejects the concept of-
an international alliance of révolutionaries, arguing. that’ |
their goal is revolution in Iran and the revolution is to be
uniquely Iranian.

The ISA, with chapters located at various campuses
in the United States, is composed generally of Iranian aliens
who have been admitted to the United States as students. They
are united in their denunciation of the Shah of Iran as a
puppet of United States imperialism. Activities in the
United States are primarily confined to demonstrations against
the Shah of Iran and "United States Inperialism."' Members
of the ISA have also attached Iranian diplomats and Iranian

facilities in the United States. 7

HERMAN H. FELLER, 3111 Brighton First Place,
Brooklyn, New York (NY) furnished the following information:

He is the President of Peller Chemical Corporation,
Rodex International, Ltd., Shock-M-All Incorporated
and Ultrason International. All of thesé -firms are
located in a one-room office on the ground floor in
a resident apartment complex at 220 West Merrick Road,
Valley Stream, NY (telephone number (516) 825-2424).
He also maintains post office box 272, Valley Stream,
in the name of ence Stan Incorporated.

Peller Chemical ‘Company which dealt primarily
in insecticides is a dormant organization, -because ©
Mr. FELLER is devoting his full time to marketing a
device which is attached to the baseboard of a room
and electricutes cockroachs and other crawling insects
which crawl into the device._ Mr. FELLER demonstrates A
this device by attaching it to the inside of a display : 4
box. Into the box, Mr. FELLER places live roaches ray
which he breeds in his office for this purpose. H |

Pad . ME. FELLER has patented this device and is
attempting to develop distributors for it, but to date,

repeller. Mr. FELLER explained that this machine
| chases rats and other rodents by use of an ultrasonic
| sound. The rodents attempt to find a new area to colonize,

NY 97-2755 i

Mr. FELLER explained that he is frequently

alone in his office as his only employee, who

does clerical work and works only part time, usually works
i three days a week, u ae

On one such occasion, at approximately 1:45
in the afternoon about two weeks ago, two men entéred
the office and announced they were there to ask some
questions. Mr. FELLER asked them to identify themselves.
They ignored this request and stated that they had
some questions concerning NASSAR AFSHAR,. an Iranian

residing in the Washington, D.C. area, who was an acquaintance

of FELLER’s. : :
: Mr. FELLER told these men that if they wanted
information concerning AFSHAR;, they should ask AFSHAR.

Mr. FELLER described one of these men (referred

to as unman #1) as about 5 feet 6 inches tall, 150
pounds, stocky, muscular build. The other man (referred
to as unman $2), is 5 feet 10 inches tall, 150 pounds,
slender build. .They both appeared to be in their 40's.
Although they did not resemble AFSHAR, they did possess

|. some of the same general characteristics and therefore,

|! Mr. FELLER assumed they were Iranians. AFSHAR is the
only other Iranian Mr. FELLER ever met.

” Unman #2 seemed to be in charge.

When Mr. FELLER declined to answer their
questions, they then assumed a threatening attitude.
At this point, Mr. FELLER explained to the men that
his office was equipped with a burglar alarm system which
was connected with the Valley Stream Police Department
and the police would respond immediately to the alarm
and probably shoot the two men if they caused
any trouble. Mr. FELLER also stated that he could
use his telephone to communicate directly with Nassau
County Police Department cars, which might be in the
area.

- Unman $1 had some kind of a "tool with three
pins" in his hand with which he hit Mr. FELLER on the
right shoulder, breaking his skin in three places. Z
Mr. FELLER, in turn, picked-up a Shock-M-All transformer
(a metal box approximately 2 inches by 3 inches, weighing

one and three-fourths pounds) , nd hit unman #1 on
the forehead, causing profuse bleeding. Mr. FELLER
told the men to get out of his ffice or he would call
the police.

At this point, unman $2 assumed a more peaceful
attitude and tried to quiet Mr.{FELLER and unman #1.
He asked permission to make a collect telephone call
which Mr. FELLER agreed to. Hejspoke in a foreign
language to an individual unknown to Mr. FELLER for,
a few seconds and then handed the telephone to Mr.
FELLER. The man at the other end of the line,.who-
spoke excellent English, did not give his name, but
told Mr. FELLER that he was from the Iranian Enbassy.
He apologetically explained thet a mistake had been
made and the two men had no. right to be there. He
asked Mr. FELLER to please excuse their actions to
which Mr. FELLER replied that 4 would press charges
against them. He gave the telephone back to unman #2.
After saying a few words, he hung up and told Mr. FELLER
that they would leave immediately and offered to pay
cash for any damages they may hdve caused. Mr. FELLER ‘
told them to get out of his whe.

Mr. FELLER did not push the alarm button
nor did he communicate with any, ipolice agency in any
way.

’ Mr. FELLER explained that he first met NASSAR
AFSHAR in 1955 or 1956, when he ! (AFSHAR) was in the

State Building, New York City. Mr. FELLER was instrumental
‘in arranging for AFSHAR to meet certain people and

to arrange for a contract between these people and the.
government of Iran in some sort of deal pertaining -
to the exporting of over 40,000,000 barrels of oil

over a three year period. AFSHAR received a commission

on this contract. Mr. FELLER and AFSHAR have recently

: 1 : :
‘ "After these two unknown men left Mr. FELLER's
office, he called AFSHAR on his private telephone in
Washington, D.C. and advised him of the above incident.
They speculated as to how the two men could have connected
Mr. FELLER with AFSHAR and concluded that AFSHAR's
phone was probably tapped and their conversations had
been- overheard.

Mr. AFSHAR said that on June 17, 1977, SELLER:
telephonically advised him that on Tuesday, June 14, 1977,
two men came to his office and inquired if he was ‘acquainted
with AFSHAR. SELLER replied that he was and they immediately
began to beat him with their fists. SELLER has some sort of
burglar alarm in his office which he was able to activate: and
the Valley Stream, New York, Police appeared on the scene
almost immediately and arrested the two men who were beating
SELLER, The two men were taken to the Valley Stream Police
Department where SELLER swore out a warrant charging them
with assaulting him. According to AFSHAR,..SELLER said one of
these men requested to make a telephone call and was given
permission to do so. The person he called is unknown to
AFSHAR but SELLER said that within five minutes after this
man made the telephone call, the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) telephonically contacted the Chief of Police of Valley
Stream, New York, and asked him to convince SELLER not to press

charges against these men, The CIA promised that the men would

be deported if the charges were dropped. At the urging of the!
Valley Stream Chief of Police, SELLER dropped charges and the |

two men were released. Their present whereabouts and status
are unknown to SELLER according to AFSHAR.

7 Mr. AFSHAR said the above incident disturbs him
very much as he feels SAVAK is responsible for the beating of }
SELLER. Mr.-AFSHAR feels that they are attempting to 4
intimidate him through SELLER and he wonders how SAVAK knew
of their association. ey

On June 23, 1977, NASSER AFSHAR, supra, advised the

correct telephone number for HERMAN HARVEY SELLER is (516)
825~2424. He furnished the name and address of SELLER's

During early February, 1978, an appearance by either 4

Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams or Assistant Director ne)

T.W. Leavitt is planned before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence;

in addition, the House Select Committee on Intelligence will be similarly g

briefed in the near future. In order to dramatize graphically the constant

threat to national security posed by Hostile Intelligence Services, a video- a

tape presentation of approximately 20 minutes is felt to be most desirable. be

Senate staff members have specifically requested such a film as one of 4
the most effective ways to dramatize our problems for the Senators.

At the present time, the Instructional Technological Services
Staff, Training Division, have advised the Intelligence Division (INTD)
they have a number of important projects; but, in view of the short dead-
lines for the preparation of a suitable presentation, INTD believes that
this project should be given priority status.

SUBVERSIVE MATTER - COMMUNIST PARTY, ALLINF

‘TIGR CONTAINED

alae Bare 0h 0b ev GAL. —

PURPOSE: To advise concerning results of a review of this
case for a determination as to whether investigation is
warranted under the Espionage-X statutes.

SYNOPSIS: While: conducting an applicant investigation on
279/76, WFO determined from the landlord of captioned sub-
ject that he had seen pictures of Joseph Stalin and ~N
Pidel Castro hanging in subject's apartment. Also observed
were communist literature and what appeared to be CIA reports
in paperback form under subject's bed.

According to this landlord, subject used to live in
Chile but was deported and is presemtly employed as a staff
member with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities (SSCIA).

In discussing this matter with the Department, it
was learned that a Departmental Attorney in the Investigation
Review Unit (IRU) recalled that sometime during Lawton's
employment with the SSCIA a charge was made that he had leaked
elassified information.

There is no indication that the CIA reports
observed under Lawton's bed were classificd, which is a
necessary element for instituting investigations under the
espionage statutes.

Furthermore, investigations regarding leaks of
classified information are initiated at the specific
instructions of the Department, which to date has not
instructed us to take any action with respect to the allega-
tion that Lawton leaked classified information while with
the SSCIA.

Memorandum to Mr. R. J. Gallagher
Rez: George Albert Lawton, Jr.

7 Through our Liaison Section, CIA was apprised
of the information regarding Lawton and further that he
is presently residing in Paris, France. CIA advised that
based upon this information, there is no justification
for any independent action on their part abroad regarding
Lawton. However, should the FBI feel that Lawton is of
snfificient interest to make a written formal request con~
sistent with the Attorney General's guidelines, CIA will
consider conducting investigation abroad.

RECOMMENDATION: For information.

DETAILS: On 4/9/76, WFO, while conducting an applicant
investigation, determined from Fdwin C. Loureiro, captioned
subject's landlord, that while cleaning subject's apartment,
he noticod pictures of Joseph Stalin and Fidel Castro hang-
ing in the apartment, as well as an assortment of communist
literatu:-e and what appeared to be CIA reports in paperback
form under Lawton's bed. According to Loureiro, Lawton used
to live in Chile but he was deported and is presently
employed as a staff member with the SSCIA.

Lawton's employment with the SSCIA was verified by
WFO as of 4/22/76.

Upon verification of subject's employment with the

SSCIA, a discussion concerning this matter was held on 5/4/76
by SAs L. J, Brune, Jr., and S. F. Phillips with Mr. Michael E.
Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of
the Department and Mr. Jeffrey Harris, Chief of the Department's
Investigation Review Unit, along with other representatives of
their officas. During this discussion, Harris was tele~
phonically advised by his IRU associate Joseph diGenova

- @ 7 @

AW 54928 DocId:32989595 Page 63
i



Memorandum to Mr. R. 3, Gallagher
Res George Albert Lawton, Jr.

that Lawton was employed by tha SSCIA as of two weeks
prior to 5/4/76 as a consultant concerning Salvadore
Allende (deceased leader of Chile) and Chile itself.
According to Harris, diGenova recalled that sometime
during the time of Lawton'’s employment with the SSCIA

a charge was made that Lawton had Idaked classified
information. How that situation was resolved was not
clarified during diGenova's telephonic conversation with
Harris. .

There is no indication that what appeared to be
CIA reports in paperback form observed under Lawton's bed
were classified, which is a necessary element for institut-
ing investigations under the espionage statutes. Further-
nore, investigations regarding leaks of classified informa~
tion are instituted at the specific instructions of the
Pepartment, which to date has not instructed us to take any
action with respect to the allegation that Lawton leaked
classified information while with the SSCIA.

Through our Liaison Section, CIA was contacted
and apprised of the information regarding Lawton, including
his current residence in Paris, France. SA V. H. Woimar
personally spoke with Mr. George Kalaris, Chief, Counter-
intelligence Division, CIAHQ, on 11/3/76. Kalaris advised
that CIA's position is that based upon the information fur-
nished thus far regarding Lawton, there is no justification
for any independent action regarding Lawton by CIA abroad.
However, if the FBI considers Lawton of sufficient interest
to request investigation of him abroad, CIA will consider
same upon receipt of a formal request in writing from the
FBI which is consistent with the Attorney General's
guidelines.

respectively, assuming roles on this significant Special which had

been handled by others'who, in light of other compelling circumstances,

were reassigned rather abrupily. There follows a summary of specific

facets of their performance which have been clearly beyond what would

have been normally called for in this-Sittation, _

Miss Stanley had but minimal training of a few hours in™
taking on her new duties; Brennan likewise had but limited training
time. They both, with a minimum of supervision, demonstrated
imagination and initiative in meeting a variety of problems and per-
acceptable. The ‘following is illustrative: They devised and refined
an-elaborate indexing system for the Special, enabling us to quickly

locate and retrieve relevant correspondence with a minimum of infor-
mation. This has proven invaluable to all levels of Bureau officials

and supervisors who frequently call. upon us for information relating
to the Special. They set up and refined an elaborate tickler system” 1

for the voluminous substantive and administrative correspondence gst 2
generated by the Special, thus facilitating our day-to-day work. ee
Many times working under compelling time limitations, they assigked
numerous supervisors in the excising and duplication of documents

heretofore maintained only as ticklers, Another task performed by
them, significantly beyond what would be called for by their Grade
level, consisted of their preparation of abstracts (precise summaries
of lengthy documents) for inclusion in a Community Index maintained
by the Director, Central Intelligence. As an adjunct to the Special,
they have located, isolated, excised and duplicated a large volume
of documents concerning a particular subject which had been given
to the Church Committee so it may now be given, at the Attorney
General's instructions, to the subject's estate, This effort, like
most all the others ae bd these two employees, was of a
performance contributed immeasurably toward fulfilling the
Bureau's responsibilities in this matter.

REQUKST OF U.S. SENATOR

ROBERY MORGAN OF THE U.S.

SENATE, SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
oa

cas eeresteeegecae
Day 7, OA
‘This is im response to your recent telephonic
request of me concerning what steps might be taken by your
office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to
accommodate requests of U. S. Senator Robert Morgan of
North Carolina for authorization for public release of
certain FBI documents. The following is set forth to
present this matter in a complete context and to submit
to you at the same time my suggestions and observations.

BERR

Senator Morgan was a member of the SSC. As such
he had access to the FBI documents submitted to the.SSC
during its extensive review of FBI operations.
we In response to requests of the SSC and its

staff and in accordance with agreed to procedures we
delivered to the SSC staff on August 28, 1975, several
documents that related to our investigations and
Countérintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) directed against
the Kian in North Carolina. These documents were excised
individually to exclude data that would obviously identify
informants. The nature of these particular documents is
such that when compared with each other the identity of a
former FBI Klan informant, George Dorsett, can be deduced.
This fact was recognized by the SSC, or its staff, and in
fact a notation "IDENTS SOURCE" was made on the face of one
ee aim of the documents after they were delivered to the SSC. y /

The Attorney General

On December 5 and 6, 1975, various North Carolina
news media reported Senator Morgan's statements to the effect
that the FBI formed and provided operating funds for the
Confederate Knights of the Ru Klux Klan (CKKKK) in the 1960's
an a and counter the existing United Klans of America

The Special Agent in Charge (SAG) of the Charlotte
Office of the FBI issued a press release on December 6, 1975,
in which he summarized the FBI's investigation of the UKA.
He described the nature of the UKA, i.e. the alleged promotion
of Americanism, white supremacy and segregation of the races.
He alluded to the anti-Negro, anti-Semitic nature of the UKA
and the involvement of Klan members and leaders in the
past in atrocities including beatings, bombings and murders
as well as involvement in activities seeking to deny others
their Constitutional rights. He deseribed the UKA klaverns in
North Carolina as having the same aims and purposes as the
national organization.

He specifically stated "It recently has been
widely reported that the FBI has been responsible for
organizing new chapters or klaverns of the Klan. At no
time was the FBI directly responsible fr the organizing of any
new Klan chapter or klavern." He denied that FBI informants
were ever instructed to advocate, initiate or engage in acts
of violence.

It appears that this press release by the SAG of the
Charlotte Office has been considered by Senator Morgan as a
challenge to his credibility. Apparently Senator Morgan feels
that if the FBI documents from which he has formed his
hig pa ee are released to the public, the dispute can be
resolved.

The documents in question are enclosed in two forms.
In one form they are the same as provided to the SSC. In the
other they are excised more extensively, to which I will
refer later.

54928 DocId:32989595 Page 71



The Attorney General

Particular attention is directed to the August 22, 1967,
airtel from SAC, Charlotte to Director, FBI, which sets forth
the formulation of the CKKKK. This document setsforth steps
being taken in conjunction with an informant to utilize the
CKKKK as a disruptive effort directed against the UKA. It
is realized that this document gives the impression that the
FBI formed the CKKKK.

Attention is also directed to SAC, Charlotte, airtel
to Director, FBI, dated September 12, 1967. In paragraph one,
page one of this document it is specifically stated that the
Charlotte Office desired to continue to capitalize on the
dissension between Dorsett and UKA Grand Dragon without having
to form a separate organization. "However, those formar UKA
members who followed Dorsett were adamant in their intentions
to form another organization, and in order to put the Bureau
in the best position possible (deleted) became Grand Dragon of
this new group." :

This same communication specifically requests FBI
Headquarters to authorize the paying of at least a portion of the
expenses relating to the formation of the CKKKK.

By airtel dated September 25, 1967, from Director,
fBI,to SAC, Charlotte, it is stated, "The Bureau will not,
under any circumstances, approve the paying, by your office,
of all expenses in connection with the formation of the new
Klan organization known as the Confederate Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan (CKKKK) by (deleted). The Bureau will, however,
approve justifiable personal expenses incurred by the
informant in this regard."

By memorandum to you dated December 19, 1975,
I- enclosed a proposed memorandum for delivery to Senator
Frank Church, Chairman of the SSC. These memoranda
advised of the disclosure in the December 10, 1975,
issue of the Greensboro, North Carolina, "Greensboro Daily
News," of the identity of FBI informant George F. Dorsett,
attributed to a "Senate Intelligence Committee source."
In these memoranda I enumerated several documents that
were delivered to the SSC by the FBI and which when
examined as a group and compared with each other led
to Mr. Dorsett's identification as an informant. I
reiterated my request that the December 19, 1975, memorandum
be delivered to Senator Church by memorandum of February 11, 1976.

The Attorney General

By memorandum dated April 22, 1976, I furnished
to you a copy of an article appearing in the April 4, 1976,
issue of the "Greensboro Daily News" captioned "Morgan
Confirms Spy Within KKK," and with a subcaption "George Dorsett."
A copy of this news article is also enclosed herewith. By
this memorandum I again requested that this matter be brought
to the attention of Senator Church.

: It is my understanding that the above incidents were
net referred to the SSC.

I wish to point out that Mr. Dorsett's identity as
an FBI informant has not been publicly acknowledged by the.
FBI nor to the extent of my knowledge by Mr. Dorsett.

By letter dated May 11, 1976, Senator Morgan requested
of you the clearance for release of the documents in question.
A copy of Senator Morgan's letter is also enclosed.

I and my staff have given this matter very serious
consideration. I feel that the documents should not be
approved for release inasmuch as the request is a personal
request of Senator Morgan; the request is not a request of
the SSC; it is not related to SSC business; the SSC has had
numerous hearings relating to the material covered in these
documents and has issued its reports; the SSC no longer has
standing to conduct business; it is felt nothing is to be
gained by continued exposure and concentration on
past specific incidents; Senator Morgan entered into the
Congressional Record on May 10, 1976, my May 8, 1976, remarks
at Fulton, Missouri, and Senator Morgan at that time stated
his agreement with my remarks,

\ In Senator Morgan’s letter he also requested the
\ approval for public release of certain documents relating to
the Black Panther Party (BPP) and COINTELPRO actions directed
! against the BPP in North Carolina. In regard to these documents
(copies of which are also enclosed in two formats) it should
be noted that Larry Donnell Little, who as BPP leader was
the person most affected by the COINTELPRO actions, was advised by
your Special Review Committee of the fact COINTELPRO actions
were taken against him. Little is believed to be currently

MW 54928 Docld:32989595 Page 73



The Attorney General

running for Alderman in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and
disclosure of these documents at this time could be construed
as an improper intrusion into local politics by the

Federal Government. In an interview of Little reported in the
December 20, 1975, issue of the "Winston-Salem Chronicle,"
“inston-Salem, North Carolina, Little is quoted as being
aware of the Freedom of Information Act as a means of
obtaining material from FBI files.

In the event you feel that this matter can better
be resolved by the public release of these documents, they
have been examined and additional excisions made which,
should they be released, will not disclose the identity of an
informant. Copies of the documents with these excisions are
enclosed herewith. (It is noted that these documents in
this format were provided to you by memorandum dated
July 9, 1976.)

I have also given consideration to the submission of
a letter to Senator Morgan either over your signature or mine,
which letter would acknowledge that the FBI did exploit the
CKKRK as a means of disrupting the UKA. I interpose no
objection to such a letter providing it is worded in such a
manner that a specific informant is not identified nor
Senator Morgan's disclosure of this informant is acknowledged.
Any such letter should of course accurately set forth the events
based on the information contained in these documents which I
feel is accurately summarized above.

Senator Morgan has expressed his concern about a
critical reaction in North Carolina to his statements critical of
the FBI by former FBI employees. Senator Morgan has implied
that he considers such reactions as being orchestrated by the FBI.
Such is not so and I would trust that Senator Morgan would
accept my statement to this effect in good faith. The FBI
does not in any manner direct the activities of former FBI
employees, either to perform or to desist.

I hope that this summary will aid you in determining
the most effective means of meeting the request of
Senator Morgan. I wish to emphasize that neither I nor my
staff desires to pursue a position of obstinance in this situation.

I do feel strongly, however, that we cannot acquiesce to
the public disclosure of an FBI informant who has not otherwise
been disclosed.

We have no objection to the release of the November 6, 1950

7 memorandum from J. Patrick Coyne to J. Edgar Hoover and Raymond

q Whearty or the November 8, 1950 letter from J, Edgar Hoover to J.
Patrick Coyne, along with the enclosure entitled "Report by the Inter-
departmental Intelligence Conference to the National Security Council
Regarding the Recent Outbreak of Violence by Puerto Rican Nationalists."

Concerning the report discussing internal security programs in the

United States under the control of the IIC, enclosed with the July 25,

1961 letter from Mr. Hoover to McGeorge Bundy, the NSC Staff has
determined that it should not be released in its present form. From

the information contained in this report, it appears that events could

be reconstructed so as to identify confidential FBI sources, the pro-
tection of which is essential to our intelligence operations. There- aaa
fore before this document may be released to the Senate Select Com va

information develope: uring an applicant-type investigation

d4nvolvement with communist movement and possible possession
of classified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) material. —

' Im an addendum therewith, the Legal Counsel Division. conclhuded
that the matter should be treated preferably as a possible
leak or unauthorized disclosure of classified information. In
an attempt to resolve this issue an effort was made to determine
lawton's present employment and to disseminate a copy of WFO's \
Letterhead Memorandum (LHM) concerning Lawton to CIA Headquarters.
The Dixector of Security of that agency would not accept the :
LOM because of an asserted absence of jurisdiction. It has
been determined that Lawton has cublet his Washington, D. C.,
. apartment and is now in Paris, France. A representative of
CI~4, Liaison Section, will proceed to contact the Counter~ °

that agency would now have an interest in view of the subject's
foreign residence. ; :

FINAL REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT Director Soc'y
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES Vor
OVA

FROM : ¢,

PURPOSE: The purpose of this memorandum is to advise of the
receipt of a letter dated August 12th from author Ladislas
Farago, enclosing a copy of a letter that Farago wrote to
Senator Walter-Mendale; member of the Senate Sélect Committee
to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence
Activities (SSIC), in which Farago inquires regarding the full
text of a quotation from an FBI memorandum regarding Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., which appears’on page 121 of Book III of the
SSIC's Final Report.

DETAILS: Ladislas Farago is a well-known author who currently
is completing an in-depth biography of J. Edgar Hoover. By-
letter dated August 12th, he has sent Mr. Kelley a copy of a *
letter he wrote Senator Walter Mondale. In that letter he
refers to Senator Mondale's membership on the SSIC and calls
attention to the following quotation regarding the FBI's
investigative coverage of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which
appears on page 121 of Book III of the SSIC's Final Report:

"Justifying the need for the microphone coverage, the
Chief of the FBI's Internal Security Section wrote that
the FBI was ‘attempting' to obtain information about 'the
(private) activities of Dr. King and his associates' so
that Dr. King could be ‘completely discredited.'"

In his letter to Senator Mondale, Farago points out
that it would have been more proper to have quoted verbatim
from the FBI memorandum, rather than to have paraphrased it in
the manner done on page 121 of Book III. He asks Senator Mondale
(and in his letter to the Director, he also asks Mr. Kelley) to
make available a copy of the FBI memorandum whi CO Yes as the

Monroe ‘to Moore memo
RE:

INQUIRY FROM LADISLAS FARAGO

The FBI memo in question is dated January 28, 1964, and
captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist

Influence in Racial Matters, Internal Security - Communist."

full text of the data

"Because of

moral weaknesses

The
in question regarding Dr. King is:

the communist influence on him, he

the security of the Nation, completely
obvious means to this end is through his
and we are attempting to obtain as many

facts as possible relative to his low morals with a view
to effectively using this information. The activities of
King and his associates at the Willard Hotel in Washington,
D. C., 1/6-7/64 ‘have demonstrated the potential for us in
effecting technical coverage."

A comparison of the above-quoted data with the
paraphrased account of it that appears in the Final Report of
the SSIC does, of course, reflect substantial differences.

The material which the FBI provided to the SSIC in
1975-76 has since been turned over by the SSIC to the recently
formed Senate Select Committee on Intelligence which is headed by
Senator Daniel K. Inouye. Thus, Senator Mondale (who served on
the ‘SSIC, and to whom Farago addressed his letter requesting the
full text of the January 28, 1964, FBI memorandum) does not
have access to the data requested by Farago. Senator Mondale
probably will refer Farago's request to Senator Inouye; and
in response to the virtually identical request that Farago
has made of Mr. Kelley, it is felt that the Bureau should
suggest to him that he contact Senator Inouye's new Intelli-
gence Committee.

RECOMMENDATION: That this memorandum be approved and returned
to the External Affairs Division so that receipt of Farago's
letter can orally be acknowledged, at which time he will be
told that his request for the text of the January 28, 1964,
FBI memorandum should be addressed to Senator Inouye's new,

My dear Director Kelléyr———-

I take the liberty of sending you herewith copy of a let-

ter I have just written to Senator Mondale which, I am con-
° fident, speaks for itself. I cannot overemphasize the impert-
ance of the issue I am raising. The possibility that the Church
Committee staff has added the word "private'' to the Baumgard-
ner memorandum is the acid test of their bias and proof posi-
tive of the tendentiousness of their entire report. I am hope-
ful that it will be possible either for Senator Mondale or
for you, my dear Mr. Director, to make available to me a copy q
of the entire Beumgardner memorandum for my inspection,

Permit me, sir, to take this opportunity to congratulate
you on your remarkable "performance" at your press confe-
rence on August 11, and to thank you for your efforts of plac- “th
ing this whole matter in the proper perspective. As one of —
the gratifying results of your presentation I noticed the edi-
torial in this morning's New York Times which seemed to me
the first more or less objective treatment of the topic and
showed: some willingness on the Times' part to give you and
perhaps the Bureau under, your leadership the benefit of
the doubt.

May I end this letter on a pa note that is perhaps SEP did IAT
presumptious and uncalled for, but sincerely felt. I w ‘a-

ther disturbed how tired and drawn you looked, not so mu

physically as, indeed, emotionally, showing the stress and —_——
strain. In the interest of all of us who are in your corner,

and whose gratitude to the Bureau will never diminish, I am

asking you to take good care of yourself and preserve your

ReneS Ser
DATE BY
My dear Senator Mondale: A
“I was gratified by your selection and nomination, and thrill at the prospect
of your election as our vice president in the Carter Administration. For a long
time, having watched your performance in the Senate and on the Church Committee,
I was hoping for such recognition. I have come to be convinced that our nation
would be restored to its historic path of basic decency if a politician like

you would be moved to the top or near the top in the Executive Branch. I con-
gratulate you on your nomination and wish you (and us) the best in November.

This, however, is not why I am writing, except that I am delighted to have
this opportunity to express my sentiments. I understand that you were in super-
visory charge of the Church Committee's monumental reportage on the Federal
Bureau of Investigation--monumental, indeed, for your young staff did a prodi-
gious job in researching the FBI story and performed a heroic task in unearth-
ing data to’justify your misgivings and docyment your charges.

However, I am not as impressed with what should have been mandatory objec-
tivity of your staff in the exploitation and presentation of this vast research
fund. The authors of your reports on the FBI were evidently overwhelmed by the
negative aspects of their raw material and permitted themselves to be carried
into pronounced bias which is evident on practically every page of their re-
ports dealing with the Bureau. 4

I am writing what I hope will be the definitive biography of the late Di- {
rector, called "The Secret American: A Political Biography of J. Edgar Hoover-- :
Triumph or Tragedy." It will be published in 1977, by Doubleday, and made into
a motion picture by 20th Century-Fox, on the pattern of my other movies,

"Patton" and "Tora, Tora, Tora." :

I was held up in the completion of this difficult book by the delays and
vicissitudes of your investigation. Now I am rather pleased to say that, in the
final analysis, it produced very little that was new to me or anything funda-
mental that would have altered my essentially positive attitude to the Bureau
and Mr. Hoover. I felt, indeed, that far too much emphasis was placed by your
Committee on the sordid and sinister, combustible and photogenic aspects of
the Bureau's work and Hoover's regime, that, of course, encompassed far, far
greater areas than you had time or inclination to cover.

This was especially true in the Martisi.. Luther King syndrome that, please
believe me, is not as simple and cut-and-dry as it appears in the present-
ation of your conspicuously partisan staff. This is what bothers me and why
I am seeking your urgent help, in order to clarify a deeply disturbing matter
emerging . from your final report. On page 121 in Book III, under caption
"C. Microphone Surveillance of Dr. King: January 1964-November 1965 (which
incidentally is the only such caption printed exclusively in capital letters,
for extra emphasis, I guess), a quotation appears in fragmented form from
a mysterious memorandum attributed to Frederick Baumgardner and dated Ja-
nuary 28, 1964, according to footnote #170 on the same page. This is how
the alleged Baumgardner memo is quoted:

"Justifying the need for microphone coverage, the Chief of the FBI's
Internal Security Section wrote that the FBI was ‘attempting' to obtain
information about 'the [private] activities of Dr. King and his associates'
so that Dr. King could be 'completely discredited. '"

The following passages are cited in quotation marks apparently added by
the author of your report:

1. "attempting" :
2. "the private activities of Dr. King. and his associates"
3. "completely discredited" : F Hae

The following word is put in brackets, eithersby Mr. Baumgardner in the
original document or by the author of your report quoting from it:

[private]

To my mind, this is the key document of this particular subject, present-
ing what your author himself described as the justification of the microphone
surveillance of Dr. King. It would have been better and more proper if the
sentence had been quoted verbatim instead in its paraphrased form with quo-
tation marks and, apparently, brackets added. In this form one’ cannot know,
in the evaluation of this justification, was what written by Mr. Baumgardner
and what was added by your author, and the contours of fakery and fraud are
thus permitted to cast a reflection on the entire report. i

I mist know whether the bracketed word "private'' was in the original or
had been added, presumably to shift the emphasis of the Baumgardner memoran-
dum and, of course, of the FBI's “attempt to obtain information"; sas: dll as
of the very nature of the information the Bureau was "attempting" to obtain.

I mist know the entire context in which the words "completely discredited"
were used by Baumgardner and the purpose of the truncated quotation as pre-
sented by your staff.

The simplest solution of the problem would be if you would, post festa,
publish the full text of the Baumgardner memorandum, a step that would be
justified by the importance of the memo itself and its significance to your
Presentation and argumentation. If this proves impossible at this Stage of the

| game, I would greatly appreciate it if you would make a copy of the memo-

randum available to me in its. entirety, so that I :could deteniine the ac-
tual formulation of the Bureau's reasons for the microphonic surveillance
of Dr. King and the basic background of the project. I am sending a copy
‘of this letter to Director Kelley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
with the request that he help- me in the procurement. of an authentic copy
of the. Baumgardner memorandum; and I am writing to Messrs. William C. Sul-
livan and Frederick Baumgardner, asking them to clarify this matter for me.

SENATS SELECT COMMITTEE ON INLBLLIGENCE ACTIVILiIas (ssc)

In considering this matter, it should be noted that the
SSC was very repetitive in some of its reporting,
particularly concerning the Martin uuther King, Jr.,
investigation and COINTELPRO. for example, the same

data concerning the King matter appears in two portions

of Book II (Introduction and Summary, and Findings) as
well as the detailed case study included in Book III.

Iven within Book III, there were noted duplicate references
to the same issue. Similar duplications of reporting

vere noted as to COINTZLPRO.

In the interests of brevity, this critique
will not repeat eur observations once made although the
objectionable material or presentation may be repeated.
Also, we will not repeat those observations previously
made in our earlier memoranda but merely refer below to
those earlier observations found to apply to finished
reports as they did for the drafts, Finally, we have
concentrated in this presentation on what we consider
the more significant objections, to the exclusion of
minor and marginal matters.

COTALELPRO:

FBI memorandum dated March 15, 1976, contained
our observations after the review of the draft of the
SSG's case study concerning COINTELPRO. Our memorandun
dated spril 15, 1976, contained our observations of the
draft of that portion of the SSC Report, Book II, heaéed
Findings.

“ost of our prior observations relating to
cOmITELPRO matters in the above tvo memoranda are applicable
to the final versions of Books II and III. In summary,
it is our corment that the material in Rook ITI continues
to include many editorialized comments and distortions.

It is replete with items taken out of context, selected

promiscuously to support an SSC conclusion without regard
to other information available to the Committee, and

set forth in a manner to depict this Bureau in a most
derogatory fashion. Selected quotes of various past

material presented to the Committee by FBI deposers, or

observations as to additional objectionable material and
presentations noted in the final printings,

On page 223 of Book II, it is stated, "ven
after Dr. King's death, Agents in the Field were proposing
methods for harassing his widow."

Observations: It is true that a field office
of the FBI suggested counterintelligence activities against
Mrs. King. However, this suggestion was disapproved by
FBI Headquarters and the field office was advised that no
ecounterintelligence activity against Mrs, King was desired.

It is believed that the method by which the SSC referred
to the sugsested activity against lics. King lacks
objectivity in that it does not include the fact that
the suggestion was rejected.

Pare 146 of Book III contains a footnote,
mumber 289, which states, "It should be noted that the
Supervisor in charge of the King case is still in a high
position with the FBI and handled the committee's dcocuzents
requests in the King case investigation,"

Observations: ‘the information was footnoted
although it appears that it vould have been far more
proper for it to have heen ineluded in the details rather
than as a footnote. ‘This is highly signifieant because,
and more importantly, it is suggestive of being a gross
reporting abuse, ‘The information quoted was not included
in the draft of the report which ve were permitted to

thus prevented our rightful ability to review this item,

Pase 86 of Book III, in discussing the FBI's
acquisition of information about King's personal life,
stated, “Moreover, in order to preclude any further
dissemination of information obtained curing the electronic
surveillances of br. King, the Committee requested the
FBI to excise from all documents submitted to the Committee
any information which vas so obtained.”

Observations: ‘he implication in the above
reporting is that the SSC attempted to aveid securing from
the FBI information concerning King's personal life. We
are of the view that the SSC did not adequately provide |
for its not being furnished such information. At no tire
did any of the numerous SSC requests for information
concerning King specifically ask that ve not furnish
personal activity information. ‘he SSC did exclude from

its requests, by specific wording, information derived

as the products of electronic surveillances on King himself.
While it is true that this exelusion did result in our

not furnishing ruch such information to the SSC, it is

also true that ve did furnish information concerning King's
personal life and activities where such information mot

the criteria of the requests and did not derive from
eleetronic surveillances on King. In short, the SSC's
exelusions were in terms of sources rather than contents.

On pages 87 and 88 of Book III, it is reported
that in 1962 the FBI ordered its field offices to review
their files for "subversive" information about King and to
submit that information to PBI Headquarters in reports
"suitable for dissemination." Footnote miucer 27 on
page 88 identifies the specifie FBI Headquarters comm:-
nication in this matter and ends with a statement that
these instructions to the field vere issued on the first
day of King's trial in which he and 700 other civil rights
demonstrators vere charged in Albany, Georgia, vith
parading without a pernit.

Observations: ‘he manner in which the foregoing
was reported implies that FEI Headquarters’ instructions
vere affeeted by the trial. ‘here is no evidence that
they were. .

On page 111 of Bool: III appears the statement,
"The instruction to use ‘all possible investigative techniques’
appears to have dictated the intensification of the
COMINFIL investigation of the SCLC."" The quoted portion
is in reference to a letter from the Director, FBI, to a
Special Agent in Charge dated October 1, 1963, which is
identified as footnote number 126 and vhich letter is
quoted on pages 110 and 111. ‘The significant portion of
this letter is the sentence which starts, "fullest considcration
should be given to the use of all possible investigative
techniques in the investigation... ."

Observations: It will be noted that the Bureau
communication which was documented uses the languace,
"Pullest consideration should be given... ." On the |
other hand, the language of the SSC report is that the
instruction was to use all possible investigative techniques.
Surely the SSC ought to be able to distinguish between an
instruetion to consider using something versus on |
instruction to actually use something. This, to our mind,
is not objective reporting. :

On page 141 of Rook III appears a discussion |
concerning an FBI effort to dissuade a university from
avarding King an honorary degree, Footnote number 257 cites
an FBI memorandum from Frederick Baumgardner to William
Sullivan dated March 4, 1964, and states that the officer
who handled the assignment was given a letter of
commendation by the Director, “and a monetary award."

Observations: The cited memorandum verifies
the conferring of the letter of commendation but makes no
mention whatsoever of a monetary award and no such award
was received for this assignment by the “officer,” While
it is recognized that the diserepaney here is a relatively
minor one in that we acknowledge the recognition given
to the "officer," we believe that this instance of
inaccurate reporting of the facts should be brought to
notice.

General Observation: While a tremendous number
of footnotes were used in the little over 100-pape King

these pages many statements by the SSC which are not
documented and frequently fall in the general area of

Use of Informants in FBI Intelligence Investigations,"

conclusions.

Some of the conclusions are that the PI
conducts political investigations of organizations and
individuals through the use of informants.

Observations: Luring PRI testirony before the
Cozmmittee, it vas repeatedly stated that ve did not use v4
informants for political purposes and all conclusions of
this nature were denied by PBI officials. However, the

FBI denials of these conclusions vere given only minimal
exposure in the Senort.

In particular, the SSC made the broad allegation
that informants cnsazed in illegal and violent activities,
implying that it was with Eureau approval, vhich was
strongly denied during the course of the SSC hearings.
égain, however, the denials were given only minimal
treatment in the Report. In general, the foregoing is
also applicable to the material in Book IZ related to the
use of FBI informants.

the statement, ". . . the BI has 'been able to identify!

Observations: Statistics listed in the above-
referred-to footnotes vere included in one of the ssc's
case studies on the subject of surreptitious entries in
the form of an Appendix. When the FBI was permitted to

the Appendix in the printing of the case study. ‘the
deletion was made and the statistics do not appear in the

the CDL should be abolished as “impractical, umvise and
dangerous," His directive stated that there was “no
statutory or other present justification for keeping the
list. The SSC elaims that, "Upon receipt of this order,
the SBI Director did not in fact abolish its list. ‘The
£BI continued to maintain an index of persons 'who may be
dangerous or potentially dangerous to the public safety
or internal security of the United States.' In response
to the Attorney General's order, the FBI merely changed the
name of the list from Custodial Detention List to Security
Index, Instructions to the field stated that the Security
Index should be kept ‘strictly confidential,’ and that

it should never be mentioned in FBI reports or ‘discussed
with azencies or individuals outside the Bureau’ exeept
for military intelligence agencies."

the SSC report then goes on to state, "this
ineident provides an example of the FBI's ability to
conduct domestic intelligence operations in opposition
to the policies of an Attorney Ceneral. Lespite attorney
General Biddle's order, the 'dengerousness' list continued
to be kept, and investigations in support of that List
continued to be a significant part of the Bureau's worl."

Qbservations: As noted above, the report stated
that the Attorney General "ordered that the Custodial
Letention List should be abolished as ‘impractical, umviso,
and dangerous.’ 4 revieuv of a merorandum from Attorney
General Biddie to Assistant Attorney General Hugh B. Cox
and J, Edsar Hoover dated July 16, 1943, reveals that the
dsttorney General made no such statement. ‘The memorandum
does state, ‘There is no statutory authorization or other
present justification for keeping a 'custodial detention’
list of citizens," It is our contention that this statement
does not effect an order to abolish the CDL. Vurther, when
the PBI changed the name of the cards and list to Security
Index, it was to be utilized in investigating dangerous

and potentially dangerous individuals other than alien
enemies, but no mention of detention was made in connection
with the list.

On page 69, Book IZ, under a heading entitled
"Domestic Covert Action," appears a statement, ihe Security
Index was revised to include such persons." This statement
refers to a previous statement indicating that the most
intensive domestic intelligence investigations, and
frequently COINTELPRO operations, were targeted against
persons identified not as eriminais or as criminal suspects ©
but as "rabble rousers,"" "agitators," "key activists," or
"key black extremists," because of militant =tetorice and
leadership.

Observations: The Security Index was never
revised to include rabble rousers, agitators, key activists,
or others as listed in the SSC report. Individuals were
placed on the Security Index if, during the investigation
of a particular individual, certain criteria for such
placement were met. An individual could be defined as a
rabble rouser, ete., and have been on the Security Index;
however, as noted previously, the Index was not revised for
the purpose of including such persons.

On page 72, Book TI, under a heading entitled
"Hew Left' Intelligence," there is set forth information
from SAC (Special Agent in Charge) Letter 68-21, dated
April 2, 1968, which advised field offices of areas of inquiry
regarding subjects of New 1: ft. investigations and of informa-
| tion which during the investigations might establish a potential
| threat to security, ‘he report continues that such porsons would

of emergency) because of “anarchistie tendencies" even if
membership in a subversive organization could not be proven,

that "mere dissent and opposition to Govermiental policies
pursued in a legal and constitutional manner" was “not
sufficient to warrant inclusion in the Security Index."

It further indicated tuat “anti-Vietnam or peace group
sentiments" were not supposed to justify investigation.

‘the footnote then states, “The failure of this admonition
to achieve its stated objeetive is discussed in the findings

Commencin= on page 125, Book Ii, under a heading
entitled "the PRI's Scerct tiduinistrative Index,’ " che
report states that during the Fall of 1971, the Eureau

Congressional curtailment of domestic intelligence investi-
gations, referring to repeal of the Emergency Detention Act
(EDA) and "set a course of evasion of the will of Congress
which continued, particularly with Justice Department approval,
until 1973." he report indicates that, in the event the
EDA was repealed, the FBI intended to continue as before
the repeal took place, and following the repeal, established
a vationale for keeping the Security Index of potentially
danzerous individuals. The report states, “fBI officials
hoped there tould be a vay to circumvent the repeal ‘in which
the essence of the Security Index and emergency detention
of dangerous Individuals could be utilized under Presidential
powers.’ *

The xeport then goes on to describe various
memoranda which vere written during the time frame
immediately preeeding and following the repeal of the BDA.
Memoranda preceding the repeal did indicate that, if the
4et was repealed, there might be some future date when an
emergency could occur and Congress could possibly be
convinced to reinstitute such emergency procedures as
outlined in the EDA. ‘he report indicates that following
the repeal the Attorney General was advised by letter of
the FBI's proposal to maintain an Administrative Index (Adex)
of individuals who would pose a threat to the internal
security of the country. According to the report, the
letter made no reference to the theory prevailing vithin
the FBI that this new Index vould serve as a basis for a
revived detention program at some future date during an
emergency. ‘he report indieates that, when the attorney
General advised the FBI that the repeal of the EDA did not
prohibit the FBI from compiling an Adex, he did not deal
with the question of whether the Index vould also serve as
a round-up list for a future emergency, It is noted that
the Attorney General also stated that the Department did
not desire a copy of the new Index and, therefore, abdicated
even the minimal supervisory role performed previously by
the [epartnent in its review of the Security Index, Such
an Index as established placed the FBI in the position of
being able to make the sole determination as to which
individuals should be placed thereon, ‘he report indicates
that there vere two major consequences of the new system in
that the Index was expanded to inelude an “elastic category:
'the new breed of subversive’ and the Reserve Index, which
“had never been disclosed to the Justice Department, was
incorporated into the Administrative Index." ‘fhe report
further sets forth one of the standards for including an
individual on the Adex to indicate the breadth of this list.
These criteria vere furnished the Department in 1972 and
“the Attorney General did not question the fact that the
Administrative Index was more than an administrative aid for

conducting investigations, as he had previously been told."
One memorandum indicated a representative of the Department
agreed with the view held that there might be circumstances
wherein it would be necessary to quickly identify
individuals who were a threat to the national security

and the President could then go to Congress for emergency
legislation permitting apprehension and detention. This
section of the report concludes by indicating that, although
the Attorney General did not formally authorize the Adex
as a continuance of the previous detention list, there was
informal Departmental knowledge that the FBI would proceed
on that basis, and Later one FBI official recognized that
the Adex could be interpreted as a means to circumvent
repeal of the EDA.

On page 127, under a heading entitled "Reconsideration
of FBI Authority," a discussion ensues regarding the
authority of the FBI to conduct domestic intelligence
investigations and notes that the Bureau relied on various
Executive Orders for its basis for authority in this field
and that there was no indication that FBI guidelines
material or manual provisions were submitted to or cequested
by the Justice Department prior to 1972, As a result of
studies during that time period, the Bureau proceeded to
revise pertinent manual sections and Adex standards, As
a result of these revisions, it was intended that the Adex
would be trimmed to those who were "an actual danger nov."
The revision of the manual was completed in 1973 and applied
existing Federal statutes as a basis for the investigations
in the domestic area, Upon instituting these new standards,
the Department of Justice was then furnished eopies of the
manual section for domestic subversive investigations.

of the new breed of subversive as being in essence a

unaffiliated. The statement regarding an FBI official
recognizing that the Adex could be interpreted as a

means to circumvent repeal of the EDA was identified as
having come from an FBI Domestic Intelligence Division
position paper regarding the scope of authority, jurisdiction
and responsibility in domestic intelligence investigations.
Another footnote indicates that this position paper was
composed at the direction of then Assistant Director E. S.
Miller and was prepared by T. J. Smith, and indicates that
the position paper concluded that domestic intelligence
investigations could practically be based on the concept
that their purpose would prevent a violation of the statutes
and further indicates the Adex would be revised so it could
not be interpreted as a means to circumvent repeal of the
EDA. Footnotes further indicate that, prior to redefining
of Adex criteria in 1972, there were some individuals
included on the Adex who did not realistically pose a threat
to the national security and this would leave the Bureau.

in a vulnerable position if FBI guidelines were scrutinized
by interested Congressional committees.

Observations: The entire theme of the SSC report
regarding the formation of the Adex is that such an index was
established primarily to evade the will of Congress and
continue as a listing of persons to be apprehended during
time of emergency. It is suggested that this section is a
highly opinionated treatment of an extremely controversial
subject and one which was prepared through the select use of
quoted passages in an attempt to prove that the FBI was
evading the will of Congress. The report indicates that the
course relating to the Adex was pursued by the FBI until such
time as inquiries were made as to FBI authority to conduct
domestic intelligence investigations, and then upon fear of
disclosure of the nature of the Adex, the standards were changed
so the program could be used as an administrative aid as had
been the stated purpose throughout the course of the program.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Memoranda were prepared at the time of the repeal of the

EDA which did discuss a temporary continuance of the old
Security Index until such time as the Attorney General could
be consulted as to possible alternatives to the EDA. It

was felt at that time that such a listing should be continued
as persons so listed continued to represent a potential danger
to the national defense, and should the U. S. come under
attack by hostile forces, foreign or domestic, there was
nothing to preclude the President from going before Congress
and requesting the necessary authority to apprehend and detain
those who were considered a menace to the national defense.

If such an emergency were to occur, it was believed essential
for the FBI to Bave a listing available of individuals, backed
up by investigative files, which would provide documentation
of subversive backgrounds for use during any hearings which
could subsequently occur.

Additionally, such a listing of subversives would
be valuable in providing Secret Service with a flow of data
concerning such individuals who could pose a threat to the
safety of the President. Memoranda prepared indicate that
with the repeal of the EDA, the only prohibition which
concerned the FBI would preclude use of executive authority
for apprehension and detention, and Congress utilized the
language at the time of the repeal that "no citizen is to be
imprisoned or otherwise detained by the U. S. except pursuant
to an act of Congress." In addition, there were discussions
that care should be taken in this regard to avoid criticism
in pur-uing such a course inasmuch as it might appear to be
an atteapt to evade the will of Congress.

A study was conducted to determine whether repeal
of the EDA removed any legal basis for security investigations
and it was concluded that the repeal would not interfere, limit,
or militate against investigations of the subversives inasmuch
as the effect would be to outlaw apprehension and detention
of subjects alleged to be dangerous in time of national emergency.

It was further noted that an act such as the EDA could

easily be put back in force should an emergency convince
Gongress of its need, and as stated above, no such action
could be taken without an act of Congress. Pxior to the
institution of the Adex, the FBI directed a letter to the
Attorney General asking for his views concerning FBI authority
to continue investigations of subversive activity covered

in part by the remaining effective portions of the Internal
Security Act of 1950 and whether the FBI could maintain an
Adex of individuals which might be necessary for the FBI to
fulfill its responsibilities, The letter indicated that such
a listing would serve as an extremely valuable list of
individuals who pose a continuing threat to the safety of the
President; and of individuals who have exhibited a propensity
to conduct acts inimical to the internal security of the nation.

The Attorney General replied that the repeal of the
EDA did not affect the FBI's authority to investizate
violations of espionage, sabotage, Smith Act, and related
statutes, as well as subversive activity and related matters
in accordance with our statutory responsibilities and
Presidential directives. Furthermore, the repeal of the
Act did not alter or limit the FBI's authority and responsibility
to recall, file and index information secured pursuant to the
FBI's statutory and Presidential authority. The Adex,
when originally established, was meant to provide a readily
retrievable means for obtaining the results of the FBI's
investigations into subversive activities and related matters.
There were no provisions for emergency apprehension and
detention for individuals so listed. In fact, the former
Security Index did not contain provisions for apprehension and
detention for individuals so listed. It was merely a list
to be utilized in conjunction with the Department of Justice's
Emergency Detention Program and later the EDA for any
apprehensions and detentions. Upon instituting the Adex, the
eriteria were fairly broad and did resemble those of the
former Security Index and the Reserve Index inasmuch as it was
believed that individuals placed on the Adex would of necessity

~ 16 +

SCNATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

be similar to those who had been on the former Security Index
hecause it was the same type of individual in which we would
have an interest during an emergency. However, although there
were similarities, it should again be noted that there were

no longer plans for emergency apprehension and detention since
the statute allowing for same had been repealed by Congress.
As a result of the broad criteria first utilized for the Adex,
it readily became apparent that the number of individuals so
Listed was unwieldy. Through a careful review during late
1972, it was determined that the only standard for inclusion
on the Adex would he whether or not an individual could be
considered as an actual danger “now.”

It is our contention that although discussions were
held and memoranda prepared concerning the similarities of the
former Security Index and the Adex, there was nothing to
preclude overtures to Congress in the event of an emergency
in order to reinstitute measures similar to those provided for
in the EDA. The purpose of the Adex was that it was to be used
as an administrative index representing a list of priority cases
then under investigation by the FBI and which could be used to
help insure that the responsibilities of the FBI would ke ful-
filled in the event of an emergency. ‘The Adex was established
not with a specific view of being used for detention purposes.
Te is our further contention that such a list was rot prepared
to be used in defiance of Congress as stated in the SSC report.

Finally, the SSC report implies that the ontire
Reserve Index was included in the Adex when the latter was first
established. This is not so as only a portion of the Reserve
Index, namely Section A, was added to the Adex when first
established. Section A was essentially considered as Category
Iv of the Adex until such time as the individual cases placcd
therein could be reviewed and a determination made whether the
eriteria in the new Adex under Category IV was met in each
individual case. If such was not the case, the individual's
name was removed from the Adex. During this review, the cases
of those individuals whose names were then maintained in Section
B of the old Reserve Index were also reviewed to determine if
the activities of any included therein then met the new Adex
eriteria.

Miscellaneous: :

Referring to Book Hf, "Intelligence Activities and the Rights
of Americans, " the portion headed Introduction and Summary contains
material under a subheading Cost and Value. On pages 18 and 19 effort
is made to show that the FBI had sweeping domestic intelligence
surveillance programs which produced few useful returns in view of
their extent. As an example, it is stated that, "Between 1960 and

1974, the FBI conducted over 500, 000 separate investigations of
persons and groups under the 'subversive' category, predicated on

the possibility that they might be likely to overthrow the government

af the United States." This sentence refers to footnote number 106
which states, "This figure is the number of ‘investigative matters'
handled by the FBI in this area, including as separate items the
investigative leads in particular cases which are followed up by various
field offices, (FBI memorandum to Select Committee, 10/6/75. )"

Observations: The facts relating to this matter are as
follows. An SSC request dated September 12, 1975, Item 6a, asked for,
"The annual number cf Bureau (headquarters) case files opened under
categories 100- and 157~ for the years 1960 through 1974."" Our response
was contained in a memorandum to the SSC dated October 6, 1975, which
stated that, in response to Item 6a, the following information was
furnished. There was then set out in a three-column chart showing by
specific years, 1960 through 1974, the number. of cases opened at
Headquarters in the 100- and 157- classifications, The total for 100-

was 49,621. The total for 157~ was 33,316. This made a grand total

of 82,937. When examining the facts as set forth above and comparing
them with what is in the SSC report, including the footnote, it is

readily apparent that the SSC bas set forth a very misleading figure

when stating that, during the pertinent period, we conducted over 500, 000
separate investigations of persons. We do not know where the SSC
obtained that figure but, from the footnote which speaks about "investi-
gative matters" and "leads!' it appears that they have arrived at some

23

Patera ae :)

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

figure relating to total matters in all field offices which, in many
instances, results from counting a single case on a single individual
several times. The true number of separate investigations during
the pertinent period is barely 83,000, which figure is so far removed
from the quoted figure of 500, 000 as to make the Committee's claim
highly misleading and deceptive, to say nothing of its being absolutely
incorrect.

On page 116, under a subheading Political Intelligence, it is
stated, The FBI practice of supplying political information to the
White House and, on oceasion, responding to White House requests
for such information was established vefore 1964." It is also claimed
that the practice grew to "unprecedented dimensions under Presidents
Johnson and Nixon."

. Observations: We view the use of the terms "practice, "

7 "political information, " and "unprecedented dim ensions" as unjustifiably
overemphatic to describe what was at best an incidental, non-
programmed release of information from our files, which information
was basically disseminated by the #BI under the procedures set forth
by the provisions of the Loyalty Program (Executive Order 9845),
succeeded by Executive Order 16450. While there were a few isolated
instances where the FBI may have volunteered information which could
be labeled as "political," practically all of the implied abuses claimed
by the SSC were originated by the administration in office and grew at a
rather steady rate from President Eisenhower's administration through
the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. We
therefore view the term “unprecedented dimensions" as self-serving to
those desiring to be critical of the FBI.

On pages 116 and 17 appears information under a subheading
Name Check Requests. It is stated that White House aides serving under
Presidents Johnson and Nixon made numerous requests for name checks
of FBI files to elicit all Bureau information" on certain individuals.

’ unreliable, " reflects neither FBI policy nor FBI practice in dissemination
of information in Fedtral Employee Security cases. Infact, FBI
dissemination policy as set forth in the FBI Manual of Rules and
Regulations, Part Il, Section’5, and referred to in footnotes in Book I
on four separate instances, requires that standards of verification
or reliability be clearly pointed out. These four instances may be found
on pages 2, 3, 4 and 10 of Section 5. On page 4, there is specifically
spelled out the requirement, "in each instance every reasonable effort
should be made to provide additional descriptive information regarding
the source which will enable recipient agencies to intelligently evaluate
the information. * Further, we know of no standards by which we may
establish that information becomes worthless after a certain time.
instead, it is the relevance of the information and not its age that
governs the dissemination. Finally, the purpose of the Executive Order
involved is to authorize investigations of allegations that the conduct
of Federal employees or applicants does not meet the standards of the
Executive Order. No personnel action is possible without a thorough

, investigation of the allegations.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

NOTE:

This LHM is a compilation of data furnished by
personnel in the various substantive Headquarters sections and
divisions, which personnel have the expertise in the various
areas covered and reviewed the pertinent SSC reports. Refer
to page 21, paragraphs 3 and 4: Bringing to notice the correct
date of an SSC interview of William C. Sullivan (4/21/76), not
4/21/75, of considerable significance, per Assistant Director
Bassett. Contact with SSC Staff Member Johnston was by
S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project. Refer to page 22:
Former Soviet Section supervisor is Robert E. Lenihan, contacted
by Phillips. Significance of bringing to notice the inaccuracy
of the SSC claim that Lenihan had been charged with reviewing
all FBI files lies in our contention throughout our dealings
with the SSC of the impracticability of reviewing all FBI files
when responding to its requests.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

PURPOSE: To advise of "Departmental views" concerning

Tnformation in our files regarding associates of King and
how it is to affect our furnishing FBI documents to King
estate.

SYNOPSIS: We are negotiating with Department guidelines to
follow in preparing FBI documents for delivery to the King
estate. Guidelines incorporated into a Memorandum of Under-
standing (MOU) furnished to Department for Attorney General .
(AG) concurrence. Tentatively, privacy issue as to third ~.
parties to be handled by excising from documents derogatory
information but leaving names in. Discussion with Steve
Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination, revealed that certain information which FBI N
has traditionally included in documents relating to subversive ~
backgrounds of individuals because FBI considered such information
as derogatory, in a security sense, is not considered by Blackhurst
as derogatory. Blackhurst was advised that if we are to properly
process the documents for the King estate it will be necessary
for the Department to furnish a definition of "derogatory."
Blackhurst agreed, intends to confer with other Department
components and Bureau will be further advised.

ACTION: None. For information.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.
100-106670

DETAILS: By way of background, we are presently negotiating

with the Department guidelines for our implementation of an

AG instruction to furnish to the estate of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
copies of all FBI documents previously given to the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities. A principal element in
negotiations relates to what should and what should not be

excised from the documents prior ta delivery to the King estate
(classified information, identities of informants, etc.). The
attorneys on behalf of the King estate are Harry Wachtel and
Stanley David Levison who were advisors to King and who are
prominently mentioned in many of the documents involved. We

have been working with Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel
for Intelligence Coordination, and his assistant, Steve Blackhurst,
in arriving at guidelines to be followed in this project which
consists of our reviewing and processing for delivery about 2

to 2% file cabinet drawers of materials.

On 8/5/76 S. F. Phillips, INTD, who is coordinating
this matter, hand delivered to Blackhurst a Bureau letter to ~-
the AG cnd an accompanying MOU by which we intend to formalize
our negotiations and obtain the AG's concurrence with the MOU.
A critical item in the MOU relates to privacy and states that
names of ‘imdividuals other than'King will not be excised but
any derogatory information about them will be excised. Phillips
took the occasion of the delivery of the MOU to. raise with
Blackhurst possible special considerations concerning Wachtel
and LeVi'son inasmuch as they!are mentioned in documents and are
talso the King estate attorneys in this matter. Phillips inquired
as to whether their names and information about them should be
treated any differently in the processing of the King documents.
Blackhurst did not think so and discussion ensued as to type
of information concerning Wachtel and Levison appearing in the
documents. Phillips commented that some of the documents will
undoubtedly characterize Wachtel as having been a member of the
National Lawyers Guild, an organization cited as a communist
front by the former House Committee on Un-American Activities.
Blackhurst replied that such information should not be considered
as derogatory. Phillips then referred to the fact that Wachtel's
wife had once been reported to be a member of the Communist

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.
100-106670 :

Party and such might appear in the documents. Blackhurst
said that he recalled that such information is in some of
the documents but that, again, it should not be considered
as derogatory.

At this point Phillips told Blackhurst that he did
not intend to argue the merits of the position which we have
traditionally taken over the years in our security reporting;
namely, that such information as cited above is included
because it is considered derogatory, in a security sense.
Phillips pointed out that as there is such a wide variance
in understanding as to the meaning of "derogatory," the views
he just expressed versus Blackhurst's expression, it was
believed best that the Department define "derogatory" as it
is to be used in implementing the privacy aspects of the
documents. Blackhurst agreed and said he desired to confer
with Department experts in the Freedom of Information and
Privacy Acts fields and others. It was then agreed that the
Department, in responding to our letter to the AG asking for
concurrence with the MOU, would also furnish the necessary
definition of "derogatory" or other information to guide us
in processing the documents.

Another matter discussed with Blackhurst and on
which full agreement was reached concerned the fact that some
of the documents will contain material completely extraneous
to King. We will be excising such information from the
documents we process.

ADDENDUM: INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 8/9/76 SFP: vb.

The following information resolving the problem discussed
herein was telephonically furnished to SA Phillips by Mr. Blackhurst,
4:30 p.m., 8/6/76.

Blackhurst discussed the privacy issue problem and the matter
of "derogatory" material with other Departmental officials and, on their advice,
he telephoned Levison. Blackhurst told Levison that, normally, there would
be excised from the documents information which is of a personal nature or
derogatory, and that this would include information as to the personal life
of an individual and also concerning their political associations. It would
include information concerning a person belonging to a "far left" or "far
right" type organization and Blackhurst used as an example the Ku Klux Klan.
Blackhurst told Levison that some of the documents involved had information
concerning him, as well as concerning Mr. and Mrs. Harry Wachtel, and that
if information of a derogatory nature concerning these three individuals is
to be left in the documents, it would first be necessary for Levison/Wachtel
to furnish the Department a letter to that effect. Levison took the matter under
advisement and then called Blackhurst back and told him that the Nepartment
would receive a letter consenting to have the derogatory information concerning
Levison and the Wachtels left in the documents.

On the basis of the foregoing, Blackhurst advised Phillips that
we could go ahead with our project and to leave the derogatory information
concerning the three individuals in the documents unless-it called for excision
for such other reasons as classification or protection of sources. As to all
other third parties, Blackhurst advised that the Bureau could operate on
the basis of its traditional understanding of the term derogatory. The Bureau
will be furnished a letter from the Department indicating the AG's concurrence
with the MOU and advice concerning the written consent which the Department
is to receive.

PURPOSE s

To secure approval for expediting the deliveries to
the King estate of FBI commmications by excising classified
information from them rather than following full "classification
review" procedures.

SYNOPSIS:

We are initiating project in fulfillment of Attorney
General's (AG) instructions to furnish King estate all documents
concerning King previously given to the Senate Select Committee
(SSC). All classified information will be excised. Large volume
of material involved. As the AG has instructed expeditious
handling, we will work from material already segregated and -
maintained by SENSTUDY 75 Project. In connection with EO 11652
(Classification of National Security Information), processing
of material for dissemination under Freedom of Information and
Privacy Acts (FOI - PA) and other dissemination generally calls
for a "classification review" whereby every original document in
file is assessed for classification on a paragraph-by-paragraph
basis and appropriately marked, Because of expedite nature and
large volure of material in King estate request, we propose to
merely excise classified information from our copies of the
documents we gave to the SSC, rather than following full
“classification review" procedures.

100-106670

ACTION:

Upon approval, we will process the material for the
King estate as proposed by excising all classified information
rather than a full "classification review" of original documents.

DETAILS:

As you are aware, we are initiating a project whereby,
on instructions of the AG, we will be furnishing to the King
estate copies of all communications in our files concerning King
which we had previously furnished to the $5C. Procedures being
worked out with the Department to implement those instructions
include our excising, among other data, all information of a
classified nature. An extremely large volume of material is
involved as the SSC King inquiry was very broad and the Department
desires us to include considerable peripheral material in
responding to the King estate request. The AG hag asked that
this endeavor be expedited and that we make deliveries to the
King estate (through the Department) as we complete processing
of various segments of the whole.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Res Martin Luther King, Jr.
100-106670

In erder to readily identify the material we furnished
to the SSC concerning King, including the peripheral documents,
we will be using as a working base the copies maintained by the
SENSTUDY 75 Project. We will thus be able to bypass the very
time-consuming step of locating the originals of these documents
in our files. The Department is in agreement with our intention
to follow this procedure.

In connection with Executive Order 11652, we generally
follow the practica when making current dissemination (such as
under the FOI ~ PA and other types of dissemination) of making
a “classification review" of every document. This involves
locating the original documents in our files and making a
patagraph~by~paragraph assessment as to classification and
then adding the appropriate markings to the documents in file.
However, in order to expedite the processing of the voluminous
material involved for the King estate, we are proposing that
we merely excise the classified information from copies maintained
of the documents given to the SSG, rather than following full
“classification review" procedures involving original documents.

Reference is made to my memorandum of December 19,
1975, in which I advised you of a breach of confidentiality
in the handling of FBI documents delivered to the SSC. This
memorandum detailed the disclosure in the North Carolina Press
of former FBI informant George F. Dorsett, which disclosure y
was specifically attributed to documents delivered by this
Bureau to the SSC.

On February 6, 1976, the SSC held an Executive Session
concerning "Domestic Intelligence Investigations."' During the
course of the Executive Session several requests were made of
the Bureau personnel present. Among these was a request by
x) . Senator Robert Morgan for a detailed breakdown of payments
NMO@ made by this Bureau to George F. Dorsett, whom the Senator
~ “9 alleges to have been a Bureau informant reporting on the -
s ‘Os Ru Klux Klan. He also alleged that Dorsett was a "salaried 7

The Attorney General

Payments to Dorsett commenced January 30, 1959,
and lasted until April 29, 1970. During this period, he
was paid a total of $26,266.01 which consisted of $16,797.79
for services and $9,468.22 for expenses. An analysis of
these payments at FBI Headquarters roveals Dorsett was paid
on a "'cash-on-delivery" basis, and that these payments were
commensurate with the information he furnished.

: Dorsett's informant status has not been disclosed
| or acknowledged publicly by the FBI. Dorsett himself has
i persistently denied in public, his former role as a Bureau
informant. During an interview of Dorsett by FBI Agents on
December 12, 1975, he expressed concern for his personal
safety and for the safety of his family, based oa newspaper
articles which alleged his informant status. If information
regarding payments to Dorsett becomes available to the news
media, lt would confirm his informant status and further
jeopardize his safety.

Based on a previous agreement with SSC Staff
personnel, the FBI has not been required to divulge the
identity of any individual who served in an informant
status with this Bureau. In view of the above, the Bureau
feels it cannot respond to Senator Morgan's request, and
is forwarding a memorandum to the SSC explaining this
position.

The Bureau's reluctance in giving this information
is based on the need to protect the safety and well being
of those who have volunteered their services to assist
their country and the FBI.

the initials could lead to his identity, Further,
there is a Likelihood he was not a Section Chief

a Special Azent as B. B.; on pase 27 a footnote
contains the initials of a Special Agent as . S.3
and on page 29 footnotes contain the initials of
Special Agents B. K. and G. L. In xespect to

On March 31 and April 1 and 2, 1976, FBI

representatives also reviewed the SSC's draft report on

their names should, therefore, be deleted. Also, pages

By FBI memorandum dated March 26, 1976, certain
matters requiring the SSC's attention were brought to
notice concerning the SSC's draft report entitled
"Dr, Martin Luther King, Jr., Case Study."" On April 2, 1976,
the SSC made available its final draft report on this
matter for further review. It was noted that footnote
number 63 on page 110 still contained the name of former
FBI Special Agent William Stapleton which should be deleted

The Findings, which were in seven parts, were

On Friday, 7/9/76, EDS IONTGOMERY, retired reporter,
"San Francisco Examiner," called me. ie Said he had just
received a telephone call from a ROBERT} ERIEDMAN - of "Time
Magazine" in New York. FRIEDMAN told MONTGOMERY that he
had been going over Some of the Church Committee Reports
and that it was obvious that the FBILcin the past had "fed"
MONTGOMERY a considerable amount of information. MONTGOMERY
said FRIEDMAN indicated that the FBI had given MONTGOMERY
information regarding the Black Panther Party in Oakland. Fond
MONTGOMERY told FRIEDMAN that this was not true, that he :
received his information from the Sheriff's Office in Alaméda
County. FRIEDMAN also indicated that MONTGOMERY had received
information concerning ANGELA DAVIS and the guns used in

the Marin County shootout in which several people were - aa
killed. -MONTGOMERY told FRIEDMAN that this was not true, ; FWY
that he had received this information from the Marin County re
Sheriff's Office and that the FBI was not involved in this —_

case at that point but did later have an unlawful flight
warrant gn DAVIS, which resulted in her eventual arrest in

New York: Game FI - 1488 |

FRIEDMAN referred to several Caper incidents in
the Church Committee Report and indicated it was obvious to
him that the FBI had furnished the information to MONTGOMERY.
MONTGOMERY told him this was "a lot of garbage." MONTGOMERY
then asked FRIEDMAN if MONTGOMERY's name was mentioned in
the report as having received the information and FRIEDMAN

_ said it was not although FRIEDMAN drew the coneiysion that
“ it was cate i

MONTGOMERY again told FRIEDMAN that he had many,

volunteered to him by the FBI. MONTGOMERY commented that
FRIEDMAN obviously did not want to believe this.

PURPOSE: (1) To provide information concerning state

court subpoena for our records in connection with captioned
subject's trial and (2) to recommend Legal Counsel Division
prepare appropriate communication to the U. S. Senate pro-
testing activities of Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff

| member Arthur Jefferson who has involved himself on the

A PSE

side of Black Panther Party (BPP) subjects against the FBI
in legal proceedings in Los Angeles and Chicago.

&

SYNOPSIS: In a state court case in Los Angeles, California,
Involving Taylor, a former BPP member on trial for attempted
murder of a policeman in 1971, the defense has tried to
establish that the FBI's Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO)
harassed the defendant and caused him to commit the crime.

In its latest action the defense has subpoenaed 65 documents
from our Los Angeles and San Diego offices. Review of these

documents indicate they are all COINTELPRO related and subject
Taylor is not mentioned. Los Angeles and San Diego recommended
and FBIHQ concurs that these documents should not be produced
and the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) in Los Angeles
and the Department of Justice in Washington, D. C., are being
urged to resist production. Hearing is set for approximately
6/1/76. Defense in Taylor's case is using expert witness
testimony of Arthur Jefferson, reportedly an employee or in-
vestigator of the SSC who allegedly authored SSC report on
FBI harassment of BPP, particularly in California, SSC final
report dated 4/28/76, confirms Jefferson's connection with the
SSC. In addition, Jefferson is listed as witness for the
plaintiffs in the Iberia Hampton civil suit in Chicago and our
COINTELPRO efforts against the BPP have also been interjected
into this suit. Since Jefferson is apparently using information
obtained through his SSC work, an appropriate communication
should be sent to the U. S. Senate protesting his actions.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Harold Taylor
157=14077

RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) We are continuing efforts with the
Department and the AUSA, Los Angeles to resist producing
subpoenaed documents.

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division pre-
pare appropriate communication to the U. S. Senate protesting
the actions of Arthur Jefferson.

DETATLS :
Los Angeles Situation

Harold Taylor is one of three Los Angeles BPP
members on trial in the Superior Court in California for
attempted murder of a policeman on 9/10/71. Throughout the
trial the defense has attempted to establish that the FBI's
COINTELPRO harassed the defendants and caused them to
commit the crime.

On 5/24/76 Los Angeles advised that the defense
attorney in this case, Beth Lizsey has subpoenaed, and is
introducing the oral testimony of Arthur Jefferson. Jefferson
qualified as an expert witness on the basis of being an
investigator or employee of the SSC and reportedly authored
the Committee's report about alleged FBI harassment and
illegal activities against the BPP, particularly in California.
According to the prosecutor in the case, Jefferson's testimony
to date has been before the jury.

On 5/25/76 Los Angeles advised that a subpoena
duces tecum was received on 5/25/76 in the Taylor case and
| directed to Custodian of Records, FBI, Los Angéles and
San Diego Divisions. The ‘subpoena called for production of 25

Re: Harold Taylor

documents of the Los Angeles office and 40 documents of the
San Diego office. These documents were specifically identified
according to date and whether they were prepared at FBIHQ or
in the field. The subpoena states the documents are material
to the issue involved and relevant to the defense of Taylor,

a member of the BPP.

In its review of the list of documents Los Angeles
was able to identify 21 of the 25, all of which relate to the
BPP COINTELPRO file. The documents are of general nature
pertaining to the disruptive tactics against the BPP and none
mentioned Taylor. Similarly, San Diego determined all
communications located which were named in the subpoena
were in its COINTELPRO file and none contained any reference
to Taylor.

Los Angeles and San Diego recommended documents
not be made available to the defense and the Intelligence
Division and Legal Counsel Division concur. AUSA Dominick
Rubalcava, Los Angeles is handling this matter but to date
has been unsuccessful in contacting Departmental Attorney
Gordon Daiger, Washington, D. G., for his opinion regarding
production of the documents. Rubalcava stated he is making
no recommendations at this time pending discussions with
Daiger, but feels documents subpoenaed should not be made
available unless the entire trial would be jeopardized.
Rubalcava believes court appearances pertaining to production
of documents will not be scheduled until approximately 6/1/76.
He advised the defense counsel is utilizing expert testimony
of Arthur Jefferson who is testifying concerning FBI actions
undertaken nationwide to disrupt BPP activity.

On 5/26/76 Mr. R. F. Peterson of the Legal Counsel
Division contacted Daiger who stated he has not been in
contact with Rubalcava concerning the matter, Pending dis-
cussion with Rubalcava, Daiger will render an opinion
regarding production of the documents.

FBI employees, former employees and an informant

have been named as co-defendants in the case captioned

Re: Harold Taylor

civil action was brought by heirs of two BPP members killed
in a 12/4/69 shoot-out between BPP members in Chicago and
Chicago police officers assigned to the State's Attorney's
Office, Cook County, Illinois. Our COINTELPRO has been
interjected into this trial by the plaintiffs to the point
of alleging the shoot-out was a culmination of a series of
FBI COINTELPRO actions directed against the BPP,

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel on
Intelligence Coordination, Department of Justice, has
advised that according to Ed Christenberry, Departmental
Attorney handling the Hampton suit, Arthur Jefferson is listed
as a plaintiff witness in that trial. We have no indication
that Jefferson has testified to date. You will be advised of
further developments. :

Arthur Jefferson

SSC documents identified Arthur Jefferson as an SSC
counsel who in the final SSC report, dated 4/28/76, is listed
as Principal Staff Author of the Appendix entitled "The FBI's
Efforts to Disrupt and Neutralize the BPP.”

OBSERVATIONS: (1) We will continue our efforts with the AUSA
in tos Angeles and the Department to resist producing subpoenaed
documents: in the Taylor trial.

(2) Since documents listed in the Taylor case subpoena
are specifically identified, it appears Jefferson is capitalizing
on information he obtained in his SSC work relating to our
COLNTELPRO against the BPP and that Legal Counsel Division direct
appropriate communication to the U. S. Senate protesting
Jefferson's actions.

Senator Morgan was desirous of receiving the approval of
Mr. Levi for public release of certain documents concerning FBI
investigations of the Klan in North Carolina. These documents pertain
to efforts of an informant to charter a number of chapters after breaking
away from the main Klan organization, and would in all probability pin-
point the identity of the informant. The Senator also wanted certain

documents concerning Cointelpro activity against the Black Panthers OL

in North Carolina cleared for public release. LP

After much discussion, the Attorney General voiced
his great reluctance to in any way reveal the identity of an informant
even though the informant had publicly been identified by Senator Morgan
in speeches. Mr. Levi reminded the Senator of the procedures followed
by the Senate Committee and the agreement not to reveal informant
identities. Senator Morgan was unhappy with this position and feels that TH
North Carolina is being unfairly labeled by the FBI as the Klan capital eee
of the world when, in fact, much of the Klan activity and violence can be
attributed, according to Senator Morgan, to FBI informant activity. His
interest in releasing these documents stems somewhat from the fact that

| statements he has made concerning the Klan. He also allut
that many letters critical of him had been written by ex-Agents, which he
suspects may have been motivated by the Special Agent in Charge. He
stated these letters do not bother him, since they give him"tie-opportunity™
to strike back. 2 JUL 28 1976

Memorandum to Mr. Leavitt

Re: Request for Retention: of Xerox
Equipment for Use by Document
Classification Units

which the Bureau is involved, including the Socialist
Workers Party suit which recently necessitated the
Xeroxing of thousands of pages on an expedite basis.

The transfer of the Document Classification Office and
its related activities from the Inspection Division to
the Intelligence Division will add to the volume of work
being placed upon these machines, An increase in the
Freedom of Information Act requests and appeals also
ereates additional need for reproduction of documents.

Although it is impossible to determine with
any certainty the amount of documents which now need to
be reproduced, it is felt that the volume will be such
as to fully justify retention of the above-mentioned
machine, Additional information will be submitted as
the Division adjusts to the new work when a definite
volume can be predicted.

ACTION:

That the Xerox Model 7000 copying machine be
retained in the Intelligence Division.

Dear Mr, Levi: DATE BY

I would like to thank you for the courtesy you extended
by promptly responding to my request to see you. Your action
exemplified the spirit of cooperation between the Executive
and Congress which prompted my request.

I do feel that my concern that the FBI clear for release
the documents with which I was concerned deserves your seri-
ous attention. While E am aware that the release of the docu-
ments may confirm the identity of a former FBI informant, I
feel the posture the Bureau has taken in publicly denying that
the events described in the documents ever took place neces-
sitates their release, if only to set the record straight. It
should be noted that the Bureau's public position in this situ-
ation, as well as in others, has been taken in direct response
to public statements I have made critical of past improper FBI
activities. Accordingly, it is the confirmation of improper
FBI activity, instead of the identity of the informant, with
which I am concerned. Further, it is my feeling that, based
on information I have received, the identity of the informant
is already common knowledge. .

concern FBI actions taken against the Black Panther Party in
North Carolina. These in no way involve a confidential source,
| and I anticipate no problems with their clearance. Under sep-

The other group of documents for which I sought release

arate cover I am furnishing Mr. Steve Blackhurst copies of the
documents for which I seek clearance.

Again, let me express my appreciation to you for your as-
sistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

It is noted that Senator Morgan in his letter
points out that some of the documents he requests be
cleared for public velease pertain to the Black Panther
Party and do not appear to compromise an informant,
Senator Morgan's observation is correct, and these
documents could be excised for release without
compromising an informant. I feel, however, that to
accede to any part of the request is contrary to my
position that this request should be denied inasmuch as
it appears not to be within the scope of SSC business.

Reference is made to SSC request of Walter E.
Ricks, ILI, dated May 11, 1976, forwarding copies of FBI
documents which Senator Robert Morgan wishes to have
cleared for public release. Reference is also made to
Senater Morgan's letter to Attorney General Levi dated
May 11, 1976, pertaining to these same documents.

The requested clearance for release is not
being granted. it appears this request is a personal
request of Senator Morgan and not related to SSC
business. The SSG has conducted a thorough review
of FBI Counterintelligence Program activities relating both
to white hate and black hate groups and individuals. The
SSC has held public hearings, issued publie statements,
and prepared and released its reports covering these areas.
It is felt that the FBI should not agree to any further
public release of. documents in this area and that specifically
no such release should be approved for any request that is
not that of the SSG for SSC purposes.

Senator Morgan states in his letter to the
Attorney General, supra, that his purpose in requesting
the release of these documents “is the confirmation of
improper FBI activity." Your attention is invited to the
remarks of Director Kelley at Fulton, Missouri, on
May 8, 1976, in which he clearly acknowledged his
recognition of some past improprieties. It is felt that
statement is sufficient; we should proceed in a more positive
vein and nothing is to be gained by continued emphasis on and

disclosures of FBI past activities. 2

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Senator Morgan in his referenced letter states
regarding the possible disclesure of the identity of an
informant that it is his understanding that this informant's
identity is “already common knowledge." This informant's
public identification is based solely on unauthorized
disclosures that have been made in the North Garolina
press attributed to unnamed sources on the SSC and to
Senator Morgan. For the FBI to accede to the public
release of these documents would serve only to support
the prior wmauthorized disclosures of the identity of
a confidential informant. It is emphasized that the
disclosure of this or any FBI confidential source or :
confidential informant is considered a most serious breach of
gonfidentialiry.

- The Attorney Gerieral

NOTE:

U. S. Senator Robert Morgan of North Carolina, member —
of the SSC, has publicly criticized the FBI for its Counterintelli-
gence Program (COINTELPRO) actions directed against the klan and
the Black Panther Party (BPP) in North Carolina. Some documents
that were provided to the SSC, and relating to this area,lead to
the identity of a former klan informant. This informant has been
identified in the North Carolina press attributed to the SSC
and by Senator Morgan. On May 10, 1976, Senator Morgan and the
Attorney General, with respective assistants, and Associate
Director N. P, Callahan and Deputy Associate Director J. B.

Adams met. At that time Senator Morgan expressed his desire

to have documents released publicly which allegedly support

his contention that thé FBI has conducted itself improperly in

its investigation of the klan, particularly in North Carolina.

The Attorney General stated his reluctance to reveal in any -way
the identity of a confidential informant. The Attorney General
did advise Senator Morgan that we would review the documents and
the Attorney General would inform Senator Morgan of his decision
regarding their release. Senator Morgan has requested of the
Attorney General that we grant approval for public release of
documents allegedly supporting Senator Morgan's allegations of
FBI misconduct. These documents include those that identify this
informant, We are recommending to the Attorney General that the r
quest be denied inasmuch as it appears to be a personal request
of Senator Morgan and not a request of the SSG and that the SSC
has prepared and released its report on COINTELPRO activities

The Attorney General

December 20, 1975, issue of the '\’inston-Salem Chronicle,"
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Little is quoted as being
aware of the Freedom of Information Act as a means of
obtaining material from FBI files.

Mr. Blackhurst advised that he desires to have
available as many options as possible for consideration in
responding to this matter. Accordingly, he requested that
these documents be reviewed and excised for public release
if this option should be chosen.

Enclosed herewith is one set of the documents
that has been excised and one set that is not excised, but
is red-lined to show what excisions have been made.

I would appreciate your advising me of the action
taken in response to this matter.

Intelligence Coordination

NOTE: This is to accomplish delivery of excised documents to
Mr. Blackhurst in accordance with his request as set forth above.

form originally turned over to the SSC identified a Charlotte

were considered collectively. The documents have been excised
extensively and the informant's identity can no longer be
established from the documents if approved for public release.

accumulated 9 thick foldeiss containing newspaper and wire service >
clippings plus some additional material such as magazine articles~S
and other public source data. Material maintained in tickler f
folders, Sub A file was never opened, Retained material is in «,
general, but not precise chronological order. With the end of a
the SSC mandate and issuance of its final report, it is S\
believed we should now provide for the final and ‘permanent,
retention of this material.

This matter was discussed by writer with Messrs.
W. L. Bailey and L. W. Brady of the Records Management Division
on 6/29/76 and it was agreed that the most practical manner of
handling would be to file this material as a bulky enclosure
behind file and that no indexing would be necessary. Further,
| that the original of this memorandum be filed in the main
| SENSTUDY 75 file, 62-116395, and a copy be filed in Sub A
to 62-116395 which should be opened as a repository of it alone.
The presence of a copy of instant memorandum in the Sub A will
serve as a permanent flag advising where the material is actually
filed.
