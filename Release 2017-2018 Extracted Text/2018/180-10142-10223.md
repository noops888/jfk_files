In the Summer of 1960, Ray was actively recruited

by the CIA to become a member of the ERD, approaches being

made through Raul Chibas. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol I) Ray's back-

ground was questioned by the State Department. (CIA/DDO Ray

international Communism and he is interested in strengthening

ties between Cuba and U.S. (CIA/DDO, Ray VOl I, (PRQfOrM, Part 2)

Not everyone in the CIA who knew Ray were in agreement

with this assessment. In a Memo for Record dated 11/21/60,

it was reported that, "...Ray did not politically represent

anything to cheer about." (CIA/DDO Ray Vol II, Memo for Record,

11/21/60, Subject: Meeting with King and Esterline on Subject

of Handling MRP) Another CIA officer who met privately with

Ray in November 1960 stated that his political posture was

doubtful as far as U.S. Government acceptance is concerned.

Still another Memo for Record states that Ray's action all

seemed directed toward making him the future power in Cuba

rather than overthrowing Castro. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol V, Memo

for Record, 2 June 1961, Subject: Relations with Manolo Ray

and the MRP from (James A. NOel)

The memo further pointed out

that it was believed Ray was so far "left" in his thinking

that he would be as dangerous (or more so in the long run)

to U.S. interests as Castro, if he ever got to be a power in

Cuba. (Ibid)

Ray made his polftical position very clear during a

private meeting with a ClA Officey on November 15, 1960. (CIA/DRO,

also stated that Ray was bitterly anti-American as well as

probably totalitarian in his thinking. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol IV,

Memo to S - Dr. Berle from ARA - Philip W. Bonsal, March 16, 1961,

resisted joining the CRC because he felt the members were

too restrained and he did not want to become a part of a

situation in which someone else was running the show for the

exiles. (HSCA #089005, Memo to G. Robert Blakey, 6/28/78,

The Western Hemisphere division of the CIA received

word in April 1964 that in the late 1940's, Ray had been

closely associated

with a known Puerto Rican Communist and

was friendly with the Puerto Ricans who were working on the

rennovation of the White House and the group that tried to

assassinate President Truman. (CIA/DDO, Ray - Assorted
