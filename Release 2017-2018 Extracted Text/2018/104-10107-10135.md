MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.

Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications

of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.

It was concluded that additional information was required on

and

§ I contacted the Director

of Security and requested the security files on these two individuals

and was advised that we could not have the security files but that

Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss

their contents openly.

03

on

p 200 January, MI. Greene brought the security files

and was most cooperative in explaining

their contents.

Attached is a chronological rundown on the

pertinent information on

affiliation with

the FBI, CIA and Itkin.

3. On 30 January a meetine was held With Messrs. Houston,

4 The facts in the attached chronology are subject to

question since they are the result of

own explanation of

his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from

independent sources. The most critical aspect would appear to

be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

affiliation with CIA.

This knowledge is borne out by

the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly brings

name

into the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations.

One of the questions to be answered by LPGLOBE personnel is

whether or not

reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,

Switzerland, in March 1966. '

There appears to be no record of

having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or

what his financial contribution was to the

5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI

that the New-York District Attorney may be considering prosecution

against

for having absconded with funds received from

negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate

the likelihood of criminal prosecution. It may be necessary to

discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

6. With regard to

there appear to have been

two operational considerations, one having been a request to use

him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February

1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations

Division for his use on Project WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO

Division advised Security that

was not going to be used

on WUBRINY. Mi. Rocca commented that there are some rather

ominous allegations against members of the firm of

indicating that one member of the firm was a cara

arryng member of the Communist Party. At the present time

MI. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr.
