MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
Bane TURN TO CIA
: i ground U;
SUBJECT: Herbert Itkin Do Not Reproduce”

1. A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.
Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications
of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.
additional information was required on
nm I contacted the Director
of Security and requested the security files on these two individuals
and was advised that we could not have the security files but that
Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss
their contents openly,

on Bat and was most cooperative in explaining

their contents, “Attached is a chronological rundown on the

4, The facts in the attached chronoloy are subject to
question since they are the result of own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources. The most critical aspect would appear to

be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

(pj

affiliation with CIA. This knowledge is borne out by
"the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly bring: name
into the story which Itkin develops about his CLA affiliations.
One of the questi be. answered by GPGLOBE personnel is
whether or no: reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,
Switzerland, in March 1966, There appears to be no record of
aving explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or

what his financial contribution was to the|

5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI
that the_New. York District Attorney may be considering prosecution
agains for having absconded with funds received from
negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution, It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

6. With regard t there appear to have been
two operational considerations, one having been a request to use
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations

Division for his use on Project WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that as not going to be used

on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca comniénted that there a
ominous allegations against members of the firm oi bS
indicating that one member of the fir =

carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr.
