LA 4410-C-TE was interviewed on 3/11/64 by SAs

GORGE B. BLAND and JAMES I. BRINI, and advised as follows: V

He left Los Angeles with his wife on 1/7/64, and

drove straight through to Chicago, which departure was

caused by information he received

concerning a judgement about

to be rendered against his brother for $3, 300.00 which actually

was the responsibility of the informant. U

When he arrived at Chicago, he contacted his attorney

MIKE KACHIGAN in regard to this matter. In conversation

with his attorney he was told by him as well as another

attorney in the same office, MIKE LEVIN, that a contract was

out for informant and neither attorney expected to see him

alive when he appeared in their office.

According to LEVIN,

he heard from an

someone at a party that a contract was out

to k111 informant. V

During informant's stay in Chicago, from shortly

after 1/7/64, to sbortly before his arrival back in Los

Angeles on 3/5/64, he learned the following: U

From several sources he considers knowledgeable,

he was told that the victim (CHARLES WILLIAM BRAY) in the

Miami prosecution of ALDERISIO has been straightened out and

that they have got to him and he will not stand up for the

government and

testify. V

Also that SAM GIANCANA is no longer the

Chicago but has stepped aside and MILWAUKEE PHIE" ALDERISIO

has taken over from GIANCANA as the boss.. Informant con-

siders the sources of the above information to be knowledgeable. u

In order to handle his brother's case, informant

found it necessary to be in the Cook County Clerk's Office

as well as the State Attorney's Office and commented that no

one will check a record or do anything for you without $2.00

being paid to them.

In this instance, informant said he

was

handing out five and ten dollars and sometimes more to

numerous people in order to get the necessary records.

this regard, he talked to a Deputy Sheriff named SAMUEL PEVIN

who serves subpoenas and who recently had a heart attack.

PEVIN was one of the people who said that

"they" had gotten

to BRAY in Miami. PEVIN was selling Papermate or Scripto,

but believed to be Papermate, ball point pens that retail for

$1.98 for 40f a piece and he had hundreds of them.

PEVIN

explained that there were 350,000 such pens stolen from a

traller and they are being sold all over Chicago for 30€ and

40€ a piece.

PEVIN also advised informant that he had

stolen Admiral portable television sets for $40.00 a piece

as well as stolen Norelco electric shavers for a very good

price.

In regard to MANNY SKAR, informant said that ROCKY

DE STEFANO is behind SKAR and they got $300,000 net from the sale of

Sahara Inn North, Chicago.

Also that they want to buy back

the sahara Inn that they sold to GeNe AUlry and, according

to informant, this may possibly explain the bombings of the

Sahara. v

that recently closed in Chicago; however, informant does not

believe MEDLEVINE lost anything since they probably were

stealing off the top. Informant understands that MEDLEVINE

is coming back to Los Angeles to get into another operation.

Informant was asked if he knew DENNIS STEIN, who

is known to have been recently closely associated with SKAR

in Los Angeles. Informant recalled a DANNY STEIN, who was an

auctioneer from New York who may be identical since his:

description is similar. V

In regara to the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada,

it is informant's understanding that the

Chicago outfit owns

this hotel. Informant produced a card reflecting the name

Of FRED FRIEDMAN whom he described as former manager at the

Riviera Hotel and was kicked öut broke some time ago, and

came to him about a year ago looking for a job in the vend-

ing machine business.

At that time, FRIEDMAN's Los Angeles

phone number was WE. 1-9090.

Informant believes that FRIEDMAN,

who.

he knows deeply resents his treatment by the hotel

owners, might talk about

. the operation of the Riviera Hotel. J

Informant also mentioned that he has seen JACK FOX

(PCI) and he is real sick.

FOX's son BILLY, informant under-

stands, is tied up with FRED SICA.

InK LAWRENCE ROTHBARD, PO 1-6024:

MURRAY HUMPHREYS man. V

The above information is set out for the information

of the Bureau, Chicago, and Miami captioned with the informant's

symbol number in the interest of brevity since it relates to

various matters concerning his recent visit to Chicago.

Additional information concerning this trip will be reported

as received Irom the informant. U

Los Angeles is considering the Miami ALDERISIO

case RUC..
