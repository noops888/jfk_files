JOSE M. R. FUENTEVILIA GIL advised on 7/3/62,

that until 6/30/62, he was Secretary of the Cafe D'Artist

Cap., which corporation operates the Cafe D'Artist Night

Club in Miami. FUENTEVILLA said he was a journalist in

Cuba and because of this, he was

requested by OTTO SIRGO

and CAESAR ALOUYO, President and Vice President of the

corporation, to become Secretary of the corporation, and

handle the publicity for the night club. FUENTEVILLA said

he had nothing to do with the actual operation of the Cafe

D'Artist, and, therefore, knew little about the financial

operations.

He stated he knew the subject in Cuba as he

handled publicity for the Sans Souci Hotel, in which the

subject operated the casino.

FUENTEVILLA said he has seen

the subject three or four times in Miami, but knew nothing
