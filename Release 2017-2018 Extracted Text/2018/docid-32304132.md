Office Memorandum â€¢ UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO

DIRECTOR, FBI

KOM

: SAC, ALBUQUERQUE (137-651)

SUBJECT: RACKETEERING ACTIVITIES BY

MEMBERS OF

LEAMSTERS UNION

LOCAL 299;

INFORMATION

CONCERNING

Enclosed herewith are four copies of a blind memo

containing information concerning activities of certain

members of the Teamsters' Union, Local 299, Detroit, Mich.,

during the approximate period 1952 through 1955.

This information was voluntarilly furnished by

GEORGE EDGAR COUTTS, a PCI of this office, to SA JOHN B.

O'LEARY.

COUTTS had been reading an article in the Albu-

guerque Journal of 8/22/58, concerning the appearance of

BARNEY BAKER before the Senate Rackets Investigating/Com-

mittee and stated, as he had been a member of the Teamsters'

Union, Detroit, he would like to make available some in-

formation concerning the Teamsters' Union activities.

COUTTS is

aware of the fact that the FBI does not

investigate labor activites as such, but realizes his in-

formation was voluntarilly made available. He thought

perhaps the Bureau might be interested in receiving such

information and might desire to make it available to the

Senate Committee investigating illegal activities in the

various Unions.

ASCA

The enclosed is being furnished for the Bureau's

information.

This PCI is not available for testifying before

a Committee or Hearing Board.
