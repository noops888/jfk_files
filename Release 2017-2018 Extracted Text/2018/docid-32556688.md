GUS ALEX ao
ANT I-RACKETEER ING ‘|

Reurtel 10/4/65,

Your suggestion that action be initiated to have Swiss
authorities require Alex to submit affidavit relative to his
presence in Switzerland is being held in abeyance pending the
receipt of informtion which Legat Bern has requested from Swiss
authorities concerning this matter,

Note: Chicago hoodlum Gus Alex and his paramour visit Switzerland
each winter on vacation and Legat Bern has established appropriate
coverage in past years through Swiss authorities. Following last
visit of Alex during past winter Swiss authorities issued a prohibition
against Alex's re-entry into the country on the basis that he was an
mndesirable, Alex has appealed and Swiss police now advise they

‘feel there is some question of identity as to whether there are

two persons by the name of Gus Alex involved and have requested futher
‘verification concerning this. Legat has requested Swiss authorities
to furnish information as to reason why they believe two different
persons by the name of Gus Alex are involved, Chicago suggests that
since evidence of Alex's presence in Switzerland is conclusive that
contact be made with Swiss officials to require Alex to furnish
affidavit denying his presence in Switzerland.

Chicago being advised that this will be held in abeyance
pending receipt of requested information by Legat Bern.
