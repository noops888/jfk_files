Marina and Lee Harvey OSWALD

The subject of the OSWALDs was introduced into the
interrogation during a discussion about the difficulty a
Soviet citizen, who marries a foreigner, encounters in
attempting to @ the USSR if the KGB chooses (for some
reason) not to permit the Soviet citizen to emigrate.

Subject stated that it goes without saying that prior to
receiving KGB's sanction not a single Soviet citizen, whether
he or she is married to a foreigner, would be allowed to
leave the USSR,

Asked if the case of Marina OSWALD's departure from
the Soviet Union was typical, Subject replied that her
departure from the Soviet Union was neither typical nor usual,
particularly in view of the fact that her husband, Lee Harvey
OSWALD, was a very strange individual, He had been in Cuba,
and then came to the Soviet Union not as a tourist, but as
an American defector who renounced his American citizenship
and attempted to become a Russian citizen. This in itself
4s. unusual for an American - it is not typical and very rare
for an American to do so, and Subject believed that an
American doing what OSWALD did (seeking Soviet citizenship
and jouncing American citizenship) could only do so because

“he was a traitor,

In answer to a request for his opinion regarding the
OSWALD case, Subject said that all of his information was based
only on what was known to everyone who read the newspapers
after. the KENNEDY assasination and on what he read in a con=
densed version of. the rren Report while he was in Western
Europe, When pressed for his personal opinion he said it was
a very unusual situation, Normally a Soviet citizen (like
Marina) would not be allowed to leave the Soviet Union, in ~
fact the Soviet authorities would try in some way to convince
the citizen not to leave. However, if a Soviet married a
foreigner, and insisted on leaving he or she could always, as
a last resort, be refused an exit visa. “There have been
cases where a Soviet citizen married a foreigner and received
an exit visa, howe the Soviet thorities

that the foreign spouse may have had some influence, and could
have created adverse publicity for the Soviet Government had
the exit visa not been granted, This was definitely not so

in OSWALD's case, OSWALD could not insist that Marina be
granted an exist visa since he was not in a position to do so,
and. consequently the Soviet authorities were not compelled to
do so unless they specifically wanted to let her go to America
with OSWALD.

When asked to still further elaborate on his beliefs
regarding the case, Subject stated that in this case (OSWALD's),
Subject couldn't guess, and in order to come to any kind of a
valid conclusion he would have to know something (factual),
which he doesn't, His opinion, however, is strictly an
opinion without any basis or fact, He thinks that KGB was
definitely interested in OSWALD while the latter resided in the
USSR, To presume that OSWALD could have lived in the Soviet

Union as a simple American is excluded, Subject believes that

the KGB kept OSWALD in "their field of vision" and
undoubtedly worked with him, To Subject it is unthinkable
that the KGB would miss such an opportunity, since it
always considers using persons (such as OSWALD) for work
either directly in intelligence, as an agent, or in any
other way "to inflict damage to the West*.

Asked whether the assaNnation of President KENNEDY
could -be ‘considered as "being damaging to the West", Subject
answered in the affirmative, 5

Subject explained that the existence of a government
such as-the United States is a threat to the Soviet regime,
The United States is an example to the rest of the world

| (Soviets: included) that people can live, survive, and have
a higher standard of living in a democracy, Therefore, the
Soviet Union tried, and tries, to cut the U.S. Government
down at every opportunity. Since President KENNEDY was locked
upon by many, in: the Soviet Union as a popular personality,
KENNEDY's. personal attraction further raised this feeling
that living-in a democracy had its benefits, to an even higher
level with the general population of the Soviet Union.

When asked. if it was possible that KGB could or: would
ever sanction such an operation (the assasination) Subject
answered "yes, at that time (KHRUSHCHEV's) it could hav
KBRUSHCHEV. was considered by Subject to.be an ignorant _ é
individual who was willing to take risks and adventurous under- =,
takings.- Subject said, bowever, that this could never occur C)
under the present.Soviet leadership. Subject considered that Ean
the decision to carry out such an operation, (the assasination)
could not have been made by the Chairman of the KGB since he
does not possess such authority, and, therefore, could only — l
have been made by KHRUSHCHEV himself. [>

“Subject was asked 4f such an operation might not have :
-Anvolved a terrific risk which could have possibly resulted :
in an armed conflict between the two nations, had Soviet -
involvement been proven by the Americans, Subject felt that 5
even if the Americans did accuse the Soviet Government of
complicity in the assasination, the Soviet Government would
certainly deny such an American accusation, claiming that the

‘ Americans were using OSWALD, a crazy man who had been in the
Soviet Union, would say that the accusation was a provocation,
and in all probability would repudiate such American claims.

To underline his point, Subject mentioned that even :
though OSWALD was.in the Soviet Union, and was suspected we
because. he was.in Cuba, nothing happened and the Soviet Union
wasn't accused by the Americans,
