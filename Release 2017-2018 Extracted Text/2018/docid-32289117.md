Permit me to inform you on the results of
the assignment given to me and Captain Antonio. Olmos
Del Moral at Ciudad Mante, Tamaulipas Plaza, May 2, 1967.(S}

I. Background Information.(5)

As is already known, the Secretary of the
Government, through the (Mexican) Federal Security
Police (D.P.S.), requested the cooperation of the technical
personnel of this Department in the finding, identifying
and destruction of some "bombs," detonators and other
devices which, according to information obtained by the
D.F.S., had been brought into the country and buried at 5
a spot near the Mante-C. Victoria road, between kilometers
643 and 644.5)

II. Location of the Zone a Spot Where the
Explosives Were Found.(§ )

As a result of the above request, the under-
signed and Captain Olmos, accompanied by two agents of
the D.F.S., went immediately to Ciudad Mante, Tamaulipas,
and arrived at said plaza at 3:20 A.M., May 8, 1967 ‘S) §

On the same day, at 8:00 A.M., we went to the
indicated spot, between kilometers 643 and 644, for the
purpose of determining the indicated zone wheré, according
to the information, was located the spot where the
explosives had been buried.(S) ae

At the end of four hours, we succeeded in
finding the exact spot where the explosives had been
buried, in a promontory bordering the left side of the
road and approximately 15 meters from the road, between”
kilometers 642 and 643. The location is shown on
Photographs No. 1 and 2.($)

2) Four magnets, consisting of coiled

wrapped in sections of an inner tube. (6)

3) The detonators for the explosive charges.
These were found wrapped in a plastic bag. Photograph

4) The remnants of an explosive charge.
It is thought that farmers in the area accidentally
discovered it and, in attempting to see its contents,
destroyed it completely. Photograph No. 8.6)

unearthed, we proceeded to examine them in detail in
order to attempt to identify them and ascertain as to
what condition they were in so.as to destroy them,

a) The Explosive Charge - Rectangular in
shape with the following approximate dimensions: 30 x 20
x 7 centimeters, The charge consists of a block of
explosive covered with a solid, putty-like plastic
material, the entire surface of which is covered with
black insulation tape. At one of its edges, 2 plugs
for an iron pipe of 3/4 inch diameter were found. ‘These ©
are fastened separately by a screw to lengths of galvanized
iron pipe of the same diameter and a proximately 15
centimeters long. The pipes are located inside the
explosive charge and serve as a lodging for the detonators.
Two metallic rods of 7 millimeters in diameter and 10
centimeters long extend along the longitudinal axis of
the charge. They have screws at the ends which serve
to fasten them to the spools. ‘S)

The explosive inside is white in color and
plastic-like. Its characteristics and potency are unknown
It will be necessary to conduct analyses to determine
its class and type.() ®@

It was ascertained that the explosive charge
( was not assembled and ready for detonation, since it did
not contain the proper elements for starting, propagating

b) Spools-magnets - There are four of them, i
and they consist of spools of approximately 3 x 2x1
inches, containing at their ends two metallic plates
fastened by bolts. Each of these plates has a bore hole bd
into which the small rods used to hold the charge are
placed. On the side opposite that containing the bore
hole, there is a metallic plate whose function is to
serve as the surface which is connected by the magnet
to any metallic surface. Photograph No. 1@

Detonators - The detonators are of the
percussion type and apparently are activated by an
electric current. They have an approximate lengths)

explosive covered with a solid, putty-like plastic
material, the entire surface of which is covered with
black insulation tape. At one of its edges, 2 plugs
for an iron pipe of 3/4 inch diameter were found. These
are fastened separately by a screw to lengths of galvanized
