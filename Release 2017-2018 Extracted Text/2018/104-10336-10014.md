Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)! and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

CIA-IR-12 Contacts with Journalists or Publishing Houses.

The Review Board seeks to determine to what extent, if any, CIA might have
attempted to influence any journalists or publishers regarding public discussion
of the assassination. This request, originally discussed in March 1997, was raised
at the DO follow-up briefing on April 1, 1997. CIA has had no response and no
time frame for a response.

CIA-IR-13 Office or Person Dealing with Organized Crime and Cuba.

The Review Board requested that CIA make a particular personnel file available.
The file was made ‘available by CIA for review. The Review Board seeks a full
and accurate formal response to this request detailing any and all searches made
and the results of those searches. Once a formal statement is provided, this
request will be complete. :

CIA-IR-14 Breckinridge Files.

“CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City Station.

CIA (OGC) will determine the disposition of the files of Scott D. Breckinridge.
CIA has had no response and no time frame for a response.

The Review Board has for some time been attempting to determine whether it
has had access to all of CIA’s surveillance “take” from the Cuban and Soviet
facilities in Mexico City at the time of the Oswald visit and in the immediate
wake of the assassination. On numerous occasions, the Review Board has asked
whether there was any surveillance take in addition to what is currently in the
collection. i

On March 18, 1997, the Review Board provided additional leads tg CIA to assist
it in answering these questions. The DO has agreed to check Headquarters
records for the file referenced in HMMW 12454, to search for the crypts cited in
this document, and to search for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches
cited in this document.

In addition, the DS&T will query its offices for possible records on Mexico City
and Cuba and for the present location of Staff D records. Regardless of the

plots. The Review Board will provide possible search query suggestions from
the 1967 IG Report.

CIA-IR-18 DO Office.

The Review Board has requested orally information about a particular DO office.
Since January 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a response.

CIA-IR-19 Computer Searches.

Dear John:
As you are aware, there has been a great deal of interest surrounding the reported trip
of accused assassin Lée Harvey Oswald to Mexico City in September and October of

1963. Information that‘has now been publicly released reveals that CIA had in place
several surveillance operations targeting Cuban and Soviet facilities or personnel in
Mexico City. For more one year, the Review Board staff has attempted to ascertain
to what extent CIA’s recor lated to this surveillance are complete.

It is our goal to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that we have identified and
reviewed all documentation and dperational reports relating to all telephone, electronic,
and photographic surveillance the CLA\jad targeting the Soviet and Cuban establishments in
Mexico City from September 1963 througt: December 1963 (hereinafter “Surveillance
Operations”). Although we are awarethat the HSCA requested records on the
Surveillance Operations, the records in the Sequestered Collection now appear to us to
be somewhat incomplete and somewhat inconsistent. We would like to assemble as
complete a collection as possible of all types ef reporting vehicles used by the Mexico
City Station and Headquarters regarding the Surveillance Operations. We are also
trying to reconcile possible gaps in operational activity and operational reporting, and
in order to do so would like to review all logs pertaining to these operations and all
original negatives from the photo surveillance operatjons.' Therefore, we wish to pose
a series of questions and request for records.

LILYRIC were never made available to any of the investigative commistigns in the past.

In addition, we request reports in the project and related files that make reference to
activities during September and October 1963. In requesting these files, we are asking
the CIA to conduct new and comprehensive searches of Agency files which go beyond
what is contained in the Sequestered Collection. This request should be interpreted in
its broadest sense and extended to include any other surveillance operations that were
targeted against the Soviet and Cuban installations during the time of Oswald's visit.
For example, if there were additional TSD operations, wiretapping, microphone
surveillance (bugs), or technical surveillance other than those listed above, we request
any files and/or logs that exist on such.

In the event that any file has been destroyed, we request that all information pertaining
to such destruction be provided. .We anticipate that the results of these searches and a
written explanation of missing material will be included in the Agency’s Final
Compliance Statement.

In requesting access to these materials, we are not designating them “assassination
records” as of yet. Nor are we, at this time, requesting that copies be given to the
Review Board.

We would appreciate your response by March 7, 1997. If this does not provide you
with sufficient time, please let us know, in writing, by what date you believe you will
be able to respond to this request.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

On CIA’s Electronic “Take” in Mexico

The following is a partial response to referent
request.

The Agency has made specific searches for files
referenced in HMMW 12454 and for files on the crypts cited
therein. It has also searched for HMMA 20307 and other
ydispatches and cables cited in the document. The crypts

pr within HMMW 12454 are the more generic crypts for telephone
yn tap operations and not those of the operations extant in
Mexico City during the periods asked about, namely the time

v Xe of Oswald's visit and the period following the assassination
oe of President Kennedy. Our best judgment is that the
- dispatch was written in haste and in truncated language
o we without correct knowledge of the operational crypts for
. specific operations in Mexico city.
Zo
The DDS&T search for records resulted in the Mexico
City September, October and November 1963 Operational

are in the sequestered collection. We are awaiting their
response on Staff D records.

In addition, the Final Declaration should confirm whether or not CIA has saved any
1963-64 files of the Mexico City Station (and certain files from another station). If those
files have not been retained, please confirm that fact in the Final Declaration. To the
extent those files have been archived, however, then please confirm that they have been
examined for the purpose of determining whether they contain assassination records.

We recommend that CIA identify more specifically the CIA files that have been, or will
be, placed in the JFK Collection at NARA. Although we leave this to CIA’s discretion,
we recommend that, to the extent practicable, CIA attach a non-classified listing of the
files encompassed within the CIA-~HSCA Sequestered Collection.: We believe that an
identification of the files within the CIA-HSCA Sequestered Collection will demonstrate
the breadth and variety of assassination records being made public by the CLA.

3. CIA Should Specifically Account for Certain Important Record Groups,

Including Any Destruction of Assassination Records

We request that CIA, in its Final Declaration, account for any important records
regarding the assassination that may h4ve been destroyed or that otherwise cannot be
located.

For example, CIA has reported that the original surveillance tapes that recorded thé
Oswald telephone conversations with the Cuban Consulate and Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City were destroyed, and that CIA has no copies of these audio recordings.
However, CIA apparently has preserved certain recordings from Mexico City that post-
| date the assassination (see J A.2 of this letter). We assume that CIA will provide a
i complete accounting for these records in its resporise to Review Board request CLA-IR-
15, which relates to CLA’s “electronic take” from Mexico City for the relevant time
period. That response should be attached to the Final Declaration (CIA may also want
to attach any formal explanation of this issue that it previously provided to the HSCA).
We want to ensure that CIA explains the circumstances for the destruction of the audio
recordings of the Oswald telephone calls in Mexico City, confirms that no copies of this
audio surveillance has been retained by CIA, and gives a full accounting of the post-
~ assassination Mexico City tapes. aed

RE rat 17 September 1998

MEMORANDUM FOR: Ms. Laura Denk
Executive Director, ARRB

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
Senior Reviewer

SUBJECT: Re: ARRB Request CIA-IR-15, For Information
On CIA‘s Electronic *Take*” in Mexico

1. The following is in response to referent request.

2. Over the years, there have been a number of efforts
to determine if any electronic surveillance audio tapes made
during the period Oswald visited Mexico (26 September - 2
October 1963) still existed. The Directorate of Operations
has again made a thorough search of its records system as
well as the index to retired records trying to locate any
such tapes or documentation which would shed light on their
disposition. In addition, the Agency has discussed this
question with operational experts whose professional opinion
is that, most likely, the tapes in question were recycled
for further use and never sent to headquarters for
retention. The normal operating practice within the Mexico ae
City station was to recycle audio surveillance tapes after
transcribers had listened to them and made transcripts of
those parts with intelligence value.

3. With respect to the issue of messages between
Mexico City and CIA headquarters which referred to “tapes”
being sent, we offer the following. Messages between field
stations and headquarters use operational jargon and
shortened sentence structures that can sometimes cause
misunderstandings. Our best judgment is that those
references within field messages which referred to “tapes”
being sent really intended “transcripts” of, or
“information” from, audio surveillance tapes, not the actual
tapes.

4. In addition to the above, there is a possible
explanation for the personal recollections of some people
about tapes being sent to headquarters. During the DO
search for the tapes in question, it located approximately
185 audio surveillance tapes of the Soviet and Cuban
facilities in Mexico City for the period 22 November 1963 to
early January 1964 -- the day of and the days immediately
following the assassination. These tapes have been declared
assassination records and are being processed for release to
the National Archives.


5. In conclusion, based on the search efforts that
were undertaken and the studied opinions of operational
experts who were consulted, the Agency is satisfied that the
audio surveillance tapes made during Oswald’s visit to
Mexico do not exist and almost certainly were recycled in

the normal course of business before their potential value
was known.

6. This concludes the Agency’s action on CIA-IR-15.
If you have any question about his matter, please advise.

Jd. Barry Harrel,
