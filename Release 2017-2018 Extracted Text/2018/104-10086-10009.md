Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 ‘until |

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in |

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (upstaged of multiline

telephone company w ater by a Station case officer. The number

of Tines tapped wa ted only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of Tangauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican=

- American recruited agents.

- Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

+ assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
Operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double Taned

Street on the southeast corner of’ that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the Photograph of the “unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bul Fe middle of

This site overlooked the 8 of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this oro SNS to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three Photographic sites were managed by a re~
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American nother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a veek. The film was'then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

Processed on the outside by a recruited agent. ~

Nobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers. |
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
“which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for '

identification purposes. «“
The Station also conducted a unilateral 1 Gant operation,

2. Liaison Covera: caw
Liaison cov we unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction
of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and contro? of
foreigners. Their agents were sielexteZinls and corrupt. A Station
officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

Operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines
Connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican
Army officers. In 1961, because. of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-
Cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
Post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post.
3. Qswatd Coverage:
In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

Joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the AJENVQY 1istening
Post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, capa Sete ite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible ak Mest ation immediately

that they would not be disc eo the Mexicans hooked up their

Soviet lines, three Czeth lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
Tine. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which‘were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transTa-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here a ms there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three aS a week

There was some delay because Station personne} waited to compare the
Photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in
either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only |
these two Tanguages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.
