MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WHD for Cuba i
SUBJECT 3 Espinoga Allegations

1. Sensitivity: Regardless of accuracy, they

A. present a problem because of their having been
Presented to other government agencies;

B. in view of matters touching on U.S. security, '
are delicate and could have unfavorable repercussions
if repeated to newsnen by the complainant or his
associates (whose independent, previous threats were
of greater potential embarrassment);

Cc. affect tl ations and the security of our
personnel] at id

2. Action: In view of the foregoing, the allegations

ato

A. should be put in proper perspective - i.e., not
ignored because of the potential embarrassment but
considered in the light of what we already know .
(Alsovt all of them are repetitions of previous
charges aix reports, known well to both the|

- and Paris stations and to Headquarters off:
concerned with the AMLASH group, whose members’
reliability, reputations and good fa: a@re question-
abl Two of the charges - about and "Tota”™
and about AMWHIP-1 and CARRILLO - are new.);

}

B. should be treated so as to protect us aginst any
charge of laxity and so ag to establigh the facts but, par
at the same time, treated so as to avoid attributing
to them more importance than they deserve;

C. should be kept in mind as examples of other
charges which may betandied about and reported by the
AMLASH group t> other governmental agencies or to
otber governments or to news media (In the last
connection recall the implied threat of publishing
ots responsibility, as reported previously by

71C,IN 36634.);

D. should be examined together with a11 the ‘other
available reports so that we my aie
(1) clarify our own objectives and wishes with
| respect to #1] the AMLASH group (and this includes
| : AUMWHIP); z
j (2) sort out which people, if any, are worth our
time in the future;

= (3) take appropriate measures, including inter-
{ tetess rogation and polygraphing, to clarify doubts and
- then, when necessary, terminate those who are
working for us but are not wortbwhile;

H (4) tighten up our own operational and security
H procedures in connection with the AMLASH group.

3. Preliminary Analysis: As pointed out in a preliminary
4 e@nalysis of the AMLASH complex, made in March 1965 when I. vas
preparing for travel to Hadrid in connection with the QUHOPS-1
case: "...There 18 no convincing evidence that the group is
working either for or against the regize of Fidel CASsRO.
Reports on their contacts with us and their discussions among
themselves are at variance. !n 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly
knowing that they were plotting against him, talked to AMLASH-1
end seven members of his group to enlist their eupport against
i Anibal ESCALANTE Dellunde and the communists in Cuba. Possibly
they are playing both ends against the middle. They certainly
have been and are in contact with the two ends.” The following
comments are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA: - .

4. The AMLASH conspiracy ~ As detailed by! 3716
(IK 28634) on 6 April 1965, QUSPORT-1 reporting on a mee’ ing
of the AMLASH group, including AMWHIP-1 mentioned the following

, Bignificant points:
i (2) KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around for
.. years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

" (2) the group was to be prepared to denounce
ODYOKE as responsible if the operation fails and believed that
the resulting scandal would make the Bay of Pigs seem insigni-
ficant; and .

(3) AMLASH-3 was in touch with Cuban Intelligence
#8 established by coded messages which he exhibited.

As reported by 1532 (IN 82939) on 4 June 1965, based on
' meetings with ESPINOSA, the problem seen by is that

“the AMLASH circle is wide and each now friend of whom we learn
geems to have knowledge of the plan.” I believe that the
problem ig a more serious and basic one. As indicated in
paragraph 3 of the present memorandum, Fide) CASTRO himself
reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the group was plotting
Qgeinst him and, knowing it, enlisted its support. Hence we
cannot rule out the possibility of provocation. Assassination,
obviously, is a dangerous game, not merely to the plotters in
@ physical sense, but to a sponsoring government which may
suffer severe political repercussions at home and abroad if its
involvement is made known. In the instant case, the risks of
exposure of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, whether there is
@ provocation or not. Considering the individuals who are
involved directly, their contacts with KUBARK officers,and their
reported plan to expose ODYOKE, persisting in the plan could
be highly embarrassing to KUBARK. (This is even more the case
now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODENVY and ODURGE, although
fortunately the tenor of his complaint was that KUBARK had not
given adequate support to the plan.)

B. The contacts at Paris and the matters affecting
the 8tation.- The "recruitment" of Maureen had been the
subject of an exchange of cables between and Headquarters
and of discussions at Headquarters between and "E (See

1071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955). The annoying thing in
thie connection now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to
ODENVY and ODURGE and the danger that, if he is indiscreet,
bis story about this (and the other matters) could reach some
‘curious newepaperman. (In this connection, it appears that the
Questionable decision to put Maureen in touch with the AMLASH
group was made without the knowledge of STOCKfOOD.) ESPINOSA
did not report any criticism of the KUBARKers a’ but it
is evident that the AMLASH group knows more abou’ em than
we might wish. What is new and of concern from ESPINOSA about
matters in Paris is his story of AMWHIP ] and UNSNAFU-19
dealings. The questions raiged about AMWHIP-1 are of mutual
concern siso to Ki quarters which hag been running him and

which he has visited often. (On the occasion of my

ous trip to Madrid on the QUHOPS-1 cage, GROWERY had voiced
his doubts about the whole group and specifically about AMWHIP-1
and his connection with UNSNAFU-19.) At issue are two basic
points, the knowledge on the part.of UNSNAFU-19 about KUBARK's
connection with AMWHIP-1 and the charge that AMWHIP-] has been
defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction. Also to be kept
im mind is the fact that ODENVY has an office in Paris which
well might have been informed of the allegations and which might
have been asked for comments - although ODENVY policy always
has been to stay fay from any investigation of other government
agencies unless specifically directed by the Attorney General
to investigate.

Criticiem of the! Station - Criticism of
the! Btation by the A! group is not new. AKIASH-2
and were in and wanted direct contact, but the
Btation has Foaervations about seeing them. The Station has

been involved indirectly because of reporting by its sources
about and involvement of Station targets with both tho
and operations (both ued from Headquarters).
(Bea 2982 (1N 72256) and jaee8 (iN 73084) (both RYBAT).)
Meetinge among QUSPORT, QUSWIFT-1, AMWHIP-1 and AMLASH figures
oduced conflicting reports which previously were discussed st
and at Headquarters. Insofar as GROVERY himself ia
ed, it must be kept in mind that he is a natural target
on whom the AHLASH group would be inclined to focus ita com-
plaints. With regard to the specific complaint about "Tota",
GROWERY has identified her as QUSYIFT-7 and hes reported that
no staffer from the Station ever had contact with her.

4. Vurther involvement of ESPINOSA: On 10 June ODENVY
notified at New Yora ¢ [2 had telephoned
EBPINOSA to ask whether he had succeeded in contacting “the
proper people” - i.e., responsible KUBARK representatives ~ and
to request notice of the resulting arrangements.

6. AMWAIP-1; Our plan calla for meeting him next week
to obtain PRQ information and to obtain clarification of the
roles played by those involved with him in the ABKLASH operation.
Bie dealings with UNSNAFU-19 also will be covered, Following
this, an LCFLUTTER examination is planned. This may help to
determine whether he has been. truthful in his reporting.
