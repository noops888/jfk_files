2. Action: In vier of the foregoing, the allegation

A. mhould be put in proper perspective - l.e., not

ignored because of the potential embarrassment

but

considered in the light of what we already know.

(A20rt all of then are repetitions of previous

charges at reports, known well to both the

concerned with the AMLASH grOup, whose members'

rellability, reputations and good faith are question-

able.

Two of the charges - about

C.

should be kept in mind as examples of other

charges which may belandied about and reported by the

AMLASH STOUD to other governmental agencies or to

respect to all the AlASH group (and this includes

AMWHIP):

(2) sort out which people, if any, are worth our

time in the future;

(3) take appropriate mensures, including inter-

rogation and polsgraphing, to clarify doubts and

then, when necessary,

terminate those who are

Preliminary

Analys1s: As pointed out in a prollainary

analysis of the AllisH complex, made in March 1965 when I. vng

preparing for travel to Madrid in connection with the QUIOPB-1

свое :

• There is no convincing evidence that the group 10

working either for or againat the regire of Fidel CAsirO.

Reports

on their contacts with us and their discussions among

themselves are at varinace.

In 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly

knowing that they were plotting sainst his, talked to AMLABA-1

and seven members of his group to enliat their support sgainst

Anibal ESCALANTE Dellunde and the communists in Cuba. Possibly

they are playind both ends against the middle.

They certainly

have been and are in contact with the two ends."

The following

comments are reyed to utters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The ALASH conspiracy - As detailed by

3716

(IN 28634) on 6 April 1965, YUSPOET-1 reporting on a meeting

of the AMISH grOup, Including AMHIP-I mentioned the following

significant pointe:

(1) KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around for

years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

(2) the group was to be prepared to denounce

ODYOKs as responsible if the operation falls and belleved that

the resulting scandal would make the Bay of Pigs seen insigni-

ficant; and

(3)

AMIASH-3 wan in touch with Cuban Intelligence

"the AMLASH circle is wide and each

now friend of whon we learn

seems to have knowledge of the plan."

I believe that the

probles is a more serious and basic one. As indicated in

paragraph 3 of the present nemorandum,

Fidel CASTRO himself

reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the sroup was plotting

against him and, knowing it, enlisted its support.

hence we

cannot rule out the possibility of provocation.

Assassination,

obviously, 1e & dangerous game,

not merely to the plotters in

• physical sense, but to a sponsoring goverment which may

muller severe political repercussions at home and abroad 11 its

involvement in made known.

охровиге

In the instant case, the risks of

of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, whether there 1a

a provocation or not.

Considering the individuals who are

Involved directly, their contacts with KUBARK Officers, and their

reported plan to expose ODYOks, persiating in the plan could

be highly embarrassing to EUBARk.

(This is even more the case

now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODENVY and ODURGE, although

fortunately the tenor of his complaint was that KUBARk had not

given adequate mupport to the plan.)

B.

The contacts at Paris and the matters affecting

the l

Station. - The

subject of an exchange of cables between

"recruitment" of Maureen had been the

and Headquarters

and of discussions at Headquarters between IH7C and WE (See

11071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955).

The annoying thing in

this connection

now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to

ODENVY and ODURGE and the danger that, 1f he is indiscreet,

his story about this (and the other matters) could reach some

curious newspapernan. (In this connection, it appears that the

questionable decision to put Maureen in touch with the AMLASH

roup man made without the knowledge of STOCKIOOD.) ESPINOSA

did not report any critician of the KUBARKers at

but it

in evident that the AMLASH group knows more about them than

we might viah.

What 18 new and of concern from ESPINOSA about

matters in Paris 18 his story of AWHIP 1 and UNSNAFU-19

denlings.

The questions raised about AlWHIP I are of mutual

concern siso to Headquarters which has been running him and

which he has visited often.

(On the occasion of my

previous trip to adrid on the QUOPS-] case, GROWERY had voiced

his doubts about the whole group and specifically about AlWHIP-1

and his connection with UNSNAFU-19.)

At issue are two basic

points, the knowledge

on the part. of UNSNAFU-19 about SUBARK's

connection with AMWHIP-I and the charge that ANNHIP-I has been

defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction. Also to be kept

in mind 1s the fact that ODENVY has an office in Paris which

well might have been informed of the allegations and which night

have been asked for comments - although ODENVY policy always

has bees to stay away from any investigation of other government

"gencies unders specifically directed by the Attorney General

to imestigate.
