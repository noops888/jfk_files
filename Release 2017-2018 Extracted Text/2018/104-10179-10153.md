A.

Loss of Cacho - AMBANG/1 voluntarily raised

the subjoct of the loss of the cache of material on the

island of Caja de los Muertos.

The loss arose from a

tallure to cache these materials on an island south of

Cuba in

controlled ship,

during the month

these

materials,

Including some 200 lbs. of the C-4

which had been made available to A/1.

On resching the

cache area the ship

was surveilled by a small, commercial-

type aircraft,

resulting in a decision on the part of

the VENUS Captain to proceed to Puerto Rico rather than

risk the Joss of the

matorials to the Cubans. A/1

stated that he interviewed each member of the crew

separately and each told essentially the same story.

Upon arriving in the area of Ponco, Puerto Rico, a cache

was made on the island previously mentioned with the

Intent of rotrieving the materials in about three days

done.

JURE Purchase of One Ton of Pentolite - A/1

Informed me that the JURE had purchased a ton of Pentolito,

& high explosive, which is not as desirable for use as

C-3 or C-4: but

nevertheless, & good material for them.

My first reaction was to ask where A/1 had this material.

I reconsidered this request, stating that I hoped it was

well hiddon.

A/l assured me that it was. I gathered

from my conversation with A/l that this material was

not in place in Costa Rica.

In view of WAVE's report via ANTAUP/2, specifically

In WAVE 1463 (IN 11718), Para. 4,

"Alanis said large

sula money has been spent in purchase modern C-3

explosives and some C-4 which was in CISNEROS® home

there subsequent from Costa Rica," I discussed this

matter of explosives with coS, WAVE.

This discussion

was predicated actually on my

telephonic discussions

on this same subject with C/SAS.

On the basis of

this background.

on 5 February 1964, I called A/1 in

San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Based on a carefully prepared

Ilne which Shackley and I had agreed on, I told A/]

that he had better move all such material immediately

out of the United States, Including Puerto Rico.

In

spenking of Puerto

Rico,

I advised A/1 that despito..

his influential friends, he was bound to get into

trouble if he did not get out of that area and move

his operations to Costa Rica without further delay.

I also warned All that the setting up of communications,

that is, a radio station in Miami,

would alnost.

certainly get him into trouble with United States

authorities and result in the confiscation of big

equipment.

A/1 was obviously unsettlod by my

statements and asked me 11 I could not intervene

with appropriate authorities for timo to move the

materials.

I told him that I could not so intervene

in each arm of the Government had its role to pia

and its duties to fulfill

and these could not. be

Influenced. A/1 stated that he would move an fast

na humanly possible to take the materials out.

JURE Plans. - According to ABANG/, ho plan

the infiltration of two teams into Cuba within the nex

BiX weeks.

The first team, of from two to four individuals,.

was projected within the next two weeks as of this date.

In a program of resistance to Castro.

The tine span of tho chart covered Docember 1963

were achered to, tho JURE should be in reasonably good

#re concerned.

• • H. AKBANG/1's Considering Acrial Re-Supply - A/1

had many questions at this time regarding the feasibllity

of eventually using an aircraft to re-supply his efforts

He wondered about radar offects and potential

on low 1lying aircraft.

I mentioned to him that there

fino commercial type aircraft which had

I knew of none that had the capacity for a round-trip

from points as far away as Puorto Rica and Vonezuela

All arvised me that he had the pilots necessary.

to engage in such missions and that he was nost interested

In considering this capability; not only because of the

purpose it could serve in re supply, but also in the

psychologica, cilect that such operational independence

would givo their movemont.

A/1 Asks for Whatever Guidance 1s Possiblo on

Cuban Radar CapabITILY - A/T Indicated a grent Intorest

In recelving any Information we can make available

regarding radar capability along the Cuban coasts. I

charseteriaties of Theralto, Thermale, crenades,

as the problems involved in the use

A/l has an obviously good grasp of radio

devices, and of the characteristics

of explosives; but

same timo it 1n

obvious that he depends upon more

technically compotent porsonnel for working with these

statod that he has engineers in the Jure

A/l's Continued Nepotiation with the Second

Front of tell ElOY UTTERREZ Menoyo, he has not as

yet reached the point in his negotiations which will

bring that group into tho JURE.

A/1 Indicated his

opinion that within approximately six weks be will have

worked out a program porhaps bringing this groups into

the JURE.

2. Comments • Insofar as the activities of the JURE

in U.S. territory

are concernod, I belleve it is important

to point out certain facts.

A.

WhereRs vardous AMTAUP/2 reports have indicated

various activitios and statements on the part of the JuRe

representative in miami, nogello casinos, against this

Agency, there has not bon any overt proof of these

activities.

Nor has thero been any overt proof of a

propaganda drive,

black lotters of any sort, adverse

radio propaganda,

or evon a program

based on a person-

to-person

basis.

Wo should take note of the fact that

CISNEROS's talking har boen restricted so his own littlo

coterio of clandestino cronies.

I discussed the natter

of ANTAUP/2's roporting at great length

with Tony Sforza

and Warren Frank.

I indicated an interest in proof

that CISNEROS 1g'

behind a donigration progran against the

Agency tolling them that wo would not tolerate such a

program, 1f In

fact, wo could prove its existence. I

specifically pointed out tho caso recently reported of

the choice of ono Dioninto SUAREZ Esquirel, who reportodly

has been chosen to fo to Latin Amorica and carry out a

program of denigration of the Agency in universities, as

& case which we could and should follow in order to

satisfy ourselvos that the JURE is working against us.

B.

The AMOTS and tho JURE • I satisfied myself In

talking to Tony Sforze that the AlOTS in general are

politically opponod to the JURE and that the reporting

f this group, to which AMTAUP/2 belongs, must be

considered in llght of itu projudices and lack of

objectivity insofar

as tho JURE is concerned.

of Roxelio CISNEROS • Dospite

what may be the naturo of ANTAPY2's reporting, and we

must admit that he appears to report pretty much what

he hoars, the activities of Rogello CISNEROS in Miami will

sooner or later, unless my warning to AMBANG/1 has some

effect, Involve the JUre with U.S. authorities. This

development is something that we should expect and the

time may be hero when it becomes necessary to tell

AMBANG/1 that CISNSROS had better leave the U.S.A.

Financial Matters - AMBANG/I received a total of

35 thousand dollars.

Ten thousand of this sum is understood
