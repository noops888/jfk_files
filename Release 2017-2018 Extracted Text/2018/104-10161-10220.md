The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

has requested that we arrange an interview for them with

gence Service in 1964.

Subject is now a U.S. citizen and

entered the U.S. under PL 110.

a career associate assigned to

was Subject's

contact in the Miami area. PACHANKIS attempted to locate

Subject; however,

the telephone had been disconnected and

visit to Subject's residence

revealed that he had moved and

left no forwarding

address.

The post office box established

for Subject's use was serviced and there was no communication

from Subject notifying us of his change of address and/or phone

number.

The HSCA considers their interview with Subject to be

extremely important and your assistance in locating

the where-

abouts of Subject through your

office on a priority basis

would be most

appreciated. It is requested that no contact be

made with Subject when his whereabouts is ascertained since we

prefer to have someone whose bona fides is established contact

him and arrange for the HSCA interview.
