transferred

several otner accounts to my oifice sone of which

In answer to your letter VR-I-310 12 March and Capt.

Crockett's letter to Colonel Alcom of 22 March, with copy to

Weshington, the following comments are nade on differences in

London-Caserta transfers:

1..

This 1teu was adjusted on 7th Army January report by picking

up 2,500 French Frane tonsfer fron Caserta.

7th Ay maintains

no Algerian

Frine account and apparently decided not te open

one for this isolated transaction.

London nad no inowledge

thet the orfeinal Cynthis Jacohsen advance wes in Algerian

Francs.

2.

This transfer was recorded on. the 13 of Deccaber by 7th

Arty. See bondon December Report, Dollar Account.

3. This transfer was from Paris, not 7th Army, as Caserta lists.

No adjustment necessary.

See Crockett letter.

4 The advance to Bayard L. Ring and transfer of his acccinting

wes picked up fros 7h Try November report.

Subsecuent

Information stens that King, SI, accounted to 7th Aray For 50,000

Fr-nes, which his statement

shows that he drew from Rogeo

Balaguer in Algiers as operational funds to be used in France.

According to the instructions contained in your

5336.19.2. This includes a b275.0.0 deposit with your ofíice

These transfers went through our books in july.

We will con-

tinue to deposit 661.19.ª to Miss Taylor's account on th: last

day of each month until further notice.

2. In your letter of 27 May, you notified us of travel

advances amounting to t40.0.0 to sembers of the qualt group

Since you specifically listed the itens as advances, we

nave

deducted them fror Salary payments made here. • The members. of

the group insist that these payments were for expenses incurred,

and that no repayment was to be made.

We are Inclosing a

copy of a staterent by one of the members of the group. Can you

straighten this matter out for us?

Your menoranoun of June ll

gave us the intormasion that one of the nesters of the group

had been short changed in the amcunt of 1l.e.O, out we can do

nothing about crediting the account of the proper individual

until we know nis name.

If these items are to be considered

as expenses,

we see no reason why they should be transferred

SUBJECT: Transfer of S0 Accounts

1. In reply to your letter oi 26 June, we did, as you

state, transfer to your office the sum of 1,400,000 French

Irenes on our noverber 1944 report for the SPOC/US Account.

To imply frow that, however, that the operation was in any way

56333

our responsibility or that me had any mowledge of it is to

overlock eatirely the circu-stances under which the transfer

TaS

made.

This transfer originated with the 7th Army, which,

until that month, had been under your control.

All funds

advanced through Aglers,

and all expenses incurred on it

vere Incurred In territories then uncer YEDTO control.

office accepted the transfer of Noverter, and we did not even

know, the nature o? the operation,

the project originated

with Jou, was

on 'ith Army. books when trey came under our entrol,

and was returned to you without apparent objection.

3.

To have credited us with knowing, when we made the

¿transfer,

that "the soment Teans hit the ground they "ere the

responsibility of the ETO for debriefing and handling" is to

have grented us extraordinary prescience.

A much more practical

way of handling the transaction would have been for you to have

trensferred the advances

made in Algiers to us as they were nade,

11, es you say in Paragraph o,

"these teams went through Algiers

only for the convenience of getting them Into. Southern France, i

and they drew funds from me on the besis of approvals in London,

and thet me lost jurisdiction over the the minute they hit the

soil of Frence.*

In that way London could have had some know-

ledge of the responsibilities which you claim are. ours.

4.

Apparently I must repeat that the Jedburgh financing

for your theater was not handled through my office and none of

the arrangements effecting sich operation were ever discussed

with me.

Therefore, despite what Colonel Glavin says with

the entire operation financially

has been yours.

Fith respect to the close. of your paragraph 6

asting that I inform you how I decide to handle this,

because

you are closing your theater,

I.can only state that the decision

1s one which is autoratic, and the one originally taken. : In

effect it is your problem and the final accounting and the closing

out of the secount is for you to handle:

that"

you will n0.

would seen a rather road

be able to handle it after July 19'I assuned your responsibillty

statement in view of the fact that

as Special Funds Officer for the theater imposes upon you the

obligation to close all of your accounts

regardless of any dead-

line which you may wish to impose.

Tith respect to your paragraph 5 in which you stete:

•As you have let Colonel Baker

"sily" through your fingers"--I

apparently must repeat what I said in my letter of June 21,

peregraph 3---Colonel Baker stopped in my office abcut ten

ago on his way to Fashington and agreed with me that it would

be absolutely impossible for the account to be cleared here, in

view of the feet thet I had none of the

background or records

which mould be available to your office."

•6. I have no intention of treating a matter of this

importance on the basis of picayune accusations,

such as are

contained in your paragraphs 7. and 9, as I wish

to stay on the

overell subject.

As we now understand the transfer of lovember, 1t

can be broken down into two parts:

1,000,000 French francs advanced to Col. Baker, and

400,000 on SO Operations Barres, Bruyers,

Rostand.

In regard to Barres, we credited you on our transfer of 29 Janu-

ery with returns made to this office by Paul C. Sheelines Ris

eccount was cleared, with the exception of 15,000 francs he had

edvanced to a war correspondent,

for which he assues personal.

responsibility, and a personal advance of 2,500 francs. " All

that remains is to itemize and enter the expenses listed on the

statement we sent your office, and to collect 17,500 francs

from Sheeline.

Pals picked up fron your transfer of 25 May 622,774 francs on

Col. Baker's Avignon

Presumably you have an accounting

for the difference between that figure and the 1,000,000 advenced.

Lt. Sichel

stated that he believed Col. Beker had made en account-

of that, and 1f s0,

his account is presumably cleared.

Now that the 7in Arny has more or less come under our

Jurisdiction I am wonderirz whether or not you have given

any

thought to hoi se say clear cutstanding financial matters with re-

gard to personnel of OSS attached to the 7th Arny.

Naturally I hate no idea fron this end as to how your

units are

set un with rescect to funds;

that is, how Jany peopie

there

may be in the field: with evances outstanding and hor any contiring

projects or operations cut authorized and budgeted may be at the

present time handled by 7ah Army groups:

Purely from cabie correspordence I gather that yourman

Sichel is assigned to the 7th irmy for the purpose of hardiing

Special Funds matters.

Ectever, I am wondering if it would be res

sible for you to

submit tc zy London office with & copy to

Springsteer,

Paris,

a lisine of all advances outstanding with the

Ith Army and any other pertinent data concerning operational projects.

For the time belay re can continue to eperate as ve are how

doing by keening each otre= constantly advised and working closelzi

together in an effort to keep things on an even keel.

HowevEr, it:

mulght be tell to set a deachine, such as 1 November,

after which time

all personnel as igned by OSS to ühe 7th Army should be advised tat

Special Funds matters vii: come directly under the control of the

Paris Office, and,

of course,

autonatically under oncon.

Sichel

will cf course continue t

operate with the 7th arny, but I thir's as

of 1 Novenber he

should report to Puris rather than to Caserte ardl

should come more directly under my office.

I am sure you Till realize that tds is a most difficult

"rite and I do net nean to. sound presunptucus.cr

dictatorial; however, in view of the fact that the corers that be

nave brought the 7th

nat 1t Is absolutely essential for us to regularize cur.oan sho:

in order to conforn.

I am hopeful that me may be able to sit doin together and

work out the details in serson and with that thought in zind I ar!:
