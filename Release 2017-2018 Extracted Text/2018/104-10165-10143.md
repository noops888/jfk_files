"FROM: «Lt. Colonel Robert ii. Alcorn

1. This letter is prompted by letter of even date
concerning the Jedburgh accounting wnich you wished to transfer
to my office. }

PTT rae

2. You wili recall that some months ago I protested
the fact that you hea transferred a staggeringly large aavance
to our books against Henry Hyce, a great part of waich nad been
outstanding for neeriy two years. I was reluctant at that é
time to accept a transfer for old accountings in sizeuble i
amounts end I stili feei tnat eaca one of our field offices ;
snould be extrezeiy scrupulous in seeping outstanding acvances
to an absolute minimuz asa most certainiy in limiting tne i
length of time over wnicn taney may be carried. ae

3. During tne past two or three months Caserta has
transferred several otner accounts to my office some of whicns
ware long standing on Caserta's boos ena in every case these |
transfers have been pickea up witn reiuctance. I snouic like!
to point out that my cifice, itn a total sersonnei of i4 i

Fe people, 1s nandiing the largest theater spread over a terrific
Ee area from Norway to the deaiterrenean end srom the Unitea i H
Kingdom into Germany. We are harc pressec to keep our normal; :
business functioning smoothly, wnile at tne same time we :
control tae problems acich confront us witn tre establishment:
of new missions, sucn as those to Denmarx, Norway, sad the new
and large German Mission. Particularly curing tne past six |
weeks we have been wording uncer terrific pressure because of ;
the constant soirting of personnel from peris to London to {
Weshington, @iebrich, ana other points. in view of the fact |
that we nave made every effort to close out ail outstenaing |
accounts as quickly as possible in orcer that the reauction ©
of OSS, ETO, may be aone efriciently, it strikes us as highly;
- wnfeir to ave the buraens of anotuer theater turust upon Us, !

discover by cnance taat Coionei Glavin acc yourself have been —
negotiating wits Lt. Sicnel for a special essignient witnout
my knowleage, as my first iniormatioa on tnis matter came in
@ copy of Jonn #iiiiams' letter cr jue iz to you. I consider:

out unfriendiy ana mfeir. it. Sicnel is neeaeu for assign-

establishment in Jime 19,3, through tne saintenance of a
continuity of energetic personnel ous ccnductea its affeirs
in sucn manner that its cooks can be closed completely within

continues to accept transfers from Caserta whicn would only :
serve to put addec pressure on my ofiice exc at the same time “-~

burdening my own personnel witn these accounts in orcer that
your office may ciose its books.

7. %I regret naving to srite a letter of this kind
because in the two years I nave functioned in the ETO I have

feel that the situation has reacnea a point demanding absoiuti

1. In reference above subject London has requested :
me to clarify itces seven and eight.

7 a. Item seven: °

Eastines. This is an adjusiient trensfer on en operation
chargeu to Mr. Henry Hyde. The egent ceme beck in August
end turned in 54i,v00 Frones to this office. In September
report tais amount was teken up as being trensferrea fron
Caserte, end Caserta was edvised of the transfer. ifhen
the totel denry @ account wes grensferred to this office
in October, this srevious transfer was not deducted from
the total. Therefore an adjustment, transfer wes nade.

be Item eight: : Lo
Transfer of 50,000 FF on operation Bossuet as weil as 5 Louis
a'Or. This originated in a mistake in Lt. Volre's original ;

velopeé hovever thet he had only 350,000 FF and 20 Louis ato:
edvenced to him, I took up his amounts in the September efe
and notified Caserta. ishen finelly the SP0C a/c were trans-
ferred in Septecber, the cistake was found, tut not ed- q
justea until Novecber, since I requested Lt. Volze to ro) 7

through his notes egein end neke sure if he received 400,090 j
French Frencs. after the question was clarified, adjustngat 3,

trensfers were race.

TO: --Captein Devid C. Crockett |

FROM: Lt. Col. Robert H. Alcorn
SUBJECT: Transfer of So Accounts

1. In reply to your letter of 26 June, we did, as you,
state, transfer to your office the suz of 1,400,C00 French
frenes on our Novexber 1944 report for the £POC/US Account.
“To imply fror that, however, that the operation was in any way
our responsibility or that we had any ‘mowledge of it Is to
overlock entirely tue circurstances under which the transfer
wes made.

2. This transfer originated with the 7th army, which,
until that month, had been under your control. All funds te
advanced through Algiers, en¢ all expenses incurred on it
were incurred in territories then uncer MEDTO control. Your
office eccepted the transfer of Noverter, and we cid not even
know: the nature of the operetion, since the project originated:
with you, was on ‘/th Army. books when they came under our entrol,
end was returned to you without apperent objection.

3. To have credited us with ‘mowing, when we made the |

trensfer, that "the moment Teams hit the ground they were the |

responsibility of the FTO for debriefing and handling" is to
have grented us extreordinary prescience. A much more. practical
way of benéling the transection would have been for you to have
trensferred the edvances made in Algiers to us as they were made,
af, es you ssy in Paragraph 6,“these teams went through Algiers
only for the convenience of getting them into, Southern France; ;
and they "drew funds from me on the.besis of epprovels in London,
and thet we lost jurisdiction over thes the minute they hit the
soil of France.* In that way London could have had some know-
ledge of the responsibilities which you claim ere ours.

4. Apparently I mst repest that the Jedburgh financing
for your theeter was not handled throuzh my office and none of}
the arrangements effecting such operation were ever discussed ]
with me. Therefore, despite what Colonel Glavin says with

Captain Crockett -2- 6 July: 1945 |
respect to the responsibility of this theater, the fact still
rerzains that the entire operation finencielly 1s end always

hzs been yours. With respect _to the close of your paragraph 6
asxing that I inform you how I tlecide to handle this, beceuse

you ere closing your theater, I-can only state that the decision
ds one which is autonetic, and the one originally teken. : In
effect it is your problem and the final accounting and the closing
out of the sccount is for you to handle. That © you will not
be able to handle it after July 15, would seem a rather troed
statement in view of the fact that I assumed your responsibility
as Special Funds Officer for the theater imposes upon you the
obligation to close all of your eccounts regardless of any deac-
line which you may wish to impose. :;

5. ‘ith respect to your paragraph 5 in which you stete:
*hs you have let Colonel Baker "slip" through your fingers"--I
apparently must repeat what I seid in my letter of June 21,
peregraph 3--"Colonel Baker stopped in ny office abcut ten dzeys
ago on his way to Washington end. agreed with me that it would
be absolutely impossible for the account to be cleered here, in
view of the frct thet I had none of the background or records
which ould be availeble to your office." ;

6. I heve no intention of treating a matter of this
Anportence on the besis of picayune accusations, such as are
contained in your paragraphs 7 end 9, 2s I wish to stay om the
overell subject. ins

- 1. As we now understand the trensfer of Hovember, it
cen be broken down into two parts: H

1,000,000 French frenes advenced to Col. Baker, and
400,000 on SO Operations Barres, Bruyers, Rostand.

In regerd to Barres, we credited you on our trensfer of 29 Jenu-
ary with returns mede to this office by Paul C. Sheeliney - His
gecount wes cleared, with the exception of-t5,000 francs he had
edvenced to 2 war correspondent, for which he essumes personal
responsibility, and a personal zévence of 2,500 francs. “All
that remains is to itemize and enter the expenses listed on the
statement we sent your office, end to collect 17,500 frencs
from Sheeline. q

Paris picked up from your trensfer of 25 May 622,774 francs on
Col. Baker's Avignon account. Presumably you have an accounting
for the difference between that figure end the 1,000,000 advenced.
Lt. Sichel stated thet he believed Col. Beker had made 6m eccout-
ing in Paris. We are requesting confirmation of thet, and if so,
his account is presumably cleared. if not, it will have to be
transferred to Washington. |

Paris did not pick up your transfers on Bruyers and Rostend, |

nor do I see kuw they can, having no more information than we,

Now thet the 7t2 Army has more or less come under our /

thought to hos we aay clear cutstanding financial matters with re-}
gard to personnel of OSS zttached to the 7th Aray. : i

Naturally I have ne idea fron this end as to how your |
units are set un with resect to funds; that is, how sany pecoie there
may .be in the field. with zvances outstanding and hew sany continuing
projects or operations du_y authorized and budgeted may be at the {|
present tine handled by 725 nied groups, a i

Purely froa cable corresnordence I patier that yourman
Sichel is assigned to the 7th army for the surzose of ha.
Special Funds sa‘ters. Herever, I am wondering if it would be ccs:
sible for you to submit tc zy Lendcn Office with + cozy to

Sprinzsteen, Paris, a listing of all advances outstanding with the

7th aray and any other pertinent data concerning operzticnal rofects. .

For the time being we can continue to operate as we are ae
doing by keeping each othe constantly advised and vorking close2zj
together in ar. effort to <eep things on an even keel. rever, iti ‘
might be rell to set a deadline, such as 1 November, after which thie ey
all personnel as:igned by CS3 to the~7th Army should be edvised that
Special Funds matters wiil come directly. under the ecntrcl] of the ,

' Paris Office, and, of ecurse, automatically under Londen. Sichel™
will of course continue ts ooerate th the 7th srsy, but I thi
of 1 November he shoulé rerert to Puris rather than ite Caserta ard}
shoulé come more directly under my office.

I am sure you iil realize that tds is a. most difficult.}

dictatorial; however, in view of the fact that the powers that be +,
have brought Aen bey Army uncer ETO, I think ycu will understand
that it is absolutely essential for us to regularize cur-omn shop

é 2 With reference to paragraph 2, the advances made —
to these ren, which anounted to 40 pouncs, were in the definite!
a form of trevel advances and the nen should definitely account
to you for this money. It is trues thet one of the cenbers of
the group was short-changed one pound by Lt. Brewster, who
handled the cash for them as I did not see the con in our
office, As, however, the man never Claized the short-change :
aricpercerserenients I ean only suggest thet you invest it in champagne because I: - -
gertainly don't know what to do with it zyself. As Lt. Brewster” J
has gone back to Washington now there is co way thet I know of: ; wer
that we oan verify the statement made by Schonfeld as to ~
