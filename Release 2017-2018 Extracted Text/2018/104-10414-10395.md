SUERENE OBJECETYES AND RELATED PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS. :

The overall objective of the LIEMPTY project activity is to’ collect
operational. information on the LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well
as related targets of opportunity, through stationary end mobile photo-
grephic end physical surveillance coverage. Corollary objectives which are
to be fulfilled through the use of the LIEMPTY installations end personnel
are as follows:

1) o provide operational information pertaining to the daily activities
and movements of LIMERICK personnel, particularly those individuals of.
intelligence interest, as well ag information on the LIMERICK physical
facilities and visitors to the premises.

i

2) To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, other officiel installations, and persons of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico. i

3) To provide operational iugpar’ end other protective services to Station
Personnel. and operations as may be deemed necessary.

“The above objectives are tobe fulfilled through the use of the LIMITED,

LILYRIC, end LICALLA fixed installaticns, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the
services of contrect agents Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver G. SCANILING. These
objectives are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the
following sections of the current Related Mission Directive as approved for
Mexico City Station:

Priority A, Section 1, Subsection’ e
Priority A, Section 2, Subsection c

Throughout the period under review, Project LIEMPTY continued to contribute
@irectly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station end Headquarters*
requests and requirements for coverage of various targets falling within the
franswork of the above cited objectives and the Related Mission Directive.
Specific examples of LIEMPIY progress, accomplishments and contributions by
each project. component are as follows?

coverage an essential and reliable tool for following the daily activities

extremély, tight security measures instituted by the local security forces
tn the iimedtate vicinity of ‘the LINERICK installation, stakeouts by the
{unilateral survellience. tean are precluded. However, with LIMITED

Personnel prepared by LILYRIC personnel, complements the LIMITED coverage

sai has. been Juiged to be of eel quality ani value to the LEOTED
coverage.

LICALLA

The LICALLA installation continued to provide coverage of the back of

‘the LIMERICK installation, the garden, and patio area where many of the -
Personnel and their families congregate. This coverage gives the Station
its real insight into the LIMERICK target and provides a large’ part of the
information on which the Station bases its identification of LIMERICK
staffers, their rank and positions, the staffing estimates, and the
intelligence comections of the’ various officers. In addition some
information.of LAURICLE interest is provided by LICALLA (see paragraph 2, -
section f of HMMA~2h235 dated 2 Septenber 1964 for further details).

LIENRAP i

A greatly increased use of the LIENTRAP unit was evidenced throughout
the period under review. . This asset was employed extensively for photo-
graphic coverage of PCM Headquarters, the PCM Women's Congress, the homes
of PCM members and the residences of foreign Commnist exiles in Mexico.
Much of this coverage was in support of past or planned recruitment
attempts and was needed to provide identifications of other local or
visiting Commnists.:. Specifically LIENIRAP coverage assisted in the
heey ‘end the verification of the eddress and contacts of
& 1, prior to the Station's successful recruitment of this high-
‘evel POM member. The section primarily responsible for the Station's
aatiPa activity has classified the LIENTRAP coverage as a most
"valuable" part of their effort.

5) PHOTO COVERAGE - GENERAL >
Me

ai
Daring the 9 month period from 1 Novenber,to 1 August 1964, the LIEMPTY
project produced approximately 770 rolls of operational still photographs,
of which 595 rolis were directly concerned with the LIMERICK target. ‘Thia
coverage, linked with the daily logs kept by the basehouse keepers of the
activities of the LIMERICK personnel, while contimually contributing to
the Station's regular CE effort, has been particularly effective during
crisis times. such as the GPFLOOR investigations. While the photographic
coverage is used almost exclusively for Station operations in the LIMERICK
area, LIEMPIY has also provided direct support to other operations such as
providing verification of a double-agent's visits to the LIMERICK
installation, _,

6) Olaver Ge SCANTEING

During the period 1 December 1965 through 30 August 1964, long-term Station
asset, Oliver G, SCANTLING (ps) contimed as the cutout to the LINITED
basehouse, and made his regular contribution as the alternate contact of
LICASA-1 in this sensitive LAURICLE operation. SCANTLING also performed
mmerous pretext investigations, serviced actoumodation addresses, and
prepared formal casing reports. Of particular significence were
SCANTLING's regular checks of the accommodation address used in the
sensitive ARINPULSE operation, the thorough investigation of a former
GOTH agent of interest to KUBARK, and detailed casings of the Chinese

Commnist Fair. (See also Section VI, PLANS, for SCANTLING's future
operational assignment). 7

7) Raymond He

During the period under review, GERENDE contimied in his assignment as
‘the Station cutout to the LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses, the LIENTRAP
unit and as the processor of the raw photographic take, and with the
assistance of LIEMPIY-10, contimed to provide ana service the majority
of the accommodation addresses used by the Station, The contributions
made principally by GERENDE (and to a limited extent by SCANTLING) to the
“sensitive ANROD operation can accurately be described as unique and
essential to the success of that operation, Although this activity ie
necessarily a Headquarters directed effort, the local contritutions of
GERENDE end SCANILING are integral. ingredients of that operation.

GERENDE.

D. It will be noted from the above samples of LIEMPIY contributions to the
Station's progress towards fulfillment of the pertinent sections of the
Related Mission Directive, that:notwithstanding their demonstrable value
end importance, these contributions actually represent only a portion of
the activity directed towards the fulfillment of each objective. Therefore,

“any precise measurement of project progress is precluded. However, ‘based
on the performance and overall contributions of the LIEVPTY project during
the past project year, the Station concludes that this project is essential
to the fulfiliment of the Related Mission Directive and mst be continued
during the forthcoming project year..

TI. CHANGES

A) On 2h September 1964, the Station was informed by Headquarters that a
LIEMPIY project photograph which was one of several supplied to the Warren
Commission in Noveuber 1963, would be published in that Commission's formal
overt report. Since LIMERICK officials would undoubtedly be able to

sing equipment
from these basehouses. All basehouse personnel were briefed in general on the
situation and specifically on how to cope with any possible inquiries from
Goverment officials or LIMERICK inspired or prompted newsmen, Complete
‘gmergency commnications systeus wére arranged for all basehouse personel,
Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver G, SCANTLING. Upon receipt. by the Station of a
copy of the photograph, “it vas determined that the LIMITED basehouse had
provided. the photograph in question. This consideration, linked with further
enslysis of the limitations upon any counteractions available to LIMERICK
officials, allowed the Station to re-activate the LILYRIC. ena LICALLA bases
on a phased basis in early October 1964, However, because LIMITED was the
originator of the to-be-published photograph and due to the age and deterio~
rated condition of the LIMITED property (owned by KUBARK), Station Mexico
City-dia not reactivate LIMITED and presented to Headquarters a plan for the
deuolition of the present LIMITED structure with recommendations for the
construction of a new building complex, (See MEXI 1307 dated 20 October 196%
for additional details).

B) In accordance with paragraph 2 of HVMW-12297 dated 28 Jamiary 1964, the
value and productivity of all essets under Project LIEMPTY was closely
reviewed against the necessary security and efficiency requirements. It was
determined that LIEMPTY-12 and LIEMPTY-8 could be terminated without ceusing
intolerable gaps in operational coverage or en unacceptable decrease in
efficiency, Both LIEMPTY-12 and LIENPTY-8 were terminated on 30 June 1964;
at the same time, in keeping with the ODYOKE economy program, a further effort
was uade to reduce the costs of this project by placing LIEMPTY-19 on an
hourly rate for vork performed for the Station.

©). On 30 September 1964, the field Case Officer responsibility for Project
LIENPTY wes transferred from Jeremy L. NIARCOS to Cornelius L, PEUVION;
however, the analysis of the finished take from the photographic basehouses
continues to be performed by Robert B.. RIGGS.

XII, . ERRECEIVENESS, ' 5
The effectivensss of sus ‘LIEMPTY ‘project’ mist be judged ‘on the basis of the =
reliable daily coverage provided rapidly and securely for the Station and
interested Headquarters' components on the LIMERICK installation; the rapid
mobile coverage provided regularly by! LIENTRAP; and the support to these and
other operations provided by Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver G. SCANILING.
(See Section I, Subsection C for specific examples of this effectiveness).

lv.

In the opinian of Station officers who use the LIEMPTY photographic product or
receive LIENPTY operational support,’ this project has responded most satisfactorily
to the needs and requirements,

PROBLEMS !

A) The only major operational/security problemwhich confronted project LIENPTY
uring the period under review were the security implications stemming from the
release of the overt Warren Comtission report. (See paragraph II, Section A).
The precise damage occasicned locally by the report, cannot be measured until
the mid-Novenber release of the report annex containing the actual LIMITED
photograph. Lares interim period, the emergency contact systems are
being maintained in readiness, the cover stories of. all personnel involved
have ‘been reviewed and strengthened, and no undue concern has been displayed
‘by any of the project personnel. ' Potential station countermeasures to the
possible LIMERICK reaction to the publication of the subject photograph were
catlined in NEXI-1018 dated 25 Septenber 1961,

B) No unusual personnel problems have ariden and the overall perfornance of all
agents comected with this project has been satisfactory.

PLANS, ' .

A) ‘The future of the LIMITED baschouse, property and perscrnel vill be determined
within the near future, (See Section 2, subsection a).Station has acquired
enother apartment on a temporary basis in the LILYRIC complex to replace the
loss of LIMITED coverage and it will be activated after the acquisition and
clearance of basehouse keepers.

B) No basic changes sre contemplated in either the administration or operation
of the LICALLA or LILYRIC bases. Station will again initiate motion picture
coverage of selected LIMERICK personnel engaged in conversation in the

C). ‘the Station plans to maintain the, increased level: of LIENIRAP operational
activity, with this asset being targetted in the near future against the
Partido Popular Socialista (PPS) in support of the Station's new PPS
‘penetration program.

D). Effective on 1 September 1964, Raymond H. GERENDE assumed the cutout role
and responsibility for the LIMITED basehouse in addition to his other
operational duties outlined in Section I, No other basic operational or

. sdministrative changes are. Planned for GERENDE for the ensuing period.

E) The reaoval of Oliver G, SCANILINO as the cutout to the LIMITED baschouse

was a result of the recent death of his wife, his pending trip to)
{ — ] and the Station's desire to

more operational responsibility to Raymond H. GERENDE. « After SCANILING's



return from Japan, he vill assume operational duties and responsibilities in
an activity not comected with Project LIEVPTY. Therefore, salary and
operational. expenses. for SCANILING are programed for six months only.

F) Other than presented above, Mexico City Station plans no other significant
project changes since it is felt. that this project 1s now operating at its
optimm size. Justification for the retention of three basehouses was
presented in detail in HMMA~23343 (which is available at Headquarters).
Efforts will. be contimed, however, to refine and better utilize the existing
project organization and assets. |

VIT.. cogs : (ALL figures are dollars, Ue 8.)

‘A) Past. Project Year - Station recorts indicate that Project LIEMPTY expended
$55,952.78 during the period 1 December 1963 through 30 September 1964,
Approximately $9,000 will be expended during the remainder of the present
project year, It is estimated that approximately 20 hours of case officer
time per week is necessary to satisfactorily fulfill the operational,
administrative and analytical requirements of this project. Bi-weekly
accoutings with receipts and/or certifications are subuitted by Raymond H.
GERENDE ana Oliver G. SCANELING to the Station Finance Officer, via the
case officer for all Project LIEMPTY expenditures.

3B) Rnsuing Project Year - Project LIEMPTY was programed for $60,000 for the
forthcoming project year. Due to the Station's economy measures, however,
only’ $45,300 is Bornes for the ensuing year. Of this amount, $27,675 will
‘be expended in FY 1965 ena $17,625 in FY 1966, A detailed breakdown of
