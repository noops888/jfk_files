Ve Diseover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA a44 produce cue very aignificant piece of information on lee ©
OSWALD befare he shet President Kennedy. On 1 Cstober 1963, our Mexico

City Station intercepted a telephone call lee CSWALD made fron someplace

in Mexico City to the Soviet Embassy there, using his own mame. Spesking
broken Russign end using his true name, OSWALD was talking te the E=baasy
guard, OSYEDEOV, whe often anewers the phone. OGWALD said he had visited

_the Bubassy the previous Saturtay (26 Septenber 1963) and epoken to a

: consul.

«ram for him to Washington. Ee wanted to know if there were “anything

whose name he had forgotten, and who had
A hypiteiscut aay nine
new." The guaré said if the consul was dark it was (Velerly Viedsirovich)
KOSTIMOY. ‘The guard checked with somsone elee enfl said that the message
had gone out but no anewer had been received. He then hung up.

This plece of information was produced from a telephone tap center

which we operate jointly It

Gur joint center produces great

masses Of telephone intercepts which ere transcribed and reviewed by our

email staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone converas-

tien ef 1 Geteber had been trenscribed and a summary of it enbled te

i Washington. ‘The neme Lee OSWALD meant nothing special to our Mexico

City Station, tut in their repart thay di@ judge him to be an American

male.

The cabled report was received in Washingten on 9 October and checked

the Soviet Exbassy in Mexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD who had
Gefected to the Soviet Union in 1959 end returned to the USA in 1962. On
10 Oeteaber 1963, the day after the report from Mexico City, CIA Headquarters
sent out a cabled report about Lee OSUALD's phone call to the Soviet
Embassy; the report went to the PBI, the Departamt of State (because
OSWALD was « US citizen), and to the Mavy Departwent (because he was a

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the



13-00000

liklikesg that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of thic same cable was delivered by hana to the Immigration and
Raturslisation Service, with which we have no cable link. ‘The same day
@ long cable went cut to Mexico City informing our Station of the back-
ereund of @efector Lee OSWALD and asking for more infermetion. Our Station
was instructed to pass its information on the phone call te the Mexico
City offiees of the FRI, the Exbassy, the Raval Attache, and the Inuigra-
tion ené Returalization Service. This was done.

In ite original report of 9 October, Mexico City had seid it bad @

1 October 1953, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation
in Menies City provides us with secretly tasen photegrephs of many but not
all visiters te the Soviet Bubasay there, taken with telephoto lenses.
Accordingly, we cabled the Navy Department on 24 October 1963 asking for
@ photograph ef Lee CSWALD from his Marine Corps dnaya so we could compare
photes. We hed not received this photegreph by 22 Hovember 1963, but in

i any event, it tuned out that the man photesruphed outside the Soviet

SECRET

Eubessy was not OSWALD anyway. As chance woulé have it, none of our
several photo obsemtion points in Mexico City had ever taken an identi-
fiable pleture of Lee OSWALD.

Our Hexies Clty Station very often produses information like this
on WS citivens contacting Soviet bloo eubasaies in Maxico City. Frequently
the information we get is extreasly incrimizating, and on ome er two
esccasions we have even been able to apprehend end return to the UEA
Awerican military personnel who are attempting to defect. In ali such
cases, ow’ Headquarters desk requests ani obteins the special peruission of

‘the Deputy Director for Vian’ to pace the tevegttory tuforsation:on a :03 «::

citizen to other covermmont agencies. Derogatory information on Americans
is not treated routinely; in each case the DDP or his Assistant personally
serutinize the infermetion, make eure it fs exedible, and decide whether and
to wham it will be passed. Only in absolute emergencies is the Kexico City
Station authorized to pass such information directly to the FAI office in 5

the U.S. Eabasay.

At this writing (13 December 1963) we do not knew what ection the FBI



13-00000

end other egencies may have taken based on our report. We cursise thet the
FBE may have made local checks through Mexican eutherities to see if

Lee OSWALD wus actually in Mexico City on 1 October. Indeed, leter in-
vestigation has confirmed ell the details of his trip, where he stayed,
an what he did. fo avoid crossing lines with the FRI, au Mexico Station
undertook no local investigation ef its ow. As we now know, OSWALD left

Mearico on 3 October and was no Lenver thare when our report was put cut.

Since this telephone tap operation is a joint one

the Kexiecans aleo had the 1 Octeber intercept on Lee OSWALD,

When vord of the shooting of President Kennedy reached the offices
of our operating divisions end staffs on the afternoon of Friday 22 Hoven-
ber 1963, transister radios were turned on everywhere to follew the ®
tragedy. When the name of Lee OSWALD was heard, the effect was electric.

A phone message from the FRI came at ebout the same time, neming OSWALD


13-00000

as the possible essansin and esting for traces. The mesmage wee passed
on wt onos by the Cafef CI, Mr. Angleton, te Mr. Birch O'Heal of his
“a Special Investigations Unit. Mrs. Betty Egoter of this tit inmedinately
recognised the name of Lee OSHALD ané went for his file. At the saze
time, Mra. Bustos of the Mexico Desk, who hed writtes our first Seport on
OSWALD an 10 Ostober recognized the nasa frou radie regorte end went

For the next week, dozen poople in the Agency were continuously
engaged in bending ineoming messages on the ease, writing reports to be
cabled out, tracing the uses mentioned, and researching files. Withina «©
week, 27 enbled reports had gane out to the Waite House, the State Depart-

mest, end the FBI. Many cables of guidance and inguiry had been sent to

SeGRET

our evarseas stations, and many pieces of information on OSWALD and his
wife had been received back. ‘The Mexico City Station researched its
telephone taps very thoroughly and came up with several more conversations

prokably devolving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this name; these

“] connected him also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Mexicans
were arrested and questioned about bis activities, giving a gecd pieture

of whet he was really up to. Many conferences were held with the FBI

laiaon officer whe asked us for curtain actions and passed us infermation

i from the FRI investigation. Oncthe minus side, a host of fabrienters,

most of which we investigated. AKL of these ere seon diecredited, but they
ere still coming in.

Duving this phase ef sur work, we served primarily in support of the
FSI, which vee entrusted by the President with the major responsibility for
the investigation. The FAI was teo tusy to supply us with much of its «
oun information, but ansvers were given te specific questions we posed to

he had eerlier given the address to Silvie DURAN end wanted to lock it

A particulerly sinister aspect of OSWALD's dealings with the Soviets

in Mexice City erlses from the liklikood that he met vith Soviet Consul

Valeriy Viedimirevich KOSTIEDY. In his 1 Geteber phone call to the

Soviet Eakasey, the quad OBYEDKOY suxgestes that the Congul OSWALD kad

talkeé to vas KOSTIKOV if he was dark. OGWALD seews to agree with this,

but the identifleation fe very casual. In his 9 Novesdher letter te the

with as “KOSTIN,” but there ie no persen of thet exact name in the Soviet

Bubessy in Mexies City. KOSTIMOY is accredited as a Consular Attache and

doen ectually do « let of consular vork, but he is believed te te a

Seviet EGB officer, and it is believed that he works fer Departuent 13 of

the KOS, the Departwent charged with sabotage and aseagsinations. The

suspicion that HOSTIKOY is @ KGB officer arose from his work habits, and

hie association with other KGB officers. It wee hardened when it was


found that he handled a Soviet egent vho was trained to éo sebotage
work and that he turned this agent ever to ensther KGB officer vo is
definitely know to vork for the 13th Department. It is generally true
in KGB work that sebotexe agents ere handled only by 19"Departaent
officers.

Embassy guard Ivan Ivanovich OBYSOKOY is himself believed te be a
KGB man from previeus essigmments as a bodyguard and sumillent. But
unless some direct evidence of Soviet complicity is discovered, it is
mect Likely that COWLD*s denLing with X00 wen ORTHDEOY ait WOOTEON mus

Bome insight on the Cuban attitude toward the arrest of Silvie DURAN

and the involvement of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained from tve intercepted phone cells made between Cuban President
Osvaldo DORTICOS and Cuban Ambassador to Merieo Joaquin HEMUIDEE Armes on
26 -Sovember 1963, the day after Silvia DURAN was released from ker first

arrest. At Og:hO AM that morning, Presiéent DORTICOS phoned the Aubassader
