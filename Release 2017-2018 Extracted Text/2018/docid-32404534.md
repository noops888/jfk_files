element for the clandestine intelligence collection mission of
the CIA and the United States. Whether sending a message to a
covert foreign national asset in Havana, or receiving a message
from the CIA Chief of Station Fi GEEnanE or supporting military
and diplomatic representatives in Bosnia,[ Jis a key element in
that effort. Moreover, it is extremely vulnerable to physical
attack because of the proximity of uncontrolled public roads and
spaces. Accordingly, and as’ considered_in more detail in
paragraph 6 below, any affiliation off with the CIA, no matter
how insignificant the individual occurrence or document release
may seem, has the very real potential to jeopardize lives,
negatively affect the Agency mission, and thereby do irreparable
harm to the national security of the United States.

extant risks, there’are new activities atL__ Jin direct support

which will be needed to enable the DCI to continue his work
during any emergency situation. Additionally, active
consideration is being given to also designating as the

insure that the facility is maintained’in such a way that it will
be prepared for any emergency situation, it would certainly be in
the best interests .of the US Government not’ to permit any
official affiliation, no-matter how’ minor, off jand the CIA.

7. (8 The preceding descriptions of ongoing and planned
activities at[___ presents, I believe, an intuitive sense of the
damage to national security which would’ follow from a linking of

with CIA.. In sum, the conduct of covert communications and
support activities as well as the presence of officers who will
soon be serving overseas under cover in highly sensitive
positions can not take place at a facility linked to CIA. But
there are some very specific damage issues that I wish to
highlight and they include:

Personnel Security: Our eee eee even,

facility, the increased visibility and scrutiny would

demonstrators, and emotionally unstable individuals.
Facts, examples, and specific concerns include:

) As detailed on the attached annotated photographs, the array of
communications equipment and its proximity to public spaces and roads is
clear. For example,

Act 6 (1)(B)

4A8f The current Kasi prosecution provides ample evidence of the risks
posed by the public identification of CIA domestic facilities. Any individual
intent upon seeking retribution for perceived wrongs quite naturally seeks a
target providing the largest possible public notice and while CIA headquarters
is an excellent target, a covert facility is even a better target, and a
covert facility supporting the foreign espionage activities of the CIA is the
best possible target for a political and public statement.

° 4) The breach of compound security was by an out-of-state vehicle which
followed an employee through a remote gate and the driver had no credible
explanation for their actions; the incident is considered suspicious and
unexplained. The suspect package incidents include a box which was placed
(not dropped) next to our facility which we believe was intended to test and
thus observe our response to suspicious packages. Gate turn-arounds number 8-
10 per month and include only those vehicles which ignore clear signs that
they are entering a classified government facility but proceed in any event to
our gate; it is instructive to note that, very few of these individuals state

Overseas Assignments: As discussed above, numerous CIA
employees involved in communications, technical
intelligence collection, and human intelligence
collection train and operate atL___]for the exact reason
that it provides a secure environment disassociated from
the CIA. We know from ample evidence that foreign
intelligence services have as a primary goal the
identification of US citizens who appear to be ordinary
public servants or private business people but are, in
actuality, clandestine intelligence officers.*° simply
stated, the identification of this facility with CIA will
label any and every individual associated’ as a likely
intelligence officer and thus substantially negate their
operational ability if not place their lives in jeopardy.

the President or Cabinet officials -- have value only as
long as their identity is secret. The public disclosure
of the fact that[___]would serve as such an ated
which could come from a general compromise of| asa

negate Agency planning in this regard, vitiate
expenditures, and leave the Agency with» few realistic
options for survivability. We must assume that any

Germany) and clandestinely-acquired KGB files that substantial resources have
been directed at such identifications. Typically, a suspect American will be
surveilled for some time in order to identify his or her target and
cooperating foreign nationals. To identify a communicator is one of the
highest priorities since it provides a possible entrée to cryptographic
compromise as well as an opportunity to “roll-up” or identify the numerous
human intelligence collection officers who rely on that particular
communicator to transmit information back to the United States.

entity which had the willingness and capability to attack
the CIA would be inclined to inflict the maximum damage.
Identification off Jeven as a generic CIA facility
poses an unacceptable risk to this key aspect to CIA
continuity of operations.

¢ (8) Potential Compromise of Classified Communications or
Technical Collection Platforms: In addition to the
foregoing physical threat to our communications
facilities (e.g., the potential to destroy towers,
satellite dishes and transmitting facilities by terrorist
act), the disclosure ofl Jas the ,transmit_and receive
site for CIA classified communications to
sites as well as in the field presents a
significant opportunity for any number of foreign nations
to enhance their signals and communications intelligence
efforts at our expense. While the scope and
classification level of this memorandum does not permit a
detailed discussion, I am convinced that this disclosure
would make[ Ja target of hostile foreign intelligence
services.

Original Text of John F. Pereira

Following is in response to questions raised by the EXDIR:
1. Members of JFK Board:
Chairman: Judge John Tunheim (Federal District Court, Minnesota)
Four other members: Henry Graff; History Professor Emeritus, Columbia U.
Kermit Hall; Dean of Humanities, Ohio State
William Joyce; Assoc. Librarian, Princeton U.
Anna Nelson; History Professor, American U.

2. Intermediate steps before appeal to President:

a) We are discussing our concerns with JFK Board Staff, and will ask the Board to
reconsider its decision.

6) We'll propose that a senior Agency officer brief the Board on the sensitivity of
Warrenton.

3. Who would make the appeal to the President ?

Thus far, the process calls for the Agency's General Counsel to forward the appeal
to the White House Counsel, with the approval of the EXDIR and/or DCI.

4, Has there been an appeal to the President before?
CIA has submitted one appeal, in early 1996. The issues concerned identification of

certain European stations and liaison relationships. The White House directed the
Board and the Agency to "work it out", which was done. After the ADDO briefed the

CERABENHAL-

HW 55157 DocId:32404534 Page 22


Board, a compromise was reached.
The FBI has submitted three appeals, none of which was successful.
5. Does ISCAP have a role ?

Thus far, ISCAP has had no role with regard to JFK, as far as we are aware.
