By Witliam Safire

WASHINGON, Nov. 12—~On Oct. 10,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United. States put ‘his personal signa-
ture on a document that Jaunched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church's subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
focused on the F.B.1. Yesterday, whent

. the committee counsel itrst set forth.

the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-i
partment had existed in 1962; today,”
an FBI. witness pointed out that it
was Robert Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed
their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.”

But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nedy root of this precedent to Water-

" gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church

}

| the FBL wes leaking scnrri

were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses inlo the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questioris that have gone unasked for

. thirteen years.

For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-

-nedy's deputy and successor, and ask

what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wivetap Dr, King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.I. know the 7
President was consulted or informed? |

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of- !
fice, and the wiretapping continued,
he was told by angry newsmen that

formation about Dr. King
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church’s political
base, That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant FB. divector Cartha
(Ocke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnson's
personal contact with the F.B.I. in the
witness chair, What did President
Johnson know about the character-
assassination plot and when did he
know it? What conversations tuck
place hetween Mr. Deloach aud Pre
dent Johason on the tapping of Dr.
ning, or about the use FB.

5 Lover-Up

aT aoec tenes ®

“The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are: readily available. A couple of
weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.B.I. man inadvertently started to

blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1952 raed

. the apparent knowleage of Attorney”

General Kennedy. The too-willing wit;
ness was promptly shooshed into six
lence, and told that such information
would be developed only in executive

session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern of containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican’ and Democratic con-

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lya-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the ‘F.B.I.,
but the Church investigators seem to
he determinet! not to probe too deeply.
If F.B.I. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent's men? If Lyndon: Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.I. to spy on political
opponents, who can be brought for-°
ward to tell us all about it? 7
But that. would cause embarrass-
ment to Democrats,
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con-*
gressiona] decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee’s hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.'s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes demure,
ly—and nobody demands to know!
Which nelwork executive made what!
decision under what pressure, ;
T have been haranguing patient
readers for years about the double
standard applied to Democratic and
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would be tid
before the public in damning detail. »
Obviously, Democrat Frank Church
is not the man to do it. His jowl-
indignation is all too setec-

; and others is evidentiy going
to be allowed to coai
Pity, You'd think that after ail the
nation has beea through im the past
few years, our political Jeaders would
have learned that the ene theng that
brings you down is the act of cover-
ing up. —
