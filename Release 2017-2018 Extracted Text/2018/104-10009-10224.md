on the possibility "of deciassitying a Warren ssion_,
document In whic! rence Is made to the |

The document in question Is
together with an attachment dated
lovember, 9

1 would recommend strongly that and
Its attachment should not on any account be declassified or
publicly released for reasons which Include ‘the following :

(1) It has never been officially stated that there
1 is a "C.I.A. Station" or that
i there are C.I.A. officers in|
This has been avoided as a point of policy.

i (ii) Publication of these facts would invoke a
“spate of quéstoris by the Press ‘and In* the
. Parliament, which would be contrary to the

national security interest, for example

(a) Who approved the establishment of
the 'C.1L.A, Station"?

(b) What is Its composition and location?

(c) What is Its purpose in
(Allegations have already been made
that C.I.A. Is interfering in[—__]

domestic affairs.)

i . . (a) with what[___asencles does It
"deal?

which has not been
publicly disclosed, could be brought

| into discussion.)
| (e) With what other foreign agencies does the
| deal?

(fy Wheat control Is there over

such dealings?



(ut) Questions could be ralsed as to the Investigation

by th

calls, the validity of its quoted conclusion and

of the anonymous telephone

the result of its further enquiries.

1 am glving a copy of this letter to yourf |

Station,

With kindest regards and best wishes, .
