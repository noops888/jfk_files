. meeting with Jose Lui: TOALCEL Ordonez ({20)-140.55.), leader of the Juatezalan
Communist’ Party (F37) exile organization in Mexico. LIREBEL-2 reported that he
arrived at BALCARCEL's home at 2000 hours on the cin, and found ZALCARCEL about
to leave. BAICASCEL requested that LIFEEEL-2 taxe him to a gareze where his
car was being repaired, which LIREZEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car was not ready,
BALCARCEL asked LIREBEL-2 to drive hin to a meeting which he had scheduled for
2100 hours with his “Soviet contact." (liote: BALCAZCEL had previously told
LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet Enbessy.) LIREBEL-2
and BALCARCEL drove to the "Parque Escondido," also xnown asthe "Parque indido,"
located on Insurgentes Sur between Gonez varias and let Streets, LIREPEI-2
parked and BALCARCEL held his meeting with his "Soviet contact" standing on the
sidewalk of Gomez Farias Street bordering on the parx., The reeting lasted for

30 minutes, :

2, BALCARCEL commented after re-Joining LIX=2#i-2 that his "Soviet contect”
had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which ke had received
fron a Guatemalan student. The student tad asked to talk to the Soviet by true
name and asked hin for sone information on the Soviet national soccer tean, which
is scheduled to play some games in Guatezala. The Soviet told BALCARCEL that he
had told the student that he could not provide any current inforzation on this
subject, and that the student should try to get this information from El Salvador,
where the team was to play some games. prior to their arrival in quatemla.
BAICARCEL said that the Soviet was angry thet this student had asked for him by
true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (ABU) leader

who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving
his nane out to unauthorized persons. : ara

1. LIENVOY reported that on 6 February 1970 Valery KOSTIKOV (201-
305052), 2nd Secretary of the Soviet Esbassy in Mexico, received:a long-
distance tolephone call from Guatemala. The operator asked for KOSTIZOV
by nase, then told the caller “lr. HONTEMRGEO, I have your call to Mexico
ready". When KOSTIKOV came to the phone, the caller stated be was call-
ing:oa behalf of the Gustemalan University Students Organization, but did
not further identify hinself. The caller and KOSTIROV discussed the USSR
national soccer team and its scheduled appearance in-Guatemala. KOSTIXOV
stated he was not certain oxzactly what date the team waa scheduled to ©
arrive in Guatemala, and suggested that the caller contact the seccer
federation in Bl Salvador, where the team.would be playing prior to its
arrival in Guatemala. The caller also inquirod wbethker there was eny ine
formation on the Ballet. (Reference) and was told that there was noac.

2. Xt should be noted that normally queries concerning the Soviet
soccer team or the appearance of Russias Ballet troupe woald be

handled by one of the Cultural or Sports Affairo officers of the Embassy.
KOSTINOY's participation in these natters,.cs. reported above, would seea «||:

conformed exactly to that ‘described by BALCACEL to LIREBEL-2 in paragraph 2

KOSTIKOV setting up clandestine contects with Alejandro BZR@WDZZ Alegria
(201-06268)), leader of the Nicorazuan Commnist Party exile organization in;
Mexico, and siaflarly with lorenzo ZRLAYA Zosero (201-045172), a Honduran

Meetings are arranged by: phone using open

His’ most recent assigrnent has. been..the development,

assessment, and recruitment of 201-S109S1.

LIRPTY-3 bas few

peers at the art of developing an operational lead, but his
extensive operational activity in past years against the MEVARSI
target has required that he be used sparingly, selectively,

and always under alias. Developmont of 201-810981 has been

his only assignmént during the reporting period, and LIEPTY-3
made good early progress, Purporting to.be the representative
of a film club for architects, LIEMPTY-3 was able to get 201-
810981 to agree to become a consultant, Thereafter, LIZZPTY-3
continued to ask questions about 201-810981's work, te the point

“where 201-810981 realized that more than a fila club for

architects was involved, At this point it was cecided to.let
LIEXPTY-3 break cover, recruit 201-810981 to supply information
on the work of his office (but not--at this point--the people

in his office), and continue to handle. him. until the recruitment
was firm and previous questions about the’ stability and
reliability of 201-S10981 hed been resolved, This was done,

and 201-S10981 accepted recruitment, knowing that WOLADY
intelligence was involved. LIEWPTY-3 teld several meetings with
201-8169S1 after recruitment, and countersurveillance did not
reveal any signs of MHHARSH surveillance. For about a month,
however, LIEMPTY-3 hus not. been able to contact 201-810981,,

and it is possible that. the latter has developed cold fect.

LIRCCKET~1:

1) LIROCKET-1 is net nonthly, tine and place arranged
at the previous meeting. During these uectings he is debricted
on his twice-weekly teaching rcessions at the MNHARSH Enbassy.
His regular student has been the Subject of 201-0228975, nnd he
has had occasional dealings with othoy ITiARSHers, particulnrly
AESEASICK, The meetings with 201-020063 kave not been. of
particular interest, and we had been waiting impatiently for
the latter's replacement to arrive, so that LIROCKET-1 would
have a better target to work on, It was LINOCKET-1 who

came up with the first local confirmation of the identity of
this replacenent (NUXICO CITY 1105, 2 August 1969). Dealings
with AESDASICK have been concerned with attempts by the
director of the school where LINCCKET-1 teaches to borrow
sociological films from the NHIMARSII] fila office.

2) It now appears, however, that LIROCKET~1 has
feached the ond of the line, For some tice he has‘been involved
in a rather nessy divorce action, and in August LIROCKET-1
reported that his wife had denounced hin to Mexican authorities
as an RVROCK agent (a few months previously,’ she had denounced
him as an NIHARSH agent). LINOCKET-1 was not inclined.to take
his wife's. ravings too seriously sinco he considered hor sligntly
nuts, However, LIENVOY reported that on 16 September 1969
LIRNOCKET~1's wife called 201-028975 and told him'she had to see hin
urgently on sometbing of extreme interest about her husband,
201-028975 told hex to come to the Eibassy, which she did, and
she presumably repeated her accusation, Since that tine,
LIROCKLT~1 has received a polite brush-off. He has been told
that the MNNARSI Embassy has run out of funds for English -
language training, and that there would.-be..no. more “lessons
unless. 201-028975's replacement, or the nev Awbassador (when
and if. one arrives). wanted to rehiro him. He was told,
however, to check in xegularly, and he was given,°as usual,

an invitatiou to the annual MHHARSH national day reception (he
did not attend because he was ill). LIROCKET-1 has not spoken
with 201-028575 since his wife's visit--all dealings have been
through AEPOLYP, who has for some time been the paymaster for
LIROCKET-1.

3) LIROCKET~1 was not aware of his wife's visit, and
even after the case officer, without telling him that we knew
of the visit, brought LIROCKET-1 around to the conclusion that
she might have done this, he still does not think that she
spilled the beans to 201-028975, (It is apparent that the
MHHARSHers, whether or not they believe Mrs. LIROCKET=1's
story, have concluded that LIROCKET-1 represents a-security.
hazard, and they are sinply going to drop him, LIROCKLT-1
will continue to press the MHHARSIers for an answer regarding
his future with them, and if, as suspected, they keep putting
him off, he will be instructed to break contact and. he will be
terminated by the Station.)

always in a small restaurant within walking distance of the
downtown office where he works a half day, Meeting hours aro
pre-arranged. to permit LISACK~4 to attend on the way to or

from this second job, He compensates for his lack of forsal
education by responsiveness to case officer direction, natural
intelligence and cooperation,

4. LISACK-6; He is the portero of the building in which
Subjects of 201-837203 and 201-788861 (who took the apartment

of Subject of 201-205304) reside, He maintains a daily log

of these two MNHARSHers, their families and visitors. He was
met 12 times during the period. Since hescannot.be absent fron
the building for over thirty minutes without arousing suspicion,
meetings are always. for a brief ten minutes and are held in a
nearby’ park. As has been reported, the case officer who handles
LISACK-6 became the target of unknown surveillance in August,
and again in October, following meetings with LISACK-6. The
Station believes that the surveillance was accidental, in that
the meeting place was in a neighborhood frequented by male and
female prostitutes and other undesirable characters. In any
event, LISACK~6 has been put on ice, to be revived if the
occupants of his building become higher priority targets.

4. WISACK-7;, She was not met during the reporting period.
She remains a "reserve asset" for special requirements in the
real estate field for such potential uses as safehouse rental,

‘~ "key acquisitions and locating tenants when needed, Although

there is no immediate requirenent for her talents, we would.

like to maintain her Operational Approval so that she can be
called on as a cleared asset when needed. ;

: ‘ghere are no known unresolved probleas of security. The
security problens relating to LIROCHET-1 aod LISACK-C holla
above) Are under control vith no adverse ‘effects noted.

6.

Plans

a. There are several assets ‘of the REDTOP section who
have been carried uncer SB/COA for a fairly long period of
tine. Since the targets of their access: change from time to
time, as well as the nature of the information they provide,
we do not believe they warrant special or new projects to
cover thea. We do believe, hovever,.that they chould be
brought under a project to facilitate orderly reporting and
administration without resorting to separate progress reports
on each,

b, Since their ectivities closely parallel those of
assets already covered by LISACK, we belicve it would be
logical to include LIRODBIN-1 and -2, LIORDER-1 and Subject

of 201-£43659 (on whoa we are awaiting an Operational Approval)
in this Project. Although none of these is paid a salary,

such a change will require some cost amenduent to the Project
to account for minor operational expenses which have heretofore
been charged to SB/OJA. Separate correspondence will follow
on these assets.

c,. There are several additional assets currently in the
developmental stage who may eventually be administered under
LISACK, ‘These include Subject of HMMA-37742 of 28 August 1969,
targetted against AEPOLYP; Subject of 201-351552, targetted
against A£MERGER; Subject of 201-848881, currently in scucial
contact with Subjects of 201-259563 and "201-08 “9068 under
Station direction; and Subject of 201-859225, who reports on
bis contacts with Subjects of 201-305052 and 201-744341,
among othcr MUHARSHers.

SOVIET EXSASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE
STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK

by Carlos Montiel

Costa Rica

Mexico City ‘-- In.a letter addressed to our editorial
department Peruvian. newsmen informed me that, being acquainted...
with my article “Ahora Peru" [Now Peru), they asked that country's
chancellor, Edgardo Jarrin, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade
mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important
“mission, that of Soviet diplomatic ee yi
In that article Thobserved that members of the Soviet’
: embassy in Mexico City had predicted in that city's social vat
: circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would establish diplomatic
relations with the Kremlin at the enbassy level.
7 a “ Aecording to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lima daily
ots La Prensa confirned with prominent play the report that I had made oa

". in El Universal Grafico whose substance I had obtained thanks to
the. indiscretion of Soviet diplomats’ included. in the. "cocktail

" abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext _

TIPSY DIPLOMA7S

by Alonso Fongeca G.

Source: Nottdertttted. £4 Mn...
Bul whee ce,

“This is the amusing story of a ‘gpree" which began in‘
the frosty dawn of 12 Decenber among tubbles of expensive
wines in the "red light" district of Mexico City and reached <
its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. What are
involved are two Marxist-Leninists fron the, Soviet Union who,
on breaking the chains of disgraceful tyranny weighing on
respectable diplomats, “tanked up" in tourgeois bars, not in
order to cheer up and forget some sorrowful episode or other
that ynawed at their hearts but rather to fire a broadside of :
y that when ore is "tipsy" everything thet he does is absolved.

The diplomats of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valery .
Kostikov, second secretary, ani Vladislav Koromovshxin, attache,

‘not only forgot among hippies thessociaiist ethics in order to

indulye in a “small drink among those who are in the limelight" ~



but, in the midst of a big "binge™ made possible by hateful
capitalist brandy and whiskey, tiey decided to accomsany four

: enugincers of PEMEX [Petroleos Mexicanos; Mexican Petroleur} in
an old automobile to Ciudad Mante. On the way, after the
custozary excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine"
drove the Hussians to the worst extremes of crudeness exhidiice

without any of the “academic bearing" that the Frier.dship

University of Moscow notes as the major assets acquired by the

progressive men of Leninism. Accordingly, abuse rained on

the Mexicans.

..The four PEMEX. engineers, as any well-born sons would
have done, defended their country with firmness. Thereupon,
‘the Mussians suddenly became transformed into diploxat-gunmen; *
brardishing their weapons at the engineers. However, no cout: -
because Russians are better at getting ready to ‘handle remote-
“controlled spaceships directed at the moon.than.in the skillful
discharge of prosaic pistols, they found themselves disarmed fn

eal order by the Mexicans.

“On reaching, Ciudad Victoria the PEYEX easier handed
ane 4 Ausoian attaches and their guns over to the local authorities.
Despite the unanimous desire of all those present to see the

Soviet representatives get their comeupparce the latter, with

 Ensuledar

arrogance, insisted thet their diplomatic immunity be

bic eer

with the Chinese government of


following the hard line even thouz we do not believe that
Mao would hire Russians of this ilk considering how ineffective

funmen they proved to be. - ce

J. FEINGLASS, The SPR.on Subject has been prepared and will be forwarded aa

2, It ls Interesting to noze that LICOWL-! describes KOSTIKOV as follows:
He ls a man who would do anything to anybody, He ts without morals, education
or manners, H uses foul language and has no respect for others, When
KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-I's) escablishment, with Sovlet women present,
KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees,
while thelr husbands are present, and thinknozhing of it, According to LICOWL-1,
the husbands say nothing when KOST] TKOV does this, (Comment: However, from
a recent LICOWL-I tape, lt appears that Yurly, Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV,
GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative
employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he (ANDRIANOV)
was golng to say something:-to KOSTIKOV - someday --but had no: sald a word to

him as yet.)

Valerly Vladimtrovich KOSTIKOV, =.
- Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV Is approxtmately 35 years of age, ;
corpulent and paunchy, with a rouad somewhat fleshy face that sports a
“5 o'clock shadow, and wears oversized tinted glasses In dark heavy frames,
which partlally obscure a palr of small, but plercing eyes. H's heavy jowla, le
thin lips, wide nostrils and dark hair add to an ipresston that his features i
_ are more of a Semitic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav, A
shapeless dark sult-coat, carelessly put over a whire shirt, with unbuttoned
collar, through which protrudes a <uft of dark halr complete a photograph of
Valerly Viadimirovich KOSTIKOV, Attache ot the Consular Office and
identified member of the KGB, : : : i ‘
KOSTIKOV arrived in Mexico in December 1961 and assumed bis duties:
_ aS an attache at the USSR Consulate at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City,
Owing to his extrovert nature and. propensity for drinking, he soon acquired ;
: several “buddies” of simllar background and with simUar tastes, Among :
these individuals, bis closest assoclates have been, or still-are,-the following: *
itally Borlsovich SHUBIN, Attache and Identified member of the KGB, who
left for the USSR in July 1964; Ivan Gavrllovich ALFERIYEV, Pravda Corres-.
: pondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR tn October 1964; and Oleg
: _. Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO, Vice-Consul and Ideatified member of the Ke
who Is still In Mexico, and who has accepted KOSTIKOV into bis circle of .
- Intimate frlends,

Dore gesos3 i



However, tt was mostly with SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV that KOSTIKOV
: felt entirely at pil Meny a time KOSTIKOV would talk to.etther one.of
“ them cn the phone and Indulge tn a friendly exchange of obscealtles, where-
as he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO in a like: menner, even though
KOSTIKOV has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's house, KOSTIKOV
» developed an exceedingly close relationship with SHUBIN. They used-to
travel together to varlous parts of the country and to spend time together
_ with thelr families at the Casino de la Selva, @ hotel In Cuernavaca, But
it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTIKOV's
attentions, An embittered acrimontous woman, Roza, who despised her
: husband and had a flerce hatred for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed Into __
. a different human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her on the phone In his
best unctuous and ingratlatlod manner, It is Impossible ro say whether they
: had sexual relations, bat the obvious and stroag sexual overtones tn Roza’s
_volce led one to presume that she had more than just:a friendly Interest in
KOSTIKOV, who on the other hand, was aad using Roza as a ae tor

wife Roza has 2. tolerant.atclrude towards KOSTIKOV's probable incir-
alons Into the domain of miital Infidelity, siice, on one occasion,
when KOSTIKOY had been !nvired to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV's
home, and Roza KOSTIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV agalust '
drinklng too much, a womzn answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV

peeved at the fact that she had not been invited to the party rather than that
other women were present there at the tlme,

When KOSTIKOV atarted talking to his wife on thls particular call, he
already had had a few drinks and In disguised votce spoke to her In Spanish,
French and English, possibly to impress those who were present, His
Spanish {s quite good and fluent, his French Is rather tolerable, but his

This fluency in Spanish affords KOSTIKOV.a great latitude for ‘making *

In fact, this neglect of official dutles prompted a heated argument between


" who declared tha: osténstbly the constilar stafv does not preform any useful . ;
function, but just loafs around, H‘s assertion has been confirmed in part
by the attitude of this particular group of Sovlet Embassy employces, who
quite often seek some diversion of a non-Intellectual type,. Thus, on ‘one
occasion, when a group of Soviet tourist:has a brlef stay tn Mexio, one of.
them - a woman, complained during a phone call to the Embassy that

‘KOSTIKOY and Leonid Vastlyevich NIKIFOROV, Inrourtst representative

In Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIFOROV's apartment cy

order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourlsts without any

.. ,information about thelr next move and Jetting them shift for themselves,

Since the departure of SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV, KOSTIKOV has staried
to “cultivate” NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potentlal drinking companion, ---

and has been talking to him on the phone a number of tlmea recently in quite

a famillar tone of voice, It seems that. NIKIFOROV, a younger’man, Is

being Influenced by KOSTIKOV to a certain degree.

KOSTIKOY's family life does no: appear.to bea: stormy one; because bis’

To sum:aarlze KOSTIKOV's ‘character traits and abilities: KOSTIKOV ap
1s.well trusted to take trips around the country tn the company of another :
Soviet Embassy employee on varlous matters of Importance and, on
occasions, ‘he acts as an Interpreter for visiting Soviet officials. H's
known physical defect ls weak eyes. Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called. 7
an eye-speciallst for an appointment, because his eyes were troubling him
and that ls probably the reason for hls wearing tinted glasses, Sometimes
Mexicans refer to him 3s the man with glasses, It ls quite possible that an -
auto acctdent KOSTIKOV had in Vera_cruz may have been caused by his

somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessness, However,

when KOSTIKOV was excusing himseif for It, GARMASHEV, to whom
- he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that it was about time KOSTIKOV
learned to drive, ee ae :

: Owing to this shortcoming of having weak. eyes and his physical make
up, KOSTIKOV does not participate In vartous Indoor or outdoor sports as
much as do other members of the Soviet Embassy, It seems that billlards’

are oe the most strenuous execise that he undertakes, However, It must

not be surmised that he is a weak Individual in a physical sense and will

probably give.a good account of himself tf a sftuation will demand ra

which In Russian slang may-mean an individual with a dark skin, or _ ;
refer to the fact of his wearing tinted glasses, or It “mey signify that he wenr
throxgh a school of hard knoc ka i

Tf ts quite certain that KOSTIKOV and ALFERIYEV belong to the 6 same

group of former hooligans, who by dint of sheer dlaregird for mcral

KOSTIKOV seems to be qulte unsrupulous, ready to perform awe sort

. Of task set before him, not in a cold and methodical way, but with a cer-

any other type of scruples. He Is vulgar, untldy and lecherous, with a
penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions in conversation with

his "buddies", with whom he drinks quite a lot. clrcumstances permtrting.

° In addition; ir must be noted that he Is a shrewd and resourceful individual

unquestionably loyal to the Communist system,

EGB’s Thirteenth Deosrtmant pisces the greatest eupbasis on

portant strategic military end industrial facilities of
Gestern countries. | The requirements assigned to AEBURBLE
by both KOSTIKOV and BRYKIX corresporid to this mission.

4. In view of the obvious ODYOZE interest in any acti-
vities of the Thirteenth Department, we urge that you pre-
pare an analysis of KOSTIKCY's activities and contacts in
