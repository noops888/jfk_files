MEMORANDUM

TO

FROM

SUBJECT

: Chief, CI Stall

: Deportallos of Maurice Halperin

1. Attached ls a copy of MEXI 186 In which the atation asked

los guldance on their effort to deport Halperin. We diecussed this

on the morning of 12 September. During the afternoon of 12 Septem

ber I received HMM-A -7904 which outlines the atalions' efforta to

bring about Haiperin's deportation.

You will note from (para 2 of HMM-A-7904) that the slation

began'ite effort on 21 Auguet when LIKAYAK-? was aoked by a Merican

otileial for information on Halperin. It appears that the etation then

went forward in an attempt to have Halperin deported without advising

Headquartera or the Legal Attache.

Thus, when it appeared from LIMEW's statemento (see

MEXI 186) that ODENVY. did not.want American Communiets deported,

the station realised that it was working at crons purposes with the

Bureau since the station's efforta had been in progreas for almost

three wecks.

4. That the Medcan government le probadly confugod al lala

moment da indicated by the fact that Juatavo Dyas Ordas (see para 8

of dispatch) who de la touch with Santillan, probably knows that

Sartillan de receiving information from LUKAYAK-2, who la known

to be in touch with the Americans.

Al the same time (see MEXI 186,

We cannot say, on the basia of avallable information,

whether or not the Logal Attacho knows of our elfort to deport

Halporta. However, !! he does know, and if we go to him now to

say (as we decided yestorday) that we are planning an operation:

to deport Halperin, he could wall sake tha position that he should

and other details of the Stazi fina:ces and those of MlaE It was

explained to LIKini 2 that 'ter had handled tie transfer of large sums of

STERil's monoy into l'exico prior to S:"lu's flight to Cacciosiovaida, (It was

indicated that this inioration was outained in U.S.1o)

do It was suggested that nells petition for dedican eat reuship de denied.

It was sugrested that the STirl funds be frozen in Mesico.

(NOTF: • This nas

the crux of the problem, for it was felt that bi nivin, the lexican Govern-

ment niiicials some chance to tako part or all of tho. funds their cooperation

with the station was guaranteed.)

It was sutgested that lAL'ERIN be deported either to the lS or to a alace

where he could be picked up by Us authorities.

Panana has suggested as

possibly suitcble in tis conection.

On the evening of 23 August, LIMlAk-? gave a written report on the above to

Fernando ROMERO Hernandez in a sealed envelope.

A copy of tils report exists

on as yet undeveloped filt at this station.

LIKAYAK-2 allowed ROTTO dernandes

to read another copy, which was not enclosed in the sealed envelope.

8.

RP.:20 Hernandez stated that the e:velope should not ve given to Fernando ROAN

0 the literaretary To mie, but, to vision

but to vose To Sait this enter of. Inspection

of the Ministry of Interior.

ROTRO Hernandez, added that this was because of the president of tierico was the

originator of the request for infornation on HALPERIN.

He aided that the

President had requested the luister of Interior, Angel CLivia, for this infor

mation. CAVAJAL relayed the request to Justavo #DIAZ Ordaz, Official jajor of

Interior, who in turn, in a formal-sired note seen by LIMYAN-2, passed the

request to jose I. SUTIlll. Si.TIuldil relayed it to Labilor, as'noted above.
