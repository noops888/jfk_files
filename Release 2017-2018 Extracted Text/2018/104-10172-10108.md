MEMORANDUM

TO 2 Chief, CI Staff

FROM 3

SUBJECT : Deportation of Maurice Halporin

1, Attached is a copy of MEXI 186 in which the station asked
for guidance on their effort to deport Halperin, We discussed thia
on the rorning of 12 September. During the afternoon of 12 Septem
ber I received HMM-A-7904 which outlines the stations! efforts to

. bring about Halperin's deportation.

2. You will note from (para 2 of HMM-A-7904).that the station
bégan ito effort on 21 August when LIKAYAK-~2 was asked by a Mexican
official for information on Halperin, It appears that the etation then
went forward ia an attempt to have Halporin deported without advising

Headquarters or the Legal Attache.

3. Thus, when it appeared from LIMEW's atatemente (e

: , MEXI 186) that ODENVY did not.want American Communists deported,

the station realised that it was working at croas purposes withthe
Bureau since the station's efforts had been in progress for almost
three weeks. Hee é :

.. , 4 That tho Mexican government !e. probally confused at this
‘moment is indicated'by the fact that Gustavo Dyas Ordaz (see para 8
‘of dlapatch) who.is ia touch with Santillan, probably knows that
‘Santillan is receiving information from LUKAYAK-2, who 4s known
to be in touch with the Americans. At the same time (sea MEX! 186,

Be Pipa

Per t3y 42.55 .

ak, '

“73 Sy 87

Ror-y 2B SE)



ra 3), it 1s Dias Ordas through wham ODENVY fe working to
Kitempe to stop the deportations. :

5. We cannot say; ‘on the basis of available information,
whether or not the Legal Attache hnows of our effort to deport
Holparia. However, if he does know, and if we go to him now to
say (as we decided yesterday) that wo are planning an operation:
to deport Halperin, he could-well take the position that he should
have been consulted sevoral wooks ago since, if Halperin ie de«
ported he will land squarely in ODENVY's lap,

6.. Do you wish to send the cable decided ou yostarday?.
Or do you wish to change it? 7

recolled at this tine that HALPiiIli"s nane had appeared in the Mexican gress in

3. On 21 Ausust LIKAYAN-2 releyed this request to the case officer, stating his

Qn the evening of 23 Ausust, LIKiYiKe2 gave a written report on the above to

Little doubt that SUVTIANs BEAD Hernandez, HONAH Lugo, and CARVAUAL were all
attrected by the dazeling possibility of acquiring at Least a portion of the

STEHN "millions".

On other 2h or 25 Ausust RY FRO Hernandes made a cryptic remark to LIK\YAK=2 to
the effoct that a high of2icial of tie US Embassy in Hexico had seen the report
on WALP. 44H and thought it excellent, In reply to LIKAYAk=2"s questioning,

ROUERO Hernandez would not state how that official had come to see the report and
would only state that the official might have been the Secretary to the Military
Attache, On 28 August, while the case officer listened in, LIX4YAK-2 made a call
:RO Hernandez end informed hin it had been someone in the OLENVY office who

On 28 Augyot rumors quoted to LIKAYAK=2 by RuSENO Hernandes and SANTILLAN dndica-
ted that HALPERIN would be deported, that the President was studying the case and
that a lot of action could be expected, Rafael sHUHRTA Nava, a police informant
on. Communiet nattera, hinted to LINAYAKe2 that several raids were to be made in
the near future, mich was to be dn Cuernavaca, This led’ LIKAYAK-2 to
believe that the nea RIN group was to be raided, as suggested by this

station,

Likewise on 26 August LIKAYSK-2 reported that he had been sent over tho previous
weekend to Cuerravaca.to locate the Alfred K. STERN home there. Ile stated it is
an imposing home, nearing completion, LIKAYAK~2 added that he has received a
report that Ralph SCOTT; the Stern colored american chauffeur, is the lover of a
negro. woman named "La Kartinique, who does semi-nude dances in Acapulco, and

that for that reason her residence may also be searched.

Meanwhile a technical surveillance was re-estaolished on tie home of HALP:RIN at

residence of Maurice Hyman HALPERIN (and Edith HALYERIN) on 3 June 1957+

= 3. As of 17- June 1957 this covercge vas discontinued because repairmen

6f the telephone company were in tne neighborhood cleaning up old Linas; and

4, It 4s not known when this coverage can be re-instituted; thio depends
pon the departure from the erea of the telephone repairmen.

of the reasons for this is the sbsence of both Maurice and Edith MALPERIN (he —
