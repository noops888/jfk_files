OCCURRENCE:

The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providine sixtv

thousand dollars from the Cuba budgeti

(2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike

base

in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military

men to CIA.

"Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700

Cubans is any longer practicable.

He said that it had been his understanding that

-the-current-thinking contemplated_figures_more_on_the_order_of_3,000.

_Mr.. Barnes

replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as

a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as

3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed

it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in

addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

"Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra-

"The Attorney General inquired

about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt

against him." Lansdale_replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."

The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities

by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of

July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al-

Western Hemisphere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it from the

rest of the hemisphere. "The OAS meeting is to be supported by public demonstrations in

Latin Americal

Jand a psychological campaign assisted by USIA."

The major

task of the diplomatic capability was to encourage Latin American leaders to develop

independent operations similar to the instant project seeking an internal revolt of the

•Cuban people against the Conmunist regime. In the economic warfare area an embargo on

Cuban trade was to be considered after the OAS meeting. The CIA was unable to undertake

the action to sabotage the sugar harvest which commences about January 15 and upon which

Cuba's one-crop economy depended. Sabotage of transport, mills, sugar sacking in cane

fields was explored, according to Lansdale's review. Special sabotage support was noted.→

OCCURRENCE:

Due to reports of popular unrest, political strife, and economic disruptions

inside Cuba, it was suggested that the Special Group Augmented consider the value of

having an SNiE on Cuba made in the immediate future. The CIA has agreed as a matter of

priority to reach a stage in the interrogation of Pedro Roig where he can be surfaced

to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin American nations.

For operational effectiveness, the CIA has selected a new area in Cuba for its initial

radio broadcasts from a submarine for "Voice of Cuba."

The Navy states that the new

area is feasible and State has concurred in the theme and content of the broadcast. They

will take_place-around_the-end-of the month. No-proposals-for-actions-by-the-Department

of State have been submitted since the appointment of State's special representative,

Mr. Hurwitch. They are expected on June 22, 1962.
