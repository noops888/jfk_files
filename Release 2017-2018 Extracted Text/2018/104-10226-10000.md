lwan'S bona fides and therefore could not underwrite the

atenents he had made.

Ambassador Thompson. reriirked that he had just
heard from Isaac Don Levine and that the latter intendod
to write a book on the Oswald case in which he hoped to
make the point that Oswald was mentally unbalanced and
was trying to.break up the Kennedy-Khrushchev. relation-
