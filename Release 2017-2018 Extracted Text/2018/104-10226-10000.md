a gonuine defocior but more probably in agent planted

on us by the KGB.

Mi, Helns described the basis for

• our bolice and

the neans of arriving nt it. Mr. Helms

noted chat we had discussed the Mosonko case with tho

Warren Commission bocause they had received a roport

aron the fut bused on the luls interrogation of Nosenko

periained to the Oswald case.

roport made a

strong case for the position that the Soviet Government

had nothing whatsoever to do with Oswald's assassination

of President Kennedy.

The Counission was insious to know

reaction and ve informed them we were not sure of tho

man's bond fides and therofore could not underwrite the

scutchonts he had made.

Anbassador Thompson remarked that he had just

Isaac Don lovine and that the

latter intended

• to writo a book

on the Oswald case in which he honed to

make the point that Oswald vas acneally unbalanced

was trying to break up the lemody-khrushchev. relation-

ship.

We also relnted the Krockov case in

to the Nosenko case, explaining the day in which

the sovtets could hope, through accusations that forner

Ambassador to Moscow Maurice De.lean wus an agent, to

the defector Golitsyn.

We then described for Stato Department officials

the mainer in which Gribanov operates against the diplo-

natic colony.

Mr. Helms went on to say that we had arrived

at a pout

to turn him back to che Soviets.

At the point it was

decided to roturn subject to Soviet control, he would

be sorved. with an

immigration warrant for deportation

o Europe and alloued to roturn to Soviet custody.: lo

several such turn-bucks havo buch mace in the past

and this has been accopted by the soviots. Mbassador

Thonpson asked .why we

could not indict the man and try

him for espionage.

He explained that it vould bo dif-

ficule to prove

this even if ho vere to give us a full

confession since the only evidence would be his own word.

furthermore, ve would be reluctant to lecome involved in

the evilable publicity thai a trial of this nature would

Ve are anxious to lourn the truth but are not

interested in a trial or punishment for Nosenko.

Ambassador Thompson then said that the only aspect

of our planing wich gave him pause was the idea of i0

curning the man to soviet custody.

He felt that we would

inevitably encounter criticism

fron the press if they

speculated the turn-back

was in exchange for the releasa

of the three flyers.

This the Government would very nuch

wish to avoid.

Mr. Murphy showed Anbassador Thompson the

drafe press statement we had prepared by which we hoved

to malo clear that this was not an exchange of any type

but rolated solcly to the fraudulent character of tho

Nosenlio defection.

This accompanied by additional news-

paper publicity would serve to malic. clear the real reasons

for Nosenkols return.

In a bric aside with Mr. Davis, the discussion

of the letters cane up and ve had

an inconclusive dis-

cussion of them.

what the Embassy was to say

if the wife called again and I foel I must go back to Mr.

Davis on this question.

Mr. Hughes then asked if we were sure we had
