Reference is made to previous information furnished

you concerning captioned anti-Castzo organizetion.

Recently, & source who has rumished insurficient

Intormation to evaluate his reliability advised that

Orlando-Bosch Avila, head of MIRR, is making plans to use

an airstrip, not yet selected, in the Bahanas for the purpose

of carrying out raids against Cuba. Two of Bosch's men,

Jesus Sanchez Martinez and (first name unknown) Gonzalez,

will be transported by a fast speedboat to this airstrip

along with about one dozen homemade impact bombs constructed

by Sanchez. An airplane which will be piloted by an unidentified

Anerican reportedly is scheduled to rendezvous on the Bahama

Island with Sanchez and Gonzalez, both of whom will sccompany

the American pilot on two consecutive bombing raids, spaced

one or two days apart, for the purpose of dropping bombs on

sugar centrals in the Oriente Province of Cuba.

The source stated that the date of the raid bas

not yet been set. The speedboat will be brought from Mlami,

Florida, to some location north of Miami and then will depart

under cover of darkness for the Bahamas. The plane is scheduled

to depart from its Bahamian airstrip at about 3 a.m. for Cuba

so that the attack can be made during the early hours of dawn.

The same source further advised that Bosch has

also entered into a secret pact with Alpha 66, an anti-Castro

organization headguartered in Miami, to attack a British freighter

carrying equipment to Cuba. This attack reportedly will be

Reurairtel 6/9/64 with enclosures.DE Fürnish the pertinent

information transmitted in your 6/9/64 airtel to the appropriate

Bahanian authorities. Keep Bureau, interested agencies and

Baharian authorities currently advised of all pertinent developments

NOTE:

MIRR, anti-Castro organization, has been involved in

cartying out raids against Cuba, some of which have been twarted

by U. S. authorities. On three previous occasions, plans, boats,

equipment, bombs and personnel have been seized by Customs authori-

ties. In connection with a previous plan to attack Cuba, Departuent,

in April, 1964, specifically advised it was requesting Customs,

Federal Aviation Agency and Coast Guard to take all possible

measures to prevent the attack. As recently as May 12, 1964,

Customs seized a homemade torpedo which was scheduled to be used

in a MIRR attack against a Cuban vessel. This attack failed to

materialize.

Information has nov been recelved indicating that MIRR

is planning new attack against Cuba.

This attack reportedly entails

use of airstrip in the Bahanas from which two consecutive bombing

raids will be launched directed against Cuban sugar installations.

Plans are being made in U. S. and material to be utilized in raid

will be transported from U. S. to the Bahamas. $MIRR has previously

used islands in the Bahamas as base fron which to launch such

actaces and we have previously advised Bahanian authorities of these

activities. BU

RE:

MOVIMIENTO INSURRECKIONAL DE

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

NEUTRALITY MATTERS

Previous investigation has reflected that Dr.

Orlando /Boscir, Avila, head of the MIRR, an anti-Castro organ-

attack at the a velled co abandon plat or athle

vessel recently avoided the east coast of South

Florida on a

voyage from Marseilles, France, to Havana, Cuba. This ship

departed Marseilles on May 4, 1964, and was scheduled to dock

In Havana on May 25, 1964.

On May 26, 1964, MM I-1, a Cuban exile who 18

friendly with some of Bosch's close associates, advised that

Bosch has begun to lay new plans for another attack against

Cuba.

Current Investigation

May 283 1964, MM T-1 reported that on May 27,

1964, Jesus, banchez/Martinez, who 18 also known as "Mimi",

and Evelio Alpizar Perez, associates of Bosch, went to

orlando, Florida, upon instructions of Bosch, to examine two e:

airplanes with the view of renting one or both for the next

MIRR operation. MM T-1 said that Sanchez and Alpizar were

transported from Miami to Orlando, and return, by an American,

age about 47, 5'g" tall, weighing 180 pounds, black andigray:

hair, known only as "Otis", and a friend of Bosch.

"Otis"

was accompanied by his wife or girl friend, named "Carole".

MM T-1 said Bosch decided against renting either of these

planes at Orlando, both of which were owned by a medical

doctor, because of exorbitant rental fees demanded.
