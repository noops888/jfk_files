The. informant recalled that SPINELLI was a. non-drinker who had
been born and raised in Italy and still. had a wife and twa
children. living there. He.described SPINELLI as about 614"

, in -height-and. said that. he was known in the area as a. professional

killer, who hired out on out-of-town jobs. He stated that. when
SPINELLI was crossed up in some manner by the VOLPE brothers in
connection with some stills he owned personally, he became so
enraged. that he vowed he would kill all three. The informant
stated that he was with SPINELLI when SPINELLI obtained the
weapon with which he killed the VOLPEs and left a. moonshine
joint.without saying where he was going. He said.he later
heard: the details of the shooting. from by-standers whe told
him that:..SPINELLI. had encountered the three VOLPE brothers .
eating breakfast at Bazzanno's Restaurant on Wylie phate
Pittsburgh, at which time he gunned them to de .

The informant .recalled that SPINELLI gathered his few personal
pélongings together and immediately fled to New York where he
encountered the brother of the BAZZANNO who can the Pittsburgh
restaurant. He stated that SPINELLI killed this individual

and: that the.newspapers. related ,that BAZZANNO was discovered.
with more .than’150 ice pick holes.in him and various sections
of'his body cut off. He recalled. that S hen fled to
Italy and ‘had nerve enough to settle with nis family in the same
town in which the elder VOLPE was an official. He recalled that
the: elder. VOLPE was then responsible for having SPINELLI sentenced
to 25 years in prison in Italy because he could not be extradited
to the United States.

The informant advised that. following the munden, of his Dreeeeel

-LOUIS. VOLPE was incarcerated by the Pittsburgh Police Department

who: thought. he had something to do with the SPINELLI-VOLPE: feud.
He recalled: laughingly that when LOUIS, now.a close associate of

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA,.was released from jail, there were a
great many newspapermen on hand and when a flash bulb went. off

unexpectedly, LOUIS fainted, believing he was shot: He recalled
that during’ the early 1920'3, numbers operations in the Pittsburgh
vieinity were incidental to moonshine operations.and that. most..
moonshiners carried numbers cards in their back. pockets. He
suggested: that.the Pittsburgh Police Department. became ‘interested
in “‘numbers_only when moonshine. became no longer profitable.for
them.. ‘He advised that he. still sees both LOUIS and JOSEPH .VOLPE.:
on-occasion and has seen both of them with MIKE GENOVESE and

JOHN LA ROCCA.
