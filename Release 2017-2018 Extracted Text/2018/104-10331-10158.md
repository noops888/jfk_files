United States (U.S.) under

PL-110, and became a naturalized U.S,

citizen in 1976, The Counterintelligence Center (CIC) handled

Mr. Golitsyn from 1961 untj11 1991 when the

4. (8) strongly believes that the rationale for
declassifying Mr. Golitsyn{s use of is
inadequate given that:

~-The classified.information scheduled for declassification

of not only Mr. Golitsyn, but also his two family members who
resettled in. the U.S. with|him. Those family members’ names were

case, erred in identifying the name,
as a “pseudonym.” The name was a
resettlement identity assigned to the Golitsyn family which was
used to establish their new lives. In contrast to pseudonyms
(which have no basis in reality and have no backstopping) and
even operational aliases (Which may have minimal backstopping and
could be used for a few op: rations and then discarded),
resettlement identiti: iving identities. If the
resettlement identity as once publicly affiliated with
the Golitsyn family, the pérsonal history of all three Golitsyn
family members (not just Mr. Golitsyn) would be highly vulnerable
to being researched since, |as resettlees build their new lives,
they establish public records. Many of these records are now
readily available and explo: itable on the Internet.

~-Even if the nd apt s have changed their resettlement
identities through the yeats, one important piece of identifying
data has remained constant] i.e. their alien registration
numbers. If’ these numbers|/are declassified and made publicly
available, then the Golitsyns’ other resettlement identities,
including their current names, can be The release of
the Golitsyns’ full names, | (note that[ fg not expose
Mr. Golitsyn’s full name) or alien registration numbers will
compromise their current resettlement identities and places of
residence held throughout all their resettlement identities. ©

5. (S) -Mr. Golitsyn; like other resettlement cases, places
a unique trust in the Agen¢y: That it will protect his identity,
