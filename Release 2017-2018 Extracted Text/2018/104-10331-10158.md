MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Review Group, OIM

SUBJECT:

(S)

AnatoLy Golitsyn

Proposed Declassification. of Intormation or

1.

•(S) Action Requested: Reguest that the JEK

Assassination Review Board| (ARB) not declassify and release

Information officially confirming that Mr.l

was

one of Anatolly Golitsyn's former resettlement identities.

Additionally, request the ARB not release the alien registration

numbers issued to MI. Golitsyn and his family members.

2. (S) Background: Mr. Golitsyn, a 71-year-old former

high-level Soviet KGB officer

who defected in 1961, entered the

United States (U.S.) under PL-110, and became a naturalized U.s.

citizen in 1976. The Counterintelligence Center (CIC) handled

Mr. Golitsyn from 196 until 1991 When Che

assumed management of the case. In the

years Inmediately tollowing his defection, Mi. Golitsyn was

allowed to have direct access to high-level U.S. Government (USG)

officials and a substantial amount of classified material both of

this Agency and other Western intelligence services.

Since his

detection, this Agency has attempted to keep Mr. Golitsyn

favorably disposed toward the USG and the Agency to prevent any

possible disclosure of his role with us and other intelligence

services.

(S)

In early May

1998 DO/IMS advised NROC that the ARB

intends to declassify,

that Mr. Golitsyn Initially used the pseudony deemation

dependents would also be declassified.

understands that the

rationale for the ARB's release of this information is public

availability of the name

4.

(S)

strongly believes that the rationale

for

declassifying Mr.

Golitsyn's use of

is

inadequate given that:

-The classified information scheduled for declassification

and release to the public contains the resettlement "pseudonym"

of not only Mr. Golitsyn, but also his two family members who

resettled in the U.S. with him. Those family members' names were

not repeat not exposed

-In any case;

Jerred in identifying the name,

"pseudonym."

The name

was a

resettlement identity assigned to the Golitsyn family which was

used to establish their new lives.

In contrast to pseudonyms

(which have no basis in reality and have no backstopping) and

even operational aliases (which may have minimal backstopping ano

could be used for a few operations and then discarded),

resettlement identities are living identities. If the

resettlement identity

the Golftsyn family, the personal history of all three Golitsyn

family members (not just MI. Golitsyn) would be highly vulnerable

to being researched since, as resettlees build their new lives,

they establish public records. Many of these records are now

readily available and exploitable on the Internet.

--Even it the Gostsyns have changed their resettlement

identities through the years, one important piece of identilying

data has remained constant, 1.e. their alien registration

numbers.

If these numbers are declassified and made publicly

available, then the Golitsyns' other resettlement identities,

including their current names, can be made known. The release of

che Golitsyns' full names, (note that

did not expose

Mr. Golitsyn's full name) or alien registration numbers will

compromise their current resettlement identities and places of

residence held throughout all their resettlement identities.

5.

(S) Mr. Golitsyn, like other resettlement cases, places

a unique trust in the Agency: That it will protect his identity,

security and not publicly disclose his unique relationship with

of retribution from his former government.. Official USG

contirmation of his relationship with the Agency may undermine

his and other's confidence in the Agency's commitment to be

vigilant regarding their security. Mr. Golitsyn is in his senior

years and in poor

health.

Should he perceive the release of this

information as a lessening of the Agency's security commitment,

uSt action lead to his compromise, wa are obliged to expend tunds

to resettle him once again!

the case of Mr. Golitsyn, this

means resettling two entire households at high cost.

6.

(S) Furthermore,

the recruitment of sources of high

intelligence value has always been this Agency's top priority.

ub-1c disclosure of this intormatzon could do Irreparable damag

-• our ability to attract individuals who admire the U.S. anc

might be disposed to collaboration.

Disclosure of cooperation

with the USG would cause any potential source to think twice

before placing his life in the hands of an organization who

cannot protect his intormation.

For those individuals such as

Mr. Golitsyn, who placed their trust in this country in the past,

entered our resettlement program, and are now U.S. citizens, the

release of information with no real relevance to any national

issue, seriously erodes this Agency's credibility and undermines

our Resettlement Program.
