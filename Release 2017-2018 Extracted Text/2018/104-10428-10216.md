Inquiry from Richard Russell of Dial Press Concerning Dallas Field
Office Association with: Lee Harvey Oswald and George deMohrenschildt

1. On the-evening of 13. July 1976, at about 2100, Mr. Richard
Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by
my house. He advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy
assassination and that. he understood I was a friend of George
deMohrenschildt. . He wanted to know if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald
or if deMohrenschildt had.ever suggested that I should see Oswald.
I told him no on both counts and advised that I have not seen or
talked with George deMohrenschildt since the fall of 1961.

2. Mr. Russell attempted-to draw me into discussion of the
Kennedy assassination which. I avoided and wanted to know if I could
give him the name of the chief of the CIA office in Mexico City in
1963. I told him I could not, and he said he could probably get the
name from Mr. David Phillips. I do not foresee any adverse publicity
as a result of Mr. Russell's visit but felt that it should be made a
matter of record.
