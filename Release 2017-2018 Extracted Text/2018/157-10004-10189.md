1º IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT ALVARADO IS FABRICATING HIS

STORY OF SEEING OSWALD TAKE MONEY IN THE CURAN EMBASSY URGE YOU EASE O

UP WITH

WE TID LI LICRCDIOLE THAT INE CUBANS COULD

BRIEF AND PAY AN ASSASSIN IN FRONT OF A NIC INTERLOPERS WE THIN IT

POSSIBLE OR EVEN LIKELY THAT HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY

AS A MIC AGENT TRYING TO INFILTRATE CUBA AND HAS PICKED UP THE NAMES AND

FACES THERE IN SO DOING=

ALL HE WAS SAID ABOUT OSWALD HE COULD HAVE

GOTTEN FROM THE NEUSPAPERS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN INCORRECT ITEMS SUCH AS

HIS STATEMENT THAT OSWALD WORE GLASSES•

THE FACT THAT ALVARADO IS A CAL!, NICE, AND INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN

NOT MEAN HE IS NOT A FABRICATOR•

FYI WE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE

BEING FLODDED BY FABRICATIONS ON THE GPFLOOR CASE FROM SEVERAL CONTINENTS

SOME ORIGINATING WITH PEOPLE ON THE FRINGES OF THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS®

SUCH PABRICATIONS ARE NOT USUALLY DONE FOR MONEY BUT OUT OF SICKLY

FANCY AND A DESIRE TO CET INTO THE INTELLIGENCE GAME•

WE DO NOT THINK IT A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT BOTH DORTICOS ARD

ALVARADO TALK ABOUT MONEY PAID TO OSWALD•

_FOR ONE THING, PAY FOR A!

ASSASSIN IS A FACTOR WHICH IMMEDIATELY RISES IN THE MIND OF EXPERT AND

LAYMAN ALIKE®

• SECONDLEY DORTICOS MAY HAVE HEARD THROUCH SOME RUSSIA

OP. CUBAN SOURCE IN THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THAT DURAN WAS ASKED WITHER

THE CUBANS PAID OSWALD FOR THE ALLEGED ASSIGNMENT•

WHILE WE DO NOT INSIST THAT ALVARADO'S STORY IS BEYOND ALL BELIEF

WE DO URGE THAT MEXI PLACE IT AND ALVARADO UNDER THE MOST SEARCHING

SCRUTINY• HIS INTERROGATORS HUST PRODE DEEPLY INTO HIS MAKE-UP AND

LEAD HIM BACK THROUGH THE THROUGHT PRECESSES WHICH MAY HAVE LED HIM TO

MAKE THIS POSSIELE MIS-STE?•

IV SECURING CONFESSIONS OF FAPRICATION
