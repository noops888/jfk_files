7?-4,on February 24, 1958, pointed out that he has known :

HAZIDAKIS since 1932, and added that for the past twelve to

fifteen years HAZIDAKIS has been a trusted lieutenant of “the

MANNARINO organization, directly responsible to KELLY MANNARINO.

T- went on to say that at the present time HAZINAKIS, along

with JOHN FONTANA, is actively supervising the Baybout and

ap games,operating on the second floor of the” tne
2 LOCA Kenmare Hotel and has the direct responsibility
for holding large amounts of cash and making a final account-
ing of the proceeds taken in each night to the MANNARINO
brothers.

T-4 mentioned tht on many occasions KELLY MANNARINO has told
him that, he trusts HAZIDAKIS implicitly in money matters and
has absolutely no hesitancy in relying on him to turn over
every cent made on the gambling tables.

Bytway of background information, T-4 explained that

around 1932, HAZIDAKIS was convicted in United States District
Court, Pittsburgh, for giving false testimony at a i
naturalization hearing in which he testified that a fellow
countryman from Greece was deserving of citizenship in the

: “ata



PG 92 -236

United States and had no prior convictions. According to T-4,

the individual seeking citizenship had several past arrests
which were: brought to light and HAZIDAKIS was convicted and
sentenced to serve several months in the Westmoreland County
Jail.

T-4 pointed out that HAZIDAKIS has a wife and teen-age son
living in Athens, Greece, and that HAZIDAKIS has told him ~

on many occasions that he is very proud of the son's scholastic
ability and the progress he is making in high school. T-4
stated that from conversations with HAZIDAKIS he believes

the son, in addition to attending high school in Athens, is
receiving private instructions from a tutor, and that the boy
is apparently possessed with a very high IQ.

~-4 went on to say that in his opinion HAZINAKIS is worth

at least a half million dollars in American money and would
actually like to return to. Athens, Greece, permanently if

it were not for KELLY MANNARINO and his influence over him.
T-4 explained that about a year ago HAZIDAKIS visited his
family in Athens and (indicated ‘to him before he left that

he might stay in Greece permanently. T-4 stated that several
months later, after HAZINAKTS returned from Greece and {from
conversations with him, he gathered that KELLY MANNARINO
either ordered HAZINAKIS back to the United States or sent
someone over to Greece to bring him back, ~-4 said that
HAZIDAKIS is actually terrified of KELLY “MANNARINO.and in his
opinion only stays in the United States for fear of winding
up witha bullet in his head if he refuses to follow KELLY
MANNARINO's orders.

According to T-4, HAZIDAKIS is also afraid that he is dying
of cancer and has consulted many doctors and visited
several of the major medical clinics in the United States
where. he has been assured that he does not have cancer, but
he still continues to worry over the situation needlessly.

In regard to real estate holdings in Greece, T-4 stated

that he recently learned that the office puilding owned

by HAZIDAKIS is located in Perias, Greece, rather than

Athens, and described the building as a large office -type
pbuilding, occupied for the most part by doctors and professional
men with the main floor of the building being leased out to
merchants.

T-11, who has furnished reliable ~information in the past, on
May 14, 1956,stated that ABE GOODMAN, an associate of the
MANNARINO brothers, was driving a cab in Miami, Florida, in
1953. T-1l stated that in October, 1955, she met GOODMAN

at the Hotel Nacional, Havana, Cuba, and was quite impressed
that GOODMAN could afford to livé ii such elaborate surroundings
since a few months before it was T-11's opinion that GOODMAN
did not have any money. -

{J-11 went~on to say that in conversation with GOODMAN in |
Havana, she learned that he had a part interest in the Sans
Souci, a gambling casino, with two other partners identified
only as SANTOS and HOWARD (INU), both of Miami Beach, Florida.

T-11 said that in conversations with GOODMAN she le@rned that
he maintained a sizeable bank account in the Havana Bank and
that it was obvious from the manner in which he was living
that he was doing very well financially.

In conelusion T-11 remarked that she last saw GOODMAN around
February, 1956, when he was in Pittsburgh, Pa., for the

purpose, of delivering a large sume of money to GABRIEL MANNARINO '
supposedly representing his interest from his share of “the ‘sale of the '
Sans Souci.

Mrs. ABE GOODMAN, 17631 Northeast Seventh Court, North Miami
Beach, Florida, on March221, 1958, advised SA ROBERT K. LEWIS
that her husband has been living in the Churchill Apartments,
Chicago, Illinois, for the pat thirty days and although he

is expected to return to Miami, she was unaware of his

date of arrival. Mrs. GOODMAN remarked that she will probably
join her husband in, Chicago following the sale of their home.

purpose or duration of this trip, he mentioned that while

in Cuba, he learned a great deal about the pineapple business
indicating that he is giving serious consideration to making
an investment in that field. MANNARINO also stated that he

was in Chicago, Illinois, recently but did not elaborate on
the purpose of h © that city. He explained, however,
that for the past several months, he has been locating slot
machines in the "tri-state area" for NORMAN ROTHMAN; FBI #142585B,
and added that a number of such machines have actually been
shipped to ROTHMAN, now living in Cuba. MANNARINO emphasized
that each transaction and shipment was arranged in such a fashion
that only the name of the seller and ROTHMAN, the consignee,
were made a matter of record. MANNARINO explained that in each

Influence over the Pennsylvania
State Police, Greensburg, Pa.

| ~-4, on March 10, 1958, explained that he has been closely

' associated with Captain JAMES MARONEY, Officer in Charge of
the Greensburg State Police Post since 1921 and furnished
the. following information regarding the influence of the
MANNARINO organization in Greensburg:

7-4 described Captain MARONEY as an honest and dedicated law
enforcement officer who, since his transfer to the Greensburg
Post around 1954, has often confided to him that he would
like very much to crack down on the influence of the
MANNARINO: organization but is actually powerless to do so.

By way of background explanation, ~-4 pointed that during

the period 1951-1952, after serving for a brief period as
Acting Warden of the Western State Penitentiary in Pittsburgh,
MARONEY was transferred to the Pennsylvania State Police Post
at Washington, Pa., some distance from his home in Greensburg,

Pa., and was most anxious to arrange a transfer to Greensburg
as quickly as possible in order to be near-his family. 7-4
explained that around 1954, he visited MARONBY at the
Washington State Police Post and that MAR expressed

extreme bitterness over the fact that J ,» now a ”
Congressman in the U. S. House of Rep fi Lves, who was aC,

Greensburg, but had not made good on that promise. T-4 stated
that several weeks later he happened to see DENT personally
and mentioned to’ DENT that MARONEY appeared to be very unhappy
with his assignment in Washington, Pa., to which DENT replied
that MARONEY would soon be trarisferred to Greensburg, providing
proper arrangements could be worked out with him as to the
manner in which he would enforce the law in Westmoreland

county. T-4 said that within two weeks time, MARONEY was

oe transferred to the Greensburg Post and that in many conversations

with MARONEY since that time, thelatter has implied that he was
compelled to promise TOM TANNAS, the contact man of the
MANNARINO organization and City Clerk of Arnold, Pa., that he
would not take any action in line with his official duties
to disrupt gambling in New Kensington or Arnold, Pa., without
first clearing with the County District Attorney who,
according to T-4, is backed by TANNAS and the MANNARINO
organization. ° .

T-4 said that EARL KIME (phonetic), the present District
Attorney for Westmoreland County, would like very much to
run for the vacancy on the County Bench created by the recent
death of County Judge BAUER, but that TANNAS has instructed
him to stay in his present position as District Attorney,
where he can do the most good for the MANNARINO organization.

7-4 stated that in his opinion, any approach to the present
District Attorney for Westmoreland County or First Sergeant
JOHN P, HELFENSTEIN of the Greensburg State Police Post on
behalf of the FBI or any ‘law enforcement agency would result
in the MANNARINO brothers being notified within "five minutes."
T-4 said that from personal knowledge, he knows that Sergeant
HELFENSTEIN has been paid regularly by GABRIEL MANNARINO for
the past fifteen years and would not hesitate to do anything
to protect them. t-4 added that Captain MARONEY has told him
on many occasions that he is "disgusted" over the circumstances
under which he must assume his command at the Greensburg Post
but has pointed out that he only has a few years left before
retirement and has tried to rationalize the situation in this
manner. :

In regard to influence over the Westmoreland County
Detective Bureau, T-4 stated that Chief of Detectives

BARNEY TURNER, in his opinion, is one of the most "crooked"
law enforcement officers he has ever met*since he started _
earning his living as a professional gambler back in 1917.
T-4 stated that from personal knowledge he knows that TURNER
has been accepting money. from SAM and KELLY MANNARINO ever
since he has been a county detective and is actually paid

by TOM TANNAS. ‘T-4 emphasized that if a violation within
the jurisdiction of the Westmoreland County Detective Bureau,
that concernéd the MANNARINO organization, were uncovered by
a Federal investigative agency and such information were
disseminated to the Westmoreland County Detective Bureau,
TOM TANNAS or the MANNARINO brothers would be forewarned. by
Chief TURNER immediately after the information was received.

Political Influence in New Kensington, Pa.

7-18, who has furnished reliable information ini-the past,

on March 26, 1958, stated that several years ago, [while he
was an officer of the New Kensington Chamber of Commerce , }
Mayor GARDLOCK and the New Kensington City Council were

in favor ‘of increasing local taxes and that he and several
other members of the Chamber of Commerce had a meeting with
the Mayor and the City Council to:urge them not to increase
taxes, T-18 stated that¢one of his fellow members of the
Chamber of Commerce | whom’ ‘he declined to identify, commented
at that time that hé felt something could be done to stop
the increase and that this member personally contacted
GABRIEL MANNARINO and told him that the Chamber of Commerce
was against the tax increase. 7-18 went on to say that the
following day, Mayor GARDLOCK made an announcement that
there would be no increase in taxes. T-18 stated that he
has since heard through several sources that GABRIEL MANNARINO
ealled the Mayor and informed him that taxes should not be
raised, which accounted for the Mayor's announcement.

T-19, with whom contact has been insufficient to determine
the degree of reliability but who is in a position to furnish
reliable information by reason of her employment and lengthy
residence in New Kensington, on March 26, 1958, stated in

i Third Avenue
New Kensington, Pa.

On February 28, 1958, T-4. stated that for the past fifteen

to eighteen years, the MANNARINO brothers have. had a complete
monopoly on the distribution of Hnball machines in New
Kensington and Arnold, Pa. T-4 estimated that the MANNARINO
prothers have from 300 to 400 pinball machines placed in
practically every restaurant, bar, hotel and other places of
business in the above area and that distribution is made
through the facilities of the Nu-Ken Novelty Company. 7-4,
‘who personally owns and operates a place of business in

New Kensington, Pa., explained that-he has a pinball machine, belongig
to the MANNARINO brothers and distributed through the Nu-Ken
Novelty Company, in his place of business. 7-4 explained that
the MANNARINO pinball machine in his place of business takes

in anywhere from $35 to $50 a week, adding that the MANNARINO
brothers for a numbér of years have been operating the following
scheme in regard to the collection of money from pinball
machines. According to T-4, the scheme is worked through the
collection men who make weekly calls to pick up money taken

in by the pinball machines during the week, and that for

collection man writes out a receipt to the proprietor for

only $25.00, the additional $25 being split between the
MANNARINO brothers and the proprietor. T-4 pointed out that
he has been operating under this type of an arrangment with

the MANNARINO brothers since 1952.. T-4 went on to say that

as far as the receipt is concerned in the example given above,
the proprietor's profit for tax purposes would be shown as
$12.50: while the Nu-Ken Novelty Company would déclare a ‘taxable
profit of the same amount. T-4 added that operating under this

_ arrangement, the MANNARINO brothers have been able to make

tremendous amounts of money with a minimum amount of worry
over being discovered by the Internal Revenue Service since
it would be.most difficult to prove the violation involved.

T-9, on March 7, 1958, advised that the MANNARINO brothers
have around 300 to 400 pinball machines operating in New
Kensington and Arnold, Pa., distributed through the Nu-Ken
Novelty Company with each machine believed to be averaging
between $30 and $50 a week. T-9 said that the MANNARINO
prothers. have had the New Kensington-Arnold territory. for
pinball machines since the early 1940's and that any other
dealer in pinball machines knows better than to try to a
‘encroach on their territory.

CRIMINAL INFORMANT COVERAGE

PG 545-C

PG 564-c
WALTER J. SHARKEY, PCI ‘
MIKE ZERVOS, PCI

PCI WALTER J. SHARKEY has been confined to his home and

place of business since last contacted for the purpose of
assisting and caring for, his teenage daughter who is recuperating
from a serious leg injury suffered as a result of a fall while
horseback riding. Consequently, SHARKEY has not been in a
position to actively develop information but he has indicated
that his daughter's health is improving to the point where he
will soon be free to develop additional information in this

case.

The lead to recontact former PG 511-C has not been covered
due to the unavailability of the informant.

CHRISTINE SUPRANO, 610 Second Avenue, New Kensington, Pa.,
on March 12, 1958, advised SAS NORMAN T,. THOMPSON and
RICHARD GORDON DOUCE that as a result of her involvement

in a WSTA investigation conducted by the FBI, she is no
longer permitted to enter the Laetus Club in New Kensington.

mothensOvér the way in which she conducts her social life,
she plans to leave home within the next few weeks to live
with her brother and sister-in-law in Georgia permanently.

SUPRANO was very hostile and refused to enter into a

discussion concerning. JOHN FONTANA or the MANNARINO brothers 4
adding that she did not want to become involved in the

situation and had no intention of cooperating with the FBI.

In the opinion of the interviewing agents, SUPRANO is a -

completely unreliable and unpredictable teenager. Consequently,

she will not be recontacted for development as a PCI.

CONNIE OLZEWSKI, peautician, Kaufmann's Department Store,
“Pittsburgh, on March 11, 1958, was re-interviewed by ‘i
SAS THOMPSON and DOUCE for the purpose of further. examining

her potential as an informant and also to develop, if

possible, further information regarding her dates with

GABRIEL MANNARINO as previously reported by PG 564-c on ~
_| December 11, 1957. OLZEWSKI was extremely hostile and flatly 5
‘\nefused to enter into.a discussion regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO
emphasizing that she was absolutely inm position. to furnish }
information regarding his activities. She again flatly pars
jidenied ever accompanying GABRIEL MANNARINO on out-of-town ia}
trips and made it very clear that she did not want to become \
involved with anything that had anything to do with the J
MANNARINO brothers. OLZEWSKI explained that she is nearing

the completion of her apprenticeship at the Kaufmann Beauty

Salon and will soon receive her license after which she fully ~~~
intends to leave the city with one of her co-workers to open

a beauty shop, possibly in Florida.

i} Following the interview on March 11, 1958, several attempts
were made by the interviewing agents to make an appointment :
with OLZEWSKI for an interview either at her home in : }
| Glassmere,. Pa., or at the Pittsburgh Office but she absolutely

i refused to meet or cooperate with the interviewing agents.

H In view of OLZEWSKI's attitude, no further attempts will be

i made to develop her as an informant. :
