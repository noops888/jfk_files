tance activities as a result of their having suffered the most at
the hands of the current administration after being largely
responsible for its obtaining power, He also provided a general
strategic plan of Oriente Province in which he defined the main
areas in which guerrilla elements can survive and how they can be
reached from coastal resupply points, His ability to do this is
based upon his being a native of the area and one who has been
primarily interested in its geography due to his former large
agriculture holdings there. =

8. COMMENTS AND FLANS: While no spectacular achievements are

resulting from AMDENIM-1's efforts at this point he is Steadily

gave his fishermen for not realizing more information out of the
vefugecs they met at Anguila Key while waiting for their inside
contact, They had failed to adequately debrief two young men, who
had succeeded in surviving in PBRUMEN for over two months on their
own, on the basis that they were too young to be knowledgeable.
