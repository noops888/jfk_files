INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA;

NEUTRALITY MATTERS

Previous investigation has reflected that the

Movimento Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria

(MIRR) is an anti-Castro organization of Cuban exiles

headquagtered in Miami under the leadership of DI. Orlando

Bosch Avila.

On December 28, 1963, the U. S. Customs and U. s.

Coast Guard seized two boats, explosives and a plane in the

Miami area to stop the raid of the MIRR against Cuba.

Since that time Dr. Bosch has bees drawing up various plans

for additional attacks.

Current Developments

P& BJA/GCL

on May 11, 1964, MM T-l, a Cuban exile who is

friendly to some of

Bosch's close

associates, furnished

the following information.

Bosch has drawn up plans for a joint sea and

air raid designed to sink the las Villas", a 300 foot

Cuban freighter which is scheduled to have recently

departed Marseilles, France, for Havana,

Cuba,

with a load

of heavy equipment

aboard such

as railroad stock or buses.

Bosch planned to have this attack take place off the cöast

of South Florida somewhere along the sea route normally

DECLASSI

used by ships proceeding toward Havana from Europe.

MM T-1 advised that

there are two sea routes

ON

normally used by vessels coming from Europe to

Havana.

One of these routes approaches the coast of Florida at

a point directly north of the Little Bahama Bank in the

Bahama Islands. The other approach is through the

Northwest Providence Channel which is directly south of

AII INFORGrand Bähama' Island.

Re: MIRR

MM T-1 said that on May 11, 1964, pursuant to

Bosch's direction, Jerry fuller of Miami was scheduled to

rent a 26 foot Bertram speedboat from Bertram's Boatyard. Fla

It is to be noted that Jerry Fuller is the brother of

Bobby Fuller, who was executed by Fidel Castro when he

was captured

on an abortive raid from Miami in 1960.

Fuller was scheduled to take possession of this Bertram

Speedboat at 8:00 A.M. on the morning of May 12, 1964,

and to proceed with it to the Crandon Marina on Key

Biscayne where it would be turned over to two or more

Cubans, identity unknown.

The speedboat would then proceed

by sea immediately on the same day to Palm Beach, Florida,

where Bosch has obtained a safe house located at

an unknown

address near the Lake Worth Inlet.

Two homemade torpedoes equipped with radio

directional controls were scheduled to be transported on

the night of May 11, 1964, via unknown motor

vehicle from

to the above-mentioned safe house at Palm Beach.

torpedoes were made by Orlando Ramirez, the bomb

Fla

"expert" of the MIRR. Ramirez participated in the December

28, 1963 raid attempt. These two torpedoes were allegedly

concealed at a private residence on N. W. 29th Avenue near

9th Street, Miami.

MEMPER OF SUBTECT ORGANIZATION

The MIRR men at the Palm Beach safe house are

supposed to maintain a lookout offshore fron a small fishing

boat for the

"Las Villas". The Bertram speedboat under

command of Orlando Ramirez was scheduled to be used as

attack boat in launching the two torpedoes against the

"Las Villas".

According to Bosch's plans, the sea attack is to

be coordinated with an air suryet lance ere, a Cuban

cessna plane piloted by Evelio/Alpizar

Fla CuisHt

pilot, who also participated in the December

28, 1963,

raid attempt.

Alpizar is scheduled to be accompanied

by another cuban, possibly Jesus Sanchez/Martinez,

who

also participated in the December

28, 1963 raid attempt.

According to MM T-l, Bosch has instructed

Alpizar to conduct an aerial surveillance twice dally

on way 14, 13 and 14, 1964, of the sea lanes off the

Re: MIRR

Florida east coast to locate the "Las Villas" as it

approaches the Florida coast.

The plane: and speedboat

are scheduled to coordinate their movements with the

aid of walkie-talkie radios.

After the "Las Villas"

is sighted, the plane is supposed to return to the

Florida mainland in order to pick up a number of 25 lb.

napalm bombs at a predesignated spot:

Laredo Rodriguez,

treasurer of the MIRR, is in charge of storing the

napalm bombs and making them available to Alpizar after

the "Las

Villas" is sighted.

The napalm is supposed to be dropped on the

"Las Villas" immediately prior to the torpedo attack

in order to divert attention from the Bertram speedboat.

MM T-1 said that Bosch is not personally

participating in either the air or sea attack, however,

he plans to use this operation, if successful, as a means

of raising further funds for additional attacks against

Castro.:

MM T-I is of the opinion that Bosch is motivated

by personal reasons to obtain publicity, fame and money,

while at the same time having a desire to do something

against the Castro regime.
