, “Previous investigation has reflected that the

lovimi ento/Insurrecional_de Rectiperacion Revolucionaria
an anti-Castro organization of Cuban exiles

ered in Miami under the leadership of Dr. Orlando

On December 28, 1963, the U. S. Customs and U.S,
Coast Guard seized two boats, explosives and a. plane in the
Miami area to stop tke raid/of the. MIRR against Cuba,
Since that time Dr. Bosch has been drawing up various plans
for additional attacks.

Current Developments

On May 11, 1964, MM T-1, a Cuban exile who is
friendly. to some of Bosch's close associates, furnished
the following information.

Bosch has drawn up plans for a joint sea and
air raid designed to sink th as Villas", a 300 foot
Cuban freighter which is scheduled to have recently
departed Marséilles, France, for Havana, Cuba, with a load’
of heavy équipment aboard such as railroad stock or buses.
Bosch planned to have this attack take placé off the coast
of South Florida somewhere along the sea route normally
used by ships proceeding toward Havana from Europe.

5 MM T-1 advised that there are two sea routes
normally used by vessels coming from Europe to Havana.
One of these routes approaches the coast of Florida at
a point directly north of the Little Bahama Bank in the
Bahama Islands. The’ other approach is through the
7 Northwest Providence Channel which is directly. south of
4 sup rusorGXamd CBEHWHE Island.

Re: MIRE

Bosch's direction, Jérry Fuller of Miami was: scheduled to
rent a. 26 foot Bertram speedboat from Bertram's Boatyard. £/a
It is to be noted that Jerry Fuller is the brother of a aeerEEETECEEEE
Bobby Fuller, who was executed by Fidel Castro when he

was captured on an abortive raid from Miami in 1960.
Fuller'was scheduled to take possession of this Bertram
speedboat at 8:00 A, M, on the morning of May 12, 1964,

and to proceed with it to the Crandon Marine on Kay

Biscayne where it would be tiirned over to two or more

Cubans, identity unknown. The speedboat would then proceed
by sea immediately on the same day to Palm Beach, Florida,
where Bosch has obtained a safe house located at an unknown
address near the Lake Worth Inlet.

-MM T-1 said sip May 11, 1964, pursuant to

Two homemade torpedoes equipped with radio

directional controls were schéduled to be transported on

the might of May 11, 1964, via unknown motor vehicle from

Miami to the above-mentioned safe house at Palm Beach. LL*
These torpedoes were made by OrlanddxRamirez, the bomb eeterereiemntt
"expert" of the MIRR. Ramirez participated in the December

28, 1963 raid attempt. These two torpedoes were allegedly
‘concealed at a private residence on N. W. 29th Avenue near

9th Street, Miami. MEMPER OF SUBIECT ORGANIZATION

The MIRR men at the Palm Beach safe house are
supposed to maintain a lookout offshore from a small fishing
boat for the "Las Villas". The Bertram speedboat under
command of Orlando Ramirez was scheduled to be used as the
attack boat in launching the two torpedoes against the
"Las Villas".

According. to Bosch's plans, the sea attack is to
be coordinated with an air suryeillan and attack by a ob
Cessna plane piloted by Evelio/Alpizar\Perez, a Cuban fle eu
pilot, who also participated in the December 28, 1963,
raid attempt. Alpizar is schéduled ‘to be accompanied
by another Cuban, possibly Jesus Ranches tinez, who Fle
also participated in the December ‘28, 1963 raid attempt. 3A
According to MM T-1, Bosch has instructed aaa
Alpizar to conduct an aerial surveillance twice daily
on May 12, 13 and 14, 1964, ofthe sea lanes off the

Re: MIRR

Florida éast coast to locate the "Las Villas" as it
approaches the Florida coast. The planeé' and speedboat
are scheduled. to coordinate their movements with the
aid of walkie-talkie radios. After the "Las Villas"

is sighted, the plane is stipposed to return to. the
Florida’ mainland in order to pick up a number of 25 1b.-
napalm. bombs. at a predesignated spot. Laredo Rodriguez,
treasurer of the MIRR, is in charge of storing the’
napalm bombs and making them available to Alpizar after
the "Las Villas" is sighted.

The napalm is supposed to be dropped on the
“Las Villas" immediatély prior to the torpedo attack.
in order to divert attention from the Bertram speedboat.

MM T-1 said that Bosch is not personally
participating in either the air or Sea attack, however,
he plans to use this operation, if successful, as.a.méans
of ‘raising further funds for additional attacks against
Castro. MM T-l is of the opinion that. Bosch is motivated
by personal reasons to obtain publicity, fame and money,
while:at the same time having a desire to do something
against the Castro regime,
