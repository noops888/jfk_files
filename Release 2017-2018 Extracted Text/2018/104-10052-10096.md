DISPATCH SECRET — HMMA~21845

On 5 June 1963 Douglas J, FEINGLASS, Staff Agent, arrived in
Mexico to replace Howard G, SAFARANO, the Station translator for Russian
language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines. SAFARANO
departed PCS on 18 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations
officer, FEINGLASS' usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability
to transcribe.the Spanish portion-of the reels from the Soviet coverage, This,
. despite Headquarters assurance that he could do these transcriptions, Howevey
he has settled into outside living conditions with a minimum of difficulty,
For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing the
Spanish portion ofthe above take, There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes
numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS
was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish. The backlog is. being
retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives, In addition to the Russian trans-
crptions, FEINGLASS also clips the transcripts for individual dossiers thus
relieving the Station Case Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task,
After the arrival of HORSFALL, the Mexico Station will review requirements
for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of
FEINGLASS,

In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested)
full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines. In addition, Thomas G,
URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the
LIENVOY tap center to review the traffic on a current basis,

4, Exploitation of LIENVOY information,

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided
details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data,
In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance
information when reservations were made, Confirmation of the travel is,
of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might

be U.S, citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for
political or other reasons, On 20 May 1963 an English speaker identifying
himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political
asylum for himself, his wife and seven children, Subsequent investigation
revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S, Embassy in Mexico,
Appropriate U,S, agencies were advised of Subject’s contact with the Soviet
Embassy,

5. Liaison,

During this reporting period there were no meetings between the
Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular coatact was
maintained with LIELEGANT and LIERGO,

6, Security.

There were no security incidents within the project during this
taonth, As reported in MEXI-5170, 26 June 1963, the true name ofa
KUBARK case officer was revealed to the Cuban Embassy by a caller who
refused to identify himself, From the transcript it appeared that the Cuban
Embassy was not interested in making coatact with the caller who claimed to
have details of KUBARK operations in 1 Mexico,

7, Technical,

Amold AREHART, staff agent, has kept the equipment working

effectively. As Headquarters is being advised by separate cable, the Mexico
Station does not plan to replace the present LIENVOY equipment until the next
Presidential candidate is named, assuming of course that this will occur within}
the next few weeks,

8. Personnel,

On i7 June Robert B, RIGGS resumed meeting Arnold AREHART and| |
routine case officer functions for LIENVOY, Gregory PARMUTH meets }
Douglas J, FEINGLASS daily to deliver and receive the Soviet Embassy j
traffic, PARMUTH's assistance in obtaining living quarters and necessary
sterile office furniture was responsible for the ease with which FEINGLASS {|
was able to settle into his outside staff agent status,

In the opinion of Thomas G. URQUHART, who has spent some time | |
inside the tap center, Arnold F, AREHART is doing a commendable job in
the management of the center, In addition, AREHART has a general aware-
ness of the take from each line, When leads of interest appear, he notifies
the Station immediately so that action can be taken,

Willard C, CURTIS contacts LIENVOY-2 when the Station desires
contact with the Mexicans directly or when AREHART is absent,

9. Production,

Tne volume of paper produced by this project is hardly reflected in
formal disseminations, operational cables, and dispatches which numbered
39 during June, The daily summaries, the transcripts from two Czech lines,
five Soviet lines, and five Cuban lines are retained for background use in
Station files. They could be more fully exploited for reporting purposes if

ersonnel were available.

‘There is attached a list of reports, cables and dispatches forwarded} |
to Headquarters during this month. |
