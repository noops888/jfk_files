Ne appreciate the detailed progreas report on KDAFGHAN

subaitted by reference.

The complete description of KDAFGHAN

personnel,

working routine, facilities and equipment was very

belpful in understanding how this project functions.

•2.

Regarding your request for WOACRE advice and guidance

on hot-wiking the lines running into the gatehouse and consulate,

we have discussed this possible operation with WOACRE bere who

offer

the following.comments.

first, to accomplish a bot-mike

installation, you must be able to get access to the telephone

wires.

If you can gain access to the phone lines,

It would be

possible to hot-uike the telephone uithout getting to the instru

ment itself. ' However, a non-access system Ilke this will not

work if the target line goes through a switchboard or if there

are multiple telephone lines going into the same instrument.

Baged on your description of the embassy telephone syster,

1t

would

appear to rule out a hot-aike operation unless you can Ilad

and

sain access to a single line that does not so through a switch-

board.

Any such operation,

•It one is proposed,

would have to be

unilateral because the non-access systen is not for exposure to

11a1aon.

It 18 possible that your interests in this operation

could be served egually well by an audio penetratioa of the

gatehouse.

Such a penetration could be made by a carry-in

"quick plant" type of transmitter.

Perhaps one of your agents who

regularly visite the gatehouse could be employed to carry in a

device, or you could exploit KDTUCK-4's close friendship with

KDACOUSTIC-11 to get a transmitter into the target.

appreciate your comments.

Roferences:

A. HNNA-11900, 2 May 1972

MEXICO CITY-20107

C. DIRECTOR-280180

Operatloual Activities:

This Project continued as before

portion of this period with KDAFGHAN providing photo

coverage for oight lou's per day, five days per wook, of the ANFINk

installation.

In April the prineipal agent, KDAFGHAX-1, was provided

with new photographic cquipment to improve the quality of the take.

This later proved unuseable

as sunlight playing on the mirror of

the lens was plainly

visible from the target area in the afternoons.

The Aront returned to the use of his old equipmont. It being the

current Case Officer's practice to hold nearly all mectings with

this Agent in the Case Officer's auto about once every two wecks we

decided to terminate the KDAFGHAN satchouse as unnecessary.

KDAFGHAN-1 was notifled of this In carly June and nearly collapsed.

The salchouse had been his refuge from the Op and his mothei,

KDAFGHAN-". We intonded to put him on vacation when It was decided

(References B and C) to torminate him and his Project.

portion of this porlod was then spent in closing down the operation,

removing equipment fron the OP, restoring the OP to its original

condition and then assisting the Agents in their preparations for

resettling to Madrid.

All of this was finally accomplished by

31 July and the Agents were formally teiminated on 1 August.

2. Security: There were no security incidents during this

period.

3.

Aycit

Personnel: The termination of these two Agents

came as a sovere shock to both; they were not prepared for it.

They have adapted fairly well and now are looking forward to

their new life in Spain. They intend to depart Mexico for Madrid

on 1 September.

4.

production:

Production for this period was normal until

20 June when TE ceased permanently.

5.

Administrative/Finance: There was a laige amount of

administratfve detaff Favolving Headquarters and the Madrid

Station in the resettlement of these two Agents.

This has been

discussed in

separate cable traffic.

Costs exceeded the programmed

• amount becauso of the lage severance pay paid both agents who had

over ten ycars scivice

each.

KDAFGHAN-I was paid U.S. $8, 170.00

and KDAFGIAN-2 was

paid U.S. $2,228.48.

6.

Plans: We have no plans to replace KDAFGHAN with another

strictly photo-surveillance project.

The production does not

Justify the cost.

However, we do have plans to obtain a multi-

purpose baschouse in the area that can seive as a site for taking

photos when necessaly,

serve as a LP for future audio operations

against AFINK,

and as a-base from which to dispatch a future

surveillance team.

The PBRUMEN section has already started the

search for

agent assets who, in turn, can look for in appropriate

site.

The acquisttion of the lalter will be the most difficult as

rental property is at a premium

in the AMFINK area. Headquarters

will be kept Informed

of our progress.

factor in exposiny him sooncr or later.

note. in passing that his home telephone lino shares

the same polo distrtbution box as that of the AWFINK

One Item that becomos ovident when reviering KDAFGHAN

filos is his repeated failure (with some few

exceptions) to get photographs of suspects or agents

that the Station knows visited ANFINK while he was

4.

Given the above the Station decided to mount an operation

designed to determine once and for all il tho KDAFGHANS were

either under control by AMSTAFF ot if their activities were beins

monttored by audlo coverage of the Safchouse or OP site.

DCOS designed

a sophisticated sconario to be played out by the

Case Officer which would; one by

one, eltminate or prove each of

the above possibilities.

No other Station assots were used, this

to eliminate

any possibility that they might be the source

Without going

the plan basically

involved letting chough information slip bit by bit to KDAFGHAN-I

so that- he, "or

draw the wanted conclusion; namoly, that 201-327262 was worklng

for us.

Unfortunately,

just as we

got into the preliminary stages

201-327262 was tecalled.

It is our opinion that the

operation had not yet gone fai enough to consider this recall as

proof of our suspicions, but that it was mere coincidence.

bother us.

At one meeting KDAFGHAN-i mentioned (or let slip) that the AMFINK

chauffeur had gone on vacation.

While the Station was rware of

this we nic hard put to understand how ho knew it.

the: same conversation with the Casa Officer (perhaps realizing

his mistake?) KDAFGHAV-1 began

to backtrack and started to talk

about how he

"thought" the chauffeur "might have" gone on vacation.

The second point tis that he almost invariably reports within

few days when an AMFINK employee drops out of sight.

This attempt by the

2.

While reviewing this activity, we were struck by

the thought which has occurred to others in the rast

to why KhArGias 1, an educated and reportedly intelligent

individual, has been villing to devote the last ten years

to this dull and very routine effort.

It is intricult to

draw a completely satistying answer

to this question from

the files.

The security aspects aside, the Station is

probably doing NDAFGild-l a favor,

terms of his aental

health, by forcing him to look outside his small and

insular world and

seet a new fors

of employnent.

frequent references to KDAFGIlAN-l's pent up nervousness

contained in the Station's reporting indicates that...

KDAFGILAN-1's obsession with his work nay finally be catch-

ing up with him.

While we are more than a little ambivalent concern-

the ovor-all value of this activity as presently consti

tuted, given tho priority need for coverage of the AYSTAFF

personnel stationed at the PBRUNEN Embassy and the relative

dearth of PBRUMEN target access agcnts, we believe that this

activity should be continued.

We share the Station's concorn

abour our inability to identify the photographs of non;

PBRUMEN personnel who visit the Embassy or Consulate, but

appreciate the difficult technical problems involved.

more positive note, the recent group of photographs of

PBRUMEN Embassy staffers forwarded to Headquarters for review

Ne assume

the contents of Reference C that when and if a new OP

site team has been recruited and & new site obtsines,

eidoris will be made by the Station to increase the identifi-

cation of visitors to the PBRUNEN installation concerned.

Meanwhile, the high rate of identification of PBRUVEN visitors

to the Embassy currently being achieved by the Station

testifies

to your determined efforts to obtain the maximum "take" from

this operation.

In conclusion, we concur with the Station's plans

to continue this operation and to improve the identification

of non-PBRUMEN visitors to the PBRUMEN Embassy.

IMPNOTING COVERAGE

3.

The full potential of the LIOXIO%-1 operation 1s

hampered by the lack of an audio

installation

at the LIRING

fatehouse covered by the LIONIO% and 2 observation post.

An audio

installation would serve,

to Identify

the individuals who

normally

identify themselves

•to

the satchouse attendant.

The

Station is.constahtly. examining the possibility of an audio

installation

at this point.

There are a number of Station assets

who have eccisional

access to the gatehouse,

and it is conceivable

that one-of them

could place a quick plant

device, provided

, security

conditions are favorable:

The Station assets who visit

the LIRING complex

approximately once a weck

ale:

LIRELIC-1;

LITAINT-2; LIHACK-4 and to a lesser

extent LIBANGLE-1.

of this

grOUp, LITAINT-2 appears to have gained the confidence among

LIRIG personnel, for

whom he has provided services

and purchased

with Station assistance, clothing and other items outside Mexico.

Prior, to making any

installation, Station will submit an opera-

tional plan for llcadquarters approval.

Station is also Installing

a TV camera monitor in the LIONION basehouse to cover the LIRING

consulate.

• The installation will be coordinated with a robot!

photo camera so that photos can be taken of persons whom LIONION-1

determines to be of Station interest.

PRODUCTION

The LIONION production has remained virtually constant

since the primaly objectives

ot the installation seldom change.

Except for specific individuals, is similar

as in the case of AVDIME-l,

the general production material

to the contents

of

paragraph

4 of Reference.

In view of this it would be redundant

to repeat the entire paragraph.

COVER AND SECURITY

5. There were

no security

problems in the LIONION operatión

the period of this report.

The Case Officer visited thel

basehouse once during the hours

of darkness.

As reported pre-

viously: meetings with LIONIOY-l are held in his safehouse,

which is in another section of Mexico City.

The question

FINAYCES

There were no changes in the projected LIONION expendi

tures reported in the paragraphs, under FINAYCES, in Reference

dispatch.

PLANS

The objectives

outlined in paragraph 8,

Reference,

continue in effect.

Station is going ahead in the installation

of the TV monitoring system

The Station is also examining the possibility of

acquiring a second baschouse directly across the street trom

the LIRING gatehouse.

There we two five: story apartment bulldings

which would provide a better view, of the LikING comples from a

technical point of view,

particularly if an apartment above the

third flooi can be rented.:

In the event an apartment can

be located and rented across from

the gatehouso,

the occupant!

would provide photographic and visual surveillance of the gatehouse

and internai grounds.

The LOVIOss, if they stay where they are nt, would then

concentrate on the consulate and

limited coverage of

internal LIRING grounds. However,

if they can locate suitable

quarters on the rear street perpendicular to the one on which

the main gate is located, they idenlly could cover the consulate

as woll us a third, little known entrance into the LIRiNG compound

which LITAINT-2 has reported being used by student visitors late

current LIONION basehouse, this third entrance

cannot be seen at all.

Finally, the Station continues to explore the

possivility

of installing an

ANCHAMPAGNE-l's r'eference to "unn vieja"

monitoring the

The Station discussed with LIONION-2

herself whether she

thought she might have been singled out

by LIRING or whether there were any other people near by who

might have. been identified by LIRING as snoopers.

• While the Station does not rule out the fact LIONION2

may

be suspect in the eyes of LIRING,

she does remember that

LIRING-2 would occasionally come out

oi year's ago, look ncross the street and point up to ino apart-

ment buildings there and shake his fist. Ou examination, thoro

are two apartments directly across fron the front sate, each

6 floors high and with private apartments on each floor.

LIONION-2 does not know if there me any "little old ladies"

residing in any of them now (see para i below) but none of these

apartments have been

vacated during the past several years.

Her, and the Station's suess is that LIkING probably suspects

an occupant of these apartments as being the one monitoring

the

activitles of LIRING personnel because of the strategic location

of these buildings.

The LIONION baschouse is at the

other end of the block, across from the offices of LIRING-13.

There is an old couple living in the house next to LIONION, but

the wife is considerably older than LIONION-2.

Regular photographie coverage of

suspended from 1 through 25 day 1960, durtng which

Since he had not

nature of his work requires him to remain behind the

camol'a

In a small closet in the baschouse, the Statloni

considered it imporoat that he leave his gork and relax for

a while.

LIOSIOr-; ortginally requested a five-weck vacation,

which the Station could have willingly granted if the LIONION

operation could have been continued during that poriod by

someone, else; bur LIONlOy-l reported that, while his mother

was.

able to

take. his place for short periods of time during

the days

the responsibtlity and long hours would be too much

for. a person of her age and bad eyesight for an extended

period

of time. The Statlon considered it unwise to havo a

substitute take over during LIONION-l's absence.

He agroed

to take a three-ween tour of Europe this year, and he will

be allowed to take mother thice weeks. next year If he wishes.

FIXANCES below.

Enerrency contact arrange-cats wore made

between LIONION-2 and the undersigned to pass any priority

requirements which sight arise during LIONIO-l's absence.

LIONIO'-2. remained at the Listening Post during the entire

period in order not to leave the basehouse equipment unguarded.

Except for the

lack of coverage during these two weeks, there

were

no significant changes in the photographic coverage of

LIRING during the reporting period.

4.

Andio - LISANPAN/DOC.

As reported in paragraph D2

of reference, LIONIONl live-monitored the LISANPAN/DOG

traffie from 0800 to: 1730 hour's daily.

When he left for

Europe on d Jay 1969:

the carrier current transmission of this

traffic from LISANPAY/LISASI to the LIONION-1. Unsehouse was

discontinued.

It was decided to let LISANPAl-l record various

portions of this

traffic during the two-week absence of

LIONION-1 for

evaluation by Richard C.' HABOUSH.

The purpose

was to determine

whether continued recording by either

LISANPAN-1 or LIONIOX-I would be merited by the Information

obtained.

As previously reported (MEXICO CITY-0191 and

AMA-37166), LISAMPAN DOG WaS loSt on elther 6 or 7 May 1969. 7

4s a result, LIONIO%-T has received no audio since his return

from Europe

on 25 May 1969.

Arter the loss of LISANPAN/DOG,

the Station considered running a straight tap to the LIONION-1

baschouse,

but decided that the security risk was

too great,

particularly in view of the fact that the target LIRING line

is already monitored by LIENVOY.

Miscellaneous.

During the Station's casing of the

residence of Chief,. LIRING in May and June 1969 to determine

tlie feasibility of mounting an audio operation against that

target, LIONIOY-1 extended his coverage of the LIRING target

beyond his usual closing hour of 1730 until 0130.

The purpose

of this extended coverage was

to monitor the activities of

certain LIRING personnel and establish their routine pattern

of notivity in preparation for a possible

entry into Chief,

LIRING's residence.

This casing was discontinued on 4 June

when it was determined that the residence was under apparent

surveillance.

The duration

of the extended coverage

by LIONION-l was not loag enough to

establish the regular

Subsequent to the loss of LISANPAN audio operctions,:

the Station removed all audio equipment and associated

WOACRE material. from

the LIONION-1 basehouse,

him only with commercial photographic equipment.

The one exception to this is the pulse camera.

The

Station would apprectate Headquarters'

comments on

the use and value of the take from the pulse camera.

SECURITY

7.

The only incident during the recording period which

had a bearing on the security of

the LIONION operation was

the loss of LISAMPAN/ DOG.

As far as the Station can determine,

the carrier current transmitter was not in operation atlthe

the countermeasure

sweeps were being conducted in the

vicinity of DOG.

Since. this was the only connection between

LIONION and LISAMPAN,

the Station does not feel that LIONION

could have been compromised.'The entire question of the damage

resulting from the loss of the LISAMPAN operations is under

study and will shortly be the subject of a separate dispatch.

FINANCES

8.

During the reporting period, routine LIONION expend-

ttures

amounted to $22, 701.00 MN

(US$1, 816.08).

In addition,

LIONION1 was given a gift of US$250.00 prior to his departure

for Europe on 4 May:

Since LIONION-l's request for five

weeks leave could not be approved for operational reasons,

he was given the gift to help finance the air fare for a

second trip to Europe in a year cr so if he vents to complete

his origtnal plans.

LIONION Progress Report,_ 1 January: through 31 March_1968

ACTION RIGUISID - MISININCES

BACKGROUND

LIONION provides WOFIRM with a fixed photographic surveillance

capability of LIRING, a base for the radio dispatch of the LIENBRACE

Survoillance Team, and a Listening Post (LP) for LISAMPAN/DOG and

BAKER.

The basehouse is manned by LIONION-1 and LIONION-2, both

fully qualified to handle all of the equipment installed in the site.

This team has operated the same basenouse for photographic sur-

veillance of LIRING for nearly six years.

CORNBURY has alse been successful in running

The

two audio installationthus provide LIONION-1 with a kreater capa-

bility to identity visitors to LIRING (through live monttoring) and

thus affix names

to photographs he takes.

Previously, the identifi-

cation of visitors to LIRING required considerable time and effort

but 1n

the short period of LIONION's audio capability this effort

has decreased

measurably.

See HNMA-31292,

14 March 1968.

LISAMPAN/

1. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND REPORTING

Project LIOVION Is a long-term operational support project designed

to provide fixed photographic,

technical,

and physteal surveillance of

the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

objective is to provide for a mochanisn which

can fulfill various.

miscellancos PBRUMEN support type requirements.

The LIONION base

house; which

serves as the photographic base, an L/P and provides o

radio-dispatching base for the LLEMBRACE surveillance team, contimes

to be manned by LIONION-1 and LIONION-2.

The last regularly schednlod

LIONION progiess report, covering the porlod 1 Aprii through 30 Junc

1967, was forwarded in reference.

2. AGENT CONTACT AND PERFORMINCE

During the period under review,

LIONION-] was seen 18 times and

LIONION 2

on four occasions in regular operational neetings.

Meetings

were hold in the LIOVION safchouse,

in the Casc Officer's home after

dark, in restaurants oi in moving vehicles after street-corner pick-

ups.

Other than the intentional rotation of

meeting sites and times:

no changes were made in the LIONION conmunications systens.

As noted in reference, LIOYION-1 was hospitalized for emergency

sulgely to tieat a perforated ulcer

on 27 June.

LIONION-1 did not

renover sufficiently to provide fulltime coverage until mid-July, a

fact, given his conscientious nature, lowered his morale slightly.

Hovever, after returning to fulltime work and receiving assurances

from the Case Officer,

LIONION-1 perked-up considerably.

Since that

time, LIONION-1 has perfcied in the exemplary manner which the Sta-

tion

has come to expect of him.

Other than cited above,

thore have

been no agent handling, control, or morale problems during the report-

ing period.

3. AGENT PERFORMANCE: AND MORALE

Not withstanding the boring and difficuit nature of cais

operational assignment, LIONION-1 continues to purform in in

SinjeC ls indeed & ligniy mutivated ageat

as indicated by his willingness to perforn this rather menia?

task day after day, when,

with his educational background he

undoubtedly could obtain more interesting and more lucrative

the Station assisted LIONION-1 in the

purchase of a new ongthe for his vehicle.

This unexpected gesture

was greatly appreciated by LIONION-l and

aD immediate change for

the better in Subject's frame of mind was noted.

1.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

(a)

Throughout the period under review, ProJect LIoNION

continued to provide the Station with the invaluable photographic

coverage of the targets.

In addition, LIONION-1 continued to

provide interesting observations on the personalities and activ

ites of the personnel working in the target.

After years of

observation, LIONIONal can virtually tell the frano of mind and

disposition of the regular inhabitants.

LIONION-1's obserrationa

on the Subject of reference (B)

wero most valuable to the Station

in the plaining of the recruitment of this individual.

In

addition, LIONION l provided radio dispatching support during

this recruitment operation; without which, the attempt would

have been virtually impossible.

(b) Statistically, LIONION-] provided approximately 1600

individual photographs

of persons entering and leaving tho

target Ambassy (which he printed and developed himself) and

approximately 2100 feet of film coverage of

the Consulate.

(c) There wore no intelligence disseminations from this

operation during the reporting period, since as previously

described Project LIONION, primarily a support type operation.

(d) Details have previously been submitted to Headquarters

concerning LIONION l's support in the AMBRATLE operation.

5. PLANS

As noted in paragraph 14 of reference (A), Station plans to

utilize LIONION-1 and LIONION-? As L/P operators in support of

the LISANPAN operation. Other than this, there are no significant

operational or administrative changes planned for the ensurin

1.. Two promising new operations in the PBRUMEN fleld are now In cho

developmental etage:

A.

Through(LITAMIL-3 Che Station has recrufted a barber

who used co viait the Embassy regularly to cut the

hair of PBRUMEN Ambasandors and staff employees. Thia

man has been a long-time frlend of 1-3.

Ile has been

reintroduced Into the Embassy and has vlotted there on

three occasions recently.

He does not know who he in

working for beyond L-3.

The Abassador has proven to

be somewhat of a skinflint, paying only 10 peson for

a haircut whereas the golia price for a haircut at une's

home or office la 20 pesos.

To dace 1-3 has paid the

barber a total uí lOO pesos (supplled by the Station).

It 1a planned to put him on a retainer of about 250

pesos @ month (920 US sy) with bonuses as appropriate.

The Scocion thus has a straight razor at the Ambaosador's

chront and, while an accidental slip night seem worth-

while, it ly bolieved that this new asset will eventually

prove useful in placing cechnical devices Inalde.

On his

last visit he did his haircutting in on upsinira room only

o wall's thickness from the DGI center.

Full PRQ data

and nore extensive derails will be forvarded promptly.

MICROFILM

Reference: EMMA 26006, 30 April 1965

1. During the second quarter of 1965 (the perlod covered by thia

report) cha LIONION operation experienced some technical difficulties which

have not been solved to date. Normal coverage of the target was obtained

chroughout the month of April with the exposure of some 600

feet of film by

the pulse camera and 28 rollo of 36-exposure I51-X by tle Pentax/Balacope

Inscallation.

Normal coverage contlnued untll 27 May at which time the pulse

camera becano Inoperative owing. to a burned-out delve motor.

Tho comera was

removed and forwarded. to Headquarters for necessary repadra and a Pentax with

a 180 mm calephoto lens was r18ged as a temporary aubsellute for coverage of

the Consulate entrance.

On 16 June a reconditioned pulso camera was recelved

and tonediately placed in service.

Unfortunately, this unlt falled on 27 June

and was renoved. A faulty shutter motor was to blame.

Thie camere was aldo

forwarded to Headquarters for repalr and the Pentax/ 180 mm rig was again set

up. This rig la being operated by LIONION-?.

Morale of boch agents continues high, expeclally in view of the

excellent service Rendquartern performed in "Isauing" new PBRUMEN passports

for these agents.

Both were antounded to see their own signatures expertly

forged in the new documenta.

Headquartere help in chia documontaclon

Installation.

Since the Station indicated in paragraph 3 a

of reference that a separate project "ill be prepared to cover.

project file number was requested for bioNioN in four parts.

The Station will be notifiod of this new number in the normal

LIPEAT/LIERODE (50-6-32/8) - Both the cryptons

and file number have been retained. to refer to the original

purpose, normal LIFEAT coverage of PBRUMEN installations.
