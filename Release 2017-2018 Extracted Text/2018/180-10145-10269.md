Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles

Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1940

constitution. Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would be

established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passec

at beginning of his regime to be promulgated. State would regulate

private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" - each member to have specific

responsibilities and feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also

asked for $10, 000 by next wednesday -- Bender made commitment.

believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-

U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.

Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being

supported, FRD, MRP and MR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem

to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of

the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is

problematical.

with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his own brother

to the fact that Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a

traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and

supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations.

Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and:

deceitrul. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic

movement.

Origin of Autonomous Operations

Parallel to regular CIA-

controlled Cuban teams, CIA woüld extend financial aid and some advice and

guidance to independent and uncontrolled

• Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1963 program.

"It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be

executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the

overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,

both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.

The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost

in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations

can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,

they cannot be resumed.

All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory

of the United States.

The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly

any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may

be the reports of US. complicity.

The United States presence and direct participation in the

operation would be kept to an absolute minimum.

Before entering into an

operational relationship with a group,

the U.S. representative will make it

clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except

to counter intervention by the Soviets.

An experienced CIA officer would be

assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity.

He would provide

general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.

He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.

According to CIA files, information atd Aug 1963 from a Cuban emigree source,

Roige was designated chief of intelligence by National Direction Aoroad of

Source said intelligence group created in Marc. 1963 on orders of

Manuel Ray for purpose of infiltrating JURE members into various organizations

which operated in Miami area,

as well as into agencies of U.S. govt.

further,

that in April 1963, Ray had issued orders to infiltrate a JURE member into CIA

in order to learn details of plans regarding Cuba. JURE also intended to

drop leaflets into Cuba of a derogatory nature regarding U.S. govt.

cluded in these leaflets was Subject's manifesto against the U.S. govt and

against this Agency.

ItI, ata June 2, 1966 from DI. Julian Gallo to Harry (Mahoney?)

Gallo is contact with Ray in Puerto Rico and trying to discover the names

of Ray's contacts in Cuba.

Ray, apparently is seeking a Mexican visa from

Gallo and unhappy that it did not come through.

Refused to reveal names

or addresses to Gallo and would not give information acout were his radio

broadcast tapes were to be sent for transmission into Cuba.

Memo for the Record, ata 21 June 1965 from Charles Anderson

Met with Ray on 28 April 1966.

Anderson said in general Ray had less

information on the

"purge situation that I did.!

Ray. said relatives

of Gustavo Arcos in P.R. had telephone contact with Arcos family in Cuba,

about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him

were thin.

"(This means there was at least one more telephone call than

re knew of previously, and this has probably served to increase the pressure

on Arcos."

Anderson tells of his concern ard strong interest in Acos on

the chance that Ray might assume Arcos had been CIA agent. Doesn't know

if Ray will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use

an important exile channel as a possible deception nechanism."

"I believe that later in the sumer it might be a good idea to have

another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exile thinking, and feeding nore

deception thoughts."

Antonio Cuesta del Valle of Commandos I, and DRE members. Also, Rolando

Masferrer Rojas on the inside of Haiti operations and has the most influence

among the Haitians.
