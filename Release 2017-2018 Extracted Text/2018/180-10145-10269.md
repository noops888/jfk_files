15. 11/17/60. 2 Director from MASH
On 11/15/60, jalies Bender met with Ray in complete privacy. .
"Unquestionably, thé youthful, softspoken, unassuming, almost humtle Ray!
is a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion."
Ray's political posture doubtful as fer as U.S. government acceptance is
concerned.

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles
unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1940
constitution, Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would be
established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed
at beginning of his regime to be promilgated. State would regulate

private investment and utilities vould be nationalized,

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -= each member to have specific
responsibilities and feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also
asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made commitment,
a

believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-
U.S. Tink end door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.
Ray egrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of ell the groups being
supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem
to be locking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of
the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained 1s
problematical.

Subject: Meeting with King and Esterline on subject of handling
MRP, 11/18/60

Consensus wes that Ray did not politically represent ampthing to cheer
about. Writer felt MRP opposed to joining FRD and recognized need to
control MRP and wean it away to the extent possible from its leaders.
Could be done by controlling financial and military support. It wes
agreed in meeting with Mr, Barnes that financial and military support
for MRP be channelled through FRD.

Note: Cover note pencilled comment (The content is so biased and mixed
with untruth that it would be a disservice to the intelligence commmnity
to disseminate it.

Synopsis of paragraphs 1-11. Dr. Salas says during his childhood Ray ves
a Protestant tut today is completely atheistic. Said Ray organized the MRC
against Batista and shortly after Batista's fall, MRC and 26th of July
Movement fused into one, and as soon as Castro came into power, control

of the organization was given to the Commmists. Tells of Ray's association
with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his om brother
Was renounced by Castro. Stated that Ray's rupture with Fidel wes due

to the fact that Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as e

traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and
Supported the Castro regime without eny mental reservations. Says in
Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and:
deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic
Procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own
movement.

Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Rey was in favor of maintaining S
relations with USSR and not making Commnist Party illegal. Said that

although Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press

coverage, Alvarez’ thinks they are representative of may's thinking and

would try to put ideas into practive if he ever came to power. Alverez

also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services,

socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.

Synopsis of paragraph 13. Dr. Beruf? said Ray well-intentioned with no
Communist tendencies. Cited 2 meeting at which the basic points of the

MRP platform were discussed and said that since Ray was in disagreement vith
the others on most of the points, Dr. Felipe Pazos acted as chairman of the
meeting and Ray argued his case as a simple member of the group. Out of this
meeting came a declaration of 14 points, including the nationalization of
the banks and public utilities,

On 9 March, Ray said that ideas attributed to him in Paragraph 12 were not

frue and part of a “campaign egainst him by Mr. Pawley of the Miami City

Signed: Calvin Hicks H/l/pm/operations

"Ray is balieved to have accomplished pratically nothing towards the effort
to overthow Castro. Instead, it seems that whenever we played with his so-
called assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or
operations, several days after some other group had already set them up or
claimed them. Whenever it came to producing and backing up his claims, he
always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has
always tended to try to take over other goups, rather than cooperate with
them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against them.
His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power
in Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo
RAY is so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous (or more
so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro, if he ever got to
ve the power in Cuba.”

Origin of autonomous Operations

Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher authority
in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups
fo supplement and assist in the execution” of other courses of action
foucept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter Rostow's proposal for a
“Track Two" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-
Sontrolled Cuban teams, CIA wold extend financial aid and some aivice and
guidance to indepentent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such ag Mecuel Ray.

2s ine effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost
in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations
gan be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,
they cannot be resumed,

3, All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory
of the United States,

4. The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly
ony Participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurete may
be the reports of Ui S, complicity,

3. The United States presence and direct participation in the
Gperation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into on
cperational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make it
clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except
to counter intervention by the Soviets. An experienced CIA officer would be
assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide
general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support,
He may be expected to influence but not control the comiuet of operations.

6. These operations would not ve undertaken within a Fixed tio
schedule."

4, Memo for the Record, dtd 11 Sept 1964 from Alfonso Rodreguez

On Aug 24, 1964, Rogelio Cisneros called to report his resignation from JURE.
Stated Ray incapable of directing both political and military activities.
Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not
Prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had
believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba, "Ray is politically
unformed --- politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated
that he believed Ray hed planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle vith President
Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. Accord:
him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding liberal and deocractic
exile group with the thought that prior to the 196k elections, Mr. Kennedy
would have to do something about Cuba, With Kennedy's death, according to
Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros
that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got
idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of JURE.

5+ Memo for the Record - draft - dtd 22 Sept 196k - alfonso Rodriguez
Conclusions "I recommend we give Ray what he asks and close the JURE books
for good. “If Ray is succesful in Cuba he will not need our help, if he is
not, our help won't do much good.

"He is honest and at least the money will largely be spent for the
purpose he wants to achief . °

“Whatever Ray may ever say, he was treated the way he asked to ve
treated, le have played the game in a manner beyond reproach."

about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him
were thin, "( This means there was at least one more telephone call than

on Arcos)." Anderson tells of his concern and strong interest in Arcos on
the chance that Ray might assume Arcos nad ceen CIA agent. Doesn't know
if Ray will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use
an important exile channel as a possible deception mechanism,”
