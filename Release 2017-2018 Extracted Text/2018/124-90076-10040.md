CONFIDENTIAL,

On May 1, 1967,

cIA (covert),

Miami, advised SA JAMES D.

HAYES that he had no additional

information concerning subject in Miami. 5+L

Bulet, December 29, 1966, requested comments,

servations, and recommendations, as to further investigation.

It is, therefore, respectfully submitted that

results of investigation in New York area, as requested

in this report, will, to a great extent, determine the future

course of investigation.

Therefore, recommendations as to

further investigation will be submitted on receipt of New

York report.

-The question to be resolved is whether or not

subject is presently a Cuban Intelligence Service (CIS)

agent.

A review of material in this report, and in reports

previously submitted, would tend to show that subject could

have functioned as such. Considering CIS targets, subject's

activities in the Miami area in 1959 and 1960, prior to the

time he went to New York, are highly suspect.. He seems to

have been able to disrupt every attempt by anti-CASTRO organi-

zations to organize or uniff. For

example,

not only did he

denounce the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD), as

well as its leader, MANUEL ANTONIO VARONA, as a tool of the

Communists, he also said he had withdrawn

support of GARCIA

KOHLY, SR., and his Cuban Liberating Commandos, after associ

ating with KOHLY in Washington, D. C.

When questioned about

individual units in the KOHLY organization,

ECHEGOYEN

he had either withdrawn his support of KOHLY, or that he,

ECHEGOYEN, could furnish no additional information concerning

each individual unit. This information was

previously submitted(u

agent (Legat, Havana, letter to Director, July 16, 1959)

of the Cuban Air Force. It is possible that the Bureau

has more information on this point concerning subject

and DIER in June, 1959, and subsequent period.

There could have been also attempts to plant

information such as the information originally furnished

in Los Angeles, California, May 9, 196T,

by subject to GEORCE TODT, Herald ExpresShadmnist,

ECHEGOYEN, had received a code message from Cuba

to the

effect that the Cuban Government imported printing

equipment from East Germany via Czechoslovakia capable of

counterfeiting $50.00 and $100.00 bills in U.S. currency.

The above has been reported previously.
