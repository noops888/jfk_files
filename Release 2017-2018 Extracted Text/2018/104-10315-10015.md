7 September 1961

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Consideration of the Cuban Matter by the 3412

Special Group

1. Attached are my detailed notes made while reading the

minutes of the Special Group yesterday. The 12 pp. paper that

paper purported to quote the minutes only with reference to the

strike force concept. (It should be replaced in the two WH/4

bound volumes of papers furnished the Taylor Committee, at

"Part FF.")

2. I call attention to the following new matters, which

suggests a number of points that should be reflected in my draft irri

report of 31 August 1961:

Al.

Parrott was the Assistant to DD/P for Executive

Branch Matters (DD/P/FBM). He not only acted as secretary of

Special Group, and briefed the DCI beforehand, but took an active

role in the discussions,

at least from time to time, i.e., at

meetings of 8/11, 9/1, 9/8 and 11/16. This introduces stil]

another non-operator echelon in the decision-making, between DCI

and Chief, WH/4.

b. These minutes show the extremely detailed reporting

by CIA to the Special Group and requests for approval of individual

operations, 1.e., individual air drops.

c. Note that the detailed reporting to the Special Grou

was almost always done by Bissell or Barnes, not by the DCI.

d. Note Adm. Burke's statement that Navy Ideas were to

have 50,000 U.S. military for intervention in Cuba. (3/14/60 meeting)

Query:

was this statement in the back of the minds of CIA operators

bathe Cuban Brigade was only a spearhead

considerable additional talk of overt intervention.

e. Note (8/25 meeting) reference to Barnes' assurances to

Macy of Budget that 1t would be "out of question" to mount an

invasion without participation of large numbers of disaffected

individuals within the country (Cuba).

I. The words "Special Discussion" eâ€¢g., 10/6 meeting,

DP/D

indicate in my notes discussions of sensitive Do/! activities (PIC).

They are described at length in the minutes, but I took no notes on

g. Note (11/3 meeting) State's suggesting that the three

top Cubans be assassinated.

h. Note CIA was conducting a re-evaluation of the entire

situation (which presumably led to the decision to go ahead with a

large brigade): Should we not ask Bissell whether any memoranda of

this re-evaluation are in existence?

1. There is reference to Cuba being on NSC agenda for early

November 1960. Should we inquire what was said at such NSC meeting?

j. Note Barnes' preposterous statement (12/5) that 600

troops (in invasion) would be just as useful as 3000.

k. It is clear that the pressures to get the Cuban trainees

out of Guatemala were considered by the Special Group to be real and

urgent.

3. Will IG and GD and RIBS please make" additsonal suggestions, for

Inclusion in draft report?
