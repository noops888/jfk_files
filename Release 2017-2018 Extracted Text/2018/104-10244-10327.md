T. 17 March 1967. A review of-files does not
confirm that CIA was involved ia this incident.

(1) Felix ASENCIO Trejo. There is a 201 file
on the iadividual wiich indicates tuat a POA was granted
on 4 sfarca 19u4 since subject was of interest to us as a
possible canlidate for paranilitary o7crations against Cuba.
The POA was cancelled on 20 Aucust 1404 with no indication
that subject was ever actually used operationally.

: (2) Wilfredo MARTINEZ Diaz. Wo have no positively
identifiable information on this individual.

. (3) Lazaro Gustavo ARECES Alvarez. There is 8
201 file on the individual which indicates that @ POA was
ranted 7 July 1964 for intended use as @ seanan aboard a
IA vessel involved in maritine operations. The POA was
cancelled 8 September 1964 with the indication rhat the
subject wat uot hired.

U. 1971. There is nothing in files roviowed to

indicate that we had any contact with the subject nentioned

dn the report or wero involved in the alloged incident.

1) Jesus DOMINGUEZ Benitez. No CIA tracos on
subject were found.

2.. It is noted that the above totals twenty-one separate
analytical sections whereas there aro actually twonty-four
alleged assassination attcnpts. This is due to the fact that
the analyses of the two incidents of 26 July 1961 have been
conbined since thoy both occurred on the sane day and wore
allegedly executed by the samo group. The trcatment of the
alloged June 1965 poisoning attempt is part of tho analysis
of the mid 1964 incident because the alloged pepotrator is
Taleté! to the group described thercin. ho incident doseribed
in Castro's report as mid 1905 has been combined with tho

analysts of the 1966 incident since both were allegedly carriod
out by the sane group.
