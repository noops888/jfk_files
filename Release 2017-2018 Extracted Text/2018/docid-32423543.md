testified that McNamara agreed memo should be withdrawn.

Harvey memo to McCone moting he called Lansdale's office and

told Frank Hand of the "stupidity"

of including in the

Lansdale memo as a topic to be considered "liquidation

of leaders."

CIA would not participate in preparation

of such documents pertaining to liquidation and urged

that Hand recommend to Lansdale that phrase be excised.

Lansdale called back to say that it had been done.

Harvey memo to DDP (CIA) notes that matter of assassi-

nation brought up in Rusk's office by McNamara.

"I took

careful note

from the comments...and the SGA is not

expecting any written comments or study on this point."

"attached papers were read and approved by higher

authority today."

Papers were Taylor guidelines for

phase two.

President told SGA favors more aggressive

program.

Sabotage

was to be employed on selective

basis under

guidelines.

Was this the first time McNamara

was

aware of the Lansdale memo?

Had he himself made an effort to

have Lansdale withdraw the memo

independent of McCone's request?

Why was Harvey so concerned?

He had carried out full-scale

operation against Castro in

April of 1962.

Was it simply

the fear of having something in

writing?

Were they expecting unwritten

comments or studies on this point?

TOP SECRET

QUESTIONS AND ISSUES

SGA requests CIA to submit list of possible sabotage

targets.

"The group by reacting to

this list could de-

fine the limits

within which the Agency could operate

on its own initiative."

Was this an abdication of

control?

At SGA meeting where Lansdale was present Bundy notes

re agricultural sabotage

that release of chemicals

must be avoided unless it could be completely covered

up.

''more direct action"

is not indicated.

AG says

President dissatisfied with lack of action in the

sabotage field.

Lansdale recommends early approval of CIA plans for

sabotaging Cuban shipping vessels.

Lansdale disavows any responsibility or support for

proposed infiltration of 9 teams into Cuba.

"Mr. Harvey's defense of the plan was not conclusive."

teams were to be withheld.

This is the Matahambre

copper mine

sabotage operation.

Was Lansdale kept in the dark

about these operations?.

Numerous

Harvey memos have marked as a

footnote on them re Matahambre

"not in Lansdale's memo."

What

does this mean?

McCone tells Lansdale President has decided to hold

back Operation Mongoose during negotiations on

Soviet missile crisis. No more sabotage of any

form.

Harvey memo says that Lansdale's statement that

Operation Mongoose "had had no information on this

opeation (Matahambre) since early October was patently

false."

This was part of an escalating

debate over how much Lansdale

either knew or did not know about

that operation. Was Harvey cover-

ing his tracks?

TOP SECRET

QUESTIONS AND

Lansdale tells Rockefeller Commission he tried to stop

sabotage.

however, that there were discussions

in the SGA concerning the possibility of plans to assassi-

nate foreign leaders.

He denies,

however, that any such

plans were ever actually formuated.

Washington Post story says Lansdale "Hinted strongly,

but refused

to confirm,

that the orders to draw up

plans (that may have included Fidel Castro's assassina-

tion)

came from the late Attorney General Robert F.

Kennedy." Lansdale insisted however, that "neither

President Kennedy or any other Kennedy ever gave me

any orders to plan the assassination of Castro."

In a New York Times story Horrock reports that "yesterday

General Lansdale said that in November, 1961, AG Robert

F. Kennedy ordered him to prepare a secret contingency

plan to depose Mr. Castro.

General Lansdale confirmed

that Robert Kennedy was acting on behalf of President

Kennedy."

Assassination may have been considered as one

of the mans of removing Castro.

He never redeived specific

orders from JFK or RFK to prepare a plan to assassinate

Castro.

Washington Star story by O'Leary reports that Lansdale

"has named Robert F. Kennedy as the Administration

official who ordered him in 1962 to launch a CIA project

to work out all feasible plans for 'getting rid of'

Prime Minister Fidel Castro."

The word assassination was

never used by anyone Lansdale said, but there was no doubt

that

the

plans

envisioned this as one of the means. Lansdale

relayed the orders directly to William Harvey.

Lansdale gives statement to Select Committee stating that

Washington Star story is a distortion of his remarks.

"I can say that I never did receive any order from President

Kennedy or from the Attorney Genral...no order about taking

action against Castro personally."

operation directed against Cuba.

EDWARDS told PAPICH that the CIA would object to the

use of CIA personnel or information in prosecutions,

and

that the introduction of evidence concerning the

CIA operation would be "embarrassing to the Government."

On March 23, HOOVER sent a letter to MCCONE through

EDWARDS characterizing the ROWAN wiretap as involving

"intelligence information"

forwarded the letter to HOUSTON,

requesting him to in-

form Assistant Attorney General MILLER that the ROWAN

wiretap was related to intelligence operations against

Cuba.

On April 16, HOUSTON requested MILLER to under-

take no prosecutions for the ROWAN wiretap.

HOUSTON

then briefed DDCI CARTER, who said that MCCONE might

be briefed in "due time"

There is no indication

that CARTER was told about the assassination opera-

tion or that MCCONE was briefed by any of the parties.

Early April, 1962

HARVEY requested EDWARDS to put him in touch with ROSELLI.

In early April, O'CONNELL introduced HARVEY to ROSELLI in

HARVEY told ROSELLI to maintain his Cuban contacts,

but not to deal with MAHEU or GIANCANA.

GRAY tells Special Group that any covert action

like sugar mill sabotage should be undertaken only

after overall consideration of "whether and how

the U.S. wishes to move against CASTRO." (SG Minutes)

"GRAY asked the /Special/ Group's views on

what happens after TRUJILLO, specifically how

CASTRO can be kept out of the Dominican Republic."

Acting DCI CABELL recommends U.S. military inter-

vention after TRUJILLO departe. (SG Minutes)

GRAY said "the opinion had been expressed to

him" that DILION should be. "Chief of Staff" for

all Cuba activities. (SG Minutes)

GRAY says "the U.S. has taken publicly about

all that it

can afford to take from the Castro

goverrment." (SG Minutes)

Memo from the Chief of CIA's Western Hemisphere

Division to the Acting DCI recommending delivery

of high-powered rifles with telescopic scopes to

the opponents of TRUJILLO.

The memo said: "approval

for delivery of these arms has been given by ASSISTANT

GRAY said "his associates" would favor the

development of sabotage operations in CUBA.

BISSELL outlines 13.3 million dollar budget for

Cuban operations which was to be laid before

"higher authorities" for decision. (SG Minutes)

Issues and Questions

Did such consideration involve assassination

plotting?

Did US support TRUJILLO's opponents out ofa

desire to keep CASTRO out of the Dominican

Republic?

General atmosphere of vehement opposition to

CASTRO.

Was the Special Group aware of this action?

Was the President aware of the plan?

Purpose of weapons?

(SG Minutes; emphasis added)

GRAY, DOUGLAS, and MERCHANT take the view that

events in Cuba,

"have now progressed to a point

where covert activities of the type originally

envisaged for CIA to undertake will not be

effective.

GRAY suggested "using the CIA-

overt intervention."
