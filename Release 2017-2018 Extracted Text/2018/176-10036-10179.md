Current Overall Evaluation

The general trend appears slightly favorable, with the GVN continuing

to improve its military, and to a limited extent, its political and econ

nid position.

Basic problems are being eroded but quick and decisive

action is rare. There were no major breakthroughs or important victories.

and nore appear likely in the Immsdiate future.

The Viet Cong show no

weakening in strength or deterination despite reportedly heavy losses.

On the military side, Operations Binh Minh and Hai Yen continued

well. Viet Cong casualties were up and their activities down (there ie

an unconfired news report that a major battle took place July 3, however,

in which the VC defeated a regular army battalion?

This may be due to

roorganization and weather rather than GVN successes.

The GN took several

good but minor steps to increase popular support for the war effort, and

several rural ticial and econanie programs moved ahead aignificantly. On

the international front, there were some favorable responses to our efforts

to set up an aid coordinating group of donor nations.

Economic conditions

Improved sonest, with stable prices, credit a little less tight, consu-

mer goods sales and tax collections up, and rice deliveries continued good.

Fearing that the prospective laa settlement will facilitate Viet Cong

activities and that it may presage a U. S. move to neutralize Viet-Nam it-

self, the GVN has made difficulties at Geneva over several issues and

threatens to boycott the conference.

President Kernedy has sent Diem a

personal letter stressing the importance we attach to a laos settlement

and our determination to continue to help Viet-Nam defend Itself. There

is no response as yet.

Progress on Action Program

I. VC Activity

Viet Cong activity continued at a relatively low level, with arined

attacks falling to the lowest point over a year, 60, for the perdod 20-21

he and rising ony stightly to 75 for the period June 27 • July 4.

The

lack of VC aggressiveness is likely due to the reiny season and their

efforts to regroup in order to counter the Improved mobility and partora

mance of the GN forces.

Observing that this appears to be a period of

VC reorganization and assimilation of recent infiltrators, COMUSMACV 29-

ports indications that VC units which previously operated as separate

platoons and companies are nos being forned Into battaliond. Infiltration

evidently continues, but good intelligence is scarce. MCV Jo2 estinates

intiltration in May at 800-1, 000 and 800 for the first three weeks of jure,

but this Information is unconfirmed and there are no reports of Infilt

tion since.

In spite of reduced VC activity, VC casualties were high and included

some main force personnel. For the perled 20-27 June the VC suffered a

reported increace of casuslties of almost 25 per cent over the previous

reporting perlod. Killed in action for the two week period were 865 vC

and 14l friendly forces.

Reports continue to indieste a critical VC chortage of medical supplies.

Unconfirmed reports rsise the possibility thet the VC are attaining an anti-

sircraft capability.

(Following itens are keyed to the Viet-Nan draft action program of

Jaly 3)

Strengthen popular support. The OVN took several steps to generate

more popular support in the last two weeks. These include the July I release

of 794 prisoners in connection with the celebration of the "double seven"

holiday (anniversary of Dien's coning to power), a stepped-up drive to root

out los-level corruption and abuse of power by VY officials, end a Presiden-

tially proposed amendment to the Constitution permitting the questioning of

Cabinet Ministers both by Cormittees of the National Assembly and by the

National Assembly in plenary session. The prisoners released may include

leading oppositionist Phan Quang Dan, who has been in prison since his par-

ticipation in the attempted 1960 coup, We have urgad the last item on Dier

ia the past in an effort to increase the povers and prestige of the National

Assembly.

Another favorable development is increased emphasis on working with and

for the people in the current training progran for strategic hanlet cadres.

Ngo dinh Nhu (President's brother in charge of the strategic hanet program)

is concerned that the program win genuine popular support.

He favors the

election of hamlet officials by secret ballot inatead of by custonary shou

'of banis. This is now being done in sons hamlets.

4. Seek International Support

(=) Cambodian Relations. The GVN replied mildly to the Cambodian

the ARWN border Incursions of June l6, but did not apologize

or offer indemnities. The note insists that all precautions sere taken to

avoid crossing the poorly marked frontier, sinits that in spite of these pre-

cautions the frontier may have been violated. points out that any such inad-

vertent crossing was not notivated by hostility tovarú Cambodia, denies the

arrest of or harm to Canbodian inhabitants, and proposes a mixed border cor

tral comittee to study frontier incidents and provide for future border

coperation.

Another source of GVi-RKG friction, disputed coastal islands:

was the subject of an exchange of notes which threatened to stir up further

tromble between Cambolia and Yiet-Nam.

(b) Third Country Ald.

The United States has suggested a

Saigon, and possibly a later Washington meeting of donor country repre-

sentatives to coordinate aid to Viet-Nam.

• The intention is to stimlate

more third country ald 11 possible, and to make sure that current third

country contributions are being effectively applied. To date, Australla

and New Zealand have indicated sillingness to participate in such meetings,

Germany will take part in informal Saigon meetings but would not attend

any fornal washington gathering, and the Japanese are "proceeding with

caution" because of the expressed fear that too close identification

with the U.S. will open up Japanese technicians in Viet-Nam to Viet Cong

reprisals. Canada has declined to participate because of its membership

on the ICC. The Belgians. French, Italians and the UK have not yet

responded.

Negotiations for the integration of Australian trainers into

our MAAG appear near completion.

The GVN has indicated Its willingness to

receive a New Zealand medical team at any time and the details are being

worked out with wellington and Saigon.

10. Military Civic Action

The 31st Engineer Battalion assisted the local population at

Cheo Reo in Pleiku Province in the construction of a Buddhist temple.

In addition to the 150, 000 copies of a news sheet distributed weekly by

soldiers to the local civilian population, 35,000 copies of the sheet

were also air dropped.

12. Develop and Implement Mutually Agreed Plans

Operations Binh Minh and Hal Yen. Saigon reports both clear-

and-hold operations continuing to make progress without serious VC reaction.

Increased contact with the VC is reported in the Hal Yen area, however, as

the military move into VC territory.

Fanlet Councils have been elected in the Hai Ten area, but the

Embassy notes a serious problem in the fact that a hamlet Council member

receives only 300 piasters (about $4.00) per month for what is theoreti-

cally a full time job.

In Operation Binh Minh, an effort will be made to

induce the people to move voluntarily into the fourth village to be set

up there.

The plan calls for extensive propaganda and explanations in

advance of the move. establishment of military control over the area so

that the people will be free to move voluntarily, and up to 15 days to

accomplish the move itself (previous regrouping actions allowed only a

very short period for the physical move).

Montagnards.

Latest information developed as a result of joint

surreys indicates the Montagnard situstion is more a long term problem

than an emergency. There has in fact been a movement of some 17,000 Hon-

tagnard as a reaction to VC pressures, and this movement will probably

continue, particularly if the GWN provides adequate food and security.

Alnost all Montagnard refugees are at least temporarily resettled and re-

ceiving minimum food, shelter and

security.

The Embassy conments that while this information somenhat reduces

the urgency of the problem, it does not change the problen's magnitude or

importance. Difficulties stening from the absence of a well directed,

national Montagnard relief progran, linited relief resources, and the Viet-

namese prejudice against the Montagnard continue. But the principal and

most encouraging aspact is the fact that the Montagnard have fled the VC

pressures and more may do so.

Strategic Hamlet Program. The second ten day training course for

490 strategie hamlet cadres was Inaugurated by Ngo dinh Nhu in Saigon July 2.

Future Plans. According to CAS, L

15. Provide Increased Technical Assistance.

Village Radios. As of July 4, 817 of the planned 2500 village.

radios were installed and operating. Tests of radios for use on trains

were started.

Defoliation. The Enbassy has proposed a test of the effectiveness

of defoliants against VC food patches in the mountainous area of Operation

Hai Yen.

Governor Harriman opposes the use of defoliants on food crops be-

cause of the effect on Asian opinion.: Decision and action will be delayed

until the Governor's return from Geneva.

20. Integrate Economic Measures with Counterinaurgency Bffort.

One hundred farmers will study farming and stock raising nethods for one

month, including the use of fertilizers and pesticides.

Anti-Rat Program. The USOM-supported rat destruction campaign was

carried out in ten northern provinces June 12-22, resulting in the destruction

of an estimated 15-20 million rats or 20,000 per village.

25. Publicize the War Within Viet-Nem and Internationally:

Viet-Nam Photo Service.

USIS Saigon is sending out a weekly packet

of photos designed to enlist third country interest and support for the eVN

var effort. Eight posts have reported favorably on the effort, indicating

no difficulty in placing the photos in leading newspspers.

28. Establish Network of USIS Sub-posts.

The GVN has agreed to the establishment of virtually any nunder

of USIS sub-posts throughout the country. Negotiations on locations and

physical arrangements are underway.

THAILAND

Current Situation Evalustion

The RIG has accepted the International Court decision awarding the

disputed Phra Viner temple to cambodie.

Thai delegates attended the

Geneva Conference on Laos, which reconvened on July 2: but the RG has

not yet announced its intention to attend the next meeting of the SEATO

Council of Representatives in mid-July..

On July? the US began the redeployment of 1, 000 Merines from the

Third Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Udorn. Possible Thai concern over

this nove was lessened by our informing them at the same time of a us

financed progran to improve logistic facilities in Thailand (see belor).

Ors June 29 police arrested one suspected Communist in Chiengral and

one in lempang, both in the North of Thailand. The That press reports

that subversive documents were confiscated at both locations. According

LAOS

Current Situation Evaluätion

The principal renaining issues before the Geneva Conference, Including

SEATO, having been resolved. It is anticipated that the new Accords may be

signed nert week.

There is nevertheless one serious stumbling block, which

endangers the satisisctory conclusion of the Conference, 1.e., the possible

refusal of the GVN to sign. The (VN's position stems from its belief that

so many concessions have been made to the Commnists that the security of

SVN 13 gravely threatened. We are, however, hopeful that Diem will still

be persuaded that we have achieved the best obtainable compromise for los

and that we stand firm on our comitments to suN.

Progress on Action Program

There has been little progress on our action progran. We are con

centrating at present on the following problems:

1. Economic Assistance. Elaboration of our future aid to Laos awaits

the visit of Souvanns Phouns to Washington, tentatively scheduled for

July 25-27. In the meantime, we seek to spread the burden of providing

Souvanna with the material assistence he requires by enlisting contribu

tions from other Free World nations.

2. RLO Diplomatic Relations.

The RIG's decision to recognize 5 bloc

countries and accept an exchange of Ambassadors poses a major problem with

respect to the OVN. GRC, Federal Republic of Germany and the ROK, Further

action by the RIG is deferred until Souvanna's return to laos. In the in-

terim we are attempting to assist the pro-lestern countries involved in

establishing or maintaining satisfactory representation in Laos.

3. Icc.

We have asked our Geneva delegation to request the Icc to

prepare a detailed budget and list of equipment needs so that we will be

prepared to meet quickly our share of the requirements.

With regard to

the essential heavy equipment - helicopters and light aircraft - we are

taking steps to make it immediataly avatlable to the ICC.

4. MAC Withdrawal. With the signing of the Accords, we will asel

Canadian cooperation in utilizing to the full the 75-day period for the

withdraval of foreign military personnel. Inis mud give us the mim

possible opportunity to determine wether the bit de abiding by 1t8

calmdtments and whether the Soviets as Co-Chairnan are carrying out

their undertaking.

BURMA

Current Situation Evaluation

The internal situation remains unstable. This fact was highlighted

by incidents on July 7 and 8 when student denonstrations led by pro-

Cormunist organizations sere ruthlessly repressed by the police and army.

These Incidents could sell lead to increased public disaffection with the

Ne win regime and to a rift betwen the regime and the opportunistic

leftiet groups who have, heretofore, been its only outspoken civilian

political supporters.

Internal security conditions are apparently contiming to deteriorste,

though not dramatically. A special Government amnesty offer expired June 30

without producing significant response from the insurgents.

Progress on Action Program

1. Political

It has been confirmed that Brigadier Min Pe of the Union Revolationary

Ceancil will come to Washington for medical treatment as planned probably

in late July, although precise dates have not been deternined.

2. Economic (AID)

No new developments.

3. Malitary

a. The burnose are ready formally to accept the FY 1962 military

"sales" program.

State and DOD have agreed to accelerate deliveries of Ma

carbines as requested by the Burnese, to the extent production facilities

permit, in order to contribute to planned post-monsoon counter-inaurgency

This action will also, hopefully, earn sone political credit

b. Embassy Rangoon has confined that United States training

for Burnese officers will be continued under the FY 1962 program.

117

prospective students have been proceased for the coming year.

CAMBODIA

Current Situation Evaluation

Cambodia's differences with neighboring Thailand and South Viet-Nam

continue, but they have so far not significantly affected the presently

generally satisfactory relations between the United States and Cambodia.

Thai moves concerning Preah Vihear temple are being watched closely, and

it appears likely that If the announced decision to respect the World

Court's award is not implemented by September the matter may be brought

by Cambodia to the attention of the UNGA.. The dispute between Cambodia

and Viet-Nam over the ownership of islands off the Cambodian shore has come

to the fore again, with the GWN rejecting a Cambodian protest against Vietna-

mese naval movements near them on the grounds that they belong to VietNam.

Organization of a new Cabinet has been postponed pending religious rites

celebrating the World Court decision.. New evidence of ant1-Sihanouk plotting

in Bangkok has developed.

Progress on Action Program

1. RKG-GVN Border Commission (Pol. 8). The GVN reply to the RKG's pro-

test against. the June I6 border Volations 1s not entirely satisfactory, but

Phnon Penh believes it may allow progress on the border commission proposal

and has raised this possibility with the foreign Hinistry.

2o Force Increase (M1l. l). The initial reaction of the RKG to approval

of the request for a force increase of 3,284, for MAP support only, 1a one of

disappointment that military budget support was not included.

New Aircraft (M11. 5). Four To28 aircraft, fret increment of sire

Ambassador Sprouse.
