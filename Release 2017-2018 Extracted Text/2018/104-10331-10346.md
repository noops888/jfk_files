have discussed, the extension will have a

budgetary impact.

We will need to fund the JFK project for

FY 98 and FY 99.

There will be substantial work to be done

in preparing documents for National Archives after the

Board's mandate has expired.

The completion of the entire

project in FY 98 would require significant increase in

resources including indexing and ADP support.

The following suggested response to OMB's request for

via E-mail to

me vear extension of the JFK Board was sent

OCA (I CCayou and Brian) :

"The Agency is committed to continuing to cooperate.

with the Assassination Records Review Board as long as it

exists.

We agree that there is considerable work to done

beyond the current expiration date of 30 September 1997.

Attached are the OMB request and Tilley's and Tunheim's

prepared testimonies.

and I had a problem with Tunheim's statement on page 11 (se€

clip) re "assurances from the FBI and CIA"

•it and coment

Carol Keeley

We bothrtalked

with Marwell and he has

agreed to drop the ward "explicit"

and to change "the" to "our" task. I told him it was

important that the impression not be left that the entire

project would be completed by the end of FY98. I remained

him that we had had several

discussions of postponing

processing documents (especially duplicates and material of

marginal interest), for NARA so that we can focus on the

more important documents and substantive issues.

As we have discussed, the extension will have

budgetary impact.

We will need to fund the JFK project for

FY 98 and FY 99.

There will be substantial work to be done

in preparing documents for National Archives after the

Board's mandate has expired.

The completion of the entire

project in FY 98 would require significant increase in

resources including indexing and ADP support.
