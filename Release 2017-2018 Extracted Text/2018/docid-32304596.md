arrested and was a prisoner in La Cabana. He is supposed

to have escaped somehow to Miami and later came to Tampa,
where he distributed "Bohemia Libre," for an income of
$10.00 per week. Also he and his wife work for a cleaning
service at nights, cleaning offices. He is not known to mve
taken any part in activities pro- or anti-CASTRO. CRUZ
stated that he had been told by a Dr. PEREZ NUNEZ, who works
in the County Hospital, Tampa, that MATOS was known to him
as a communist, and he suspects that BECQUER is also a
communist since he was MATOS' right-hand man. NUNEZ was
formerly an army doctor in Cuba with rank of lieutenant

and was stationed in Camaguey, where he knew Major HUBERT
MATOS very well. BECQUER is described as 30 years of age,
very short, 130 lbs., dark skin.

this time. He is a former aide to. Major HUMBERTO MATOS and
is one of 14 individuals who escaped from the Isle of Pines,
where they were incarcerated. He states he is anti-communist
and anti-CASTRO, but nothing else is known of his, background.
