LORENZO JOSEPH

MANFREDI

MANFREDI is associated and mentioned primarily

in the case captioned, "MICHAEL ANTHONY RIZZI, aka, AR,

Bufile

92-6107."

MANFREDI was contacted on 3/6 and 3/12/63, at

He expressed fear for his life due tó rumors that he was a

"fink" for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) that have

been widely circulated, believed by him to have been started

by HOlLyWood Division, LAPD detectives. He denied to agents

having been a

"fink" for any law enforcement agency but,

nevertheless, 1s in fear because he has reason to believe that

MICHAEL RIZZI, also

confined at the Los Angeles County Jail,

believes the

rumors to be true.

On the first contact, MANFREDI agreed to furnish

information of value concerning the Italian elements of

organized crime if he could be moved from the jail and out

of the reach of RIZZI.. Inquiry was made to have MANFREDI

transferred, but since he had already been sentenced on one

charge, the

jail authorities did not believe it was feasible

since he was awaiting sentencing on another burglary charge.

MANFREDI has admitted being a booster and pimp,

and claims to know. RAYMOND PATRIARCA very well and formerly

lived in the same block in Providence, Rhode Island.

MANFREDI agreed to furnish information when appropriate

arrangements can be made that would be safe to contact him

without prison authorities being aware of the purpose. He

expressed a désire to go to a different prison than that which

RIZZI is sent.

Further attempts will be made to resolve these

difficulties.

A PCI case has been opened by the Los Angeles

office on MANFREDI.
