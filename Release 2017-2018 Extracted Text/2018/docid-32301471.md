MANFREDI is associated and mentioned primarily
in the case captioned, "MICHAEL ANTHONY RIZZI, aka, AR,
Bufile 92-6107," :

MANFREDI was contacted on 3/6 and 3/12/63, at
the Los Angeles County Jail resulting from a burglary conviction.
He expressed fear for his life due to rumors that he was a
"fink" for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) that have
been widely circulated, believed by him to have been started
by Hollywood Division, LAPD detectives. He denied to agents
having been a "fink" for any law enforcement agency but,
nevertheless, is in fear because he has reason to believe that
MICHAEL RIZZI, also confined at the Los Angeles County Jail,
believes the rumors to be true.

On the first contact, MANFREDI agreed to furnish
information of value concerning the Italian elements of
organized crime if he could be moved from the jail and out
of the reach of RIZZI. Inquiry was made to have MANFREDI
transferred, but since he had already beer’ sentenced on.one
charge, the jail authorities did not believe it was feasible
since he was awaiting sentencing on another burglary charge.

MANFREDI has admitted being a booster and pimp,
and claims to know. RAYMOND PATRIARCA very well and formerly
lived in the same block in Providence, Rhode Island,

MANFREDI agreed to furnish information when appropriate
arrangements can be made that would be safe to contact him
without prison authorities being aware of the purpose. He
expressed a desire to go to a different prison than that which
RIZZI is sent.

Further attempts will be made to resolve these
‘difficulties. A PCI case has been opened by the Los Angeles
Office on MANFREDI.
