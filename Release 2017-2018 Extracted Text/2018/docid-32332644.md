It was noted by the women that there have been
no unusual visitors at the aforementioned residence and
no large congregations of people at any time.

Mrs. LA ROCCA does not leave the house for any
extended period of time and her metallic blue 1963 Olds-
mobile is usually driven by her husband, who prefers it
to the Cadillac belonging to him.

II. Other Matters Relating to Personal
History and thé Current Welfare of LA ROCCA
And his Relatives sane

On November 17, 1963, ROBERT JAMES FESSLER was
interviewed at his residence by SA ROBERT A. VOEGE. He
advised that his daughter still plans to go through with
the divorce she filed against the adopted son of SEBASTIAN
JOHN LA ROCCA,.and that she has moved back.into the FESSLER
residence at RD. #2, Baden, Pa. He stated that by the same
token, LA ROCCA has moved back into his father's home at
Ingomar, Pa., and is still attending the Point park Junior
College in Pittsburgh where he its pursuing a course in
Business Administration.

: FESSLER advised that his daughter is not seek-
ing anything. unusual, as far as financial remuneration is
concerned, in this ‘divorce proceeding, but will be simply
content to secure the divorce and a monthly sum for the care
of her child. He said that she is not bitter in any way,
put that she has suffered from extreme mental cruelty. He
added that the couple has been incompatible for some period
of, time and that he. believes that divorce is probably the
best for all concerned. He added that he respects the
wishes of his daughter in this regard.

FPESSLER advised that the home purchased and fur-
nished by SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA for the couple in the
North Hills section of Pittsburgh, which. is located on
Guenevere Drive, has been sold by LA ROCCA, and that this
sale ostensibly included some of the furniture and fixtures
in the home in addition to the carpeting and drapes. He
understands that the adopted son of LA ROCCA is -endeavoring
to transfer his junior college credits to a bona fide four
year educational institution, and has applied at such places
as the University of Miami, Duquesne University, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, and California State Teachers College
in California, Pa. He has no idea what he wants to do in
the future, but is being constantly badgered by his father
who wants him to obtain a college degree. FESSLER person-
ally helieves that the boy is not intelligent enough to.
satisfactorily pass his grades in this regard.

FESSLER further ‘advised that his daughter is
presently unemployed, but is seeking some king of employ-
ment in the reception field so that she may be able to :
further support her young son and the elder FESSLERS with
whom she plans to live.

He has gained the impression that she has been
completely brainwashed by the LA ROCCA family and that she
no longer has any respect for law enforcement authorities
and the FBI in particular. He does not believe she would
furnish any information whatsoever concerning her relation-
ship with the adopted son of LA ROCCA or with any of the
members of the LA ROCCA family. He pointed out that she
has been extremely evasive in answering questions that he
has asked her and he believes an’ interview by the FBI would
have a similar effect. He added that the elder LA ROCCA
has given his blessing to the divorce and feels that it is
probably better for all concerned. fi

He understands that LA ROCCA has advised his
adopted son to remarry as soon as he locates another girl
who is to his liking and that he will finance any obliga-
tions brought about by his son's involvement with other
women .

PG T-6 has advised that FREDERL! au
nad definitely concluded that he Was through operating
gambling casinos*‘after his Jockey Club at Chester, W. Va.,
was closed by Special Agents of the FBI during February,.-.
1963. TEEMER believed that he had enough money to carry
him through the remainder of his life. Through some
unexplained pressure, however, which this informant
attributes to "The Italian Syndicate," TEEMER was forced
to reopen a gambling casino known as the "Red Dog." The
informant advised that in this new operation, everything
is being done by TEEMER to comply with instructions issued
by the United States District Court, which arose out of the
trial of TEEMER and others in connection with the Jockey
Club. »He noted that each employee working at the "Red
Dog" has been forced to move physically to Chester, W. Va., fe
and that the establishment has its bank account at Chester.

He said TEEMER has insisted that all employees of the
Club go home for family visits only on their days off.
