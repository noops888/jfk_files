RE: JOHN ROSELLI, aka.
AR

On 4/20 and 24/64 SHARON SHERMAN, Switchboard
Operator at the Glen Towers, where ROSSELLI resides, advised |
that she did not see ROSSELLI around the apartment during the
period from 4/10-15/64, but that she saw him on either the
16th or 17th leaving the apartment garage with a red-haired
girl. She further stated that on 4/10/64 JOE BREEN, of
Las Vegas, called for ROSSELLI, who was not in, and during
the period from 4/10-15/64 a man named IRVING LINK called
about three times for ROSSELLI.

JOSEPH I, BREEN, JR. is, by his own admission,
one of ROSSELLI's closest friends. He was formerly a
director and producer of motion pictures but is now employed
in a bank in Las Vegas, Nevada.

According to LA 4268-C, IRVING LINK frequents the
Friars Club in Beverly Hills, California, and reportedly is

engaged in real estate activities.

He is friendly with

ROSSELLI and frequently plays cards with ROSSELLI. He is
also friendly with MAURICE H, FRIEDMAN, part owner of the
Hotel Last Frontier Corporation in Las Vegas, and with JACK
BARENFELD, a clothing manufacturer in Los Angeles, and also

a part owner of the Hotel Last Frontier Corporation. FRIEDMAN
and BARENFELD are friends of ROSSELLI.

On 4/24/64 SHARON SHERMAN advised that she had
not seen ROSSELLI at the apartment during the current week
and has taken no calls for him. She said that normally if
calls come in for: ROSSELLI arid he does not answer, the calls
are referred to the switchboard of ER apartment building.

On 4/23/64 BETSY DUNCAN, PCI, who is currently
appearing as a singer-entertainer at Dino's, a night club
i on the Sunset Strip, advised that since she has been at
Hl Dino's for the past nine weeks, ROSSELLI has been there about
4 three times. The last occasion was on Friday, 4/17/64, when
4 ROSSELLI came there for dinner with a red-haired girl friend.
4 ROSSELLI introduced the girl to DUNCAN as "KATHY" and gave |
| no last name. DUNCAN said she does not know the girl and does |
i not know her last name.

i DUNCAN further advised that ROSSELLI has recently

\ been going with a woman named DOROTHY TOWNE, a former wife of
JACK WEBB, the TV and motion picture actor. It was DUNCAN's |
understanding that TOWNE, who is an interior decorator, was
the person who decorated ROSSELLI's new apartment.

DUNCAN mentioned to ROSSELLI that she would finish
her engagement at Dino's in about three weeks. ROSSELLI
suggested that she get in touch with BOB ABRAMS or BERNIE RICH }
as they could probably get her an engagement at some hotel in §
Las Vegas. She said ABRAMS ad RICH operate a talent agency
and formerly handled EDDIE FISHER, well-known singer. DUNCAN
said she told ROSSELLI that she did not need their help to get
work in Las Vegas. She did not know if ROSSELLI has any interest ]
in the talent agency of ABRAMS and RICH, This talent agency is
no doubt Selena Enterprises, Inc., mentionedpeviously in this
investigation, for whom ROSSELLI obtained free office space for
several weeks at 8490 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California.

On 4/22/64 LA 4448-C-TE advised that in the 1920's,
when ROSSELLI first came to Los Angeles, he engaged in bootlegging
and also in hi-jacking Peake trucks of JACK I. DRAGNA, who
prior to his death in 1956 was reliably reported to head the
criminal syndicate in the Los Angeles area. Informant stated
that ROSSELLI's closest friend during the 1920's was one
JOHNNY BURNS, who was associated with ROSSELLI in bootlegging
and hi-jacking operations. He said subsequently ROSSELLI and
DRAGNA patched up their differences and became close associates,
Informant further advised that BURNS currently lives in the
Los Angeles area and is about seventy-five years of age.
Efforts will be made to locate BURNS so he may be interviewed.
