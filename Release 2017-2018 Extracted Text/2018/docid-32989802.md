SUBJECT: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

ReBuairtel to Albany and other offices, 3/4/68.

(1) SA EDWARD U. CRIM has been designated by the

Atlanta Office as coordinating agent for this program.

(2)

Tbe Atlanta Division has two main black national-

ist movements. They are:

SNCC, with appoximately 15 active

members and possibly 25-35 partially active members; and No1,.

which maintains a Mosque in Atlanta having membership of about

75 to 125, with as many as 160 to 190 people appearing for some

of the open meetings.

It is estimated that, Atlanta SNCC office has very

great potential, and that NOI has very little potential, for

violence, based on information available to Atlanta at this

time.

The following subjects of the Agitator Inder are

considered militant black nationalists and night, in the

future, ba considered targets for counterintelligence action

because of their propensity for violence:

H. RAP BROWN (background not being set out

inasmuch as it is felt BROWN is widély known

(3) SNCC is considered of such potential danger

as to warrant consideration for current counterintelligence

action. This is based on information received concerning

SNCC's purposes, which have been flatly stated as "to create

chaos within the United States so that the white population.

can be brought to its knees."

(4) Atlanta is submitting no overall suggestions

As the Bureau will note in the above list, in a

number of volumes of the KING file, there are many serials

listed that cannot be accounted for. For the information

of the Bureau, back in 1977, Atlanta had a massive project

of retrieving communications containing electronic surveillance

(elsur) information regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., and

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) per a

court order in the case captioned, "BERNARD S. LEE V.

CLARENCE M. KELLEY: ET AL (U.S.D.C., D.C.) CIVIL ACTION

NO: 76-1185 AND SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

(SCLC) V. CLARENCE M. KELLEY; ET AL (U.S.D.C., D.C.) ,

CIVIL ACTION NO. 76-1186". In this project, Atlanta had to

review hundreds of volumes of Atlanta files

and retrieve

thousands of communications containing this elsur information

so these communications could be sent to FBIHQ, for eventual

-8-

## Page 59

AT 66-2242

transfer to the National Archives per the court order.

Atlanta in carrying out this project, had to use a large

number of Atlanta personnel, many being unfamiliar with

security type work and communications.

These people had been instructed to list each serial

removed from the file on a form that Atlanta devised for each

volume reviewed in project, however, it was felt that in many

instances where a cover airtel and LHM were removed from the

files, both these items would be stapled together, resulting

in only the cover airtel serial number being listed on the

form; the LHM serial number would not be noted by the person

removing this communication and as a result it was not recorded.

Atlanta feels this accounts for the bulk of the unaccounted

for serials.

Enclosed for the Bureau is one xerox copy

each of 14 documents, plus one envelope of latent

prints, which were taken from the Atlanta MURKIN file.,

as requested by FBIHQ in referenced teletype.

Referenced teletype indicated that the HSCA

had requested that the FBI furnish "all original

transparent latent lifts of value and of no value in

the possession of FBIHQ or field offices which were

collected during the course of the MURKIN investigation".

FBIHQ has pulled photographs of all latents of value

submitted by field offices from the FBIHQ MURKIN file.

The Bureau requested Atlanta to review its

MURKIN file for any latent fingerprint lifts obtained

during the course of the MURKIN Investigation and 1f

feasible, submit photographs of those lifts.

the actual lifts were to be submitted to FBiHO, which

would be returned to Atlanta alter copying by fblho.

Atlanta reviewed the lA Section of Atlanta's MURKIN

file (44-2386) as well as the bulkyexhibit sheets and

noted there were 124 lA exhibits and five bulky

exhibit sheets.

Only four lA envelopes and one

exhibit pertained to latent fingerprints obtained during

the course of the Atlanta MURKIN investigation and all of

these were previously sent to FBIHQ In 1968. Only

one of these Atlanta lA exhibit envelores currently

contained latent fingerprint lifts.

ON ASSASSINATIONS

(HSCA)

Special Agent (SA) Richard D. Rackleff,

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Atlanta

Division, was contacted telephonically on Friday,

March 17, 1978 by Robert Walker who identified

himself as a Staff Investigator for the House Select

Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) •

Walker made

arrangements to meet with SA Rackleff at the

intersection of North Avenue and Spring Street, Atlanta,

Georgia, at 11:00 AM on Monday; March 20, 1978.

Walker stated he would be in the company

second

Staff Investigator whom

he identified as Mr. Reeves,

a black male.

At 11:00 AM on March 20, 1978, SA Rackleff

net with Robert Walker and Floyd Reeves, both of

whom displayed credentials identifying themselves

to be members of the Investigative Staff of the U. S.

Congress.

Reeves conducted the questioning and requested

the information relating to the neighborhood canvassing

conducted by SA Rackleff in the vicinity of North

Highland Street and Ponce de Leon Avenue in April,

1968.

Reeves inquired as to the person or persons

coordinating the investigation conducted in the Atlanta

Division and specifically asked whether other areas

of Atlanta were canvassed in addition to this one

particular area. Reeves specifically asked if other

areas which were identified by markings on a mar

recovered from the apartment of James Earl Ray were

canvassed in addition to this one area near North

Highland Avenue and Ponce de Leon.

SA Rackleff explained he could not recall

specifically how many markings were on the map, but

believed there were basically four areas marked.

He stated three of these markings were identifiable

as being significant to the approximate location

of the home and church of Doctor Martin Luther King,

JI. and the apartment of James Earl Ray.

The fourth

marking on the map as recalled by SA Rackleff was

not significant or identifiable with any known activity

of either James Earl Ray or DI. King, and therefore

an extremely thorough, door-to-door

survey was conducted

in an area well beyond the boundaries of the fourth

marking on the map. Each and every adult member

of each household

was contacted and interviewed concerning

any knowledge or association with James bart Ray

or Dr. Martin Luther King. Photographs of Ray were

displayed and as best as could be recalled, there

was no pertinent information developed specifically

identifying any associates of either James Earl Ray

'or Dr. King.

The Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta

Division was identified as Frank Hitt,

and the Assistant

• Special Agent in Charge at that time was identified

as Jack Keith, Jr.

Mr. Reeves requested an additional interview

'of SA Rackleff in the Conference Room

at the

Headquarter's

of the Atlanta Police Department at 3:00 PM on that

same date for the purpose of displaying a replica

of the map recovered

from Ray's apartment. At 3:00

PM, a second interview was conducted by Mr. Reeves

and Mr. Walker. Mr. Reeves displayed what he

identified to be a replica of the map recovered from

Ray's apartment in April, 1968 and also displayed

a legal sized

handwritten paper showing separate

investigations conducted by SA Harry Lee, SA James

Riordan, and SA Rackleff in 1968.

The investigation

by SA Rackleff identified the streets and addresses

canvassed during the neighborhood investigation.

SA Rackleft explained

that he reported to the Atlanta

Office in about January 1968, and at the time of

the investigation of the King assassination, he was

not familiar with the streets and locations.

Rackleff was unable to recall specifically observing

the map displayed by Mr. Reeves, however,

did

identify three of the general areas marked as

being

the approximate location of the home and church of

Dr. King and the apartment of James Earl Ray near

14th Street and Peachtree Street, N.E. The fourth

marking on the map was identified as the area in

which SA Rackleff conducted

the above described

neighborhood investigation.

SA Rackleff

expressed his full and complete

cooperation with the investigation of Mr. Walker

and Mr. Reeves and Mr. Reeves stated they were very

much appreciative and

might request additional

interviews at a later date.

Atlanta noted in conducting this review, that

a few of the original Elsur logs had several entries made

with a light blue ink and as a result., these entries were

somewhat faint on the xerox copies Efforts to improve

the quality of these particular copies of the Elsur logs

were unsuccessful as the light blue ink does not copy

well.

It is noted that Atlanta has placed a three by

five card as a flag on the serials listed below, namely:

Atlanta Serials 157-582 A-33

135,

as these serials had information in various paragraphs,

that by its nature, identified a former confidential source

of the Atlanta Office and this information should be deleted

prior to being furnished to the HSCA. These three by five

card flags set forth the appropriate paragraphs that should

be deleted in these serials.

FBIHQ instructed that recipient offices using

the criteria set forth on page 2 of referenced teletype,

furnish

FBIHQ with two xerox copies of the MURKIN investigative

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1977

AG

202-739-2028

The FBI conducted a thorough investigation of the

assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a Department

of Justice task force concluded in a report released today by

Attorney General Griffin B. Bell.

The 149-page report was submitted by the task force

of the Office of Professional Responsibility following an

eight-month intensive review of FBI files and interview of

witnesses. The purpose of the study was to examine FBI

activities involving Dr. King and to evaluate the effectiveness

of the assassination investigation.

The report concluded that the FBI had conducted a

painstaking and successful investigation of the 1968

assassination in Memphis, Tennessee.

• The task force also found no evidence of FBI

complicity in the murder.

The only new evidence that was developed related to

details that did not affect the ultimate conclusion that James

Earl Ray was the properly convicted murderer:

The

task force of five attorney:

sand two research

analysts reviewed more than 200,000 documents from FBI

Headquarters and Field Office files and interviewed some 40

witnesses in its study of the King case.

On April 26, 1976, then Attorney General Edward H.

Levi directed the Office of Professional Responsibility, headed

by Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to review Department files to

determine:

(1) Whether the FBI investigation of Dr. King's

murder on April 4, 1968, at Memphis, Tennessee, was thorough

and honest;

(2.) Whether there was any evidence of FBI

involvement in Dr. King's death;

(3) Whether any new evidence had come to the

attention of the Department bearing on the assassination which

should be dealt with by the

proper authorities; and

(4) Whether the relationship between the FBI and

Dr. King called for criminal prosecution, disciplinary

proceedings, or other appropriate action.

• After reviewing the

murder investigation, the task

force turned to the pre-assassination security investigation of

Dr. King. The task force found that there may have been

an

arguable basis for the FBI to initiate a security investigation

on Dr. King, but continued that the security investigation

should

have been ended in 1963 and not continued until his death five

years later.

- 3 =

The FBI's COINTELPRO-type harassment of Di. King and

efforts to drive him out of the civil rights movement were found

to have been clearly improper.

Mr. Shaheen's report concluded that any criminal

action against FBI participants in the harassment campaign was

barred by the statute of limitations. The task force

recommended no disciplinary action because the chief FBI

officials responsible for the harassment are dead or retired.

The task force submitted recommendations for tighter

supervision of the FBI's domestic intelligence activities and

endorsed the Department's new guidelines in this area. The

cask force also proposed outright prohibition of COINTELPRO-type

activities against domestic intelligence sübjects.

I. INIRODUCIION

A. The Mission Of The Task Force

1. The Problem

On November 1, 1975, William C. Sullivan, former

Assistant Director, Domestic Intelligence Division,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified before the

Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations

with Respect to Intelligence Activities. He related that

from late 1963 and continuing until the assassination of

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., King was the target of an

intensive campaign by the F.B.I. to neutralize him as an

effective civil rights leader. Sullivan stated that in

the war against King 'No holds were barred." (Senate

Report No. 94-755, Final Report of the Select Coumittee

to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to

Intelligence Activities, Book II, p. 11). This and other

testimony describing this F.B.I. counterintelligence

campaign against King reached the public through the

news media. As a consequence there was a regeneration of

the widespread speculation on the possibility that the

Bureau may have had some responsibility in Dr. King's

death and may not have done an impartial and thorough

Investigation of the assassination.

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 185

## Page 186

2. The Attorney General's Directive

On November 24, 1975, the Attomey General of the

United States directed the Civil Rights Division of the

Department of Justice to undertake a review of the files

of the Department and its Federal Bureau of Investigation

to determine whether. the investigation of the assassination

of Dr. Martin Iuther King, Jr. should-be reöpered. More

particularly it was sought to be determined: (1) whether

any action taken in relation to Dx. King by the FBI before

the assassination had, or may have had; an effect, direct

or indirect, on that event, and (2) whether any action was

taken by the FBI which had, or may have had, any other

adverse effect: on Dr. King. Recormendations for criminal,

disciplinary.or.other appropriate action were réquested.

3. The Review up to April 26, 1976

In the next four months, the Assistant Attomey

General in charge of the Civil Rights Division, his

principal Deputy Assistant Attorey Ceneral and the

Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights

Division, acting as a review staff, variously read portions

of the FBI headquarters file on a person

- 2-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 186

---

## Page 187

who served as an adviser to Dy. King, portions of the FBI

headquarters security file on Dr. King himself, portions

of the FBI headquarters file on the assassination investi-

gation, some Department (as opposed to FBI) files relating

to DI. King, and other Bureau documents including everything

on Martin Luther King, JI., held in the late J. Edgar Hoover's

official, confidential and personal files.

By a memorandum to the Attorney General dated April

9, 1976, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the

Civil Rights Division submitted a 51 page report of the

Chief of the Civil Rights Division's Criminal Section dated

March 31, 1976, embodying the results of the three-man study,

limited to the above listed files, and concentrating almost

exclusively on the pre-assassination surveillance of, and

counterintelligence activities against, Dr. King.

The Assistant Attorney General recommended the

creation of a Departmental Task Force to complete the

review he and his team had begun. He also recommended an

Advisory Committee of distinguished citizens to advise with

the task force. The further review proposed included inter-

rogation of material witnesses, reading all the pertinent

field office files and reviewing all of the headquarters

files relating to DI. King and possibly to other civil rights

activists. A recoumendation was made to review tapes secured

-3-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 187

---

## Page 188

by electronic surveillance with a view to determining

which of such materials should be and could be legally

destroyed. The Assistant Attorney. General felt that

the FBI should assess the culpability of its agents

involved in the wrongdoing by the principals named in

the report. His memorandum to the Attorney General

concluded that probably criminal redress was time-

barred, that civil remedies might be available to

the King family but might also be more enbarrassing

than helpful, and hence that consideration be given

to a direct payment by the settlement process or by

a private bill to compensate the King survivors, or

with the survivors' concurrence; the King Foundation;

if this last issue were left to the task force or an

Advisory Commission, it should consider the pros and

cons. and recommend as it sees fit.

The Attomey General forwarded the Civil Rights

Division memoranda (and comments thereon from the Deputy

Attorney General, the Solicitor General, and from staff

members and the Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal

Division) to the Counsel, Office of Professional Respon-

sibility. The Attorney General charged the Office of

Professional Responsibility with the work of completing

the review begun by the Civil Rights Division. His memo-

randum states:

-4-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 188

## Page 189

"My request for the review

involved tour matters.

First, whether

the FBI investigation of the DI. Martin

Luther King's assassination was thorough

and honest; second, whether there was

any evidence that the FBI was involved

in the assassination of Dr. King; third,

in light of the first two questions,

whether there is any new evidence which

has come to the attention of the Depart-

ment concerning the assassination of DI.

King which should be dealt with by the.

appropriate authorities; fourth, whether

the nature of the relationship between

the Bureau and Di. King calls for criminal

prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or

other appropriate action.

As the fourth point, I again note

that from the partial review which has

been made, Mr. Pottinger concludes 'we

have found that the FBI undertook a system-

atic program of harassment of Martin Luther

King, by means both legal and illegal, ir

order to discredit him and harm both hin

and the movement he led.'

Assuming that

the major statutory violations relevant

24 and condict 242l de Po in er Seein

2, Mr. Pottinger's memo-

randum. concludes that any.prosecution.con-

templated under those acts would now be

barred by the five-year statute of limita-

tions with the possible exception which

would exist if there were proof of a con-

tinuing conspiracy.

As to the matter of new evidence

with respect to the assassination my under-

standing is that the Department has never

closed the Martin Luther King, file and

that numerous allegations of the possible

involvement of co-conspirators are promptly

investigated.

The thrust of the review which

I requested, however, was to determine

whether a new look at what was done by the

Bureau in investigating the assassination

or in the relationship between the Bureau

-5-

and Dr. King might give a different

emphasis or new clues in any way to

the question of involvement in that

crime. At this point in the review,

as I read the memoranda, nothing has

tumed up relévant on this latter

point.

commented upon his memorandum recommend

Pottinger also; has made other recommen-

dations upon which there is soine differ-

ence of opinion. In my view, it is

essential that the review be comleted

as soon as possible and in as thorough

a merner as is required to answer the

basic questions.

In view of what has

already been done, and the tentative

conclusions reached, special emphasis

should be given to the fourth question.

In conducting this review you should

call upon the Department to fumish

to you the staff you need.

My conclusion as to the review

conducted by the Civil Rights Division

is that it has now shown that this

complete review is necessary, particu-

larly in view of the conclusion as to

the systematic program of harassment.

It your review tums up matters for

specific action, we should discuss the

best way to proceed in each such case."

B. The Task Force And The Method Of Review

The Counsel of the Office of Professional Responsi-

bility selected three attorneys from the Civil Rights Division,

Joseph F. Gross, Jx., James R. Kieckhefer and William D. White,

one attorney from the Criminal Section of the Tax Division,

Division prosecutions. As the senior man the latter

was designated to head the task force. This committee

or task force began its work on May 4, 1976. 'The comittee

was further staffed by the addition of two research analysts,

Ms. Hope Byme and Mr. Geoffrey Covert, two secretaries,

Ms. Veronica Keith and Mrs. Renee Holmes, and tivo clerk-

typists, Mrs. Leroylyne Murray and Ms. Dana Boyd.

Consideration of a tentative outline for an eventual

report based on the chronology of events in the relationship

between Dr. Martin Luther King and the Federal Bureau of

Investigation brought the task force up against the fact

that the field of the history before the assassination had

just been plowed twice: once by the Civil Rights Division

memorandà of March 31, 1976, and April 9, 1976 and once

(among other kindred subjects) by the Senate Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence

Activities (Senate Report, No. 94-155 94th Congress, 2d

Session, Books II and III) .

By way of contrast, however, the matter of the assas-

sination of Dx. King and the ensuing investigation had been

judged by the Civil Rights Division's Assistant Attorney

General and his two assistants primarily on their famili-

arity with the Department file on the investigation as it

had progressed since 1968. The Civil Rights Division's

Martin Luther King, Jr., review memoranda reflected that

a study had been made of only the first 10 sections of the

FBI headquarters file on the assassination investigation

and only a random inspection was done of some of the remain-

ing 74 sections. There was no factual discussion or analysis.

The conclusion was reached by the Civil Rights Division staff

that "the Bureau's investigation was comprehensive, thorough.

and professional"' (Murphy memorandum of March 31, 1976, p. 6).

It was determined. therefore to begin the task force's study

with a complete review of the files on the FBI's investigation

of the assassination. It was the consensus of the review

team that by approaching the whole task by first examining

the character and completeness of the murder investigation

an answer could be made to the Attorney General's question

as to the Bureau's performance in that regard and also an

answer could be indicated to his question going to the Bureau's

possible responsibility, 1f any, direct or indirect, for

Dr. King's death.

After the examination of the FBI's Investigation of

the murder of Di. King, the review team proceeded to go

## Page 193

back and complete the inquiry into the Bureau's pre-

assassination relationship with Ds. King. Necessarily

included again in this second stage of our review was

the consideration of wether the FBI was in any way

Implicated in the murder directly or indirectly.

The task force rade a particular point of looking

at all the material in the FBI headquarters and field

office files on the Assassination Investigation, the so-

called 'Murkin File" (irkin being an acronym for Murder

of King) 1/; the Martin Iuther King Security File 2/; the

Cominfil-SCLC File (Cominfil being an acronym for Conmnist

infiltration; S.C.I.C., the initials for the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference) 3/; the file on Commist Influence

in Racial Matters 4/ and the advisor to King File 5/.

The "Muckin" file was solely concerned with the wider investi-

gation. The other four files provided a multi-focal view

no tapes

of the Bureau's intelligence and counterintelligence

activities with respect to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The scheme of citation hereinafter used will be to

minimize footnotes, place the source citation in the

body of the writing, and designate headquarters files

by "HQ" and number and serial and Field Office files

by city and number and serial, e.g.: (Memphis 44-1987-

153). Exceptions to this scheme will be explained when

made.

The more voluminous of the pertinent files in

addition to the FBI headquarters files and the Washington

Field Office files were located in Memphis, Atlanta,

Baltimore, Charlotte, Birmingham, New Orleans, Los Angeles,

San Francisco, Kansas City, St. Louis, Omaha; Chicago,

Springfield (Il1.), Milwaukee and New York. These were

examined in place by visits by task force persornel. The

remaining files were xeroxed and forwarded for review in

Washington. Pertinent newspaper clipping files maintained.

by the Department and by the Bureau and its field offices

were scanned.

In terms of papers examined, more than 200,000

entries, many with mmerous pages concerning both the

murder investigation and the security investigation were

covered. The five attorneys sitting together originally

-10-

NW 55220

Docid: 32989802 Page 194

## Page 195

and later, as the work progressed, splitting up to

work singly or in teams together with the research

personnel, considered separate sections of each file

compiling notes, carmenting on, or reading aloud, or

noting for reading by all of the camittee, items of

significance. Notes were taken, when pertinent items

were encountered, on a serial-by-serial basis ("serials"

being each separate document entry of one or more pages

in the file). The resulting books of notes were then

reviewed and used in conjunction with the original-source

serials for the development of the statements of fact

herein. In addition witness interviews were reflected

in contemporaneous memoranda which aided in the development

of the facts recited.

Selected portions of the so-called Official and

Confidential files which had been kept in the office of

the late J. Edgar Hoover, some sensitive files in the

office of a Section Chief in the FBI Security Division,

and the files of former Assistant Director William

Sullivan were reviewed. So also were the pertinent

files of the Attorneys General. The task force attorneys

reviewed the transcripts of key intercepted telephone

and microphone overheard conversations of DI. King

and his associates. These were spot checked

-11-

## Page 196

for accuracy against the tapes of those surveillances.

A canvass of other investigative agencies was made to

determine whether their files reflected that intelligence

or counterintelligence requests had been made upon them

by the FBI in relation to Dr. King. This included the

Defense Department, the State Department, the U.S.

Information Agency, the C.I.A., the Secret Service, the

Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service's

Intelligence Division and the Treasury Department's Bureau

of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The material tured up

by these agencies was examined, albeit little of consequence

was discovered.

Relevant portions of the investigation reports

of the Memphis Police Department on the King murder were

xeroxed and studied.

In addition to official files, the task force persomel

considered published material from the public sector dealing

with DI. Martin Iuther King, Jr., and his assassination.

Included in this category were a viewing of the Columbia

Broadcasting System's program on the death of King in its series

"The Assassins," a National Broadcasting Company Tomorrow"

program of April 4, 1974, and perusal of books and articles

on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the role

of the FBI in relation to the murder of Dr. King (see

Bibliography, App. A, Ex. 6). This lead to some valuable

-12-

## Page 197

evidentiary material - principally the oral and written

statements of James Earl Ray - which was used to buttress

the reconstruction of the facts of the murder and of the

FBI investigation.

Some 30 interviews were conducted, principally in

the assassination phase of the task force study. They were

helpful in supplementing the results of interviews done

during the murder investigation.

During the review of the Merphis Field Office files,

an on-site inspection of the crime scene was conducted and

the exhibits in the office of the Clerk of the County Court

for Shelby County, Tennessee, were examined.

II. THE ASSASSINATION INVESTIGATION

A. Events Surrounding April 4, 1968

1. The Poor People's Campaign

To understand the movements of Dr. King during this

critical period, it is necessary to briefly discuss the

Poor People's Campaign (POCAM), originally called the

Washington Spring Project in which he and the SCLC were involved.

POCAM was scheduled to begin the first week of April 1960,

and involved recruiting some 3,000 poor unemployed blacks

fxon 16 localities in the United States for the purpose of

going to Washington, D.C., and petitioning the goverrment to

improve their economic status (HQ 157-8428-51) .

The plan was to camp on the Washington Monument or

Lincoln Memorial grounds (HQ 157-8428-132). During the first

and second weeks, demands would be made of congressmen and

heads of departments, such as the Secretary of Labor. If the

demands were not met, nonviolent demonstrations were to be

conducted (HQ. 157-8428-109) .

Dr. King's planned travel schedule for February and

March included trips to 9 major cities and visits to various

points in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina

and Virginia (HQ 157 8428-75). By mid February Dr. King had

become discouraged with the lack of progress in recruiting and

- 14 -

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 198

---

## Page 199

training demonstrators (HQ 157-8428-206). During this low

point in the POCAM DI. King was pursuaded to alter his plans

and to go to Memphis, Ternessee, in support of a strike involving

the city's sanitation workers.

2. Memphis Sanitation Worker's Strike

On February 12, 1968, approximately 1,000 sanitation

workers employed by the city of Memphis called a wildcat

strike. The strikers were represented by Local 1733 of the

American Federation of State, County and Mmicipal. Employees

who demanded exclusive recognition of the union as bargaining

agent, setting up grievance procedures, wage improvements,

payroll deduction of union dues, and a pronotion system as well

as a pension, hospitalization and life insurance program.

(HQ 157-9146-X1) .

The NAACP intervened in the strike because all of

the sanitation workers, excluding drivers, were black. A.

militant young black power group known as the Invaders was

similarly interested in the strike. The group consisted of

about 15 members, mostly high school dropouts, and was a cell

of a larger group known as Black Organizing Power (BOP) headed

by Charles L. Cabbage and John B. Smith. The alleged purpose

of BOP was to stimulate a sense of black identity, black pride

and black consciousness in young blacks.

-15-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 199

---

## Page 200

The strikers were also supported by a group of black

ministers, connected with the Memphis Interdenominational.

Ministerial Alliance, who, adopted the name COME (Community on

the Move for Equality). It was members of this group that

were instrumental in bringing Dr. King to Memphis. On March 3,

1968, the Reverend James M. Lawson, JI., pastor of the

Centenary Nethodist Church, Memphis, and member of COME, stated

on a television program (WHBQ-IV) that he wanted to bring

Dr. King (and other heads of civil rights organizations) to

Memphis in an effort to unify the entire black commity

behind the demands of the strikers (HQ 157-9146-X23). The

intervention of these various black commity organizatións

caused the city of Memphis to be concerned about the racial

overtones of the strike and the possibility of violence

(HQ 157-9146-X1) .

Di. King made his first visit to Memphis in support

of the strike on the night of March 18, 1968. On that occasion,

in addressing an estimated crowd of 9,000 to 12,000 people at

a rally sponsored by COME at the Mason Temple, he called for

a general protest: day on March 22, 1968. All blacks were asked

not to go to work or school on that day and were urged to

participate in a massive downtown march. Dy. King and his

party stayed at the Lorraine Motel, 406 Mulberry Street, on

-16-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 200

---

## Page 201

the night of March 18, 1968 and left Memphis shortly before

noon on March 19, 1968, ostensibly to go to the State of

Mississippi in connection with the POCAM (HQ 157-9146-X39).

The City of Memphis was virtually paralyzed by a

16-inch snowfall on March 22, 1968, resulting in the post:

ponement of the plared mass march, to March 28, 1968. DI. King

returned to Memphis on the 28th, arriving at the airport at

approximately 10:22a.m. By that time approximately 5,000 to

6,000 people, about half of whom were of school age, had

congregated at the Clayborn Temple (located at 280 Hernando St.)

for the start of the march. According to the plan of the march,

the sanitation workers were in front with the remainder of the

people following behind.. The march was to proceed north on

Hernando to Beale Street, thence west on Beale Street to

Main Street and north on Main Street to City Hall:

The march got underway at approximately 11:00a.m. and

had proceeded to Hernando and Beale before it was joined by

DI. King. When the front of the march (led by Dr. King)

reached Main Street, teenagers and young adults at the rear

of the march near Third and Beale (two blocks from the front

of the march) ripped the signs off.their poles and began

breaking store windows and looting. Mass confusion developed

and the police moved in to quell the disturbance. The

-17-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 201

---

## Page 202

disruption of the march caused De. King's aides to commandeer

an automobile, and Dr. King and his party were escorted by

police to the Rivermont Hotel operated by Holiday Inns of

America. (HQ 157-9146-45). DI. King left the march at

11:15a.m. and checked into the Rivermont Hotel at 11:24a.m.

where he stayed until March 29, 1968. Dr. King and his party

were scheduled to return to Atlanta on March 28, 1968, at

9:05p.m. via Eastern Airlines and were scheduled to leave

Atlanta the moming of March 29, 1968, for Baltimore

(HQ. 157-9146-45). Thus, remaining in Memphis on the night

of the '28th was a change in plans.

The city ordered a 7:00p.m. curfew and approximately

• 3,500 members of the Tennessee National Guard were called out

to end the violence. During the disturbance four blacks were

shot, one fatally; approximately 150 fixes were set; and over

300 persons were arrested. Approximately one percent of the

marchers engaged in looting and violence and many of these were

people who were criminally inclined and who had been in previous.

trouble. The March 29, 1968; issue of the Memphis "Comercial

Appeal" reported that many of the looters and window breakers

were black power advocates. and that several wore jackets of

the "Invaders"'. However, other sources, including Lieutenant

E.H. Arkin of the Memphis Police Department, indicated that

-18-

, NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 202

---

## Page 203

many high school age students had put the word "Invaders" on

their jackets for effect and were not necessarily affiliated

with the BOP movement (HQ 157-9146-45). The violence and

disruption of the march was of great concern to Dr. King

because of the possible effect it might have on the plarned

POCAM. Therefore, he vowed to return to Memphis and

demoristrate that he had not lost his effectiveness in

leading nonviolent marches.

Dr. King, together with his SCLC staff, returned to

Memphis on April 3, 1968, at 10:33a.m. After a press

conference at the airport, the group proceeded to the Lorraine

Motel, arriving there at approximately 11:20a.m. At about

12:05p.m. Dr. King left the Lorraine Motel for a meeting at

the Centenary Methodist Church (Security and Surveillance Rept.

of G.P. Tines, Inspector, Memphis Police Department, dated

July 17, 1968). De. King arnounced at this meeting that his

purpose in returning to Memphis was to lead a mass march on

April 8, 1968 (HQ 157-9146-9 p.8):

However, on April 3, 1968, United States District

Court Judge Bailey Brown issued a temporary restraining order

against further marches in Memphis (HQ 157-9146-9, p.1).

Dr. King returned to the Lorraine Motel at 2:25p.m. and sometime

that afternoon Federal Marshals served him and his aides with

-19-

Page 203

---

## Page 204

the restraining order. (Security and Surveillance Rept. of

G.P. Tines, Inspector, Memphis Police Department, dated

July 17, 1968).

At approximately 4:00p.m. Dx. King and the SCLC staff

met with the BOP group at which time Charles Cabbage requested

money to institute BOP plans to start a "Liberation School"

and a 'Black Co-op"'. DI. King agreed to use his influence

to secure funds for BOP and Rev. Andrew Young agreed to help

write up a plan. It is believed these concessions were made

to BOP in order to keep them in line and prevent them from

following a violent pattern. (HQ 157-9146-9, р.9)

• On the night of April 3, 1968, Dr. King spoke to

approximately 2,000 persons at the Mason Temple. He emphasized

that the scheduled mass march must be held on April 8, 1968,

to re-focus attention on the eight-week old sanitation workers

strike.

After the speech, Solomon Jones, Jr., serving as

Dr. King's chauffeur drove him back to the Lorraine Motel.

De. King told Jones to report back on Thursday morning,

April 4, 1968, at 8:30a.m. because he had to appear in court

in connection with a restraining order. (Memphis 44-1987-2322

p. 51.)

3. DE. King's Activities on April 4, 1968

According to Mrs. Georgia M. Davis of Louisville,

Kentucky (FBI interview: HQ File 44-38861-2634, p.20) she,

Rev. A.D. Williams King, (DI. King's brother) and Mrs. Lucie

Ward arrived in Memphis on April 4, 1968, from Florida and

registered at the Lorraine Motel at approximately 1:00a.m.

Upon inquiring about Dr. King, they were told that he was

attending a strategy meeting at a church. The three then

• went to the church, but De. King was not there.

Returning to the motel, De. King's brother,

Mrs. Davis and Mes. Ward conversed in room 207 until they

observed Dr. King, along with Reverends Ralph Abernathy

and Bernard Lee, getting out of a taxicab in the motel

courtyard at about 4:30a.m. Dr. King was invited to room 207

where he visited with his brother, Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Ward

until about 5:00a.m. He then went to room 306 where he and

Rev. Abernathy were registered. About a half hour later

DI. King went to room 201 where he visited with Mrs. Davis

for approximately one hour. Afterwards he returned to room

306 for a strategy meeting scheduled for 8:00a.m.

Solomon Jones, JI., Dr. King's chauffer, returned

to the Lorraine Motel at about 8:30a.m. to take him to court.

-21-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802

Page 205

---

## Page 206

However, Rev. Andrew Young advised Jones that he was going to

court instead of De. King. Therefore Jones was requested

to remain at the motel. (4Q 44-38861-2322, р.51).

Dr. King remained at the motel the entire day,

returning to room 201 at about 1:30p.m. to visit Mes. Davis.

He was later joined in room 201 by his brother, Mrs. Ward,

Abernathy, Lee, Young, and Attorey Chauncey Eskridge.

The group conversed until about 5:45p.m. when Dr. King

announced they were going to dirner at the home of

Rev. Billy Kyles (HQ 44-38861-2634, p.23). E/ Enroute to

room 306 to dress, DI. King saw Solomon Jones, Jr. in the

motel courtyard and told him to start the car as they were

preparing to go to dirner (HQ 44-38861-2322, p.52) .

#/ There is a discrepancy in the exact time Dr. King retured

to room 305. Mrs. Davis places the time at 5:45p.m. However,

in an FBI interview, Rev. Abernathy stated that on April 4,

1968, he and Dr. King did not leave the motel and spent most

of the day in room 306. He further stated that he and Dr. King

ad been gone from their room for approximately one hour o

ess when they returned to the room at about 5:30p.m. to get

dressed for direr at the home of Rev. Billy Kyles. (HQ 44-38861-

2322, p. 48).

-22-

NW 55220

Docid: 32989802

## Page 207

At approximately 6:00p.m. Dr. King and Rev. Abernathy

started to leave room 306. Rev. Abernathy stopped for a

moment and DI. King walked out onto the balcony just outside

the door to the room (HQ 44-38861-2322, p.46). He saw Jones

standing beside the car on the ground level and began a

conversation about the weather. Jones advised DI. King

that he should put on a topcoat as it was cool outside.

During this conversation, Dr. King was facing west and Jones

was facing east and looking up at DI. King from the ground

level. As De. King acknowledged Jones' concern about getting

his topcoat, Jones heard a sound which he thought was a fire

cracker and De. King fell to the floor of the balcony in front

of room 306. Jones immediately called for help and a number

of Di. King's aides, who were either in their rooms or standing

in the courtyard, rushed to his side (HQ 44-38861-2322, p. 52). */

* Some critics of the FBI investigation have speculated that

Solomon Jones, Jr. set DI. King up for the assassination by

unduly detaining him on the balcony. Nothing in the evidence

reviewed by the task force lends any credence to such speculation.

4. FBI Intelligence and Local Police Activities

a. FBI Informants. Robert G. Jensen, the Special

Agent in Charge of the Memphis Field Office, and Joseph

Hester, case agent for MURKIN, have unequivocally assured

the task force that there was no electronic surveillance of

Dr. King in Memphis. It was explained that. Memphis was not in

the mainstream of Dr. King's SCC activities (Interview

of Special Agent Joe Hester, June 23, 1976, App.B) .

However, FBI agents did observe the sanitation worker's .

strike activities for intelligence purposes and the Memphis

Police Department (MPD) and confidential paid informants dia

supply. information to the field office (Interview of former

SAC Robert Jensen, July 7, 1976, App.B) .

Our investigation disclosed that there were five paid

confidential informants providing intelligence regarding the

racial situation to the Memphis Field Office on a continuing

basis. The intelligence coverage provided by these individuals

related to the activities of the Nation of Islam, Black Students

Association of MSU, Students for a Democratic Society, Black

Organizing Power, Black United Front, Afro-American Brother-

hood, Invaders and the sanitation workers strike. There is

-24-

NW 55220 DocId:32989802 Page 208

---

## Page 209

no evidence that the activities of these informants related

directly to DI. King. Moreover; there is no evidence

that would suggest that these informants were connected in

any way with the assassination of Dr.. King. (HQ 134-11867;

170-1841; 170-1922; 170-2530 and 137-4885.)

b. MPD Infiltration of the Invaders. In addition

to the paid FBI informants, an officer of the MPD infiltrated

the Invaders in an undercover operation. The officer who was

later exposed and is no longer with the MPD, was interviewed

by the task force. The undercover assignment began in

February of 1968 for the specific purpose of infiltrating

the Invaders who became active about the same time of the

sanitation workers strike. According to the officer the

MPD was primarily interested in the Invaders, not DI. King,

because the MPD was concerned about what they might do. The

police officer was, in fact, accepted as a member of the

Invaders and participated in their activities. On the

evening of April 4, 1968, when Dr. King was shot, the informant

had been on a shopping trip with Reverend James Bevel and

Reverend James Orange. The informant said he returned

to the Lorraine Motel at approximately 5:00p.m. and was

standing in the motel courtyard at the time Dr. King was

shot. He is positive that the shot that killed Di. King

-25-

came from the rear of the buildings which front on South

Main Street.

c. MPD Surveillance Detail and Removal of Detective

Redditt from Duty. * From the time of Dr. King's return

to Memphis on April 3, 1968, until the time of his

assassination, he was under physical surveillance by the

MPD. Upon learning of Dr. King's flight schedule, Inspector

G.P. Tines of the MPD Inspectional Bureau instructed to

black plainclothes officers, Detective Edward E. Redditt and

Patrolman Willie B. Richmond, to go to the airport to observe

the arrival of Dr. King and to keep him under continuous

surveillance in order to see with whom he came in contact.

According to Inspector Tines, the surveillance was ordered

because Dr. King was a controversial figure and had met with

local black militants on his prior visit to Memphis. While

at the airport a Mrs. Thomas Matthews pointed her finger at

Redditt and told him that she was going to get him. (Report

of G.P. Tines, July 17, 1968, Re: Security and Surveillance

of Dr. King, App. B.)

/ The removal of Redditt from duty was cited as one of the

bases for the House Select Committee to investigate the

assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.

- 26-

NW 55220 DocId:32989802 Page 210

---

## Page 211

In addition to the surveillance detail, Assistant

Chief of Police W.P. Huston ordered a detail of four men,

comnanded by Inspector Don H. Smith, to go to the airport

for the purpose of providing security for Dr. King. While

waiting for DI. King to arrive, Mrs. Thomas Matthews

advised Lieutenant George K. Davis that she had come to the

airport to pick up DI. King and that no one had asked for

police to be assigned to him. Inspector Smith also asked

Reverend James Lawson where they were going when they left

the airport and he replied: "We have not fully made up our

minds." Nevertheless, when De. King and his party left the

airport, Inspector Smith and his men followed then to the

Lorraine Motel, arriving there at approximately 11:20a.m.

With the assistance of Inspector J.S. Gaglian and two other

officers, Inspector Smith and his men secured the entrances

to the motel.

Dr. King and his party left the Lorraine Motel at

approximately 12:05p.m. and were followed by the security

detail to the Centenary Methodist Church where a meeting

was held. The detail secured the front and rear entrances

of the Church until approximately 2:15p.m. when Dr. King and

his group returned to the motel. The security detail then

returned to the motel area and resumed their positions until

they were ordered to headquarters by Chief J.C. Macdonald

-27-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 211

---

## Page 212

at approximately 5:05p.m. Inspector G.P. Tines stated in

his report that he was not conferred with and has no idea

why the security detail was removed from DI. King after

5:05p.m. Former Chief Macdonald has no present recollection

of the security detail (Interview of James C. Macdonald,

former Chief MPD, December 22, 1976, App. B.) The security

detail was not resumed on April 4, 1968, (Reports of

Inspectors Don H. Smith and J.S. Gagliano as incorporated

in Report of Inspector G.P. Tines, supra.)

As a separate activity fron the security detail,

Detective Redditt and Patrolman Richmond went to the airport

on April 3rd and observed Dr. King's arrival. When Dr. King

left the airport they followed him to the Lorraine Motel

and learned that he was registered in room 306. Redditt

telephoned headquarters and informed Inspector Tines where

DI. King was staying. At approximately 12:05p.m. Redditt

and Richmond followed Dr. King and his party to the

Centenary Methodist Church where a closed meeting of

approximately 30 black ministers was scheduled. Redditt

again called headquarters and advised his superiors of his

location. Redditt was instructed to leave Richmond at the

church and for him to return to the area of the Lorraine

Motel for the purpose of finding a suitable place where

close surveillance could be kept on the motel. Richmond

remained at the Centenary Methodist Church until the

-28-

## Page 213

meeting was over at approximately 2:15p.m. Richmond then

went to Clayborn Temple where he thought DI. King would

address the sanitation workers prior to a scheduled 3:00p.m.

march. However, Dr. King did not make an appearance there.

Richmond telephoned headquarters at about 3:30p.m. and was

advised that DI. King had returned. to the motel and that

Redditt had set up a surveillance post at Fire Station No. 2,

located at South Main and Butler streets. Richmond

immediately left Clayborn Temple and joined Redditt: at the

fire station. (Interview of Patrolman W.B. Richmond,

April 9, 1968, MPD Statements, State v. James Earl Ray

p. 1444).

The rear of Fire Station No. 2 overlooks the Lorraine

Motel and provided an excellent vantage point where Redditt

and Richmond could observe Dr. King and his associates as

they entered and left the motel. On April 3, 1968, Redditt

and Richmond remained at their observation post until 6:35p.m.

at which time they were relieved by Lieutenant E.H. Arkin

and Lieutenant J.V. Papia of the MPD Internal Security Bureau.

(Statement of Edward E. Redditt, April 10, 1968, MPD Statements,

State vs. James Earl Ray P. 1453).

After leaving their observation post, Redditt and

Richmond went to the Mason Temple where Dr. King was

-29-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 213

---

## Page 214

scheduled to address a mass meeting. Shortly after they

arrived at the temple, Redditt was approached by Reverend

Malcomb D. Blackburn and told that the word was out that

he was over in the fire station near the Lorraine Motel

spying with binoculars. Reverend Blackburn also advised

Richmond that the temple was the wrong place for him

because the tension was too high. Fearing they would be

exposed, Redditt and Richnond left the meeting at approximately

8:50p.m. (Report of Inspector G.P. Tines.)

Redditt and Richmond resumed their surveillance

of the Lorraine Motel from Fire Station No. 2 on April 4,

1968, at 10:30a.m. At approximately 12:50p.m. Redditt

received a threatening telephone call from a female ito

stated that he was doing the black people wrong, and they

were going to do him wrong. (Interview of Edward E. Redditt,

April 10, 1968.)

At approximately 4:00p.m., Redditt was ordered by

telephone to leave the fire station and report to headquarters

where he was advised that threats had been made on his life.

He was, therefore, ordered to move his family into a motel

under an assumed name by Frank Holloman, former Director

of Police and Fire, Memphis, Tenn. (Interview of Frank

Holloman, September 15, 1976, App. B.) Redditt was taken

-30-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 214

## Page 215

home in a squad car, but refused to move his family because

of a sick relative. At about the. time the squad car arrived

in front of Redditt's residence, it was arnounced on the

radio that Dr. King had been shot. After a couple of days,

Redditt did not hear any more about the threat on his life.

(Interview of Edward E. Redditt, July $, 1976, App. B.)

In our efforts to trace the source of the threat, we

have found that Philip R. Manuel, an investigator with the

Senate Investigating Cornittee, chaired by Senator McClellan

was in Memphis on April 4, 1968. While at the MPD Manuel

advised them based on a telephone call to his office in

Washington, that the Senate Cormittee Staff had information

from an informant in Mississippi that the Mississippi

Freedom Democratic Party had made plans to kill a 'Negro

lieutenant'' in Memphis. Manuel left Memphis on a 5:50p.m.

flight to Washington and the next day (April 5, 1968) he.

telephoned the MPD and. advised them that the threat was on

the life of a 'Negro lieutenant" in Knoxville rather than

Memphis. (Report of Inspector G.P. Tines, July 17, 1968,

supra.)

Philip R. Manuel neither has a, present recollection

of providing the information regarding the threat to the MPD,

nor does he have a memorandum of the event. However, he

-31-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 215

---

## Page 216

confirmed that he was in Memphis and visited the MPD at

the time stated and that his office did have a Mississippi

source. Moreover, he said the events sounded familar and

he believed the MPD records were correct. (Interview of

Philip R. Manuel, September 28, 1976, App. В.)

Although Redditt was relieved fron duty at Fire

Station No. 2, Richmond remained there and continued to

observe who entered and left the motel. At approximately

6:00p.m. Richmond saw Dr. King leave his room and walk

to the handrail on the balcony. The Reverend Billy Kyles

was standing off to Dr. King's right. An instant later

Richmond heard a loud sound similar to a shot and saw

De. King fall back from the handrail and put his hand up

to his head. At approximately 6:01p.m. Richmond telephoned

headquarters and reported that DI. King had been shot.

He was instructed to remain at the fire station. Richmond

then yelled to members of a MPD tactical squad (which had

stopped at the station a few moments earlier) that he

believed Dr. King had been shot. He then ran to the front

of the fire station and looked north and south on South Main

Street, but did not see anyone ruming or walking, except

the men in the tactical squad who left the fire station

running in different directions. Shortly thereafter,

-32-

## Page 217

Captain J.G. Ray arrived at the fire station and instructed

Richmond to go to headquarters and make a detailed report

of what he had seen. (Interview of Patrolman W.B. Richmond,

April 9, 1968, supra.)

d. Details of Two Black Firemen from Fire Station

No. 2.J/ As of April 3, 1968, Norvell E. Wallace and Floyd E.

Newsum were the only black firemen assigned to Fire Station

No. 2 of the Memphis Fire Department (MFD). Wallace was

working the night shift on April 3rd and Newsum was scheduled

to report for the day shift on April 4th. Both of these

individuals actively supported the sanitation workers strike,

attending their rallies and making financial contributions.

In our interview of Wallace (Interview July 8, 1976

App. B.) he stated that at about 10:00 or 10:30 on the night

of April 3id his captain told him that a call had come in

requesting that a man be detailed to Fire Station No. 33.

He was innediately detailed to No. 33 although it was raining

and he was preparing to go to bed. Wallace further stated

that while Fire Station No. 33 was understaffed as a whole,

there was no shortage of personel for the pump truck on which

he worked. Otherwise, he does not know why he was detailed.

*/• The details of the black firemen from Fire Station No. 2 is

a second reason cited as a basis for the House Select Camittee

to investigate the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.

-33-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 217

## Page 218

Also, on the night of April 3rd Fireman Newsum, in

a wholly personal capacity, attended a rally at the Mason

Temple where Dr. King made his last speech. When he returned

home (about 10:30p.m.) there was a message for him to call

Lt. J. Snith at the fire department. Wher he called,

Lt. J. Smith ordered him to report to Fire Station No. 31

on the morning of April 4th rather than Fire Station No. 2.

Newsun claims that Fire Station No. 31 was overstrength at

the time and his detail made his company short. Moreover,

he says he never has received a satisfactory explanation

why he was detailed. However, he did say that It. Barnett

at one time told him he was detailed at the request of the

police. (Interview of Floyd E. Newsum, July 8, 1976,

App. B.)

Interviews of past and present members of the MFD have

failed to disclose the individual who initiated the order or

the reason for detailing Wallace and Newsum. According to

former It. Jack Smith, he received a telephone call between

3:00p.m. and 5:00p.m. on April 3, 1968, fran either Captain

James I. Baity or former Assistant Chief Arthur J. Rivalto

in the personnel department specifically requesting that

Newsum be detailed. No reason was given for the detail.

Smith said he immediately called Newsum, but Newsum was not

-34-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 228

---

## Page 219

home. Therefore, Smith left a message for Newsum to call

the fire station. Newsum called about 10:30p.m. and Smith

advised him of the detail (Interview of Jack Smith, dated

September 27, 1976).

Wallace's commanding officer, then Captain R.T.

Johnson, likewise stated that he received a telephone

call fran someone in the persormel department requesting

him to detail Wallace. However, Johnson has no present

recollection of who the individual was that made the

request. (Interview of R.I. Johnson, Deputy Chief, Memphis

Fire Department, December 21, 1976, App. В.)

Neither Captain Baity nor former Assistant Chief

Rivalto has any present recollection of the detail of

Wallace or Newsum.

Captain Baity indicated that any

district chief could have ordered the men moved (Interview

of James I. Baity, September 27, 1976, App. B). Also,

former Assistant Chief Rivalto said the fire department

shifted people around all the time when a campany became

understrength because of sickness, etc. (Interview of

Arthur J. Rivalto, September 27, 1976, App. B).

Similarly, the former Chief of the MFD, Edward A.

Hamilton, has no recollection of the details. He speculated

that the men could have been detailed for a "fill in" to

bring a company up to strength (Interview of Edward A.

Hamilton, September 27, 1976, App. B) .

The MFD Strenth Report-Firefighting Personnel for

Shift "A"', Battalions One and Eight, dated April 3, 1968

(attached to Reinterview of Janes R. Boatwright, October 20,

1976, App. B) show that Wallace's Company No. 2 at Fire

Station No. 2 was operating at minimum strength (five men)

after he was detailed; whereas Company No. 33 to which he

was detailed operated at one over the minimin strength

(four men) after the detail. Likewise, the Strength Report

for Shift "B" for Battalions One and Two, dated April 4,

1968 (Also attached to the Boatwright interview of October 20,

1976) show that Newsum's Company No. 55 at Fire Station No. 2

was operating at minimum strength (five men) after the detail,

but Company 31 to wnich he was detailed operated at one over

the minimum strength (four men) after the detail.

However, former Deputy Chief James O. Barnett stated

that the people on the security detail operating out of

the fire station probably felt better without Wallace and

Newsun around (Interview of James 0. Barnett, September 27,

1976.) On the other hand, Assistant Chief James R. Boatwright

explained that they were having a very tense situation at

the time; that a number of threatening calls had been

received at Fire Station No. 2; and that the consensus of

opinion was that Wallace and Newsum were detailed for their

own protection, since they were the only black firemen assigned

to that station (Interview of James R. Boatwright, September 23,

1976).

-36-

## Page 221

In this connection MPD Patrolman Willie B. Richnond

and former Detective Edward E. Redditt, who conducted the

surveillance of Dr. King and his associates fron the fire

station, were recontacted and specifically asked wnether

they had requested that Wallace and Newsun be detailed.

Both Richmond and Redditt denied that they made such a

request or had Inowledge of any one elsé in the police

department making such a request (Reinterviews of Richmond

and Redditt, September 28, 1976, App. B).

Our investigation has not disclosed any evidence

that the detail of Wallace and Newsum was in any way

connected with the assassination of Dr. King. However,

the circumstances surrounding the details strongly suggest

that both men were detailed because they supported the

sanitation workers and were considered to be a threat to .

the security of the surveillance of Dr. King conducted from

the fire station by Patrolman Richmond and Detective Redditt.

e: MPD Tactical Units- Their Deployment and

Activities on the Evening of April 4, 1968. When the sanitation

workers of Memphis began their strike in February of 1968, the

MPD either organized. or beefed up various tactical units.

Generally, each of these nits consisted of 12 law enforcement

officers from the MPD and the Shelby County Sheriff's Department.

-37-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 221

## Page 222

These units were organized for the purpose of avoiding riots

which other cities, such as Detroit, had experienced (Interview

of Frank Holloman, former Director of Fire and Police for the

City of Memphis, September 15, 1976, App. B). Documents

obtained from the State's Attorney General (Item 9 from MPD

Miscellaneous Records) show that on the evening of April 4,

1968, at the time Dr. King was shot, there were nine tactical

units in service at various locations as follows:

In addition to the tactical units, the documents

obtained from the State's Attorney General show that there

were ten regular police cars (with 3 to 4 men per car) in

the general area of the Lorraine Motel. These cars were

at the following locations at the time Dr. King was shot:

The map (Part of Iten 9 from MPD Miscellaneous

Records, see App. A, Ex. 1) shows that Tact Units 10 and 18

were within a radius of one mile of the crime scene (200

block of Mulberry Street) at the time of the shooting; and

Tact Units 6,I1 and 12 were within a radius of two miles

of the scene. Tact hits 7,14,15 and 16 were located outside

the boundaries of the map and äre not shown. Cars rumber

224,230;232,245 and 247 were within a radius of one mile of

the scene and cars number 228 and 369 were within a radius

of two miles. However, cars number 236,365 and 367 were

outside the boundaries of the map.

Particular emphasis is given to Tact Unit 10 and

the activities of its men, as this it was located at

Fire Station No. 2 (S. Main and Butler) at the time of the

- 39=

## Page 224

shooting. On the afternoon of April 4, 1968, Tact Unit 10,

consisting of three cars and 12 men stopped at Fire Station

No. 2 for a rest break at approximately 5:50p.m. The mit

was carnanded by Lt. 'Judson E. Ghormley of the Shelby County

Sheriff's Department. The other members of the unit included

Deputies W.A. DuFour, W.J. Berry, Vernon Dollahite, R.N. Baker

and Ronald Maley of the sheriff's department; and Patrolmen

Carroll Dunn, William Gross, Jason Morris, Barney Wright,

Enmett Douglass and Torrance Landers of the MPD.

Interviews of the above named men indicate that when

the unit arrived at the fire station, the cars were parked

on the north side of the fire station entrance with the lead

car actually obstructing the sidewalk. The second car was

parked directly behind the lead car and the third car was

double parked alongside these two cars. (MPD Statements,

State v. James Earl Ray, DuFour p. 1449; Berry p.1450;

Ghormley pp.1451 and 1532; Dollahite pp.1455 and 1505;

Baker p.1468; Douglass p.1469; Landers p.1471 and Maley

p. 1480.)

While Patrolman Douglass renained with the lead car

to monitor the radio, all of the other men went into the fire

station to take a break. When the shot was fired that killed

Dr. King (at approximately 6:01p.m.), these men were at various

-40-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 224

---

## Page 225

locations in the fire station drinking coffee, making telephone

calls, etc. Patrolman Richmond, who was marning the surveillance

post in the rear of the station, yelled throughout the station

that Dr. King had been shot. The members of the tact nit,

some of whom had heard the shot, all ran out the north side

of the fire station and then east toward the rear of the fire

station and the Lorraine Motel. (See diagram of crime scene,

App. A. Ex. 2) .

Patrolman Douglass, who had remained in the lead car

to monitor the radio, heard the shot when it was fired. He

innediately got out of the car and ran toward the rear of the

fire station with the other men. After Patrolman Douglass

realized what had happened, he returned to the lead car, along.

with Patrolman Wright, and radioed the dispatcher that Dr. King

had been shot. Douglass and Wright then drove the lead car

south on S. Main to E. Butler, east on E. Butler to Mulberry

and north on Mulberry, to the entrance of the Lorraine Motel.

Douglass and Wright later drove the car, accompanied by one

or two other unidentified officers, north on Mulberry to

Huling, west on Huling to S. Main and south on S. Main to the

front of the buildings located just north of the fire station. */

* There are conflicts in the statements of Douglass, Wright

and Ghormley:

Douglass stated that Chormley and other unidentified

officers got in the car with him at the fire station and they drove

to the lorraine Motel. According to Wright's version, he and

Douglass left the fire station together and picked up one or two

other unidentified officers at the Lorraine Motel. On the other

and, Ghormley claims he turned around at the concrete wall at tr

eat of the fire station and ran to the front of the station an

then north on S. Main Street.

-41-

## Page 226

The other men in the tact unit continued to the rear

of the fire station to a concrete retaining wall abutting

Mulberry Street. DuFour, Dollahite, Morris, Baker, Landers,

Maley and Dum climbed down the concrete wall and ran across

Mulberry Street to the Lorraine Motel. Dufour and Morris ran

up the stairs to the balcony where Dr. King's body lay.

The people there said the shot had come from a red brick

building north of the fire station on S. Main Street. While

Dufour remained with Dr. King's body until the ambulance came,

Morris ran north on Milberry to Huling and west on Huling to

the north side of the buildings facing S. Main Street. Another

officer (probably Maley or Dum) was already at that point,

and Morris stopped there to assist him in securing that area.

Baker ran to the Motel balcony where DuFour was standing

beside Dr. King's body. He then ran back to Mulberry St. and

ran north for a distance to an alley. Baker ran into the

alley looking for anything suspicious. He noticed that

other members of the tact unit were securing a building

(probably the building with its north end on Huling).

Therefore, Baker went to the corner of Mulberxy and E. Butler

and took up a position there.

After Landers learned the direction the shot came

from, he found a 55-gallon drum and climbed back up the

concrete retaining wall on Mulberry St. into the lot on

-42-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 226

---

## Page 227

which the building where the shot was fired is located. Landers

observed that the bathroom window was partially opened and

he saw an elderly white male come up to the window and look out ,

He ordered him to get back fran the window. Landers also saw

an elderly white female looking out a window directly south

of the bathroom window. He ordered her to get away from the

window. Landers also checked the bushes on the lot for

evidence and checked the entire area for footprints. After

other officers arrived, Landers and another MPD officer

climbed onto the roof of a one story building which backs

up to Mulberry St. This building runs along the north side

of the building whence the shot was fired. Finding nothing

on the roof, they came down and started up an alley leading

to a basement. About 10 feet up the alley they found two

fresh footprints in the mud. Landers guarded these footprints

until homicide detectives arrived on the scene. Subsequently,

a plaster case was made of each footprint. However, the

footprints were never positively identified by either the

MPD or the FBI.

Upon learning where the shot was fired from, Dollahite

and Maley ran out of the motel courtyard, turned north on

Mulberry to Huling and west on Huling toward S. Main. Maley

stopped in the center of the block and began guarding the

-43-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 227

---

## Page 228

north end of the building. However, Dollahite continued running

(with gun drawn) to S. Main and turned south on S. Main.

Dollahite noticed a number of patrons in Jim's Grill at 418

S. Main. He ran into the cafe and ordered everyone to remain

seated and not to leave. Dollahite then stopped momentarily

at Canipe's Amusement Company located at 424 S. Main where

he observed a green bed spread lying in the doorway partially

covering a blue suitcase and a box containing a rifle. As he

continued down S. Main a short distance near a fenced-in

parking area, Dollahite observed It. Ghormley and another

officer coming north on S. Main. Dollahite turned around

at that point and walked back to Canipe's store ahead of

Lt. Ghormley and then crossed the street for the purpose of

securing the front of the building. After he took up his

position, Douglass and Wright drove up in the lead car.

Other officers who did not climb down the retaining

wall at the rear of the fire station and run to the motel

are Ghormley, Gross and Berry. After running to the

retaining wall and observing the people pointing to the

building on S. Main St., Berry came back to the fire station

entrance, jumped in a cruiser and drove north on S. Main to

the first intersection at Huling where he stopped the car

in the street and secured that area.

-44-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 228

---

## Page 229

Ghormley and Gross also returned to the front of

the fire station after first ruming to the retaining wall.

They both turned north on S. Main and ran toward Huling.

Ghormley stopped at Canipe's Amusement Co. where he observed

what appeared to be a blanket partially covering a blue

suitcase and a Browning rifle box with about a foot of the

barrel of a rifle exposed.

The apparent discrepancies in the statements of

Chormley and Dollahite can be accounted for only by the

mass confusion which must have occurred immediately after

the shooting. Howéver, it appears that Dollahite first

observed the bindle while running south on S. Main with

his gun drawn. But, he continued past Canipe's Amusement

Company and after he saw Chormley and the other officer

coming north he turned around and took up a position on the

opposite side of the street from Canipe's.

Guy H. Canipe, the owner of Canipe's Amusement Co.,

informed Chormley that a white male had just dropped the

bundle in front of his door a minute or two earlier and had

run south on S. Main. Ghormley radioed this information to

headquarters and stood guard over the articles. Shortly there-

after, Canipe told Chormley that a white Mustang automobile

had left the area at a high rate of speed after the bundle was

dropped. Ghormley also radioed this information to headquarters.

According to the transcript of the MPD radio tapes

(MPD James Earl Ray Supplements, Attorney General's copy,

Supplement 79, p.1714) Tact Unit 10 advised the dispatcher

that Dr. King had been shot at the Lorraine Motel at 6:03p.m.

By 6:06p.m., the dispatcher had ordered a circle formed

around the Lorraine Motel and the buildings west of the

motel on S. Main. Moreover, patrol cars and other Tact

Units had begun to arrive on the scene. At 6:07p.m. Tact

Unit 10 advised the dispatcher that the weapon was in front

of 424 S. Main and that the subject ran south on S. Main.

At 6:08p.m. the subject was described as a well-dressed, young,

white male. At 6:10p.m. the dispatcher relayed infornation

from Tact Unit I0, that the subject had left the area in a

late model white Mustang.

The men in the Tact Units and patrol cars kept the

area sealed off, directed traffic, and checked out suspicious

individuals while detectives from the Homicide Squad investi-

gated the scene. Inspector Nevelyn E. Zachary of the MPD

Homicide Squad arrived at the Lorraine Motel at approximately

6:15p.m., and by 6:30p.m. he had taken custody of the bundle

of articles found in the doorway of Canipe's Amusement.

Zachary. turned the bundle, except for a tee shirt and pair

of shorts, over to the FBI at about 9:30 or 10:00p.m. The

tee shirt and shorts were also turned over to the FBI after

the laundry marks were checked with local laundries (Interview

of former Inspector Nevelyn E. Zachary, September 15, 1976,

B. The FBI Investigation Of The Assassination

1. The Department of Justice Response and FBI

Performance

a. The Murder. At approximately 6:00 p.m. on

April 4, 1968, Dx. Martin Luther King,

JI., was standing

on the balcony outside of his room at the Lorraine Motel

in Memphis, Ternessee. Moments later, Dr. King was shot

by a high power rifle and then rushed to St. Joseph's

Hospital. At 7:05 p.m. he was pronounced dead. The

cause of death was a bullet wound which tore the major

neck blood vessels and severed the spinal cord at the

root of the neck (Memphis 44-1987 Sub sec. 1-13, and see

aitopsy report, App. A, Ex. 3).

b. Top Priority Investigation Ordered. The Memphis

Police Department was immediately aware of the King assault

and promptly notified the FBI Memphis Field Office headed by

SAC Robert G. Jensen. SAC Jensen telephonically relayed the

information to Washington where Director Hoover and Attorney •

General Clark were informed. The Memphis Field Office was

directed on the evening of April 4, 1968 to immediately conduct

a full investigation of the matter as a possible violation

of 18 U.S.C. 241, the civil rights conspiracy statute (HQ 44-

38861-109).

-47-

## Page 232

This directive soon became national in scope with

SAC's in all FBI Field Offices being ordered by teletype

on April 7, 1968, to participate and conduct a top priority

investigation under their personal supervision.. This meant

all leads were to be afforded immediate, thorough and

imaginative attention and all possibilities from such leads

exhausted. Also, 24 hours was set as the period after receipt

of a lead within which the investigation and reporting must

be completed. All SAC's were to bear personal responsibility

for any failure to handle the investigation (HQ 44-38861-153).

c. Progress of the Investigation. The breadth of

this top priority investigation 1s repeatedly evidenced in

the Murkin files. All informant sources - racial, security

and criminal - were immediately alerted and contacted for

information. The KKK and other hate groups as well as

individuals known to have violent proclivities were checked.

The files were checked for prior threats against Martin Luther

King, Jr. (HQ 44-38861-2649). Name checks were continuously

being made on Selective Service records, city and telephone

directories, drivers license bureaus, motor vehicle divisions,

financial institutions, credit records, criminal and civil

records, marriage licenses, public utility rolls, unions,

common carrier passenger lists and more (e.g. HQ 44-38861-233).

(1) Bessie Brewer's Rooming House. Key information

was developed early at Bessie Brewer's Rooming House whence

## Page 233

the shot was fired. Bessie Brewer, Charles A. Stephens

and William C. Anchutz were interviewed and a physical

description of a suspect was obtained.

Bessie Brewer, resident manager of the rooming house,

explained that a "John Willard" registered with her April 4,

between 3:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. He was first directed to

Room 8, but rejected it because it had a stove and refrig-

erator. Instead, he asked for a sleeping room only and

accepted Room 5-B in the rear of the hostelry. This room

provided a window with a view of Dr. King's room at the

Lorraine Motel. Mrs. Brewer described the new tenant as

a white male approximately 35 years of age, 5'11" to 6' tall,

weighing 180 pounds with a medium build and presenting a neat

clean appearance (Memphis 44-1987 Sub Sec. 1-15).

Stephens, who was in his room on the afternoon of

April 4, remembers hearing footsteps between Room 5-B

and the bathroom. He also remembers the bathroom being

occupied for considerable periods of time - 20 to 30 minutes -

without water running or the toilet being flushed except for

the last visit. This last visit ended when he heard what

he is certain was a gun shot. Interrupted by the shot,

Stephens opened his door to the hallway to see a man ruming

down the hallway carrying a large wrapped bundle. As this

man ran down the hall in the direction of Anchutz, Stephens

-49-

NW. 55220 DecId:32989802 Page 233

---

## Page 234

recalls believing that he had seen this person earlier

that afternoon with Mrs. Brewer. Stephens described him

as a white male of average build, in his 30's, 5'10" to 11"

tall, weighing 165 pounds and wearing a dark suit presenting

a neat clean appearance (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A sec. 1).

Like Stephens, Anchutz was a resident of the rooming

house and in his room at the time of the shooting. Also

Like Stephens, Anchutz occupied a room adjacent to "John

Willard." He recalls watching television in his rcom that

afternoon when he heard a gun shot. Immediately, he went

to the door and as he opened it saw a man running toward him.

This man covered his face as he ran and carried a blanket

wrapped bundle. Anchutz addressed the man, saying: "I

thought I heard a shot." The man responded: "Yeh, it was a

shot." Anchutz described the man as 6' tall with a slim

build and in his 30's (Memphis 4!1-1987 Sub A sec. i).

(2) Canipe Amusement Company. The Canipe Amusénent

•Company is located at 424 South Main Street and is just a

short distance from Bessie Brewer's Rooming House at 422%

South Main Street. In the recessed entrance to Canipe Company

a blanket wrapped bundle (presumably, the bundle Stephens

and Anchutz saw) containing valuable pieces of physical

evidence was recovered shortly after the shooting.

-50-

## Page 235

The store owner, Guy W. Canipe, and two customers,

Bernell Finley and Julius I. Graham, were in the store at the

time of the assassination. Each was interviewed by the

FBI and described hearing a "thud" which drew their attention,

and as they looked to see what had happened, they observed

the blanket wrapped bundle in the entrance. At the same

time, they saw a man dressed in a dark suit walking rapidly

south on the sidewalk away from the bundle. A few moments

later, they said, a white compact autonobile - possibly a

Mustang - proceeded north on South Main Street at a high

rate of speed. The male was described as white, approximately

30 years of age with a medium build, 5'10"' to 6' tall and

weighing 160 to 180 pounds. (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A sec 1).

The bundle, after being discovered at Canipe's doorway

by a member of a Memphis Police Department Tactical Squad,

first came into the custody of Inspector Zachary of the

Memphis Police Department's Houicide Bureau. Later in the

evening of April 4, 1968, between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.,

Inspector Zachary delivered the bundle to SAC Jensen who

immediately had it flown by agent courier to Washington for

laboratory examination (Memphis 44-1987-610). The bundle

contained a Model 760 Remington Camemaster rifle, 30-06

Springfield caliber, and a blue zipper bag. The bag contained

various toilet articles along with a pair of men's underwear

with laundry tags, a pair of binoculars, two cans of

beer, and a paper bag bearing an advertisement for York

Arms Company, Memphis, Ternessee, with a York Arms Company

cash sales receipt dated April 4, 1968 Memphis 44-1987

Sub A sec 1).

(3) Information and Physical Evidence Tracked. The

investigation continued with emphasis on tracing all physical

evidence and information received. To this end a search

of all Memphis area hotels and motels was initiated for

the source of the blanket and bar of soap found in the blue

zipper bag. Also, registrations at area ins were examined

for the unknown suspect who fled the rooming house and wiro.

might be driving a white compact automobile. At the same

time, the rifle, scope, binoculars, cans of beer, laundry

tags and other items were tracked (HQ 44-38861-139) •

The rifle and scope were quickly traced to the Aero

Marine Supply Company in Birmingham, Alabama. The rifle

was sold to a 'Harvey Lowlyer" March 30, 1968. The scope,

along with a second rifle, was purchased March 29, 1968,

but "Lowwyer" exchanged this rifle the following day for

the one recovered at the Canipe Amusement Company. Accord-

ing to the Aero Marine salesnan, "Lownyer" explained that

he talked with his brother and was advised a more powerful

rifle was necessary for deer hunting in Wisconsin. However,

-52-

NW 55220

## Page 237

a laboratory examination of this returned rifle revealed

that it was clogged with cosmoline (a heavy grease firearm

preservative) and could not be loaded and readied to fire

(HQ 44-38861-432). The salesman also provided a physical

description of "Lownyer" which matched those previously

obtained (HQ 44-38861-180).

The paper bag and the sales receipt from York Arms

Company led agents to the Memphis store where the binoculars

were purchased. The York Arms salesman explained that he

sold the pair of binoculars at approximately 4:00 p.m.

April 4, 1968, to a white male matching the descriptions

previously obtained (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A sec. 1). By

checking the manufacturer's can codes and distribution records,

the two beer cans were traced to Southhaven Mirnow Shop,

Southhaven, Mississippi (HQ 44-38861-1360).

The center of the investigation shifted from Memphis

to Birmingham on April 9, when the search of Memphis inns.

focused on the Rebel Motel and the April 3 registration

record of an Eric Starvo Galt. It was already known that

the rifle and scope were purchased in Birmingham and the

Galt registration also pointed to Birmingham. The registra-

tion record aroused interest because Galt registered for the

night of April 3 only, listed a Birmingham address and drove a

Mustang with Alabama license plates, (HQ 44-38861-1180).

-53-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 237

---

## Page 238

The possibility of a link between Eric Starvo

Galt and the unknown subject was pursued in Alabama by the

Birmingham and Mobile offices. In their pursuit they

learned that on August 29, 1967, Galt purchased a 1966

white Mustang automobile. The Bureau agents also learned

that the State of Alabana issued a motor vehicle operator's

license in October 1967 to Eric Starvo Galt, 2608 Highland

Avenue, Birmingham, Alabama. The physical description

obtained from this license matched those previously received:

white male, bom July 20, 1931, 5'11" tall, 175 pounds with

blue eyes and brown hair (HQ 44-38861-1180).

When the investigation moved to Galt's Birminghan

address it was learned that Galt lived there in late August

until early October 1967. Because of the length of this

contact, emphasis was placed on developing information on

Galt's background. Significantly, it was leamed that during

his Birmingham sojour Galt expressed an enthusiastic

interest in dancing and attended dancing school there

(HQ 44-38861-607).

(4) Los Angeles. Soon after the Birmingham connection

was uncovered Los Angeles became a focal point in the investi-

gation. The significance of Los Angeles became apparent

April 11, with the knowledge of four facts.

One, when on April 11, 1968, the Bureau located Galt's

abandoned Mustang in Atlanta a search of it indicated that

-54-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 238

---

## Page 239

Galt had had it serviced twice in the Los Angeles area

(Q 44-38861-989) .

Two, also incident to the search of the Mustang a

fragment of cardboard torn from a Kleenex box was found.

On it were the names and Los Angeles addresses of Anita'

Katzwinkel and Ginger Nance (HQ 44-38861-989)

Three, laundry markings from the recovered underwear

were tracked to Home Service Laundry and Dry Cleaning,

Hollywood, California (HQ 44-38861-885). The following

day agents learned that the name Eric Starvo Galt appeared

in the laundry's records.

Lastly, a pair of pliers recovered from the blue

zipper bag were traced to the Rompage Hardware Store which

is within five blocks of Home Service Laundry and Dry

Cleaning (HQ 44-38861-1174).

Since it was known that while in Birmingham Gält

pursued an interest in dancing, all dance schools in the

Los Angeles area were checked. Galt's name appeared in

the records of the National Dance Studio, Los Angeles.

(44-38861-1293).

Eventually, the dance studio contact proved to be

most important because it was through an interview with the

dance studio owner that a photograph of Eric Starvo Galt was

finally obtained. The owner keyed the agents to an interest

-55-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 239

---

## Page 240

Galt had expressed in attending a bartending school

(HQ 44-38861-1066). Checking the area, the Intemational

School of Bartending was located and it provided Galt's

graduation photograph. For the first time, agents were

able to see and distribute a photo of their subject. To be

sure of maximum dissemination, the photo was circulated among

the news media (HQ 44-38861-967) .

While in Los Angeles Galt first lived at the Serrano

Apartments and later at the St. Francis Hotel. Persons

contacted at these locations called him a "loner" and

described him as a person who:kept to himself. A departure

from this characterization, however, was reported by Charles

Stein who, at no expense to himself, rode with Galt in the

Mustang from Los Angeles to New Orleans and return.

Stein explained that he and his sister Rita Stein met

Galt through their cousin Marie Martin who was working as a

bar maid at the Sultan Bar located in the St. Francis Hotel.

Galt had mentioned to Martin that he was planning to drive

to New Orleans and she asked if he would be willing to give .

her cousin a ride there in order to pick up her children.

He agreed, but it was Charles and not Rita who went along

with Galt (HQ 44-38861-1117).

Notwithstanding the information Stein provided, the

investigation moved no closer to locating Galt. New Orleans

-56-

NW 55220

Docid: 32989802 Page 240

---

## Page 241

was scoured for clues and although Galt's hotel and room

were located the effort was fruitless (HQ 44-38861-1197).

Stein also stated Galt made several telephone calls from

pay telephones along the way but an exhaustive search of

countless telephone records, numbers and subscribers

produced nothing (e.g. HQ. 44-38861-3857). Lastly, Stein

explained that Galt conditioned the ride to New Orleans

on Charles Stein, Rita Stein and Marie Martin joining

George Wallace's American Independent Party. Each joined

but again the ensuing investigation of this lead learned

nothing (HQ 44-38861-1003) •

(5) Atlanta. On April 11, 1968, a citizen call came

through to the Atlanta Police Department reporting the missing

white Mustang. According to this caller and another person,

both interviewed by the FBI, the abandoned Mustang was parked

shortly before 9:00 a.!. April 5, 1968, by a lone man matching

Galt's description.

The discovery of Galt's Mustang immediately

caused agents to seek out any additional contacts by Galt in

Atlanta (HQ 44-38861-989).

Because Galt was believed to use low cost rooming houses

all such establishments were contacted for any sign of him.

Success was found at Jimmie Dalton Gardner's Rooming House

where Galt registered March 24, 1968. Although Galt was

nowhere to be found, he had left evidence behind. Found

-57-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 241

## Page 242

in his room were a booklet, 'Your Opportunities in Lock-

smithing" and a collection of maps. One of these maps

was of the city of Atlanta with the residence of Martin

Luther King, Jr., and the headquarters of SCLC circled

(HQ 44-38861-967) .

Other evidence of Galt's presence in Atlanta was

received from the Piedmont Laundry where records showed

he picked up Laundry April 5, 1968 (HQ 44-38861-3627).

(6) Galt Identified as James Earl Ray. Knowing that

Galt returned to Atlanta after the assassination all con-

ceivable modes of transportation in, around and out of

Atlanta were checked (HQ 44-38861-907). However, Galt's

trail was cold; there was no evidence as to where he fled

from Atlanta.

The Bureau became worried because with each passing

hour Galt's chances of avoiding capture became better and

better. Therefore, the investigative emphasis shifted from

following Galt's trail to identifying Galt. In an effort

to accomplish this the Bureau initiated a comparative search

of three identical latent fingerprints believed to be Galt's

(one fingerprint was recovered from the rifle; a second from

the binoculars; and a third from the map of Atlanta found

in Galt's room) against fingerprints of white male fugitives.

To be sure, the limitation to fugitives was purely speculative.

-58-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 242

---

## Page 243

However, the speculation paid off when on April 19, 1968,

James Earl Ray's fingerprint card compared identically

(HQ 4438861-1575) .

With the discovery that Eric Starvo Galt was James

Earl Ray, the investigation was redirected to a search

of Ray's whereabouts since the time of his April 23, 1967,

escape from Missouri State Prison. Through the months of

April and May the Ray-Galt steps were traced. Eventually,

the Bureau was able to account for Ray's whereabouts almost

continuously since his escape. Nevertheless, his trail

remained cold beyond Atlanta on April 5, 1968 (HQ 44-38861-

3509; and see Chronology infra).

In connection with their search, Ray's family was

identified, located, physically surveilled and periodically

interviewed for infornation (E.G., HQ 44-38861-3987). AlSO,

prison irmates and associates were queried (e.g. HQ 44-38861-

3502) as well as his military record perused (HQ 44-38861-1616) .

But, no clues developed. Ray's family said they knew nothing;

they had not heard fron nor been in contact with James and did

not know of his whereabouts (Chicago 44-1114-27). Prison

inmates and associates told talés of bounties offered for

the death of Dr. King but exhaustive investigations could not

substantiate their claims (e.g., HQ 44-38861-3767).

Frustrated, the Director prepared a memorandum for the

-59-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 243

---

## Page 244

Attorney General dated May 13, 1968 in which he explains

that extensive investigation has not resulted in any new

developments beyond Atlanta, April 5. Therefore, the

Director requested authorization for telephone and micro-

phone surveillance on Ray family members. The reguest,

however, was never acted upon (HQ 44-38861-3509) .

(7) Passport Search. From an interview with a former

cellmate of Ray's at Missouri State Prison it was learned

that Ray appreciated the ease with which a person living

in Canada could obtain a false passport (HQ 44-38861-3889) .

Though it is not clear that the cellmate's conments pre-

cipitated a search of Canadian passports issued since Ray's

April 23, 1967 escape, it is known that on the request of

the FBI Legat in Canada such a search was conducted by the

Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A passport search was also

conducted in Mexico and the United States (HQ 44-38861-4445) •

Though the search went through a staggering number

of applications and was based on the comparison of Ray's

photograph to those submitted with the application, it proved

to be the necessary break in picking up Ray's trail. At

9:30 p.M. June 1, 1968, The Legal attache, Ottawa,

Canada, called the Bureau to advise that after reviewing

some 175,000 applications the RCMP located a passport issued

-60-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 244

---

## Page 245

April 24, 1968 under the nane Ramon George Sneyd which .

contained a photograph very definitely similar to Ray

(HQ 14-38861-4190) .

The passport was filed by the Kernedy Travel

Agency in Toronto, Canada. Incident to their investi-

gation, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police contacted the

travel agency and obtained a hand printed note from Sreyd

concerning his application. The note together with the

passport photo and a latent palm print were forwarded to

the Bureau for laboratory examination which concluded that

Ray and Sneyd were the same person (HQ 44-38861-4262, 4263).

(8) Ray Apprehended. The Kernedy Travel. Agency also

provided information that Sheyd purchased a round trip air

ticket from Toronto to London departing May 6 and returning

May 21, 1968. But New Scotland Yard determined that Sneyd

turned in the return portion of the fare and received a

May 7, 1968 ticket to Lisbon, Portugal plus a $14.60 voucher

(HQ 44-38861-4319) .

Inmigration authorities in Lisbon were immediately

contacted. It was learned that Ray had entered Lisbon

May 7 but had exited for London May 17, 1968 (HQ 44-38861-

4725) .

Stops were issued by L

JEK Act 6 (4)

for Sneyd. At

11:15 a.m., June 8, 1968, Ray was apprehended by officers of

-61-

## Page 246

New Scotland Yard while he was passing through British

innigration offices in the London Airport. At the time

he was planning a flight to Brussels, Belgium (HQ 44-38861-

4616).

2. Alleged Conspiracies

Literally scores of alleged conspiracies were

communicated to the Bureau. From the date of the assas-

sination in April, 1968, even up to this date, the FBI

has been approached by numerous persons with stories

which purport to identify a conspiracy to kill King.

These stories involved the widest range of perpetrators

and participants as well as motives. To the extent

that these leads were pursued, the Bureau was put in

the rather difficult position of conducting an investi-

gation which ranged far beyond the concrete evidence

that had already been obtained. When the leads were

in fact bogus ones, the FBI was attempting to prove a

negative in each reported case. With a controversial

figure, such as Dr. King, the possibilities of conspiracy

were numerous.

Consequently, the Bureau's credibility

would necessarily be strained, given its past relation-

ship with the civil rights leader, unless each story was

disproved. Yet the Bureau attempted to cover each lead.

-62-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 246

---

## Page 247

As previously stated, each SAC was held personally

responsible for an expedited and thorough review.

Based on our review of the files, the task force

is satisfied that the FBI did a credible and thorough

job in attempting to identify any possible conspiracy

or persons who could have been involved in the murder.

In each of the allegations received, the Bureau immediately

interviewed the person who was the source of the allegation

where this was possible (i.e. where the source was not

anonymous). In situations where the complaint was not an

obvious hoax the Bureau then attempted immediately to

identify the alleged participants and interview then.

Where there was not a satisfactory explanation to dispel

the allegation concerning such matters as whereabouts or

associations, the Bureau then would check further. This

does not mean that every allegation was pursued to the

ultimate degree. Judgment based on experience dictated

many of the decisions.

These judgments were also tempered by a critical

factor. Within fifteen days after the murder, the FBI

was convinced that Galt and Ray were the same person,

that this individual purchased the rifle, rented the

room across from the Lorraine Motel, and fired the shot

that killed Dr. King. While there were many other people

-63-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 247

---

## Page 248

who were antagonistic toward Di. King and many who

had apparently discussed killing him, any successful

conspiracy would have to have involved Ray based on the

evidence at hand. In all the years following the assas-

sination, the investigation has failed to reveal any

cormection between any alleged conspirator(s) and James

Earl Ray including those alleged by Ray himself. Indeed,

the overwhelming evidence indicates that Ray was almost

totally alone during the year after his escape from the

Missouri State Prison.

We have not addressed here the Bureau's handling of

particular conspiracy leads because of the large nunber of

allegations involved. Bureau files can be checked for each

reported lead and the resulting investigation on that lead

traced to its conclusion.

C. The Story of James Earl Ray

1. Chronology of Ray's Activities On and

After April 23, 1967

On Sunday, the 23rd of April 1967, after he had

served seven years of a twenty year sentence for armed

robbery in the Missouri State Penitentiary at Jefferson

City, James Earl Ray escaped. When a truck appeared at

the prison bakery where Ray worked, a bread box was

carried onto the truck to be delivered to a nearby prison

farm. Ray had concealed himself inside the bread box,

and later fled from the prison truck at a stop prior to its

reaching the Renz prison farm. (3503; Huie, pp. 24-27.) =/

Ray allegedly headed first toward Kansas City

(Huie, p.27). On the third day he burglarized a

trailer sitting by the Missouri River taking a blanket

and food (Huie, p.27). For the next three nights he made

his way along the railroad in the direction of Kansas City

April 23, 1967

April 24-28

force has obtained xerox copies of Ray's correspondence with

Mr. Huie which reflect the admissions cited by Huie.

to a city large enough so he would not be noticed and

took a train to St. Louis. He then took a taxicab to

East. St. Louis, called a friend who drove him to Edwards-

ville whence he caught a bus for Chicago (Huie, p. 28).

On May 3rd, Ray secured work for the next eight

weeks as a dishwasher and cook's helper at the Indian

Trail Restaurant in Winnetka, Illinois, and resided at

2731 North Sheffield in Chicago under the name John L.

Rayns. He purchased a 1959 Chrysler automobile from

a private owner on June 5th for $200 (5448). On

June 9th, he failed a driver's test, but passed the

test on June 12th (5394). Ray moved from his

Sheffield address to 1648 Lumt Street on June 17th

where he paid one week's rent (5118). Ray was issued

a driver's permit in the name of John L. Rayns for the

State of Illinois on June 21st (5394). During the week

of June 19th Ray left his job, and requested that his

final paycheck be forwarded to the Lunt Street address,

which it was (5118).

Thereafter, on July 14, Ray purchased a 1962

Plymouth automobile from a commercial dealer in East

St. Louis, Illinois, and transferred the licensed

plates from the Chrysler to the Plymouth (5413; Huie,

p.39). Leaving East St. Louis on July 15, Ray proceeded

to Montreal, Canada, via Indianapolis, Detroit and

Windsor (Huie, p.40). His prime objective was

allegedly to secure a Canadian passport (idem p.41) .

As John L. Rayns, he registered for an overnight

stay at the Bourgard Motel in Dorion, just west of

Montreal (idem, p.43; 5437x).

Next, Ray first used the alias Eric S. Galt

when he signed a six month lease for an apartment

in the Harkay Apartments, 2589 Notre Dame East, in

Montreal (2192; Huie, p.43). Ray then allegedly

held up a food store stealing $1700 (Huie, p.47).

The following day he spent $300 for new clothes at the

Tip Top Tailors, 488 St. Catherine West, had his hair

cut and a manicure at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel (Huie,

p.48). He also ordered on July 21st a $75 tailoi-made

suit at the English and Scotch Woolen Company (4692) .

(A month and a half later, by a letter from Birmingham

dated September 6, 1967, this tailoring company was

instructed by Ray to send the finished garment to him

at his then Birmingham address.) Three days later Ray

ordered three sex books from Futura Books, Inc., in

Inglewood, California, (2192), and on July 28th, he

enrolled in a correspondence course at the Locksmithing

Institute, Little Falls, New Jersey (2068). Both matters

were paid by Canadian money orders.

Ray vacationed, beginning July 30th, at the

July 30-

August 5

Gray Rocks Inn on Lake Ouirmet in the Laurentian

Mountains 'seeking, according to Ray, contact with

a respectable woman to vouch for him on a passport

application. He was "picked up" by a female Canadian

Government employee and her girlfriend and spent the •

next few days with them before leaving on August 7th;

The two women followed, stayed overnight with Ray in

August 7

Montreal on August 7th, and then returned to their

residences in Ottawa (Huie, pp. 51-53; 5402). On

August 9th, he purchased by money order a formula for

making glass for a two-way mirror (2192). Then, on

August 9

August 19

August 19th, Ray visited the goverment employee in

Ottawa, but did not importune her to assist him on his

passport application (Huie, p.54).

the truth of the story, Ray left Montreal, met his

brother at Northbrooke, Illinois, gave his Plymouth

car to his brother Jerry Ryan, (5413), proceeded

from Northbrooke or Chicago to Birmingham, stayed

August 26th at the Granada Hotel, 2230 Fourth

Avenue as John L. Rayns (5400; Huie; p.61), and that

same day also took a room in the name Eric S. Galt

at the Economy Rooms, 2608 Highland Averue. (2324).

Two days later Ray, as Galt, giving the Highland

Avenue address, rented safety deposit box No. 5517

at the Main Office, Birmingham Irust National Bank

(2323; Huie, p.62). The access record on this

box shows entries at 2:32p.m. on August 28; from

1:52p.m. to 1:56p.m. on September 5; from 11:05

to 11:08a.m. on September 21; and from 10:16a.m.

to 10:19a.m. on September 28 (2323).

The purchase of a white 1966 Ford Mustang was

accomplished at the end of August by answering a

newspaper ad on the 29th of August and paying $1995 in

cash to William D. Paisley on the 30th (628). All

this checks with the car purchase chronology Ray

himself admitted to author William Bradford Huie

(Huie, pp. 61-63; Ray's self-serving attribution of

"Raoul" as the one who directed him to buy the car

and who supplied the cash is uncorroborated).

Ray as Eric Starvo Galt, applied for and was

issued Alabama driver's license No. 2848947 (4143).

The signature matches the other handwritings of the

same name (4143). At some point during his stay in

Birmingham, Ray purchased a .38 revolver which was

found on his person on his arrest in Heathrow Airport,

London, England (1422).

On September 12th, Ray enrolled for 5 weekly

dance classes at the Continental Dance Club Studios

(2324). The Modern Photographic Book Publishing

Co. Inc., of New York City received a coupon order

from Eric S. Galt for a photo book (633) and a letter

by Ray as Galt written September 26, asking that the

book not be sent as he was moving and would give the

changed address later (4143). The handwriting was

identical with Ray's (4143).

Ray purchased a bank draft from the Exchange

Security Bank, 5 points' South Branch, Birmingham

payable to the Superior Bulk Film Co. of Chicago and

this accompanied an order on that company for a Kodak

Super 8 movie camera, a projector, a splicer and a 20

later in which he acknowledged receipt of the items

he had ordered but returned the movie camera as the

wrong one; he stated he was leaving for Mexico on

October 7, and would send a new address to which

• the correct movie camera could be forwarded (4143).

On September 30th, Ray paid only for his room (2118) .

Ray, as Galt, was issued Alabama license tags

October 6

No. 1-38993 for 1968. He left Birmingham for Mexico

on Ostober 6 (Huie, p. 66). On the 8th of October,

Ray purchased a 30 day Mexican auto insurance policy

October 8

October 10

(1904). He reached Acapulco on October 10th, proceeded October 15

to Guadalajara on October 15th and left there on

the 18th for Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico,

arriving in Puerto Vallarta on the 19th (5496). He

registered in Room 212 of the Hotel Rio at Morelos 86

on this date; his "Galt"' signature and writings match

his other Calt writings (4143). Calt typed a letter

to the. film company to ask for a refund to the Puerto

Vallarta address in lieu of the Kodak movie camera

which had been mailed meanwhile to his vacated

Birmingham address (4143). Again the written signature

on this note matched the string of "Calt" signatures.

beach.) (Huie, p.81), Ray switched hotels, going

from the Rio to the Hotel Tropicana (1219). He

spent most of his time in the period from October

19 to November 13, 1967, with a girlfriend, Irma

Morales, whose true name is Manuela Aguirre Medrano

(1219), and possibly another female named Nina

(Huie, p.8).

Ray left Puerto Vallarta and drove to Los

November 14

Angeles where he rented an apartment at 1535 North

Serrano Avenue on the 19th of November. (668; Huie,

p.85). He then wrote a typed letter to the Superior

November 19

Bulk Film Company, Chicago, to forward to his new

address the refund due him for the undelivered Kodak

movie camera; the signature on this letter matches

the other "Galt"' signatures. (4143).

In this second week of his stay in Los Angeles, November 27

Ray began a series of six visits to a clinical

psychologist, Dr. Mark O. Freeman, in hopes of

Apparently, in a further self-improvement step,

Ray enrolled in a course of dancing instructions with December 5

the owner of the National Dance Studio, 2026 Pacific

on December 15th Ray, as Calt still, began a round

trip drive with Charles J. Stein, 5666 Franklin

Avenue, Los Angeles, to New Orleans in Ray's white

Mustang to pick up Stein's sister's two small children

(4143). Stein and Ray arrived in New Orleans on the

December 17

17th, the latter registering at the Provincial Hotel,

1024 Chartes Street, Room 126 (5399). The "Galt"

registration card signature matched the string of

such signatures in Ray's odyssey and he further

recorded that he was driving a Mustang with Alabama

license No.1-38993 and gave his address as 2608

Highland Avenue, Birmingham (4143) .

Charles Stein, made the return trip to Los Angeles

arriving by the 21st of December when he took the

first of the series of dancing lessons he had

signed up for. The next day he picked up his

laundry. Four more dancing lessons are recorded

next (4143).

On December 28, 1967, Ray first indicated

his interest in immigrating to Africa, and more

particula:ly to a white ruled area, by writing a

letter of inquiry to Mr. Jom Acord, Chairman,

American-Southern African Council, 800 Fourth St.,

S.W., Washington, D.C.; the signature of Galt

matched up with the other Galt writings. (4143).

Ray said he visited Las Vegas on New Year's

Day. (Huie, p.96). Dance lesson's are documented

on the 2nd and 3rd days of 1968 (2325). Calt

bought Bank of America money order No. 0799 18037

in the amount of $15 from the Hollywood Western

Branch payable to the Locksmithing Institute (2325).

The FBI lab made the usual writing match up on the

two Bank of America money orders on the 29th of January,

one to place an ad in the Free Press soliciting a

female pen pal and the second to pay for a mail

forwarding service (1500). Each transaction created

a handwriting match as did a Bank of America money order

Galt was serviced on the 13th at a Chevron Station,

1506 North Normandic Avenue, Los Angeles with mileage

at 34,185. Another undated servicing some 200 miles

later occurred at Cort Fox Ford Co., 4531 Hollywood

Boulevard in Los Angeles (2325).

Ray attempted to increase his social life by

writing and sending his photograph to a woman listed

by "The Local Swinger" which listing was secured for

$1.00; Ray in fact wrote 5 such letters (4143). The

Galt signature was added to the FBI's matchups and

Ray's photograph secured. For reading material,

Ray ordered books from Futura Books paying by money

order No. 0799 19430 on the 26th. (1500). The

Ray made a money order payment No. 0799 19701 to the

At intervals in his stay in Los Angeles, Ray

had plastic surgery done to change his appearance

(author Huie puts this treatment as on March 3, 7 and

11, 1968, Huie, pp.107-8); he visited a psychologist-

hypnotist, Reverend Von Koss on January 4, 1968

(Huie, p.102), and allegedly some seven other

psychiatrists, hypnotists or scientologists.

According to author Huie, he frequented a bar known

as the Rabbit's Foot Club and on one night became

involved in a racial argument followed by a mugging in

which he had his wallet stolen and lost his suit jacket,

car keys and driver's license (Huie, p.96-98). According

to author Huie citing Ray as his source, Ray telephoned

Alabama and had a duplicate license issued; this was

forwarded from his former Birmingham address to California

and received there about March 10, 1968 (Huie, p.98).

"Galt" was graduated fron the bartending school

on the 2nd of March. His picture was taken with the

school operator and Ray closed his eyes to make recogni-

tion more difficult (4143; Huie, p.104).

A postal money order 10.1,916,211,078 was sent

to the Locksmithing Institute as a periodic payment on

Ray listed a change of address on March 17

with the St. Francis Hotel, giving his forwarding

address as Ceneral Delivery, Main Post Office

Atlanta, Georgia (4143). Presumably he left

Los Angeles in his white Mustang on this date,

proceeding to New Orleans where he left a box

of clothing for Marie Martin's little daughter,

Marian de Grassee, at Charles Stein's cousin

Theresa Stone's residence, 4019 Royal Street (4143;

Huie, p. 108) .

From New Orleans, Ray drove to Selma, Alabama

March 22

(5502), (where Ray began to stalk De. King according

to Huie's statement of Ray's admission on this) and,

March 23

after an overnight stay there, he went on to. Montgomery, March 24

to Birmingham and finally to Atlanta, Georgia (Huie, p.

112).

In Atlanta, Ray rented room No. 2 in a rooming

house at 113-14th Street, N.E. from the operator,

Jimmy Delton Garner (1033). He stayed there until

March 28 on which day, while still in Atlanta, he

purchased U.S. Postal money order No. 5, 615,057,923 pay-

able to the Locksmithing Institute (1428). The Galt

signature was a matchup (4143).

On the 29th Ray appeared at the Aeronarine Supply

March 29

Canpany, 5701 Airport Highway in Birmingham, Alabama,

and using the alias Harvey Lownyer purchased a Remington

March 30

•243 caliber rifle, Model 700 with a 2x-7x Redfield

telescopic sight mounted on it (432). Almost certainly

because the breech of the .243 caliber weapon was caked

with a hardened preservative (cosmoline) and could not

be loaded, Ray returned it the following day (not having

fired it). He explained that his "brother" didn't like

it, and exchanged the .243 rifle for a Model 760, 30-06

caliber Remington. The scope was transferred to the

latter rifle. Throughout these transactions the package

for either rifle was a Browning shotgun carton which was

large enough to hold the scope-equipped Remingtons (432).

The Atlanta rooming house operator, Jimmy Delton

March 31

Garner stated he had Ray print his name (Eric S. Galt) on

an old envelope at Garner's request so that Garner could

transfer the name properly to his official records; the

handprinting is a matchup with other Galt-Ray printing

samples (1033).

Using the name Eric Cale, Ray leit his laundry

and dry cleaning at the Piedmont Laundry pickup

station, 1168 Peachtree, N.W. in Atlanta (4143). Two

days later, as Eric S. Galt, Ray on April 3 registered

into Room 34 at the Rebel Motor Hotel, 3466 Lamar

Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee (the distance between Atlanta

and Memphis by the most convenient route is 398 miles);

he gave 2608 Highland Avenue, Birmingham as his address

and he noted on the registration card that he was driving

a Mustang with Alabama license No. 1-38993 (4143). His

signature was a match to the other identified Galt signa-

tures (4143). On this same day, Ray purchased a safety

razor and shaving supplies at the Rexall Drug Store in

the Whitehaven suburb of Memphis (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A-

Sec. 1; Huie, p.129).

Ray left the Rebel Motel before the 1p.m.

checkout time on April 4th (4143). At some point

between 3p.m. and 3:30p.m. on the 4th, a man

generally answering Ray's description rented Room 5-B.

at: 422 1/2 South Main Street, Memphis, in the name of

John Willard (idem. 33). Ray admits to having been in

the room with "Raoul" whom he first said rented the

room using the 'Willard" alias he, Ray, supplied (Huie,

p.115). In another letter to Huie, Ray states he himself

rented the room using the alias John Willard (Huie, P.

30). Ray went out to the York Aums Company Store then

located at 162 South Main Street and purchased a pair

of Businell binoculars for a total of $41.55 (4143);

Ray was identified by the salesman at York Arms and

Ray acmits to having been to the sports store and to

having made the purchase of the binoculars (Huie, P.

115). By Sp.m. at the latest, Ray had returned to

the rooming house, parked his Mustang and had taken

his zipper bag and bedspread to Room 5-B (Huie, p.115);

by necessary inference, because it was adnittedly

brought down from there. and dropped on the sidewalk,

the 30-06 rifle had been taken up to Room 5-B at this

time or just before Ray's trip to the York Arms Co.

Store (See Huie, p.114 and p.131; 4143) .

As detailed in the discussion of the course of

the FBI investigation ante at pp. 48-50, the assassin fled

from the common bathroom at the rear of the rooming

house after firing the shot that killed Dr. King. The

assassin could have cleared and undoubtedly did clear

the corridor and the stairs to the street in about 45

seconds. In another 15 seconds at the outside he could

have reached and undoubtedly did reach Ray's white

Ray to then Special Agent in Charge of the Memphis Field

Office, Robert Jensen, roomer Charles Stephens had a

good look at Ray in the rooming house (5622; Interview.of

Robert Jensen, July 7, 1976, App. B).

• On the street Guy Warren Canipe, Jr., in his place

of business, Canipe Amusement Co., at 424 South Main Street

heard a thud near the front door of his store, looked up

to see a white male walk rapidly past his store going

south (right to left to someone inside the store) and,

with the two customers in his store, went to the front

door where they observed a small white car, a Mustang

according to the two customers, pull away going north

in California and a copy of the Free Press from LOs

while he fled to Canada (Huie, P.133). Ray picked up .

his laundry at the Piedmont Laundry pick-up station at

He then took a bus departing Atlanta just after noon on

the 5th and arrived in Cincinnati at about 1:30a.m. on

the 6th of April. After a one hour layover which he

stated he spent in a tavern near the bus depot, Ray

continued by bus to Detroit where he arrived at about

arriving in Windsor an hour or so before noon and

proceeded from there to Toronto by train arriving at

about 5:00p.m. (Huie, p.135). He rented a room at

102 Ossington Avenue without giving his name (5502;

Huie, p. 135) .

application for a duplicate bizen certificate in each of

these names on April 10 and on the following day had

a passport picture taken in the name of Bridgman and

then to provide a separate mailing address for the

expected replies as to Sneyd, he rented a room at

962 Dundas Street in the name of Sneyd on April 16th

(5502; Huie, p.141). On the same day he executed an

application in the name Paul Bridgman with his, Ray's

102 Ossington Avenue address as the person to be

notified in case of emergency (Huie, p.143). The

Kennedy Iravel Agency of Toronto handled the processing

of the application for Ray (5502). On the 19th Ray

moved to the Dundas Street address (5502).

The fingerprints of "Eric S. Galt"' were found to

be a match with those of James Earl Ray after a search

of the print file on Fugitive Felons.

According to author Huie he gleaned from Ray that:

Ray visited four bars on the list in order to watch the

IV show "The FBI" (Huie, p.147). He found the show tuned

in at the fourth place he tried and learried that he had

made the Ten Most Wanted List with an international "look-

out'as to Ray (Huie, p.147). He checked out of the

Ossington Avenue room on the 19th (Huie, p:147).

On April 24 the Canadian passport in the name of

Ramon George Sneya was issued to Ray (Huie, p.148). Ray

purchased a round trip ticket to London and departed

on May 6, 1968 (Huie, p.149). Fram London Ray took a

plane to Lisbon where he spent. 10 days looking for a

passage to Angola (Huie, p.150). When he was unable.

to do so he returned to London after first getting his

passport replaced at the Canadian Embassy in Lisbon to

correct the spelling of the name Sneyd (instead of Sneya)

(5502; Huie, p. 150) .

Ray returned to London and spent his time trying

to find a way to join a mercenary force (Huie, p.150).

To this end he bought a plane ticket to Brussels and was

in the process of meeting his plane at the Heathrow Airport

when he was apprehended on June 8, 1968, by detectives from

JFK Act 6 (4)

(4346,4368; Huie, p.150-151). The arrest

was made on the basis of use of a fradulent passport and

carrying a concealed weapon, i.e., the loaded .38 caliber

Japanese-make revolver found on his person at Heathrow

(4346, 4368; Huie, p. 151).:

reports and Ray's letters to author Willian Bradford Huie.

himself. Accordingly, after the United States Supreme

Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari, on

December 13, 1976, a verbal request was made to Ray's

Attorney, James H. Lesar, for an opportunity to interview

Ray. Lesar stated that he was writing Ray a letter that

day and would advise him of our desire to interview him

and leave the matter up to him (Interview of James H.

Lesar, December 14, 1976, App. B). Also, the task force

sent Ray a letter on December 15, 1976, via his attorney

requesting an interview (See letter to James Earl Ray,

December 15, 1976, App. A, Ex. 14). While no answer to

our letter was received, Ray sent the task force a copy of

a letter addressed to his attorney. Ray attached a copy

of a complaint he recently filed in a civil action and

stated in the letter to his attorney that: "I agree with

your advice opposing the interview. It would appear that

this would only be in the interest of the J.D. and their

book writing collaborators, e.g., Gerold Frank, George

McMillian, et ál." (See letter to James H. Lesar, December 20,

1976, App. A, Ex.15).

Absent a statement to us fron Ray, four existing Ray

explanations were compared and are here briefly noted.

Firsi, no one, other than his attorneys talked wish

Ray before the plea bargaining resulted in his conviction

of the First Degree murder of Martin Luther King, JI., and

sentencing in open court on March 10, 1969, before Judge

W. Preston Battle, Criminal Court of Shelby County,

Tennessee (See Transcript App. A, Ex.16). At that. time,

on voir dire, Judge Battle asked Ray: "Are you pleading

guilty to Murder in the First Degree in this case because

you killed Dr. Martin Luther King under such circumstances

that would make you legally guilty of Murder in the First

Degree under the law as explained to you by your lawyers?"

Ray answered: 'Yes."

Ray then acknowledged that he was pleading guilty

freely, voluntarily and understandingly. He and his

attorney, Percy Foreman, initialed the copy of these

questions and answers. Ray also signed a detailed

stipulation confessing that he fired the fatal shot (5506).

The task force observes that the only way one can

be "legally guilty" of first degree murder is when one

accomplishes, or aids of assists in the accomplishment, of

the wrongful killing of a human being with premeditation

and malice aforethought. Thus, Ray has judicially confessed

that he intended to and did kill Dr. King.

Second, Ray reiated in writing to author Huie a

story of his odyssey from Missouri State Prison to Memphis

which acknowledged that he bought the murder weapon, made

his way to Memphis, rented the room there at 422 South

Main on April 4, 1968, using the alias "John Willard,"

waited in the white Mustang, and drove "Raoul" away from

the crime scene after the murder wholly unaware of the

killing of Dr. King. In this version "Raoul", or "Roual",

is the mysterious killer whom Ray thought to be an

international gun-runner; Ray bought the murder weapon for

"Raoul" thinking it was to be displayed to prospective

Mexican buyers in Room 5-B of the "flop house" on South

Main Street (quie, p.130-131).

Third, in a statement read on a program of Station

KMOX-IV St. Louis, Missouri, in August of 1959 by his

brother Jerry, James Earl: Ray was quoted as alleging that

he was the irocent victim, "the fall guy" of a scheme by

the FBI (Memphis 44-1987 Sub M-665). This description of

the crime contains no reference to Raoul.

Fourth, the most recent story available to the

task force is reported as the result of a four hour interview

by Wayne Chastain, Jr., for the Pacific News Service,

October 20, 1974. It is to the effect that Ray was "set up

-88-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 272

---

## Page 273

as a patsy' for "Raoul." It proceeds along the same lines

as the tale told by Ray to author Huie that there was to

be a meeting at the rooming house at 6p.m. with an

international gun runner. Ray was instructed by Raoul to

have the white Mustang at the curb for "Raoul's" use that

evening. Ray, however, drove away from the area at about

6:00p.m. to get air in a low tire and found police swarming

all over the place when he tried to return at 7:05p.m. He

could not park, was turned back by police and learned only

after driving 100 miles into Mississippi that he had been

associated with the men who killed DI: King (The Assassinations,

Dallas and Beyond, Edited by Peter Dale Scott, Paul L. Hock

and Russell Stetler, Random House, 1976, pp.315-317).

The task force views the exculpatory content of these

varying and patently self-serving tales to be unbelievable.

The varying details are materially self-refuting. Ray first

adits full guilt. He then says he waited innocently at the

cuib and took off after the shot with "Raoul"' as a passenger.

He next says he was the catspaw of the FBI. And finally,

he and the Mustang were nöt in the area when the shot was

fired and he never saw "Raoul"' after the event.

The eye witnesses to the "get away"', saw only one

man who resembled Ray. The man left in a hurry in a white

Mustang as Ray adnitted doing in version niber two. We

concluded Ray was lying about the existence of a "Raoul" :

-89-

Ray's stipulated judicial confession comports in

detail with the facts disclosed by the investigation and

the failure of the self-serving stories persuasively

undermines the likelihood of any conspiracy.

2. Motive

James Earl Ray, bom 1928, was raised under

difficult circumstances. His parents were pool:, unedu

cated and generally resided in areas surrounded by

criminal activity. Ray did not achieve a high school

education, nor did he attend any vocational institution

After enlisting in the army in 1946, Ray did not meet the

military's standards and was discharged in 1948 for lack .

of adaptability. (HQ 44-38861-3333, 3987) .

Thus, at the age of twenty-one, he had a very limited

education, was not trained or skilled at any particular job,

and was a reject of the military establishment. Thereafter,

he proceeded to participate in and be apprehended for a

number of criminal actions for which he would be incarcerated

for fourteen of the next eighteen years until his escape from

the Missouri State Penitentiary in April 1967. Ray's criminal

activities included robbery, forgery and burglary (HQ 44-38861-

4143). He was not known to have been involved in crimes where

victims or witnesses were physically harmed.

*FBI files disclosed that James Earl Ray has an IQ of 105

(HQ 44-38861-3503).

-91-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 275

## Page 276

In March 1968, James Earl Ray was forty years

old and was never known to have had a serious relation-

ship with a man or woman during his adult life. Although

he was about to commit a very infamous crime of assassina-

tion, neither his childhood, his military years nor his

adult life of crime and imprisonment signaled such action.

His criminal activities were not those of a hired or self-

accomplished premeditated murderer. Why then would James

Earl Ray murder Dr. Martin Luther King, JI.?

An analysis of Ray's prison records and interviews

with his prison irmates reveals some probative facts with

respect to a motive. For example, in 1955 Ray was incar-

cerated in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas,

for forgery of post office money orders. On September 12,

1957, Ray was approved for the honor farm at Leavenworth,

but was never transferred there because he refused to Live

in the integrated dormitory at the farm (HQ 44-38861-1678)

Thus, he was supposedly willing to sacrifice this benefit

and its accompanying privileges to avoid association with

black prisoners.

An inmate with Ray at Missouri State Penitentiary

for approximately three years, stated that Ray hated

Negroes. He further stated that Ray had said that

all the Negro prisoners inside the penitentiary should

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 276

-92-

---

## Page 277

be killed. He also responded that on several occasions

Ray had said he would kill Dr. Martin Luther King, JI.,

if the price were right. In 1966, there was a riot at

the penitentiary. Three blacks were killed. The inmate

would not state whether Ray had participated in the

killings. He did say that, if Ray had not, 'he would

definitely know who had killed the prisoners. He also

said that he would not be surprised if he acted without.

being paid for the killing. It should be noted that another

prisoner who was a chef at MSP and Ray's boss for six years,

stated that this inmate was a good friend of Ray and he also

hated Negroes. (HQ 44-38861-4443) •

A second inmate with Ray at the Missouri State

Penitentiary from 1960 until 1965, claimed that he

recalls that Ray was glad when President Kennedy was killed

and stated "that is one nigger-loving S.O.B that got shot".

The prisoner also advised that Ray disliked Negroes. During

the time period when King was leading demonstrations and

marches Ray would become aggravated and upset when reading

this information in newspapers to the point that he would

curse King and the Negroes. He further stated he had heard

prison rumors that Ray was supposed to have killed three

black prisoners at the penitentiary. Finally, he related

-93-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802

Page 277

---

## Page 278

that in 1963 Ray mace the remaris that he was going to

get Martin Iuther King when he got out of prison.

(HQ 44-38861-2678, 2791) •

A third inmate at MSP from 1962 until 1965,

described Ray as a "lone wolf" who never trusted

anyone. He stated that Ray was a racist and was heard

many times discussing his dislike of Negroes. Another

prisoner became acquainted with Ray in 1965 and said that

Ray carmented if he ever got out of jail he was going to

make himself a "bunch of money," and Ray further said a

"Businessmen's Association" had offered $100,000 for

killing Martin Luther King. This prisoner said that

Ray did not know what the "Businessmen's Association"

was, but he intended to find out. (HQ 44-38861-4143)

A cellmate with Ray in 1955 at Kansas City who

later served prison time with Ray at Leavenworth, Kansas,

was also incarcerated with Ray at MSP. He stated that

during the period when President Kennedy was assassinated

the movements of DI. Martin Luther King became the topic

of conversation at the penitentiary. Many prisoners heard

that businessmen had raised a considerable amount of money,

about one million dollars, as a bounty on King's head. He

further stated that Ray mentioned a dozen times that had he

known about the bounty on John F. Kennedy's head and

had he been free he would have collected it; and, if he

-94-

WW 55220 DocId:32989802 Page 278

---

## Page 279

got out in time and King were still alive, he would get

the bounty on King (EQ 44-38861-4143). A prisoner

who was at MSP from 1958 through 1965 stated Ray did

not like ivegroes and was capable of killing DI. Martin.

Luther King, JI. (HQ 44-38861-4143) .

Ray's psychological background is also a very

important avenue of review. As a result of a voluntary

psychiatric examination in 1966, Ray was described as

having a sociopathic personality, antisocial type with

anxiety and depressive features (HQ 44-38861-3505). In

1954, a prison sociologist stated that Ray's delinquencies

seem due to impulsive behavior, especially when drinking

(HQ 44-38861-3335). These characteristics and carments

about Ray support the opinion of psychologist Dr. Mark

Freeman. While Ray was in Los Angeles he was a patient

of Dr. Freeman. Dr. Freeman believes that Ray was potentially

capable of assassination, was a self-motivated person who

could act alone, and likely fantasized on being someone

important.

There were two matters involving Ray and blacks

while outside prison which shed some light on whether his

hatred of blacks and need for importance and profit could

have motivated him to murder. While in Mexico in the fall

-95-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 279

---

## Page 280

Of 1967, Ray associated with

= Mexican voman, Inma

Morales, in the City of Puerto Vallarta. Morales admitted

spending considerable time with him and recalls an incident

that took place on Sunday, October 29th. She and Ray were

seated at a table in a bar and were drinking when four

blacks and several white persons arrived and were seated

at another table. She stated that Ray kept goading the

blacks for some reason. Thereafter, Ray left his table

to go to his car, and when he retumed he asked her to

feel his pocket. Morales did and felt a pistol in his

pocket. Ray stated to Morales that he wanted to kill the

blacks. He then continued to be insulting and when the

blacks left he stated he wanted to go after them. Morales,

however, told him it was time for the police to arrive to

check the establishment and Ray stated he wanted nothing to

do with the police, thereby terminating the incident (HQ'44-

38861-2073) •

A second incident took place during Ray's stay in

Los Angeles. James E. Morrison, a bartender at the Rabbit's

Foot Club there, identified Ray as a frequent customer.

Morrison said that on one occasion Ray became engaged in a

political discussion with him regarding Robert Kennedy and

George Wallace. Ray became rather incensed and vehemently

supported wallace. On another occasion, Ray had had a

-96-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 280

---

## Page 281

:

discussion with Pat Goodsell, a freguent fenale customer,

concerning blacks and the civil rights movement. Ray became

very involved and began dragging Goodsell towards the door

saying, "I'Il drop you off in Watts and we'll see how you

like it there" (HQ 44-38861-3557). Ray then supposedly went

outside and had to fight two persons, one being black (Huie,

pp. 96-98) .

Thus, it seems clear that Ray openly displayed a

strong racist attitude towards blacks. While in prison,

Ray stated he would kill Dr. King if given the opportunity

and Ray was prepared to threaten or attack black persons

in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, with a weapon for apparently

a racial reason. These events and occurrences leading to

the assassination of Dr. King and the assassination itself

certainly do not illustrate a single, conclusive motive.

Yet, Ray's apparent hatred for the civil rights movement,

his possible yearning for recognition, and a desire for a

potential quick profit may have, as a whole, provided

sufficient impetus for him to act, and to act alone.

3. Sources Of Funds

Shortly after the search for Ray began, it was

recognized that he had traveled extensively following his

escape from the Missouri Penitentiary. Moreover, in addition

-97-

NW 55220 DocId:32989802 Page 281

---

## Page 282

to normal living expenses, Ray sad nade several sub-

stantial purchases, e.g., cars, photo equipment, dance

lessons (See, List of known expenditures, App. A, Ex. 4).

These expenditures suggested that he had financial assist-

ance and hence possible co-conspirators. Therefore, the

Bureau was particularly interested in deterining his

sources of income. On April 23, 1968, the Director advised

all field divisions to consider Ray as a suspect in any

unsolved bank robberies, burglaries or armed robberies

occurring after April 23, 1967. The results were negative.

On April 29, 1968, the Director in a teletype to

all SAC's ordered that all law enforcement agencies which

maintained unidentified latent fingerprints be contacted

and requested that fingerprints of Ray be compared in order

to determine his past whereabouts and possibly establish

his source of funds. Again, negative results were obtained.

The Director, on May 14, 1968, reminded all field divisions

that Ray had spent 'à considerable amount of money from April

23, 1967 until April 4, 1968, and advised that a source for

these monies had not been determined. The Director ordered

that photographs of Ray be displayed to appropriate witnesses

in unsolved bank robberies and bank burglaries. These efforts

and all others to date, with one exception, have proved

fruitless.

-98-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 282

---

## Page 283

As a result of one of Huie's Look articles, the :

Bureau did ascertain that Ray had been employed at a

restaurant in Wirnetka, Illinois, for approximately eight

weeks. As a dishwasher and cook's helper, Ray had received

checks totaling $664 from May 7, 1967 through June 25, 1967

(See, List of known income, App. A, Ex. 5). This is the

only known source of income for Ray following his prison

escape. Reports from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police

indicated no known robberies or burgläries which could be

cormected with Ray, nor did Mexican authorities notify

the Bureau of any criminal activity which could be associ-

ated with Ray. The Bureau investigated the possibility

that Ray participated in a bank robbery at Alton, Illinois,

in 1967, but it was established that he was not a partici-

pant.

Ray related to author Huie that he robbed a food

store in Canada, and that an individual named "Raoul"

furnished him funds on a continuous basis for various

undertakings. These matters were actively pursued by the

Bureau but have never been corroborated by them.

Nor have

they been corcoborated by private inquiries of writers and

joumalists. It is the Bureau's opinion that Ray most likely

connitted on a periodic basis several robberies or burglaries

during this period in order to support himself. Ray's criminal

-99-

NW 55220

## Page 284

background does lend credence to this theory.

The task force interviewed Ray's brother, Jersy

Ray (See, Interview of Jerry Ray, December 20, 1976, App.

B). He stated that to his knowledge family members did

not provide James with any funds. Jerry admitted he met

with his brother two or three times during his employment

at the Wirnetka restaurant and advised that he, not James,

paid for their eating and drinking expenses. However,

when Jerry again saw his brother on his return from Canada

in August, 1967, James did have some money because it was

he who paid for their expenses which included a motel room.

Jerry added that James also gave him his car commenting

that he would purchase a more expensive car in Alabama.

Jerry stated he was unaware of where his brother had

obtained his money as well as the amount of money he had

at this time.

Accordingly, the sources for Ray's funds still

remain a mystery today.

4. Family Contacts and Assistance

Our review of the files indicated that the FBI

had no hard evidence linking James Ray to any conspiracy

to kill DI. King. Absent such evidence, the Bureau

apparently discounted the significance of any contact

between Ray and his family. As the Chicago case agent

told us, it is not unusual for a fugitive or a person

who has committed a given crime to be in touch with

fanily menbers. While such contact may render the actions

of the family menber criminally liable, it is not generally

pursued absent some evidence of direct participation in the

crime.

However, in light of the fact that a good deal

of mystery still surrounds James Ray and the assassination,

particularly the means by which he financed his life style

and travels, we concluded that on the basis of the infor-

mation which was uncovered, the Bureau should have pursued

this line of the investigation more thoroughly.

The cornection of the Ray family to the crime against

DI. King may have been nonexistent. This does not alter the

fact, however, that the FBI discovered that the subject of

the largest manhunt in history had been aided in his fugitive

status by at least one family member. This and other facts

suggestive of family assistance became clear as the Bureau's

investigation progressed.

-101-

NW 55220-DoeEd:32989802 Page 285

## Page 286

First, John and very Ray had significant contacts

with James while he was in Missouri State Penitentiary

(MSP) at Jefferson City, Missouri. Jerry Ray visited

James three or four times and had borrowed money from

James on at least one occasion during his confinement

(Chicago 44-1144 Sub G-17). John Ray visited or attempted

to visit James Ray while at MSP on at least nine occasions.

The last visit took place on April 22, 1967, the day before

Ray escaped (HQ 44-338861-4503) • The Bureau also discovered.

that while in prison at MSP James Ray had a fellow inmate

send a money order to a fictitious opany (Albert J. Pepper

Stationary Co.) in St. Louis, Missouri. The money was sent

to the address of Carol Pepper (sister and business partner

of John Ray) where she resided with her husband Albert.

James Ray had told the inmate who sent the money that it was

a way of getting money out of the prison (HQ 44-38861-2614) •

Second, James Earl Ray was seen by several people in

both the St. Louis and Chicago areas during the period

inmediately after his escape. In St. Louis (where John

Ray was living) two former inmates at MSP, stated that they

had seen James Ray on separate occasions. One stated that

he had seen Ray three times between May 10 and 17, 1967 (Kansas

City, 44-760-786). The other saw Ray entering a bank with

Jinnie Owens and spoke briefly with Ray as they entered

-102-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 286

---

## Page 287

(HQ 44-38861-3483). In the Chicago area where Jerry Ray

was living, the Bureau discovered that James Ray had

purchased a car on June 5, 1967 (Chicago, 44-1114 Sub D

Ex. 85) and had worked in Winnetka, Illinois. Ray's

employers also told Bureau agents that James Ray had

received several calls. fran a man claiming to be Ray's

brother immediately prior to James' departure from his

job. They stated that these calls had a visibly disturbing

effect on James Ray (Chicago 44-1114 Sub G-37). Jerry

Raynes, father of the Ray brothers, told the FBI that he

overheard John and Jerry mintion that James had been in

Chicago during the sumner of 1967 (Chicago 44-1114-508).

Third, in Califomia, the FBI discovered two facts

which pointed toward possible contact between James Ray

and his brothers. Richard Gonzales who was a fellow

student with Ray at the bartending school in Los Angeles

told Bureau agents that Ray had told him upon completion

of the course that he (Ray) was going to visit a brother

in Birminghan for two weeks (HQ 44-38861-1233). The FBI

also interviewed Marie Martin, cousin of Charles Stein.

She stated that for some time before March 17, 1968, (the

date when Ray left Los Angeles) James Ray had been stating

that he was in need of funds and was waiting for his brother

to send him some money.

-103-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 287

---

## Page 288

Fourth, through an informant the Bureau discovered

that Jerry Ray may not have been entirely candid with the

special agents during his several interviews. The informant

disclosed to Bureau agents on June 7, 1968, that Jerry Ray

stated he had seen his brother (James) at least once at a

pre-arranged meeting place in St. Louis shortly after his

escape. Jerry also allegedly stated to the informant that

he had recognized the photograph of Eric Starvo Galt as

being identical with his brother James prior to the time

the FBI had first contacted him in connection with the

assassination. He did not want to tell the FBI everything

he knew out of fear that James would be caught. (HQ 44-38861-

4594.)

Correspondence recovered by the Bureau indicated

that Jerry may have heard from James in Canada in June of

1968 (HQ 44-38861-4517 and 4518). James Ray was in Canada

during April and May of 1968 prior to his departure for

London on May 7, 1968. (HQ 44-38861-4595). It is also noted

that Jerry had earlier told agents that he had reœived mail

from James, while James was in prison, at Post Office Box 22

-104-

NW 55220 Docid: 32989802 Page 288

---

## Page 289

Wheeling, Illinois (Chicago 41-111 Suo G-26).

Finally, in November, 1968 it became clear that

James Ray had been in touch with his brother Jerry. Illinois

motor vehicle records showed that on August 25, 1967 James

Ray (using the name of John I. Rayns) transferred his 1962

Plymouth to Jerry (HQ 44-38861-5413). This was during the

period when James Ray was making his way fram Canada to

Birmingham, Alabana. It has continued to be a mystery

as to why Ray went to Alabama, how he traveled there, and

where he obtained the several thousand dollars he had when

he arrived.

Thus, at least one family member, Jerry, had lied

to the FBI and had become subject to federal criminal charges

for aiding a fugitive. He was never confronted with these

facts by the Bureau. In the task force interview of Jerry

Ray, he confirmed the fact that he had lied to the Bureau and

had seen his brother James on several occasions.I/ Jerry

denied knowing anything about James' travels or his source

of funds (Interview of Jerry Ray, December 20, 1976, App. B).

However, the task force found the credibility of Jerry's

*/ The task force attemoted to talk to James and John Ray

but an interview was refused in both instances.

denials to be suspect. In light of this low credibility

and critical passage of time which has allowed the statute

of limitations to run, we concluded that the FBI abandoned

a significant opportunity to obtain answers fron family.

members concerning some of the important questions about

James Earl Ray which still remain.

D. Critical Evaluation Of The Assassination Investigation

As this report reflects, there was a wealth of

information in the files developed by the FBI murder

investigation. We have been able to dig up some additional

data. Only a small part of any of this information has

been made a matter of any official public record. Some of

it was embodied in the stipulation agreed to by James Earl

Ray and judicially acknowledged in open court by him (with

a stated reservation as to agreeing to the wording indicating

a lack of a conspiracy). Some emerged in Ray's post-conviction

efforts to get a new trial. A quantity of the "official"

evidentiary data and a great deal of mis-information was

gleaned by the news media and by professional writers. It

is understandable therefore that many suspicions have been

generated and, because of Justice Department rules against

disclosures of raw investigative files, have gone unansvered.

First, the task force has concluded that the investi-

gation by the FBI to ascertain and capture the murderer of

-106-

NW 55220

## Page 291

Ds. Martin Luther King, Jr., was thoroughly, honestly

and successfully conducted. We submit that the minute

details compacted in this report amply support this con-

clusion.

--

At the very outset of the investigation telegrams

went to all field offices of the Bureau instructing the

Special Agents in Charge to take personal supervision of

the investigation, to check out all leads in 24 hours,

and

noting that they would be held personally responsible.

(HQ 44-38861-153). The files we reviewed show that this

directive was conscientiously followed. The Bureau sought

first to identify and locate the murderer using the obvious

leads. They checked out aliases, tracked the traces left

under the Galt alias, and used the known fingerprints from

the murder weapon and the contents of the blue zipper bag

left on South Main Street to eliminate suspects. This

backtracking ended in Atlanta. At this point the Bureau

initiated a check of the crime site fingerprints against.

the white male "wanted fugitive" print file. This produced

the almost "instant" discovery that the wanted man, Galt,

was James Earl Ray, an escapee from Missouri State Prison.

In fact the "instant"' discovery was a tedious hand search

started in a file of sone 20,000 prints. That it took only

two hours to make a match is said by the Bureau experts to

be largely shee- luck; it couid have taken days. we

accept the explanation that the fingerprint search was a

normal next resort after nomal lead procedures were

exhausted.

Second, the task force views the evidence pointing

to the guilt of James Earl Ray as the man who purchased

the murder gun and who fired the fatal shot to be conclusive.

It was possible for the task force to create a well

documented history of James Earl Ray from the moment of

his escape to his capture in England, using the investigation

reports in the FBI files and to corroborate and fill in

essertial details with Ray's own statements (admissions)

in his letters to author William Bradford Huie. From this

chronology, from the laboratory proof, and fran Ray's

judicial admissions it was concluded that he was the assassin,

and that he acted alone. We saw no credible evidence pro-

bative of the possibility that Ray and any co-conspirator

were together at the scene of the assassination. Ray's

assertions that someone else pulled the trigger are so

patently self-serving and so varied as to be wholly unbeliev-

able. They become, in fact, a part of the evidence of his

guilt by self-refutation.

Third, we found that conspiracy leads (aliunde Ray's

versions) had been conscientiously run down by the FBI even.

though they had no possible relation to Ray's stories

or to the known facts. The results were negative.

We found no evidence of any complicity on the part

of the Memphis Police Department or of the FBI.

We acknowledge that proof of the negative, i.e.,

proof that others were not involved, is here as elusive

and difficult as it has universally been in criminal law.

But the sun of all of the evidence of Ray's guilt points

to him so exclusively that it most effectively makes the

point that no one else was involved. Of course, someone

could conceivably have provided him with logistics, or

even paid him to commit the crime. However, we have

found no competent evidence upon which to base such a

theory.

Fourth, it is true that the task force unearthed

some new data - data which answers some persistent questions

and which the FBI did not seek. But the Bureau concentrated

on the principal in the case and much was not considered

important to his discovery and apprehension. We find no

dishonesty in this. A lead suggesting that one or both

of James Earl Ray's brothers were in contact with him after,

and in aid of, his escape in 1967 fron the Missouri State

Prison, and before the murder of Dr. King, was not followed.

It was not nearthed until after Ray's capture in England

on June 8, 1968; it was then apparently deemed a lead made

-109-

sterile by supervening events. By hindsight the task

force believes Jerry and John Ray could have been

effectively interrogated further to learn their knowledge,

if any, of James Earl Ray's plans, his finances and whether

they helped him after King's death.

Finally, the task force observed instances of FBI

headquarter's reluctance to provide the Civil Rights

Division and the Attorney General with timely reports on

the course of the murder investigation. For examole,

early in the investigation in a reaction to a press report

of Attorney General Clark's expectation of making a progress

report to the nation, FBI Director Hoover wrote: "We are

not going to make any progress reports" (HQ 44-38861-1061).

The Bureau files reflect a significant degree of

disdain for the supervisory responsibilities of the Attorney

Ceneral and the operating Divisions of the Department. For

example, the Attorney General authorized the institution of

prosecutive action against the suspect "Galt" (Birmingham

44-1740-1005). But then, apparently without further consul-

tation with the Attorney General or the Civil Rights

Division; the Bureau prepared and filed a criminal complaint.

The Bureau selected Birmingham as the venue in which to

file the complaint in preference to Memphis because the

Bureau ''could not rely. on the U.S. Attorney at Memphis"

-110-

DocId: 32989802 Page 294

## Page 295

and 'would lose control of the situation"' (HO 44-38861-1555).

The Bureau scenario called for then advising the Attorney

• General "that circumstances have required the action taken"

(HQ 44-38861-1555) •

We submit that in this sensitive case the Departmental

officials in Washington should have been consulted.

As another example, at the extradition stage of the

case, marked discourtesy was exhibited to the Attorney

General and to Assistant Attorney General Fred Vinson. In

a telephone discussion with the Attorney General who

complained of being 'kept in the dark"', an Assistant to

the Director accused the Attorney General of falsifications

and "hung up the phone". Again, when Assistant Attorney

General Vinson was detailed to England to arrange for the

extradition of James Earl Ray, the Legal Attache was ordered

to be "diplomatic but firm with Vinson and that under no

circumstances should Vinson be allowed to push our personnel

around'' (HQ 44-38861-4447).

The task force views this lack of coordination and

cooperation as highly improper. The Attorney General and

the Division of the Department having prosecutorial

responsibility for an offense being investigated should be

kept fully abreast of developments.

The responsible

-111-

## Page 296

Division, moreover, should have sufficient control of the

Bureau's investigations to insure that the legal necessities

of pleading and proof are met.

In fairness to the Bureau it has to be observed

that it is the obligation of. the Department to insist on

these perogatives. We do not think it effectively did so

in the King murder case.

III. THE SECURITY INVESTIGATION

A. FBI Surveillance And Harassment Of DI. King

1. Initiation of Technical Surveillance and

COINTELPRO Type Activities

In order to reconstruct the actions taken by

members of the FBI toward Dr. King, the task force

scrutinized the basis for the initiation by the Bureau

of any action with respect to Dr. King. During the review

it was revealed that on May 22, 1961, Mr. Alex Rosen, then

Assistant Director of the General Investigative Division

(Division 6), advised Director Hoover in an information

memorandum, per his request on Di. King and four other

individuals in comection with the "Freedom Riders,"

that "King has not been investigated by the FBI"' (Memo

from Scatterday to Rosen, May 22, 1961, App. A, Ex. 7).

The menorandum contained few references on Dr. King. The

Director commented, with regard to the omission of a subject

matter investigation on Dr. King: "Why not?" The substance

of the report was forwarded to Attorney General Kennedy, and

the FBI did not pursue the King matter at this time. Thus,

FBI persornel did not have nor did they assume a personal

interest in the activities of Dr. King through May, 1961.

Furthermore, in 1961, information in the Bureau files on

-113-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 297

---

## Page 298

De. King had only been gleaned from sporadic reports.

and this particular report to the Director was provided

by Division 6 which had responsibility for civil rights

matters.

In the beginning of 1962, the FBI started and

rapidly continued to gravitate toward Dr. King. The

sequence of events has already been reported in some

detail by the Senate Select Cormittee as well as in the

Robert Murphy Report which you received in March, 1976.

The task force in its review of pertinent documents con-

fims these reports.

In essence, the Director communicated to Attorney

General Kernedy during 1962 and 1963 a host öf memoranda

concerning the interest of the Comnist Party in the

civil rights movement, and, in particular, DI. King's

relationship with two frequently consulted advisors whom

the FBI had tabbed as members of the Coumnist Party. As

a result of the deep interest in civil rights affairs by the

Attorney General and by the Kennedy Administration, these FBI

reports had the effect of alarming Robert Kernedy and affecting

his decisions on the national level.

The net effect of the Bureau memoranda nearly

culminated in the summer of 1963 when Attorney General

-114-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 298

---

## Page 299

Kennedy suggested consideration of technical surveillance

on King and the SCLC (HQ 100-106670-3631). Previously,

the bulk of FBI intelligence on DI. King was secured by

technical surveillance of one of his advisors and from

informants close to his associates. However, when Attorney

General Kennedy was confronted shortly thereafter with the

Director's request for such surveillances, he reconsidered

his suggestion and denied the request (HQ 100-106670-165,

171). Attorney General Kennedy as well as several other

Department officials were sincerely concerned with King's

association with alleged commmist members since proposed

civil rights legislation was then very vulnerable to the

attack that commists were influencing the direction of the

civil rights movement. Yet, an affirmative program to

gather intelligence with King as the subject was still

considered ill-advised. However, a significant turn of

events within the circles of the FBI hierarchy would soon

reverse the Attorney General's decision, and without his

knowledge the FBI would also launch an illegal counter-

intelligence program directed to discredit and neutralize

the civil rights leader.

Director Hoover's demeanor toward Dr. King has been

well publicized and is summarized below. Certainly, as

the task force determined, this played a vital role in

-115-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 299

---

## Page 300

FBI affairs, as did the Director's attitude toward the

Communist Party. On August 23, 1963, then Assistant

Director of the Domestic Intelligence Division, William

C. Sullivan, pursuant to the Director's request, presented

a seventy-page analysis of exploitation and influence by

the Commist Party on the American Negro population since

1919 (HQ 100-3-116-253X). This report and Mr. Sullivan's

synopsis showed a failure of the Communist Party in achieving

any significant inroads into the Negro population, and the

civil rights movement. Director Hoover responded:

"'This memo reminds me vividly

of those I received when Castro.

took over Cuba. You contended

then that Castro and his cohorts

were not Commists and not

influenced by Commmists:.. Time

alone proved you wrong. I for

one can't ignore the memos

as having only an infinitesimal

effect on the efforts to exploit the

American Negro by Coummists" (HQ 100-

3-116-253X) . .

The Director's comment had a resounding effect

on Mr. Sullivan. Seven days later, he replied:

"The Director is correct. We

were completely wrong about

believing the evidence was not

sufficient to determine some

years ago that Fidel Castro was

not a comnist or under communist

nfluence. In investigating and

## Page 301

writing about couminism and the

(Meno

from Sullivan to Belmont, August

30, 1963, App. A, Ex. 8).

Even more importantly, Mr. Sullivan also said

in response to the action that he now believed was

necessitated in determining communist influence in the

civil rights movement:

to limit ourselves as we have been

loing to legalistic proof or definite-

which one day could become decisive."

(idem.)

The FBI hierarchy had no written couments on this meno-

randum either supporting or negating the Assistant Director's

proposed line of action.

Then, in September, 1963, Mr. Sullivan recommended

"increased coverage of commist influence on the Negro"

(Memo from Baumgardner to Sullivan, September 16, 1963,

App. A, Ex. 9). The Director refused and commented:

"No I can't understand how you

can so agilely switch your think-

ing and evaluation. Just a few

weeks ago you contended that the

Coumnist influence in the racial

movement was ineffective and infin-

-117-

• NW 55220

DocId: 32989802

Page 301

---

## Page 302

many menas of specific instances

of infileration. Now you want

to load the field down with more

coverage in spite of your recent

can make up your minds what the

situation really is"' (idem.)

In commenting on a cover memo to the above Sullivan

request; Director Hoover also stated, "I have certainly

been misled by previous menos which clearly showed

camunist penetration of the racial movement. The

attached is contradictory of all that. We are wasting

manpower and money investigating i effect in racial

movement if the attached is correct'' (Memo for the Director

from Tolson; September 18, 1963, App. A, Ex. 10).

By now the Domestic Intelligence Division was

feeling the full weight of the Director's dissatisfaction

with their work product. Mr. Sullivan again replied on

September 25, 1963, in a humble marner that Division 5

had failed in its interpretation of commist infiltration

in the Negro movement (Memo from Sullivan to Belmont,

September 25, 1963, App. A, Ex. 11). The Assistant Director

asked the Director's forgiveness and requested. the oppor-

tunity to approach this grave matter in the light of the

Director's interpretation. Director Hoover sanctioned

this request but again reprimanded Mr. Sullivan for stating

-118-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 302

---

## Page 303

that commist infiltration 'has not reached the point

of control or domination." The Director curtly comnented

that "Certainly this is not true with respect to the

King cornection"' (idem). One could now foresee that

Ds. King would be closely watched by FBI persomel.

In October, 1963, the Director forwarded a request

to the Attorney General for technical surveillance of

Dr. King's residence and the SCLC office in New York City.

This time the FBI received authorization for technical

surveillance and it was instituted almost immediately.

In addition, the FBI had prepared a new analysis on

coumnist involvement in the Negro movement (Conmunism

and the Negro Movement, October 16, 1963, App. A, Ex. 12).

A cover memorandum of this analysis written by Assistant

to the Director A.H. Belmont to Associate Director Clyde

A. Tolson reads:

"The attached analysis of Communism

have a heavy impact on the Attorney

General and anyone else to whom we

disseminate it ... This memorandum

may startle the Attorney General,

side the Department"' (Memo from

Belmont to Tolson, October 17, 1963

App. A, Ex. 13).

To thé latter part, the Director wrote, 'We must do ov

duty." Mc. Belmont further said:

"Nevertheless, the memorandum is a

powerful warning against Commist

influence in the Negro movement ..."

The Director issued his feeling to this position and

added, "I am glad that you recognize at last that there'

exists such influence.'

2. Predicate for the Security Investigation

The security investigation of Dr. Martin Luther King,

JI., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

was predicated on the belief that they were under the

influence of the Communist: Party, United States of America

(CPUSA). The basis for this belief was that Dr. King relied

upon one particular advisor who was tabbed by the FBI as a

ranking Commist Party member (HQ 100-392452-13:3).

This characterization of the advisor was provided by

sources the Bureau considered reliable. The task force was

privy to this characterization through both our file review

and our September 2, 1976, conference with representatives

of the Bureau's Intelligence Division. For security

purposes the sources were not fully identified to the

task force. Therefore, the veracity of the sources and the

characterization are remaining questions.

The advisor's relationship to King and the SCLC

is amply evidenced in the files and the task force

concludes that he was a most trusted advisor. The files

are replete with instances of his counseling King and

his organization on matters pertaining to organization,

-121-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 305

---

## Page 306

finance, political strategy and speech writing. Some

examples follow:

The advisor organized, in King's name, a fund

raising society (HQ 100-106670-47, 48). This organization

and the SCLC were in large measure financed by concerts

arranged by this person (HQ 100-106670-30). He also

lent counsel to King and the SCLC on the tax consequences

of charitable gifts.

On political strategy, he suggested King make a

public statement calling for the appointment of a black

to the Supreme Court (HQ 100-106670-32, 33). This person

advised against accepting a movie offer from a movie

director and against approaching Attorney General Kermedy

on behalf of a labor leader (HQ 100-106670-24). In each

instance his advice was accepted.

King's speech before the AFL-CIO National Convention

in December, 1961 was written by this advisor (HQ 100-392452-

131). He also prepared King's May 1962 speech before the

United Packing House Workers Convention (HQ 100-106670-119).

In 1965 he prepared responses to press questions directed

to Dr. King from a Los Angeles radio station regarding

the Los Angeles racial riots and from the "New York Times"

regarding the Vietnam War.

-122-

WW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 306

---

## Page 307

The relationship between King and his advisor,

as indicated, is clear to the task force. What is not

clear is whether this relationship ought to have been

considered either a possible national security threat of

CPUSA directed. We conclude that justification may have

existed for the opening of King's security investigation

but, its protracted continuation was unwarranted.

Our conclusion that the investigation's opening

may have been justified is primarily based on menoranda,

sumarized below, written during the first six months of

1962. It is pointed out that in October, 1962 the Bureau

ordered the COMINFIL SCLC investigation (HQ 100-438794-9).

In January the Director wrote the Attorney General

and told him that one of King's advisors was a communist.

At this time he also pointed

out that the advisor wrote

King's December, 1961 AFL-CIO speech and assisted King in

SCLC matters (HQ 100-392452-131).

In March the Attorney General was advised that a

March 3, 1962 issue of 'The Nation"' magazine carried an

-123-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 307

---

## Page 308

article critical of the administration's handling of

civil rights. The article was ostensibly written by

Martin Luther King but in fact the true author was

another advisor characterized by the FBI as a ranking

member of the Communist Party (HQ 100-106670-30, 31).

In May the Attorney General learned that the CPUSA

considered King and the SCLC its most important work because

the Kennedy Administration was politically dependent upon

King (HQ 100-106670-58).

Lastly, in, June, 1962 the Attorney General became

aware that King's alleged Communist advisor had recommended

the second ranking Commmist to be one of King's principal

assistants (HQ 100-106670-79, 80). Later King accepted

the recommendation.

The conclusion that the investigation's continuance

was unwarranted is based on the following task force finding:

The Bureau to date has no evidence whatsoever that

DI. King was ever a commist or affiliated with the CPUSA. •

This was so stated to us by representatives of the Bureau's

Intelligence Division during our September 2, 1976 conference.

This admission is supported by our perusal of files, which

included informants' memoranda and physical, microphone and

telephone surveillance memoranda, in which we found no such

indication concerning Dr. King.

-124-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 308

---

## Page 309

The Bureau provided us with no documentation

that the SCLC under Dr. King was anything other than a

legitimate organization devoted to the civil rights move-

ment.

The Bureau files that we examined lacked any infor-

mation that the alleged Commists' advice was dictated by

the CPUSA or inimical to the interests of the United States.

Indeed, in early 1963 the Bureau learned through reliable

sources the principal advisor had disassociated himself

from the CPUSA. His reason was the CPUSA was not: suffi-

ciently involving itself in race relations and the civil

rights movement (HQ 100-392452-195).

3. King-Hoover Dispute

The flames of Director Hoover's antipathy for

Dr. King were fanned into open hostility in late 1962 when

DI. King criticized the Bureau's performance during an

investigation of a racial disturbance in Albany, Georgia.

Efforts to interview King by the Bureau were not successful

(HQ 157-6-2-965) and the matter lay dormant for a time.

The controversy was publicly rekindled in early 1964

when the Director testified before a House appropriations

subcommittee that he believed commist influence existed

-125-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 309

---

## Page 310

in the Negro movement. King countered by accusing the

Director of abetting racists and right winger's (HQ 100-3

116-1291). During Novenber of 1964, the Director told

a group of Washington women reporters that King was "the

most notorious liar in the country." A week later, Director

Hoover referred to "sexual degenerates in pressure groups"

in a speech at Loyola University (HQ 162-7827-16) .

Dr. King and his immediate staff requested a meeting

with Director Hoover to clear up the misunderstanding. The

meeting was held on December 1, 1964. Hoover claimed that

"he had taken the ball away from King at the beginning,"

explaining the Bureau's function and doing most of the

talking. On the other hand, King apologized for remarks

attributed to him and praised the work of the Bureau. Thus,

an uneasy truce was momentarily reached. (HQ 100-106670-563,

607.)

However, the controversy flared again when a letter

was circulated by the Southern Christian Educational Fund

(SCEF) which referred to the criticism of Dx. King by the

Director and urged the recipients of the letter to write

or wire the President to remove Hoover from office. In a

memo from Sullivan to Belmont on December 14, 1964, Sullivan

stated:

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 310

-126-

## Page 311

'In yien of this situation,

ism

makes It mandatory that we take every

prudent step that we can take to emerge

completely victoriously In this contlict,

We should not take any ineffective or

half-way measures, nor blind ourselves

to the realities of the situation."

(HQ, 100-106670-627.)

We believe the persistent controversy between Dr.

King and Director Hoover was a major factor in the Bureau's

determination to discredit Dr. King and ultimately destroy

his leadership role in the civil rights movement,

4. Technical Surveillance

Our review of FBI files and interviews with Bureau

persornel substantially confirms with a few additions the

findings which have already been reported by Mr. Murphy

and the Senate Select Cormittee on Intelligence with respect

to the electronic surveillance of De. King and his associates.

We found that some microphone surveillances were

installed in New York City against Dr. King and his associates

which have not thus far been reported. These installations

were as follows:

Americana Hotel (HQ 100-106670-2224, 4048)

Sheraton Atlantic (NY 100-136585 Sub-Files 7-8)

12/10-11/65 (symbol)

10/25-27/65 (symbol)

-127-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802

Page 311

---

## Page 312

All of these installations with the exception of

the placement at the Americana Hotel In January, 1966

appear to have been improductive either because Dr. King

did not reside at the hotel as planned or the recordings

made did not pick up any significant information.

The installation by the New York Field Office at

the Americana Hotel on January 21, to 24, 1966, caused

some consternation within the FBI hierarchy and is

illustrative of how the Bureau apparatus could, on rare

occasion, continue to function even contrary to the wishes

of the Director. 'The installation was made at the Americana

on January 21, 1966, pursuant to the request of SAC Rooney

in New York. Assistant Director William Sullivan authorized

the coverage. Bureau files indicate that Associate

Director Clyde Tolson, upon being inforned of the coverage,

wrote back on the same day in a rather perturbed fashion to

have the microphone removed "at once." Tolson advised the

Director that "no one here" approved the coverage and that

he had again instructed Sullivan to have no microphone

installations without the Director's approval, Hoover

confirmed Tolson's directive.

(HQ 100-106670-2224X) .

No symbol number was ever attached to this coverage

as was the standard practice. This was apparently due to

the strong disapproval voiced by Headquarters.

Yet, despite

-128-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 312

---

## Page 313

Hoover's orders, the coverage was maintained and a good

deal of intelligence on King's personal activities was

obtained and transcribed. These activities are reflected

in a six page memorandum. (HQ 100-106670-4048.)

Irrespective of the level of Bureau approval

which was required for electronic surveillance installa-

tions during the King years, our review reinforced the

conclusions of the Senate Select Comittee that the purposes

behind this intelligence gathering became twisted. Several

instances of Bureau correspondence are instructive. Section

Chief Baumgardner in recarmending coverage of King in

Honolulu urged an exposure of King's "moral wealess"

so that he could be "for the security of the nation, can-

pletely discredited"' (HQ 100-106670 June File, Memo Baungardner

to Sullivan, January 28, 1964). In a similar meno from

Sullivan to Belmont recormending coverage in Milwaukee at

the Schroeder Hotel; the expressed purpose was to gather

information on "entertairment" in which King might be engaging

similar to that "uncovered at the Willard Hotel"' (HQ 100-

106670 June File, Memo Sullivan to Belmont, January 17, 1964).

Director Hoover, upon being informed of the results

of the surveillance, ordered that they all be immediately

transcribed despite Deloach's recommendation that the tran-

scribing be done later (HQ 100-106670-1024). As each of the

-129-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 313

---

## Page 314

file reviews has shown, portions of summaries of the

transcripts were widely disseminated among governmental

officials.

These disseminations included a rather

comprehensive six volume transmittal by the Bureau in

June, 1968. This was at the apparent request of the

President through Special Counsel Larry Temple for all

information concerning Dr. King, including the instructions

and approval of former Attorney General Kennedy regarding

the electronic surveillance of King Memo R. W. Smith to

•William Sullivan, June 2, 1968, referring to memo Deloach

to Tolson, May 24, 1968, setting forth the President's

request). Included with the transcripts were several

sumaries, previously disseminated, and several hundred

pages of Bureau commimications to the White House from

1962 to 1968 regarding King and his associates. The

purpose of the White House request was not stated, but it

was the most complete accumulation of transmitted informa-

tion on the electronic surveillance of King which we

encountered during our review of Bureau files. The task

force noted the timing of the alleged White House request

and subsequent transmittal particularly in light of

-130-

NW 55220 Docid: 32989802

Page 314

---

## Page 315

Director Hoover's commiication to the White House on •

March 26, 1968 (included in the transmittal) which

advised that Robert Kernedy had attempted to contact

Dr. King before announcing his candidacy for the

Presidency (HQ 100-106670-3262).

The task force reviewed selected portions of all

of the transcripts in the King file as well as selected

portions of several tapes from which the transcripts

were obtained. An inventory of the tapes reviewed is

set forth below:

1) Washington, D.C., 1/5-6/64 (Willard Hotel,

15 reels) - Reel Nos. 1-6, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14

2) Atlanta Tape (symbol) (one reel)

3) Composite Tape 12/15/64

Track No. 1 ~ Washington, D.C. recordings

-(edited version of 15 reels.

Essentially, we reviewed the tapes by listening to the

beginning, middle, and end of each tape and compared it to

the corresponding transcript. They were basically accurate

transcriptions in the sense that what was in the transcripts

was also on the tapes. However, some material on the tapes

was not put on the transcripts apparently because either

that portion of the recording was garbled or unclear or

it was considered unimportant.

Our review of the composite tape, the Atlanta

tape and the agents handwritten notes inclured in the

box with the recordings from the Willard Hotel gave an

additional indication of where the Bureau's interest

lay with respect to Dr. King. The composite tape contained

"highlights" of the fifteen reels of tape from the willard

Hotel and appeared to consist of little more than episodes

of private conversations and activities which the Bureau

chose to extract fron the original recordings. The

Atlanta tape was obtained from the telephone

tap on the

King residence and consisted of several of Dr. King's

conversations. These included conversations of Di. King

with his wife regarding his personal life and had nothing

to do with his political or civil rights activities. The

handwritten notes from the original Willard tapes contained

notations as to what point in the tape a particular personal

activity or conversation took place.

5. COINIEIPRO Type and Other Illegal Activities

The task force has documented an extensive program

within the FBI during the years 1964 to 1968. to discredit

Do. King. Pursuant to a Bureau meeting on December 23, 1963

to plan a King strategy and the Sullivan proposal in January,

1964 to promoté a new black leader, the FBI accelerated its

-132-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 316

---

## Page 317

program of disseminating derogatory information, which

was heavily fraught with the Bureau's own characteriza-

tions of King, to various individuals and organizations

who were in critical positions vis-a-vis the civil rights

leader. Our review has essentially confirmed those already

performed by the Civil Rights Division and the Senate Select

Carmittee and we, therefore, do not dwell on those areas

which they have already covered. We did find, however,

additional proposed activities against Dr. King, some of

which were approved by the Director. They are instructive

not only in revealing the extent to which the Bureau was

willing to carry its efforts but also in showing the

atmosphere among some of the rank and file which this

program against King created.

In November, 1964, the Bureau discovered that

Dx. King was desirous of meeting with high British officials

while in England during King's planned trip to Europe.

Section Chief Baumgardner recommended a briefing for the

purpose of informing British officials concerning King's

purported commist affiliations and private life

(HO 100-106670-522, 523). Within three days the briefings

had been completed (HQ 100-106670-525, 534, 535).

## Page 318

One particular dissemination, the contents of which

was not revealed in the files, was apparently initiated

and carried out personally by the Director. On January 22,

1965, the SAC in Atlanta advised Mr. Sullivan that,

pursuant to their electronic surveillance, the Bureau

learned that King had phoned Ralph Abernathy: and complained

that Hoover had had a meeting with a particular Atlanta

official while in Washington attending the Inauguration.

According to King, when this official returned to

Atlanta he contacted Dr. King senior and passed on a

"good deal" of information. According to Sullivan's.

memo to Belmont, Dr. King, JI., was very upset (HQ 100-

106670-768). The files did not reveal any formal proposal

for this briefing but Section Chief Baumgardner later speculated

that the Atlanta official was Chief of Police. Jenkins

since the Director had met with him on January 18, 1965

(HQ 100-106670-780). The files do not indicate whether

the Director suggested that the information be passed on

to DI. King's father.

In connection with the post-assassination

efforts to declare a national holiday in memory of

Dr. King the Senate Select Committee has outlined

in its report the attempts by the Bureau to prevent

such a declaration by briefing various members of

Congress on King's background (HQ: 100-106670-3586).

We discovered that the Bureau also sent a monograph

on King to the President and the Attorney General

in 1969 for this same purpose (HQ 100-106670-3559).

The Bureau's efforts to discredit Dr. King's

movement also included attempts to damage the

reputation of King's family and friends. The Bureau

looked very closely at Coretta King although a

security investigation was never opened. This

included scrutinizing her travels in an attempt

to uncover possible facts embarrassing to her.

These attempts also included a plan, proposed

-135-

NW 55220 DocId:32989802 Page 319

---

## Page 320

by Assistant to the Director Deloach and approved

by Hoover to leak information to the press that Coretta

King and Ralph Abernathy were deliberately plotting to

keep the assassination in the news by claiming a conspiracy

existed in order to keep monetary contributions flowing

for their benefit (11Q 44-38861-5654).

Ralph Abernathy and Andrew Young also became Bureau

targets. Shortly after the assassination the field was

instructed to report any information on possible "immoral

activities" of King's two associates (HQ 62-108052-Urrecorded

serial, Atlanta to Director, April 29, 1968). Presumably

there were COINTELPRO type purposes behind this request.

The Atlanta Field Office in attempting to demonstrate

the initiative and imagination demanded by Headquarters

proposed additional measures against Ralph Abernathy. The

Bureau learned that after Dr. King's death, Rev. Abernathy

may have voiced some concern over possible assassination

attempts on his own life. The Atlanta office proposed that.

the Bureau begin notifying Abernathy directly (instead of

only informing the police) of all threats against him in

order to confuse and worry him (HQ 62-108052-Unrecorded

serial, Atlanta to Director, March 28, 1969). This activity

was not approved by Headquarters.

-136-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 320

---

## Page 321

Bureau files indicate that the FBI may have also

attempted to help the executive branch in its efforts

to deal with Abernathy after King's death. In a memo

to Associate Director Tolson, Director Hoover related

a telephone conversation with former Vice President

Agnew in which Mr. Agnew expressed concern over the

"inflanatory" statements which Abernathy had made.

The Vice President was seeking information from Hoover

which could be useful in destroying the credibility of

Rev. Abernathy. Hoover agreed to the request (HQ 100-

106670-Unrecorded serial, Hoover to Tolson, May 18, 1970).

We did not find what information, if any, was forwarded

to the Vice President.

Finally, we discovered that a series of illegal

surreptitious entries was conducted by the FBI. Some

of these entries had as one purpose, among others, the

obtaining of information about Dr. King. The FBI in

the review of its indices was unable to locate records

of any entries onto the premises of Dr. King or the SCLC.

-137-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 321

---

## Page 322

The agents began to retrieve information about

Dr. King during these entries through the use of photo-

graphs. In one instance a supervisor in the appropriate

field office requested authority to conduct an entry

for the express purpose of obtaining information about

DI. King. The proposed entry was approved at Head-

quarters pursuant to a telephone call by an Inspector

and was later conducted.

On four subsequent occasions the Bureau again

conducted entries and obtained information concerning

King and the SCLC. On one such occasion a specimen of

King's handwriting was obtained. The purpose of

gathering this piece of intelligence was not revealed.

Bureau policy at the time of these entries

required" the approval of such field requests by

Director Hoover or Associate Director Tolson (Meno

Director, FBI, to Attorney General, September 23, 1975).

We assume that such approval was granted. Handwritten

-138-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 322

---

## Page 323

-

notations on the field office memos indicate that

the Bureau was advised of the entries in each case.

We also raise the issue of these illegal entries

because aside from being violative of Fourth Amendment

rights the entries ran the risk of invading a privileged

relationship.

We note in passing that the FBI continued to

employ an informant in the SCLC despite the fact that

the informant conceded to agents that the informant had

embezzled some SCLC funds. The Bureau voiced strong .

disapproval of these activities. Yet, no legal or

disciplinary action was ever taken with respect to

the informant (HQ. 134-11126-56, 57).

B. Critical Evaluation of the Security Investigation

In the area of domestic intelligence the mandate

of the FBI has been both broadly and vaguely defined.

It is stated in the Code of Fedéral Regulations as: follows:

-139-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 323

---

## Page 324

(The FBI Shall:) carry out the Presidential

directive of Septerber 6, 1939, as reaffirmed

oy Presidential directives of January 8,, 1943

July 24, 1950 and December 15, 1953, designating

the Federal Bureau of Investigation to take

charge of investigative work in matters relating

to espionage, sabotage, subversive activities,

and related matters (28 CFR 0.85 (d)) .

Given this charter and the history of the sometimes

overpowering influence of the views of the late Director

J. Edgar Hoover on his subordinates and on succesive

Attomeys General, it was understandable that a security

investigation should be initiated into the possible

influence of the Communist Party, U.S.A., On DI. Martin

Luther King, JI. Iwo of King's close advisors, at the

outset of the security matter, were reported to be

Carmunist Party members by sources relied upon by the

Bureau.

The security investigation continued for almost

six years until Dr. King's death. It verified, in our

view, that one alleged Communist was a very influential

advisor to Dr. King (and hence the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference) on the strategy and tactics of

King's leadership of the black civil rights movement of

the early and mid-sixties. Another had no such weight

although he seemed to be of use to King. But this

very lengthy investigative concentration on King and on

-140-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 324

---

## Page 325

the principal advisor established, in our opinion,

that he did not "sell"' Di. King any course of conduct

or of advocacy which can be identified as commmist or

"Party line". King, himself never varied publicly or

privately from his connitment to non-violence and did

not advocate the overthrow of the government of the

United States by violence or subversion. To the contrary,

he advocated an end to the discrimination and disenfran-

chisement of minority groups which the Constitution and

the courts denounced in terms as strong as his. We

concluded that Dr. King was no threat to domestic security.

And the Bureau's continued intense surveillance

and investigation of the advisor clearly developed that

he had disassociated himself from the Communist Party

in 1963 because he felt it failed adequately to serve

the civil rights movement. Thus the linch-pin of the

security investigation of Dr. King had pulled himself

out.

We think the security investigation which included

both physical and technical surveillance, should have been

terminated on the basis of what was learned in 1963.

That it was intensified and augmented by a COINTELPRO type

campaign against Dr. King was unwarranted; the COINTELPRO

type campaign, moreover, was ultra vires and very probably

in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241 (and 242), i.e. felonious.

-141-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 325

---

## Page 326

The continuing security investigation reflects also

that the Attorney General and the Division charged with

responsibility for internal security matters failed badly

in what should have been firm supervision of the FBI's

internal security activities.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS

A. As Io The Murder Investigation

The task force does not fault the technical

competence of the investigation conducted into the

death of Dr. King. We found no new evidence which

calls for action by State or Federal Authorities.

Our concern has developed over administrative

concomitants of the crime detection tactics.

1. The progress of such sensitive cases

as the King murder investigation and the development

of legally sufficient evidence to sustain prosecution

are properly the ultimate resporisibility of the Division

of the Department having supervision of the kind of

criminal prosecution involved. The Division head should

delineate what progress reports he wishes. The Bureau

should not be permitted to manipulate its submission of

reports to serve its purposes, such as the protection

of its public relation efforts, or the prevention of the

responsible Division of the Department from causing the

Bureau to pursue a line of inquiry which the Bureau does

not approve. The Attorney General and his Assistants are

the officers most accountable to the electorate and they,

not the police agency, must maintain effective supervision.

-143-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 327

---

## Page 328

2. As a corollary of our espousal of tignter

Department authority over the FBI, we recomnend that the

Bureau's public relations activities and press relations

be controlled by the Attorney General's Office of Public

Information. Clear directives to prevent the development

of personality cults around particular Bureau Directors

and officials should be drawn. Bureau press releases should

be cleared through the Office of Public Information.

3. The task force recommends that in sensitive

cases no criminal action be instituted by the Bureau without

the closest coordination and consultation with the supervising

Division of the Department. This supervision by the Depart-

ment should be as tight as the control and consultation the

Bureau had with its Field Offices as exhibited in our review

of the assassination investigation.

4. It was observed that almost no blacks were in

the FBI special agent's corps in the 1960's and none in

the Bureau's hierarchy. This undoubtedly had the effect

of limiting not only the outlook and understanding of the

problems of race relations, but also must have hindered the

ability of investigators to commicate fully with blacks

during the murder investigation. By way of illustration

had there been black agents in the Memphis Field Office

participating fully in the investigation of Dr. King's

murder, it is unlikely that the interviews with

-144-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 328

---

## Page 329

at least three black members of the Memphis Police and Fire

Department would have been overlooked. It is also very

probable that black citizen "lead"' input would have been

greater.

B. As To The Security Investigation

The task force was charged to address itself

particularly to the question of whether the nature of the

relationship between the Bureau and Dr. King called for

criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or other

appropriate action. Our responses follow.

1. Because the five year statute of limitations

has long since run we carnot recormend criminal prosecution

of any Bureau persomel, past or present, responsible for

the possible criminal harrassment of Dr. King. (18 U.S.C.

3282). No evidence of a continuing conspiracy was found.

2. The responsibility for initiating and prolonging

the security investigation rested on the deceased Director

of the Bureau and his immediate lieutenants, some of whom

are also deceased and the remainder of whom are retired.

They are beyond the reach of disciplinary action. The few

Bureau personnel who had anything to do with the King security

investigation and who are still in active service, did not

make carmand decisions and merely followed orders. We do not

-145-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802 Page 329

---

## Page 330

think they are the proper subjects of any disciplinary

action. Some of the activities conducted, such as the

technical electronic surveillance, had the approval of

the then Attorney General. The Courts had not adequately

dealt with what authority rested in the executive branch

to initiate such surveillance in the interest of "hational

security". We do not think the "leg men" in the Bureau

should be held to an undefined standard of behavior, much

less a standard not observed by the highest legal officer

of the government.

The Bureau's COINTELPRO type activities, the illicit

dissemination of raw investigative data to discredit

DI. King, the efforts to intimidate him, to break up his

marriage, and the explicit and implicit efforts to black-

mail him, were not filly known to the Department, but were

none-the-less ordered and directed by Director Hoover,

Assistant to the Director DeLoach, Assistant Director

Sullivan and the Section Chief under him.

In our view their subordinates were far removed

from decision responsibility. Moreover; we think the

subordinates clearly felt that, by reason of Director

Hoover's overpowering and intimidating domination of the

Bureau; they had no choice but to 'implement the Bureau's

directions. Punitive action against the very few

-146-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 330

---

## Page 331

remaining subordinate agents would seem to the task force

to be inappropriate in these circunstances and at this

very late date.

3. The Bureau's illicit surveillance produced

tapes and transcripts concerning King and many others.

These may be sought by King's heirs and representatives.

Worse still, they may be sought by members of the public

at large under the Freedon of Infomation Act. We

recommend that these tapes and transcripts be sealed and

sent to the National Archives and that the Congress be

asked to pass legislation denying any access to then

whatever and authorizing and directing their total

destruction along with the destruction of material in

reports and memoranda derived from then.

4. The potential for abuse by the individual

occupying the öffice of Director of the FBI has been

amply demonstrated by our investigation. We think it is

a responsibility of the Department in the first instance

and, secondarily, of the Congress to oversee the concuct

of the FBI (and the other police agencies of the govem-

ment). We endorse the establisment by the Attorney

General of the Office of Professional Responsibility on

December 9, 1975, as an effective means for intra-departmental

policing of the Bureau. We also think the permanent

-147-

NW 55220 DocId: 32989802 Page 331

---

## Page 332

Senate Select Camittee on Intelligence is an appro-

priate agency of the legislative arm to oversee the

performance of the Bureau. Both the Office of Pro-

fessional Responsibility and the Senate Select Cornittee

should be expressly designated in their respective

enabling regulations and resolutions to be a place to

which Bureau subordinates may complain, confidentially

and with impunity, of orders. which they believe to

threaten a violation of the civil rights and liberties

of citizens and inhabitants of the United States.

5. It seems to us that the unauthorized malicious

dissemination of investigative data from FBI files should

be more than the presently prescribed misdemeanor (5 USC

552a (1) (1)). A felony penalty should be added.

Parenthetically, it should be noted here that it

should be made clear that it is improper (but not criminal)

-148-

NW 55220

DocId: 32989802

Page 332

---

## Page 333

for the Bureau to by-pass the Attorney General and deal

directly with the White House.

6. The task force recommends that the FBI have no

authority to engage in COINIFIPRO type activities which

involve affirmative punitive action following Star

Chamber decisions with respect to citizens or inhabitants

(See 18 U.S.C. 241 and 242). We believe that the guide

lines which the present Attorney General has established

to govern the FBI's domestic security investigations

effectively preclude these activities. Those guidelines

moreover, appear to us to permit only strictly legal

investigative techniques to be employed in full scale

domestic security investigations. 'This too we endorse.

The foregoing comprises our report and recommenda-

tions. It is respectfully submitted.

The Maytin Luther King, JI.

Reference is made to. the enclosed material on which the

• Director has written:

"This memo reminds me vividly of those I

received when Castro took over Cuba: You contended then that Castro and

his cohorts were not Communists and not influenced by Communists. Time

alone proved you wrong. I for one can't ignore the memos re King,

et al as. having ouly an infinitesinal

effect on the efforts to exploit

.

the American legro by the Connunists."

The Director is correct.

We were completely wrong about

believing the evidence was not

sufficient to determine some years ago

ithat Fidel Castro was not a communist or under communist influence.

Investigating and writing about comunism and the Anerican degio, we

had better renember this and profit by the lesson it should teach us.

I do think that nuch of the difficulty relating to the memoran

dum rightly questioned by the Director is to be found centerea in che

word "inflyence.

"e do not have, and no Government agency or

private

organization has, any yardstick which can accurately measure "influence"

I'a this particular context,

even when we know it does exist such as in

the case of the obvious influence of

over Martin Luther King and King's Influence ovei öther tegrö

Jeaders." Personally, I believe in the light or king's powerful

demagogic speech yesterday he stands head and shoulders over all other

Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of

Negroes.

We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the

nost dungerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoing

On determining membership of regroes in the Communist Fasty,

we sre. not confronted with the same problem.

He do have here accurate

yardsticks for establishing membership.

These we must not ignore.

The öld

communist principle still holds:

"Connunism must be built with non-

communist hasis " Therefore, it nay be unrealistic to limit oursrives as

we have been floing to legalistic-proof or detiultely concuuszy?

In court or before Congressional

committees that the Communist Party, USA, does wield

substantial

Int luence over Negroes which one day could become decisive.

The memorandum which the Director penetratively questioned,

while showing in the details the communist impact on Negroes, did

- suffer from such limitations. •These

limitations we will maise every

effort to lift in the future.

The great amount of attention this

should enable us to do this..

Eor example,

here at the Seat of Government, the Negro -

communist question takes up as a whole the time of one supervisor arc

during the past few weeks four men have been so occupied.

Additionally,

(1) specialized instructions are regularly given the field on communist

Infiltration of the Negro; (2) monographs have been written on the

• subject and widely disseminated; (3) regularly disseminated are memoranda

and reports; (4) August 21, 1963, we devoted the entire Current Intelli~

1963, (119 copies of this Analysis were disseminated to 44 agencies of

the Government), (5) nuch material on the issue is given to Agents at

In-Service; and (6) an SAC Letter is under preparation in this Division

now giving the field the benefit of what we learned from the Negro Maich

on Hashington and issuing instructions for increased coverage of

communist influence on the Negro..

Predication:

Reference is made to the enclosed memorandum dated 9/16/63

and to the attached proposed SAC Letter.

On returning from a few days leave I have been advised of

the Diractor's continued dissatisiaction with the mannei in which

ve prepared a Brief on the above-captioned matter and subsequent.

memoranda on the same subject matter:

This situation is very

disturbing to those of us in the Domestic Intelligence Division

responsible for this area of work, and ve certainly want to do

We absolutely will

not be stubborn about admitting any mistakes we have made or be

stiff-necked and unbending concerning our analysis of this matter.

The Director indicated he would not approve our last SAC Letter

until there sas a clarification and a meeting of minds relative to

the question of the extent of communist influence ovei Negioes and

their leaders.

In this menorandum

I will seriously and sincerely.

try to clarify a most regretable situation.

It is prepared not on

official office menorandum but rather on plain bond believing that

this discussion need not be made à matter of official record..

в..

Common Agreement:

first, I am sure we all are in agreement.on the following

which was in both the cover memorandum and the detailed brief

attashed:

(1) for the past 44 years the Communist Party, USA, has

spent enormous sums of money and ceaseless efforts to intiuence

Negroes and to make communists out of them; (2)

the 19 million

Regroes in the country today constitute the greatest single racial

target of the Conmunist Party, USA; (3) Negro leader Martin Luther

King,

does have as an extremnl: important

advisor

.: (4)

1ye

are right now in this nation engaged in a form. of social revolution

and the time has never been so right for exploitation of the

Negroes by communist propagandists; and (5).: the Communist Party

could in the future make prodigious strides and great successes with

the American Negro to the

serious detriment of our national security.

RE:

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL LATTERS.

showing communist involvement in Negro racial matters in this nation,

relative to which me can all agico.

Essence of the Situation:

The essence of the situation seems to be this:

presented what facts there are in our files in the Briet in question

and I know that the Director certainly would not maat us to do otaci

than this. The position taken at the tine the Brick Has writton was

that, while there is communist influence being exerted on Negroes

and Negro leaders, It

omination. this Bistorically has

ors at reached the nons conne ele tureau

The Historical Pusition: do de

Tegiacati

For example, in a detailed document prepared on Conmunist

Party and the Negro iu 1953, we Iind the statement referring to "the

failure of the Communist Party to attract even a significani number

of Negroes in the United States to its number. "

Another exauple is

to be found in au analysis in this same field prepared by the Bureau

in 1956 to the effect that comunist ciforts have been "unsuccessful

a state or national level" in infilirating "legitinate Negro-

frateraal, protest and improvement organizations," although they made

limited success in some "isolated chapters."

Ibe Director's book,

Masters of Deceit, published in 1952, States:

"It became obvious

that. the Party,

despite fient aflorts, had tailed to win over even

a significant minority of Negroes." In 1960 the Director's statement

to the Committee on the Judiciary:

United States Senate, reads:

"It is 20 secret that one o1 lll biiierest disappointments of

communistic eiforts in this lintion has been their failure to lure

our Negro citizens Into the Party."

(n 1962 similar public statement:

were made. On page seven of the brief submitted to the Director

under the date of August 23, 1963,

this historical position was

restated and it was said, "Onc of the bitterest disappointments of

the communists has been their sinile railure to lure any significant

number of our Negro citinons into the Prity." This statement was

sot forth again in the cover sonorandur which the Director marked.

The point I wish to 5a:0 here is this: The fact that this

Derset to assume the MA WAs Do connois time, as the

Times aid conditions change aid, 25

the ovidence mounts, inturally so necd to change our position along

SAC' letter' to the Field

I would like to set forth here briefly thy I think that

the euclosed sac Letier, which was, returned to us by the Director,

should be sent to the field offices.

My first reason is this:

He need to renew our eiforts and keep the pressure on

no stone unturned to develop every

follow up this matter evermore closely with them. My second

reason why I think the sAc letter should be sent is related

to the present changing situation inthe Communist Party • Negro

beginning of evermore systematic activities on their part to

toward this end, and it should result in our developing important
