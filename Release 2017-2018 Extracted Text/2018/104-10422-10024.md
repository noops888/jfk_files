From a review of the:Agency's file on Lee Harvey OSWALD,

it becomes apparent that the Agency and its-field stations, parti-

cularly in México City and Miaimi, were not unmindful of the possi-

\ bility that OSWALD did not act alone. During the first few weeks

|-after the assassination, Headquarters, upon at least three occa-

sions, exhorted the Mexico City Station to continue "all your

7| coverage of the Cuban and Soviet installations..." On Z8 Novem
ber “1963, the Chief; 7/3, told the Mexico city Station that ‘there

bones, and a noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin.

He spoke radpidly with a Cuban accent and did speak some English.
