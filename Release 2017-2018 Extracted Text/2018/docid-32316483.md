ADMINISTRATIVE: (CONT ' D).

Detectives GERALD LANGTON and JAMES FALLACE,

Central Intelligence Bureau (CIB), NYCPD, who are

contacted on a continuing basis as they investigate

criminal violations of labor matters, were contacted

during August and September, 1964.

They advised that nothing new has been learned

of the affairs of Local 707 due to their Bureau being placed

on full time investigation of racial problems in the New

York City area.

LANGTON stated that it is hoped that these matters

will be ended shortly and they can resume their duties of

investigating labor matters.

FALLACE advised that the slates of various groups:

should be

appearing by September, in preparation for the fall

elections this year:

They advised that they will be in touch with SA

SULLIVAN upon their resumption of their regular duties.

The following Informants were contacted during

July and August, 1964, and could provide no current pertinent

information of the affairs of Local 707 or its officials:

PCI JACK DI MARTINO

7/21/64

CSNY 4519-C:

7/16/64 - 9/1/64

PCI GEORGE DONAHUE

7/28/64 -

8/26/64

PCI ROGER ALVAREZ

7/20/64 - 8/25/64

Regarding the attempts to interview SALVATORE

D'EORIO as set out in the details of this report, D'EORIO

was telephonically contacted on two of these occasions and

arrangements were made for an interview.

D'EORIO failed to

appear as was arranged in each instance.

Additional attempts

are being made to interview D'EORIO, as it 1s felt he possesses

knowledge which would be valuable to this investigation.

ADMINISTRATIVE : (CONT' D)

It will be noted that NY 4318-C, who is NY I-l

in the details of this report, is a close friend of FRANK

CONNOLLY, former official of Local 707 and mentioned also

in the details of this report.

NY 4318-C is endeavoring to persuade CONNOLLY to

cooperate with the FBl in bringing to light shakedowns and

other matters relative to Local 707.

In a meeting between the informant and CONNOLLY

during July, 1964, CONNOLLY indicated a desire to cooperate

with the FBI, but several confusing issues concerning control

of the union have arisen and he (CONNOLLY) did not desire to

talk to anyone just yet.

This matter is being followed closely with the

informant so that CONNOLLY will be interviewed at the most

advantageous time in an attempt to obtain his fullest

cooperation.
