30 Processing of LIENVOY Information. The only change in the LlENVOY

processing during this period was the addition of another line (2j-J-77), Elena

VAZQUEZ, Gomez, to those lines from which LIE:VOY transcribers provide

full Spaniah transcripts.

This was to support a Headquarters PBRUMEN/ AMROD

request and places a heavy burden on the three transcribers who are also doing

full transcripto of the eleven otner lines noted in reference. During June/July

1904, there were lazz tapes recorded from which 1:38 pages of text were

transcribed. In addition, 230 pages of lext were transcribed in she daily

"resumen" which consieted of only the significant conversating from lines

not fully transcribed.

1. Exploitalion of lIEt:VOY Information. In carly June tho Firel of a lask

frIce of lour persons from SR Division arrived at the Mexico Sration to begin

collating information on Soviet Embagay personnel. This daln was largely

collected from LIONVOY over the past four years and has remained in the

Station files in the absence of personnel for proper processing and exploitation.

MEXI-2705 provided information for a potential REDCOAT LCIMPROVE

recruitment.

MEX1-9757 reported travel uf Soviet officials to lie Mexican-United

States borier area to j'urchase à ew car jl May to - June. The information

again reported by them to their respective Washington ricaiquariers ae well as

back to time Mexico Station.

ALEXI-9613, 9310 and 0412 reported U.S. calizen Ray SPEDDING Was

trying lo arrange truugh the Soviet Einibasay la Mexico for permissio lo 10 10

the USSR.. (Subsequently, in late August 1904, tha Moxican press reported that

SPEDDING had committed suicide in liverl Edison.)

LIENVOY was of connderable value in monitoring the reaction 1o

AMSTRUT -" defection and also was of value in monitoring the activities of

AMSTET -1.

In addition to these roported individually, several other U.S, Citizens

contacted both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.

When identifed, these names

were reported tolleadquartera and in come cases to the Ollice of the Legil Attache.

MEXI-020 * revealed a contact by Ana Luisa DURAND, Puerto Rican,

and the Cuban Embasy regarding a teaching position in Cuba.

MEXI-0327 and 042t reported that the Czechs intended to open an

Embassy in Costa Rica.

5. Liaison. CURTIS had several meetings during this period with LIENVOY-L

and LIELEGANT. Subjects discussed were reported by cable.

6. Security: There were no security problema or incidents during khie

period.

7. Technical. There were no technical problems during this period.

3. Personnel. In July, representativen'of the Inspector General's Office

viaited the Mexico City Station, reviewed LIENVOY projecé files, and met

outside the Station with Arnold E. AREMART. Thoy appeared to be pleased

with the project and recommended that Siall Agent AREHARI be given a promotion.

Thomae W. LUND, Mesico Hranch Chief, visited the Mexico Cily

Station 16-19 July and was given a general briefing on LIENVOY.

MEXI-028é reported the desire of the wife of Orville lIORSFALL to

obtain employment ad'?he Belgian Embassy. As a result a this and for better

security in transporting the LIENVOY reels each day, HORSFALL was eliminaled

from LIENVOY as a courier. He still has tourist cover and it was felt unnecossary

to take the risk of an automobile accident or exposure of his early morning

meetings by accident or design should the Belgians conduct an investigation or

Such exposure could be most embarrasing uuring the pre-

election period d LITEMPO-2. RIGGS and AREHART again resumed the daily

deliveries of reels to the transcribers or their care officer. The risk of an

accident is always present but both RIGGS and AREHART have some cover which

should prevent examination of their briefcases.

The wife of Douglas J. FEINGLASS was employed to assist with

LIENVOY translation and transcription duties, freeing FEINCLASS to concentrate

on assessment and characterization reports on Soviet Embasey persomel as well

as building up a library of voice recordings.
