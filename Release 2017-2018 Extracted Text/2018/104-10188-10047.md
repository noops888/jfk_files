full Spanish transcripts. This was to support a Headquarters PBRUMEN/AMROD
request and places a heavy burden on the three transcribers who are also doing

1944, there were 1222 tapes recorded from whicn 3438 pages of text were

trying to arrange through the Soviet Embassy tn Mexico for permission to Yo to
the USSR,. (Subsequently, in late August 19od, the Mexican press reported that
SPEDDING had committed suicide in Hotel Edison, )

LIENVOY was of considerable value in monitoring the reaction to
AMSTRUT-2 defection and also was of value in monitoring the activities of
AMSTET-1.

In addition to these reported individually, several othor U.S, citizens

contacted both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, When identified, these names

obtain employment at’fhe Belgian Embassy, As a result o this and for better
security in transporting the LIENVOY reels each day, HORSFALL was eliniiuated
from LIENVOY as a courier, He still has tourist cover and it was felt unnecessary
to take the risk of an automobile accicent or exposure of hia early morning
meetings by accident or design should the Belgians conduct an investigation or
neighborhood check, uch exposure could be most embarrassing uuring the pre~
election period ¢ LITEMPO-2. RIGGS and AREHART again reaumed the daily
deliveries of reels to the transcribers or their case officer, The risk of an
accident is always present but both RIGGS and AREHART have some cover which

should prevent examination of their briefcases,

LIENVOY translation and traascription duties, freeing FEINGLASS to concentrate
von assessment and characterization reports on Soviet Embavey personnel as well
as building up a library of voice recordings.
