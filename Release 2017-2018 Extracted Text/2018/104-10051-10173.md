O Lee Harvey Oswald

Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file was first opened

the name of Lee Henry Oswald on 9 December 1960

as a result of his

"defection" to the USSR on 31 October

1959 and renewed interest in Oswald brought about by his

queries concerning possible reentry into the United States.

The file contains two Federal Bureau of

Investigation reports,

dated 25 May 1960 and 3 July 1961,

respectively, which

contain interviews of Oswald's mother

and brother concerning

the possible return to the United

States of Oswald and of his loyalty.

The American Embassy

in Moscow also sent two telegrams in May and October 1961

conveying Oswald's wish to return to the United States

and five of Oswald's letters asking for compliance with

his request.

The file also contains an Oswald letter sent

to the Marine Corps disputing the Marine Corps discharge

classification of him as undesirable.

It is believed that

the above

documents were also circulated among the FBI,

State Department,

Immigration and Naturalization Service

as Naval

Intelligence.

There is also a memorandum dated 16 October 1963

Win Scott, COS Mexico City to

the United States

Ambassador there concerning Oswald's visit to Mexico

City and to the Soviet Embassy there in late September-

early October 1963.

Subsequently there were several Mexico

City cables in October 1963

also concerned with

visit to Mexico City, as well as his visits to the Soviet

and Cuban Embassies.

These cables were passed on

the Fbl,

State Department and Naval Intelligence while

Mexico City Station was told to pass the information on to
