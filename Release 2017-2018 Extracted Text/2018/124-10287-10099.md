(JFK)

Enclosed herewith are the original and 7 copies of

a letterhead memorandum, dated

and captioned as above.

The letterhead memorandum

is classified "Confidential"

since it contains information from CG 5824-S*, a highly placed

informant.

The informants, mentioned in the LHM, are identified

as follows:

The NYO feels

that the

93

100-339235

trip of RICHARD FRANK is most

C

Co Wick significant because of

its apparent urgency.

It appears also

that the subject cannot

get her passport in

time to be in

England this Saturday,

so her husband is going in her place.

It would appear, therefore, that he has an appointment to meet

someone in England.

The Bureau is requested through liaison

to contact

and Legat, London, and have

them attempt to discreetly

determine RICHARD FRANK's contacts and activities in England

and elsewhere.

Discretion should be used so as RICHARD FRANK

does not become aware of investigative interest in him.

A copy of this airtel is being designated for WO

because of their previous investigation in this matter.
