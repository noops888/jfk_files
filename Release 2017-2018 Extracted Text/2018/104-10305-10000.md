MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel

Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13 August 1981.

Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls

forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone

number.

When the call was answered with the Houston number, Novel indi

cated that he was calling the New Orleans office.

He was told that Farris

was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to

Houston.

Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency

file under the Freedom of Information Act.

He was told that he should

address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request.

He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent

to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make

sense of it. He did, however, discover. that it contained information that

was erroneous

and he asked how to go about refuting the misinformation

and/or correcting the file. It was suggested that he write a letter

detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made.

not seem

interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of

questioning.

He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of

the Agency directly. He was told that he should use the local represent-

ative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the

Director. : Novel

indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but

was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information

mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified

representative of the. Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding

information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a small

sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about

i that," then hung up.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

FROM

: Raymond M. Reardon

SUBJECT

: Pending Litigation - Gordon Novel

1.

Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure

who first came to the attention of this

Agency during the

- Garrision

Investigation into the assassination of

President Kennedy. From time to time he has claimedto

be a CIA employee or to be acting on behalf of the CIA.

He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no

contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits

to

Domestic Collection Division offices.

He has been in

several scrapes with the law, most recently in October

1976 when he was on trial for conspiracy to firebomb

several buildings in New Orleans.

Mr. Novel has now

filed a civil suit claiming alleged violations of his

rights and interference with his personal affairs.

He

is not suing the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard

Osborn as a defendant.

Mr. Osborn has been

in touch with

the Office of General Counsel seeking representation by

the Justice Department since he feels his being named in

the suit probably resulted from his official duties with

the Agency.

2.

On 27 April 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the

Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to

inquire whether we had a file on Novel and if the file

showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named

Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit.

Mr. Jameson was

given a rundown on the nature of the information in

Novel's file and was also provided with Mr. Osborn's

retirement date, t February 194.

Mr. Jameson mentioned

that most of the

alleged activities complained about by

## Page 15

13-00000

CONFIDENTIAL

Novel occurred in 1975 and there is no apparent reason

for Novel having singled out Mr. Osborn as a defendant.

Mr. Jameson also requested traces on two individuals

these individuals.

Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably

be receiving a formal request for pertinent information

as this case develops, but he merely needed a preliminary

reading in order to determine if Mr.. Osborn should be

defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation.

Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to

Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the

undersigned.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM

SUBJECT

John K. Greaney

Associate General Counsel

: Gordon Dwane Novel

1. Gordon Novel is scheduled for prosecution in New Orleans

on 27 October on charges stemming from = conspiracy to firebomb some

buildings on Canal Street. He was mentaned extensively in the James

Garrison investigation of the Kennnedy assassination in 1967. Subse-

quently, Novel filed suit against Garriso= and later against Playboy

Magazine for an article they published wich identified Novel as a CIA

employee. In 1969 the Agency submitted a certificate signed by the then

Director of Personnel, Robert S. Wattles, which certified that Gordon Novel

had never been employed by the CIA (cc=y attached). It may be necessary

to submit a new certificate for the upcoming trial in New Orleans. You

are requested to search your files to determine whether there is any

record of employment.

2. There are two additional defense witnesses that we would

appreciate a search as to any employmer i relationship:

(a) Lawrence B. Rohde

It is my understanding that these names have all been traced as a request

from the Domestic Collection Division with negative results. However, I

would appreciate a written response to those traces by close of business

20 October so that certificates can be prepared.

3. It is possible that a witness from the Office of Personnel may be

required to appear in New Orleans as a rebuttal witness to testify that

there was no employment relationship with Gordon Dwane Novel, but this

is subject to negotiation with the prosecutor.

REFERENCES

: Domestic Collections Division Memoranda

dated 25 February 1976 & 1 March 1976

1.

According to the referenced Domestic Collections

Division (DCD) memoranda, the New Orleans DCD Office had con-

sidered proposals from Subject in October 1975 and on

9 February 1976 which were rejected.

During the last contact,

the DCD representative requested Subject not contact him again.

2. DCD requested Office of General Counsel (OGC) guidance

if they should be contacted by the press concerning Subject's

arrest for conspiring to detonatesincendiary devices in a down-.

town New Orleans building.

OGC recommended that they acknowledge

receiving a proposal from Novel which had been rejected. DCD

was also informed that Subject had never been employed by the

Agency, with the understanding that this might also be made

known to any inquiring reporters or United States Attorney?

DCD stated that

it allowed them

to yes candid to the sedate agueries

and also serves to disassociate the Agency from the difficulties

in which Subject now finds himself.

It appears that the only

action taken in this case is the OGC guidance supplied to DCD

and the only ClA interest in Subject is based on his contact

with the New Orleans DCD Office.

REE

(a) N0-39-76 dated 20 February 1976, Subject: Gordon Novel

(b)

Watts Telecon of 24 February 1976, Same Subject

3

The US Attorney in New Orleans, Gerald Gallinghouse, called

the Hew Orleans Resident Office on 24 February 1276 to advise me that

Gordon M. D. Novel had been arrested by agents of the US Alcohol, Tobacco

and Firearms Bureau (AIY) for conspiring to detonate incendiaxy devices

In a downtown New Orleans building on Mardi Gras, 2 March 1976- Novel

had apparently described such a plot in a conversation he unwittingly

hold with an undercover ire agent.

2. I confirmed to Gallinghouse that I had had a rumber of contacts

with Novel since October 1975 concerning a proposal which lovel had offered

for CIA consideration. : I told Gallinghousa that the proposal had been e

jected by the Agency, but that I had again seen Novel on 9. Februaxy 1976

to accept additional material in support of his proposal.

At that time,

I also asked lovel not to contact me again.. I assured Gallinghouse tbat

at so time had Novel been an Agency employee, not had he ever had any

fornal relationship with the Agency. Gallinghouse thanked me for ex-

plaining the nature of our relationship with Novel, and he suggested

that he might recontact me later 1f necessary for nora details.

3.

In the referent telecon, I briefed the Deputy Chief of Operations,

Ed Watts, on the development and asked him how I should respond lf Galling-

house sought access to the office file on Fovel..

Mr. Watts recommended that

I try to avoid giving the US Attorney direct access to the file, but that

1f Callinghouse should ask to review the file, I should refer the requost

to Headquarters for resolution,

4s. Mrs. Gordon Novel called shortly after my conversation with

Messrs. Gallinghouse and Hatts.

She said that her husband had asked

her to call no to insure that federal autborities vere aware that ber

husband had been actively discussing a proposal for the Agency with me.

kirs. Novel said that her husband had been dented bond, and that he hoped

his contacts with a DCD oîficer might somehow convlnce federal authorities

that he could be safely released on bond after all. Otherwise, she said,

he might be detained through the Mardi Gras holiday as a precaution. She

assured me that Novel had made no effort to persuade the authoritles that

he is a CIA officer or employee.

Also confiscated according to sources,

sj..

Jearned the device was not registered.

"The court documents also claim that

although Novel was unaware Grafton

was an undercover federal agent, he.

tried to hire Grafton for the plan at

$1,600 and a year's free rent in an apart-

ment.

Reportedly, Novel and two other men

were supposed to meet with Gov, Edwin

Edwards last Saturday in Baton Rouge

to discuss the possibilities of getting a

world's fair for New Orleans.

**I had a luncheon scheduled (last)

Saturday at the mansion with some peo-

ple to talk about the exposition," the

governor said.

"But the name Novel

doesn't ring a bell.

"Only one man showed up Saturday.

He said the others couldn't make it and

asked if we could re-schedule the meet-

w: ing. I didn't even ask why thay couldn't

make it.

An aide to the governor said the gover-

nor's office was trying to determine if

one of the three men was Novel.

He said records of the appointment

show only the time and subject matter of

the meeting.

The aide added that Novcl may have

been one of the three, but he could not be

certain.

According to the documents, the ATF

Bureau received information "from a

confideritial informant" of the alleged

plan.

Grafton, posing as a prospective "hit

man," made arrangements to discuss

the plans with Novel on Feb. 4

The affidavit for a; search warrant

signed by Johannesen … said Grafton

was told by Novel that Novel "had

several buildings he wanted destroyed in

the New Orleans, La. area...

The papers also show that on Feb. 6,

Grafton met Novel at Novel's home, 1718

Lakeshore Drive, where Novel allegedly

said "he had made a firebomb for an

individual to burn the first building he

wanted destroyed, but that man failed to

do the job.

The identity of that person was not re-

vealed in the documents.

Novel said he "had a few problems,

with some of the property located within

the (downtown) project area and that

wa's where Grafton would come

in . ..,

" according to the affidavit.

The documents showed that Grafton

met Novel again al his Plaza Tower of.

fice on Feb. I1d the two "discussed

the firebombin

five buildings within

the downtown area.

At that time, according to the docu-

ments, Novel allegedly showed Gratton

the equipment as well as what Novel

supposedly described as "'legal wire-

tapping equipment:"

At that meeting, the papers claim.

Novel allegedly agreed to give Graiton

"the contract"' to destroy the live bulld-

ings:

That same day, the documents indi-

cate. Novel supposedly pointed out the

first building targeted for the alleged at-

tack, and later look Gralton to "the

building located beiween St. Charles and

Camp Street."

According to the papers. Novel al.

legedly explained to Grafton

"how

difficult it would be to get Inside the

building:

At another meeting Feb. 13 between

the two in Novel's office, the documents

said, Novel drew a diagram of the first

targeted building which was described

as being "accross the street from One

Shell Square."

Presumably, that building was the

•On that same date, the records allege,

Novel told Grafton "the fire should be on

the second floor in order for the roof and

floor to burn completely."

It was then, according to the affidavit,

that Grafton agreed to the plan for 51,000

and the free apartment.

Accurding to the records. Novel also

presanted Grafton a nelebook, contain.

ing "a plan project of approximalely

three Blocks near the One Sheil Square

Building" which was also to be part of

the alleged scheme.

After their series of meetings Novel

was arrested by the ATF agents Feb: 20.

Novel was denied bail the next day

and the gavernment - led by Asst. U.S.

Atty. Al Winters - was granted a mo.

tion that Novel be examined by a psy

chiatristio determine his competency in

the proceedings.

Defense attorney Servando C.

Municipel Court Judge Eddic Sapir, has

urged that bond be set for his client.

CLV-121-75

DATE: 17 July 1975

1. On 15 July 1975, an agent of the Cleveland FBI contacted the

Cleveland Resident Office concerning the attached correspondence. The

Bureau had received the letters the same day, and because there were

several references to the Agency, the agent thought that our office

should be informed. Copies of the correspondence are attached for

your information and retention.

The FBI agent who discussed this matter with us stated that

he had been told that the author of the four-page letter was a

"professional wiretapper", had previously been convicted to transporting

Illegal wiretap equipment across state lines (into Nevada), and was

suspected of illegally obtaining and

selling "classified information".

Cleveland

FBI plans no action at this time other than further in-

vestigatory work on the individual.

The Cleveland RO plans to do absolutely nothing about this

matter other than forwarding the information to Headquartexs:

agent was informed of and agreed to this course of action, he was

thanked for his concern and the matter was dropped,

- Dear Me. Doherty:

Enclosed is a Xerox copy of a letter received by special

messenger on July 1, 1975, from Gordon Novel, making cextain demands

on Southwestern Bell, AT&T and companies serving Colunbus, Ohzo, Rero,

Nevada and Washington, D. C. (See page 4; paragraph 3)

Mi. Novel's letter has been reviewed by our company Legal

Department and a decision has been made not to reply in writing.

Mx. Horak, the

manager handling Novel's account, "is to contact Novel

and advise him verbally that his letter has been referred to higher

management; and that copies of this letter have been forwarded to

the telephone companies serving the cities he mentioned for any

action they deem

appropriate. MI. Novel's propensity for filing

suit was one of the main considerations for choosing this course of

action.

Should any of the recipients of this letter decide tö

contact or write Novel I would appreciate being notified prior to

your doing 50. Our: Legal Department wants. to be kept abreast of any

response made to his demands as it might affect the company's. course

of action.

very truly yours,

Enclosuie

Gentlemen:

Due to the rapidly accelerating national

sensitivity

of my historical personal interests, as well as the

magnitude of political, intelligence and financial involve-

ments for which I am legally responsible to ny associates,

I deen it wise to contaci your office for the following

rcasons:

It 1s inperative that your files be revised in order

to case reflecting purposeful disinformation, slanderous

Irregularities and obvious inconsistencies about my activities.

This data has been maliciously accunulated by your business

and security. offices during tho past seven years while

Illegally, Intruding and Interfering In highly sensitive

Industrial and political counterintelligence research in

which I was involved. To accomplish this, 1.

T.& 1. has

used misrepresentation and a

fraudulent legal technicality

covering

anticipated" financial loss to the phone company.

(My phone bills have always been paid promptly.).

The police tactics used by your offices--harrassnent,

Intimidation,

threats, extortionary denands- have been

verified throughout jexas and in Washington, D. C. however,

the highly sensitive nature of the work in which we are

currently Involved could, concelvably, pose a threat to

naitonal security because of this invasion of privacy where

our phone calls are concerned.

Relative to the recent meeting in my private study

records and do not rind a willing for direct actionle dement

of the R. B McMasters billing responsibility, alleged by

Mr. Horak In his letter of the same date, written on plain

watermarked stationery bearing questionable signature.

That purportedly official telephone company document claims

that I owe your company $1, 041.42.

for the reason that Mr. McMasters personally effected the

installation of the phone at 3055 Leahy (243-6382), In his

name and as an officer of the now-defunct Genesis Corpora-

tion.

I have caused approximately $20,000 to be paid to

Mr.

Mcmasters, privately and corporately. dor ats unsuccess

ful business vertures and I have no intention of assuning

responsibility for something else i do not owe in Mr.

McMasters behalf. He and the Genesis Corporation were.

personally and corporately responsible for the bills for

that phone and I am certain your records will reflect same.

My records reflect that hundreds of

vindictive;

aspararing and slanderous lon distance teleohone calle

were placed by your company's collection operators alleging

that I did owe the bill.

These calls caused me and my

associates severe personal and financial damages. demand

that the mistake be corrected in wilting. I will furnish

you the list of names and addresses.

"The NBC broadcast of June 19, 1967" put on by Walter Sheridan "will probably stand for

vears as a symbol of the lengths to which some powerlul outside interests will go in order

to interfere with state government."

Walter Sheridan has recently been hired by the

Democratic National Committee to head their investi

gation of the Watergate bugging caper. In view of

the importance of this assignment,

worthwhile to examine Mr. Sheridan's performance in

pait investigations.

"Getting" Hoffa, and False Testimony

Walter Sheridan first came into national promi

rence in 1961 when he spearheaded Robert Kennedy's

drive against Jimmy Hoffa, duxing Robert's tenure

as Attorney General. Sheridan pursued a relentless,

no mercy shown, course of action to

"get Hoffa", and

get him he did.

In the course of this crusade, some

rather dubious techniques. were used; which later

The Watergate Incident

On June 17 at 2:30 a.m., five men were

arrested in the offices of the Democratic

National Committee in the Watergate Hotel;

Washington. D.C.

They had broken into the

office, and were found with electronic sur-

veillance devices, cameras for photographing

documents, etc: they were wearing surgical

rubber gloves.

They were arrested by police.

These five men were James. W. McCord, Jr.,

Bernard L. Barker,

Frank Sturgis, Eugenio R.

Mariinez, and

Virgilio R. Gonzales.

Their connections reach to the Republican

The prime example

was the

"uncovering" of a key witness against lloffa,

program, broadcast on June 19, 1967, was a highly

biased, provably dishonest, personally vindictive,

attack on Garrison defending Shaw. The Shaw trial*

a half later.

the principal examples:

after the assassination and asked him to represent

stories about Clay Bertrand that the truth was dif

Clay Bertrand and whether he was Clay Shaw. Andrews

said Bertrand was actually Eugene C. Davis, a bar

up in his face when Davis denied the shole thing.

Cancler was called before

Cancler again took the

guilty of contempt of court and

Apparently Sheridan had

paid him a lot more than $500.

Two weeks later

Cancler was handed a third convinction and sentenced

-to eighteen years as a multiple offender.

Miguel Torres was also brought before a grand

jury and took the fifth when he was asked,

NBC in June 1967, concerning the district attorney,

James Alcock, Garrison's assistant district ai-

torney who handled the Shaw trial, saidto the judge,

"Toxres and Cancier just tell the television and

Walter Sheridan about it.. When they have an oppor

cunity to do something they take the fifth amendment."

Sheridan Could Not Get Russo to "'Cooperate"

Sheridan himself appeared on screen to discuss

Perry Russo. He

could never get Russo to change

his mind and cooperate, so Sheridan interpreied for

the audience what Russo had told him. He stated

that Russo told him that his testimony against Shaw

may be a combination of truth, fantasy and lies.

Andrew Sciambro, Garrison's assistant district

Garrison, detailing #alter Sheridan's efforts to

Bribing and Attempting to Bribe Witnesses

In addition to bribing and attempting to bribe

witnesses, Sheridan also had meetings with one of

Garrison's part-time investigators, William Gur-

vich. Garrison found out about the meetings and

did not give Gurvich all of the information he

wanted.

Jim Garrison said about Sheridan and the NBC

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical

Computers and Automation, established 195l and

therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-

puters and data processing, believes that the pro-

fession of information engineer includes not only

competence in handling information using computers.

and other means, but also a broad responsibility.

in a professional and engineering sense. for:

The reliability and social significance

of pertinent input data;

- The social value and truth of the

output results.

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-

fessional responsibility for the reliability and

significance of the data he uses, and the safety

and efficiency of the bridge le builds, for human

beings to rist their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes

from time to

time articles and other information

related to socially useful input and output of data

systems in a broad sense. To this end se seek to

publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical

- but productive of thought and an improved and

safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which

our children and later generations may have a fu

ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engincer needs to

relate his engineering to the most important and

most serious problems in the world today:

nuclear «capons, pollution, the population explo

sion, and many more.

CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM

RELEASE IN FULL 1998

SOURCE:

Numerous news Items, the

latest did in October 1967.

OS INDICES RESULES:

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March

1967 when CARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with

a burglary of a munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together

with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left

New Orleans, first going to McLean, Virginia where he

lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective.

See summary

on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial

claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's promimity to

McLean, Va.

After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967

a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink

drainboard. by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy

friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in

turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-HEM; Hoke MAY.

SLON

Hoke MAY was granted a Covert Security Approval in April 1958

for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly

employed by EJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his

position with a provate firm which handled work for the Project.

The letter was presumably written to a "Mr. WEISS" in CIA and referred

to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVET claimed

he was involved. This matter was reviewed by CI/R&A at the time the

matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE-CHEK

was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to

the widows of American flyers who participated in the Bay of Pigs.

No connection with NOVEL could be established. NOVEL knew Sergio

ARCACHA-SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario

Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti Castro organization.

Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEl could have gained

an impression from him that he was employed by CIA.

In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from arrest by GARRISON

on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned to Louisiana to

testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe

on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana.

DELATIS:

The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker.

However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana

and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was

one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with

Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony

before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967, that Colonel BURBANK

was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that

BURBANK and NOVEL, knew each other.

BURBANK testified that every Louisiana

sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel

#526113

1. On 20 May 1969, the Director of Security advised that

he had received a call from Mi. Bienvenu, Director of Security,

National Security Agency, regarding a possible impersonation

by Subject. According to Mr. Biehvenu, an ex-Federal Bureau of

Investigation agent, Mr. Busself 1. Aufrance, 3256 South Union

Avenue, Alliance, Ohio, 44601,

had called Mr. Mathison and

advised that a contact of his had

stated that Subject had shown a

CIA credential and indicated that he was employed by the Agency.

Mr. Aufrance advised he called the National Security Agency to

bring this matter to the attention of the highest security officials

in Washington and that if anyone wished to contact him they should

call him before 5:00 p.m., this date.

2. After reviewing Subject's file and confirming that Mr.

Aufrance was an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, I briefed

the Director of Security who requested that I call Mr. Aufrance and

advise him that we were knowledgeable of Subject and that on other

occasions he had inferred he was employed by CIA. In addition, that

we intended to turn this information over to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation for investigation since the FBI had jurisdiction on such

impersonation cases.

3.

I later briefed Mr. Fred J. Cassidy, FBI/Liaison, who

suggested that I advise Mr. Aufrance to report the information to

local FBI agents.

In MI. Cassidy's presence, I called Mr. Aufrance

who repeated what he had told Mr. Mathison.

He also stated that

Subject's wife is now separated from him and is suing him for divorce

in Columbus, Ohio.

She has stated that Subject is armed, carries a

tear gas weapon and some kind of a .22 caliber pistol, concealed as a

fountain pen. She stated that Subject is leaving Columbus for Reno,

Nevada, where he intends to open a gambling establishment. In further

discussion with Mr. Aufrance, he indicated his source was a friend of

Subject's wife and from other statements he made, it is believed that his

source is Thomas F. Hughes, Jr., who was interviewed by the Chicago

Field Office on 18 April 1969.

4. After further discussion with Mr. Aufrance during which he

indicated he was leaving for a fishing trip in Canada and would not

return until Sunday, 25 May 1969, it was agreed that he would contact

the local Federal Bureau of Investigation and brief them regarding

Subject and that I would, meanwhile, alert FBI Headquarters/Washington,

which could follow-up with the local office.

5. I then provided Mr. Cassidy with all pertinent information

regarding Mr. Aúfrance's telephone call and all information on Subject.

MI. Cassidy will'keep us advised.

phonetic spelling; however, Headquarters, after an indices

check, later said that it was probably Gordon NOVEL, who

had previously owned a bar in New Orleans and who had

previously claimed an affiliation with the Agency):

Gordon NOVEL and it

may have a bearing on the recent evente

In the Playboy Club in Chicago. Abbey has also worked

at Playboy Clubs in New Orleans, Cincinnati, London and other

places. A few years ago, Abbey married NOVEL, whom she met

made their home in the Columbus, Ohio area. They have had

a lot of fights and arguments and have been separated on

sovera! occasions, Abbey has filed for a divorce. Presently,

Abbey is living in Columbus with her parents, the John

MULLIGANS

18, Mr. HUGHES further related that NOVEL lives by his

wits and is not to be trusted; that NOVEL engages in

"private

oye" work of questionable practices; that he (NOVEL) reportedly

taps telophones,

"bugs" rooms and takes photographs, all of

which are in connection with questionable activities; and that

NoveL, In the past, according to Abbey, has claimed working

19. Mr • HUGHES further related that he has no romantic

SUBSHOT:

GIGAS, Chris

Subjoct in identified as e California Investigator who administered

a polygraph test to Edgar Eugene FRADLEY who has been charged with conspiracy

by GARRISON.

Subject was born 12 August 1921 at Omabe, Hebraska. He 1s a former

Agency employee who BOD in October 1949 as a GS-9 Intelligence Officer.

Subject resigned his staff statue in February 1951 and becano a staff

agent with Projact FID MORPH 1D Turkey from March 1951 until July 1952-

(Ela Vite Anne Claudia QUOAS nee SETARO vas granted a covert security clearance

1n February 1952 for use in a clerical capacity in the Middle East.)

In his ancienment with Project SIDOMORPHin Turkey, Subject was a

source of constant embarrasement in fle contacte with Turkish police]&

officiale. He was boastful; indiscreet, lacking in sound judement, knew

Ilttle or nothing In the fields In wich he ve self professedly an expert

and we guilty of security breaches in falllag to maintain hie cover..

in one Lncident he made recommendations of police reorganizations to be

made by province governors in Turkeys versas, In Turkey, tbe Police S

Department 1s a national orgenization and not subject to the dictates of

the provlace governors.

This caused nuch 111 w11l and Iriction with the

Turkish police.

Subject professed to be an expert in bia knowledge or the polyeraph

mohtne and claimed he had tuo years' expertence sith the los Angeles

Police Department prior to his employment with the Agency. However, 1+

was developed that Instead of this claimed experience, he had actually

spent one or two weeks in a detective school connected with the los Angeles

Police Depertuent where he received belor average grades.

In October 1952 he approached an Agency employee regarding a new.

typo of technical eguipment and thie conversation led to the dioclosure

by Subject that he was smployed by the ngoney In a covert capacity; that

he was teaching lle detection techniques to foreign police departmonts

without bolng authorized or competent to do so.

Subject was briefed 1n

December 1952 with stress placed on the importance of living up to his

security responsibilitles and exercising utmost precaution in protecting

the covert intereste of the Agency.

In spite of the strong warninge given him 10 this Interview, Subject

again becane Involved in an Incident of official embarrassment to the Agency.

In March 1953 he misreprenented himself as a polygraph operator with the

"State Department Secret Police!

• This mierepresentation was made at a

time when the Departuent of State was not authorized to have a polygraph

machine and Congressional legislation was pending at the time regarding

such authorization. An a result of this misrepresentation, subject vas

afforded another security interview In March 1953-

He explained that

his cover company sold equiment to foreign countries through the Mutual

Ald Progran and supplied consultant services to the State Department but

Subject denied that be ever represented himself an a State Department

polygraph operator. After the security Interview Subject was also assessed

by an Agency psychologlot (March 1953) and vas found to be egotiatical,

emotionally unstable, possensed of a need to baild himself up ta the

eyes of others ond gave either exaggerated or completely erroneous

Information as to his past positions. Els Intelligence quotient was foind

to be comparatively. lon in relation to thome of other gancy employees.

In Apr1l 1953 termination of his employment was recommended.

Jub,ject ronigned 29 April 1953 "to nocept a ponition in Callfornia.

that he was responsible for supplying the classifled information to HARRELSON

about ENDONORPE Jectivities.

Leonard HARRILSON 18 a private Inveetigator pecializing in hypnotion

In 196% he was employed by the Keeler

HARRELSON 18 belleved to be a person of poor morals. He was given

a medical dlecharge from the Army as a psychoneurotic in 1949 and had been

court martlaled twice for Impersonating non-commissioned officers of a

rank higher than he possessed. In his bustness partnership with FURR,

man, who stoutly denies participating in a plot to kill

Kennedy, was managing director of the International Trade

Rome, carried a story. Which said shaw is a director of a

firm known as
