MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel

Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13: August 1981.
Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls
forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone
number. When the call was’ answered with the Houston number, Novel indi-
cated that he was calling the New Orleans office. He was told that Farris
was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to
Houston. Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency
file under the Freedom of Information Act. He was told ‘that he should
address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request.
He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent
to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make
sense of it. He did, however, discover. that it contained information that
was erroneous and he asked how to go about refuting the misinformation
and/or correcting the file. It was.suggested that he write a letter
detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made. He did
not seem interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of
questioning. He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of
the Agency directly. .He was told that he should use the local represent-
ative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the
Director. Novel indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but
was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information
mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified
representative of the Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding
information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a. small
sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about that," then hung up.”

29 April 1977

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

FROM : Raymond M. Reardon
SUBJECT :. Pending Litigation - Gordon Novel
1. Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure

who first came to the attention of this Agency during the

. Garrision Investigation into the assassination of
-President Kennedy. ~From time to time he has claimed.to

be a CIA employee or.to be acting on behalf of the CIA.
He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no
contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits to
Domestic Collection Division offices. He has been in
several scrapes with the law, most recently in October
1976 when he was on trial for conspiracy. to: firebomb
several buildings in New Orleans. Mr. Novel has now |,
filed a civil.suit-claiming alleged violations of his
rights and interference with his personal affairs. He

is not suing..the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard
Osborn as a defendant. Mr. Osborn has been in touch with
the Office of.General Counsel seeking representation by _
the Justice Department since he feels his being named in”
the suit probably resulted from his official duties with
the Agency. aie

2. On. 27 April 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the
Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to

inquire whether we had a-file on Novel and if the file

showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named

Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit. Mr. Jameson was
given a rundown: on the nature of the information in
Novel's file and was also provided with Mr. Osborn's
retirement date, 26—-Februer1974. Mr. Jameson mentioned
that most of Ge activities complained about by

Idee D4

E2 IMPDET
CL BY 007472


13-00000

Novel occurred in 1975 and there is no apparent reason
for Novel having singled out Mr. Osborn as a defendant.
Mr. Jameson also requested traces on two individuals
who are alloged oO have been involved in this matter--
‘a a gek. Phi ft He. was advised
d.of either of —

these individuals.

3. Mr. Jameson. indicated that we would probably
be receiving a formal request for pertinent information Be
as this case develops, but he merely needed.a preliminary
reading in order to determine if Mr.. Osborn should be
defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation.
Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to
Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the
undersigned. : |

1. Reference is made te your 20 October 1976 priority
request (OGC 76-5787) which asks that the Office of Security
search its indices to determine if any of the above-named
individuals have ever been employed by the Agency. Reference

1976: confirming that none of these individusls have ever. been
employed by the Agency.

Y
2,. This memorandum will serve to confirm the referenced

; telephonic response, Office of Security indices contaia no

record in the uame of Lawrenee B, Rohde, which was also searched
in the variation of Lawrence B. Rhode. The Gffice of Security

dees naintain files on Gordon wane Novel and Alien Ds “Selly “JIrsy°-

and a brief sunmary of the infermation contsined within these
files appears below: ane

a. Gordon Dvane Novel, SF#S26 115

Hr. Novel has a long history of leaving the
impression that he is either employed by or asso-
ciated with the CIA. Nr. Novel has not, however,
ever been an employee of the Agency in any capacity.
The Office of Security file on Mr. Novel was
established in 1967 by virtue of his involvement
with the Garrison investigation of the assassination
of President Kennedy,. During the ensuing period

Agency with various proposals, none of which have:
been followed-up by the Agency. Most recently,
Mr. Novel was=in contact with the Domestic Collec-
tion Division (DCD) in New Orleans, Lowisiana,

in October 1975 and February 1976 to volunteer
various proposals. Mr, Novel's proposals were
rejected by DCD, and Mr. Novel was requested to
refrain from future contact with that office,

b. Allen D, Bell, Jr.s, SFE648 216

Nr. Bell is President of Dektor Counter-
intellf gente and Security, Incorporated,
Springfield, Virginia, and has appeared widely
in the aews media as a “wiretapping expert,"
mest recently in connection with the Watergate
hearings, Mr. Bell has never been employed by
the Agency. The Office: ef Security file on
Mr, Bell was established in 1970 based on a
request from the Technical Security. Division,
Directorate of Operations (TS) for a Contact
Security Approval, Cited approval was granted
in November 1971, aithough Hr, Bell's file dogs
not reflect.the specific purpose for the request
nor if Mr. Beli was actually contacted,: Mr, Bell
was. also of interest to DCD in October 1973;
however, the specific purpose of this interest
is kot contained within Mr," Bell's file.

3. As indicated, a review of our records failed ‘to disclose
any indication that Mrs.Nevel, Mr, Rohde, or Mr. Bell have ever
been employed by the Agency in any capacity.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
Director of Person=el

FROM : John K, Greaney
: Associate General Counsel

SUBJECT : Gordon Dwane Novel

1. Gordon Novel is scheduled for zrosecution in New Orleans
on 27 October on charges stemming from 2 conspiracy to firebomb some
buildings on Canal Street. He was ment=ned extensively in the James
Garrison investigation of the Kennnedy assination in 1967. Subse-
quently, Novel filed suit against Garriso= and later against Playboy
Magazine for an article they published which identified-Novel as a CIA
employee. In 1969 the Agency submitted = certificate signed by the then
Director of Personnel, Robert S. Wattles, which certified that Gordon Novel
had-never been employed by the CIA (cczy attached). It may be necessary
to submit a new certificate for the upcoming trial in New Orleans. You
are requested to search your files to dete>mine whether there is any
record of employment.

2. There are two additional defense witnesses that we would
appreciate a search as to any employmext relationship:
oS

(a) Lawrence B, Rohde
530 "N" Street, S.W.
Washington, D.C.
Employed by: Commonwealth Pug Corporation

A

(b) Allan D. Bell, Jr. ,
President, DEKTOR C.i.S. Incorporated
5054 Blue Ridge Avente
Annandale, Virginia

OS 6 4555



It is my understanding that these names have all been traced as a request
from the Domestic Collection Division with negative results. However, I
would appreciate a.written response to those traces by close of business
20° October so that certificates can be prepared.

3. Itis possible that a witness from the Office of Personnel may be
required to appear in New Orleans as a rebuttal witness to testify that
there was no employment relationship with Gordon Dwane Novel, but this
is subject to negotiation with the prosecutor.

REFERENCES : Domestic Collections Division Memoranda

dated 25 February 1976 & 1 March 1976

1. According to the referenced. Domestic Collections

Division (DCD) memoranda, the New Orleans ‘DCD .Office had -con-

sidered proposals: .from Subject in October 1975 and on
9 February 1976 which were rejected. During the last contact,
the DCD representative requested Subject not‘contact him again.

2. DCD requested Office of General.Counsel (OGC) guidance
if they should be contacted by the press. concerning Subject's
arrest for conspiring to detonatesincendiary devices in a. down-
town New Orleans building. OGC recommended that they acknowledge
receiving a-proposal from Novel which had been rejected. DCD
was also informed that Subject had never been employed by the
Agency, with the understanding that this might also be: made
known to any inquiring reporters or United States“ Attorneyy
DCD stated that they were pleased with this guidance, since
itsallowed them to respond candidly to any immediate inquiries
and also servés to disassociate the sAgency from the difficulties
in which Subject now finds himself. It appears that the only
action taken in this.case is the OGC guidance supplied to DCD
and the only CIA interest in Subject is based on his contact
with the New Orleans DCD Office. e

1. ‘The WS Attorney. in New Orleans, Gerald Gallinghouse, called
-leans..Resident Office on:.24:February..1976, to..advise.methat

D. Novel had been arrested by agents of the US Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms Bureau (ATF) for. conspiring to datonate incendiary devices
in a downtown Hew Orleans building on Mardi Gras; 2 March 1976.: Novel
had apparently described such a plot in a conversation he unwittingly
held with on undercover ATF agent.

2.. I confirmed to Gallinghouse that I had had a number of contacts. ve
with Novel since October. 1975 concerning a proposal which Novel had offered
for CIA consideration. . I teld Gallinghouse that the proposal had been ra~
jected by the Agency, but that I had again seen:Novel ‘on 9 February 1976
to accept additional material in support of his proposal. At that time,
I alse asked Novel not to contact me again. L.assured Gallinghouse that
at no time had Novel been an Agency employee, nor had he ever had any
: £ormal relationship with the Agancy.. Gallinghousa thanked me for ex
plaining the nature. of our relationship with Novel, and he suggested.
that he mlght recontact me later if necessary for. more details.

3. In the referent telecon, I briefed the Deputy Chief of Operations,
Ed Watts, on the development and asked him how I should respond if Galling-

involved i in an ‘,enormous project” with.
‘a gentleman in the Defense.

“~ Asked if the “fenormous project” was
‘linked to his arrest, Novel said, “Well,
something i is behind this. I think I know
what it is but I veould rather not say.”
"Novel, identified as a financial.con-
sultant with the;Langford Land Co. here

He said he has been “deeply involved”

the past, but did not elaborate:

“I Know enough. about the intelligence
community to one day play a major po-
litical role i init,” Novel said. .

_IN'1963, Garrison aéctised ‘Novel of
conspiring with a Cuban refugee to steal

explosives from an oi] company storage:
site. Garrison's investigation linked Lee
Harvey Oswald, the President's accused
assassin, ‘with a vaguely defined Cuban
liberation movement.

The.-complaint against Novel-claims
that’ when the defendant was arrested
last week, he was in possession of “an
incendiary device,” consisting of a can
of aleohol, balloons, a can of black pow-
der. timed fuses.and other equipment.

Also confiscated. according to sources,
were maps and diagrams of the. build-
ings to be hit:

“although Novel was. unaware, Grafton

was an undercover federal agent, he.

tried to. hire Grafton for the plan at
$1,000 and a year's free rent in ‘an apar
ment. poeta

Reportedly, Novel and two other men
were supposed to meet'with Gov, Edwin
Edwards last Saturday in Baton Rouge
to discuss the possibilities of getting a
world’s fair for New Orleans.

“J had-a luncheon scheduled (last)
Saturday atthe mansion with some peo-
ple to talk about the exposition,”the
governor said, “But the name Novel
doesn't ring'a bell. : fs

“Only one man showed up Saturday.
He said the others couldn't make it and”

” asked if we could re-schedule the meet-
ing. I didn't even.ask- why they couldn't
makeit.’..” qi

* An aide to the governor said the gover
{SS nor’s office was trying. to determine if
~" one of the three men was Novel.

2 He said records ‘of the appointment
3, ‘show only the time and subject matter of
2— the meeting.

‘The’ aide’ added that Novel may have
been one of the three, but he could not be
certain. oe

According ‘to the documents, the ATF

“; Buréaii received information “from a

*" confideritial informant” of the alleged
.. plan. : oe

. Grafton, posing as a prospective ‘hit
:.. man,” made arrangements to discuss
the plans with Novel on Feb. 4. .

‘The affidavit for a, search warrant. — ©

_c) signed-by Johannesén — said Grafton

was told by-Novel that Novel “had*
4 several buildings he wanted destroyed in
the New Orleans, La. area. . ...""

‘The papers.also show that on Feb. 6,”
Grafton met Novel at Novel's home, 1718
Lakeshore Drive, where Novel ailegedly
t* said ‘thé had made. a firebomb for an

individual to. burn :the. first building he
"wanted destroyed, but that man failed to ~
dothe job... .” :
i* . The identity of that person was not re-
*~ vealed in the documents.

Novel said-he “had a few problems,
_ with some of the property located within
- the: (downtown) project area and-that
was where-Grafton would come
according to the affidavit.
The documents showed that Grafton

met Novel age
fice on Feb. 11d the: two “discussed
the firebombin|,  . five bui s within
the downtown area.” *

At that time, according to the docu-

ments, Novel allegedly showed Grafton
the equipment as well as what Novel
supposetily. described as “illegal wire-
tapping equipment.”
.-At that meeting, the papers claim,
Novel allegedly agreed to give Grafton
“the contract” lo destroy the five build-
ings.

‘That same day, the documents indi-
cate, Novel supposedly pointed out the
first building targeted Jor the alleged at-
tack, and later took Grafton to-*‘the.
building lonaied between St. Charles and
Camp Street."” :

According to the papers,-Novel al-

salegedly explained to Grafton “‘how

difficult if Would be to get inside'tire”
building." 3

‘At another ineeting Feb. 13 between.
the two in Novel's office, the documents
said, Novel drew a diagram ofthe first
targeted building which was described
as being “accross the street from One
Shell Square."” :

Presumably. that building was the
Greater Federation of Churches Build-

ing.
a "on fhat same date, the records allege,
Novel fold Grafton “the fire shoutd ke on
the second floor in order for the roof and
floor to burn completely.” :
Tt was then, according to the affidavit,
that Grafton agreed to-the plan for $1,600.
and the free apartment.
‘Accarding to. the records, Novel also

presartted Grafton a notebook, contain-.

ing “a plan project, of -approximately

three biacks near the One Sheil Square”

Building™ which Was also to be part of
the alleged scheme.

‘After Sheir series of meetings Novel
Was arrested by the ATF agents Feb. 20.

Novel was denied bail the next day
and the government — led by Asst. U.S.
Atty.-Al Winters. — was. granted amo-
tion that Novel be examined by a psy-
chiatrist te determine his competency in
the proceedings.

Defense. attorney Servando C.

“Sonny” Garcia III ~ a law partner of"

Municipal Court Judge Eddie Sapir, has
urged that bond be set for his client...

“The NBC broadcast of June 19, 1967" put on by Walter Sheridan “will probably stand for
years as @ symbol of the lengths to which some powerful outside interests will go in order .
: to interfere with state government.”

Walter Sheridan has recently been hired by the
Democratic National Committee to head their investi-
gation of the Watergate bugging caper. In view of
the importance of this assignment, it would seem
worthwhile to examine Mr. Sheridan's performance in
puct investigations.

“Getting” Hoffa, and False Testimony oe

Walter Sheridan first: came into ‘national promi-
sence in 1961 when he spearheaded Robert Kennedy's
drive against Jimmy Hoffa, during Robert's ‘tenure
as Attorney General. “Sheridan pursued a relentless,
no mercy: shown, course-of action to “get Hoffa", and
get him he did.’ In the course of this crusade, some
rather dubious techniques. were used, which later

‘The Watergate Incident

‘On June 17 at 2:30-a.m., five men: were
" arrested in the offices of the Democratic
National Committee in the Watergate Hotel,
Washington, D.C: They had broken into the
office, and were found with electronic sur-
véillance devices, cameras for photographing
documents, ete: they. were wearing: surgical
tubber gloves. They: were arrested by police.

These five men were James W. McCord, Jr.,
Bernard L. Barker, Frank Sturgis, Eugenio R.
Martinez, and Virgilio R. Gonzales.

cl Their connections reach to the Republican
* rty, the Committee to Re-Elect the Presi-
nt, President Richard M. Nixoa, the Central
Intebligence Agency, and other persons and
organizations.

rning in August 1972, "Computers and
fon" nas been publishing articles on

ate Incident and its ramifications,
because'of the threat. that this ineident rep-
democracy in the United States,

riance of seeking the truth about
and pinning down the responsibility for it.

ame back to haunt dir. Sheridan, The: prime “example
was the “uncovering” ofa key witness against Mloffa,
one Grady Partin of New Orleans and Baton Rouge,

Louisiana, Partin was some years later accused by
(/a grand jury of giving folse testimony against

Hoffa. :

: “Getting” Garrison

bir. Sheridan's most notable performance came in

+ 1967 and '68when he was an executive producer for

NBC-TV news. Sheridan produced a one-hour. NBC spe-
cial on Jim Garrison's investigation: of the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy and the trial of Clay
Shaw for conspiracy to murder the President. The
program, broadcast on June 19, 1967, was a highly
biased, provably dishonest, personally vindictive,
attack on Garrison defending Shaw:-The Shaw tria
did not take place until February, 1969, 2, year and
a half later.

Arrest by Garrison and Indictment by Grand Jury

. Walter Sheridan was arrested’ by Garrison-on
July 7, 1967, following the NGC Special, and in-
dicted by a grand jury on two counts. The first

was. attempted bribery and intimidation-of. a witness.
Rick Townley of ‘station NOSU, the NBC affiliate in
New Orleans, was arrested and indicted with Sheridan
on the same charges. -The federal government, es-
pecially the Justice Department, made sure, that Gar-
rison was never able to bring Sheridan and Townley
totrial. The indictments are still open.

If the Sheridan trial ever does take place, the
conviction should not be too difficult. Here are
the facts, as reported by both New Orleans newspa~
pers, the Times Picayune and the States Item, in
1967 and summarized in “The Kennedy Conspiracy” by
Paris Flammonde, dleredith Press, 1969.

Sheridan and Townley, having been assigned by
NBC to cover the Garrison-Shaw case. became person-
ally and directly involved. The indictments for
bribery, suppressing and altering evidence, and in-
terfering with the trial, did not begin to tell the
ventire story. ADC top management, Frank McGee, the
narrator of the special, and others at NUC, fully

\



ed ups
and. fakes

eridan, until, ic of thé Lies, bribes
the pragram. were revealed.

Apology by NSC for Lies Told by Two “Witnesses”

Kk McGee later had to apologize on AUC. for

es. told by two of Sheridan's “witnesses” on’ the
uspecial, Sheridan and Townley paid them to give
Statements against Garrison. ‘The FCC ruled that
NIC had to give Garrison equal time .ofter Garrison
nade au appeal, because the special had not been a
news programa, -but on NIC-Sheridan vendetta against.
Garrison. > NSC did give Garrison 30 minutes (the”
special was one hour) to respond et -@ later date in
51967.

To isiustrate Sheridan's ond NUC's ‘techniques in
the case, at one point the President of NOC helped
in the. bribery efforts -by ng tir. Gherlock, head
Equitable Life Insurance Co. in New York. . Gher-
lock was asked. for assurance that Perry Russo, who
worked for Equitable in Louisiana, would cooperate
th NIC on the Garrison special. Russo was the
“key witness in the Shaw triel’ whom Sheridan and

. Gtivities in New Orleans prior to the assassination,
along with the strange actions of David Ferrie, ‘on
the day of the assassination, attracted Garrison's
attention.
but a curious newspaper reporter named Rosemary
James’ broke’ the story after a few months of effort.
Clay Shaw's other. identity, Clay Bertrand, had al=
ready been uncovered by Garrison, and his iavolve-
ment in the planning fot the assassination had el
ready been suspected by early 1967.

\Party in David Ferrie's Apartment

Perry Russo’ attended o party in David Ferrie's
apartment where Clay Bertrand, Ferrie, someone re-
sembling Lee Harvey Oswald and others- had. discussed
the possibility: of assassinating President Kennedy.
He became the key witness when Garrison arrested
Shaw on March 1, 1967, and.a grand jury indicted
Shaw on March 22 following two hearings on.Narch 14
and Morch 17 by a three judge panel and a four judge
panel, reconmending that Shaw beheld for trial.

Effort to. Have Russo Change His Testimony

Shetidan and Townley both made up their minds,
along with most of the news media and the Justice
Department, that Garrison had. to be stopped at all
costs. They decided to reslly go to work'on Perry
Russo, since his testimony was all important.

Townley tried to get Russo to change his testi-
mony at the Shaw trioi to make it scem that Garrison
hod hypnotized ‘him and had then asked him leading
questions to get Russo-to testify against Shaw.
Townley and Sheridan went to Russo's house, his of-
fice, and met him at other places. They badgered
hict and attempted’ to bribe him. They pressured ond
threatened him, They used every trick in-the book
to try to get him to. change his testimony.

They threatencd him with being discredited, made
to scem insane, and perhaps fired from his job. They
offered him a chance to work closely, for high re-
wards, with NOC in Sheridan's all-out effort to get
Garrison, Sheridan’ told Russo, “We're going to de-

his testimony. te told {ttsso that-his employer-had ©
promised NBC that no retaliation would be taken
ayainst Russo if’ he cooperated, with NBC.. However,
he might be fired if he didn’t cooperate.

Sheridan told Russo that ABC could set him up in.
California where Russo always wanted to live, if he
helped bust up the Garrison probe. Sheridan: said
NOC would pay. his expenses to California and’to live
there, would protect his job, would get Russo a
lawyer, and would guarantee that Garrison would
never extradite him back to Louisiana.

Gordon Noval, Worker'for the CIA,

Another important witness in the Shaw trial’ was
Gordon Novel, a” bugging and electronics expert who
worked for the CIA.- Garrison tried to subpoena him,
but he. left New Orleans and {led to Ohio. Garrison
was never able to extradite Novel from Ohio to Lovi-
siana in spite of: Novel’s public statements that he
knew who had killed David Ferrie. (Ferrie died mys-
teriously shortly after Garrison's probe became pub-j
lic knowledge. ) i id

Walter Sheridan told Perry Russo that NBC had
helped Novel ‘escape Garrison's clutches by flying
him out of Louisiana to McLean, Virginia (home of
the CIA). NOC paid for a lie detector test to be
administered :to Novel in McLéan.. The test was sup-
posed to prove that-Novel was telling the truth when
he. said he knew. nothing about the Kenacdy case.
Sheridan told Russo that NBC'would do the same thing
for him that they had done for Novel, namely, make
sure that Novel would never be extradited to Louisi-|
ana. to testify. Since Novel never was extradited “|
and since Governor Rhodes of Ohio blocked his extra-
dition making Governor icKeithen of Louisiana ex-
trenely angry, it would seem thet Sheridan-was Fight!
NBC did possess a lot of clout . i

Sheridan and Townley also went to work on Gordon
Novel's former wife, Marlene Mancuso. She was
another important Shaw trial. witness, .because..of he
knowledge about-Novel's CIA activities and a bur-
glory ‘of a munitions dump in Houma, Louisiana.
Townley called her end tried to convince her to
grant a taped interview for -usé on the NOC show..
He’ said Garrison was.going to. be destroyed and that.
she should cooperate with NBC.” --

‘The NBG Special on ‘June 19, 1967

|
a
The NSC-Walter: Sheridan “special on June 19, <n
1967, titled "The JFK Conspiracy — The Case of Jim: |
Garrison", was packed with Sheridanese.
the principal examples: :

1. A Lawyer naned Dean Andveiis in New Orleans’ had
played a key role in the Shaw trial because Clay:

Bertrand had telephoned him in a hospital. shortly
after the assassination and asked him to represent
Lee Harvey Oswald. Andrews told so many different
stories about Clay Bertrand that the truth was dif-"|
ficult to determine.

Frank McGee asked Andrews on the program about
Clay Bertrand and whether he was Clay Shaw. Andrews!
said Bertrand was actually Eugene C. Davis, a bar
owner ia New Orleans. Sheridan's coup quickly blew
up in his face when Davis denied the whole thing.
When the trial finally took place, Shaw was pegged
as Bertrand by a woman who saw him sign his name as
Clay Bertrand.

Bundy Lying

S$ second enint was to-attack the credi-
of Vernoa Buacy, a witness for the prosecution
seen Oswald and Shaw together on the New Or-
lakezront (Lake Pontehartrain).° Sheridan

MC up two “witnesses” agaiast Durdy. | NOC pre-

e. Baptist” Cancler, a burglar and

1 Torres,. also a burglar, who had. been ac~
quainted with Bundy.

Sheridan paid Cancler and Torres to make stato~
sents on-ihe program. ‘Cuneler-said that Bundy had.
micated to him that his story regarding Oswald
‘Shaw was not true. Torres.asserted that Bundy's
stimony was "an out-front lie". Cancler said he
si Been approached by members of Garrison's staff
to° “plant” sometiing. in’Shaw's house. Torres claimed
that che had been asked (by Garrison) to testify that
Shas had made. honosexual advances’ toward him and
also-that Shaw was Bertrand.

Frank ticGee reported that NBC had discovered
* Buridy was lying curing his polygraph test and Gar~
rison ‘knew it but let him testify anyway.

Cancler Sentenced to 18 Yoars

Following the T¥ show, Cancler was called before
the Orléans Parish grand jury ‘and asked to repeat
his-accusations under oath. Caneler took the. fifth
anenduent,. refusing to reiterate his TV charges. The
jury foreman imediately took Cencler before a judge
dnd-asked hia to repeat. Cancler again took: the
fifth and was found quilty of contempt of court and
fined $500 or one year. . Apparently Sheridan had
paid -him a lot more than $500. ‘Two weeks later
Cancler was handed a third convinction and sentenced
“to:eighteen yeors as a multiple offender.

Miguel Torres was also brought before a grand
Jury and took the fifth when he-was asked, “Were
the statements ou made on national: television on
NIC in June 1967,-concerning the district ettorney,
true?”

James Alcock, Garrison's assistant district at-
torney who handled the Shaw trial, saidto the judge,
“Torres and Cancier just tell the television and
Walter Sheridan about it.’ whér they have an oppor~
tunity todo something they take the fifth amendment.”

Sheridan Could Not Get Russo to “Cooperate”

3. Sheridan hiaself appeared on screen to discuss
Perry Russo. He could never get Russo -to change
his mind and cooperate, so Sheridan interpreted for
the. audience what Russo had told him. . He stated
that Russo told him that his testimony against Shaw
may-be a combination of truth, fantasy and lies.

Andrew Scianbra, Garrison's: assistant district
attorney who interviewed Russo, delivered a memo to
Garrison, detailing Walter Sheridan's efforts to

‘bribe and threaten Russo. The statements made by
Russo to Sciazbra were very incriminating about
Sheridan. Tie net result of all Sheridan's efforts
were that Russo stuck to his story at the trial.

Fred Leemans, “Witness”
4. Sheridan's lost “witness” on the show was Fred
Leemans, another bar owner (Sheridan seemed to
specialize in bar owners} and former Turkish bath
operator. Lecmans said that his original statements
given to Garrison about Clay Shaw were not true and
that his psyche began to trouble him. The morality

story. lic said, “After all,-I have to get something
out of all of this." (On hearing this line, one of*
Garrison's staff smiled and said, "Ah, -now.that"s
the Fred Leemans we all recognize.” ;

Bribing and Attempting to Briba Witnesses

In addition to bribing and attempting to bribe
witnesses, Sheridan also had meetings with one of
Garrison's part-time investigators, William Gur=
vich. Garrison found. out about the meetings-and
did not give Gurvich all of, the-information he.
wanted.

Jim Garrison said about Sheridan and the NOC
broadcast, “Aside from the fact that it insulted
the intelligence of every American, “it was a very
clear-attempt to prejudice in advance possible
jurors in the case.. This program will probably
‘Stand for years 25 a symbol of. the lengths to

‘which some powerful outside: interests will go in

order to interfere with state government."

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical...

Computers and Automation, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-
puters ahd data. processing, believes ‘that the pro-
fession of information engineer ‘includes not ‘only
competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but also a broad responsibility,
in a professional, and engineering sense, fo:

— The reliability and social significance
of pertinent input, data;

— The social value and truth of the :

output results.

In the: same-way, a- bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional: responsibility for the reliability and
significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes
from time to time articles and other information
related to socially. useful input and output of data
systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
— but productive of thought and an improved and
safer “house” for all humanity, an earth in which
our children and later generations may have a fu~
ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to
relate iis engineering to the most important and
most serious probleas in the world today: war,
miclear weapons, pollution, the population explo—
sion, and many more.

CIA HISTORIC



Se
8 February 1968

SUBJECT: . NQVEL, Gordon
(See also FURR, Lloyd B.)
(See also ARCACHA-SMITH, Sergio)

ALLEGATION: CIA CONNECTION:
Gordon NOVEL, former None

owner of a French Quarter Bar
in New Orleans, was subpoenaed
‘by. GARRISON as a material
witness in March 1967 but
NOVEL moved to Columbus, Ohio
and has avoided extradition.
GARRISON charged NOVEL

with burglary of the Houma 1c if
Monitions Bunker in 1961 CIA HISTORIC! :
together with David FERRIE RELEASE iN

and AROCHA-SMITH. . NOVEL
claimed this was a CIA
operation but later his
attorney. denied the story.

SOURCE:

Numerous news items, the
latest dtd in October 1967.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March
1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with
a burglary of a mmitions bunkde at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together
with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left
New Orleans, first going. to McLean, Virginia where he was given a
lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective. (See summary
on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial
claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's promimity to
McLean, Va.

After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967
a@ letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink
drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy
friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in
turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-ITEM, Hoke MAY.

ener

excluded from sutozatic
dgengrading and

dextasification,



Hoke MAY was granted a Covert Security Approval in April 1958

for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly
employed by FJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his
position with a private firm which handled work for the Project.

The letter was presumably written to a "Mr.. WEISS" in CIA and referred
to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVEL claimed

he was involved. This matter was reviewed by CI/R&A at the time the
matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE-CHEK

was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to
the widows of American flyers who participated.in the Bay of Pigs.

No connection-with NOVEL could be established. NOVEL knew Sergio
ARCACHA-SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario ._
Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti-Castro organization.
Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEL could have gained
an impression from him that he was employed by CIA.

In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from amest by GARRISON
on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned.to Louisiana to
testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe
on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana.

DETAILS:

The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker.
However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana
and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was
one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with
Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony
before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967,. that Colonel BURBANK
was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that
BURBANK and NOVEL knéw each other. BURBANK testified that every Louisiana
sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice oo ccleepeaiai

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel
#526113

1, On 20 May 1969, the Director of Security advised that
he had received a call from Mr. Bienvenu, Director. of. Security,--
National Security Agency, regarding a possible impersonation
by Subject. According to Mr, Biehve an ex-Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent, Mr. s ?
Avenue, Alliance, Ohio, 44601, ha alled Mr. Mathison and
a hat Subject had showna _
CIA credential and indicated tha ‘he was employed by the Agency.
Mr, Aufrance advised he called the National Security Agency to
bring this matter to the attention of the highest security officials
in Washington and that if anyone wished to cmtact him they should
call him before 5:00 p.m., this date.

2, After reviewing Subject's file and confirming that Mr,
Aufrance was an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, I briefed
the Director of Security who requested that I call Mr. Aufrance and
advise him that we were knowledgeable of Subject and that on other
occasions he had inferred he was employed by CIA. In addition, that
we intended to turn'this information over to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for investigation since the FBI had jurisdiction on such
impersonation cases,

3. Ilater briefed Mr.. Fred J. Cassidy, FBI/Liaison, who
suggested that Iadvise Mr. Aufrance to report the information to
local FBlagents. In Mr. Cassidy's presence, I called Mr. Aufrance
who repeated what he had told Mr. Mathison, He also stated that
Subject's wife is now separated from him and is suing him for divorce
in Columbus, Ohio, She has stated that Subject is armed, carries a



ao

OE SEGRET C

tear gas weapon and some kind of a . 22 caliber pistol, concealed as a
fountain pen, She stated that Subject is leaving Columbus for Reno,
Nevada, where he intends to open a gambling establishment, In further
discussion with Mr. Aufrance, he indicated his source was a friend of
Subject's wife and from. other statements he made, it is believed that his
source is Thomas F, Hughes, Jr., who was interviewed by the Chicago
Field Office on 18 April 1969,

4, After further discussion with Mr, Aufrance during which he
indicated he was-leaving for a fishing-trip in Canada and would not
return until Sunday, 25 May 1969, it was agreed that he would contact
the local Federal Bureau of Investigation and brief them regarding
Subject and that I would, meanwhile, alert FBI Headquarters/Washington,
which could follow-up with the local office.

5. Ithen provided Mr. Cassidy with all pertinent information
regarding Mr, Aufrance's telephone call and all information on Subject,

Mr. Cassidy will keep us advised,

Eubject was born 12 August 192] at Omaha, Nebraska. He fe a former
, Agency employee who EOD in October 19h9 as a GS-9 Intelligence Officer.
Subject resigned his steff status in February 1951 and became a staff
agent with Project/ EIDOMORPS in Turkey from March 1951 until July 1952.
(His wife Anne Claudia GUGAS nee SETARO was granted a covert security clearance
. in February 1952’ for use in @ clerical ara in the Middle East.)

In his assignment with Project [ i]in Turkey, Subject was "9
source of constant emberressment-in bie contacts with Turkish: (polica] F
officials. He was boastful, indiscreet, lacking in sound judgment, knew
little or nothing in the fields in which he was self-professedly en expert
end wee guilty of security breaches in failing to maintain his cover.

In one incident he made recommendations of police reorganizations to beg,
made by'province governors in Turkey} whereas, in Turkey, thes lice] S
Department 18.4 nationel organization and net subject to the dictates of
the province governors. This caused much 111 will end friction with the
Turkish’ ‘police. : i

machine and claimed he had two years' experience with the Los ‘Angeles:
Police Department prior to his employment with the Agency. However, it
was developed that instead of this claimed experience, he had actually
spent one or two weeks in a detective school cemnected with the Los Angeles
Police Department where he received delow average grades.

In October 1952 he approached an Agency employee regarding # nev.
type..of. technical equipment and this conversation led to the disclosure
by. Subject that he was employed by the Agency in a covert capacity; that
he was teaching lie detection techniques to foreign police depertmonts
without being authorized or competent to do so. Subject wes briefed in
December 1952. with strese placed on the importence of living up to his
security responsibilities and exercising utmost precaution in protecting
the covert interests of the Agency. /

In spite of the strong warnings given him in this interview, Subject
again becane involved in an incident of official embarrassment to the Agency.

In Mareh 1953 he misrepresented himself as a polygraph operator with the

- "State Department Secret Police”. This misrepresentation was made at a
time when the Department of Stéte was not suthorised to have a polygraph
machine end Congressional legislation was pending at the time regerding
such authorization. Ase result of this misrepresentation, Subject was
afforded. another security interview in March 1953. He explained thet
his cover company solé equipment to foreign coumtries through the Mutual
Aid Program and supplied consultant services to the State Department but
Subject denied that he ever represented himself as a State Department
polygraph operator. After the security interview Bubject wae also.essessed
by on Agency psychologist: (March 1953) and:was found to be egotisticsl,
emotionally, unstable, possessed of a need to build himself up in the
eyes of others ond gave either exaggerated or completely erroneous

. dnformeation as to his past positions. His intelligence quotient was found
to be comparatively low in relation to those of other Agency employees.
Tn April 1953 termination of his employment was recommended.

Subject renigned 29 April 1953 "te accept a position in California.
Washington clinate is not agreeable to his family.”

Ta April 1964 Mr. J. Kirk BAREVYOO?, Director of Security, McKesson
and Robbins, Skokie, Illinois, informed the Agency he hed been a witness
to unauthorized disclosures of classified information made by a group in
@ cocktail lc in Omaha, Nebraske. Tha individual making the disclosures
about. (ExDomoRPd, vities abroad under Agency sponsorship wae identified
as Leonard HARRELSON. Subject, who was then Director of Public Safety
for, the City of Omaha, Nebraska, was one of the group and it was believed
that he was responsible for supplying the classified information to HARRELSON
cout [ENDONORPH activities.

~

Leonard HARRELSON is a privete investigator specializing in _hypnoti oe
and the use of the polygraph machine. In.196h he wes employed by the
Polygraph Company in Chicago, Illinofse. In 1954 HARRELSON was in partnership
with Lloyd B. FURR in a private detective agency mown es the American
Bureau of Investigation, Tower Building, Washington, D. C. Lloyd B. FURR
ie the polygraph operator who gave a lie detector test to Gordon NOVEL,
hostile witness subpoenaed by GARRISON. The test received newspaper publicity
es being given at "McLean, Va." in March 1967. (Summary on FURR attached).

HARRELSON is believed to be @ person of poor morals. He was given
@ medical discharge from the Army as @ psychoneurotic in 1949 and-had been
court-martieled twice for impersonating non-commissioned officers of a
rank higher then he possessed. In his business partnership with FURR,
HARRELSON would misrepresent himself ao being with the FBI by covering the
word “American” when presenting hie credentials and dust showins “Bureau
of Investigation".

Incidentelly, the informait, J. Kirk BAREFOOT mentioned above, was

disapproved for Agency employment in 1951 because of falsification of his PHS,

MAY, Hoke Smith, # 167314

i. Note in the attached New Orleans States-Item articles that it

‘reportedly was to Hoke MAY, a reporter of that newspaper, that az im-

criminating letter which Gordon NOVEL allegedly wrote to a Mr. WEESS,
who was “presumably connected with CIA," was delivered.

2. According to the States-Item articles of 26 May 1967, the letter, L-vlica/
which appeared to be a draft, -had been found under a rug in an apartment:
occupied by NOVEL prior to his departure from New Orleans in about
mid-March 1957, and had been turned over to the boyfriend of one of two
girls who found it while cleaning the apartment. The boyfriend had turned
it over to his professor at a New Orleans university who is a friend of
Reporter Hoke MAY, and he delivered it te MAY. (NOVEL's attormey kas
stated that NOVEL worked for CIA in New Orleans in 1961). aaa

3. Hoke MAY, without question, is Subject who in April 1953 was ~~.
granted a Covert Security Approval for unwitting use by Project FIEIDULGE: ~~
MAY was not to be directly employed by FJINDULGE bot. was to be ased in
connection with his position with a private firm which handled work for the
Project.

4. Investigation of Subject by this Agency ia Bebruary/ March 1958
reflected nothing of a derogatory nature. It Hid indicate, however, tiat he
has in the past had an interest in politics and in 1952 was employed as
political campaign manager in the unsuccessful race of a candidate fer Congress
from Georgia. Subject's grandfather was a Governor of Georgia and later a
