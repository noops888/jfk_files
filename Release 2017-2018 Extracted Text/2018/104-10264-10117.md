seated that he had. oaintained himself in Cuba fron the proceeds of o small
bar he owns in Havana. :

LM." Subject stated that he, and other Segundo Frente officers, were not
trusted by Fidel Castro. Therefore, he has never been given any official
rerttton in Cuba. On several occasions Castro has offered hia Position as
Milftary Attache in @ Cuban Esbassy in a foreign country, but on each such
occasion he has refused the offer.

12. Subject stated that about 10 to 15 January 1961, it became possible

13, Although chetr departure was noticed by guards dices the coast, dy
militia members, and by patroi douts, subject stated that they vere not
impeded because they were heavily armed with machine sens, pistols, and
rifles, ond, apparently, because sone were ‘in uniforms vith instgnia of
high rank. The 19 members of the group (list attached) msde their way in
three fishing boats to Key West, Florida, where they arrived during the

night of 25-26 January,

14, This interrogation lasted from ten am to one pm at vhich time
Gutierrez Menoyo vas returned to a detention cell in the Immigration head-
quarters. Q. Maurice Hunsaker vas present during this interview. During
@ break for lunch, Mr, Edward Ahrens, District Director, [SNS, stated that
the members of the Meaoyo group would have to be removed from the I&NS
building in Miami because he feared an attecpt to remove Gutierrez Menoyo
from the building might be made, Arrangements were made with the Commanding
Offtcer, Homestead Airforce Base, to place the Cuban group under custody at
the Base until arrangements could be made for them to be flown to the I&NS
Detention Camp at McAllen, Texas.

15. Therefore, it was agreed between various CIA representatives in the
area that Hunsaker aided by Luis 2odriguez, ACSI representative, vould
continue interrogating Gutierrez Menoyo during the afternoea. The group would
then be taken to Homestead AF3 after dark, It was agreed rhac Hunsaker and
Rodriguez would question subject in 4 friendly and pleasant =anner in order
to acquire as mich information as possible from him so that discrepancies
in his story could be ascertained. It was the consensus of all concerned
that subject was telling complete untruths, but that he was extremely skilled
in doing so.

16. Consequently, Hunsaker and Rodriguez continued questioning subject

from two pm until five pm. During this. time, subject maintsized the general

continuity of the story he had expressed during the morning bours. Many
attempts were made to secure Order of Battle information, names of military
officials, sympathies of naned officials, plans of the Segundo Frente or of
the Government of Cuba. Subject pretended ignorance of all these subjects.
He maintained that because he vas not trusted by Caatro be had not been
allowed access to any military bases for the last two years. Because of
the numerous personnel changes he did not know the names of efficials in
important posts, etc. By this time it became evident thet firmer measures
o£ interrogation would be’ required, and it was planned that continuous
{aterrogation and a polygraph vould be employed on subject efter arrival at
Homestead Airforce Base. :

| 17, However, a sudden change of plans occurred and shortly after five pa
the encire Stroup of Cubans was whisked to the airport and put aboard a chartered
plane for New Orleans. At.New Orleans they were to be transferred to another
plane for passage to NcAllen Detention Camp. No further interrogation of
subject was possible. .

once gave any indication of nervousnese and was cool, calm, and collected at
every goment. He pursued his story carefully and correctly, never got mixed
tn his details, and although his explanations of many things, in particular
his Lack of occupation the Last two years, were completely unbelievable, he
did such an excellent job of discussing the situation that he sounded plausible.

It fs the opinton of Hunsaker that this man will not divulge information
Tt appears evident that he has a great

admiration for himself, he feels ke is a great man doing.a great job--regardless

of.what he considers that job to be at the moment~-and could not be shaken by

ordinary means of persuasion. Subject is an extremely handsome young man, and

it is obvious that he is proud of hie good looks. It is the opinion of some

of the men who have interrogated him that the weakest spot in his armor would

be a threat to mar his good looks: The threat of a good solid poke in the nose

might have considerable effect upon subject's willingness to talk.
