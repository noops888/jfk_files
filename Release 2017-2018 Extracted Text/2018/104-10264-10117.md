and to meet relatives of his country.

He stated that he made this trip at

his own expense and that he travelled alone. Immigration officials had

positive information that he made this trip in the company of Armando Pleitas

y Disz, another member of the Segundo Frente Group, but when he was challenged

on this point, subject flatly denied that Fleitas

13. Alchough cheir departure was noticed by gunrds airas the coast, by

milltle members, and by patroi souls,

subject stated that chiy bere not

with eschine guns, fistols, and

rifles, and, apparently, because some were in uniforns wiis insignia of

The 19 members of the group (list attached) made thetr way in

three fishing boats to key less, Florida, where they arrined during the

night of 25-26 January.

14. This Interrogation lasted from ten am to one pu at shich time

Cutlerrer Menoyo vas returned co a detention cell in the Innigration head-

quarters. Q. Maurice Hunsaker was present during this latersiew. During

a break for lunch, Mr. Edward Ahrens, District Director, IalS, stated that

the members of the Menoyo group would have to be removed from the IdNs

building In Miami because he feared an attempt to remove Queierrez Menoyo

from the building might be made. Arrangements were made with the Commanding

Officer, Homestead Airforce Base, to place the Cuban group under custody at

the Base until arrangements could be made for them to be fion co the IGNS

Detention Camp at McAllen, Texas.

15.

Therefore, It was agreed between varlous CIA representatives in the

area that Hunsaker aided by Luis Rodriguez, ACSI representative, would

continue interrogating Gutlerrez Menoyo during the afternoes.

The group would

then be taken to Homestead AFB after dark.

It was agreed chat lunsaker and

Rodriguez would question subject in a friendly and pleasant tanner in order

to acquire as much information as possible from him so that discrepancies

In his story could be ascertained.

the consensus of all concerned

chat subject was telling complete untruchs, but that he was extrencly skilled

in doing so.

16.

Consequently, Hunsaker and Rodriguez continued questioning subject

from two pm until five pm.

During this cim, subject maintaited the general

continuity of the story he had expressed during the morning bours. Many

attempts were made to secure Order of Battle information, napes of military

officials, sympathies of naved officials, plans of the Segundo Frente or of

the Government of Cuba.

Subject pretended ignorance of all chese subjects.

Ke maintained that because he was not trusted by Castro be bad not been

allowed access to any military bases for the last two years.

Because of

the numerous personnel changes he did not know the names of cificials in

important posts, etc. By this time it became evident that firmer measures

of interrogation would be required,

and it was planned that coatinuous

Interrogacion and a polygraph would be employed on subject after arrival at

Homestead Airforce Base.

17. However, a sudden change of plans occurred and shorely after five pe

the entire group of Cubans was whisked to the airport and put aboard a chartered

plane for New Orleans.

At New Orleans they were to be transferred to another

plane for passage to McAllen Detention Camp. No furcher lacerrogation of

subjece was possible.

18.

Eloy Gutierrer Menoyo is an Intelligent and capable man. He did not

give up a shred of useful Information in alx hours of interrogation.

lle never

once gave any indication of nervousness and was cool, calm, and collected at

every soment. He pursued his story carefully and correctly, never gọt mixed

In his details, and alchough his explanations of many things, in particular

his lack of occupacion the last tuo years, were completely unbellevable, he

did such an excellent lob of discussing the situation chat he sounded plausible. .

19. It 1s the opinion of lunsaker that this man will not divulge information

under normal interrogating techniques.

It appears evident that he hes a great

admiration for himself, ho feels he la a great man doing a great Job--regardless

of. what he considers that job to be at the moment--and could not be shaken by

ordinary means of persuasion. Subject is an extremely handsome young man, and

1c ta obvious that he is proud of his good looka.. It is the opinion of some

of the nen who have interrogated him that the weakest spot in his armor would

be a threat to mar his good looks:

The threat of a good solid poke in the nose

mighe have considerable ellect upon subject's willingness to calk.
