prostitutes and other unsavory individuals.

Company, Miami, made an extensive survey of theitelephone wiring

warning device system between ROSENTHAL's apartment,

The survey also reflected ROSENTHAL had a PBX
set up in his closet and a one-way mirror located in his
living room. Several holes were also observed in the
ceiling of the apartment, which led this expert to believe
that line had been dropped from apartment #318 for the
use of ROSENTHAL. Informant stated apartment #318 is
presently occupied by > 2. presumed used car,
salesman. . ¢

Another observation made by the telephone expert
was that due to the extra wiring which they found in the
frame room at the Beaux Gardens Apartments (which is
located across the. hall from ROSENTHAL's former apartment),
ROSENTHAL could have had access to any telephone line at
the Beaux Gardens Apartments.

Informant said that on Sunday, 6/21/64, a middle-aged,
rather husky Negro male was stopped in the 8000 building of the
Beaux Gardens Apartments after he had knocked on the door at
apartment #218, which is now vacant (formerly occuped by

to see CHARLEZ/WHITE (a former occupant of an apartment at the
Beaux Gardens Apartments). This individual was later identified

by the North Ba: Village- Police, according to the informant,
