Attn: €d Andrews}

SUBJECT : NOSENKO Related Material (U)

1. During the course of the House Select Committee
on Assassinations investigations, various files relating
to the Nosenko case were provided by your offices for
HSCA staff to review at Headquarters. These files arc
identified by subject in the attached listing. The files
are currently in my custody in Room 6D5317, OLC/HSCA.

2. Please review this listing and identify those
files which were provided by your office, or in cases
where the files came from the outside, those which shovld
properly be stored in your custody, and arrange to retrieve
the files. (U)

3. Much of this material may be soon requested by
FOIAers. All of. this material is covered by an agreement
between the DCI and Congress which requires that it be
retained, imtact, for a period of 30 years. So, do not
alter the files in any manner after you have retrieved
them until we have decided upon a course of action to
fulfill this archival commitment. That decision should be
reached prior to the end of March 1979 and will probably
involve the copying of the entire file for-archival purposes
after which the originals can. be returned to active use. (U)
