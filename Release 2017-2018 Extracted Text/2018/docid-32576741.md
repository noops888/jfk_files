contact him, after which the hoodlums would

take the

Agents under control.

Ithese hoodlums in the murder of Marfeo.

The hoodlums belleved that the marshals,

upon seeing Agent Rico, would relax, after

which they would kill Agent Rico, the marshals

and Kelley.

The hoodlums indicated that if

they locate SA Rico's exact address, they have

other plans in mind which were not furnished
