* 3-3 SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

This’ reports plar’ of four New England
hoodlums to*kill two Ayénts of our Boston
office. Three of these hoodlums are currently
fugitives in connection with the ITAR-Gambling
investigation. The fourth was arrested by our
Boston office yesterday and is being held on
$150,000 bond. All four have been implicated |
in the gangland Slaying of Rudy Marfeo, Boston,
Massachusetts, bookmaker. According to a '
former informant of our Boston office, the
Plans call for his urging our two Agents to
contact him, after which the hoodlums would
take the Agents under control. One Agent
would be killed immediately. SA Paul Rico
would_then_be_forced_to drive _the_hoodlums
to the plaee where John J. Kelley wag being
guarded-by-U. 8S. Marshals. Tey current-
ly cooperating with our~Bosti ni office_and hag ‘
provided detailed information implicating
these hoodlums in- the murder of Marfeo.

The hoodlums believed that the marshals, {
upon seeing Agent Rico, would relax, after :
which they would kill Agent Rico, the marshals)
and Kelley. The hoodlums indicated that if H
they locate SA Rico's exact address, they have)
other plans in mind which were not furnished
our source. :

‘The Lerner mentioned in this teletype i
when apprehended by our Boston office yester-'
day, commented to Agent Rico "You look just |
like your pictures." Lerner, according to 4
Kelley, igs extremely courageous and appears to,
relish killing. : 1

’ A teletype is being sent immediately to
SAC, Boston, containing specific instructions |
to afford SA Rico and his family adequate
security; to vigorously press their investi- -
gation toward locating the three fugitives
involved in this Plan; to insure U. 8. Marshal;
aware of plan and that adequate security
afforded Kelley; and in the event Lerner makes)
