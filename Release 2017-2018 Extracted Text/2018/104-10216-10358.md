‘THE 1S UNEVALUATED INFORMATION, SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE,

SOURCE A former high-level Cuban official who was once active in the revolutionary
movement and a confidant of Fidel Castro. He has always been anti-Commnist and
4s now strongly anti-Castro. He continues to maintain contact with many Cuban
officials at all levels of government. Source has provided.a limited mumber of .
reports which appear to have been accurate. :

Headquarters Comment. Source, who also has good contacts anong leaders of the
Federacion Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU, University Student Federation), re-
ported on 2 February 1965 that Jaime Crombet and Lazaro Mora would be elected
president and vice-president, respectively, at the 8 - 10 February elections
of FW officers at the University of Havana. The following coments by Source
are reported in light of his experience and insight in Cuban student matters,

work which the Cuban régime tries to impose. Lazaro Mora,.the new vice-president, many)
glthough younger than Crombet, is a member of the student “old guard;" he worked
with Rolando Cybele Secades during the period when the latter was president of
the FEU, from late 1959 fo 1961. Mora still maintains close contact with Cubela,
who apparently plans to retain his influence at the University with the students
through Mora and with the faculty through Luis Soto, Vice-Rector of the Univer-
sity. It is certain that Fidel Castro will not be able to control the students
through Crombet as he has done through his predecessor, Jose Rebello Alonso,

for the past two years. The fact that the students no longer react spontaneously
will make Crombet's task a difficult one. Crombet may be able to attract members
of the Union de Jovenes Comunistas (UJC, Union of Communist Youths), of which he
has been president, but Mora is considered the leader of the anti-Commnist groups
at the University. A small Trotskyist group still exists, but it is insignificant.

Headouarters Comment. A Havana radio broadcast of 11 February 1965 announced
‘the results of the elections, naming, among others, Crombet, Mora, [liana Valmana
as secretary of organization, and Francisco Dorticos as deputy secretary of
organization.
