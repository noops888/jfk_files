On 4/29/59 THEODORE A. JONES visited the Chicago

Office andireiterated his anti-Communist policies with regard

to the governing of the Chicago Branch NAACP and was

confident that the Communists had been defeated. During

this interview JONES gave no indication of having knowledge

of the Co-ordinating Committee of the NAACP. He was quite

confident of his ability to keep Communists

out of the Chicago

Branch NAACP and indicated that while he would not run for re-

election in 12/59 he has selected a well known Negro business

executive and anti-Communist to succeed him and is confident

of this individual's election. He indicated, however,

a group of individuals whom he named were causing trouble

in the branci

I and that he suspected them as being Communists.

Caucus to Name Proposed Left Wing

Slate of Delegates to NAACP National Convention

INSOLMANT

[CG 6066-S advised that on 5/7/59 the Co-ordinating

Committee of the NAACP held a meeting at which a slate of

delegates to the NAACP National Convention was nominated.

This meeting was attended by between 40 - 50 individuals,

including such prominent Communists as MILTON COHEN, member,

State Committee, CP, LESTER DAVIS, State Committee, CP, ROBERT

HYMER, member of CP

NAACP fraction, FRITZI ENGLESTEIN, a

prominent leader in the Ninth. Congressional District, CP,

LEO and BETTY GOLDMAN, and others.

There were also in attendance

current members of the swe and members of the ISi until it

merged with the socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.

Informant advised that the individual leader of

this caucus was one TIM BLACK,

a Chicago school teacher and

an individual who can be described as a Negro nationalist.

However, informant advised that the leadership of ENGLESTEIN

and COHEN was instrumental in maneuvering in picking the

slate.

The slate itself includes two SWP members, one former

ISL members

two CP members and one leader of the Socialist

Party - Social Democratic Federation, out of a total proposed

Chicago Branch delegation of nine members.

INFoRmANT The Co-Ordinating Committee strategy, according to

CG 6066-S, is that at the meeting at which the

Chicago Chapter

delegation is selected, they will pack the meeting with 75 to

80 of their group which is considered enough to swing the

vote in favor of their delegates.

The Co-ordinating Committee

is to concentrate on working for

the nine named delegates

as

delegates rather than alternates as it assumes the regular

NAACP organization will have its votes split further in

selecting both delegates and alternates.

Experience has shown that only 100 people attend

a NAACP meeting of this type. Therefore, the Co-ordinating

Committee feels that by having approximately 75 of its people

at the meeting it will sweep the election of delegates to

the National Convention and this

in turn will open the door

for a sweep of the 12/59 elections for the leadership of the

Chicago Branch.

Observations and Proposals

Reliable informants have reported that the strength

of the CP in the leadership of the NAACP, Chicago Branch,

today is at its lowest ebb.

Within the past several weeks

the of fraction for work within the NAACP has been working

to organize and to broaden its

NAACP by defeating JONES as well as to increase its strength

in or at least change the leadership of the National Ifice

of the NAACP. If the Co-ordinating Committee objective of

election of its slate of delegates from the Chicago Branch

to the National Convention is successful, It will result in

a major accomplishment of CP organizational efforts in the

Negro field in that the NAACP in Chicago alone has approxi-

mately

• 20,000 members.

With these facts in mind and in considering that

THEODORE A. JONES is an intelligent and able leader with a

political machine of Congressman WILLIAM DAWSON to back him

up, it is felt that if he were put to notice of the existence

this caucus and slate he could defeat the CP in its

to attempt to get control of. the Chicago Branch and

picture of the NAACP.

As indicated previously as late as

4/29/59 when JONES visited this office he was unaware of

any organized resistance to his leadership although he

recognized individual dissatisfaction among the members as

a result of their statements at Branch meetings.

It is felt that a counterintelligence gain that

will hurt the CP can be had with complete security insofar

as the Bureau is concerned and the following is suggested:

That Chicago be permitted to prepare a letter for

anonymous mailing to THIODORE A. JONES, President of the

Chicago Branch, NAACP, at the earliest possible date to make

him aware of the existence of this organized faction as

well as to the existence of the slate of candidates backed

by the group of individuals in opposition to the present

policies and leadership of the national and Chicago Branch,

NAACP.

CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE

Chicago Office by airtel 5-14-59 advised that through several

reliable informants,

it was learned that a loosely knit group of individuals,

whose sole objective is to oust the Jones leadership calling themselves the

Coordinating Committee of the NAAC, has been formed. Included in this

group are members of the Communist Party (CP), USA, members of the socialist

Workers Party (SWP) (trotskyite organization); socialists; and other Negro

nationalist type individuals.

for the past several months this group has

held surreptitious meetings throughout Chicago organizing opposition to

Jones and also against the present national leadership of the NAACP.

INFORMANT

According to [cG 6066-5, a meeting of this Coordinating Committee:

of the NAACP was held 5-7-59 at which a slate of nine delegates was

selected to attend the NAACP national convention scheduled to be held in

New York in July, 1959. This meeting was attended by 40 to 50 individuals

including prominent Chicago communists, Milton Cohen and Lester Davis,

members Illinois State Committee CP, Robert Hymer, member of CP NAACP

praction and others. The nine-member a late of convention delegates includes

two CP members and members of trotskyite and socialist groupings.

The

strategy of this co-ordinating Committee is to pack the meeting of the

Chicago branch of the NAACP scheduled for May 22, 1959, with 75 or 80 members

of their group and push for the election of their slate of nine delegates

previously selected.

since only approximately 100 people attend a Chicago

branch ire sty of this type, the coordinating Committee feels it will sweep

the election of their delegates to the national convention and thereby also

lay the groundwork for ousting the Jones leadership of the Chicago branch

of the NAACP at the nect election in December,

1959.

If this concerted

plan of the Ce and other dissident elements is successful, it would be a

dangerous accomplisiment since the strength of the CP

the Chicago branch

of the NAACP at the present time is at its lowest ebb.

It is, therefore,

extremely desirable that we discreetly frustrate the

Co-ordinating Committee inside the NAACP.

Suggestions and Recommendations

Chicago feels that it played a definite part in the

defeat of the

"left caucus"

"right led" mass organization.

an attempt by the CP to infiltrate

Based on the results of the above and because of the

broad CP program of infiltration of mass organizations, it is

felt that this incident has demonstrated that the Bureau's

Counterintelligence Program can successfully be extended to

cover CP programs in "right led"

organizations.

The Bureau may desire to advise the field of the

additional counterintelligence possibilities offered in the

matter of the counteracting of Communist influence in mass

organizations.

It is felt that with careful planning and implementation,

the Bureau's Counterintelligence Program can be further extended

to obtain additional

effective results.

As outlined in referenced letter,

In its May, 1959 effort. After its set back in May,

1959, the

""'left caucus"

appraised the

position. astutely

and began quietly to build an organization.

During the summer of 1959 while regular NAACP

activity at Chicago vas curtailed, the "left caucus"

set up a regular schedule of meetings, increased its

membership, elected a leadership and acquired funds.

The "left caucus" also recruited vigorously new NAACP

members at Chicago who were ideologically allied with the'

"left caucus"

After organizing carefully from June to

October, 1959 and baiting JONES continually during that

period,

the "left caucus" in October, 1959, dealt the

current Chicago NAACP leadership, headed by THEODORE JONES,

two jarring blows:

The entire "Ieft caucus" slate

of delegates was elected to represent the Chicago NAACP

Branch at the 10/59 Illinois State Convention.

JONES,

though the leader of Illinois' most influential NAACP

Branch, was not even elected a delegate to the organization's

state convention; 2) The "left caucus" slate was elected

in toto in the annual NAACP nominating committee election.

This nominating committee is the key to NAACP elections

because it selects those names which will aypear on the

ballot at the annual December Chicago Branch NAACP election.

Among those elected to the nominating committee

of eight were MILTON COHEN and LESTER DAVIS, members of the

Illinois State CP Committee, FRITZE ENGLESTEIN, Illinois

It has been learned

that the "left caucus"

dominated nominating committee, while supposedly going

to nominate a slate acceptable

to both JONES and the

"left caucus", a "harmony slate", will at the last

possible instant on November 27, 1959, the day the ballot

is drawn up, nominate "left caucus" leader GERALD BULLOCK,

Whom JONES reportedly despises. BULLOCK will reportedly

be supported by former Chicago NAACP President WILLOUGHBY

ABNER, an enemy of JONES, Whom JONES defeated in the

Chicago NAACP Branch Presidential election of 1957. The

"left caucus" feels that the BULLOCK-ABNER coalition

will win easily not only because of its strength perse,

but primarily due to the fact that its existence will not

become known to JONES until the last minute on November 27,

1959 when itris too late for JONES to rally his forces.

It should be noted that in October, 1959,

Illinois CP Chairman CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT said that the

"inmediate task"of the Illinois CP is to recruit members

for the Chicago NAACP before November 11, 1959. LIGHTFOOT

said that new NAACP recruits who are signed up before

November 11, 1959, will be eligible to vote in the

December 11,

1959

Chicago NAACP election and that thus

the CP can play a prominent behind-the-scenes role in the

December, 1959 Chicago NAACP election.

• On November 7, 1959, LESTER DAVIS, in addressing

South Side Chiçago CP leaders, said that "the NAACP

at Chicago can be altered by changing the rotten leadership....

We are within grasp of victory.....He are well nigh in a

position to exercise control of NAACP at Chicago."

Observations and Proposals

Based on the preceding information, it would

appear that the "left caucus" of NAAC? seems in an

excellent position to take over the NAACP at Chicago.

Unless President THEODORE JONES can somehow be energized

to marshal his Iollowers ad campaign aggressively, it

appears that the CP, by using the "left caucus" and directing

CP members in the "left caucus"

, will achieve a

significant degree of control of NAACP at Chicago.

CONFDSEINTIAL

In an attempt to frustrate the "left caucus"

the following tactic is suggested.

IN'JORMANT

NAACP President THEODORE JONES andICE I4uS, been

the Chairman and key man on the NAACP Nominating Committeel

are both vitally interested in the civil rights question

and are both anti-Communist. IG 14-5, who holds a

INFORMANT

leadership position in the

"left caucus", has asked for

guidance in what he calls "his current dilemma"

AS a MiSURMANT

"left caucus" leader, CG 14-S wants to progress in the

caucus and thus increase his value to the Bureau. As a

well-educated, intelligent Negro, he knows Communism

to be detrimental to the best interest of the Negro people

and fears

that the "left caucus" taking over NAACP at

Chicago will be prejudicial to the best interest of the

Negro.

INTORMANS

Currently CG 14-Slis meeting regularly with

NAACP President THEODORE JONES in an effort to work out

the so-called "harmony slate". It will be recalled that

the "leit caucus" is reportedly only using the "harmony

slate" as a subterfuge and plans at the last minute on

November 27, 1959, to double CrOSS JONES and to spring

the BULLOCK-ABNER coalition.

INFORMANT

In response to[CG 14-s] request for guidance,

the Chicago Division proposes that while giving him

guidance, it simultaneously can initiate a counterintelligence

action.

DELETED. IDENTIEY

AS TENDS TO

The Chicago Division proposes that ICG 14-S,

in his discussions with JONEs early in the week of November

2,1959, discretely and indirectizlinform JONES of the

BULLOCK-ABNER coalition's existence and the fact that

the coalition, will be sprung on JONES on November 27,

1930 when it is too late for him to marshal opposition forces.

The Chicago Division feels that if JONES is

informed in time that his hated enemy GERALD EULLOCK 1S,

by mears of a coup, attempting to succeed him, vill

become enraged, summon his lieutenants and go all out

to defeat BULLOCK and the "left caucus" with him.

Even if Jones' is energized and goes all out,

he will' reportedly have great difficulty in defeating

the "left-caucus". If he were to activate and could not

defeat the "left caucus" completely, it is felt that

his political activities, if he can be influenced to

organize, can at least gain him sufficient support to

limit the Party influence in the NAACP to nirreducible

minimum.

It is noted that after due consideration, the

Chicago Division feels that an anonymous mailing would

not again be effective in this situation..

Informant advised that JONES' reaction upon

receiving this information was one of surprise and anger.

He promptly stated that although he did not intend to be a

candidate for re-election as President of the Chicago

Branch and had planned to take a cooperative and amenable

attitude toward the "harmony slate" being prepared by the

Nominating Committee, he now saw the need for direct

action in support of candidates of his own choosing in

the Branch election. He said he was considering two or three

individuals who might be strong candidates for President,

and that one of these would receive the unqualified and

active support of himself and his followers.

The following intormation concerning the recent

developments in this matter was received from CG 14-S

on 12/2/59:

INCORMANT

" Within a few days, after a meeting by JONES with

his supporters, he flatly rejected the "harmony slate"

which was offered by the Nominating Committee. Further,

at a meeting of the "left caucus" a decision was made that

the caucus would support a full slate of candidates which

included GERALD BULLOCK for President, LOLA BELLE HOLMES

for Secretary, and LESTER DAVIS and SAUL MENDELSON as

Executive Board members. DAVIS is a current member of the

Illinois State Committee of the Communist Party (CP) and

HOLMES is an Illinois CP member. MENDELSON is a former

member of the National Committee of the Independent

Socialist League, now defunct.

The JONES forces also prepared a slate which

included DEIPSEY TRAVIS, a well-known Negro realtor for

President, WILLIE THOMAS for First Vice President, ETHEL

DOSTAL for Secretary, and JAMES KEMP for Treasurer. TRAVIS

is a candidate personally selected by JONES, and the others

named are incumbents who are strong supporters of JONES.

KEMP IS One Of JONES' first lieutenants and the source of

much of his

following among trade union members. JONES,

himself, is a candidate for the Executive Board on this

slate.

At a meeting of the Chicago Branch on 11/27/59,

the most important business was the election of a three

man Election Supervisory Committee to serve at the Branch

election on 12/11/59. The duties of this Committee are

to control procedures connected with the distribution of

the ballots and, in the past,

the Committee has also super-

vised the counting of the ballots.

This meeting was called

by JONES in a union hall near 74th Street and Cottage Grove

and his opponents accused him of choosing this hall because

he would be able to marshal additional support from Chicago

NAACP members who are trade unionists and who normally

isoman congregate there for recreational purposes.

According to

ICG 14-S,] there were over 200 members present at this meeting

and the composition of the membership present at first

indicated that the supporters of the "left caucus" enjoyed

a slight numerical advantage.

With JONES presiding, the

meeting was temporarily delayed until additional members

from JONES' camp arrived.

Both sides offered three candidates for the

Election Supervisory Committee and each side named three

tellers to count the votes. It had been indicated that

there were about 220 members present but after 220 ballots

were counted there were still a large number of uncounted

allots remaining. This brought a sharp protest Irom saul

LENDELSON, a leading member of the "left caucus" who wa:

serving as a teller for the caucus.

One of the JONES tellers

insisted that he had counted at least 300 members present

and the counting of the ballots was continued after a

ruling by JONES.

When the vote count passed 265 and there were

still a substantial number of uncounted ballots, MENDELSON

became extremely angry and challenged the legality of the

election. JONES ruled against him.

MENDELSON then seized

both the counted and uncounted ballots. and threw them out

into the crowd, scattering the ballots on the floor.

After the confusion subsided, JONES, as Chairman,

ruled that MENDELSON had forfeited the election by his

action. He then announced that JAMES KEMP, THEODORE

These developments left the meeting in an uproar

and GERALD BULLOCK took the floor and drafted a telegram

of protest to ROY WILKINS, National NAACP leader, waich was

signed by BULLOCK and at least ten others. The telegram

demanded supervision of the Chicago Branch election in

December

by impartial representatives of the NAACP National

Office.

In a meeting of tha"left caucus" held on 12/1/59,

the major activity was

the composition of a long letter

to the national leadership of the NAACP which included a

statement that a copy of the letter was being sent to the

local press. It was expected that this letter might influence

YILKINS to take action as requested by the "left caucus" in

supervising the forthcoming Branch election.

Some considera

tion was also given to a proposal that an attempt be made

to obtain an injunction of some type against the JONES

forces.

No final decision was made on this proposal at

that time.

Observations and Conclusions

Although pertinent developments in this matter

have been set forth above, it is not possible to predict

the outcome of the 12/11/59 election at this time.

However,

CG 14-S has pointed out that if the Election Supervisory

Committee composed of JONES supporters is permitted to

function at the Branch election,

the "'left caucus" will be

faced with a very limited possibility of success. As

an

indication that the Illinois Party leadership is concerned

about this development, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT recently instructed

both DAVIS and HOLMES to seriously consider remaining in

Chicago for the election in spite of the fact that they

are scheduled to accompany the Illinois delegation to the

CP National Convention on the same weekend.

From the developments to date, it is apparent

that JONÉS did take immediate and aggressive action in

mobilizing his forces for the 11/27/59 Branch meeting.

addition, he rejected the "harmony slate" supported by

the "left caucus" and presented a slate of his own candidates

for Branch officers.

These were the immediate objectives

of the Chicago office in initiating this counterintelligence

activity as set forth in re airtel of 11/19/59.

The Bureau will be promptly advised of any

additional pertinent developments, including the final

outcome of the 12/11/59 Chicago Branch NAACP elections.

at seizing control of the Chicago Branch at the annual election on

December 11, 1959.

The planned strategy of the "left caucus"

was to have

its slate of officers nominated at the pre-election meeting scheduled

November 27, 1959. Lour informant, CG 14-S, was the chairman of the

Nominating Committeel which committee consisted of three communists, two

of whom were on the Illinois State Communist Party (CP) committee, as weld

as a member of the Socialist Workers Party and a former member of the

national committee of the Independent Socialist League. According to SC

CG 14-S, it looked as though the Nominating Committee would nominate a

nist as secretary and another communist as executive board member. The

Jones forces prepared an opposing slate of noncommunist officer candidates.

At the Chicago Branch meeting on November 27, 1959, the most important busi

the Branch election on December 11, 1959.

This committee would control pro-

cedures connected with the distribution of ballots and supervise the count-

ing of the baliots.

The November 27, 1959, meeting was called by Jones in

a union hall near

74th Street and Cottage Grove in Chicago and his oppo-

nents accused him of choosing this hail because he would be able to marshal

additional support from Chicago NAACP members who are trade unionists and

who normally congregate there for recreational purposes.

Jones, who was presiding, delayed the meeting until additional Jones sup

porters arrived. Both sides then offered three candidates for the Election

When the vote count passed 265 and there

was still a substantial number

of uncounted ballots, Saul Mendelson, a lead-

ing member of the "left caucus" who was serving as a teller for the caucus,

became extremely angry and challenged the legality of the election. Jones

ruled against him and Mendelson then seized both the counted and uncounted

ballots and threw them out into the crowd, scattering the ballots on the

I100r.

After the confusion subsided, Jones, as chairman, ruled that

Mendelson had forfeited the election by his

action and then announced that

the candidates representing the Jones forces had been elected to the Electic

Supervisory Committee.

Jones then adjourned the meeting and left the hall.

These developments left the meeting in an uproar and Gerald Bullock, who 1s

CONFPIENTIAL

CG 200-32864

to JONES of the "left Caucus" plan to double cross

him, JONES emerged from his lethargy and went into

action.

JONES used the technique "first things first"

and from 11/24/59, to 11/27/59, he concentrated on

defeating the "Left Caucus" attempt to gain control of

the Election Supervisory Committee. JONES' first goal

was achieved during the turbulent

meeting of 11/27/59,

(Chicago airtel of 12/3/59).

From 11/28/59, to 12/11/59, JONES, with apparently

only his most intimate lieutenants as confidants, planned

the following strategy which was put into practice on

12/11/59, and resulted in the routing of the "Left Caucus"?

JONES reportedly in early December, 1959,

although a strong Republican, entered into an alliance

with the strong Chicago South Side Democratic Organization

for the purpose of defeating the "Left Caucus". As the

election process began at approximately 8:30 p.m. on

12/11/59,

the South Side Democratic Organization held

tight control of the balloting process.

Democratic

ward committeemen, piecinct captains and their followers

were located strategically at each phase of the election

process.

The Democratic Organization 'got out' the vote

and despite the fact that a torrential rain storm occurred

on the evening of 12/11/59, the Democratic Organization

"brought® in" enough people to insure JONES' victory

by a. wide margin.

JONES also struck a paralyzing psychological

blow at the "Left Caucus". Any "Left Caucus" thought

of disrupting the meeting was removed quickly because

on approaching the polling place the first sight visible

through the intense rain was the flashing red lights

of police vehicles. Inside eight uniformed policemen

directed by a police sergeant circulated continuallyand

by their presence thwarted any latent disruptionist

tendencies of the "Left Caucus". The election was run

in an efficient businesslike manner and was directed

by an NAACP Official appointed by the NAACP leadership.

At the completion of the balloting, the "Left Caucus"

made no complaint of any kind regarding irregularities.

Observations and Conclusions

Without the use of the counterintelligence tactic

sanction?in Bureau teletype of 11/23/59, it is felt

that the "Left Caucus" would possibly have taken over

NAACP at Chicago or certainly gained a poweriul voice

in Chicago NAACP affairs by successfully gaining a

INsormaNt number of elective positions.

As late as 11:00 a.m.

on 12/11/59.[CG 14-STadvised the Chicago Division

that

he, from his close vantage point, deemed the election's

results "a toss up". It is also

felt by the Chicago

Division that the use of any lesser counterintelligence-INFORMANT

technique would have failed badly. CG 14-S has advised

that undoubtedly the "leak" of the impending "Left Caucus"

double cross so jolted JONES that JONES dropped everything

and set out to defeat the

"Left Caucus".

The result

of using the counterintelligence tactic in point seens to

be that for the year 1960, NAACP at Chicago will have

outspoken anti-Communist leadership to the consternation

oj Illinois CP Chairman CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT who designated

NAACP at Chicago as the point of CP concentration for

mass organizational work.

It is noted that LIGHTFOOT

had assigned

several Illinois C? members, including two

Illinois CP District Committeemen to the

allout task

of taking over NAACP at Chicago by means of a "Left

Caucus" victory in the 12/11/59, NAACP Election at Chicago.

As far as the informant knows, HALL is not

personally acquainted with LUTHER KING, and was not fully aware of

KING's pro-Communist leanings until recently, when LEVISON,

through LEM HARRIS, Sent HALL a report on KING, and LEVISON'S

close association with KING.

Although not impossible, it is in-

consistent that HALL in New York would write a speech

for KING,

nom, untid recently,

HALL, although he can deliver a fair speech, does not

write well.

He is ungrammatical and knows little if anything

about proper sentence structure. NY I-ll has heard in the

past that HALL, in preparing to give a speech has submitted the

Lideas to people such as JAMES ALIEN, MICHAEL DAVIDOW and ARNOLD

JOHNSON, who actually write the speech. It: is therefore, in the

informant's opinion, highly improbable

that HALL wrote the

speech in question.

What adds to the improbability is the

What HALI may have said to another source with regard

to his being the author of the said speech must be interpreted

in the light of HALL's character and motives.

Hall is a pompous,

conceited, arrogant individual and may have taken credit for the

speech to

enhance his own prestige.

or, Inasmuch as he may

have wished to protect LEVISON, a secret Party member, he may

have assumed personal responsibility for KING's speech. The

chisa possibility in this regard is that HAll, in mentioning

HIGHLANDER FOLK SCHOOL

An Atlanta Journal newspaper article appeared December 15,

1957, entitled "Highlander Director Says School Not Communist, But

In Same Field". The article reported the Highlander Folk School was

established in September, 1932, by MYLES HORTON, Director, and

DONALD L. lEST, a Georgian with a long record of affiliations with

Communist front groups. HORTON denied that he or the school had

ever had any connection with the Communists.

The article stated that Highlander hit the headlines two

months ago when the Georgia Commission on Education published a

four-page newspaper-size report charging that the institution is a

"Communist Training School.

The commission, set up by the Georgia

Legislature to help preserve segregation, charged that Highlander's

race-mixing plans are part of a communist scheme to create strife.

As proof, the commission reported that a number of persons who had

been connected with Highlander also had been connected with

organizations labeled as communist fronts by the HUA.

NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO ABOLISH

THE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE

On May 3; 1951, a confidential source advised that the

National Committee to Abolish the Un-American Activities Committee

was organized in August, 1950, at Los Angeles, California, to

stimulate new and utilize all efforts of interested individuals and

organizations in a national campaign to promote public education

leading to political action to abolish the House Committee on Un-

American Activities (HCUA). The National Committee to Abolish

the Un-American Activities Committee will not duplicate the work

of other Civil Liberties organizations, which include the abolition

of the HUA as a part of their program, but will encourage the

coordination and consolidation of all their efforts for abolition,

and will promote new efforts in those Congressional Districts where

education and political action for abolition have not been initiated.

FRANK WILKINSON is the Field Representative of the

National Committee to Abolish the Un-American Activities Committee.

According to the source, WILKINSON periodically confers with

DOROTHY HEALEY, Chairman, Southern California District Communist

Party, and is in close touch with other leading communist

functionaries in the Los Angeles area.

Another source on September 17, 1952, advised that FRANK

WILKINSON was a Communist Party member as of September, 1952.

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC.

The Southern Patriot, a monthly publication, shows that

1t 1s published by the Southern Conference Educational Fund, Inc.

(SCEF) •

The Southern Patriot was cited as an "organ" of the

Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW) by the Committee on

Un-American Activities, House Report 592, on the SCHW, June 12, 1947.

The SCHW was cited as a communist front by the Committee

on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 16, 1947.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW changed the name

of that organization to the SCEF, and listed its purpose as being

to improve the educational and cultural standards of the Southern

people in accordance with the highest American democratic institu-

tions, traditions, and ideals. The amendment was dated April 26,

1946.

A source,

who is familiar with some phases of Communist

Party (CP) activity in the New Orleans area, advised on May 22, 1959,

that during the time the SCHil was in existence, CP members were

members of and worked actively in the ScHW.

However, since the

formation of the SCEF, rank and file CP members have

not been

encouraged to work in the SCEF.

The source stated that the SCEF is

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a CP front

organization because it has gone along with the CP on certain

work in

issues, particularly on the racial question, and through the years,

certain CP members in the New Orleans area have been assigned to

work in the organization to further CP principles.

On May 22, 1959, the source advised that in the past he

has considered JAMES DOMBROWSKI, the Executive Director of the SCEF,

to be a Communist, if not an actual Communist Party member, because

he followed communist principles.

The source also advised on May 22, 1959, that many people

who are officials and members of the SCEF, while liberal in their

views, are by no means communists.

WOMEN'S PEACE AND UNITY CLUB, formerly

known as the Chicago Women for Peace

The aims and purposes of the Chicago Women for Peace (CWP),

as set forth in its self-identified publication, "Chicago Acts

for

peace" (CAP), May, 1951, issue, describes this organization as a

"service center for women working for peace." This publication

described the Chicago Women for Peace as being affiliated with

the American Women for Peace and as co-operating with the American

Peace Crusade.

The January, 1954, issue of "CAP" announced the dissolution

of the American Women for Peace and the affiliation of the Chicago

Women for Peace with the American Peace Crusade Council in Chicago.

A source advised in November, 1956, that the CWP remained

affillated with the American Peace Crusade, Chicago, until that

organization dissolved in September, 1955.

The CWP continued with

no national affiliation until September, 1956, when a "re-organization

and name change took place

Peace and Unity Club"

(whin' and it became known as the "Women's

The reason given for this "re-

organization and name change" by DOROTHY HAYES, Secretary of the

organization, was that the CWP had been formed

to end the Korean War

and since that war was over and there was a "measure of peace in the

world"

, women's interests were more centered on such issues as civil

rights,

desegregated and better schools, juvenile delinguency, equal

opportunities for women, housing, and cost of living, source

advised that the only actual "re-organization" of the CP was the

change of its name to "Women's Peace and Unity Club".

Another source advised in October, 1956, that the CP,

Illinois-Indiana District, had ordered the dissolution of the CWP

because it no longer served the purpose of the Party, since it was

a "Left-wing"

peace group. Though the CP refused to dissolve and

chose to continue in the form of the "Women's peace and Unity Club,"

it continues to be a "Communist front organization" whose policies

and activities are directed by DOROTHY HAYES, a known CP member.

The previous source advised on May 7, 1959, that the

WPUC continues

to operate in the Chicago area as a peace organization

under the same leadership and with the same objectives.

The American Women for Peace and the American Peace

crusade have all been designated by the Attorney General of the

United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

group, under the leadership o1 national committee member

Sam Ballan, Inown in the SWP as Sam Marcy, split from the

SWP.

The source stated that this minority. group referred

to as the Marcyites, alter many years of program and policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and inter-

pretation of political events, split from the SWP on the

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by departing

from the Marxist precepts of Leon Trotsky and retreating

from the fight for the world socialist revolution. The

final issue which ultimately forced the split was the minority's

opposition to the SWP regroupment policy which involved

cooperation with the Communist Party (CP) periphery -

individuals characterized by the minority as petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,

advocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union

and nas as lis goal the building of a revolutionary party

with a complete proletarian orientation for the purpose

of overthrowing capitalism in the United States and throughout
