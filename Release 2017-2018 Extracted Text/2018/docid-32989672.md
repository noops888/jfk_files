Caucus to Name Proposed Left Wing
Slate of Delegates to NAACP National Convention

IN G0 AT

{cc 6066-8] advised thatm 5/7/59 the Co-ordinating

Committee of the NAACP held a meeting at which a slate of
delegates to the NAACP National Convention was nominated.
This meeting was attended by between 0 - 50 individuals,
including such prominent Communists as MILTON COHEN, member,
State Committee, CP, LESTER DAVIS, State Committee, CP, ROBERT
| HYMER, member of CP NAACP fraction, FRITZI ENGLESTEIN, a
prominent leader in the Ninth Congressional District, CP,
H LEO and BETTY GOLDMAN, and others. There were also in attendance
i current members of the SWP and members of the ISL until it

merged with the Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.

Informant advised that the individual leader of
this caucus was one TIM BLACK, a Chicago school teacher and
an individual who can be described as a Negro nationalist.
However, informant advised that the leadership of ENGLESTEIN

| and @OHEN was instrumental in maneuvering in picking the
slate. The slate itself includes two SWP members, one former
ISL member, two CP members and one leader of the Socialist
Party - Social Democratic Federation, out of a total proposed
Chicago Branch delegation of nine members.

Jvronmev7_ The Co-Ordinating Committee strategy, according to
Ice 6066-S,} is that at the meeting at which the Chicago Chapter
i delegation is selected, they will pack the meeting with 75 to
' 80 of their group which is considered enough to swing the
| vote in favor of their delegates. The Co-ordinating Committee
! is to concentrate on working for the nine named delegates as
| delegates rather than alternates as it assumes the regular .
NAACP organization will have its votes split further in
selecting both delegates and alternates.

\ Experience has shown that only 100 people attend
a NAACP meeting of this type. Therefore, the Co-ordinating
Committee feels that by having approximately 75 of its people

at the meeting it will sweep the election of delegates to
the National Convention and this in turn will open the door
for a sweep of the 12/59 elections for the leadership of the
Chicago Branch.

Observations and Proposals

7 Reliable informants have reported that the strength
of the CP in the leadership of the NAACP, Chicago Branch,
today is at its lowest ebb. Within the past several weeks
the CP fraction for work within the NAACP has been working
intensively and diligently to organize and to broaden its
strength in the leadership of the Chicago Branch of the

IAACP by defeating JONES as well as to increase its strength
in or at least change the leadership of the National Office
of the NAACP. If the Co-ordinating Committee objective of
election of its slate of delegates from the Chicago Branch
to the National Convention is successful, it will result in
a major accomplishment of CP organizational efforts in the
Negro field in that the NAACP in Chicago alone has approxi-
mately 20,000 members. .

With these facts in mind and in considering that
THEODORE A. JONES is an intelligent and able leader with a
political machine of Congressman WILLIAM DAWSON to back him
up, it is felt that if he were put to notice of the existence
of this caucus and slate he could defeat the CP in its
efforts to attempt to get control of. thé Chicago Branch and
also of its efforts to gain greater influence in the national
picture of the NAACP. As indicated previously as late as
4/29/59 when JONES visited this office/he was unaware of
any organized resistance to his leadership although he
recognized individual dissatisfaction among the members as
a result of their statements at Branch meetings.

It is felt that a counterintelligence gain that
will hurt the CP can be had with complete security insofar
as the Bureau is concerned and the following is suggested:

That Chicago be permitted to prepare a letter for
anonymous mailing to THEODORE A. JONES, President of the
Chicago Branch, NAACP, at the earliest possible date to make
him aware of the existence of this organized faction as
well as to the existence of the slate of candidates backed
by the group of individuals in opposition to the present
policies and leadership of the national and Chicago Branch,
NAACP.

This letter will be written in longhand in the
lenguage of an individual who would be a member of the
NAACP.

Dear President Jones:

I am a member of the Chicago Branch and voted for
you. I know of your troubles with the Communists. I want
Communists out of the Branch. Yesterday,.a Branch member
saw me and asked me to vote for a list of people to go
to our National Convention in New York. I thought the dele-
gates were to be elected on May 22. This person said the
list is already made up. I saw the list and I think some
of them are Communists. Two names I remember are Davis and
a woman named Meyer. I am sure you don't want them in our
Branch. The person told me that ‘the real leaders are Bullock
and Cohen and they have 75 votes already. They tell me
Reverend Griffin is supposed to run this thing but others
are behind him.

I will be there on May 22 to vote against them.
God bless you.

Expeditious consideration is requested for the

of May 22. The Bureau is assured that this counterintelligence
item can be handled with full security to the Bureau.
Further, that should it succeed, and it is believed JONES,
through his organizational efforts will make it succeed,
the counterintelligence item would serve as a great defeat
for the CP.

minute effort to marshal and direct "left caucus" voting

strength to 7415 Cottage Grove Avenue.

When "left caucus" people arrived at the 74.15 Cottage
Grove address, they experienced "a real blow". JONES had
packed the meeting with members of the United Steel Workers

The JONES slate was elected easily, by such a margin
that the highest "left caucus" vote-getter badly trailed the
lowest JONZS candidate. . ;

the "left caucus" defeat badly jarred caucus morale; to such /*amaw7—

The Chicago Division feels that it, through counter-

"left caucus" for the following reasons:

1) The Negro press at Chicago two days before and the
city press one day before monthly NAACP membership meetings,
always carry conspicuously the monthly NAACP meeting site.
That information wes on the occasion in point withheld from
the press.

2) Tho information as to,the monthly NAACP meeting site
has always been available inthe past the day before the meeting
through the NAACP leadership; yet on this occasion, throstof
the "left caucus" who attempted to get ormation regarding
the meeting site got only, according to}¢G 14S} double talk

defeat of the "left caucus", an attempt by the CP to infiltrate
a "right led" mass organization.

Based on the results of the above and because of the
broad CP program of infiltration of mass organizations, it is
felt that this incident has demonstrated that the Bureau's
Counterintelligence Program can successfully be extended to
cover CP programs in "right led" organizations.

The Bureau may desire to advise the field of the
additional counterintelligence possibilities offered in the
matter of the counteracting of Communist influence in mass
organizations.

It is felt that with careful planning and implementation,
the Bureau's Counterintelligence Program can be further extended
to obtain additional effective results.

__-&As outlined in referenced letter, the "left
caucus" Was “buried in an avalanche of JONES' votes”
in its May,4959 effort. After its set pack in May,
1959, the "left caucus" appraised she” position. astutely
and f began quietly to build an organization.

~

During the summer of 1959 “while regular NAACP
activity at Chicago was curtailed, the "left caucus"
set up a regular schedule of meetings, increased its
membership, elected a leadership and acquired funds.
The "left-.caucus" also recruited vigorously new NAACP
members at Chicago who were ideologically allied with the‘
“left caucus".

After organizing carefully from June to

October, 1959 and baiting JONES continuaily during that
period, the "left caucus" in October, 1959, dealt the
current Chicago NAACP leadership, headed Dy THEODORE JONES,
two jarring blows: 1) The entire "left caucus" slate

of delegates was elected to represent the Chicago NAACP
Branch at the 10/59 Illinois State Convention. JGNES,
though the leader of Illinois' most influential NAACP
Branch, was not even elected a delegate to the organization's
state convention; 2) The "left caucus" Slate was elected
in toto in the annual NAACP nominating committee election.
This nominating committee is the Key to NAACP elections
because it selects those names which will appear on the
. ballot at the annual December Chicago Branch NAACP election.

Among those elected to the nominating committee
of eight were MILTON COHEN and LESTER. DAVIS, members of the
Illinois State CP Committee, FRITHE ENGLESTEIN, Illinois
CP member, BARNEY TAYLOR, SWP member, SAUL MENDELSON,
former member of the Independent Socialist League National
,Committee, This nominating committeefhas a chairman wi who is

NAACP President JONES is reportedly disgusted
and tired of fighting the “left caucus" and seems about

: at has been learned t at the "left caucus"

dominated nominating committee, while supposedly going
to nominate a slate acceptable to both JONES and the
"Left caucus", a "harmony slate", will at the last
possible. instant on November 27, 1959, the day’ the ballot
is drawn up, nominate "left caucus" leader GERALD BULLOCK,
whom JONES reportedly despises. BULLOCK will reportedly
be supported by former Chicago NAACP President WILLOUGHBY
ABNER, an enemy of JONES, whom JONES defeated in the
Chicago NAACP Branch Presidential election of 1957. The
"left caucus" feels that the BULLOCK-ABNER coalition

. Will win easily not only because of its strength perse,
but primarily due to the fact that its existence will not
become known to JONES until the last minute on November 27,
1959 when itsis too late for JONES to rally his forces.

It should be noted that in October, 1959,
Illinois CP Chairman CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT said that the
"immediate task"of the Illinois CP is to recruit members
for the Chicago NAACP before November 11, 1959. LIGHTFOOT
said that new HAACP recruits who are signed up before
November 11, 1959, will be eligible to vote in the
December 11, 1959 Chicago NAACP election and that thus
the CP can play a prominent behind-the-scenes role in the
December, 1959 Chicago NAACP election,

¥Oa November 7, 1959,LESTER DAVIS,in addressing
South Side Chicago CP leaders, said that "the NAACP
at Chicago can be altered by changing the rotten leadership....
We are within grasp of victory....We.are well nigh in a
position to exercise control of NAACP at Chicago."

Observations and Proposals

. Based on the preceding information, it would
appear that the "left caucus" of NAACP seems in an
excellent position to take over the NAACP at Chicago.
Unless President THEODORE JONES can somehow be energized
to marshal his followers ai campaign aggressively, it
“appears that the CP, by using the "left caucus" and directing
CP members in the "left caucus", will achieve a
Significant degree of control of NAACP at Chicago.

Informant advised that JONES' reaction upon
receiving this information was one of surprise and anger.
He promptly stated that although he did not intend to be a
candidate for re-election as President of the Chicago
Branch and had planned to take a cooperdtive and amenable
attitude toward the “harmony slate" being prepared by the
Nominating Committee, he now saw the need for direct
action in support of candidates of his own choosing in
the Branch election. He said he was considering two or three
individuals who might be strong candidates for President,
and that one of these would receive the unqualified and
active support of himself and his followers.

The following information concerning, the recent
developments in this matter was received from]CG 14-S
on 12/2/59: Ud bo tend

Within a few days, after a meeting by JONES with
his supporters, he flatly rejected the "harmony slate"
which was offered by the Nominating Committee. Further,
at a meeting of the "left caucus" a‘decision was made that
the caucus would support a full slate of candidates which
included GERALD BULLOCK for President, LOLA BELLE HOLMES
for Secretary, and LESTER DAVIS and SAUL MENDELSON as
Executive Board.members. DAVIS is a current member of the
Illinois State Committee of the Communist Party (CP) and
HOLMES is an Illinois CP member. MENDELSON is a former
member of the National Committee of the Independent
Socialist League, now defunct.

The JONES forces also prepared a slate which
included DEMPSEY TRAVIS, a well-known Negro realtor for
President, WILLIE THOMAS for First Vice President, ETHEL
DOSTAL for Secretary, and JAMES KEMP for Treasurer. TRAVIS
is a candidate personally selected by JONES, and the others
named are incumbents who are strong supporters of JONES.

KEMP is-one_of JONES' first lieutenants and the source of
much of his following among trade union members. JONES,
himself, is a candidate for the Executive Board on this
slate. 7

At a meeting of the Chicago Branch on 11/27/59,
the most important business was the election of a three
man Election Supervisory Committee to serve at the Branch
election on 12/11/59. The duties of this Committee are
to control procedures connected with the distribution of
the ballots and, in the past, the Committee has also super-
vised the counting of the ballots. This meeting was calkd
by JONES in a union hall near 74th Street and Cottage Grove
and his opponents accused him of choosing this hail because
he would be able to marshal additional support from Chicago
NAACP members who are trade unionists and who normally
moamanfeongregate there for recreational purposes. According to
Tee 14-S,] there were over 200 members present at this meeting
and the eomposition of the membership present at first
‘ indicated that the supporters of the "left caucus" enjoyed
a slight numerical advantage. With JONES presiding, the
\ meeting was temporarily delayed beanie additional members
from JONES' camp arrived.

Both sides offered three candidates for the
Election Supervisory Committee and each side named three
tellers to count the votes. It had been indicated that
there were about 220 members present but after 220 balicts
were counted there were still a large number of uncounted
ballots remaining. This brought a sharp protest from SAUL
MENDELSON, a leading member of the "left caucus" who was
serving as a teller for the caucus. One of the JONES tellers
insisted that he had counted at least 300 members present
and the counting of the ballots was continued after a
ruling by JONES.

When the vote count passed 265 and there were
still a substantial number of uncounted ballots, MENDELSON

became extremely angry and challenged the legality of the
election. JONES ruled against him. MENDELSON then seized
both the counted and uncounted ballots. and threw them out

into the crowd, scattering the ballots on the floor.

After the confusion subsided, JONES, as Chairman,
ruled that MENDELSON had forfeited the election by his
action. He then announced that JAMES KEMP, THEODORE
CALLION, and AMY VICTOR, the candidates of the JONES forces,
had been elected to the Election Supervisory Committee
for the December Branch election of officers. JONES then
adjourned the meeting and left the hall.

These developments left the meeting in an uproar
and GERALD BULLOCK took the floor and drafted a telegram
of protest to ROY WILKINS, National NAACP leader, which was
signed by BULLOCK and at least ten others. The telegram
demanded supervision of the Chicago Branch election in
December ‘py impartial representatives of the NAACP National
Office.

In a meeting of he" lett caucus" held on 12/1/59,
the major activity was the composition of a long letter
to the national leadership of the NAACP which included a
statement that a copy of the letter was being sent to the
local press. It was expected that this letter might influence
WILKINS to take action as requested by the "left caucus" in
supervising the forthcoming Branch election. Some considera~
tion was also given to a proposal that an attempt be made
to obtain an injunction of some type against the JONES
forces. No final decision was made on this proposal at
that time. :

Observations and Conclusions

‘Although pertinent developments in this matter

have been set forth above, it is not possible to predict

the outgome of the 12/11/59 election at this time. However,
CG 14-S fhas pointed out that if the Election Supervisory
mmittee composed of JONES supporters is permitted to
function at the Branch election, the "left caucus" will be
faced with a very limited possibility of success. As an
indication that the [Illinois Party leadership is concerned
about this development, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT recently instructed
both DAVIS and HOLMES to seriously consider remaining in
Chicago for the election in spite of the fact that they
are scheduled to accompany the Illinois delegation to the
CP National Convention on the same weekend.

From the developments to date, it is apparent

that JONES did take immediate and aggressive action in

mobilizing his forces for the 11/27/59 Branch meeting. In
addition, he rejected the "harmony slate" supported by

the "left caucus" and presented a slate of his own candidates
for Branch officers. These were the immediate objectives

of the Chicago office in initiating this counterintelligence
activity as set forth in re airtel of 11/19/59.

The Bureau will be promptly advised of any

additional pertinent developments, including the final
outcome of the 12/11/59 Chicago Branch NAACP elections.

ing of the baliots. The November 27, 1959, meeting was called by Jones in
a union hall near 74th Street and Cottage Grove in Chicago and his oppo-

additional support from Chicago NAACP members who are trade unionists and

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM
INTERNAL SECURITY - ¢C

100-3-104 -

the supporters of the "left caucus" enjoyed a slight numerical advantage.
Jones, who was presiding, delayed the meeting until additional Jones sup-
porters arrived. Both sides then offered three candidates for the Election
Supervisory Committee: It had been indicated that there’ were about 220
members present at the meeting. When the vote count passed 265 and there
was still a substantial number of uncounted ballots, Saul Mendelson, a lead-
ing member of the "left caucus" who was serving as a teller for the caucus,
became extremely angry and challenged the legality of the election. Jones
ruled against him and Mendelson then seized both. the counted and uncounted
pallots and threw them out into the crowd, scattering the ballots on the
floor. After the confusion subsided, Jones, as chairman, ruled that
Mendelson had forfeited the election by his action and then announced that
the candidates representing the Jones forces had been elected to the Electic
Supervisory Committee. Jones then adjourned the meeting and left the hall.
These developments left the meeting in an uproar and Gerald Bullock, who is
to be the "left caucus" candidate for president of the Chicago Branch, took
the floor and drafted a telegram of protest to Ray Wilkins, national NAACP
leader, which was signed by Bullock and at least 10 others. The telegram
demanded supervision of the Chicago Branch election on December 11, 1959, by
impartial representatives of the NAACP national office.

to JONES of the “Left Caucus" plan to double cross
him, JONES emerged from his lethargy and went into
action.

JONES used the technique "first things first"
and from 11/24/59, to 11/27/59, he concentrated on
defeating the "Left Caucus" attempt to gaim control of
the Election Supervisory Committee. JONES’ first goal
was achieved during the turbulent meeting of 11/27/59,
(Chicago airtel of 12/3/59). 7

From 11/28/59, to 12/11/59, JONES, with apparently
only his most intimate lieutenants as confidants, planned
the following strategy which was put into practice on
12/11/59, and resulted in the routing of the "Left Caucus"y

JONES reportedly in early December, 1959,
although a strong Republican,entered into an alliance
with the strong Chicago South Side Democratic Organization
for the purpose of defeating the "Left Caucus". As the
election process began at approximately 8:30 p.m. on
12/11/59, the South Side Democratic Organization held
tight control of the balloting process. Democratic
ward committeemen, »precinct captains and their followers
were located strategically at each phase of the election
process. The Democratic Organization 'got out'the vote
and despite the fact that a torrential rain storm occurred
on the evening of 12/11/59, the Democratic Organization
"brought® in"enough people to insure JONES' victory
by a.wide margin. ‘

JONES also struck a paralyzing psychological
blow at the "Left Caucus", Any "Left Caucus" thought
of disrupting the meeting was removed quickly because
on approaching the polling place the first sight visible
through the intense rain was the flashing red lights
of police vehicles, Inside eight uniformed policemen
directed by a police sergeant circulated continvdllyand
by their presence thwarted any latent disruptionist
tendencies of the "Left Caucus". The election was run
in an efficient businesslike manner and was directed
by an NAACP official appointed by the NAACP leadership.
At the completion of the balloting, the "Left Caucus"

Observations and Conclusions

Without the use of the counterintelligence tactic
i sanctionin Bureau teletype of 11/23/59, it is felt
‘that the "Left Caucus" would possibly have taken over
NAACP at Chicago or certainly gained a powerful voice
in Chicago NAACP affairs by successfully gaining a
mwf number of elective positions. As late as 11:00 a.m.
on 12/11/59, [CG 14-SJadvised the Chicago Division that
oe — on 2/21/59-1g ose vantage point, deemed the election's

results "a toss up". It is also felt by the Chicago amasT
Division that the use of any lesser counterintelligence /”
‘technique would have failed badly. 14-Slhas advised

that undoubtedly the "leak" of the impending "Left Caucus"
double cross so jolted JONES that JONES dropped everything
and set out to defeat the "Left Caucus". The result

of using the counterintelligence tactic in point seens to
be that for the year 1960, NAACP at Chicago will have
outspoken anti-Communist leadership to the consternation
of Illinois CP Chairman CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT who designated
NAACP at Chicago as the point of CP concentration for
mass organizational work. It is noted that LIGHTFOOT

had assigned. several Illinois CP members, including two
Illinois CP District Committeemen to the allout task

of taking over NAACP at Chicago by means of a "Left
Caucus" victory in the 12/11/39, NAACP Election at Chicago.

Vis far as the informant fengnes HALL is ase

personally acquainted with LUTHER KING, and was not fully aware of
KING's pro-Communist leanings until recently, when LEVISON,
through LEM HARRIS, sent HALL a report on KING, and LEVISON's
close association with KING. Although not impossible, it is in-

‘ consistent that HALL in New York would write a speech for KING,
whom, until recently; he knew little about as regards the

y;past that HALL, in preparing to give a speec} -has submitted the

deas to people such as JAKES ALLEN, MICHAEL? DAVIDOW and ARNOLD

‘Y OHNSON, who actually write the speech. It:is therefore, in the
informant's opinion, highly imprebable that HALL wrote the
speech in question. What adds to the improbability is the

fact that poe is geoo busy to engage in such acti Vi boys aml

(eee a may have said to another sourcé with regard
to his being the author of the said speech must be interpreted
in the light of HALL's character and motives. HALL is a pompous,
rconceited, arrogant individual and may have taken credit for the
speech to enhance his own prestige. Or, inasmuch as he may
have wished to protect LEVISON, a secret Party member, he may
have assumed personal responsibility for KING's speech. The
third possibility in this regard is that HALL, in mentioning
this matter to another source, may have used the editorial "we"
referring to the speech as having been prepared by the Party.

The sougce may have reported the pronoui a ae "I" instead oe "we"

headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia. When a branch of that

On March 9, 1961, a source advised that the New

(NYCAUAC), 150 West 34th Street, New York City, New York,
was formed at a meeting held in New York City on November 17,
1960. This organization was founded principally throvgh the
efforts of FRANK WILKINSON, Field Representative of the
National Committee To Apolish the Un-American Activities
Committee (NCAUAC) . I. :

A second source advised on September 17, 1952,
that FRANK WILKINSON was a Communist Party member as of
September, 1952.

The "National quardian" in January 16; ‘1961,
issue, page 7, column 1,'contained an article which states
that the NYCAUAC has only one objective: "to help the
National Committee as vigorously as possible in its
endeavors to mobilize the American people in a campaign
to abolish the House Committee on Un-Amerio#n Activa ties.

A third source furnished on March 9, 1961, a
prospectus of the NCAUAC prepared principally by FRANK
WILKINSON, which in reference to "local abolition committees"
Stated-that these committees may identify and egordinate
their efforts as closely as they desire with NCAUAC, still
maintaining their autonomy for as flexible and independent
program as possible. The prospectus also stated that the
NYCAUAC was responsible fer coordinating abolition activities

-on the Atlantic coast. '

Various sources have advised in writ, 1961, that
Communist Party members in the New York City area have been
solicited to support activities of the NYCQUAC during

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE

The Southern Patriot, a monthly publication, shows

June 12, oe .

The SCHW was cited < as a communist front by the

An amendment to ‘the ‘charter of the SCHW changed
the name of that organization to the SCEF, and listed its

_ purpose as being to improve the educationai and cultural

standards of the Southern people in accordance with the
highest American democratic institutions, traditions, and
ideals. The amendment was dated April 26, 1946.

A source, who is familiar with some phases of
Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised on
May 15, 1961, that during the time the SCHW was in existence,
Communist Party (CP) members were members of and worked
actively in the SCHW. However, since the formation of the
SCEF, rank and file CP membershave not been encouraged to
work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is a
progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a CP
front organization because it has gone along with the CP
on certain issues, particularly on the racial question, and
through the years, certain CP members in the New Orleans
area have been assigned to work in the organization to further.
CP principles.

On May 15, 1961, the source advised that in the past
he has considered JAMES DOMBROWSKI, the Executive Director
of the SCEF, to..be a Communist, if not an actual CP member,
because he followed communist principles.

A backing: for encouragement for this movement. She stated it was her

~Spinion that if the subject was not a CP member, he waS close to
being one as it seemed his feelings on many issues were similar

to the stand of the CP. She continued, however, that the subject
was very clever in his manner of presentation of these issues so

DONALD L. WEST, a Georgian with a long record of affiliations with

The Southern Patriot was cited as an " organ" of the
Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW) by the Committee on
Un-American Activities, House Report 592, on the SCHW, June 12, 1947.

cane! The SCHW was cited as a communist front by the Committee
on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 16, 1947.

An amendment to the chartér of the SCHW changed the name
of that organization to the SCEF, and listed its purpose as being
to improve the educational and cultural standards of the Southern
people in accordance with the highest American democratic institu-
viens, traditions, and ideals. The amendment was dated April 26,
1946. :

A source, who is familiar with some phases of Communist
Party (CP) activity in the New Orleans area, advised on May 22, 1959,
that during the time the SCHY was in existence, CP members were
members of and worked actively in the SCHW. However, since the
formation of the SCEF, rank and file CP members have not been
encouraged to work in.the SCEF, The source stated that the SCEF is
a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a CP front
organization because it has gone along with the CP on certain
issues, particularly on the racial question, and through the years,
certain CP members in the New Orleans area have been assigned to
work in the organization to further CP principles.

. On May 22, 1959, the source advised that in the past he

has considered JAMES DOMBROWSKI, the Executive Director of the SCEF,
to be a Communist, if not an actual Communist Party member, because
he followed communist principles. 7

The source also advised on May 22, 1959, that many people
who are officials and members of the SCEF, while liberal in their
views, are by no means communists.

WOMEN'S PEACE AND UNITY CLUB, formerly
known as the Chicago Women for Peace

The aims and purposes of the Chicago Women for Peace (CWE) 5
as set forth in its self-identified publication, "Chicago Acts for
Peace” (CAP), May; 1951, issue, describes this organization as a

"service center for women working for peace." This publication
described the Chicago Women for Peace as being affiliated with
the American Women for Peace and as co-operating with the American
Peace Crusade.

The January, 1954, issue of "CAP" announced the dissolution
or the American Women for Peace and the affiliation of the Chicago
Women for Peace with the American Peace Crusade Council in Chicago.

A source advised in November, 1956, that the CWP remained
affiliated with the American Peace Crusade, Chicago, until that
organization dissolved in September, 1955. The CWP continued with
no national affiliation until September, 1956, when a "re-organization
and name change took place", and it became known as the “women's
Peace and Unity Club" (weuc). The reason given for this "re-
organization and name change" by DOROTHY HAYES, Secretary of the Fl
organization, was that the CWP had been formed to end the Korean War
and since that war was over and there was a "measure of peace in the
world", women's interests were more centered on such issues as civil
rights, desegregated and better schools, juvenile delinquency, equal
opportunities for women, housing, and cost of living. Source
advised that the only actual "re-organization" of the CUP was the
change of its name to "Women's Peace and Unity Club",

Another source advised in October, 1956, that the cP,
Illinois-Indiana District, had ordered the dissolution of the CWP
because it no longer served the purpose of the Party, since it was -

a "Left-wing" peace group. ‘Though the CWP refused to dissolve and
chose to continue in the form of the "Women's Peace and Unity Club,"
it continues to be a "Communist front organization" whose policies
and activities are directed by DOROTHY HAYES, a known CP member.

The previous source advised on May 7, 1959, that the
WPUC continues to operate in the Chicago area as a peace organization
under the same leadership and with the same objectives. :

‘February 12, 1959, a Secialist Workers Party (SWP) minority
group, under the leadership of national committee member
Sam Ballan, known in the SWP as Sam Marcy, split from the
SWP.

The source stated that this minority_group referred
tc as the Marcyites, after many years of program and policy
gifferences oii varied issues concerning tactics and inter-
pretation of political events, split from the SWP on the
grounds that the Party was liguidating itself by departing
from the Marxist precepts of Leon Trotsky and retréating
from the fight for the world socialist revolution. The
final issue which ultimately forced the split was the minority's
opposition to the SWP regroupment policy which involved
cooperation with the Communist Party (CP) periphery -
eee characterized by the minority as petiy-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,
advocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union
and has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party
with a complete proletarian orientation for the purpose
bed overthrowing capitalism in the United States and throughout
ie world,

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this
minority group had ghosen the name Workers World Party with

17th National Convention of the CP in December, 1959. In May,
1960, Lav 694-S* reported that CP policy then was to concentrate:
on Martin Luther King and the CP felt it was to the Party's
advantage\to assign outstanding Party members té.work with the
Martin Luther King group. As late as 11-21-61 the Atlanta Office
has advised no information has been developed on which to base
a security inquiry on SCLC. In view of the continued activity
of Levison and 0'Dell and the fact they exert influence on King ~
it is deemed advisable to again ask for a review of the appropriate
field office files to determine if any cP direction and infiltra-
tion of the SCLC has developed.

New York. During this contact BOGAN made available the CRB

AT 100-5718

of STANLEY LEVISON, Attorney at Law, 6 East 39th Street,

New York 18, N. Y. In this letter LEVISON requested to be
furnished anapplication for registration “by a committee

in organization to be known as Appeal for Human Dignity Now."

One photostat of the registration statement of the
AFHDN bearing #9535 received by the CRB on 6/5/61 reflects
the AFHDN solicited under the slogan "Dollars for Human
Dignity" and seeks to provide financial assistance to the
movement for desegregation and achievement for equal rights
under the Constitution. The statement indicates there will
be emphasis on giving more assistance to the SCLC of Atlanta,
Georgia, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ~~
of Atlanta, Georgia. Page'three of the registration statement
contains the name of STANLEY D, LEVISON as co-chairman of
the AFHDN.

The following security sources of information were
contacted on 10/8/62 and they had no information regarding
any Communist Infiltration of the SCLC. These sources are
all familiar with some activities ‘of SCLC through their work
in the desegregation field:

that he had no information concerning Communist Infiltration
into SCLC.

It is recommended that a Cominfil investigation be
authorized by the Bureau in view of information furnished by
the New York Office in their letter to the Bureau dated 8/21/62
in addition to that information set out above.

DocId:32989672 Page 150



AT 100-5712

It is not contemplated there would be any need for
investigation by Savannah at the Dorchester Center, McIntosh
‘County, Georgia. The only CP member known to be active
there was O'DELL and that was for a short period of time

in early 1962.

There is no indication that any investigation would
|be made in this matter in the Mobile Division.

New Orleans, if investigation authorized by the
Bureau, should determine whether a SCLC branch has been
established in your division. If so, ,whether CAULFIELD,
UDSGN or other CP members formed or control it or have
any great influence on its activities.

It is obvious thatallCP infiltration or influence
known at this time is either in New York City or emanates
from there. The only CP member who is known to be an officer
of SCLC is HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, He divides his time between
his position of head of SCLC branch office in New York City
and his duties at Atlanta Headquarters, All of his known
CP contacts are in New York City with the exception of 7
SARGEANT CAULFIELD in Louisiana. :

Mr. Jack H, O'Dell

488 St. Nicholas Avenue
Apartment 5-S

New York, New York

Dear J ack;

Several months ago you submitted your resignation pending an
investigation of your alleged affiliation with the Communist
party, As was suggeated by an article to this effect in the
Birmingham and New Orleans newspapers. We accepted this
temporary resignation beczuse of SCLC's firm policy that no
Communist nor Communist sympathizer can be on our staff or
in our membership. We felt that it was imperative to conduct
an immediate investigation. As you know, we conducted what we
felt to be a thorough inquiry into these charges and were unable
to discover any present connections with the Communiat party on
your part,

The situation in our country is such, however, that any silusion
to the left brings forth an emotional response which would seem
to indicate that SCLC and the Southern Freedom Movement are
Communist inspired. In these critical times we cannot afford to
tisk any such impressions. We, therefore, have decided in our
Administrative Committees, that we should request you to maks
your temporary resignation permanent.

We certainly appreciate the yeare of unselfish service which you
have put into our New York Office, and regret the necessity of

monourate with the sufferings in jail and through loss of jobs
under raciet intimidation. We all pray for the day whea our
nation may be truly the land of the free.

% is prepared in response to your request and és not for dissemi-
2 vor Comméiticn, Its use is Limited to official proceedings by
your tee G:.1 the eoutent may not be disclosed to unauthorized person-
nel without the express approval of the FBI .
