Contact Report

i 2. On the morning of 28 July, I called Sam to check in with hin

i after. being away on TOY for alzost 6 weexs. ‘He sounded a bit
: . beset at not being contacted during this period, so I dashed

: out to his Hollywood home to explain what had happened and set

him at ease,

2. it was plain. to see that the trip had changed him. He 1g now
a bit presumptuous, cocky, and know it all James Sond. He told
me all.sorts of wild stories, about’ be{ng tailed in. Madrid "by
7,0F 8.'Chivatos' (Castro agents," and leading them on long

Habe ~N8 or 9 mile hikes through Madrid.” Castro ageats were also

“watching" him on the day he was in Barcelona and on the short
jayover his Pan Am plane’had in Lisbon on his way home. At no
time, however, was he molested by these “agents,”

j 3, The Castro surveillance continued -so Sam says~ in Hollywood.
"About the second night after I got home," cy 14-15 June, a car
parked across the street and a little to the rear of his “house
Nafter it got dark." When Sam got into his car and went to the
gas station, the car -described as looking like a white Volxswagea,
without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trip in

the neighborhood and back to -his home. He could not make out

the physical description of the driver of the Vw. He has-never~
seen this car again.

4+ The only other suspicious individual near his home, was “a . 21,
thin man," (described as.about 5-11 to 6 ft and 170 lbs; dla
hair; no distinguishing features visible; once wearing slac
white shirt, another tine wearing a suit}. ‘This individual showed

up across the street from his home "just as the sun had gone down,

b. To exchange addresses and telephone
numbers for the purpose of ‘Sending occasional.

¢. To invite AMAUTO-1 (and his wife, if i
necessary) to dinner, at his expense.

4. To ascertain AMAUTO-1's. future ‘plans.

e. To assess ANAUTO-1's feelings toward
the United States and toward his own government, 1

f, to talk favorably abowt the
United States using himself as an example, (the
son of immigrant parents who made good in’ business) ;

to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone
with imagination, ambition and aggressiveness.

&. If the opportunity presented itself,

to show sympathy for the apparent failure of the
"Cuban Government to reach the 10 million ton

Sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment

of this goal would adversely affect the economic

development of Cuba. It was our hope that some-
time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would
volunteer to discuss his country's economic

situation which might have opene conversation
to further exploitation by

h. Paralle? with objective e. above] i
Was instructed to ask (provided an appropriate opening
appeared in the conversation) AMAUTO-1 for his
personal comments on the Vietnam issue and anti-war
demonstrations in the United States and abroad, We
were trying to draw out AMAUTO-1's personal analysis
of the U.S. position vis-a-vis the war in Vietnam
and to compare his stateménts with the Cuban Government
position . :

3. Arcnougn[ ]sas determined to see AMAUTO-1 even
if he had to camp “outside AMALTO-1's home, we reminded hin

The pictures were taken from the home of one of our staffers.

We believe they highlight the events leading to the reunioa E

of these two old friends. The; following is ‘a description :
of each photo: Ht : i

The maid accepts the note and returns to the :

calls out, "Bill, don't you remenber me,

goes toward and they embrace. (The
driveway slants toward the house and from our :
observation post we could not see the embrace.)

F; . AMAUTO-1 accompanies into the house,
arm in arm, As they go tells AMAUTO-1 that

he put on weight and asked where his boy was.
AMAUTO-1 replies that he's rich because all
these kids are his (pointing to the three boys)

He pleaded with SACODER to do something to-keep him in the hotel
room or risk losing -the opportunity to lunch with AMAUTO-1
because AMAUTO~1 was to call him at the hotel on Saturday,
6 June. SACODER admitted the error but added that there was
a simple solution if he could not convince the hotel manage
ment to allow him to stay a few more days, SACODER suggested
that he should explain to the manager that 1) his laundry had
not yet returned and 2) he was expecting an important phone
call on Saturday and that there was no way of getting in touch
with the caller, Failing this, SACODER offered another simple
solution. — Since jand AMAUTO-1 had not yet exchanged
addresses, could return to the AMAUTO-1 home and give
the maid a note advising AMAUTO-1 that he had to change hotels.

2.- On the morning of: 6 June -AMAUTO-1's-wife called =
and, in English, said that her husband would pick him
up at 1400-hours--in- front of thelotel. At ‘the appointed
hour, .AM\UTO-1's .official-vehicle pulled up in nt of the
hotel driven by a chauffeur. AMAUTO-1 yrceted in front
of the hotel and after exchanging a few words, they departed
for a nearby restaurant, }kas too preoccupied to make
note of the name of the restaurant. We decided against any
surveillance during he AMAUTO-1 meeting to avoid alerting
.AMAUTO-1 and/or his staff that the visit

(it is interesting to note reaction

first visited: AMAUTO-1 on 31 May, he was
certain that under the facade of being a
devoted revolutionary AMAUTO-1 was indeed a

list at heart, but at this meeting

B. AMAUTO-1 proposed thad jact as an

the Cubans have a large fishing fleet in
the Canary Islands, The fish caught is
processed in the Canary Islands and can be
shipped to the United States as a product
of Spain, not of Cuba. AMAUTO-1 added,

attitude toward this Embassy concerning her

circumstances of her presence in Spain - not. as
a 'gusano' but cs the wife of a foreign doctor
who has worked in our country - we saw no
“difficulty to'prevent her from returning, especially
taking into account the fact that she expressed —
herself as a revolutionary, ‘but that first we ~
had to receive official permission.

“In our opinion, ‘because the situation in
which she finds herself in Spain because of
marriage to a foresper, her return can be

Assessment:  Subject's prosent position; tha positions, all of them
important ,which he has held before; and the fact that
he has been reported as a DGI officer, lead us to be~

in-an attempt to recruit or defect Subject. The fact
that Subject's fathor has been a militant Comunist:
since prior to 1959 and that Subject's wife has been
reported as a supporter of the xoginze should not be

forgotten,

Subject‘s revolutionary background during the struggle
against BATISTA soemsa to indicate that he is in favor
of acts of terrorism. This gave him knowledge and ex=
perience in matters related to subversive activities

Therefore, we believa that Orastes Guillermo RUIZ Pa~
rez must be a very useful person for the Cuban regime,

monts and in handling administrative affairs (he has
beon working in this field for more than ten years).
All this knowledge and exporience added to his know

affairs make him a man who is not often found in the
