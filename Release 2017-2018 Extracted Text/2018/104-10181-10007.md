On the morning of 28 july, i called Sam to check in with hin

aster. being

away on Thy for alrost 6 weeks.

He sounded a bit

upset at

not being contacted.during this period, so I dashed

out to his Hollywood home to explain what had happened and set

him at ease:

-It was plain. to see that the trip had changed him.

He is now

a bit presumptuous; cocky, and know it all James Sond.

He told

Castro agents were, also

"watching" him on the day he was in Barcelona

and on the

short

layover his Pan im plane had in Lisbon on his way home. At no

time, however, was he nolested by these "agents.'

The Castro surveillance continued -so San says- in Hollywood.

"About the second night after I got home, "

parked across the street and a little to

Then Sam got into his car and went to the

He could not make out

the physical description of the driver of the Vi.

has not experienced any othe: suspicious incidents after the first

week home from Spain.

I should note that San does not tali of

these incidents with fear,, but ratheriin the vein of a paperbac

detective story.

Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himself somerhat in Madrid as

a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxury hotel,

ate as well as drank well, san the sites and even went to a nicht

club,

all on the house.

ie went so far as to sav that if he had

"but, only to help ay country." (with "patriots" lixe Sar, how

can se iose.)

Sam is most anxious to start some correspondence to "'illlar."

He say's

"willian" asted him to send him some photos of cape kennedy

some smoked shriag.

Sam wants to know if we want to supply

him with photos of are Cape that he can send.

Sam states he will

on a job werr done; which is: true.

• He

liked that very much; you could see it in the smile on his face.

He träes to make it sound like it was a great ordeal and sacrifice

on his part to go to spain to see

"willian,

" but be: cannot hide

his anxiety to get on the next plane to ladrid, and the 30od life there.

I pointed out that

"william" is now back in Cuba and there is no

indication of when he nill return.

Neve-theless,

Sam feels he

should

write him

"because the letter will be sent to Cuba to him."

I assured him that I bould get a reading on this matter and have

an answe= for him sometime noxt week.

it that tine,

I promised. to

take him and his close friend

to lunch.

San gave me an

extensive and expensive expente account of his trip.

I will attempt

to decipher it at the close of this report.

We ended the meeting on very cordial terms.

He was not so mad at

not being contacted so such as he is dying. to get back on the gravy

train,

and so much time has passed by without word to or 1zo.

"Millian."

Sam asked io= some way in which he can contact us

"right away" if

"willias" notifies him "chat he's ready to jump.

You know when he jumos he won't have much time."

I pointed out

that at present "willian" is in Cuba and the prospects of hin

desecting from. Cuba right now are very slin indeed.

He would, horever,

take

this into consideration after

"william" returns to Spain or

another foreign post.

we will be seeing each other next week to

clear up the accounting (re ove him money, he says) and have lunch.

from the United States.

C..

To invite ANAUTO-1 (and his wife, 1f

d. To ascertain ABAUTO-l's. future plans.

To assess ANAUTO-1's feelings toward

the United States and toward his own government.

1.

to talk favorably about the

United States using himself as an example, (the

son of immigrant parents who made good in

business) ;

to emphasize the opportunities

available to anyone

with imagination, ambition and aggressiveness:

g.

If the opportunity presented itself,

to show sympathy for the

apparent failure of

Cuban Government to reach

the 10 million ton

sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment

of

this goal would

adversely affect the economic

development of Cuba.

It was our hope that some-

time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would

volunteer to discuss his country's economic

situation

which might have opened the conversation
