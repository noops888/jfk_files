eaanating from underneath her kitchen door. Upon examining the
situation, she overheard loud conversing in the connecting room.
Tn listening further, Mrs. VALENTINER was able to record the
conversation in Room 209 by taking copious notes. Mra. VALENTINER
believed there were three Cubans present together with two other
individuals whose nationality she could not determine but whose
panes the established to be Frank RENDER and "Jinmie." One of

Agent DAVIS dndicated. that he interviewed Mrs.
VALENTINER in her quarters in the notel during the houra 2300 to
O14S on ID ani 20 July 1960. The weiter, at this point, inquired
as to the size of the crack underneath Mra. VALENTINER's kitchen
door. DAVIS anavered by stating that 1t was large (exact dimen-
sions not noted). He further de¢lared that she had mentioned to
him that she was able to cbserve the portion of the leg (to the
knee) of many of the individuals participating in the discussion.
The writer further queried DAVIS as to vhether she had any know-
ledge of Spaniah. DAVIS replied that she advised him that she
possesses fluent Imowledge of Spanish after having resided in Cuba
for ten years. Her husband has lived in Cuba for thirty years.
Yinile at the motel, DAVIS observed that she nad notes of the

the FBI from the home of Mrs. MORRIS or MORRISON (not further
identifiea). i :

Mra. VALENTINER, according to DAVIS, did a little investigating
on her ow. After the meeting of the grow was over, Frank BENDER
called National Airlines to confirm his reservations for 19 July
1960. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. VALENTINER called National Airlines
and determined that BENDER was destined for Washington, D.C, She
also. conducted discreet inquiries at the motel and ascertained

that the occupants of Rooy 209 were a group of businessmen using —.. _...

the room for the day. hrs. VALSNTINER was careful to note the

- License plates of two cars that vere used by the conferees;. She

conducted no further investigation.

Special Agent: DAVIS: describea Mra. VALENTINER as discreet,
cooperative, intelligent, .anti-CASTRO, and anti-Commmist. DAVIS
feels that this particular incident will "diesa natural death”
and that the people who have becone Imowledgeable to some extent
of our activity are discreet enough to not discuss it further.

During his discussion with Mra. VALEATINER, DAVIS at no time divulged
any United States Goverment sponsorship of this matter.

Acting Special Agent in Charge Richard BAKER coneluied that
as far as the local FBI Office was concerned, this was a closed

“matter. He added that any other participation by his office would

have to be approved by FBI Headquarters.

At Coral Gebles, Florida

At 1100 hours, 24 July 1960, the Reporting Agent, under alias,
moved inte reon 206 at the University Court Resort Motel. A

physical survey at the motel was made on this day. Attention is
invited to Exhibit #6. Building "C" where the meetings ware con-
ducted have conpletely equipped connecting dinette kitchens. Mrs.
Clark VALENTINER currently occupies rooa 210 at this motel where,

hed she elected to do so,would be able to overhear the entire -
conversation in room 209 from her kitchenette. As will be noted

on the page 7 diegram of Exhibit $6, her kitchen extends three to
four feet (actual measurement) into roca 209. ‘the kitchen door

is of plywoed construction. In building C there is a 3/% to 1 inch
gap between the floor and the base of the Xitchen doors to apparently
allow for vall to wall carpeting. Petween roms 203 and 209 there

that 13 is impossible to monitor conversation taking place in 209
fron 208 without the use of proper listening devices, According

to tir. BROWN, previously identified in thia report, the windows

It would be difficult for anyone to monitor the conversation

completed a memorandum for the recomi, requested by Mr. LAHGAN,

Ur. DROLLZR indicated that the gist of his cover story for
the indigenous personnel 1a that he is a private American citizen
and a member of a group-of American citizens (business, education,
eto.) who _souetines in the past find themselves in minor disezree-'
ment vith the United States foreign policy in Latin America (fevror-
ing TRUJILLO and the like). ‘That this group has noticed a much
more “forward look" by the United Statez Goverment and that the
group is therefore directed to do anything which can be of
assistance to patriotice citizens who will bring about a change
of the CASTRO Government. DROLLER further declared that cperating
with this cover story, he bas never mentioned that he was en
employee of the United States Goverment. Mr. LANGAN, at this
point, queried Mr, DROLLER whether any mention of the United
States Government had been made by the indigencus personnel who
participated in the meetings. DROLIER could not recall. Hs
further pointed out that United States Governzent come up in
meetings when diacussing United States foreim policy, but never
in comnection with employment by the United States Government.
