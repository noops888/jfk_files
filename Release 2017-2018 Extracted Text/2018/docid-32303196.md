It is noted that currently SAMUEL MANNARINO is in Chicago

It Is recalled that in August, 1961, JOSEPH MEROLA, former

CI of the Miami Office, was interviewed in Miami by

SAS JOHN S. PORTELLA and THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III of the

Pittsburgh Division. At that time MEROLA advised that

MANNARINO was a cocaine "sniffer" on a regular basis.

On 2/14/62, Departmental Attorney JOHN MULLANEY advised

SAC B. C. BROWN that he felt that the possibility that

MANNARINO could be proven to be a user of narcotics was

worth exploring.

attempt to ascertain whether or not MANNARINO uses

narcotics during his irregular visits to the Pines Motel,

Route 56, Leechburg, Pa., and he said he believed the

Chicago Office should try to make the same determination

as regards MANNARINO's stay in the hotel in Chicago.

Arrangements have been made for SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III I

to take an agent of the Federal Narcotics Bureau from

Pittsburgh to examine the room used at the Pines Motel,

Leechburg, Pa.,

if MANNARINO does, in fact, use it on

the evening of

2/17/62.
