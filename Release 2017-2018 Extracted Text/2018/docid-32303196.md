It is recalled that in August, 1961, JOSEPH MEROLA, former
CI of the Miami Office, was interviewed in Miami by

SAs JOHN S. PORTELLA and THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III of the
Pittsburgh Division. At that time MEROLA. advised that
MANNARINO was a cocaine "sniffer" on a regular basis.

on 2/14/62, Departmental Attorney JOHN MULLANEY advised
SAC B. C. BROWN that he felt that the possibility that
MANNARINO could be proven to be a user of narcotics was
worth exploring. He suggested that Pittsburgh Division
attempt to ascertain whether or not MANNARINO uses
narcotics during his irregular visits to the Pines Motel
Route 56, Leechburg, Pa., and he said he believed the j
Chicago Office should try to make the same determination;
as regards MANNARINO's stay in the hotel in Chicago. t

to take’ an agent of the Federal Narcotics Bureau from
Pittsburgh to examine the room used at the Pines Motel,

e evening of 2/17/62.
