prove into Ray's political thinking, ‘and, by reiterating previously oade
statements on the Bender group's willingness to. soppart tha MRP, to
establivh the Bender group as & private contacto efinitive for anti-
Castro activities. In line with this, I kept the meeting purposely

eo en “exctanze of views" seeaton, avoiding any controversy, but ot

tho came tine, indicating some surprise and some bewilderment over some

of RB statements.

&, Throughout the conversation, Ray elearly streosed his great
belief ta efvil Liberties, tnJividual freedoa, am) bie pooiticn a6 6
Cuban, and also Lemiapsaric, nationalist. On e number of occasions, he

bave to die in failure — 0 be it! It ves at this point when Ray complaines
bitterly adous cur honsling of the Stnesto walsh offeir: Sinesto Kalsh wo
iwoking for arms. He, Rey, vas eager to bulld up bis orsanization and
therefore to ¢rav peuple like Valsz into bis circle.. One of the means to

do this was, of course, to cake tals vepenent on Eis, lays, ability to
furnieh military equtpment. “walrn made a request for.ares to Rays Roy
channeled this request to his Acerican contacts in Havana in the anticipation
thot he, fay, would be given the crecit by Valeb of having selivered the goods.
Vbst happenes, Sovever, vas that Plinto Prieto, ubo ha: deen trained in
Anarica, wate contact vith Nalsh an: aacured him that supg-st vould be
fortheoming from s source other than sy. This, Riy continosy, vas in
dieation thet the Americans wytes to eplit svoy the Waleb group frow

Ray's influence. I indicated no trovledge about this affair but poo-poced

the conclusion drawn fram it by Ray.

8, After this political Jtscussion, Ray elucicated on psychological

aspects of the KR? vork! vo rre revolutionaries, ont thus ve must retain,
at sll tines, @ lean ami bunsry loos. kach one of us, regarclese of tbe
level of our activities, sust bava a feeling of personal respoasibilitys
from me down ta the plain cook, wa enot have specific tasks assigned to us
to do and each of us must recognize that we vill be heli responsible for
the success or fatlore of the specific mission essignes to va. Thus, for
instance, we ean not be satisfied Just to accept moneys vu mast exgage ip
fund-ratoing Jrives here ari! in Cuba. These srivee night not bring in
woh end hopefully, Renter vill eake up the difference, but the individual
fund-raisers Will Dave a feeling of accomplishment and vill not set fat and

opulent snd lagy,

9. Above concluded tha over-all dtacusoion and som: detailed questions
wero asked by Ray, Could be bave $25,000 by next week? (I comitted
$10,000.) Could he engage in a funtersising activity in the U. 5.7 (2
temporized,) Could be have prees conferences? (I saic, why not?) Could
be beve radio tinct (I said, gerkaps.) Could he est eilitary sist (z
eaid yee, provided our eriteria for furnishing uch ais wouls be vet, and
I repeated, at that point, ay view that there could be uo duplication of
effort.) Rey told se that the chief af the KA? in Cuba vas 9 chap dy the
nase of (tnu) Cisneros. He told me s hanuel Gadseo, woo is currently in
Spain, vould play a coneiderable role in the }A? peych warfare activities.

10, The weeting closed with cur uJerstanding that ve would meet asain
withio thc next two weeks.
