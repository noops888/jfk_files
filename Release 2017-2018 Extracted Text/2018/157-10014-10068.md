to be something incomplate with that answar of mine, however.

there is no question in reading the documents that I road this

morning, which I had not seen in the batter part of fifteen

years, that a man did go out from Headquartars and was provide

with material which you mentioned and had a discussion along

these lines with the Chlot of station.

lie did not, howevar, go out with instructione to the Chief

of Station without furthar rafarance to Headquartara to set

about assassinating Lumumba.

Mr. Baron. In your answors that we have just reviewed in

your first examination, you indicated that you had no knowlerus

of a mission by Dr. Gottliab to the Congo and that there was

nothins in your experience in the Agency that would really bear

on the question whather such a mission was undertaken or what

the character of it was.

Has the review of the documents torlay refreshed your

recollection to some substantial degree?

that DI. Gottliab went to the Congo.

I was merely telling you, at that time, what I could

remembar, and there was an awful lot that l ald not and do not.

Mr. Baron. To move to the parlod when you ware Chief of

tho Africa Division and Richard Bissell was DDP in the summer

6

of 1960, did you have conversations with Richard Biasell where

*7

the subjact of the assassination of lumumba aross?

8

MI. Tweedy, Yas, I did. In fact, the first conversation.

9

na I recall it, that I ever had on the subject. was one he

1.:

initiated with me, and, as I think I told you, i do not recall

oxactly what was aald, but there was no question about it but

what Mr. Bissall was saying to me was that thare was agreement.

i"¡ policy agreament in Washington, that Lumumba must be removed

from the position of control and influance in the congo or that

¿¿ l the Corgo was going to be in serious trouble and thus Africa,

at that stage of its development; and that among the possibil

i:: ities of that elimination was indeed assassination.

In turms of the dotail of that conversation with Mr. Hissell.

This cartalnly was

Mr. Baros. Was Mr. Binsell any mora specific at any poi:.t

Ms. Dallas, which implind to me there was pollay agreement in

Washington. When I say polley agreement in Washington, I cannot

ba more specific because I navar knew any more specificity. '

however, 'it was perfectly clear that the Agancy felt that it

had some aort of policy consensus in Hashington about the need

for the removal of Lumumba. When I aay removal, I mean by

whataver means; this does not necessailly have to be confined

to assassination, a political way of doing it, or anythin

alas.

10

Mr. Baron. It did not exclude

assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. No, indeed it did not.

MI, Baron. You are referring to the cable of luaust lath

from Allan Dullas to the Chief of Station in tho Condo. llar

Mr. Baron. In your talke with Mr. Dissell, where the

subjact of the assassination of Lumumba was raisod in any

from this general laformition

6

to you that the subject had been opened at very high lavels

to asking you to procoad to axplore means to getting access to

6

Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him?

Mr, Tweedy. The purpose of his conversation with me was

to Initlate correspondence with the station for them to explore

:: with Headquarters the possibility

of this, that la assassina

tion, or irdead

any other means of ramoving Lumumba trom power.

:: In other words, the purpose of thei

exercise was to tall the

of it, and than to have the station

start roviowing possibilitias, assets, and discussing them with

i: Headquarters ir detail in the same way that we would with any

:overation, whether it was as sensitive as this, or loss so.

It was, in other words, the initiation of quite normal

from the fact that it was

an unusual subiact.

Mr. Baron. At some noint after the serias of conversations

means of assasainating Lumumba?

Would that be correct?

8

Mr. Tweedy, I would put it more broadly than that. I

would say that he was to continue to explore it to determine

whather or not there was a feasible means.
