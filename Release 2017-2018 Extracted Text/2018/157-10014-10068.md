we have gone over your testimony on tha Lumumba case in som:

deteil in two sessions, one today when you raviewed some slocu

ments that we obtained since your first examination. And 1

‘would Like to bein by reading a quotation from your first

examination before you had saen these documents.

TOP SECRET



At page 30 of the: transcript of your examination on
September 9th, I would Like to ask you whather today's review of |
documents has changed your answer to this question. At that’ :
tima I asked you: “Do you have any knowledge of a messenger
from CIA Headquarters having vo go to the Congo to provide the
chief of station in the Congo with instructions to carry out
the assassination of Lumumba if possible, ‘and also provide him
with the tools to carry out such an assagsination, namely
poisons and medical equipment for administering them?"

You said, "No, I do not.” . ;

Later on in your testimony of that. sama session when you

were asked your opinion as to the truth of testimony we had

ived from Dr. Gottlieb excuse me, from tha Chief of
oe

' Station, who was in Leopoldville at that time, about a visit

i that he received from pr. Gottliab,; where the Chief of Statior

' testified that he received poison and instructions from(pr.

Gottlieb, whan asked your cpinion about ths truth about the

testimony of the Chief of Station, you responded that “Thare
is nothing in my experience with the Agency that would reatly
bear on that point whatsoever." And thet was at
your transcripts

llave your answers to those two questions changed in lient
of your review of the documents today?

wr. Tweedy, { heve not hal a chance to read tha transer

of my first testimony. As you know, I started reading it this

morning but did not gat a chance 9 get through te. There
to be something incomplete with that answer of mine, howev
there is no question in Treading the documents that I read‘ this
morning, which I had not seen in the batter part of fifteen
years, that a min did go out from Headquarters and was provided
with material which you mentioned and had a discussion along
these lines with the Chief of Station.

Ha Aid not, how + go out with instructions to the Chief
of Station without further referance to Headquarters to set
about assassinating Lumumba,

Mr. Raron. In your answers that we have just reviewed in

| your first examination, you indicated that you had no knowledirs

of « mission by'pr. Gottifab to the Congo and that there was

-_

; nOthing in your experlence in the Agency that would really bear

on the question whether such a mission was undertaken or what

the character of it was.

Nas the review of the documents today refreshed your

recollection to some substantial degree?

Mr. Tweedy. What T wes certainly trying to say the first
iy

time, and T repeat it, I said T hat no recollaction oF tir

that Dr. Gottlieb want to the Congo,

‘ Was merely telling you, at that time, what I vould
remember, and there was an awful lot that [ did not and do not.

Mr. Baron. To move to the perio? when you were Chief of
the Africa Division and Richard Bissel! was ppp in the sumrar
of 1960, aid you have conversations with Richard Bissell where
the subject of the assassination of Lumumba arose?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I did. In fact, the first conversation
as I recall it, that I ever had on the subject.was one he
initiated with me, and, an f think lI told you, 1 do net recall
exactly what was said, but thare waa no question about {t but.

; what Mr. Bissell was saying to ma was that thare was aqreemant.
policy agreement in Washington, that. Lumumba most be removed

from the position of control and influence in the Congo or that

| the Congo was going to be in serious trouble and thus Africa,

{ at that stage of its development; and that. among the possibil~
i
ities of that elimination was indeed assassination.

In terms of the detail of that conversation with Mr. Nieseell.
i really cannot go any further than that. This certainly was
the aist of it.

Mr. Baron, Was Mr. Binsell any mora specific at any point
with you about the policy level whare the consideration to
assassinate Lumumba had been male?

Mr. Tweedy. No, sir. Tha most authoritative statement on

that was a cable that went out to tha field from thea Mtrector,

TOP SECRET



Mr. Dilles, which implied to me there was policy agreement in

Washington. When I aay policy agreement in Washington, I cannot

ba mora spacific because I naver knew any more specificity.

Mowever, it" waa perfectly clear that the Agancy felt that it
had some sort of policy consensus in Washington about the need
for the removal of Lumumba. When I say removal, I mean by
whatever means: this does not necesearily have to be confin
to assassination, a political way of doing it, or anything

| elec.

Mr. Baron. It did not excluds assasmination?

Mr. Tweedy. No, indeed it did not.

Mr. Baron. You are referring to the cable of Auqust 24rh
from Alisn fullas to the Chief of Station in the Congo. fled
you seen that cable shortly after it was sent?

Mr. Tweedy. I suspect, aqain I cannot be sure, I suspect
that I saw it when it went out. At this point, Tt could not
even tell you. On instructions, I might even have drafted it,
this seems odd. I might have done, or had a hand in drafting
it, I do not know. it was basically Mr. Dulles’ cable exore
sing to the Station the typs of authority that he had to pess
such a massage to the fiald, { cartainiv would have seen it
on its way out.

Mr. Raror.. When you spoke to Mr. Nissall, either in the
first talk or in any subsequent talks -~

The Chairman. Where ia this cable?

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. Tab 2 in the Senator's pack:
The Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Raron, In your talks with Mr. Aissell, where the
subject of the assassination of Lumumba was raised in any
i fashion, did Mr. Biesell move from thie general information
ij te you that the subject had been opened at very high levels
q to asking you to procaad to explors meana to getting access to

Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him?

Mx. Tweedy. The purpose of hie conversation with me was

{ to ini¢date correspondence with tha Station for tham to explore
with Headquarters the possibility of this, that is ssaassina-
tion, or indead any other means of] removing Lumumba tram power.
In other words, the purpose of thel exercise was to tell the
Station what Hwadquarters had in mind, giving it some {daa of
the policy background of it, and then to have the Station
start reviewing possibilitias, assets, and discussing them with
Headquarters in detail in the same way ‘hat we would with any
operation, whether it was as sensitive as this, or lass so.

It was, in other words, the initiation of quite normal
operetional dialogue between Headquarters and the field, apart
from the fact that it was an unusual subject.

Mr. Baron. At some point after the serias of conversatious

with Richard Bissell, di@ you have a conversation with Sidney

Nottlich ‘about a mission that he was to undertake in tha

Congo? / -

TOP SECRET

f
'

Mr. Tweedy. |I was certainly reminded of that tn this
correspondence, as I think I told you in the first instance.

- a .
If Gottlieb went to the Congo, there {# no- question that 1 would

| have seen him befora he want, This traffic makes it perfactly

clear that I did. The actual content of that conversation is
no more clear to ma now as is revealed in this cable traffic.
On the cthar hand, I do think that is the qist of it.

Mr. Baron. You are referring to the cable that appears in

Tab 3, a cable of September 19th that you signed and Richard

| Bissell signed and dispatched to the Chief of Station in

Leopoidville telling him that/Sid from Paris, a man who would

announce himself as Sid ‘from Paris, would be coming acon to

Leopoidville to explain an assignment to tha Chief of Station.

Mr. Tweady. ‘That. is correct.

The Chairman. Sid from Paris being Dr. Gottlieb?
StS .

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, sir.

Mr. Baron. . As we discussed earlier today, you do have

“ g recollection of setting up a specially restricted channel of

++ communication by this cable which would hold all communications

Ou this operation. to the wyss Only of the Chief of Station,
is that correct?

1
Hr, Tweedy. ,Yes. This was done immediately after my

first discussion with Mr. Rissell.

Mr. Aaron. No you remember any instauce where “r. Risse!)

‘asked you to speak} to Dr. Gottlieb ast qive him this asaiqument?

TOP SECRET



Me. Tweedy. No, I do not. My assumption would be that
he would have had the first conversation with Dr. Gottlieb and
quite routinely hava said, now you talk to Mr, Twaedy, Chief of
the Division, before you go aut.

Mr. Baron. Would you assume in thds normal course of
operations in the DDP at that point you would have spoken to

Biesell before you spoke toj Fottliah Jabout this mission?

Mr. Tweedy. Inevitably, I think, IT think}Gottifeblwas in

wae —

1 think (or. Gottlieb was, at that time, an ageistant to Mr.

Mr. Baron, As best you can recall, what instructions (id
‘you aive to‘or. Gottlish lwien ‘you met with him?

Mr. Tweedy. his ta very general, but I think 4¢ covers
‘le: to assist the Chief of Station in his operational plannina

for this particular purpose.

Mr. Baron. Would that plannina have included plannina for

the assassination of Lumumba?

Mx. Tweedy. Specificallv, I do not think bre Toentien |
would have been thare to discuss Constitutional means of over-
throw of Lumumba. ile was thers for one purpose only. Ile was
a technician. He had this material with him, fly was thus
to act, as T think, a technical advisor on thane matters to

the Chief of Station. 1 do not think he was to be there as 4

general operational afvisor. That was not within his competencs,

TOP SECRET



hie training, or anything else. Et would not have been his
assigunant. !
Mr. Baron, What did you tell’ Dr. Gottlieb about the source

| of authority for this mission?

Mr. Tweedy. I am not sure I toid him anything. I assumed

that came through Mr. Bissell.

Mr.Baron, I will represent to you, as 1 did earlier today,

that Or. Gottlieb testified that in his conversation with you
rms -

y you indicated to him that you ware giving him this miasion on

i
1 the authority of Richard Bissell.

Would that be consistent with the way you operated at that
time?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes. Tha only thing that is wrong there is
the use of the varb -~ [I was not sanding him to the Congo. tie

i;

i routinely checked, probably on Mr. Sissell's instructions, with
me, Chief of the Africa Division. He had already been given
nis marching orders to go to the Congo by Mr. Rissall, not by
me.

—.%
Mr. Baron. You would assume that, fohtlieh had a

separate conversation with Richard Aissell, whare Richard Misse??
told him, it is time for you to qo to the Congo and deliver
lethal material and 4 certain set of instructions to the Chie!

of Station.

Mr, Tweedy. - cannot assuma what was said in such a

couversation, but that (Pr. Gottlieb talked to Mr. Bissell befor:

he want to the Congo is without question. I do not know what
[was said. I assume the general outlines of the purposes of

| him going to the Congo were discussed, and I would be discussing

! them with him in greater detail.

Mr. Baron. Turning to Tab 6 of the Senator's book

referring to a cable we reviewed this morning issued on
ptember 27th by tha Chief of Station and sent to you, Eyes .

Only, at the CIA Headquarters where the Chief of Statioa indi-

cates that he contacted Gottlieb on the 26th of September and

they were on the same wavelength.
Mr. Tweedy. Which one is this?
Mr. Baron. This should be marked number 6.

Mr. Twoady. Oh, yes, axcuse ma,

Mr. Baron. [t bagins, "Iden Ref contacted 26 September.”
"tn this cable, the Chief of Station indicates that he had had
" two talks withiDr. Gott! ie. He and pr. Gottlieb. had bean
considering a list of possibilities as follows.
In paragraph slat the bottom of the next paga, the Chief
of Station says, “Plan proceed on basis priority as listed
abeve unless instructed to contrary.”
And paragraph A on tha first page was Chief of Station
top priority plan which related to recalling a cartain agent
from Stanlayville and having him taka rafuqe with Mig Prothar.

The Coble coutinues,* "would thus act as inside man to brush up

understanding, Mr. Tweedy, that Big Brother refers te Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I do.

Mr, Baron. That this was a report from the Chief of
Station to yourself informing you that the top priority plan would
be to recall an agent from Stanlayville and ask that agent to |
infiltrate the entourage of Lumumba where ha could assess the

possibility for poisoning Lumumba, would that be your under-

| standing?

Mr. Tweedy. Fventually, when & number of other steps had

taken placa before and they would, for example, have included

a discussion between the Chiaf of Station and this aqent which
: would have made clear to tha aqent what this was all about.

At this stage, he had no idea of it, and our series of

exploratory cables between Leopoldville and Headquarters

outlining the degrse -f"— "ie his cane a Ip

access to the entourage, What he-found out and whether any of
this basically bore on the feasibility of tha operation.

‘My. Baron, This was one of a sarias of cables where the
Chiaf of Station was reporting on his attampt of finding means
of accass to Lumumba for the purpose of noisoning him?

Mr. Tweedy. Throncthout. this whole period, the activity of
the Chief of Station in correspondance with "eadquartars was
exploratory.

“Mr. Raro., What wag bain axplorad was the means of access

| natives. That does not appear in thie particular cables it
{appears in cthere.

| Mr. Baron. Turning now to Tab 9 of the Senator's books
| thia is the cable of October 7 which you received in the Fyes

si
| Only channel from the Chief of Station which indicated that

Gottlieb had departed from Leopoldville for America on the

Sth of October, and it says: “View expiration d. nis
materials. However left certain items of continuing. usefulness
= Guthman” -- which-is a pseudonym for the Chief of Station whom

- we have been calling Hedgeman -- "Guthman plans continued
try implement op.”

poss that indicate that you received a report from the
Chief of Station that he would continue to try to implement
this operation against Lumumba even aftar ‘Gottiieb haa left
the Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. He would continue to explore the posaibilitics
of this operation and continue to report to Headquarters. That
is all that this means.

Tt dows not mean with the disappearance of Gottlieb ha

would try to pull off the oparation without further reference

to Headquarters. Tt just means a continuation despite the

until the point where he had determined there w

10 | whether or not there was a feasible meana. tie perfectly well

could coma to the conclusion that with the hardest work in the

i world that he could sew no way to do it: That would have beer
a perfectly acceptable conclusion to Neadquarters, because a

decision would have to be made professionally.

In the second paragraph, you told the Chief of station:
"Raise above so you ara not confused by any apparent duplication

priority.”

Was the colleaque that you ware refarring tolor. Gottl ish?

Mr. Tweedy. Without doubt.

Mr. Baron. What did you mean by disposition spontaneous]?

ME. Tweedy. The fagiish of that cable, ag I mentioned
this morning, is absolutaly appalling.

What I am actually saying is, wherever vou talk to people

like wa did with the French, as I mentioned in the asxt sentence:

ji or anyone is studying the situation in Africa, thay all came

up with tha same conclusion, that there was to he no solution

' to the Condo with Lumumba still in power,or in a position of

overcoming it.

“Mr. Baron, To summarize what we discussed this morning,

despite the serias of cables and the indication here that

Lumumba's disposition spontaneously was the number one consi:
ation and highest priority. You are still maintaining that

the Chief of Station, was not. amnowared to co through with

assassination without checking back with Naadouarters?

Mr. Baron. I have no further questions at this point.
(Whereupon, Senator Church left the hearing room.)
Senator Goldwater. Mr. Tweedy, how long did you sarve
with the CIA?
Mr. Tweedy. I started with CIG on the lst of May, 1947 and
rved until March, 1973.
Senator Goldwater. You have had experience with intelli-

gence gathering agencies all around the world, I assume, or

|.moat of them?

Mr. Tweedy. A considerable number, yes, afr.
Senator Goldwater. Is it common practice in intelligence
encies such as the CIA for a lot of people to know about
everything that is going on, or am I riaht in assuming that
there are many things that you do in the intelligence field,

particularly the covert field, that the man sitting next to you

may know nothing about. Is that corract?

Mr. Tweedy. That is correct, gir. Compartmentation ‘was
very heavy in CIA. Thera were a qruat many thinds going on that
1 never knew anything about and do not know to this day.

Senator Goldwater. Is that not in vour experiance the

most successful form of intullisence aathering? Ts that the

since before its, conception, I want to ask you, end of your
experiance, what you think as 4 professional of the men in the
v

CIA, men and women?

Mx. Tweedy. I came away from a career in intelligence in

i March of '73 with rather strong convictions. 1 might preface

my remarks here in anawer to your question, Senator, by saying

| I was in intelligence during the War, I was in Naval Intelli-

gence. This was not OSS, but I was in intallinence. ft also
daterminad me, if the circumstances permittad, to make a
career of intelligence after the War, and after the difficulty
of making the right contacts and so on ard so forth, eventual!-
it worked and 1 snent a career in CTA.

I have two very strong impressions of that expariance.

One of them has to do with my colleagues, the personnel of the

Agency, who I found to be a remarkably telented aroup, The

* second was, and it was something that I think all of us were

‘ basically proud of, the esprit de corps was at a very high

level and resulting from esprit da corps, es it usually doas.
discipline was equally of a very high level, and it came quits
naturelly, this was aot a matter that hed to be Inculcated ent
bsaten inte junior officers, it came quits naturally because
this was quite cluarly the wav the orqanization was run, and
basically, we were proud of it,

proud of it and my associations.

Senator Goldwater. Are you still close to the members of
the CIA, your old friends?

Mr. Tweedy. Obviously I havea a great many friends who are
still serving. This is increasingly not the case as retirements
are catching up with my colleagues, but I do keep abreast of
Agency affaira to the extent I can. I do not attempt to inter-
fere with them, At their request, I did a consultation job in
the Agency this summer. It's the first time I was asked to do
it. I was vary glad to do it. I found 1¢ interesting,

stimulating, I was glad to be back. I do not necessarily

expect to do it again. However, if they askad me, I would If

I thought I could be of any help.
Senator Goldwater. Have you ever known of any actions
or activities to be taken in a precipitous manner in the CIA?
Mr. Tweedy. That is a very broad question, Senator. I am
not quite sure how to answer it.

As in every organization, I have certainly seen decisions

“taken and actions implemented that miqht hava been better

considered. This includes me, and there are a number of things

“thet professionally I would have done different if { had been

undertaking -as an assassination, ragardless of who the taraet

{might be, would be a subject that would be dreamed up in the

locker room at soma lower level. Those decisions and other

What is your concept of the term higher or highest author-

T merely felt that the concensus at the policy levels of

Senator Muddleston. Do you recall being told specifically
that this operation had the approval, or was, in fact, the
policy of the highest authority?

Mr. Twaedy. No, air, I do not recall that. Highest

authority was normally used in cable traffic, so we did not havea

Senator Huddleston. Is £t common within the Agency, that.

Chief?

Mr. Tweedy. Not the Station Chief unless you actually ask
the Station Chief to come back.

Senator Huddleston. A cable would have to be used?

Mr. Tweedy. Or send a messenger personally out.

Normally on somathing like this, a8 it happened in this
case, Mr. Nissell talked to Mr. Dulles and Mr. Nissall talked
to me aud ha did not sit dow, and write a memorandum to me,
Tam virtually a hundred percent sure.

Senator Huddleston. Ts it your beliaf that participants

in thase kinds of discussions had very explicit understandings

i about what each was talking about? No possibility, virtually

“no possibility that there would be @ misunderstanding as to

what the iustructions ware and what the limits were?
‘ar. Tweedy. Really thy only peopla that were sariousiv
dnvolvad with this were in the field, the Chief of Station;
if you are talking about operational detail, myself and mv
‘deputy, with 4r. Bissell included, to the extent that he neaded
to yet into the overstional detail.
On that score, I would sav nO misunderstanding whatsoever.

Me. Tweedy, I always assumed so, sir. Obviously, again, |

Sanator Huddleston. Given their experience and their

knowledge of each othar and the knowledge of the operation --

Mr. Tweedy. Thay ware very closa personally, Mr. Bissell

sionally. |

Senator Huddleston. Even the communication batwaen the

a member of the Council, it was not likely that thare would be
& great deal of misunderstanding thers between what you really
are talking about, although there is no written ordar?

Senator Schweike Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Twasdy, in the Auqust cable that Allen Nulles sent *o

Station, he started out with the words “fn hiah

here”?
Mi. ‘Tweedy. The policy level. As I say, 1 cannot nacessa

gay it included a spacific conversation with the Prasident. 1+

certainly, in my view, would have invoived the National Securit.

I mention the Secretary of State, because later on in the cabla,

perfectly contant to have this discussed with the state Depart-
Ment in the field, i , the Embassy, if this should prove to
be necessary.

Senator Schweiker. Mr, Riesell testified before this
Committees that "dn high quartera here” masnt the Prasidant to
him, I assume that you ara not as convinced of that as Mr.

Bissell?

Mr. Tweedy. F do not think it a question of conviction.
was closer to the policy level than [| was; ha would hava a bett<
feel for this than I would. We never explained to me what the

spacific policy lavel decision was. i! was the one Executive

Director who would talk directly with the Director. Conceiv-

ably -- I do not say he did not, and T do not say he did. ‘He
i may even have talked to the senior mambars of tha cevernment:
1 did not,

Senator Schweiker. We also testified that the further
part of the paraaraph, consequently we conclude that his rene
that removal meant assassination.

Does that or does that not concur with vou?

Mr. Tweedy. It does not concur; it would refer to assas-
sination but not exclusively.

Senator Schweiker. It goes on to say “Wn further author:

axpanditures of up to $100,000 to carry out any programa dn
which you do not have the opportunity to consult. Plea:

advise.”

ows that not mean to you, here is $100,000, do with it as |
!

you want, you do not have to consult if you do not have the
opportunity?
Hr. Tweedy. This ia cartainly the way i¢ would read, 1

read it, and I think Tt read it at the time, when you are talking

about that kind of money and crash programs, what you are talkine

basically are political action type programs, not assassination
type programs.
Senator Schweiker. Of coursa--

Mr. Tweedy. ‘Tho beginning of that paragraph says, “Merce

we wish to give you wider authority,” at cetera, et ceterc,
Tincluding more aggressive action, if it can remain covert.”

Sunator Schweikar. What does the term mean, "More
aggressive action? How aagressiva can you gat, even more
aggressiva, “including even more accressive action, 1€ it can
remain covert" moaning if you can get away with it.

Mr. Tweedy, Correct.

My own beliaf is, because quite frankly T cannot rece]!
what this had specific reference to -- my belief is that ths:
hed reference to general political action along the lines 0°
mounting suceussful political operations against Lumumba. wh

is the sort of thing that. would cost 4 lot of money.

TOP SECRET



Of course, we know now that at the time, *
or very shortly about the same time we were sending poison down
| there, certainly it was not political action. In light of what
"wa know now, would it not mwan fairly clearly that this was an
authorization for an assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. No, sir, I do not believe so, for tha simple

| reason that although we sent, pr. cottlieij and his mater

down to the Conqo, the chief of Station waa always exploring.

ag many of thaas cables indicata, other means of qatting rid of
Lumumba besides assassination. It was always, certainly in my

mind, and I think in Mr, Bissell's mind, a clear realization --

and certainly the Chief of Station's mind -- shat whan evary

thing had been axamined, 4 suecagsful way of doing assassination

was not necessarily to be axpacted. Maybe it would, but it

was not necessarily to be expucted.

Thus, it was incumbent upon the Chief of Station to keap

his eye on the whole spectrum of possibilities of aatting rid

of Lumumba, politically or any othar wav.

Senator Schweiker. We know two thinas now in light of
this. One is he asked an vecant to kill Lumumba, one agent
declined. We asked another avent to no down and do that, :
he assented. Since he specifically mantionad the two saparete:
agents, One inwhich tha aqent testified. sitting where you era,

what you know about the business, would he have conducted
himself any differently than what you now see as this case?
Mr. Tweedy. Not the slightest. He would consider himself

in a disciplined organization, a servant of his chain of command

as a member of the organigation and not receiving some direct

word from the President which, in effect, would have made him
feal to go out and do anything he pleased,

Mr. Kirbow, Ia it not the paramount situation, the non-

and I know Mr. Bissell would have talked to Mr. Dulles. Where

than speculate. I do not think that would be very helpful.

Mr. Tweedy. T think that. would be fair to say, but that
would depend so much on tha understanding between Mr. Dulles
and the policy levels of qovarnment to which I was not privy,

1 really cannot comment substantively on that.

Mr. Tweedy. The only one to which I was x exposed of

Mr. Schwarz. What was so special about Lumumba that
justified killing him?

Mr. Twaedy. There was nothing Special about Lumumba as

a Person.

Mr. Schwarz. In that sense, you would distinguish him

4
! from Hitler, whom you did Say was special as a parson?

Mr. Tweedy. No, let ma try to answer your question, which

has to be answered more fully than just discussing Lumumba.

Tha concern with Lumumba waa not Feally the concern with

Lumumba as a parson. [t was concerned at this very preqnant

‘+ | point in the new African development of the effect on tha

“ balance of the Continent of a disintegration of the Congo, ant!

it was the general feeling that Lumumba had it within his

Power to bring about this dissolution, and this was the faar

“ that it would merely ba the start -- the Congo, after all, was

the largest geographical expression.” Contained in it were
enormously important mineral resources. Africa ag & whole,
the Congo itself, is adjacent to Nigeria, which at that point
was considered to be one of thea mein hopes of the futures
stability of Africa, and if the Conao had fallan, then the
chences were Nigeria would be seized with the sama infection.
This was why Washincton, after the point the Western
world was 80 concerned about Lumumba, not because there was

something unique about. Lumumba, but it was the Conqo.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever consider in your discussion of

TOP SECRET



thie subject what effect i¢ would have on the United States!
position in Africa if it were to be known. the policy makers
in Africa sat around thinking about killing Patrice Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. Policy makers in America?

Mr. Schwarz.

Mr. Tweedy. Indeed we did, which waa one of the reasons,
jj one of the eine qua none of thia operation was that the American.
hand would be totally hidden, which was, amongst:others, a
