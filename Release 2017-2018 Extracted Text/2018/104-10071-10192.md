3. Belo's letter acknowledged receipt of a cable from
Madrigal; tt thon wont on to state that “Rogelio obtained
tho viea" and now "the Haitian can come when he wishes."
(?ield Comment; Bogolio aay be Rogelio Pinto. (s83-4099 2.2
quoted Helo ag siying that Starke bad obtained a visa for
Jacques Moringlane, a Haitian who would bo the first of
tho Masferrer group to arrive in Costa Rica.) Helo then wrote
that because nothing had boon heard from Eedrigal since the
latter's visit to Costa Bica “the frieads here” bad bogua to
believe that “overything hao been a pipe dream of mine; that
yo neither are going to do anything nor havo anything.” Belo
complained that Madrigal's cilonce appaared to have “lossoncd
the cathusiag: of this man of action and of rapid regolutions,
who doos not like to be made to waste his ting.” Holo warned
Madrigal that if the Rasferrer group had not reachsd a deci-
gion to move abead with tho plan, it would bo better for tho
Esitian not to come to Costa Rica. Helo aleo warned that if
there vore no Cubano participating in Masforrer's project, he,
Helo, would not cupport it, since he cas interested only in
the Cubana’ problems and not thosa of tho Haitians. Helo in-
formed Madrigal that he expected to arrive in Hew York on 18
Pobruary;.he suggested that they discuss the subject in detail
at that tine.

4. On 4 March Helo again left Gan Joss for Miami. He
told the Costa Bican security officials that he would be auay
froa Costa Bica for a month. i
