SUBJECT

Political and Guerrilla Training of

Black Militants

A highly sensitive and reliable source has

reported the following:

₴ *

Since early March 1973 the Curiel Apparatus,

a Paris based revolutionary support group for third world

revolutionary novereats, nas been supporting seven

American black militant/hijackers (not further identified)

who were formerly in Algiers.

This group has been given

the code name "BAKER".

the suburbs of Paris under instructions to stay close to

the homes where they are lodged in order to avoid coming

to the attention of the French authorities.

b. At the 2 June 1973 Paris meeting of the

Curiel Apparatus Direction Conmittee, Henri CURIEL,

founder and leader of the Apparatus, stated that seven

and guerrilla technique training in France, which will

last the entire month of August.

According to CURIEL,

this group will return to the United States in September.

"BAKER" group was challenged by a leading Apparatus activist

Apparatus, since there is no objective possibility that

the "BAKERS" will be able to change the structure or

spectacular incidents in the United States with the help

of the training and support given by the Apparatus, they
