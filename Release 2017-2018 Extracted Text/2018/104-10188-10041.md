approach to BSXNAVE, This support included periods of "Iive-monitoring” the
target lines. to give early warning of BSKNAVE's exact departure plans as Well
as the movements of BFKNAVE. LIFEAT also initiated coverase of the Polish
Comercial Office ‘in support of the interested Station officer's attempt to
gain more information on that installation and the personnel asaigned thereto,

(3) LIFEAT/Cuban LIFEAT coverage of two
targets related to the AMSTRUT operation are of great in‘erest to JMWAVE and
Headquarters. Copies of the processed take from these lines are forvarded
weekly to these customers. A recent and excellent roundup of AMSTRUT-S done
by Headquarters drew heavily on LIFEAT provided information. This roundup
was very well done and greatly appreciated by the Station. During the re-
porting period nothing of interest was obtained from the coverage of the

ome of @ Cuban Commercial Attache and it is planned to cut this coverage in
the near future if it remains unproductive.

‘The information proviaed to the local ODENVY office from the coverage of
David URUCKER and Charles SMALL (SMOLIKOFr) 1s most useful to that office
for covering Aucrican leftiate and Conzianists who travol to Mexico. Often
these travellers continue on to Cuba, Their contacts with meabers of ACGN
