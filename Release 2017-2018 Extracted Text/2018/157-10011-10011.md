1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This_refers to
a telephonic. conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and @@aevcsy

I have discussed this matter in detail MN Gascvos aie clearly recollects that his
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief
discussion of the COBRA@iMmEtagoeem teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to @iecgosey
