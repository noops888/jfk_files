OCCURRENCE

(JACK, STEWART,

an officer assigned to the Mexico City station, met in

Mexico City with a high officer in the Cuban armed forces who was subsequently

to become a CIA asset known as A.M. LASH-1.# @SNEWARI met with A.M. LASH to

sound out his views on the Cuban situation. A.M. LASH was in Mexico City to

attend a "leftist-sponsored" conference.

The March 1961 meeting was inconclusive, but it. led to other meetings out

of which Project A.M.LASH was created. A.M. LASH-1 "repeatedly insisted that

the essential first step in overthrowing the regime was the elimination of

CASTRO himself, which /A.M. LASH-1/ claimed he was prepared to accomplish.

repeatedly requested that we /CIAT furnish him the special equipment or material

needed to do the job." (79).

with an effective range of hundreds or thousands of yards," (92) he decided finally

that he knew, as a Doctor of Medicine, that "we could devise some technical means

of doing the job that would not automatically cause him to lose his own life in

Samuel HALPERN and@SANCHE?

requested

assistance from Dr. Edward GUNN of the CIA

Office of Medical Services. (92) On Nov. 20, 1963, they told GUNN that "the

was shot, a CIA officer was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris and giving him an

OCCURRENCE: In a memo of June 24, 1966, Director of Security for the CIA, Howard J.

Osborn set forth the facts involving the Maheu-Rosell affair.

The facts are as follows:

In August, 1960, Richard M. Bissell approached Sheffield Edwards to determine if the

Office of

Security had assets that may assist in a sensitive mission requiring gangster-

type action. The mission target was the liquidation of Fidel Castro. Because of its

extreme sensitivity, only a small group was made privy to the project. The DCI was

briefed and gave his approval.

Col. J. C. King, Chief, WH Division was briefed but all

details were deliberately concealed from any of the JMAVE officials. Certain ISD and

COMMO personnel participated in the initial planning stages, but were not witting of the

purpose of the mission.

Bill Harvey's absence) specifically for information about all CIA action teams inside

Cuba on 30 Oct and again on 31 Oct so that I could give a firm report to Dept. Sect.

Gilpatric prior to negotiations with the Soviets. Chever had not mentioned the

Matahambre sabotage team when I asked about action teams inside. Chever did mention

that twa action teams were inside (one small one in Central cuba, intake tions, but

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale states, "at 16:50 tonight, Lt. Col. Patchel informed me that

Bob Hurwitch of State had just telephoned to report that Radio Havanna reported the

capture of a CIA sabotage team at the Matahambre mines.

Lansdale was in a staff meeting at the time and he asked Patchel to check the truth

of the information with CIA. Patchel informed Lansdale at 1705 that he had talked

to Bill Harvey who reported that sabotage teams (of 4 and 2 men each) had departed

the Us on 17 Oct and gone in on 19 Oct, made an attempt, gone into hiding when the

exfiltration point was cut off; they had remained in hiding until 2 Nov, when they

were picked up.

OCCURRENCE:

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct.

1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to

a telephonic conversation on the evening of

30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheeves y

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheeves and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

discussion of the COBRA and A ORD) teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheere

recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which

OCCURRENCE: President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in

Mexico. It fulfilled U.s. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the

United States and the West.

State believes this should ease the way for future discussions

about Cuba with the Mexicans.

Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by

President Kennedy and President Lopez Mateos included a phrase which was

"They proposed

to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention

may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of-

peoples." In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that "There

were no developments resulting from the President's trip to Mexico including the text

of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter the basic guidelines which govern

the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now had 45 Asians in Havana operating.

In addition there are agents and teams in the provinces.

"Had we been permitted to mount a more intensive and agressive, the original infiltration
