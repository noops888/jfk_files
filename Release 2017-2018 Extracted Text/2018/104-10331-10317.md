Subject: Phone call from Bill McNair, 21 September, 1995, re
AM crypts

Bill left the following message on my voice mail:

“I have just talked witt|| DC/LA Division,
and unless we see a specific incident where giving up an AM
crypt will betray an asset, then let it go . I don't
believe there is any place we will see that. She is will,to
give up-d1l AM crypts simply because there are so many
iterations going back...and things have been changed.”
