THE CUBA PROJECT

. 1. OBJECTIVE

The U.S. objective is to help the Cubans overthrow the Communist -
regime from within Cuba and institute a new governinent with which the
United States can live in peace.

il, CONCEPT OF OPERATION

Basically, the operation is to bring about the revolt of the Cuban
‘people. The revolt will overthrow the Communist regime and institute
a new government with which the United States can live in peace. iss

The revolt requires a strongly motivated political action movement ~~
established within Cubz, to generate the revolt, to give it direction to-
wards the objective, and to capitalize on the climactic moment. ~The
political actions will be assisted by economic warfare to induce failure
of the Communist regime to supply Cuba's economic needs, psychological
operations to turn the peoples! resentment increasingly against the regime,
and militazy-type groups to give the popular movement an action arm for
sabotage and armed resistance in support of political objectives.

The failure of the U.S.-sponsored operation in April 1961 50 shook
-the faith of Cuban patriots in U.S. competence and intentions in support-
ing a revolt against Castro that a new effort to generate a revolt against
the regime in Cuba must have active support from key Latin American
countries. Further, the foreigness (Soviet Union and Bloc) of the tyranny
imposed on the Cuban people must be made clear to the people of the
Western Hemisphere to the point of their deep anger and open actions to
defend the Western Hemisphere against such foreign invasion. Such an
anger will be generated, in part, by appeals from the popular movement
within Cuba to other Latin Americans especialiy.

The preparation phase must result in a political action organization

im being in key localities inside Cuba, with its own means for internal
communications, its own voice for psychological operations, and its own
action arm (small guerrilla bands, sabotage squads, etc.). It must have
the sympathetic support of the majority of the Cuban people, and make this
fact known to the outside world, (It is reported that the majority of Cubans
4 are-not for the present regime, but are growing apathetic towards what
appears to be a hopeless future or the futility of their ctatus.)

= The climactic moment of revolt will come from an angry reaction of
the people to a government action (sparked by an incident), or from a

will capitalize on this climactic moment by initiating an open revolt.
Areas will be taken and held. If necessary, the popular movement will
appeal for help to the Iree nations of the Western Hemiéphere.—The~
ted States, if possible in concert-with other Western Hemisphere
nations, will then give open support to the Cuban peoples’ revolt. Such
support will include military force, as ie eee

Il. ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION

.Our planning requires sound intelligence estimates of the situation
re Cuba. The latest National Estimate (SNIE 85-61) of 28 November
1961 contains operational conclusions not based on hard fact, in addition
to its intelligence conclusions; this is a repetition of an error in the
planning for the unsuccessful operation of last April.

The planning indicated herein will be revised, as necessary, based
on the hard intelligence estimate of the situation by the U.S. Intelligence
community. A new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE 85-62 on Cuba),
due on 23 January, apparently has been postponed until 7 February.

It is recognized that one result of the Project, so far, has been to
start the collection of Intelligence on Cuba in depth, to provide facts on
which to base firm estimates and operations.

IV, INITIAL PHASE
(30 Nov 61 - 18 Jan 62)

A. Establish a U.S, mechanism for the project.

Status: The President's directive of 30 November 1961 was imple- ~
mented by creating a U.S. operations team, with Brig. Gen. Lansdale |
as Chief of Operations, and with tasks promptly assigned. His immedi-
ate staff are Mr, Hand and Major Patchell. Representatives of Secre-
taries and Agency Directors are:

State - Woodward (Goodwin, Hurwitch)

CIA - Helms
Defense - Brig. Gen, Craig

USIA - Wilson

B. Intelligence Support

Status: CLA made a special survey of U.S. capabilities to interrogate .

Cuban refugees in the USA (1, 700 - 2,000 arriving per month) and on

— 16 January approved a program increasing the staff at the Opa Locka
inteFrogation Center in Florida {rom the present 2 people to 34, CIA will
build up agent assets (positive intelligence assets inside Cuba are very
limited and it has no counter-intelligence assets inside), Special intelli-
gence assets will be exploited more fully. The Cuba project needs far
more hard intelligence in depth than is presently available, CLA will
require further assistance from Defense and other U.S. organizations
in this intelligence effort, and is submitting specific qualifications for
pereonnel on 19 January. oH

Cc. Political platform for peoples! movement inside Cuba.

Statue: State has sketched in a broad outline. CIA is to produce
i the firm platform statement of aims for which the Cubans who will
operate inside Cuba are willing to Fisk iBeir lives, and upon which

‘ popular support can be generated.

D. Nucleus for popular movement

Status: To date, CLA has been unable to produce the necessary
political action agents for this purpose. Upon re-evaluation of its
capabilities, CLA now hopes to complete spotting and assessing eight
z to ten Cuban political action agents by 1S February, from among i
: Cubans available in the_United States, The minimum need for the
Project to be effectivelis 30|such political action Cubans and CLA is
. tasked to make a priority search for them among Cubans in the U.S.
and Caribbean area.

E. Deployment of nucleus

Status: CLA is tasked to select 20 localities within Cuba where
political action groups can be established. Initial selection and plans
for establishing these action groups are now due | February. Havana,
and localities in the provinces of Camaguey and [as Villas will receive
priority consideration, according to present intelligence. Planning on
this must be adjusted as firmer intelligence is acquired. i

F. Diplomatic actions

Status: State is concentrating on the OAS Meeting of Foreign
Ministers, which opens 22 January, hoping to get wide Western Hemis-
phere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it
from the rest of the Hemisphere. A companion resolution, to offer
OAS relief directly to the suffering Cuban people (similar to U.S.
relief to Russia, 1919-20) is being considered, as a means to reach
the Cuban people sympathetically wjshout going through their Com-
munist government. The OAS m is to be supported by syste) 4,2, YS

‘The major task for our diplomatic capability is to encourage La
American leaderé to develop independent operations similar to this Pro-
Ject, seeking an internal revolt of the Cuban people against the Communist
Fegime. This is yet to be initiated by State and must be vigorously pressed.

. G. Economic warfare

Status: This critical key to our political action Project is still in the
planning stage under State leadership, State is basing furure economic
actions, including plans for an embargo on Cuban trade, on the outcome
of the forthcoming OAS meeting. Meanwhile, State has chaired an Economic
action group, which agreed on developing 13 actions. 15 February js set for

J. Military actions a : Seeeeiaex diay

Status: Defense has been tasked with preparing a contingency plan
for_U.S. military action, in case the Cuban people request U.S, help
when their revolt starts making headway. This contingency plan will
permit obtaining a p cy “decision on the major point of U.S. intentions,
and is looked upon as a positive political-psychological factor ina
people's revolt, even more than as a possible military action, Defense
also has been tasked with fully assisting State and CIA, as commitments
of Defense men, money, and materiel are required.

UK. Major elements of the population

Status: Both State and CIA are continuing to explore their capabilities
{with results largely negative to date) for mounting special group operations
inside Cuba focused upon dynamic elements of the population, particularly
operations through the Church to reach the women and families, and
through Labor contacts to reach the workers. Other elements include
enlistment of the youth and professional groupings. Special consideration
is to be given to doing this through Latin American operational contacts.
This is vital to the success of our political action nucleus when CLA can

pyt it into place.

L. Outlook”

: Status: As reported to the Special Group last week, there has been a
period of a realistic second look at CIA capabilities to mount the required
clandestine operations against Cuba, and a subsequent start in "tooling up."
After this second look, CIA has concluded that its realistic role should be

to create at least the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support
for it, to improve CLA operational capability, and to help create a climate
which will permit provocative actions in support of a shilt to overt act action, —
This outlook, although arrived at thoughtfully within CIA, is far short of

the Cuba project's goals. CLA must take yet another hard look at its
potential capabilities, in the light of the following tasking, to determine

if it cannot make the greater effort required.

VI, FUTURE PLANS

By 20 February, it is expected that sufficient realistic plans for
individual tasks will have been received, and initial actions started, to
permit a firm time-table to be constructed, Since the President directed
that the Chief of Operations conduct the Project through the appropriate
organizations and Departments of the Government, and since these U.S.
organizations are mainly in the initial inventory and development of
capabilities phase concerning assigned tasks, 3 precise operations time -
table as of today would be too speculative to be useful.

Mluding two submarines, PT boats, Coast Guard type cutters,
es trainers, C-54 aircraft, F-86 aircraft, amphibiaa air-

so, CLA apparently believes that its role |~
should be to create a a popular movement, illusory and actual, gy RE
which will create a political climate which can provide a framework of
