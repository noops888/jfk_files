LEFTIST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES-Soviet Directed Insurgency

(S) (Gp-1)

A Soviet Embassy official In Mexico City,

Nikolai S: LEONOV,

1s allegedly actively planning an insur-

gent movement in Latin America.

LEONOV left Mexico for the

USSR on 21 April to confer with: KHRUSHCHEV and CASTRO.

Credence is given this report by the publication of a photo-

graph of the three on 8 May in a Cuban newspaper.

The pho

tograph was purportedly taken during a recent meeting.

Sorence

(S) (Gp-]) Cuba and Mexico, according to LEONOV's

schemes, would serve as bases for

the insurgency.. Cuba

would be the "invisible beachhead" and Mexico the point for

covert distribution of arms.

lar activity in Guatemala about a year ago.

(S) (Gp-3) Another report from sources in Colombia

stated that pro-CASTRO ex-President CARDENAS planned to

call a meeting in Mexico City of "leftist bent", disgrun-

tled retired military officers from Latin American coun

tries on the subject of insurgency: (DIA, 3 June 1963)
