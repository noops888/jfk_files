1. a. The cryptonym /FUUBE is apparently a garble andJFUSURE
is probably meant instead. This is a cryptonyn belonging to LA
Division assigned to a U.S. citizen ‘formerly of operational interest
to us. His true name cannot be divulged because, according to our
records, he still resides abroad in the country against which he
was targeted as a reporting source. Revelation of his identity and
of his past association with us would besdangerous to his security.
b. The cryptonym KUTUBE referred to FI Staff, now known

as the Operations Staff. «4.

ie The cryptony IVID was assigned to a Yugosla

3. Mr. Harvey was issued the pseudonym Daniel M. PRESLAND in

1956 and he used this pseudonym until he retired in 1967. This is the
only pseudonym he used in connection with the ZRRIFLE Project and Cuban
operations. Mr. Harvey was issued the alias William WALKER in May

1962 and he continued to use it while he was Chief of the Cuban
operations until he was reassigned in June 1963. There is no indication
in the file that Mr. Harvey used this alias in connection with the
ZRRIFLE Project. There is no record that Mr. Harvey was ever issued

or used a cryptonym.
