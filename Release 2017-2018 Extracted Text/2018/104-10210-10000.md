"Oswald" Letter to US Embassy, Stockhols.

R garding the language in the subject lettar, wich isn't standard engiish, 1t

1s ilfficult to say that 1t raflects azy particular foreign (non-inglish) backgrounde

"Outsmug led" 1g Gerrande;- and "Sowiat" may be Gormando or Slavic,

and both way

cend to be suggestive. However, a Chinese who has studied several European

languages may easily mix the Idions or spellings of any of then in an effort

at Enzlish composition.

nayo is not

"2" 19 9000

In the now Chirose Camunist national systom, but never in combination with

"Ryo" 1s a Japanese spelling.

In the nana given it is not known whether the Chinese or western presentation

Is used, or, in other words, whether "Ryo" dr "YUan" 19 meanù to be the surnase.

Among Chinese syllables which could be represented by the Japanese "Ryo" are

klao, Llang and Lung.

Of these Lung (TC: 7893) and Liang (IC: 2733) are used

as surnanes. In either case, "Ryo"-18 hardly a nane by which a real frinese

would identlly hinsell.

The unit which keeps record of Chinese Cormunist diplomatic and official

personnel abroad will very probanly in able to determina wether thera 18

an actual person in the Chinese Comunist Embassy In Stockholn witn whos the

Dane given in the lettor can be consocted. The Us inbassy. vill have Leare

of loaming whether that person was in Stockholm at the time of the letter

writing, and wethar he has subsequently been removed.

The Fresident

0f the United jutas it America, John A loanedy ras

assassinated by Ict H Oswald by direct order of the government of

the Peoples Republic of China. Ice H

Oswald executed the act alore

but there nas helpers and resorv. "How ill is over" wus password

to his custoners. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but be

must assassinate kennedy. Ve etablised contact with Oswald already

when he nas in somiet but then to try to get hin as a spy for China.

Ister he vas spy for us. When lee E Osrald had returced to USA ve

cunthered nim auer acd iresuened up my mind you have been a suy

for us" and told his what could happen to him if FBI got inforued.

How we had him. He got his last information in jexico. /It was not

gocd to assassinate Lennedy in dexico/ "Fair Play for cuba" was

staried only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro zor the ag-

ssassinetus. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion wus behind the assassin

ation. Then Cuba was attacied by US: Soniet must help Castro defend

himself. I, that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi

ted. We should be allieted with Soviet then me would ass them for ^

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us, te and Soviet should

win: this. we and whole the worls should be Cormnistic. Then we should

essassinate trustjer and other sowcet leadors and we would be leader

of the NiH 372. Then this letzer wiil reach you they have maled

away with ni and all that knowes the plancs. This letter is outsmugoled

from our Embassy in Stockholm where the imbassy is aighinese spy-sacol. *

My name is ?yo Lang Tian, Officer in the department for State-secret.

If you do not belive this letter explein our hate to USi.
