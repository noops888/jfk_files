fieccl roed blocks which had delayed such payments during 1962 have now
boen remved. He assured us that A/2 will now receive the same prompt
paynerte afforded members of his staff.

&. A/2 18 aware that KUBARK has complete control over the level «f
his compensation and can exercise editcrial contrcl over his program.
Ee undonbtedly remembers that during last year hie payments were
decreased frm $3,000.00 to $2,500.00, on the recommendation of JMNAVE.

5. There is no question of the ability of A/2 to attract and hold
an ewilence. Listensr response to his programs has been greater than
that of any othor single program. In view of hie present end potential
usefulness, it is rec-mmended that ccntrols un A/2 be limited to
woporviaion of his redio program and that no ef'fort bs made to restrain
bis political or personal activities mless they tend to discredit him
66 & radio personality amd hence destroy his usefulness t. KUBARK «. Be
