was in shallow water, the U. S. Coast Guard discontinued
its surveillance of the "Violyn ILI" by boat, and the sur-
veillence was taken over by U. S. Coast Guard aircraft.

At about 8:20 °P.M., the "Violyn IIL" turned off its running

time.

fishing boat which was stopped near Williams Key off the
coast of jndrews Island on April 5, 1963. MM T-4 said this
Sigma boat was possibly the boat that was supposed to rendez~
vous with the "Violynn III" for an infiltration mission in-
to Cuba. There is an airplane landing strip at Willians Key:
which could not be used because someone had placed a great
quaatity of rocks and driftwood on the runway.
