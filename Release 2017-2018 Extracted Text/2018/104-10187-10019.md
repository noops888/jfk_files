5) PHOTO COVERADE - GENERAL

During the f month perlod frou 1 November to 1 August 196k, the LTEMPTY

project produced approximately T70 rolla of operational still photographe,

of vulch 595 rolls were direatly concerned with the LiniCK target.

This

coverage, linked with the dally lose kopt by the basehouse keepere of the

activities of the WRICK personnel, watle contimully contributing to.

the Station'e regular CE offort, has been particularly effective during

crite times much as the OPFLOOR investigations. wallo the photographie

coverase is used almost oxclusively for station operations in the lINERICk

arce, LIPTY has also provided direct support to other operation such ae

providing verification of a double agent'a visite to the LIMRICK

Installation.

6) Oliver de SCANNO

Durinis the parlod 1 December 1963 through 30 August 1964, Long-term Station

asset,. Oliver Q. SCANTLINO (pa) contimed as the cutout

to the LINKIED

basebouse, and made his regular contribution as the alternate contact of

LICASA-1 in this senaltive LAURICLE operation. SCANILINO also performad

mmerous pretext Investigations, serviced accommodation addresses, and

propared formal casing reporte.

Of particular significance were

OL SCANTLIND' regular checka of the accounodation address used in the

sensitive (LE PUlsE loperation,

the thorough Investigation of a former

-Of" snori agent of interest to KUBARk, and detalled casinge of the Chinese

Communiet Palr, (See also Section VI, PLANS, fOr SCANTLING'e future

operational assigment).

7)

Raymond E. OBRENDE

During the perfod under review, GERENDE continued in his assignment se

the Station cutout to the LILYRIC and LICALIA basehouses, the LIEVIRAP

unit and as the processor of the raw photographic take, and with the

ascistance of LIDOTT-10,

continued to provide and service the majority

of the accommodation addresses used by the Station.

The contributiona

nade principally by GERENDE (and to a limited extent by BCANTLINO) to the

sensitive AMROD operation can accurately be described an unique and

ossential to the success of that operation. Although this activity 1e

necessarily a Headquarters directed effort, the local contributions or

OBRANDE and SCANITINO are integral ingredients of that operation.

D. 'It will ba noted from the above samples of LIEMPTY contributions to the

station's progress tovards fulfillment of the pertinent sections of the

Related Mission Directive, that notwithstanding their demonstrable value

and importance, these, contributions actually represent only a portion of

the setivity directed towarde the fulfillment of each objective. Therefore,

any precise measurement of project progresa la procluded.

However, based

on the performance and overall contributions of the LIEUPTY project during

the past project year, the Station concludes that thie project 10 essential

to the fulfillment of the Related Mission Directive and must be continued

during the fortheoning project year.

CRANOSS

'A)

On 2$ Septenber 1964, the Station was Informed by Headquarters that a

LEViTY project photogruph maich was one of several supplied to the Warren

Cormission In November 1903, would be publlahed in that Commission's formal

overt report: since LINERICK officiale vould undoubtedly be able to

recognise the individual in. the photographe in a visitor to their

Installation and with a vler towirds the atterdant possible security problema,

the IMITED, LILYRIC, aNd LICALLA operations wore suspended on 26 and 27

September and all photographie

and other comproulsing equipuent vas evacuated

troa these basehouses,: ALl basehouse personnel were briefed in general on the

situation and specifically on how to cope with any possiblo Inquiries frou

Coverent offiolale or IntrIcK Inaptred of prompted newsmen.

Complete

enerrency coumnications systemi vere arranged for all banehouse personnel,

Raymond H, GERINDE and Oliver d. SCANTLINO, Upon riceipt by the Station of a

copy of the photograph, It vas determined that the LIMITED banehouse had

providod the photogriph in questton..

Inta consideration, linked with further

analyala of the limitations upon any courteractions avallable to LItrICK

officials, allowed the Station to re motivate the LILYRIC and LICALLA bases

on a phased baste in early October 1964, However, because LIMTTED was the

originator of the to be-published photograph and due to the ago and deterio

ratel condition of the LITED property (owned by KUBARK), Station Mexico

City did not reactivate LJMITED and presented to Headquartors a plan for the

demolition of the present IMITED structure vith recommendations for the

construction of a new building complex. (See MEXI 1307 dated 20 Octobar 1964

for additional detalla).

. B)

In accorvance vith paragraph 2 of HNW-12291 dated 28 January 196h, the

value and productivity of all assete under Project LIEMPTY was closely

reviewed againet the necessary security and efficiency requirements.

It was

deterained that LIEMPTY-I2 and LIEMPTY-8 could be terminated without causing

Intolerable sapa in operational coverage or an unacceptable decrease in

Both LIEFTY-12 and LTEMPTY-8 were terminated on 30 June 19648

at the sane time, lu leaping with the ODYOKE economy progran, a further effort

vas made to roduce the costs of this project by placing LIENPTY-19 on an

hourly rate for work performed for the Station.
