1. CURRENT OBJBCTIVES AND RELATED PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

A. The overall objéctive-of-the LIEMPTY project activity te to collect
operational information on the LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well
as related targets of opportunity, through stationary and mobile photo- i:
graphic and physical surveillance coverage. Corollary objectives which are
to be fulfilled through the use of the LIENPTY installations and personnel
ere as follows - .

1) To provide operational information pertaining to the dsily activities
end movements of LIMERICK personnel, particularly those individuals of
intelligence interest, as well as information on the LIMERICK physical

facilities and visitors to the premises,

2) To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, other official Installations, and persons of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico. i

3) To provide operational support and other protective services to Station
Personnel and operations as may be deemed necessary,

B, The above objectives are to be fulfilled through the use of vhe LIMITED,
LILYRIC, and LICALLA fixed installations, the LIEVTRAP mobile unit, and the
services of ‘contract agents Raymond H, GERENDE and Oliver G. SCANILINO. These
objectives are in consonance vith and represent partial fulfillment of the
following wections of the current Related Mission Directive as approved for
Mexico City Station?

Priority A, Section 1, Subsection @
Priority A, Section 2, Subsection ¢

€, Throughout the period under review, Project LIEMPTY continued to contribute
directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and Headquarters’
requests and requirements for coverage of various targets falling within the
framework of the above cited objectives and the Related Mission Directive.
Specific examples of LIEMPTY progress, accomplishments ani contributions by

each project component are és follows!

2) Laas

Throughout the reporting period, until operational activity was terainated
, and the photographic equipment evacuated from the LINITED basehouse on

26 Septeaber 1! (because of security implications stewing from the

release of the Warren Comission report, see Section II, CHANGES), ‘the

LIMITED installation provided daily photographic coverage and physical

- surveillance of the main gate of LIMERICK installation during the afternoon

and early evening hours. The Station considers the LINITED photographic

of the target personnel ani the arrival ani departure of visitors, sone of
vbou have been PEFRINGrs. In addition, the LINITED installation provided
fein bering + conie pipebdlnd ibe diore crits eam, Because of the
extremely tight, security. ueasures instituted by the local seurity forces
in the imiediate vicinity of the LIMERICK installation, stakeouts by the

surveillance team are precluded. Hovever, with LIMITED
‘Personnel dispatching the team from positions removed from the protective
security ring, onto targets departing the installation, surveillance
coverage is made posd ble.

BALA hd

‘The LILYRIC installation also provided photographic end fixed visual gu~
veillance of the front of the LINERICK installation throughout the period
under review, during the morning and early afternoon hours. This photo-
graphic coverage and the written logs of the movement of LIMERICK
personnel prepared by LILYRIC personnel, couplowents the LIMITED coverage
used by the Station in its KUDESK operations against the LIMERICK target
and has been Judged to be of equal quality ani value to the LINITSD

coverage.

EICALLA

The LICALLA installation continued to provide coverage of the back of

-the LIMERICK installation, the garden, and patio area where many of the
Personnel and their faxilies congregate, This coverage gives the Station
its real insight into the LIMERICK target ani provides @ large part of the
{nformation-on which the Station bases ite identification of LIMERICK
staffers, their rank ‘afi positions, the staffing estimates, and the
intelligence connections of the various officers. In addition some
information of LAVRTGLS interest 10 provided by LICALLA (see paragraph 2,
section f of HNMA-24235 dated 2 September 1964 for further details).

LTENTRAR :
A grestly increased use of the LIENTRAP unit was evidenced throughout
the period under review. This asset vas employed extensively for photo~
graphic coverage of PCN Heaiquarters, the PCN Vouen's Congress, the hones
of PCM wenbers, and the residences of foreign Comuntst exiles in Mexico.
Nuch of thie coverage vas in support of past or planned recruitment
atteapta ‘and Wes néeded to. provide identifications of other local or

visiting Commmists. Specifically LIENTRAP coverage assisted in the
identification and the verification of the address and contacta of

o2 ca 5-1, prior to the Station's successful recruituent of thie high-

PCM member. The section primarily responsible for the Station's
anti-PCM activity has classified the LISNTRAP coverage as a most

“valuable” part of their effort,

During the period 1 December 1963 through 30 August 1964, long-ters Station
asset, Oliver 0, SUANTLING (ps) continued as the cutout to the LIMITED
‘basehouse, and made his regular contribution as the alternate contact of
LICASA~1 in this sensitive ‘LAURICLE operation. SCANTLING also performed
numerous pretext investigations, serviced accomodation addresses, and
prepared formal casing reports. Of particular significance were
SCANTLING's regular checks of the accommodation address used in the
sensitive | eration, the thorough investigation of a foruer

‘SMOTH Jegent ‘of interest to KUDARK, and detailed casings of the Chinese

st Fair, ‘ (See also Section a VE, PLANS, for SCANTLING's future

operational assignment),

7) Ragmond Hy GFRENDS ©

During the period unter review, GERENDE continued in his assignment as

- the Station cutout to the LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses, the LIENTRAP
unit and as the processor of the rav photographic take, and with the

” gsotstance of LIE@TY-10, continued to provide and service the majority

of the accommodation addresses used by the Station, The contributions
usde principally. by GERENDE (and to a limited extent by SCANTLING) to the
sensitive AMROD operation can accurately be described as unique and
essential to the success of that operation, Although this activity is
necessarily a Headquarters directed effort, the local contributions of
GERENDE and SCANTLING are integral ingredients of thet operation.

‘It will be noted froa.the above samplea of LIEMPTY contributions to the
Station's progress towards fulfillment of the pertinent sections of the
Related Nission Directive, that notwithstanding their demonstrable value
and importance, these contributions actually represent only e pertion of
the activity directed towards the fulfillment of each objective. Therefore,
eny precise measurenent of project progresa 1s precluded, However, based
on the performnce and overall contributions of the LIENPTY project during
the past project year, the Station concludes that thie project is essential
" to the fulfiliment of the Related Mission Directive and mist be continued

during the forthcoming project year.

‘A) On 2b Septender 1964, the Station vas informed by Headquarters thet a
LIRGTY project photograph which was one of several supplied to the Warren
Commission in Novewber 1953, would be published in that Comalseton's formal
overt report. Since LINERICK officials would undoubtedly be able to
recognize the individual in the photographs as a visitor to their
installation and with a view tovards the atteridant possible security problems, °
the LIMITER, LILYRIC, and LICALLA operations wore suspended on 26 and 27
Septeuber ahd all photographic and other comprouiaing equipment vas evacuated
froa these baseliousées --All basehouse personnel vere briefed in general on the
situation and ‘specifically on:hov.to cope with any possible inquiries frou
Government officials ar LIMERICK inspire? or prompted nevenen, Complete
emergency poumunications systeug yere arranged for all basehouse personnel,
Raywond H, QERENDE and Cliver G. SCANTLING, Upon recéipt by the Station of a
copy of the photograph, it vas determined that the LIMITED basehouse ‘had
provided the photograph in question.. Tits consideration, linked with further
analysis of the limitations upon any counteractions available to LIMERICK
officials, allowed the Station to re-activate the LILYRIC and LICALLA bases
on a phased basie in early October 1964, Hovever, because LIMITED was the
originstor of the to-be-published photograph and due to the age and deterio~
rated condition of the LDQTED property (owned by KUBARK), Station Mexico
City did not reactivate LIMITED and presented to Headquarters a plan for the
demolition of the present LINITED structure with recoumendations for the
construction of.a new building complex. (See MEXI 1307 dated 20 October 196%

for additional details).

3B) In acconiance with paragraph 2 of HMMW~12297 dated 28 January 1964, the
value and productivity of all assets under Project LIENPTY vas closely
revieved against the necessary security and effictency requirenents, It was
detornined that LIEMPTY-12 and LIENPTY-8 could be terminated without causing
intolerable gaps in operational cores at unacceptable decrease in
efficiency, Both LIEMPTY-12 ana ~8 were terminated on 30 June 19645
at the same time, in keeping with the ODYOKE economy program, a further effort
vas aie to reduce the costs of thie project by placing LIEMPTY-19 on an

hourly rate for work performed for the Station,

C) 0m 30 September 1964, the field Case Officer responsibility for Project
‘LISMPTY was transferred fros Jerewy L. NIARCOS to Cornelius L, PEUVION ’
however, the analysis of the finished take from the photographic basehouses

continues to be performed by Robert 5, RIGGS,

III, ERFSCTIVENESS .

‘The effectiveness of the LISMPTY project mst be judged on the basis of the
reliable daily coverage provided rapidly and securely for the Station and
interested Headquarters’ components on the LIMERICK installation; the rapid
mobile coverage provided resularly by LIENTRAP; and the support to these and
other operations provided by Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver @. SCANTLING,
(See Section I, Subsection C for specific examples of this effectivensss).

In the opinion of Station officers tho use the LIEMPTY photographic product or
receive LIEMPTY operational support, this project has responded most satisfactorily
to the needs and requirenents. .

‘The only eajor operational/secarity problem which confronted project LIEMPTY
during the period under review were the security taplications stemming frog the
release of the overt Warren'Comaiseton report, (See paragraph II, Section A).
The precise damage. occasioned locally by the report, cannot be measured until
the mid-Noveaber release of the twport annex containing the actual LDCTED
photograph, During the interis period, the emergency contact systems are
being maintained in readiness, the cover storiss of all personnel involved
have been: reviewed: and ‘strengthened, and no undue concern has been displayed
by any of the project personnel. Potential Stetion counterweasures to the
posetble LDGRICK reaction to the publication of the subject photograph were
outlined in NEXI-1018 dated’ 25 September 1964,

No wumsual personnel problems have arisen and the overall performance of all
agents connected with this project bas been satisfactory.

‘Phe future of the LIMITED basebouse, property ani personnel vill be determined
within the near future. (Seo Section 2, subsection a).Station bas acquired
another apartaent.on a teuporary besis in the LILYRIC complex to replace the
loss of LIMITED coverage and it vill be activated after the acquisition and
clearence of basehouse keepers.

Ho basic changes are contemplated in either the administration or operation

of the LICALLA or LILYHIC ‘bases, Station will sgain initiate motion picture
* coverage of selected LIMERICK personnel engaged in conversation in the

garden area in an attempt to obtain film which will lend itself to lipreading

by Headquarters’ specialists.

The Station plans to maintain the increased level of LIENTRAP operational
activity, with this asset being targetted in the near future againat the
Partido Popular Soctalista (PPS) in support of the Station's new PPS
penetration program.

Effective on 1 September-1964, Raysoni H, GEHENDE assumed the cutout role
and responsibility for the LDOTSD basehouss in addition to his other
operational duties outlined in Section I. . No other basic operational or

administretive changes are plannei for OERENDE for the ensuing period.

A) Past Project Year - Station records indicate that Project LIENPTY
$5,952.78 during the period 1 ‘Deceuber 1963 through 30 Septeuber 1!
Approximately $9,000 vill be expended during the reuainder of the present
Project year, It 1a estimated that approximately 20 hours of case officer
time per week ia necessary to satisfectorily fulfill the operational,
administrative and analytical requirements of this project. Bi-weekly
accoutings with receipts and/or certifications are subaitted by Raymond H.
GERENDE and Oliver G, SCANTLING to the Station Finance Officer, via the
ease officer for all Project LIEMPTY expenditures,

B) Ensuing Project Year - Project LIEMPTY wes programed for $60,000 for the
forthcoming project years Due to the Station's economy measures, hovever,

this’ project of their recontact instructions and verbal recognition stgnals. In
addition the euergency contact plans for the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA base-
house. keepers were expanded and refined during the "crisis" outlined in para-
