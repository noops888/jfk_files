B. Reaction to Assassination of

President KENNEDY

Speaking in New York City on November 27,

1963, FARRELL DOBBS stated that the Party was very

upset over the fact that LEE HARVNY OSWALD, the

accused assassin

of President KENNEDY, was reported

in possession of a copy of

"The Militant"

According to DOBBS, SWP files reflected that

OSWALD had a subscription to the publication

which expired in September, 1963.

However, he

was still receiving copies of the paper at

time of the assassination, November 22, 1963.

It is the policy of "The Militant" to continue

sending issues subsequent to the subscription

expiring in the anticipation that it might be

renewed.

According to DOBBS, the SWP was

distressed over the fact that it possessed

information possibly pertinent to inquiries

being conducted by the Bovernment concerning

the dosass nation. 4(4)

The Party could not, without embarrassment,

furnish this information to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation DOBBS said, so the information

was

made available to the

"New York Times'' through a

lawyer retained by the Party.

This action was

taken in an attempt to get the Party "off the

hook" in regard to information it had concerning

OSWALD.

NY T-6

December 4, 1963

It is noted that in the edition of the

'New York Times" of November 27, 1963, the following

was

printed:

"Publishers of "The Militant', a weekly

newspaper here that reflects views of the Socialist

Workers party but is not an official organ of

that

Trotskyite, group, said yesterday they had found

that OSWALD had been briefly a subscriber.

"A spokesman said OSWALD had sent in

$1 for a four month introductory subscription in

December, 1962 and renewed this for another four

months at $1, expiring in September, 1963, with

no further communication indicated in the records.

"The mere fact that a person subscribes to

a publication, a spokesman added, is no indication

of whether or not he is sympathetic to any position the

publication espouses - sometimes just the opposite"

•

A letter was sent by DOBBS to all branch

organizers

of the SWP on November 27, 1963 setting

forth that the current issue of "The

Militant"

would deal extensively with the assassination of

President KENNEDY and the political aftermath.

He recommended that balanced judgment.

be exercised in all Party activities in view of

the many political implications of the assassina-

tion.

He said that there was a "smear attack"

against the socialist movement which created

unknown factors concerning the present public

attitudes. DOBBS cautioned that it would be

necessary to feel the way carefülly. into the

changed situation. DOBBS further wrote that

for the present, the role of the SW would be

to help others

think out,

the basic meaning

of the changed political situation.

He said

that it would be a serious mistake

to try to

immediately resume activity at the tempo. and

scope that prevailed before the assassination.

DOBBS enclosed photostats of the article

appearing in the New York Times of November 27,

1963.

NY T-4

December 4, 1903

In "The Militant" of December 2, 1963

there was set forth a public statement issued

by FARRELL DOBBS as National Secretary of the SWP

immediately following the assassination of

President KENNEDY.

The

statement condemned

the assassination as an inhuman, anti-social

and criminal act, and sympathy was extended to

Mrs. KENNEDY and her children. It set forth

that the assassination stemmed from an atmosphere

created by racists and ultra-conservative forces.

Reviewing the political outlook at

the SWP plenum on December 27, 1963, FRED HALSTEAD

said it was still not clear what the finenoial fal

reaction would be, but for the present there was

a definite

smear

against the socialist movement

because President KENNEDY had been assassinated

by an avowed Marxist.

HALSTEAD said he did not

believe there would be a witch hunt

however,

because the United States Government was too

afraid of world opinion.

HALSTEAD further said that the direct

effect on the Party since November 22, 1963 had

been at a minimum.

He said the police had

come to the SWP Rational headquarters in New

York, but there was no reason to think their

presence was anything other than what was

claimed, protection against counter-revolu-

tionary

activity.

He said the largest anti-

Trotskÿist indications had been in Blooming-

ton, Indiana.

commended that the SWP line should be to em-

phasize his claims of innocence. It was rec-

commended that the Party stay away from any

Trotskyist versus right wing discussions.

Speaking to the plenum on December

29, 1963, EDWARD SHAW also

noted that there

had been

some increase in " the witch hunt"

since the assassination, but felt that the

SWP propaganda offensive could overcome

this.

NY T-3

December 29, 1963

In a letter sent by FARRELL DOBBS to

another SWP leader, foklowing the SWP plenum,

DOBBS said the SWP

would remain in the back-

ground and wait for further developments.

said the Party was watching the proceedings

of the WARREN Commission very carefully and

would decide future action after analyzlagain

the Commission's report.

On January 27, 1964, FARRELL DOBBS was

interviewed in the presence of his attorney,

ROWLAND WArdS, at 112 East 19th Street, New

York, New York. DOBBS was interviewed by

Special Agents ALESIO SAVIOLA and ANTHONY D.

LEONE, who advised DOBBS that the Presidential

Commission investigating the assassination

of President KENNEDY had specifically requested

the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain

from the SWP any data concerning LEE HARVEY

OSWALD.

WATTS stated that DOBBS searched the

SWP files and had found that OSWALD had a

trial subscription to "The Militant"

OSWALD

also sent a letter to the SWP setting forth

a change of address and another indicating a

desire to join the organization,

According

to WATTS, this latter letter was answered in

a routine manner to the effect that it took

more than just filing out an application to

become an SWP member. OSWALD was told that

since there was no SWP branch in his locality,
