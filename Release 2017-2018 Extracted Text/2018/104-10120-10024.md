Author: Edward J, Hamilton

ike
A letter from Tom wanes of Holt, Rhinehart and Winston,

Inc. book publishers dated July 9, 1968 and addressed to Bill
Buckley of the National Review discusses te subject publication
and indicates that Holt, Patel declined publication because the
manuscript by Hamilton was considered "far too controversial",
A note from Saroyan Fee the manuscript indicated that
Buckley had sent this eee to Arlington House. A Henry

\
Durkin now publicity manager fhe Walker and Company handled
this manuscript while he, Durkin, \ as working for Arlington House
some time ago. Walker and compa have just recently declined
to publish the manuscript apparently ee same reason as Holt,
Rhinehart and Arlington House. It was Roted that Arlington House

rejected the manuscript as controversial because they had no way of

checking out the facts.


A, review of the first few pages of the manuscript rather
oe
arin show this to be the work of E. Howard Hunt (OS file #23500),
presently a staff employee assigned to the European Division of
DDP. The. following items cued from the manuscript were
compared with factual data in Mr. Hunt's security file:
: ee ; 7
a) Manuscript, page 6- The air was cool on this second
day of December 1956...... twenty of us were seated
\
around the\spacious office of the fon. Arthur Gardner,
- aX 7
American Ambassador to Cuba" (then in Havana)
Hunt's file--travel order dated 19 November 1956 authorized

Hunt to travel to ‘and from Havanga on TDY during the period

7-15 December 1956.

b)_Manuscript, page\s, 9--'In 1926, at the height of the
Florida boom, my father was practicing law in Miami Beach’,
the manuscript goes on to, indicate that Subject's father had a
serious problem with his business partner which related to
missing funds and the partnership was dissolved.
Hunt's file--Subject's personal istory statement reveals that
Subject's father was an attorney. \A Dun and Bradstreet report
dated 16 January 1945 indicated that when Subject's father was
with L. R. Steel Company as an attorney in the 20's that the

\

company failed with disastrous results,\ however, Subject's
father was exonerated after an investigation.


¢) Manuscript, -Page 10--"In March of 1960 I was having
coffee with the newly -elected President of the country

(Uruguay) to which Iwas assigned when a station officer
was 2amitted. " The manuscript goes on to indicate that

Hunt had to report to Washington.

Hunt's file--Hunt had been assigned to Montevideo, Uruguay

to have Hunt's tour extended in Uraguay. The file further
reflects a travel order dated 20 June 1960 which ordered
Hunt from Montevideo to Washington with travel to commence”
in early May 1960.

d) Manuscript, Page 19--"Having Served several years in
EP _page 19- ;

Mexico"

Washington on ] March 1955.

e) Manuscript, page 23--"Reporting my failure to Quarters

Eye I returnea to Washington and conferred with Barnes, Jake

and Bender, They recommended, and l agreed, that I ought to


people. Our cover staff provided aoe with documentation
that would support the operational alias I was to live with
for the duration of the Project: Edward J. Hamilton. I
drew a travel advance and flew to Tampa where I boarded a
National Airlines flight to Havana."

Hunt!s file--On 27 September 1960 action was taken to pro-

iT

vide alias documentation to Howard Hunt in the name of

Edward J. Hamilton. This documentation included a bonafide
District of Columbia driver's permit in alias including back-

oes resid&e address. Later, in June of 1963 a post office
box in Washington, D.C. was established for Hunt under the
name,Edward J. Hamilton.

A rather casual review of the rest of the manuscript indicates
general similarity 4 the descriptive data.of the author's ( Edward 5 Jail
Hamilton's) activities with regard to the Cuban situation Caen these-of-

fo" Gag ey) Hunt.ond Ais Orange ark,

It is quite clear that at least a number of minor compromises
of security are involved here. -Additionally, personal opinion regarding
a number of prominent and in some cases former Agency employees
could be considered controversial if not actually damaging. Beginning
on page 214, the manuscript describes General Cab é, role in the

Cuban episode and it can be assumed that this presentation would do


little to add to General Gabbté's reputation. Other references
throughout the manuscript may also produce provocative if not
alarming consequences when reviewed by those concerned or

described.
