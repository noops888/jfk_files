ADMINISTRATIVE

As the- Bureau was advised by reairtel, this
report has been delayed in order to obtain the results of
the trial in U. S. District Court, Pittsburgh, of subject,
his brother, and their associates on charges of income tax
fraud and evasion, plus conspiracy.

During the period of this report, liaison has
been closely maintained with Intelligence Division, Internal
Revenue, Service, Pittsburgh, which has an investigation
underway regarding this subject.

By radiogram, 11/19/63, Pittsburgh advised the
Bureau that on 11/18/63 PCI ANTHONY JOHN WISE, JR.,
advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, as follows:

On that date at about 4:30 P.M., SAM MANNARINO
stated "they" intended to try to get to Mrs. BROWN, wife
of Allegheny County Judge HOMER S. BROWN, who had been
selected to the jury in’U. S. District Court, Pittsburgh,
that day. MANNARINO said the BROWNs had a daughter who
was going with the son of PAUL LONG, Pittsburgh Radio and
Television News Commentator, and the approach would be
made through PAUL LONG. When asked how he knew LONG would
go for the deal, MANNARINO laughingly said he was positive
LONG would go for Oe oye

It is noted that Judge BROWN and his wife,
Mrs. WILHELMINA B. BROWN, are of the Negro race, and the
PAUL LONG family is Caucasian.

The above information was furnished to U. S.
Attorney GUSTAVE DIAMOND, Pittsburgh, who was scheduled to
commence presentation of the Government case against subjects
on November 19, 1963, on charges of income tax evasion.
USA DIAMOND requested that no active investigation be made
to prove or disprove the above allegation at that time for

fear of jeopardizing the case, but he suggested that contact
be maintained with the Pittsburgh Office source (PCI WISE)
in an effort to ascertain whether or not attempts to contact
Mrs. BROWN. had been made and if they had been successful.

On 11/21/63, PCI WISE advised SA FORSYTH as follows:

On 11/20/63, SAM MANNARINO stated that the "contact"
had been made with "Judge BROWN's wife." MANNARINO did not
indicate that the results of the contact had been successful
from his point of view and, in fact, appeared to be deeply
worried about the outcome of the trial. MANNARINO changed
one part of his story in that he now referred to Judge
BROWN's son going with the daughter of PAUL LONG, rather
than BROWN's daughter going with LONG's son, as had been
previously stated.

The above information was furnished to USA GUSTAVE
DIAMOND, Pittsburgh, on 11/21/63,

No further information regarding the above
allegations was furnished by PCI or any other source.
