ao Reurtel 5/25/62.

Referenced communication advised that an unknown
individual will arrive in New York from Italy 6/15/62, and this
unknown person would like to see "Paul and Gambino." In addition,
you advised that Bat Massi of Camden, New Jersey, was also
in conference with Angelo Bruno 5/24/62, and the unknown
individual who is to arrive from Italy 6/15/62 was discussed.

You are to insure that both the Newark and New York
Offices are completely aware of this information and that
appropriate coverage is given this matter. The Bureau should
be advised of all developments by teletype.

It would appear from referenced communication that
the individual who is coming to New York could possibly be
Joe Ida, who is presently residing in Italy.

Referenced communication also advises of a meeting
held at 740 Christian Street, Philadelphia, on 524/62. Bruno,
Massi, and other Philadelphia hoodlum characters were present
at this meeting. This meeting points out the need for the Al

Me

establishment, if possible, of a highly confidential source a
this location. You should give this matter complete considerati'
Furnish the Bureau your comments regarding the possible establish-
ment of such source at this location and if you feel same is
practicable, submit request for si ey authority
