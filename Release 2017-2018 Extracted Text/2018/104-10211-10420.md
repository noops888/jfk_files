Lament Ansesenent of Identity

7 ‘1,'X¢ ig requanted that Identity be asseesed for possible

~" recruiteant ag an reset against PROXUNER. HMEXE 4151, 4269, and
8433 plus travel listings show that Identity traveled to PERUMEM
and returned to Merico City on 13-41 April and 22 Jane-2 July
of this year. Headquarters traces rovealed that be was in
PSRUKEN to negotiate regarding his country's frozon assets there,
enc algo to negotiate for the release oz one of his countrymen who
had bees arrested for elleged espionage activities. Ye assume iz
that Identity's superior has sade Identity responsible for matters

*. pertaining to PAAUMEH, and that ho will be travelling to PBRULEN
tvo or three times a year. It would be important to determine the
guration of his present tour of duty; he bag already served there
three years. Other Headquarters traces on IDENTITY are forearded
ia Enclosure, as is a biographical eketch om Identity's father.
&s Kaclosure shovs (assuming only that Identity resided with big
father during bis teers), Identity spent his youth (from 8 to 21
years of aged in PRORIMB, graduating from a PBPRIME vaiversity.
Concidering his and his family's long residence here, there 19
@ reasonable likelihood that Identity is pro-PBPHIKE and would
be cooperative.

2. If agnesament is fevorable end recruitnent is recommended,
At ig suggested that the tnitial proposition be coached in terms
of Identity becoming a political obscrver for us, vot an espionage
agent; we prefer to solicit bis “confidential cooperation”, Loping

3. Im agsecsing him, it is of great intorest to determine
attiteds regarding whether or not hie goverment should te
formed of big cooperation. We would, of course, prefer a
enilatersl operation if it is poosible to conduct one vith a
resgcuable certainty that Identity will not interm his coverreent.
Hsvever, 1f he wishes his govermnont te know of his activities
on our beskal%, we have no eignificant objections to so iuferming
thea; bat ve vould prefer to present thom with a fait accompli:
1.00, “Identity hae agreed to work for ws. Yo are therefore
Asforming you FYK. Have you amy derogatory information or other
reason why you objecé to wer vetng hie a0 a political sicerver?™
Past axperience indicates that if ve can prenent the matter to
Xcentity's Intelligeace Service thusly, there is little likelihood
that they will deny us the opportunity to use am indivicual unless
there is deregatory informtion.

4. If the Station prefers not to make the recruitment, it
ig avggested that JENTORS could step in after the assonsment has
been coepleted.

6. Roxico andy ae Ce traces and coumenta are
requested, particular ron Copenhagen if NESTEGG's decision
Bot to recruit Identity’s superior (COPB 3101 (2830688) 16 July 63)
tas any bearing om the proposal im the dispatch.
