NICOLE SZULC

4. We would be grateful for ‘traces ‘on ‘Nicole S2ULC, American bk fo

freelence journalist, age 27/29. She apparently also works for ¢en .

a ch carries out. research into American security and .,ishaal &
gtuddc

group w ALT eri

elligence Operations. Her father was New York Times Bureau
Uhief in HAVANA in 1959..SZULC is a strong sympathiser of the
Cuban regine: by her own account she has come to Cuba for one
month at Cuban invitation to gather material on CIA operations

in Cuba, past and present, and to "assist" the Cubans in uncovering
new leads to current CIA intelligence activity (particularly among
- the foreign community). She. was last in Cuba in 1971, SZULC made

her first approach to the Cuban Embassy.in MEXICO CITY several
months ago-with a request for Cuban material on CIA operations.
The Cubans responded by inviting her to a cleahdestine-type meeting
in NEW YORK where she met Cuban ‘officials accredited to the UN in
acar. At that meeting no material was provided but she was asked
to come to Cuba as soon as possible’in order to carry out "joint
research". SZULC spent.the month of October in Brazil.where she
has family (she “is half Brazilian)’ and arrived in HAVANA ona
flight from LIMA on 9 November. She had appointments with MINREX
on 13 November to discuss her "programme" for the next four weeks. ~

2...° I met S2UIC first on 12 November at REGIN's (Reuter) .
appartment where. she. called to see him while I was paying him a
brief, unheralded call. ‘I met her again‘by chance on 13 November

in the lobby of the Riviera Hotel where she and British businessmen

whon I was visiting are staying. .The sympathetic. curiosity. shown
by REGIN and me ‘on the respective occasions was sufficient to get

her talking about the purpose of her visit. At the same time RUGIN _

and I both made favourable comments on certain aspects of Cuban
development and this seemed. to win her confidence. Her evident.

capacity for self-delusion appears to enable her to suppose that

other observers of the Cuban scene (except those possibly working
for the CIA whom'she hopes to uncover) share her partiality towards

the Cuban system. I did not, of course, disillusion her in my case,

and, although challenging some of her more outrageous remarks,
left her with the impression’ of a favourable view of Cuba. She is,
however, self-opinionated, intellectually obstinate and quite _
incapable of objectivity when discussing Cuba. She seems keen’ for
a further meeting (no doubt as a stepping stone to the foreign:
community she wishes to penetrate) and I ‘suspect is prepared to!
use her feminine charms along the way.

3e Apart from traces I should welcome your comments. Since she

will presumably be meeting DSE and DGI officials I would obviously -

have to be circumspect about any further encounter with her, but
you may consider this a good ovportunity to: try and pick up }
whatever details she may reveal unguardedly about: Cuban counter-
intelligence operations.
