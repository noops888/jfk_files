The Cubans responded by inviting her to a clandestine-type meeting

I met SZUIC first on 12 Novenber at REGI's (Reuter)

appartment where she called to see him while I was paying him a

brief, unheralded call.

I met her again by chance on 13 Hovember

in the lobby of the Riviera Hotel where she and British businessmen

whon I was visiting are staying.

The sympathetic curiosity shown

by REGIN and me on the respective occasions was suficient to get

her talking about the purpose of her visit.: At the same time REGIN

and I both made favourable comments on certain aspects of Cuban

development and this seemed to win her confidence.

other observars of the Cuban scene (except those possibly working

for the cIA whom she hopes to uncover) share her partiality towards

She seems keen for

Apart fron traces I should welcone your comments.

Since she

will presumably be meeting DSE and DGI officials I would obviously

have to be circumspect about any further encounter with her, but

you may consider this a good opportunity to try and pick up

whatever details she nay reveal unguardedly about Cuban counter-, phil Açee
