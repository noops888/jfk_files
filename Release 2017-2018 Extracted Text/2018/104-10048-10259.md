MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT; Frank Anthony STURGIS | i

1. This morning I received a phone call
from the (COS, who advised me that yesterday
Frank Sturgis id the DCD, Miami Office, and
expressed a desire to meet with one of the DCD
officers. Sturgis claimed to have new information
on the movement of narcotics through Mexico and
other information which he did not specify.

The DCD Miami Office thanked Sturgis for
calling and referred him to the FBI.and DEA,
who would be the most interested recipients of
e the information he has. Sturgis was very pleasant
on the telephone and the DCD people obviously
responded correctly.
