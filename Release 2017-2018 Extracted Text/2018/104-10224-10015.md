SECRET,

SUMMARY OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT

JAMES W. MCCORD, JR.

Service with the Central Intelligence Agency began on 22
August 1951 and continued through 31 August 1970, During his
career there was a variety of assignments involving investigations,
research and report writing, technical and physical security programs
and a two year tour overseas,

As an investigator during the first two yeare of employment,
there was wide involvement in a variety of support activities requiring
initiative and ingenuity.

During the seven years engaged in research and report writing,
there was much independence of action and success depended on
initiative, imagination and resourcefulness in pioneering mew areas
of interest. Beginning in May 1957, managerial responsibilities
began with appointment to a Deputy Chief position ofa research staff
of some six professional and clerical personnel.

When serving overseas, responsibilities were managerial in
nature as Chief of a regional staff of some ten professional and
Uerical personnel providing a full spectrum of security support

From August 1964 to June 1965 he attended the Air War
College as representative of the Agency.

Since 1965 two vital line positions were held involving the
‘Agency's programs in the technical and physical security fields.

In heading up the techaical security division, from 1965 to
1968, he had primary supervisory responsibility fur some 40
professional and clerical personnel, preparing the budget and pro-
grams for the Agency's technical security program, and managing
the obligating of authorized funding to assure that approved programs
and goals were met. He was jnstrumental in guiding the development
of new approaches, in establishing new training concepts and in
bringing the Agency to 4 position of recognized leadership in this
field.



Since October 1968, as Chief of a division responsible for
the Agency's physical security program he had primary responsibility
for the supervicion of some 70 professional and clerical personnel,
together with the programming, budgeting and implementing of the
total physical security program of the Agency. As a result of his
technological experience, he developed and implemented physical
security programs which produced for the Agency @ physical security
posture of pre-eminent quality within the US Government.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr, James W. MeCord, Jr.
‘THROUGH : Head of @@ Career Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service, If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation ‘n the system, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. Wowever, If the Head of the Carcer Service aivises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, 1 have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-
tem may be designated participants 28 soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised mo that
you do not meet the requirements of NR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and i have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. from a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 years
of service with the agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months
of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that. you
are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current
status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude recon-
sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should
meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CiA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of WR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

it is always possible that the records uron which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your ectual
employ history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officiais of your Career Servi They are
ase and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to d
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 62-1319 Head=
quarters (extension 6001). I£ such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of

the date of this menorandum, Nie
