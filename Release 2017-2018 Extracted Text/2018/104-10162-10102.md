after his exfiltration, was dated 25 October.) He later corrected this.

Names and biographic data on subject's parents
were submitted to the Bureau fo. tracing in
their files. The Bureau reported that these
individuals were not identified in Bureau files.

Green Lists on Subject's parents were submitted
to FI/D. Results were negative.

An attempt was nade to procure copies of the news-
paper (Hoy, 1939) which might have carried the
otory of Subject's iather's expulsion from the
Party. It was determined that no Cuban newspapers
are kept on file in the Agency. (Library Acquisi-

was made to procure the papers fron another Agency
or from the Library of Congress.

As indicated above, back issues of Cuban newspapers

fore imposeible to check Subject's story about the
meeting against news stories in contemporary iasces
of Revolucion, which he said was given e news relesse
on the second day of the nesting.

A review of FBID Daily Summaries for October 1959 ues
requested of FBID for the purpose of unearthing any
overt broadcast reporting on the meeting. FSID,
Latin americau branch, Mr. iodney Leving, acvised
that it was not possible for that office to conduct
such @ review at this tine. These sumaries“are
available for review at 1717 H Street, and will be
screened if the tine and effort involved are con-
sidered wortinhile.

“SH/L/PI (Barbara Zdvunds) advised that no reporting
on this October Liz\ meeting had been received other
than that from ARiDS,

It is noted that Saturdays and Sundays in October 1959
fell on 3b, 10-11, 17-18, and 2-25 Oeteber, and 31
October - 1 Wverber. Therefore at least one of

Results of this review of Subject's file do not support the
allegations made by DIAZ Lanz. Although the two major areas of doubt
resin somewhat unresolved, the weight of eridence would seen to be
in the Subject's favor.

4.

Agency and Bureau files contain no identifiable reeerd
of Subject's father.

AXTDG® himself volunteered inforration concerning beth
the cited areas open to possible question. ihe Subject
hed every reacon to believe that the information he
volunteared (i.e, that. hia father's @eminion from the
Party was reported in Roy, and that the [HAA meeting
was covered by a reporter from cevolucion) could be
easily verified.) —

The record of AXTDS's polygraph examination stated
that strong polygraph evidence had been obtained that’
Subject was a bong fide anti-Caatro and anti—oneamist
defector; that Iii had held a reeting around the
middle of October at which dubject was prerent; aad
that the letter of resignation addressed to Fidel was
written by hin and that it was cenerally accurate in
reporting the INA mosting.

There has been no evidence in FI‘) that ANTIHE is
other than what he clains to be.

S. Comment.

Dave Morales, JMWAVE/SI, has additionally commented that there

4s no love lost between AXTIMS and DIAZ Lans and that the latter's
allegations against; the forner are probably false. In view of 22

Lana’ feelings against ARTINE, it is not unlixely that he is endeavor-
