SUBJECT: Reis] GOYZALEZ Vonzales -/comments on Interview

in May 1979 in Miami. ff

‘
cit Veulg This Subject was interviewed on the occasionof both our
visits to Miami and we spent at least some 6 hours with him and j
still haven't finished. He totd us on the occasion of the last |
visit that he still wants to tell us about some things going
son in the Cuban exile communisty in Miami, that some Cubans are f
. -buying arms and planning actions against CASTRO, etc. He wants to
tell us, he said, thal ‘we’ll know and won't be surprised but he
denies all part for himself in any such illegal actions. He does
not believe it possible, given internal and external conditions
now prevailing, to overthrow CASTRO anytime soon but says if it 7
were possible, he would be the first to start preparations for
that purpose. When we next go to Miami we will listen to what
additional he has to says

2. Subject was for the writer the most interesting and perhaps

the most oroductive of the peonle we were assigned to interviews, t
This guy is cut from a different mold from the other 7. He is
gtough, intelligent, cunning, shrewd , lacking in formal education,
but a real toughin-fighter who knows what he wants and knows how
to go about it. He is, too, I think, a real opportunist, and this
wn - may explain in part his reason for putting on the 6 Nov 61 TV-
'SLSTIPEND program. I had the fe@ling repeatedly that he was not really

and ALVAREZ had been on opposite ends politically in previous
years, when ALVAREZ was working at the Chase Manhattan Bank in
Havana and representing the bank workers union, but they had
put aside their differences to work together against BATISTA»
Then, when CASTRO came along he propelled ALVAREZ to the post in
the CTC to which Subject had democratically been chosene The
imposition of CASTRO'S slate took place at a CTC congress in Nov
1960, He claims that he has never seen ALVAREZ since the business
of turning over his files to ALVAREZ was done in 1960, He knows
of course that ALVAREZ went on to other jobs, eventually to the
Cuban Embassy in Madrid, and eventually defected to the US. He

5. So far as he’s awa re there was only one obith bio BARROSO 8:
the one you're talking about iis the same one known to him, the
game one shot in late 1961 or early 1962, he's not eertain exact];
when, He claims that PUJAL and BARROSO were captured at the same j
tiwe or at about the same tine, othat it sight have been
PUJAL who reported to G-2 on E“but in any ease he(>ubject) didn't
do it. There were others in jail at that time, also, he says, who
could have told G-2 about BARROSO's revolutionary activities. As
stated, that question, as did the one on the TV program, visibly
rupset him so I'm not at all sure that we got the truth.

6. Subject was arrested on 11 October 1961 in a raid oa the
Cesar Odio Farm, along with a number of F peoples On 30 Septmber
1961 a woman belonging to his unit, Dalits RGE, was arrested, t
allegedly placing a bomb in a comoany there in Havana called CIAe,
Subject was carrying documentation in alias but almost immediately
he was confronted with Dalia who identified him to 4-2, But, the i
most irportant evddence is the fact that over the next few days |
and weeks those known to Dalia in that organization were arresteds
those not known to her were not, Although alledgedly arrested 7
planting a bomb, she was almost: immediately released and was econ
walking the street. A few months later Dalig. had married a lieutenant

that anyone captured would not talk for 72 hours, to give those
still free time to change hidding places, etc, then one would be
permitted, if forced to, to tell minor things, things it was
thzought the G-2 might already know, .

He was taken to a place referred to as POINT X and stripped
naked, He was interrogated almost continuously, Lights were kept
on and all sorts of threats were made against him. He could hear
in the building the vSices of others jpyem to him in the MRP,
among others Fernandb Rojas, Fernan Rivera, (now-in Caracas), fa Bey
RobertG' Jimenez. “is interrogators were Isidaro IEKCA, how ei L4 Fi 4 /

* Minister of Foreign Xelations, but then just a secretary to the -
nistry of Interior. MALMIERCA was assisted at times by Lt.
“ALFONSO (fnu), apparently an assistant to MALMIERCA, who was much
wore intelligent and much better trained than MALMIERCA, The
latter did a poor job and got little out of Subject but ALFONSO }
did a much better job .

‘After several days he was told that CASTRO himself would visit
thim and: personally conduct the interrogatién., He claims that he
told MALMIERCA that that would do no good for it was CASTRO himself
he helped to teach Subject many years before how to fight the
Commies and prevent their penetration into the labo: coe
As a result, he says, CASTRO did not come put; Ramtrd JALDEZ Wid,

VALDEZ told him that the decision had already been made not j
to shoot him ( Subject) but that some or most of the military
section people of his organization (MRP) in jail wouldhave to
pay with their lives for what they, Subject and others of the
MRP had done. The only way he could save them, VALDEZ said, would
be to go on TV and tell the nation what his organization had been
doing, tell them how useless resistance to CASTZO was, and at the
same time condem the US for its complicity in anti-CASTRO efforts.

Now, Subject claims that some of this fitted after a fashicn into
his own thinking and size up of the s&ate of things. He claias that
1) he had decided sone time earlier that internat resistance of the
sort the MRP was donducting was useless, and 2) that it would be
better to leave the country and fight from abroad, and 3) that he
had proposed just such a zove at a large meeting of MRP leaders
held just a few days before his capture. However, the student and
workers" representatives at that meeting did not support such a
move So no action was taken, then came his own arrests

An attemnt was to have been made on CASTROts life, using a
bazooka from a room overlooking a public plaga where CASTRO was
to appear on 4 October 1961, and VALDEZ had found out about these
plans, through Dalia, Subject assumes, Anyway, Subject clains
that three people were to have gone up to the room, which had been
preperly prepared and an escape route worksdvout , just prior to
the ceremony, Of the three, one guy, Antoni ‘VALADE! ciana got
fcold feet and took off for the States instead, Radi'VENTA Wel)
Mazo was there but did not fire the weapon, for some reason not
known to Subject, and the third man, whose game he could not
remember, ap>arently did not go up to the room either.

CONFIDENTIAL .

Well, believing that such resistance activities were in
fact futile and believing that CASTRO would in fact shoot
his men, and believing that he could all alone determine
what was to be said on TV, he decided that to accept the offer
was the correct thing to do. He could not have the blood of
others on his hand, he said, untéss something very worthwhile
was being accomplished. He professed to VALDEZ, however, that he
had no authority all by himself to make that decision and asked
to discuss it with three or four MRP leaders there in jail with
him. VALDEZ agreed that he could discuss it withF@ernando ROJAS
but with no one else, and that was done. ROJAS reluctantly

approved.

He wrote the presentation he was to give on TV and he siad
no substantive changes were made by the Cubans. He constructed
it, he saiJ, to 1) tell them as much as possible what they
wanted tohear without doing any real harm, 2) protect those |
still at large, and 3) give away as little senstitive information
as possible, He said he realized fully what he was doing, that
he would do it acain if caught in the same situation, and that
he takes full responsibility now as then for what he did and
said and still feels it was the only logical think he could
do. Again, this was not a subject he enjoyed discussing; he appear
ed in fact a bit embarassed by it all, but he knew it would be i
coming at some point.

8, Why didn't the Cubans release him after the ransom was pajd
‘them? Because he would not sign a paper in effect saying was
sorry and asking CASTRO'S forgiveness. He meet with Alo! 5 JJOL:
and three G-2 military officers to discuss the relea se and the
conditéons of the release one day after the ransom had been paid,
and when he refused the G-2's conditions PUJOL took a piece of
paper out and scribbled on it an agreement, which said Subject
would cbligate himself not to become involved again in antic ‘
CASTRO activities if released, and he agreed to sign that. In |
fact, he did sign it. PUJOL then handed it to the military officess
but they said the Cuban Vovt could not accept it. It was after
that that the money was reutrneds

a of Subject, A: 0 Muller,| Lino Pérnandaz, Antonio
ado, Migxfal Garcia ‘Arnengol, met with a representative of

the Ministry of the Interior, Lieutenant Mariano Rodriguez and
the Guanajay Director, Lieutenant Cosne. The Purpose was to
work out a work~rehabilitation plan without political indoc-
trination. ‘They had three forral and several informal
meetings while visiting proposed work sites for schools,

pig farms, etc. The Procressive Plan from the Ministry of

the Interfor came in February 1979 as a result of these dis-
cussions, The plan was essentially that proposed by the
prisoners, but the GOC added a proviso to “attend discussions

of political matters,” About 100 orisoners agreed, others

refused, The Ministry people explained it would consist only ~~ -

of listening to GOC officials reading Marxist pamphlets. ‘The
prisoners still refused. The Ministry finally struck that
point and published the plan, without reference to political
patters. The work-rehabilitation program then began about
late 1970 or early 1971.

In 1970, a Soviet General, advisor to the Ministry of

the Interior, made an inspection of Guanatay, with 8 or 10

other Soviets. Their escort was a IstLt, now a Major (name

again went hack to Guanajay.

went to Cuba to ask Pidel Castro to release Subject. On the
way from the airport in his car, Mercedes told Fidel she had

Fidel said that was no problem, that he would do it. The.

Peisoner Release Neantiations

12Dec77, on the plane from Nabana to Madrid, Carlos
Rafael Rodriguez told Subject he had a generally favorable
attitude toward the release of political prisoners; he thought
the GOC was ready to discuss it and mayhe something could be
worked out. Subject talked to Gabriel about the prospects on
the plane and later in Spain. then Subject got to the U.S.,
he wrote letters about prisoner release to friends in Venezu~
ela in COPZI. This went on through May, June, and into July
1978, Through Gabriel Garcia in Mexico, Subject sent a message
to Sergio Del Valle, Minister of the Interior, saying Subject:
wanted to talk to somebody outside Cuba about prisoner release.
The Pao was that the GOC was ready, and Subject could come
to Cuba in July 1978. Subject refused to go back to Cuba at
that time, and suggested Kingston. The GOC accepted.

Prior to this tine, a "Mr. Fisher* fron the Agency had
come to Miami to talk with Subject, who now sent a letter to
"Sr. Pescador" via the P.O. Box of Catherine Hardy in Washing-
ton. Subject tried to indicate what he was up to and hoped to
get somebody down to Miami to talk with, so Subject Could

Tha GOC representatives made the following pointss

some others to be added.

(2) They wanted more prisoners ineluded, not so few,
(3) They wanted a campaign to convince the U.S..to inprove

(4) They wanted the U.S. blockade dropped.
(5) They wanted to stop violent action against Cuba by refugees.
(6) They wanted pressure groups of refugees going to Washington

to influence the USG along the lines above.
Subject said he had no control over any of those things,

that he had gone on a personal, humanitarian nission but the

GOC wanted to raise the talks to a higher, more political |

level, and apparently wanted them in Habana. The GOC repre-

sentatives asked Subject to suggest some names for a priscner

The entire Cuban delegation, about 15 officials, was there,

bot only 3 or 4 wives, ‘There was an orchestra with violins.
Col, Manyo had gone to the market to buy spray deodorant for
himself and gifts for the children of Subject and bis wife.
On Monday, Subject and his wife returned to Miami.

Several weeks later, Subject received a nessage, thoough
a phone call from Gabriel Garcia and another call from
Carbonell in Kingston, that the first prisoners would come
out in September 1978 (they actually came in October), and
that some of the people on his list, particularly De Rojas

Benes had already accepted Fspinoza, Subject still refused.
Benes called Carbonell in Jamaica, who tried to talk Subject
into going. Subject was adamant. Carbonell said he would
check with Fabana, About 2 hourslater, Carbonell called
Benes at Padron's house and said they could drop Espinoza, _
but to be sure and send Subject. (To Sudject,this is more
evidence that Espinoza is a controlled agent and the GOC can
afford to sacrifice hin if necessary.)

Betancourt mat the Oct78 flight, along with other coc
officials, and the group was treated as though they were
diplomats. The next day, a massage cane to the guest house
that Pidel Castro wanted to see then. He came and ret with
the group alone, There was nobody else from the GOC and no

apparent taping or other records kept. They talked about 2 hours

op prisoner release. Then reporters cane in, including George
Volsky of REPLICA and the NEW YORK TIMES, Helga ‘Silva and
Bonnie Ahderson of the MIAMI HERALD. (Anderson's father had
been shot in Cuba by Castro and she wanted to visit his

tomb, On the third trip, whe was allowed to do so.)

In the 2 hour meeting, Pidel and the 5 people on the
committee agreed on ground rules. In an exchange with Pidel,
Subject made the point that, in this situation, everybody at
the table would be winners if it worked, but all would be
losers if it failed. Pidel would gain in international
stature, while the cornittee wovld gain the prisoners
release and make a start toward reunification of the Cuban
family. The others in his group were a little shocked and

afraid at Subject's frank statement, but Pidel agreed with hin,
When Fidel cama in, Benes took him around making introduce

tions. When they came to Subject, Fidel said, “Yes, we are

old friends.* At a coffee break, Msgr. Bosquet was the only

one to hear the following exchange. Pidel told Subject that

he would have been released much sooner except that many people

4n tha GOC opposed it because Subject had burned the El Encanto

Department Store on 16 April 1961. Pidel said Subject had done
it as a preliminary “to the invasion that he knew was coming

‘the next day. Subject reolied that he had not done it, - and

had known nothing about the invasion ‘any more than was known
on the street at the time,

The most substantive matters were about prisoner release,
the Cuban community in Miami, and about anti~Castro terrorist
activities, Pidel said that if there were no further such
acts, it would be a sign that the USG had taken proper control
measures, but if terrorism breaks out again, it would mean the

USG had allowed it to happen.

Current Personal Situation

Subject want from Habana to Spain in Dec77, and to
Miami in Jan7@. Yor about 3 months, he worked as an account-
ant in a clothing factory, then he switched to the VIASA
