and ALVAREZ had been on opposite ends politically in previous

years, when ALVAREZ was working at the Chase Manhattan Bank in

Then, when CASTRO came along he propelled ALVAREZ to the post in

the CTC to which Subject had denocratically been chosen. Ihe

imposition of CASTRO's slate took place at a CTC congress in Nov

1960. He claims that he has never seen ALVAREZ since the business

of turning over his files to ALVAREZ was done in 1960. He knows

pay with their lives for what they,

Subject and others of the

MRP had done. The only way he could save them, VALDEZ said, would

be to go on IV and tell the nation what his organization had been

doing, tell them how useless resistance to CASIRO was, and al the

same time condem the US for its complicity in anti-CASTRO efforts.

Now, subject claims that some of this fitted after a fashion into

1) he had decided sone time earlier that internal resistance of the

sort the MRP was dorducting was useless, and 2) that it would be

had proposed just such a nove at a large meeting of MRP leaders

held just a few days before his capture. However, the student and

representatives at that meeting did not

move so no action was taken, then came his own arrest.

to Sergio Del Valle, Minister of the Interior, saying Subject

wanted to talk to inmebody outside Cuba about prisoner release.

to Cuba in July 1978. Subject refused to go bach to Cuba at

that time, and suggested Ringston. The GOC accepted.

Prior to this tine, a "Mr. Fisher" fron the Agency had

The GOe representatives made the following points:

(1) They didn't want sone of the names included, but did want

some others to be added.

(2) They wanted more prisoners included, not so few.

(3) They wanted a campaign to convince the U.s.. to improve

relations.

(4) They wanted the U.S. blockade dropped.

(5) They wanted to stop violent action against Cuba by refugees.

(6) They wanted pressure groups of refugess going to Washington

to Influence the USG along the lines above.

Subject said he had no control over any of those things,

that he had gone on a personal, humanitarian sission but the

GOC wanted to raise the talks to a higher, more political

level, and apparently wanted them in Habana. The COC refre

asked Subject to suggest some names for a prisener

Col. Manyo had gone to the market to buy spray deodorant for

Several wecks later, Subject received a nessage, though

a phone call from Gabriel Garcia and another call fron

Carbonell in Ringston, that the first prisoners would coms

out in September 1978 (they actually came in October), and

that some of the people on his list, particularly De Rojas

Benes at Padron'a house and said they could drop Espinoza..

stature, while the cornittre would gain the prisoners"

had known nothing ahout the invasion 'any more than was known

The most substantive matters were about prisoner rclease,

the Cuban cormunity In Miami, and about anti-Castro terrorist

activities. Piel said that if there wore no further such

acts, It would be a sign that the USG had taken proper control

measures, but if terrorism breaks out again, it would mean the

USG had allowed it to happen.
