He indicated that subject had traveled _ from Mex: to Europe

via Canada on the KLM Airlines. Mr. vised that
subject is staying at the Hotel Emperatriz in Madrid. a

On 4-4-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA advised that one of

a his sources had reported to him that subject had been seen
at the Bodegon Restaurant in Madrid on 43-61 in the company
of JORGE ANTONIO. From this it would appear that subject's |

presence in Madrid is definitely known to the Cuban exiles. 4)
On 4-10-61 Mr. vised that for the moment

subject is being given protection by two members of the Directorate
General of Security (DGS) in Madrid. He said that he had re-
ceived information on that date that the DGS was planning to

use a pretext in an effort to debrief the subject. ¥

On 4-11-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA and JOSE M. CABEZON, {
who heads the delegation in Spain of the FRD, called at the
Madrid Office and supplied the following information,

: Approximately. a month ago CABEZON, through a Spanish
-."newspaperman to whom he had given an interview concernin;
FAD activities in Spain, became acquainted with AUGUSTIN

va
‘ LI SSARRADAS.
SICILIA, and at that time CABEZON was told that although ‘
¢ PARRADAS..is ostensibly a newspaperman, he is actually a secret ,
agent for a Spanish Government organization, not otherwise fli.

under the caption AUGUSTIN PARRADAS SICILIA, aka; IS - CUBA
& SPAIN, PARRADAS apparently is employed in something of an
informant capacity with the Information Section of the Spanish
High General Staff.) CABEZON said that PARRADAS indicated an
interest in introducing, CABEZON to his superiors, but that
this was never done. u)

MANZARBEITIA advised that he had been approached by !
an Inspector PRADAS of the Directorate General of Security in i
Madrid, with which individual they maintain contact as repre- ieeeeeezeeeel
sentatives of the FRD here, to arrange an interview with the
subject for the purpose of obtaining any information which the : |
subject might be willing to volunteer. MANZARBEITIA pointed . |
out that Inspector PRADAS is in charge of the investigation
of Cuban matters in Madrid and is most helpful to them; i
accordingly he agreed to talk to PARDO LLADA and through soacx/¥)(U) |

MANZARBEITIA said that they expected to be furnished a copy .
of the questions and answers on 4-12-61, and that they would
furnish a copy of the same to the Madrid Office thereafter. ee u)

On 4-11-61 MANZARBEITIA and CABEZON made available
a copy of the first report of PARRADAS, which he had supplied
to them. The contents of this report have been incorporated
into a letterhead memorandum, 12 copies of which are furnished
‘ for the Bureau together with 12 copies of an evaluation
memorandum. The confidential source abroad mentioned in the
letterhead memorandum is MANZARBEITIA, and the memorandum has
peen classified. confidential since both MANZARBEITIA and
CABEZON are furnishing information of Buregu interest on a
continuing basis to the Madrid Office. A a) fe 7

of 4-11-61. This is a resort area (6 u)

> From the above it appears rather obvious that the
interview of subject on 4-10-61 by MANZARBEITIA and GABINO
DELGADO had been the pretext interview mentioned above by

Inasmuch as this is primari matter coming within
CIA jurisdiction and inasmuch as Mr. lhad been keeping §)
the Madrid Office currently advised of all his activities in

an effort to debrief the subject, on 4-11-61 he was furnished
orally with full information concerning all the interviews of
the subject that were going on and the apparent conflict of
interest between the Directorate General of Security on the
one hand and the High General Staff, represented by PARRADAS,
on the other hand. At the same time he was furnished with a
copy of the report prepared by PARRADAS which contained the re-.
sults of his interview of the subject on 4-7-61. “ty becuse)

all the measures adopted by the CASTRO government. He

ae 7 tries to justify the system and made various allusions

to the la of capacity of persons in responsible
positions Cuba and placed the biame on them for

the preser haotic situation in Cuba. He does not
describe % CASTRO nor the members of his government

as Commu: s although he recognizes that all of them
are ‘'dominsted and under the control of members ‘of. the
Communist Party. He claimed that REGINO BOTI, Minister

of Economy, RAUL CEPERO BONILLA, Director of the National
Bank and ex-liinister of Commerce, and LUIS BUCH, Minister
of the Presidency, are all anti-Communists. u)

He said that.all the sugar mills will be
dynamited once an attack against Cuba is started. The

same will happen to the princi tustries and centers

of production on the Island. “)

him the truth inasmuch as both PERON and JORGE ANTONIO ~
-were completely ignorant about everything concerning Hl
his journey. This latter would appear doubtful inasmuch
as JORGE ANTONIO went to the airport to meet the subject,
and it is obvious that this latter and his people tried

to cover up the arrival.in Madrid of the subject. It was
evident that the subject has a good, ol endship with

. i General PERON, whom he always defended PU)

From infor on obtained fror oo it
-would appear that with regard to the aid which the govern-
CASTRO gives to Spani Communists, perhaps the
ortant is that of furnishing Cuban passports to
those who lack doc tation, The subject considers that
an invasion of C li be a cailure, insisting that

six or seven thoisand men can do nothing because there
are SO many peopie who are Still with CASTRO. Subject
thinks it would be ssary to wait more time,to let

the matter mature, at an internal uprising would be
