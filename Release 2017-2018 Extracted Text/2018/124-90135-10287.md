a severe physical beating to him. MANZARBEITIA said' that he

MANZARBEITIA pointed out that the subject is a close friend of

wealthy Argentine named JORGE ANTONIO, who resides in Madrid

and who is a close associate of ex-President JUAN PERON Of

Argentina,

MANZARBEITIA said he is personally

friendly with ANTONIO and thought he could learn from him when

He indicated that subject had traveled Irom Mexze9

to Europe

via Canada on the KLM Airlines.

Mr.

aevised that

subject is staying at the Hotel

Emperatriz in Madrid.

On 4-4-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA advised that one of

his sources had reported to him that subject had been seen

at the Bodegon Restaurant in Madrid on 4-3-61 in the company

of JORGE ANTONIO.

From this it would appear that subject's

presence in Madrid is definitely known to the Cuban exiles.

On 4-10-61 Mr.

advised that for the moment

subject is being given protection by two members of the Directorate.

General of Security (DGS) in Madrid.

He said that he had re

ceived information on that date that the DGS was planning to

use a pretext in an effort to debrief the subject. (

On 4-11-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA and JOSE M. CABEZON,

who heads the delegation in Spain of the FRD, called at the

Madrid Office and supplied the following information.

Approximately a month ago CABEZON, through a Spanish

newspaperman to whom he had given an interview concerning

ERD activities in Spain, became acquainted with AUGUSTIMPARRADAS:

(SICILIA, and at that time CABIZON was told that although

PARRADAS is ostensibly a newspaperman, he is actually a secret

agent

for a

Spanish Government organization, not otherwise spa

identified.

(As has been previously reported to the Bureau

under the caption AUGUSTIN PARRADAS SICILIA, aka; IS - CUBA

& SPAIN, PARRADAS apparently is employed in something of an

informant capacity with the Information Section of the Spanish

High General Staff.) CABEZON said that PARRADAS indicated an

interest in introducing CABEZON to his superiors, but that

this was never done.

MANZARBEITIA advised that he had been approached by

an Inspector PRADAS of the Directorate General of Security in

Madrid, with which individual they maintain contact as repre-

sentatives of the FRD here, to arrange an interview with the

subject for the purpose of

obtaining any information which the

subject might be willing to volunteer. MANZARBEITIA pointed

out that Inspector PRADAS is in charge of the investigation

of Cuban matters in Madrid and is most helpful to them;

accordingly he agreed to talk to PARDO ilADa and through JONGE 30/U)

MANZARBEITIA said that they expected to be furnished a copy

of the questions and answers on 4-12-61, and that they would

furnish a copy of the same to the Madrid Office thereafter.

K(u)

On 4-11-61 MANZARBEITIA and CABEZON made available

a copy of the first report of PARRADAS, which he had supplied

to them.

The contents of this report have been incorporated

Into a letterhead memorandum, le copies of which are furnishec

for the Bureau together with 12 copies of an evaluatior

memorandum.

The confidential source abroad mentioned in the

letterhead memorandum is MANZARBEITIA, and the memorandum has

been classified confidential since both MANZARBEITIA and

CABEZON are furnishing information of Bureau interest on a

continuing basis to the Madrid Office.

MANZARBEITIA advised on 4-11-61

that the subject

had told him and DELGADO that he was planning to proceed to

* Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, on the afternoon

of 4-11-61. This

is a resort area.

Fron the above it appears rather obvious that the

interview of subject on 4-10-61 by MANZARBEITIA and GABINO

DELGADO had been the pretext interview mentioned above by

one hand and the High General Staff, represented by PARRADAS,

on the other hand. At the

are 'dominated and under the control of members of the

him the truth inasmuch as both PERON and JORGE ANTONIO

were completely ignorant about everything concerning

his journey.

This latter would appear doubtful inasmuch

as JORGE ANTONIO went to the airport to meet the subject,

and it is obvious that this latter and his people tried

to cover up the arrival in Madrid of the subject. It was

evident that the subject has a good, old

General PERON, whom he always defended.

From infornation obtained fron subject; it

would appear that with regard to the aid which the govern-

ment of CASTRO gives to Spanish Communists, perhaps the

most important is that of furnishing Cuban passports to

those who lack documentation.

The subject considers that

an invasion of Cuba will be a

rallure, insisting that

six or seven thousand men can do nothing because there

are so many people who are still with CASTRO. Subject

thinks it would be necessary to wait more time,to let

the matter mature, aot that an internal uprising would be

more successful.

Besides, if Cuba is attacked now, all

the Communist parties would

•t an unprecedented

campaign

of agitation and propaganda.
