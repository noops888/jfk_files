PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING APRIL. IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1. The Department of State has:

a. Participäted in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the 3-4 April Managua Meeting respecting discouragement of

travel of Latin Americans to Cuba for training in subversion.

The text of the resolution is appended hereto.

b. Headed an interdepartmental team currently visiting the

Isthmian capitals whith the objective of securing the fullest

and quickest Implementation of all the recommendations agreed

on at Managua. Prior to the departure of the team, Department

of State posts were instructed to inform the host governments

of the trip and to encourage them to identify the kinds and

extent of technical assistance it would be most useful for the

United States to furnish.

c. Caused to be noted in U.S. passports since I April

that they are not valid for travel to Cuba.

d. Following an Indication that the Bolivian Government

might be willing to increase efforts to impede travel of 1ts

nationals to Cuba, Instructed the U.S. Embassy to recommend

that the GOB:

1) Ban travel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except

for official or special purposes approved by the GOB;

and establlsh legal penalties for violations;

2) Require Bolivian citizens to have a passport or

other GOB document to travel abroad;

3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba unless

specially endorsed;

4) Seek arrangements with third countries which are

and will help identify violators.

5) Drawing on the recommendation in the paper on "The

Movement of Subversives and Subversive Trainees" and other

sources, Instructed the non-isthmian posts to encourage host

governments to take additional counter-subversion steps.

Each instruction was tailored to the local situation 1n

the

recipient country and Included appropriate suggestions

as to strategy which might be used in securing implementation

of the desired actions.

6) Requested posts in Latin America to encourage host

governments to take appropriate measures to discourage

participation of their nationals in Cuba's May Day cele-

bration and to prevent charter flights from their country

to Cuba for the celebration.

7) Through efforts with various Latin American and other

governments, discouraged participation in the Cuban solid-

arity Congress. U.S. efforts contributed to limiting the

success of the Congress from the Castro-Communist point of

view.

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued the US sea and air surveillance of the

area surrounding Cuba until 25 April 1963, at the same

rate and with the same emphasis as existed prior to that

date. Since 25 April 1963 additional sea surveillance

has been realized between Cuba and Haiti, due to the

stationing.of the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at

the entrance of the Gulf of Gonaives occasioned by the

deterioration of internal conditions within Halt.

Reports of

subversive movement, or suspected subversive

movement, obtained by US surveillance are avallable for

Immediate transmittal through the US military alerting

system.

b. Continued action, at high priority, on the Install-

ation of military. communications facilities in Latin America:

As of 1 April, a commercial submarine cable from Florida

to Panama became operational. This cable gives reliable

voice.and teletype communications to CINCARIB Including

both classified teletype and voice, Negotiations are

continuing in Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador for the

installation of military radio facilities.

Installation

of a multi-channel radio station has been completed in

Costa Rica. A similar facility in Nicaragua 1s scheduled

for completion by 1 July 1963.

c. Established an Intelligence Center at CARIBCOM Head-

quarters, In connection with the program of surface

surveillance of the Caribbean, for rapid processing and

dissemination to countries concerned, via the American

Ambassadors, of Intelligence on the movement of subversives..

Study of the establishment of intelligence centers in the

Caribbean revealed that the Intelligence Center should be

established at Caribbean Command Headquarters and that a

center need not be established at Headquarters, Caribbean

Sea Frontier.

d. Established on 1l April a U.S. military alerting

system operated by CINCARIB and CINCLANT. Pursuant to the

request of the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on

Cuban Affairs the Department of Defense has suspended the use

of the Military Groups in the alerting system and 1s working

with CIA to reduce duplication of effort to a minimum:

e. Alerted U.S. forces, for the most part within the

Atlantic Command, to be prepared to provide U.S. assistance

in the final interception of shipping in territorial waters

Currently, forces

are assigned by the unified commander Involved, to meet the

singular problem encountered. Preparations have been made

to respond to a possible requirement in the case of the

Venezuelan ship FERRYMAR III.

f. Ordered to the Canal Zone a Coast Guard Mobile

Training: Team for a period of six months, beginning

15 May 1963, to provide training, In Spanish, In boat

handling and maintenance together with surveillance

techniques to those Central American countries having 40

foot Coast Guard Utility Boats. In addition, the Mobile

Training Team will assist as required in establishing a

permanent Small Craft Training and Inspection Facility in

the Canal Zone. One 40 foot utility boat has been permanently

assigned to the U.S. Naval Station, Rodman, Canal Zone for

use by

the MIT and will be delivered there about 20 June.

3. The Central Intelligence Agency has:

a. Completed Its efforts to Improve U.S. government

communications in Latin America by the installation of

the remainingütwo commercial leased circuits into

Guatemala City and Managua, and the stationing on a

permanent basis of

CIA radio operators in Latin

America in replacement of temporary duty personnel.

In

November 1962, CIA's active radio facilities 1n

Latin

American capitals were augmented with on-line crypto-

graphic facilities and temporary personnel to handle the

bulk of all U.S. government communications in the area.

These facilities, known as Joint Communications Centers,

are now being operated by CIA on a 24-hour basis, as a

service to all U.S. government agencies. Latin American

ment of persons, arms and propaganda materials to and

from Cuba. A summary of actions by country 1s provided

below:

1) Argentina - Station, In conjunction with the

Embassy, has continued to press the Argentine govern-

ment to enact effective travel control legislation

and to adopt measures recommended by the Special

Security. Committee of the OAS: Information on

Argentines travelling to Cuba 1a being furnished to

the Argentine government by the station..

Several

potential travellers to Cuba have been spotted and

are being assessed by the station. Information from

three recent returnees from Cuba is being obtained

through debriefings. Station reports that because of

Increased Mexican controls, all truly clandestine

travel to Cuba from Argentina 1s now via Prague.

Che

Quevara's mother was arrested on 23 April upon her

return to Argentina for Importing Castro propaganda.

2) Bolivia - Station and Embassy have been urging

Bolivian government to adopt stricter travel controls,

without apparent results so far. Names of travellers

known

to have returned from Cuba are being furnished

to the Bolivian government. Thus far, no action 18

known to have been taken by the Bolivian government on

the strength of such information, Station comments that

problem with Bolivia is not in lack of Information

travellers to and from Cuba. Government is now requiring

passport applicants to state destination, and passports

must be turned in after travel.

The Foreign Minister

has stated much progress is being made, with cooperation

of the Mexican government, and that travel of Chileans to

Cuba has been dramatically reduced in recent weeks

government in this regard. Names of travellers to Cuba

charge d'affaires was subsequently recalled by his own

government.

his willingness to institute an improved travel control

system.. One station asset expects to travel to Cuba

In the near future. Station believes it has identified

a courier operating between Colombia and Cuba and has
