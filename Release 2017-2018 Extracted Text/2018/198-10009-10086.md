issued 10-15 visas during April on pieces of paper.

Separate from the Rassport, but the government's practice -

the stigma of travel to Cuba, All Cubans arriving in
Mexico, whether in transit or otherwise must have Mexican
visas. .This is not true of other nationalities, who need
no visa if in transit. The government continues to
confiscate propaganda material from Cuba sporadically at
