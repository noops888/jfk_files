MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: Bebriefing ef Edvard G. Tichbern(P)

1. Edward G.Tichborn(P) arrived in Washington from his. trip to Cubs: during
the night of 31 January 1960/. "e was debraefed at the Fotel Statler from about

1000 to 1530 hours on 1 February. Those prosent at,
[eames] and Charles Penney from W Division, Mr (eae ale
fe Undersigned. This debriefing vas very interesting and results a good

deal of pertinent information. The three ond « half reels of tape derived fuem
therefrom are now being transcribed by this office. Soxe of the more salient
points are noted below.

2. Some of the operational information and suggestions offered by Tichbern
are the following:

ay There appears to be little chance of a coalition ef the opposition
groups at this time or in the near future since they are not well organized
and each group’ xamt vould want to be the leader of such an effort. Alco,
according to the mmabers of the orposition to whom Tichborn talked, it is
the general consensus of opinion that Fidel Castro is in no danger of loosing
his grip or the devotion of his followarsx for sone time to come.

b. Fidel Castro seens to becone most xt upset and almost paniced by :
defections. Possessing a "Messiah-type complex" he cannot bear the thought
of someone leaving the fold. Rather than to let such defections pass on
unnoticed, he feels xompalled to give reasons and rake excuses. This then
blows he matter up perheps out of proportion and quickly becomes a matter
of public knowledge. Tichborn feels that the inducement of dedections ccald
perhaps have more effect on Castro then any other single, rational action ve
night undertake.

é. There appears to be a relatively long-standing schism between the
brothers Fidel and Raoul Castro. Raoul 1s the moze cold individual. As an
example, Fidel once ordered some ‘400 prisoners to be returned safely to their
hoges, but Racul had a number of then killed. The general feeling in Cuba is
hat Fidel is not a Communist, but that Raoul is undoubtedly at least a
fellov-traveller. Developing or exploiting this schism could therefore, be
operationally advantageous. (The fact that they are brothers would probably
huve little effect on Fidel vho as already reduced ktexmmk the land holdings
of his mother and another brother in conformity with the agrarian refor2
program and vho jailed his otster, and fired a Minister, over 2 shake-down
on an insurance deal.)

3, Of special operatioral interest were several individuals Tichborn
mentioned who might have some influence on Fidel Castro and hence might be of

operational interest. They are:

a. Pather(Padre) Alberto de Castro: he is a Jesuit priest presently
located in Caracas, Vehezuela, vho had been a teacher of Fidel Castro during
his youth. Castro was in Venezuela and saw Father de Castro there during

. which time the latter criticized Fidel for some of his actions. In spite of
oe the famt that this-remonstration occured in front of some of Fidel‘s men,
y and they leterthe latter treated him with great respect. It vas felt by Tichbern's source
chatted-alone of this information, and by Tighborn, that Father de Castro undoubted
for an hour. has sone-influence over Castro. Tichborn suggested that it would be of value to
‘determine whether or not Fidel has cny regular contact with Father de Castro
and.if so,what operational potential he might have.

b.. Herb Mathews! he is a journalist with the R.¥,Times and vas the only
American nevapaperman covering the Castro story prior to his final success.
While Tichborn was in Cuba, a front pege article pa appeared in Revolucion
(the regime's press-spokesman) on Mathews. It was a sort of editorial and
praised Mathews as @ "real man" and one who understocd the revolution and
its eins. Tichborn feels that it might be to our advantage to got into
contact with Mathews since he appears to have the confidence of the
administration. :

nd .
c. Professor;Roscot Subject is on the faculty of the Universidad de
Villanueva and is a contemporary of Fidel Castro. They were: clacsmates and
both were debators although according to Rosco, Castro did not make the
Debating. Society ‘of which’ he(Rosco) was the presidentOuce efter the
revolution, Rosco attended a_sppech Castro made and after the oration, the
e latter adked Rosco what he thought cf it. Upon hearing some criticism, hé wanted
to know how it could: have been inproved. Since Castro was leaving for
1 Venezuela ‘and the Jnited States he asked Rosco to accompany him in order that
they could discuss the matter further. Tichborn feels that Rosco (a somber of
the opposition) kmx probably has more influence on Castro thun Rosco realizes
and that this possibility would be worth looking into.

4, Edvard R.Marrowt he produced a-TV program on Castro and Tichborn feels
that he might have established @ rapport with Castro during this period.

4. One of the contacts Tichborn wade in Cuba (the Director of Tourism) asked
him 4f he knew of anyone who would be interested in coming to Cuba on an all-dxpenses-
paid visit in order to write articles (or other similar propaganda) on present day
Cuba. Tichborn mentioned Clete Koberta, a populer redic and TV commentator in Los
Angéles as a possible candidate. (Tichborn also discussed thie matter with Horace
W. Davis.) Tichborn will mention this possibility to Roberts upon hia return to
Californie.

5. While in Cuba, Tichborn accidently met a young lady who later revealed to
him that she war "an agent for the #State Departrent". He felt that this vas a

ity patter and that it should be brought to our attenticn for that purpose.

6. Cn the adninistrative side, #%, Tiebrorr will forward by pat his
financial accounting, one copy to the cover coupshy and the other to Henry
~W. Darkin(P), The cover letter which vas provided him thr the event that
he cane to the attention of the Cyban authcrities was returned to us and is
now in his Tile. (Thore was no necessity for its use.) Tichborn inquired as to
the possibility of receiving reimbursement for medical expenses vhich will
undoubtedly be incurred upon bis return to California due to a possible hernia
which developed in New York on hfs. return trip en route to Washington. This is
being checked out by this office. Tichborn departed fgrLos Angeles (having been

tenryte—berkin) at about 1800

hours on 1 February 1960.
