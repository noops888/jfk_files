MEMARANBUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJDCT: Debriefing of Edward G. Tichbara(P)

1. Edward G.Tichborn(P) arrived in Washington from his trip to Cuba during

the night of 31 Jamary 1960/, Fo was debriefod at the Hotel Statler from about

the Undersipned. This debriofing was very Interesting and resulted inn a good

deal of pertinent Infornation. The three and & half roels of tape derived tr

therefrom are now being transcribed by this cifica. Some of the more sallent

points are notod below.

2. Some of the operational Information and sugrostions offered by Tichborn

are the following:

a: There appoars to bo little chance of a coalition of the opposition

groups at this time or in the near future since they are not well organized

and each group mur would want to be the leader of such an effort. Aleo,

according to the mabers of the orposition to whon Tichborn talked, 1t 1s

the general consensus of opinion that Fidel Castro is In no danger of loosing

his grip or the devotion of his followerse for some time to come.

b. Fidol Castro seems to bocone most it upset and almost paniced by

defections. Possessing a "Messiah-type compler" he cannot bear the thought

of someone loaving the fold. Rather than to let such defections pass on

unnoticed, he feels corpilled to give reasons and rake excuses. This then

blows hhe

matter up perhaps out of proportion and quially becomes a matter

of public knowledge. Tichborn foels that the inducement of deractions coald

perhaps have more effect on Castro than any other single, rational action le

night undertake.

c. There appears to be a relativaly long standing schion between th

rothers Fidel and Faoul Castro. Raoul 19 the more cold individual. As a

cample, Fidel once ordered some 400 prisoners to be returned safely to thes

ut Racul had « number of them killes. The coneral feellne In Cuba 1

have little effoct on Fidel who has already reduced icture the land holdings

of hia mother and another brother in conformity with the agrarian refor

rogram and no Jailed hig sister, and fired a minister, over & shake dow

on an inow'ance daal.

3. Of special operatioral interest wore several Individuals Tichborn

mentioned who might havo sone Influence on Fidol Castro and hance mlebt ba of

operational lntereat.. They are:

a. Lather (Padro) Alberto de Castro: he 1s a Jesult priest presently

locatod In Caracas, Venezuela, who had been a teacher of Fidel Castro during

his youth. Castro was In Venezuel, and saw Father de Castro there during

which time the litter criticized Fidel for sone of his netlone. In spite of

tho fart that this remonstration occured in front of some of Fidel'e men,

ard they laterthe litter treated him with great respect. It was felt by Tichbern's source

chatted alone of this information, and by Tlnhborn, that Father de Castro undoubted

for an bour....

has some Influence over Castro, Tichborn surgested that 1t would be of value to

deternine whother or not Fidel has ony rogular contact with Father de Castro

.. Harb nathouss he is a journaliat with the W.Y, Ilnes and was the only

American newspaperman covering

the Castro story prior to his final success.

While Tichborn was in Vuba, a front pago article ye appeared in Revolucion

(tho regimo's press spokesman) on Mathews. It was a sort of editorial and

praised Mathews as a "real man" and one who understood the revolution and

Its eins. Tichborn fools that 1t might be to our advantage to got into

contact with Mathews since he appears to have the confidence of the

c. Professorilosco: Subject Is on the faculty of the Universidad de

Villanova and is a contemporary of Fidel Castro. They were cla-smates and

both were debators although according to Rosco, Castro did not make the

Debating: Society of which he(Rosco) was the presidentonce after the

revolution, Rosco attended a sppoch Castro made and after the oration, the

latter asked Rosco what he thought cf 1t. Upon hearing sone criticiam, he wanted

to know how it could have been inproved. Since Castro was leaving for

Venezuela and the United States he asked Rosco to accompany him in order that

they could discuss the natur further. Tichborn fools that Rosco (a nember of

the opposition) to probably has more influence on Castro than Rosco realises

and that this possibillty would be worth looking into.

d. Edward R-Hurrows he produced & I program on Castro and Tichborn feels

that he night have established a rapport with Castro during thia period.

L. One of the contacts Tichborn sade In Cuba (the Director of Tourism) arked

him If he knew of anyone who would be interested in coming to Cuba on an all expenses-

paid visit in ordor to vrite articles (or other similar propaganda) on present day

Cuba, Tichborn mentioned Clete Foberts, a popular radio and TV commentator in los

ngolos as a possible candidate. (Tichborn also discussed this matter with Horac

. Davls.) Ilchborn will mention this possibility to Roberts upon hia return t

Californic.

5. While in Cuba, Tichborn accidently net a young lady who Inter revealed to

him that she wa san agent for the §Stato Dapartment". He folt that this vas a

Division. The Incident and the detalla will be rade the subject of a separato

memorandun for GI Staff.
