LESS UNDER CONTROL--TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE. JOHNSON APPEARED ON
TELEVISION, HE EXPRESSED HIS ANGUISH AND HIS SORROW. HE MADE
INSPZRED COMMENTS ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING. THESE. ACTIONS AND. THESE
WORDS HIDE FEAR OVER THE WAVE OF JUST VIOLENCE WHICH 1S STARTING TO
SPREAD THROUGH THE UNITED STATES.‘'* yat A TIME WHEN COMPLEX INTEK-
NATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT ‘BE UNDERWAY, UNDER DIFFICULT CONDITIONS,
THIS NEW CRIME WIDENS THE CHASM WHICH-DIVIDES THE PEOPLE OF THE
UNITED STATES AND INCITES THE PEOPLE TO PROMOTE DISTURBANCES WHOSE
FAR-REACHING EFFECTS ARE HARD TO PREDICT.** SST HE ASSASSINATION OF
MARTIN LUTHER KING CONFIRMS THAT THE VIOLENCE OF IMPERIALIST RACISTS
TS ONLY ANSWERED EFFECTIVELY WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY
STRUGGLE.**

concern contacts of Subject who are believed to be of interest:

A. “Attachment A: A letter from‘CaW, the “~~
magazine of Students for a Democratic Society, signed
by Jerry *BODANES, thanks Margaret for Ter popes
which they are using. The magazine is scheduled to
be off the press around May 10. The letter. clearly
indicates that the SDS was behind the student seizure
of Columbia University. It says, "Right now our
glorious brothers have seized Columbia University~-

now named. M:

iversity--and over which an

N.L.F. flag now flies.

The others, faculty, deans,

managers,..are all scurrying and speaking pious--
saying SDS:this,-SDS that, ‘while we hold five
buildings in joyousness and the most serious
preparations to resist, our movement has over reached."
Enclosed is a check made out against the account of
the SDS in the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company,

signed by Robert M, *SHAPIRO,

with the editor-in-chief of AKZENTE to publish works

help in collecting then. BASTIAN says that he is
going to Berlin about 1 July, to Prague in early
autumn for a "group 47 meeting," and to Cuba in
early November.

C. Attachment C: Letter from Jaime *CARRERO,
Art Department of the Interamerican University in
San German, Puerto Rico. CARRERO has apparently sent
Margaret a series of drawings based on Dr. Martin
Luther KING's assassination. He describes them as
"poetic...but full with guts and disgust." He says
there is a possibility CBS will do a program on
his paintings and the work in his Art Department.
CARRERO is going to Columbia University in the

El Corno there.

: D. Attachment D: Letter from Susan *SUERMAN,

MINREX-Direccion de Organismos Internacionales,

E, Attachment E: Margaret got a letter from
someone associated with CATERPILLAR. He is thinking
of getting married to Marie *BENOIT in England this

“Pact that Wargaret“RANDALL received a letter from Moscow from
/\ Imis #SUaRDIAZ, whose return address was given as the Cuban
;? Embassy, Moscow, URSS, SUARDIAZ asks for Suzan SHERMAN

i (see paragraph ip above). SUARDIAZ says he will be working

3. In attachment G, Sergio MONDRAGON, Subject's husband,

I'm sending then in a separate. envelop Air-Mail.

‘The Hippia Book te really: great locking, thank you for it, - There
are two people in Cuba I think would be very interested in it

Af you could send the copies. One works on Fensimente Griticon-

dear Meg, re SS

Tam sorry to have put the Japanese filmmaker on you;
misjudgement. You-were right to send the thing back to me.
‘Some charges in my life have recently re-determined the
summer, and Lam doubtfal tonight, really doubtful for the
first tima (tho T have been thinking about this for a couple of
‘weeks, “but have not written because Everything was up in the
air}, about the trip this summer, The thing is that a more im- “
portant thing has come up, namely going to England this fail
to do some very important work in an applied philosophy called
Scientology (to go "clear as they call i), and doing that I. «
must teach all summer to make money and also to do work on ©
the fall issue of CATERPILLAR, Marie Henoit and Iare a;
serioualy considaring getting married in England, and while
I could put the trip off until next spring, she wants to do the
thing this fall, and.we both want to go clear together. So,
congidering all of this, I think you should scratch my name,
Andypope I can go to Cuba later as well as hope the Cubans!
will see fit to invite me later (have heard nothing from any
Cubans about the trip this summer, so I figured it is not com-
pletely sel). aro oe tet ee
cat. All ofthe other naznea T seat you are aithto'my
knowledge good\if I hear otherwise I will write you immediately. “A

CATERPILLAR 3/4 1a out, and 3 copies are on thelr way to you, egg bee

‘Iwill mait a box of #2 and mord'3/4s when I get the time. Sorry
noi to hv gent more, but only 3 went out to the contributors this
time and I forgot about you sending some to Cuba when I mailed
yours, ° > Faaeg

Saw Sergio a few weeks ago, It was nice to see him.
‘We had supper in Chinatown and I gave hia a new poem,

A number of people have commented on your prose/poem in
#3/4. Very impressive is the general word, Thope it looks good
to you when you see the magazine,
Thave a great deal new
‘work; are you open to printing more of my poetry in a forthcoming
EL CORNO?

Thope you are not upset my change fn plans. This
Sunday is the first day they have been definite, Hoping your

life goss well these days,
