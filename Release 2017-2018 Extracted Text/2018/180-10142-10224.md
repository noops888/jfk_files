Manuel Rày

Rivero was born in Cuba in 1924. (HSCA#009005

Memo to G. Robert Blakey, 6/28/78, Interview with Manolo Ray

Rivero from Fonzi/Gonzalas) Ray has been described as softspoken,

unassuming, almost humble -- a natural leader of the highest

intellect, sincerity and conviction. (CIA/DDO Manuel Ray Rivero

Volume II, Cable to Director from MASH, 11/17/60) In 1947, be-

cause of his outstanding performance as a civil engineer, he was

granted a scholarship by the Cuban Ministry of Public Works to

pursue graduate studies in engineering at the University of Utah.

(HSCA 006468, P. 9, Item 8, FBI Manolo Ray References, Section 2)

Ray was in the United States for two years but did not complete

his work for a masters degree. (Ibid)

During this

period, it has been alleged that Ray was

friendly with members

of the Puerto Rican group which plotted to

assassinate President Truman, (CIA/DDO Loose Document, Dispatch

and a good friend of Puerto

Rican Communist Redro Albi/zu Campos.

VIbid) It was further alleged

that he was in frequent contact with Puerto Ricans who were working

on the rennovation of the White House. (Ibia) The assassination

attempt of President/Truman occurred at Blair House, across the

street from the white House.

The Trumans were using this home as

an official residénce until such time as the White House renovation

was completed.

in 1949,

When Ray returned

to Cuba, he held

various positions in

the engineering field, one of which was project manager for the

53

construction of the Havana Hilton Hotel. (HSCA 006468, P. 9, Item

8, Manolo Ray References, FBI, Section 2)

In May 1957, he organized the Civic Resistance Moment

which supervised sabotage and acts of terrorism against the regime

of Cuban President Batista. (HSCA 009005 Memo to G. Robert Blakey,

6/28/78, Interview of Manolo Ray Rivero from Fonzi/Gonzales) Fidel

Castro appointed Ray Minister of Public Works in February 1959.

(Ibid

He confided to two anti-Castro Cubans in April 1959 that he recognized

the symptoms of Communism in the Castro regime but was not prepared

86

to conspire against "El Lider Maximo". (Give Us This Day, Popular

Library Edition, E. Howard Hunt, p. 91) Ray was relieved of his

official position in November 1959 (HSCA 005990, p. 2, "Ne

until he formed

the Revolutionary Movement of the People (MRP)

arfound May 1960 (HSCA #009005 - Interview)

The MRP was an anti-Castro organization which believed

that the ideas and aims of the democratic left best suited the

needs and aspirations of the Cuban people. (CIA/DDO, Ray Vol VI,

9 June 1962 study of program for liberation of Cuba submitted by

Ray) The MRP did not wish to reinstate the 1940 Cuban Constitution

No definite reason for this severence has been documented

but,

according to one source, Ray did not leave Castro because of

ideological or policy discrepancies but rather because of a

personality clash with Castro's Minister of Labor, who almost

shot Ray after a Cabinet meeting! (CIA/DDO Ray Vol VII, Memo from

Jack Malone, former manager, Kings Ranch, Cubal, dated July 16,

1962) Another theory which came to the attention of the CIA was

that Ray resigned because of his opposition tone plan to shoot

cuban revolutionary hero, Hubert Matos, as a traitor: Teta/aDo,

(Ibid p. 92) and charges of "Fidelism without Fidel" were

made against him and the MRP bacause of their leftist ideologies.

withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs

invasion. In

a Miami new conference on May 28, 1961, he said

the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the

council had

failed to live up to the written promises given

it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before

1 gt40

joining the organization. (NYTimes, 5/28/61, One Cuban Group

Quits Exile Body by Sam Pope Brewer) The first condition had

been that the council was to give first priority to the under-

ground fighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Secondly, Ray had insited that anyone too closely associated with

the Batista regime would not be used in the invasion and

lastly, he was to have been allowed prior approval before

4198-39

any military leader of the invasion was named. (Ibid) Ray told

the assembled newsmen that his program to overthrow Castro

was based on maximum mobilization of the discontented people

inside Cuba and that the leadership of this underground should

come from Cubans who could prove they had such a potential

force.

(ibid)

Ray then sought CIA support independing of the Council, ()

explaining

to Agency personnel that the MRP did have an

effective underground organization but needed material and

financial support.

'Ray felt it nessary for his organization

to be allowed to plan its own operations and broaden its base

of financial support to include sympathetic Latin American

governments.

He was totally opposed to any future invasion

attempt.
