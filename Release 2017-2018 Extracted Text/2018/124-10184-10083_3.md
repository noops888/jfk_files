ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

1

By letter 71915 2 4 to myRe Frank Church, dy

we noted that the Senate Select Committee had in its possession

certain materials, which were compiled by the Commission on ~

CIA Activities Within the United States, for the preparation

of its report to the President, which materials most probably

contained information regarding FBI operations of the utmost

sensitivity. In order to avoid any inadvertent compromisé of

such information, we requested an opportunity to meet with

Senators Church and Tower at the earliest convenience to

discuss areas of this Bureau's activities which might warrant

special consideration. Senator Church agreed that the above

matter would be discussed with Director Kelley at the latter's

appearance before the Executive Session of the Senate Select

Committee meeting scheduled for 7/REC 88*

12-11-525-400

For your additional information, this Bureau had

earlier ascertained that the Senate Select Committee has had

access to a 693-page document prepared by CIA listing instances

wherein CIA believed its operations may have exceeded its

mandate. A review of this document by Bureau personnel indi-

cated that some of these operations involve matters involving

this Bureau of an extremely sensitive nature.

In response to

a request of CIA for copies of pertinent material contained

in the above 693-page document, CIA on this date furnished

copies of the material requested.

3 JUL 22 1975

In anticipation of the Director's appearance before

SSC on 7/16/75, the above material furnished by CIA consisting

of approximately 174 pages was reviewed. This material is

found to contain numerous references, in sanitized form, to
