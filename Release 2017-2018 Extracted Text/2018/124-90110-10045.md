Re: Unknown Subjects (2); Alleged

Attempt on Life of Joseph Merola

Obstruction of Justice

States District Court in Chicago, Illinois. Sam Mannarino,

FBI Number 11 584 D, was one of the defendants in this case.

Since this trial there have periodically been rumors that some

harm might befall Merola as Sam Mannarino and his brother,

Gabriel Mannarino, FBI Number 854 850, are regarded as vicious

hoodlums who operate out of the Pittsburgh-New Kensington,

Pennsylvania area. 'Merola lives on Miami Beach, Florida, at the

present time.

On December 4, 1962, Sol Vizzini, Investigator for

the U. S. Bureau of Narcotics,

Miami, Florida, stated on

November 13, 1962, he contacted a confidential informant of

his who has provided both reliable and unreliable information

in the past.

This informant told Vizzini he heard a rumor that

there was a killer in town accompanied by an apprentice, and

these two men had been sent down to do some work by two brothers

from New Kensington, Pennsylvania. Vizzini's source stated the

two men were staying in Room 823 at the Eden Roc Hotel, Miami

Beach, Florida. Vizzini stated his informant claimed the killer

was a

white male, about 57 years of age, Jewish descent, 5'9-94"

brown hair, greying at the temples. The informant described

the apprentice killer as white male, age 27, Jewish descent;

and taller than the other man.

On December 4, 1962, William Kenney, Department of

Justice Attorney presently assigned to Miami, advised he had

previously been in contact with Vizzini in this matter.

He

added a confidential informant of his about the same time had

told him there was a killer in the Miami area named Charlie

Weiss. Mr. Kenney related a man named Charlie Weiss was

mentioned in connection with McClellan Committee hearings.

Re :

Unknown Subjects (2); Alleged

Attempt on Life of Joseph Merola

On December 13, 1962, MI. Kenney made available

a photograph of Charles Socrates Weiss referred to in the

McClellan Committee hearings. This individual is New

York Police Department Number 57106 and was arrested by

them on September 27, 1932.

No additional descriptive

data is available on Weiss.

On December 7, 1962, Ronnie Lynch; Detective for

the Dade County Department of

Public Safety, Miami, Florida,

advised he determined that on October 28, 1962, one Bernard

Mitchell of Chicago checked into Room 823 at the Eden Roc

Hotel on Miami Beach.

On November 1, 1962, Mitchell was

joined by one Samuel Stern. Stern checked out November 8,

1962. Phillip Litner joined Mitchell in Room 823 on November

8, 1962, and checked out November 10, 1962.

On November 15,

1962, a woman who identified herself as Mitchell's wife joined

him in Room 823 and as of November 22, 1962, was still occupy-

ing that room with him. Lynch stated

on November 22, 1962,

he discontinued his inquiry when the descriptive data on

Mitchell and his associates did not coincide with that given

by Vizzini's informant.

Vizzini, Lynch, and Kenney speculated that if

killers had been

engaged by two brothers in New Kensington,

Pennsylvania, and sent to Miami Beach, the brothers might

be the Mannarino brothers and the victim might be Merola.

On December 4, 1962, Mr. Kenney advised he has periodic

contact with Merola, he has advised Merola of the rumors,

Merola does not seem to be upset or concerned, and Merola

was out of town on December 4, 1962.
