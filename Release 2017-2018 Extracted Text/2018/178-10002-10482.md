I have cerefully questioned fir. Ialpers,

Executive Officer/TFM, on this briefing and ho

distloctly recalls advising Lausdale orally on the

morning of 26 October 1132 that the Matahambre

Operation had been re-rin; that we had not heard

from the team; had not been able to recover the team,

and must presume the tein to be oltber.lost or in

hiding.

(23) The mention oj the Natahambre Operation,

10:39

as best I can rocall, al: the meeting of the Special

Group (Augmented) came up in an aside, I belleve

rom General laylor, var asked In effect, "Whatever

appened to that sabotage operation", and mes advised

orally that it had been re-run; that

the caching pert

of the operation had been successiul, but that the

sabotage torn bad not ben beard fion the must ba

presumed lost.

Unfortunately, my operational diary

notes on this point reflect only that the datahunbre

Operation was mentioned casually at the Spectal Group

(hugmented) nceting.

3.

All of the comments contained in the chronology 1n

reference nemorandum aro substautiated either by menornnds,

operational notes, or operational diary records.

As you are aware, my memorandum to you dated 11. Noven-

bor 1962 was prepared prior to the rocelpt o1 Lensdale's

nemorandum and wus not desigued as an answer to it. Set out

bolow for your further Inforsation ere pertinent comments

concerning the specific points nade in Lengdale's monorendum.

With regard to paregraph 2 of Lanscale's

nonorrndun as reflectec by reference chronology,

the staterent that Operntion Mongoose had had no

information on this operation since early Octcher

Execific referenco is ade to

the penultinato paragraph in Lansdalo's menorandur

I have discussed this matter in detall. with

reflected in my reference memorandum. During this

conversation there mai no discussion of previous

operations except a biief discussion of the COBRA

Mr Choovers recolloction, ask any specific questions

concerning assets inside or prior operationg nich
