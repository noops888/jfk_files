“Review of Project LIEMPTY © ae
“(por the pupose of Project Renita : ‘

A. Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment ciara in relation to project!
objectives): i

1, “To colicet operational information periatiing eo LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities,” SCANTLING has.concinued (see pre-
vlous Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA~-17999, 31
October 1961, HMMA- 14093, 13 November-1959, and HMMA- 15979, 18
N. vember 1960) to provide worthwhile tformation pertaining to thts ob-
jective, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used cx=
tensively to follow up Icads produced by LLFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex-
cellent example of-this blending of various Station support assets was the
tavestigatlon and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads trom both
LIENVOY arid LIFEAT Indicated the possibility of launching a successful
technical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIMERICK
intelligence officer assigned to Mexico.under diplomatic cover, With the
aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed
by SCANTLING, Statlon KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station
support assets, were successful In installing a technical device in the

target.

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping
current records on the residences of the many Soviet personnel in Mexico
City. This ts priniartly accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of
all LIENVOY leads which indicate intérest by Soviets in specific quarters,
(See previous project renewal requests for additional details, )

2, "To collect operational intormation pertaining to-other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in-
terest Gperating in Mexico", SCANTLING is very useful for collecting ta-
formation on oer Station targets:

a. On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in
Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an
operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural
machinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transit to Cuba,. To
mount this operation, a precise and detalled casing of the imple-
ment was essential, This Racer trdanis was | able a
one irip io Vora

the operation.



b,  SCANTLING provided the Station a detailed inveatigation
of Harotun ("Harry") KOPOIAN, . employee of American Communists:
Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which ". determined the residence’ ,
of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and connections,

ec In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of .
an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected
Station technical operation,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debricfings,
and surveillances," SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a. SCAN‘ FLING completed a detailed and secure interview of
O2 the fiancee of |BESMOOTH.to determine her connection with the
ol principals in the MAYFOWL case, particularly any connection
with procuremen| ‘of documents used bi the flight behind the Iron
Curtain, This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING
was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an
admirable job whtle maintaining his cover for having the interview,

b,. SCANTLING was called on for extensive Initial spade work

in the[BEKNAVE/B SHICK operation, SCANTLING gave his
usual Competent pertermance despite the fact that the role assigned

him was unique-to his experience,

ow

c, SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive
Station Soviet double agent which contributed slgnificayrly to that

operation.

d, SCANTLING was used extensively during the visic of
GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort-in providing maximum
protection for the GPIDEAL party,

e, In addition, SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and
neighborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive,
SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by
ODACID and other ODYOKE componcnis,

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING
is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, : for example,
SCANTLING handled LIEMBROIL-2 until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in July
1962, SCANTLING is.also used to spot and rent safe house;
for other Station operations, SEC: ahi

although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never bé com:
pletely fulfilled, ic is the Station's opinion Unit SCANTLING ‘has made’.
important and valuable contributions:to LIEMPTY Project objecitves
specifically and co other Station activities in general, SCANTLING's

production, neasured against monetary expenditures; case officér time
iad other intengible factors, unquestionably justifics als continisatton

B. Raymord , GERENDE Segment (atacussed in relation to project
objectives):

1, “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and. physical facillttes through use of photographic baye houses, "
‘Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, courbes
to. this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the. functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective. ‘This was described in derail in the 1960 Request for | -
Project Renewal, (HMMA-15979)

2, “To collect operational information and tdentify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objeciive,
Among LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographie assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have
never been pliategraphed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party
Headquarters, During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover
the recent mave of PCM Headquarters (the flrst information Station had
of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site,

3, “Yo provide operational support to Staticn operations, i.e. ,
rent hotel rooms and apart ments, and conduct counter-survelllances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operaiiozs and activities, GERENDE’s comprehensive area
knowledg2 and personal operational capabiticies combine to make him an
extremely valusble Sation asset for such support activities, GERENDE

also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

“Station concludes, theretore, tat this Segment of the. LIEMPTY "Project
should be continued,

_ GC. Relationship to’ Related Mission Directive Objectives: . ieee

As stated {In previous project renewals, it can readily be noced that
Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and In *
this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related
Mission Directive, The project has not produced any-p ositive Intelligence
nor has it been Intended that tt should do so, ‘The project's sole purpose
ig to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information
tn support of other Station operations,

1, , CHANGES

i There have been no changes In the LIEMPTY Project during the
past project ycar affecting cither objectives or personnel, : : :

Il, EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter
the validity of the remarks made in Section II] of 1960 project renewal re- :
quest (IMMA: 15979) : coe

IV, PROBLEMS

The security problem In connection with the LICALLA operation,
which was described in 1960: renewal request, is still present but has
caused no known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the
LICALLA.base was reactivated on.29 May 1961. The base operator con-
tinues to be alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the
base has becn compromised,

V. PLANS , '

The Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum
size and does not, plan to expand it during the coming year, Efforts will 1 .
be continued to refine and better utilize the existing project organizational i
arrangements, As in the past, the Station will continue ils efforis to
