Review of Project: LIEMPTY

â€¢(For the purpose of Projeci Renewal)

1.. CURRENT OUJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

Oliver Go SCANTLING Segment (discussed In relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining so LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has.continued (see pre-

Vlous Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMALI-17999; 31

October 1961, HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959, and HNA/A-15979, 18

N. vember 1960) to provide worthwhile Information pertaiting to this ob-

jective.

During the past year SCANTLING has continued to bo used ex-

tensively so follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY. An ex-

cellent example of this blending of various Station support assets was the

investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both

LIENVOY and LIFEAT indicated the possibility of launchug a successful

recinical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIVERICK

intelligence officer assigned to Mexico. under diplomatic cover. with the

aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed

by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Starion

support assets, were successful in installing a technical device in the

rarget.

SCANTLING continues to he the Station's primary means of keeping

current records on the residences of ihe many Soviet personnel in Mexico

City. This is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of

all LIENVOY leads which indicate interesi by Suviers in specific quarters.

(See previous project renewal requesis for additional details. )

2.

"To collect operational intormation pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, foreign official installarions and personnel of intelligence in-

terest operaring

in Mexico". SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-

formation on oiler Station targets:

a.

On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in

Veracruz, the Starion (with Headquarters support) mounted an

operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural

machinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transit to Cuba.: To

mount this operation, a precise and detalled casing of the imple-

ment was essentlal.

This SCANTLING was able ie accompllsh in

the operation.

b.

SCANTLING provided the Station a detalled Investigation

of Harotun (Harry') KOPOLAN, employee of American Communists

Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which

determined the residence

of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and connections.

In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of

an official Yugoslav Installation In conjunction with a projected

Station technical opcration.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debricfinge,

and survelllances. " SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both

directly and Indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a. SCANTLING completed a detailed and secure intery lew of

0.2 the fiance of BESMOOIH to determine her connection with the

principals in the MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection

with procurement of documents used In the flight behind the Iron

Curtain, This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING

was not told true reason for Interview) and SCANTLING did an

admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the Interview.

SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work

in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation, SCANTLING

gave his

usual competent pertermance despite the fact that the role assigned

him was unique to his experience.

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive

Station Soviet double agent which contributed significamly to that

opcration.

d. SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of

GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort. in providing maximum

protection for the GPIDEAL party.

c. In addition, SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and

neighborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive.

SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by

ODACID and other ODYOKE components.

4.

In addition to his contributions to the above objecilves, SCANTLING

is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, For example,

SCANTLING handled LIEMBROIL- 2 until the return of LIMOTOR -14 in July

1962. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and aptrtments

for other Station operations. SESHE?

As stated in the prececuing Requests for Project Rencwal,

although SCANTLING'S LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be com-

pletely fulfillev, is is the Station's opinton that SCANTLING has made

Important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectlves

specifically and io other Station activites in general. SCANTLING's

production, nessured against monetary expenditures; case officer time

and other intengible factors, unquestlonably justific his continuation

us in liegrad par: of Project LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond I, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

persoinel and physical facilitles through use of photographic baye houses."

Three phorographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute

co this objeciire. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual

description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above objective. This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for

Project Renewal. (UMMA- 15979)

2. "To collect operational information and Identify operational

leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity. " The LIENTRAP operation;

handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective.

Among LIENTR.$P's regular and extensive photographie assignments, was

the photo stakeour of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have

never been phoographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party

Headquarters. During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover

the recent more of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had

of the move) ani to continue photo surveillance at the new site.

3. "To provide operational support to Staticn operations, l.e...

rent hotel roones and apartments, and conduct counter-survelllances.

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other

Station operatiors and activities.

GERENDE's comprehensive area

knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an

extremely valuable Sation assei for such support activities. GERENDE

also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them.

SECRET

The qually and quantity of operational Information produced

by the photographic bases and other acilvities under GERENDE:s control

and supervision Is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique. The

Station concludes, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project

should be continued.

C. Relatlonship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in prevlous project renewals, It can readily be noied that

Project LEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in

this manner has been a contributlig fuctor to the furtherance of the Related

Mission Dircctive. The project has not produced any positive intelligence

nor has i been Intended that it should do so.

The project's sole purpose

is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information

in support of other Station operations.

11. CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the

past project year affecting cither objectives or personnel.

IlI. EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter

the validity of the remarks made in Scction Ill of 1960 project renewal re-

ques: (I IMMA: 15979)

IV. PROBLEMS

The security problem In connectlon with the LICALLA operation,

which was described in 1900 rcnewal request, is still present but has

caused no known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the

LICALLA base was reactivated on 29 May 1961.

The base operator con-

tinues to be alort for any unusual Incidents which might indicate that the

base has been compromised.

V. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum

size and does not plan to expand it during the coming year.

Elforts will

be continued to refine and better utilize the existing projeci organizational

arrangements. As in the pasi, the Station will continue its efforis lu

Improve the compartmentation and sec

rity of the project.
