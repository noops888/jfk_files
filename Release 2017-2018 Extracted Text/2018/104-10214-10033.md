MEMORANDUM

This reconstruction of Agency involvement in plans to

assassinate Fidel Castro 1s at best an imperfect history. Because

of the extreme sensitivity of the operations being discussed or

attempted, as a natter of principle no official records were kept

'of planning, of approvals, or of implementation. The few written

records that do exist are either largely tangential to the main

events or were put on paper from memory years afterward. W11liam

Harvey has retained skeletal notes of his activities during the

years in question, and they are our lest source of dates.. Di.

Edward Gunn, of the Office of Medical Services, has a record of

whom he met and when and cryptic references to the subjects discussed.

of TSD, has a record of tro or three dates that are

pertinent.

Gunn end

were Involved la only the technical

aspects of operational planning, and their participations were short-

lived. Although fragmentary, their records are a help in establishing

critical time frames. Operational files are useful in some Instances,

because they give dates of meetings, the substances of which may be

Inferred fron collateral information.

For the most part, though, we have had to rely on information

given to us orally by people whose memories are fogged by time.

Their recollections of dates are particularly hazy, and soue of then

are no longer able to keep the details of one plan separate from thore

of another. We Intervieved everyone whom we could identify as likely

to be knowledgeable, with the exceptions of Mr. Dulles and General

Cabell. A complete list 1s attached at Tab A. le did not go on

fishing expeditions among the mere possibles. To have done so would

have risked making witting a number of employees who were previously

witting and, in our estinate, would have added little to the details

available fron those directly involved. There are inconsistencies

among the various accounts, but most of them can be resolved by

collating the information furnished by all of the identifiable

participants in a perticuler plan and by then checking It against

specific dates that can be fired with fair certainty. We telieve

that this reconstruction of what happened and of the thinking

associated with it is reasonably sound. If there are significant

Inaccuracies in the report, they are most likely to occur in faulty

ordering of the sequence of events. People still remember much of

what happened, but they can no longer recall precisely when.

It became clear very early in our investigation that the vigor

with which schemes were pursued within the Agency to eliminate Castro

personally varied with the Intensity of the U.S. Goverment's efforts

to overthrow the Castro regime. We can identify fIve separate phases

In Agency assassination planning, although the transitions from one

to another are not alvays sbarply defined. Each phase is a reflection

of the then prevailing Goverment attitude toward the Cuban regime.

a. Prior to Auzust 1950: All of the Identiflable schemes

prior to about August 1960, with one possible exception, vere

aimed only at discrediting Castro personally by influencing

his behaviour or by alterine his appearance.

b. August 1960 to April 1961: The plots that were hatched

In late 1960 and early 19ó1 vere aggressively pursued and were

viewed by at least some of the participants as being merely one

aspect of the over-all active effort to overthrow the regime

that culminated in the Bay of Pigs.

c. April 1961 to late 1961: A major scheme that was

begun In August 1960 was called off after the Bay of Ples and

remained dormant for several months, as did most other Agency

operational activity related to Cuba.

do Late 1961 to late 1962: That particular scheme was

reactivated in eariy 1952 and was again pushed vigorously in the

era of Project MONGOOSE and in the climate of intense admini

stration pressure on CIA to do something about Castro and his .

and nothing ever came of them.

• We cannot overemphasize the extent to which responsible Agency

officers felt themselves subject to the/administration's severe

pressures to do sorething about Castro and his regime.

The fruitless

and, in retrospect, often unrealistie plotting should be vieved in

that 11ght.

-... Many of those ve intervieved stressed two points that are so

obvious that recording them here may be superfluous. We belleve,

though, that they are pertirent to the story. Elimination of the

dominant figure In a goverment, even when loyaltles are beld to him

personally rather than to the goverment as a body, vill not

necessarily cause the downfall of the governent. This point was

stressed with respect to Castro and Cuba in an Internal CIA draft

paper of October 1961, bich was initiated in response to General

Maxvel] Taylor's desire for a contirgency plan. The paper took the

position that the demise of Fidel Castro, from whatever cause, would

offer little opportunity for the liberation of Cuba fran Communist

and Soviet Bloc control. The second point, which is more specifically

relevant to our investigation, is that bringing about the downfall of

a goveriment necessarily requires the removal of its leaders from

There 15 & third point, nich wus not directly made by any of

those ve intervieved, but which energes clearly from the interviews

and from review of files. The point is thet of freguent resort to

synecdoche-- the mertion of a part when the whole is to be understood,

or vice versa. Thus, we encounter reptated references to phrases such

as "disposing of Castro," which may be read in the narrow, literal

sense of assassinating him, when it is Iniended that 1t be read in

the broader, figurative sense of dislodging the Castro regine.

Reversiag the cold, ve flad people speaking vaguely of "doing Bone-

'thing about Castro" when it is clear that what they have specifically

In mind is killing him. In a situation wherein those speaking may

not have actually meant what they seemed to say or may not have said

what they actually weant, they should not be surprised 11 their oral

shorthand is interpreted differently than vas intended.

• The suggestion was made to us that operations aimed at the

assassination of Castro may have been generated in an atmosphere of

stress in Intelligence publications on the possibility of Castro's

follow. We revleved intelligence publications from 1960 through

1966, Including " Sonal Intelligence Estimates, Special National

Intelligence Estimates, Intelligence Memorandums, and Memoranduns

short references in a SNIE of March 1950 and in an Intelligence

Memorandum of May 1965. In each case the treatment is so more nor

less than one would expect to find in comprehensive round-ups ruch

as these. We conclude that there. is no reason to believe that the

operators were unduly influenced by the content of Intelligence

publications.

Drew Pearson's column of 7 March 1967 refers to a reported CIA

plau In 1963 to assassinate Cuba's Fluel Castro. Pearson also has

Information, as yet unpublished, to the effect that there was &

meeting at the State Department at which assassination of Castro

was discussed and that a team actually. landed in Cuba with pills to

be used in an assassination attempt. There is basis In fact for each

of those three reports.

a. A CIA officer passed an assassination veapon to an

Agency Cuban asset at a meeting in Paris on 22 November 1963..

The veapon was a ballpolat pen rigged as a hypodermic syringe.

In Secretary Russ's conference room on 10 August 1962 at which

1a behalf of CIA on a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. The 19ói

plot aborted and the pills vere recovered.. Those furnished in

April 1962 were passed by the gambling syndicate representative

to a Cuban exile leader in Florida, who In turn had them sent to

Cuba about May 19F2. In June 1962 the extle leader reported that

a team of three men had been dispatched to Cuba to recruit for the

operation. If the opportunity presented Itseif, the team would

make an attempt on Castro's life--perhaps using the pills.

Miscellaneous Schemes Prior to August 1960

March to August 1960

We find evidence of at least three, and perhaps four; schemes

that were under consideration.well before the Bay of Pigs, but we

can fix the time frame only speculatively. Those who have some

knowledge of the episodes guessed at dates ranglog from 1959 through

1961. The Marid-to-August span we have fixed may be too narrow, but

1t best. fits the limited evidence we have.

8. None of those ve interviered who was first assigned to

the Cuba task force after the Bay of Pigs knows of any of these

schemes.

D. J. D. (Jake) Esterline, who was head of the Cuba task

force in pre-Bay of Pigs days, is probably the most rellable

witness on general timing. He may not have been privy to the

precise details of any of the plans, but he seems at least to

have known of all of them. He is no longer able to keep the

details of one plan separave from those of another, but each of the

facets be recalls fits somewbere into one of the schemes.

Bence,

we conclude that all of these schemes vere under consideration

while Esterline bad direct responsibility for Cuba operations.

c. Esteritne himself furaishes the best clue as to the

porsible time span. He thinks It unlikely that any planning

of this sort would have progressed to the point of consideration

of means until after U.S. policy concerning Cuta was decided

upon about March 1960. By about the end of the third quarter

of 1960, the total energies of the task force were concentrated

on the main-thrust effort, and there would have been no interest

In nor time for pursuing such wills-o'-the-visp as these.

We are unable to establish even a tentative sequence among the schemes;

they may, 1n fact, have been under consideration simultaneously. We.

find no evidence that any of these schemes was approved at any

level higher thas division, 1f that. We think it most Ilkely that

no higher-level approvals vere sought, because none of the schemes

progressed to the point where approval to launch would have been

needed.

Sidney Gottlie, of ISD, claims to remember distlactly a plot

Involving cigars. To empbasize the clarity of his menory, he named

the officer, then assigned to Hy/CA, who approached him with the

scheme. Although there may well have been such a plot, the officer

Gottlieb named was then assigned in Indis and has never worked in

WE Division nor had anything to do vith Cuba operations. Gottlleb

remembers the scheme as being one that was talked about frequently

but not videly and as being concerned with killing, not merely with

Influencing behaviour. As far as Gottlieb knows, this idea never

got beyond the talking stage. ISD nay bare gone ahead and prepared

the cigars just in case, but Gottlleb is certain that be did not get

the DD/p's (Richard Bissell) personal approval to release them, as vould

discover whether Esterline and Gottlleb are speaking of e single

cigar episode or of two unrelated schenes. He found no one else vita

1960.
