JECRET

TO : : WH/3

FROM : Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT: CIFFNCE/4

29 November 1971

IRD# 72501

BACKGROUND:

Subject, CIFENCE/4, is a 49-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A

who has been of continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact.

He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK as does his wile.

He was last SGSWIRLed on 23 May 1968 with favorable results. Subject

claimed that during service with IDEN E and previous service with

JKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLed and estimated the total number of

SGSWIRLs he has had at twelve to fifteen.

PROCEDURE:

On 3 November 1971, CIFENCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert

site in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilized in

discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case (filcer, Edgar B. MARTEGANI,

served as interpreter. During the SGSWIRL. the Enalish language was

used. The undersigned was introduced as

from WOCORK.

PURPOSE:

The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar E. MARTEGANI to determine

whether Subject knows if any member of IDEN D and specifically if IDEN E

Is aware or suspects his current JKLANCE connections; if he has been

requested to work against INLUTE; If since May 1968 he has been in con-

tact with or heard about IDEN F or LDEN G; If since May 1968 Subject has

been inv.ilved in illegal arms smuggling. Specific questions utilized during

the SCSWIRL are given later in this report.

CONCLUSION:

There were no unresolved reactions indicative of deception. It

Is the opinion of the undersigned that Subject answered all questions truth

IRDE 72501

• Page 8

29 November 1971

fully. Apparently Subject is unaware of any compromise of his LNLUTE

connections; has been truthful in his reports to JKLANCE; has not been

Involved in any illegal arms dealings other than smuggling weapons into

IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of

IDEN D and related organizations; has not been asked to work against

INLUTE and has received no information from or about IDEN F or IDEN G.

DETAILS:

Subject was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not

hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses.

He seemed open and frank in response to all queries. Subject exhibited

& response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDEN G. Discussion

of the issue elicited the information that Subject had recelved some inform-

ation concerning a son of one of these Individuals.

He also mentioned

that on a trip to IDEN H a few years ago he had spoken by telephone to

IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDEN G. Subject

also showed a response to the question concerning illegal arms dealing.

He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought

back pistcls, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun. These weapons

were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E

or members of IDEN D. He stated that the weapons were brought in

illegally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own

use) was illegal. Specific questions concerning these arms dealings

were asked. Based on the sessions results, it appears that while Sub

ject has smuggled arins into IDFN A and possesses illegal arms, he has

not been involved in smuggling large amounts of arins for personal profit

or engaged since May 1968 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN A.

Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:

Were you born in IDEN J? Yes

Did you reside in WOCORK? Yes

Are you concealing the identity of anyone who knows you work for JKI ANCE?

A.I.: Paragriphs '2 and 3 belon

1. : I appreciate

with Circlin the event of another enorgency astuation in

offer for possible future contact

Trinidnd, i poseibility which should not be totally ruled out.

I was avare that four or Iive Venozuelan officials and arrived

in Port of Spain shortly after the declaration of & state of

emergency;

but I had no contact with any of these individuals

during their stay here.

I agree with CIPINCe that it would have been to the

advantage to have had

contact with him during the

period of the Regiment mutiny.

To this end, I propose the

folloing contact arrangements:

When CITINCE & has arrived in

Port of Spain and has gotten hinself set up, he should call

Identity A on Identity B during normal office hours (0800-1700).

One hour after telephonie contact has been made with Identity A,

CIFENCE 111 be picked up. in Identity C at Identity D.

In

order to establish bona fides,

the case officer will ask of

CIFENCE- "Aro you a friend of Pedro's?".

CIFENCE-1 should

respond "Yes, and of Tomas also.".

Recognition signals having

been exchanged and authenticated,

I would feel free to ask

CIPINCI-A to keep ne informed of developments fron his side as

they occurred.

Chief, Alien Affairs Staff

Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles (A 12 419 708)

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence concerning

this case.

2.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service, by letter

dated 16 April 1970, has granted the benefits of Section 316(b) of

the Immigration and Nationality Act to cover the subject's absence

from the United States from 20 March 1970, to an indefinite period,

thereafter, and so long as he remains absent on behalf of the United

States Government, with the understanding that he will prove to the

satisfaction of the Naturalisation Court when he files a Petition for

United States Citizenship, five years after entry for permanent

residence, that he has been absent during this period for that pur-

pose.

The benefits of this Section of the Act also permit subject

to count the period of his absence toward both the residence and

physical presence requirements for naturalization, provided that,

since becoming a permanent resident of the United States and be-

fore applying for naturalization, he has completed an uninterrupted

period of one year of physical presence in the United States.

3. The letter is being retained in the files of this Office and it

is requested you so advise Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles.
