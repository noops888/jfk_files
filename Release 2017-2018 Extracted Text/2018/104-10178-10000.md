EGRET -

TO . : WH/3 20 November 1971
FROM 2 Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT: CIFFNCE/4 | IRD? 72601
BACKGROUND;

Subject, CIFENCE/4, is a 48-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A
who has been of continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact,
He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK' as does his wife.

-He was last SGSWIRLed on 23 May 1968 with favorable results. Subject

claimed that during service with IDEN E and previous service with
JKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLed and estimated the total number of
SGSWIRLs he ‘has had at twelve to fifteen,

PROCEDURE:

On 3 November 1971, CIFEFNCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert
sile in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilized in
discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case Cfficer, Edgar B. MARTEGANI,

served as interpreter. During the SGSW) inguage was
used. The undersigned was introduced from WOCORK.

PURPOSE:

The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar B. MARTEGANI to determine
whether Subject knows if any member of IDEN D and specifically if IDEN E
is aware or suspects his current JKLANCE connections; if he has been
requested to work against LNLUTE; if since May 1968 he has been in con~
tact with or heard about IDEN F or IDEN G; if since May 1968 Subject has
been invived in illegal arms smuggling. Specific questions utilized during
the SCSWIRL are given later in this report.

CONCLUSION:

There were no unresolved reactions indicative of deception. It
is the opinion of the undersigned that Subject answered all questions

SECRET [



~ SECRET

IRD? 72501
- Page 2
29 November 1971

fully. Apparently Subject.ts unaware of any compromise cf his LNLUTE
connections; has been truthful in his reports to JELANCE; has not been
involved in any {legal arms dealings other than Smuggling weapons into
IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of
IDEN D and related organizations; has not been asked to work against
LNLUTE and has received no information from or about IDFN F or IDEN G.

DETAILS;

Subject was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not
hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses,
He seemed open and frank in response to all queries. Subject exhibited
@ response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDFNG, Discussion
of the issue elicited the information that Subject had received some inform-
ation concerning a son of one of these individuals. He also mentioned
that cn a trip to IDEN H a few years ago he had spoken by telephone to
IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDFN G. Subject
also showed a response to the question concerning illegal arms dealing.
He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought
back pistcls, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun. These weapons
were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E
or members of IDFN D, He stated that the weapons were brought in
ileyally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own
use) was illegal. Specific questions concerning these arms dealings
were asked. Based on the sessions results, it appears that while Sub-
ject has smuggled arms into IDFN A and possesses illegal arms, he has
not been involved in smuggling large amounts of arms for personal profit
or engaged since May 1968 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN A,

Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:
Were you born inIDEN J? Yes
Did you reside in WOCORK! Yes.

Are you concealing the identity of anyone who knows you work for JKL ANCE?
No

1, Reference is made to previous correspondence concerning
this case. . :

-2.. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, by letter

“dated 16 April 1970, has granted the benefits of Section 316(b) of

absence

the Immigration and Nationality Act to cover the subject'

. from the United States from 20 March‘1970, to an indefinite period,

thereafter, and so long as he remains absent on behalf of the United
States Government, with the understanding that he will prove to the
satisfaction of the Naturalization Court when he files a Petition for
United States Citizenship, five years after eatry for permanent
residence, that he has been absent during this period for that pur-
pose. The benefits ‘of this Section of the Act also permit subject
to count the period of his absence toward both the residence and
physical presence requirements for naturalization, provided that,
since becoming a permanent resident of the United States and be-
fore applying for naturalization, he has completed an uninterrupted
period of one year of physical presence in the United States.

3. The letter is being retained in the files of this Office and it
is requested you so advise Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles.

SUBJECT : sIais Clemente POSADA Carriles (201-300985)

REFERENCE : Caracas 4018 (IN 87480) copy attached

. requested Headquarters
ista zi 8 quickly possible a citizea-
ship question concerning Subject. In view of Subject's
operational importance to the Station we would appreciate
any effort your office could make to obtain a favorable

decision in this matter.

3. Since Subject actually obtained his own job
through a friend in DISIP and made, his own travel arrange-
ments, the file does not reflect what type of documentation
he has other that an expired reentry permit mentioned in
the reference. A biographic data sheet is attached which
gives the main points in Subject's background including
his U.S. military service.

4. Te prisary concera at this point is whether accepting
Venezuelan citizenship for operational reasons will destroy
or jeopardize in any way, Subject’s plans to become a U.S.



citizen? {It will be appreciated if your office could make

fa determination on this question as soon as possible,
euphasizing to the appropriate authorities our concern for.
Subject and. his operational importance to the U.5. intelligence

effort. :
