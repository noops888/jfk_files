MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH-4
: .=THROUGH: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: Draft Memorandum, dated 26, October
1961 (attached)

l, [have no real quarrel with the attached document, but
: "IT would hope that we would follow the realistic and specific
position adopted by Chief, WH-4 at the Slate Department meeting
on 26 October, In other words, we have four major points :
which need settling with Miro according to an agreed upon ling.
In addition, we need to find out what other complaints Miro has
and try to work out solutions acceptable to both sides, Finally,
we must establish a working relationship between Wendell Johnson
and Miro through which we can attempt to persuade Miro of the
need of reconstituting his efforts in order to undertake a.more
i constructive program thati his.present purely administrative one.
In the meantime here in Washington we should be recxamining
the whole question of how to deal with Cuban cxiles with the
i thought that we may be able to present recommendations for a
: 7 change in the present policy position, On this last point I have
talked to Sherman Kent 's office and hope in the near future to
receive a report advising what the estimators think they can
contribute on these last issues, At that time we can also get a

time schedule,

2. I repeat, however, that for the moment:let us con-
centrate on the major problems with Miro, eliminate the ambi-
guities which have existed between ourselves, State and the White
House and try to obtain Miro's confidence in order to be more
persuasive with him in the future,

DRAFT

1.. It ie our. feeling that it would be desirable to deal with one
eS aa

representative of the Cuban exile movements and onestepreseatative of the

Cuban. underground. : Need for coordination of activities alone makes this

logical, -However, we all recognize that both the exile movement and

the underground are badly split into‘factions, It will be a continuous

struggle to achieve cooperation between these factions, and to achieve

complete unity a a practical political mattis not very realistic. Even

within the Council, and within the FRD,there are elements which will

cooperate with each other on some things and not on others, The experience

with Justo CARRILLO and with Manolo RAY among others, makes this amply

clear,

2. AGcordingly, as discussed by Dr. MIRO with Mr, HANLEY and
Mr, CLARK, in Baltimore in mid-September, there must be cher unifying and
coordinating factors than simply aéserting the U, S. Governrnent or some
one agency will lend support 'tj,rough the CRC, and anyone who wants funda

must go to the CRC, For example, it has Know become apparent that

the withdrawal of support from the AFJ,as requested by Dr. MIRO,has simply

meant that the AFJ has become vocally opposed to the CRC, The leverage

formerly exercised with the AFJ has now been removed. A” least wa /¥"'44-

We Were Seameety able to keep them from criticizing the CRC tee-vooaly,

3. We are sometimes dismayed to hear the charges made by Dr.



MIRO that we are not supporting him exclusively. We feel that if we
—e
ae,
withd4w support from some of the other groups, they would become

part of Dr, MIRO's opposition, At the same time, we are dismayed at

“the charges made by Dr, MIRO'e opponents that, .as in fact has been tho case,

a very large proportion of the support for Cuban exile activities has been

given tohim, The other groups claim, as he-does, to have considerable

influence over the underground and the exile communiyg . They too have

contacts in the various Departments of the US. Govornment and in

buaineas in the U. S. and abroad; and, as a long time practical politician,

Dr. MIRO cannot be unaware of the implications of this situation,

4, Wehave, therefore, never agreed that iam it wae feasible to
adopt the highly unrealistic view that exclusive support could be given to
the CRC, since some other groups a) probably would unite againet the CRC,
b) could get support elsewhere, and, c) almost imum inevitably would
organize'a significant anti-CRC movement,

5. We have, therefore, made it known to all groups inside and
outside that while we do not insist (except in the case of the judges) on unifi-
cation and subordination to the CRC, we would prefer that they at least
coordinate with the Council, aml We have actively discouraged any criticiam
of the Council whenever we had an apportunity, somtaeae,

6. Our position has been made difficult by the fact that Dr. MIRO
hae stated or implied to representatives of the various factions that he has

high level U. S. Government sponsorhsip and that the factions cari in fhe

officials that he has presented proposals for assisting the underground and

“for aiding the underground,to a ganize and has received no support from the

Agency, The Agency Is aware.of the proposal to aid RAMIREZ, with whom at

the time it was proposed in Baltinfre, Dr, Miro said he had no communica-
ao sommenicas

We atill de not know whether there ia a era muereaton Une,
or many of tng details needtd to ka aseist RAMIREZ in the Escambray, If

Dr, Miro now hae such detaile, he might pags it to Colonel Johnaon at a

separate mecting. The Agency ts aware ofa pesposal for a 1, 000 man
invasion force psopmuct which was refused by both State and the White House

before it was presented to the Agency. We vee no purpose in commenting

further on that plan, At such time as Dr. MIRO has-epecific plans for

operations to aid the underground, he or hie designee might duaire discuss

them with Colonel Johnson,
7, We would like to point out that during the difficult months eince

fe bd on has
Arpil we have ‘continued to urge the internal resistance groups to organize

in a truly underground manner, to establish iines of command and channela

of communications, and to look to the CRC for guidance. We know that in a
number of instances the external representatives have sought to obtain

guidance from the CRC only after our urging them-taxtemeo, We would hope that
Dr, MIRO will be frank enough to recognize these contacts, and the fact that
thr these contacts he has been generally-informed onthe! Srganizational

activity in Cuba,

8. We would'like to make special note for Dr. MIRO that we are



not engaged in another invasion attempt, arc not training Cubans for

an invasion, and, therefore, “cannot keep him informed on any such

activity, F i :
9. We would like to point out that Dr, MIRO has been in frequent
contact during the oak few months with the Department of State, “represen-
tatives and has, as directed by the White Hause, taken his guidance from
the State Department. He has rarely sought guidance « or even utilized
a6 a channel his contact with the Agency which hae been continuously -
available. Many times it has been impossible to reach Dr. MIRO for us
to arrange a meeting because he, according to ARAGON, was either ill,
ona trip, or preparing for an interview with the State Department or the
White House,
10, It is also worth mentioning that, as Dr. MIRO himself stated
in various meetings, it ie for security reasons neither possible or

desirable to keep Dr, MIRO informed in detail of our activities Peto

Protection,

11, We have long felt there are certain aspects of our work which
could have been done by the Frente, but because of lack of interest or
leadership on the part of some, the Frente took the credit, but did little.

We refer here specifically to propaganda, We feel that if the opposition to

the CRC among the student and labor groups calld be overcome, some very

useful work could be done. We would point-out that much of the DRE and
ia: cL:
Secher


FORD activities have been done with modest and frequently without

any, financial support; We feel that ideas, organization and persone

‘with talent are much more important in these areas than money. We

would lke to urge onceng ain that the FRD and the CRC take practical
steps to work with the people in the DRE and the FORD. We certainly do
not want to aee the energies of these groups diesipated as has so clearly

occured in the cage of the jurists,

12, We renew our proposal once again that Dr. MIRO have his

people come up with some propaganda ideas.and plans with or without

DRE and FORD type participatdionand we will give them our most sympathetic

consideration,

131 Despite our misgivings as to the utility of the further support
of the judiciary groups, we understand a commitment has been made to

gain advance Dr. MIRO $5,000 for the judges and we are honoring this

commitment.
