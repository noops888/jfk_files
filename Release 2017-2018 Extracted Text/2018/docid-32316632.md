MM 105-4769

On June 19, 1963, MM T-1, a Cuban exile who
was formerly a member of the Cuban Rebel Army, and who
is acquainted with certain anti-CASTRO personalities in
the Miami area, advised as follows:
i
~ . MANOLO\AGUIIAR, 829 Southwest Ninth Avenue,
Miami, is Head of the Frente Revolucionario Anticomunista
(FRAC), and was planning to mount one or’more raids
against Cuba in two or three weeks. Source stated the
AGUIIAR group has three boats, two of which are located
in the Miami River, and one in a garage in Miami. It was
also reported that they had a cache of explosives which
they were planning to use on these raids. Source stated
that this group had contacts in New York, where they
were buying arms which they plan to bring to Miami. Among
the equipment which they were seeking to buy were a number
of .57 millimeter recoilless rifles. He stated that this
group also had contacts with fishermen in Key West, Florida,
on whom they could count for assistance in connection with
their proposed raids.

"Diario Las Americas", a Spanish language
newspaper published in Miami, Florida, in its issue of
February 15, 1962, contained a directory of Cuban
Revolutionary and Professional Organizations in Exile.
On this list was the Frente Revolucionario Anticomunista,
453 Northwest Third Street, Miami.

The April 27, 1962 issue of the "Miami Herald"
carried a front page article entitled, "Exiles Train
Again Without U.S. Aid". The article reflected there “/ /
were approximately twenty-two anti-CASTRO groups under=—
going military instruction in the Miami area. Listed-as
participating in this training was MANUEL)AGUIIAR, Head
of the Anti-Comnunist Revolutionary Front’. hin
