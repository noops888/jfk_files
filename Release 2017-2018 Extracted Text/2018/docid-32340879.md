THE REPORT CONCLUDED BY INDICATING THAT ACTION OF CNI AGAINST

THE ABOVE INFORMATION WOULD APPEAR TO IDENTIFY BOSCH'S eed.
IN CHILE AS MEMBERS OF THE CHILEAN NAVY, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY WELL HAVE
BEEN NORMAL, SINCE BOSCH'S PRESENCE IN CHILE WOULD BE OF INTEREST
TO THE CHILEAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN RELATIONS WHICH IS UNDER THE JURIS--
DICTION.OF THE CHILEAN NAVY, LEGAT INTENDS TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION FROM CNI WITH REGARD TO BOSCH’S ALLEGED ‘contacts WITH

IT 1S SUGGESTED THAT LUCAS BORGES OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY
BE IDENTIFIED AND INTERVIEWED CONCERNING HIS REQUEST TO THE CHILEAN

IT I§ SUGGESTED THAT LEGAT, CARACAS, IF POSSIBLE, ATTEMPT —
TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER VENEZUELAN PASSPORT 1,289,386 WAS ISSUED TO
SUAREZ, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUAREZ MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH
FALSE DOCUMENTATION BY MORALES NAVARRETE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE
SUAREZ* TRIP TO CHILE, IT IS NOTED THAT SUAREZ ARRIVED IN CHILE
ONE DAY AFTER BOSCH AVILA AND GUILLERMO NOVO AND DR. ORLANDO FERNAN
AND THAT HE DEPARTED WITH SUILLERMO Novo EN ROUTE TO corona. Yk |
THE INFORMATION, IF TRUE, THAT OTERO HERNANDEZ RESIDED WITH
WORALES NAVARRETE OR AT THE LATTER*S RESIDENCE IN 1968, MIGHT
EXPLAIN OTERO'S CONFIDENCE IN MORALES NAVARRETE WHEN HE FLED THE U.S.
