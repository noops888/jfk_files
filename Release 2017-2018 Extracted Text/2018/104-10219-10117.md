MEMCRANDUM FOR: Mr. James &. Hunt, Jr.,
Deputy Chief, Cl Staff

SUBJECT: Micansl C, SUMAN (201-308566)
7 Mutual Contact of William Hamiltes MARTIN
aad of AEMUSICAL

REVERENCE: Your Momorandam dated 13 Cctober 1951
4 o> wet “Phe M & 4 Caso"

1. Thank you very much for your memorandum of 13 October,
veferenced above, and for the enclosed contact report, including
ALMUSICAL'O report on the information he acquired from Subject
eoncerning the latter's iutorview by OXI and contact with William
Hamilton MARTIN, Noither the biographic data on SUMAN contained
thereia, nox his close scsoclation with beth MARTIN and Bernea
Fergucen MITCHELL were known to we hitherto. Neither were we

-aware of his apparontly extensive correspondence with MARTIN. It

has net been posstbie to date to verify through special sources whether
Sabject's coveespendenca- with MARTIN continued aitor MARTIN's
disappearance from tho United States. We-have not av yot received
the latest NSA ropert of investigation, which would include the ONE
report of istervicw of Subject, since thie document spparently bas .
beea delayed in publication aad transmittal, Howevas, we have been
edvised that the doctinent in question should be availabia in epprozi-
mately one week te ten days, at which time we shall provide you iad
the ONJ report of their interview of Subject.

2, In repty to the query outlined in paragraph 3 of your memo-
Fandam, we seo litle point in attampting ta discourage AEMUSICAL
from passing this information te the Soviets, both on basis of his past
performance in reporting, and because the KGB undoubtedly already is
aware of SUMAN‘s relationship to MARTIN, MITCHELL and AEMUSICAL.
Ae a consequence, if would not appear necessary to request ON] to
clear thie information for passage to the Soviets by AZMUSICAL, pare
ticularly since it mast be assumed thet the KGB is monitoriag all mail
sent and received in the USSR by MAATIN and MITCHELL, Ia order
te simplify the handling of this information both within thie Agency and
the customer agencies involved, it is suggested that a straight CSCI



dissemination of the information obtained by the agest from Subject be
propared by WE/I for GNI, with copies to HSA, the FAL and this office,
each dissemination to be coordinated with Chief, F1/D, prior te release
by the CI Staff, Sech handling, we believe, will enable WE/Ito provide
the appropriate source description and references to earlier correspond
ence with UNI on this case, in ouch wanner as to pormit ready internal
ONI coordination in this matter, and.to protect the identity of tha ageat
as well as to joint operational equities of both the Fil and thie Agency
in this case, Mr. Ludiam of your staff, whe ie familiar to some
extent with the TIDRAMA/AZMUSICAL case, has indteated that this
method’ of handling. the information will:cimplify any further coordinas.
tion with the Navy on matters with which ke is concerned,

3. For your convenience we are forwarding for your information
ae Enclooure A, herewith, a reconstructed chronological outline of the
KGB ksowledge of the relationship between AENUSICAL « Subject +
MARTIN ead MITCHELL, Enclosure A ie based upon information con-
tained in those documento on the case, which were made physically
available to this office for review through the efforts of tar. Hal
Granquist, WE/YCE, who holda the actual 201 file on thie case, includ=
ing alt cperational rezorting beginning with January 1961, Cur review,
therefore, was Limited to the thros-volume TIDMAMA Operational Fil
covering the poriod 1557 through Lecembor 1960, which files were
found in the custody of hirs, Gertrude Wecker of SR/CI/RED,

Me,. Granquist advised that it would:not be posaible for us to have:
similar ican of the material aince December 1960, for reasene cutlined
ig hie note, which ts included in Enclosure B. However, Mr, Granquist
volunteered to review the entire 20) file tn our bebalf, and to extract
the portineat informaiion op SUMAN from:-said file, aad te forward such.
iafermation to thie ofiice. To date, auch review bas produced only one
euch extract, copy cf which is attached as inclosure B,

4. Your particular attontion io invited to the fact that review of
the TIDRAMA Operational Files revoaled that the bulk of the reporting
oa this case, including the identities of TIORAMA-1/AEMUSICAL's
persenai acquaintances, contacts, and operational reporting targets
on whom he bas passed information to the KGB, have never been
indexed into RID indices, and therefore are not reflected in a name
check submitted by other desks or civisions to the Central RID/Index
Section. As a consequence such same check will nct ia any manner
reflect to the requestor that there is any information on such individual
held ip WE/1, even though extensive information may d« available, and
even iudexed in WE/1 card files. This velume of uniodexed reporting
ingledes ioterzal CIA comimunications between Headquarters and Field
Stations, as well as reports to and from the /Bl and other U. S. Agencia:
some of which include. extensive background data on certain of the agont'

j Ideutities mentioned in the AZMUSICAL reports, for which there to

H asd the FBI, edvising that CIA indices contained no references identic

2 copy of this memorandum ie attached-as Enclosure C, Undoubtedly
; a copy of the momoraadum itaelf, or of the infsrmation relayed thereia
‘ wae made available to UNI by NSA prior tc actual ONI contact and inter-
he view ef SUMAN. Ao a result of our receipt of the information forwarded
with your referenced memorandum, a vhysicel recheck was conducted
om 19 Cctober 1961 of all RID/Index cards on file in Central RID/Index
in the surname cf SUMAN, Thin exorcise revealed that ae of that date
there vere absolutely uo cards filed under the nance of Michael C,
SUMAN as ef that date. This check was made prior to our contacting
of Mr. Granquiet tater that day or shortly thereaftor, with regard to
poseible prior reporting un SUMAN, which may have been provided by
the agent in advasce of the latest report. Mr, Granquiot readily
admitted that there had been some previous reporting, but otated that
none of these references had been indexed in or for HID/Index, since
he docon't believe in indexing every name that appears in operational
Yaporting 33 a contact cf the agent, that is “unlees.wo have some
operational interest in. such person, and heretofore we have nevor had
aay euch Intevest in SUMAN, ' He also indicated that SUMAN's name
had been passed to the KGB by ALMUSICAL "some time ago, probably
eround ths turn of the .ysar, '' but was not able to-come up. immediately
with a epocific date. or raference in which details uf this report te the
RGB wae recorded, He alae indicated.that despite pazsage some time
ago (actually pbout 18 months prier to the report forwarded with rofer-
ence) by ALMUSICAL. of Michasl-C. SUMAN's mme to the KGB ae an
iedivideal with whom the agent maintained personal contact, he did not
feel that thie fact, por sa, transformed SUMAN into the category of
persone “of eperational interest to us.’ When queriad for further
detaile on such reporting, Granquist indicated “that he thought he knew
just about where these reports were located in the file, '' and volunteered
to extract the pertinent information and forward same to this office.
However, he indicated that he did not believe he would be able to ict
us borrow the actual 201 itle, which is on permanent charge to W E/1,
and to permit ue furtaer detailed study of the material therein, since
the files were in constant use af the desk. However, he went on to state
that he would be perfectly willing to let us borrow the earlier TIDRAMA
files held by sire, Wecker, if we preierrod to. conduct such review

eourectves, rather than relying upon his:review and extracing of pertinent

materiale from these files, This offer was accepted, and Mrs, Potecki
subsequently borrowed the files beld by Mrs. Wecker; the results of

thie check revealed the details of ALMUSICAL's reporting en his cone
tacts with SULMAN, insofar as such details are reflected in the TIDRAMA
operational files, and are summarised in Emctosure A. --. -

$. It is obvious from even a relatively superficial review of theee
materials, that AEMUSICAL has never bees questioned in detail by his
CIA case efficere on hio relattonship with or te SUMAN and a number of
othor individuals, whose names appear throughout this correspondence.
either doce he appear to have been debricfed in depth on the substance
of the information he passed to the Sovicts on auch poraons during the
individual meetings he had with the KGB, much lese regarding the
reactica of the KGB handler to any of the names, or the follow-up
querice put to him by the Soviet Case Cificer orally during the course
of any particular meeting whon such information was passed. This
statement, of course, is based upon tho operational reporting prepared
by the Case Officer| and is obviouely subject to poosible
ecorrectica in she event ouch details are covored in tho individual cone
tact reports prepared after cach meeting by the CIA handler, such
Feporto nct having becn scanned or read in the course cf thie review,
Unless sech dotails do appear in the contact reports, it would appoar
that eourre has withheld much of the detail af his conversations with
bdo Soviet handler, either ca a uitting basis the motivation for which
must be eotsblished, or unwittingly, poosibly because he-was not asked
for these details, Under the circumstances, you may wish to consider
undertaking a thorcugh GL review of the entire AEMUSICAL case, in
Order thet a detailed debriefing of the agent may be undertaken upon
bie return to the United Stateo, and prior te hie re-traasfer te the con-
trot of tha FSI. We noto that despite indications to the field that the
desk was proparing-traces on AZMUSICAL's multitadinous contacts,
the files reviewed reflect the rasulte of such iracing efforts on oaly a
small propertion of the agent's associates and contacts.

6. It io requested that the writer be kept advised of aay further
action contemplated in thia case, ae well as of any further information
developed about source's contact with SUMAN or any other persons.

* depth to which KGB representatty:

ENCLOSURE A

Reconstructed Chronology of KGB Knowledge of Michael C. BUMAN'S
Connection with AKMUSIGAL and «ith ZAGRACE- principale:

1, Per CSCI-3/760, 672, dated 12 July 1960, addressed to the
FBI, on poge Al thers is mentioned « “general questioning by SLABOV
of AEMUGICAL with regard to hie contacte in the U.S, during the
meeting between SLASOV and AEMUSICAL on 5 ay 1959, It must
be presumed that SUMAN's name likely came up at thia time, -in Hgbt
of information developed at a later date showing 5UMAN (to have been
the person wko exerted the most influence over AZMUSICAL ia his
youth, according to ALMUSICAL's own admission.

2. At the 16 July 1959 meeting with SLABOV, his KGB handler,
AEMUSICAL was instructed by SLAECV to prepara and submit to
SLABOY at the next meeting a “very complete Uife history’ of himeeli.
(cf para. 9, OSSA-BB61é, dtd 24 July 1959} According to the same
reference, the CIA Case Cificer, Timothy F. Noggle met with
AZMUSICAL oa 17 July, at which time he obtained the above info, aad
in para 17 tho CIA handler states:

“17, We gave T/1 the green light on his life history telling
hira to furnish a complete.and truthful report to. TIDRAMA/3.:
The portent of T/3's ‘high-level’ schome lor T/lic hard to deduce
and harder yet to accopt at face value. For the time being it
soeimns dest to maintain our wait-and-seo policy, particularly
Because the Sovict trip should produce:s Girm.decieion on the
Soviet side as to whether or not T/ is worth all thie bother,..."

Stace the next AEMUSICAL (then still TIORAMA/1) contact with the
KGB was ochedoled:for'3 August 1959, to be followed by a meeting with
Noggle on 6 August, it must be presumed that at lcast at thie time
AEMUSICAL's close friendship and continuing contact with Michael C,
SUMAN was brought to the attention of the KGB. However, it 1a note-
worthy that throughout the operation, there is very little detailed
reporting from the field on the exact details of what AKMUSICAL told
the KGB handicr at each meeting regarding each of his personal con-
tacts. Subject's case is a perfect example. Actually there is no
@etaited record of exactly when or what AEMUSICAL told the KGB
about hia friendship with Subject, cthor than the items contained in

this chronology. Neither does there appear to be any reporting of the
probed into thie relationship, the
reaction shown by the KGB handler whon ALMUSICAL first indicated he



agape ret Ea gio evinee

was a friend of SUMAN's, ete, Since ACEMUSICAL (then TIDRAMA)
actually was in contact with the KGB Resident in stockholm, Ivan
BORISOV in 1957 prior to bis contact with KU BARK through the local
ODACID installation, there always remains the possibility that SUMAN
may in some-yet unexplained manner have played seme role in BORISOV'’s
contact with ASMUSICAL of which source either is wiiting but to which
he does not admit, or of which the agent ia entirely wawitting.

3, CSCI-3/756, 896 addressed te the FBI under date of 9.Ccteber
1939 page 5, para 5, indicates that TIDRAMA did in fact provide
SLABGV with the requosted detailed personal biographic Metory otate-
mont, such information presumably having been passed, as planned,
on 3 August 1959. Lf SUMAN's name had not previously come up in the
oval queotioning of AEMUSICAL referred to in para t, above, it curely
faust have come out on this occasion.

4. Ineomoch as SLABOV requested AEMUSICAL to provide bim
with an address at which he could be reached while in the U.S. in the
fall of 1959, although the record indicates merely that he thereupon
Guppiied SLABOV with bis mother’s addrese in Califozaia, in view of
the laformation reported to hie headquarters handlers in Cetober 1959
prior to leaving Washington, it must bo presumed that ALMUSAL
also provided SUMAN's name and address to the KGB, os one of the
persons he planned to contact and vieit with while in the U.S.

5. WE/L and the FBI were aware, .in-advance, of TIDRAMA's
plans to cantact SUMAN while on the West:Coaet duriag (he period
27 Ceteber through 5 November 1959, according to the original plane,
28 indicated in attached memorandum dated 29 October 1959, addressed
by WE/1 to Mr. Milor of Cl/Cps/Soveat, (incl. D) The original ofthis
decument was found interiiléd in tha TIDRAMA Operational Files held
by SR/CL/RER, :

6.- Following TIDRAMA's retura from above referenced Woot
Coast trip in October-November 1954, during which time he was ~
attempting to obtain certain classified information from bis California
Contacts in order to comply with the KGB requirements gives him by
SLABCY before he left Stockholm, TIDRAMA was again debriefed and
briefed by the headquortere case officers of WE/1, with report of his
U.S. trip forwarded to the field as OSSW-6379, under date of 13 November
1959. Apparently this pouch wae not.coordinated with Mr. Miler, and
it {s apparent that no copies of the complete pouch were provided to him
following dispatch to the ficld, in light of various memoranda referring
to OSSW -6379, all of which are addressed to C1/Upe Sovest and begin
with a memo dated 9 August 1960 concerning SUMAN. Copies of these

trary to the impression conveyed in Amidon's memorandum-of 9'Auguat’
2960, 3 clossz reading-of OSSW-6379 reveals that his visit with 5U MAN
eccupled the entire period of bis otay in Celifornia, t.@. from 27 Ceteber
through & November 1959, to the exciucton even of visiting the Inyokera
Raval Station where Source's rsother was employed, and concerning”
which he held certain Sil'o from the Soviet case officer, Undor the
elreumstances, hie contact with SUMAN cannot be dismisoced as lightly
as Amidon's memo might indicate, and it is very doubtful that TIDR AMA
would have"been able to get off with ac superficial e report to his KGB
handler as ho appoare to have donc with reapect to the WE/1 case
officers responsible for his handling at the time,

7%. As Enclosure G, please find a copy of the report TIDRAMA
propared on his contacts in Callfornta, which was prepared by the Deek
aad paosed te Mr,| for clearance by appropriate U.S, Agencies
for pasooge. This me ndum wae made available to this office by
Mr.[- uring the week of 30 Cctober 1961, The memorandum

tion was.ahown te the PBI on that date, and subsequertly returned on
3 December 1959, Please note SUMAN's name fo included.

6. According to Mr, Granquist's memo to Mrs, Potockh, (cf.
Enel, B) there-allogedty Is no further mention of SUMAN tn the
TIDBAMA/AEMUSICAL {ite othar than that forwarded by Granquist
with hie note, and the report forwarded to us with referenced memo-
rondum,

9. Following disappearance from tha United States of MARTIN
and MITCHELL tn July 1960, ead after initicl request for asaistance
from this Agency, NSA made availablein early August 1960 photocopies
d tho PHS forme completed by MARTIN and MITCHELL for omployment
with NSA, euch forme being dated 11 July 1957, three days after they
feported for duty at Fort Mieade, Zxamination of MARTIN‘ employ-
mont application revealed that he had listed Michael C. SUMAN of
Slorra Madre, Californa, oa a personal reference in one case, and as
& credit referonce in another place, indicating that he had known him
for a period of four years, i.e. since 1953, However, inasmuch as
thore was no Indication that SUMAN had been connectod in any way
with MARTIN's military sorvice in Japan, it was assumed that SUMAN
wae a casual acquaintance and not an intimate friend,
