MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Liaison
FROM : SR/CUR

SUBJECT : Questions Concerning Defectors
Joseph J. DUTKANICZ (201-289236) and
Vladimir O, SLOBODA (201-287527)

1. DUTKANICZ's Army assignment at time of defection.

USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2 (copy attached) confirms
DUTKANIC2Z's assignment to the 32nd Signal Battalion in Darmetadt.
However, his wife indicated that he had CIC connections, In an interview
at the American Embassy Moscow on § December 1961 (cited in DBA-288,

24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain "had
been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was allowed
to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do." There are also penciled no-
tations in the 201 file suggesting that his Army assignment may have included

intelligence functions of some kind.

2. Previous KGB Connection of both defectors. ae

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ himself
told American Embassy officials in Moscow that he had been approached by
KGB representatives in a bar near Darmatadt in 1958 and had accepted
recruitment as a result of their threats and inducements. He claimed to
have given them minimum ceoperation from then until his defection, although
the Army considered it probable that he had dene more thin he admitted. A
farther indication of his KGB involvement before defection is the fact that the
special decree granting him Soviet citizenship was enacted three months before
his arrival in the USSR; see Emb tel 831.
