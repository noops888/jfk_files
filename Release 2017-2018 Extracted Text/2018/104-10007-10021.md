at the American Embassy Moscow on 5. December 1961 (cited in DBA-388,

24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain "had

been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was allowed

to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do. " There are also penciled no-

tations in the 201 file suggesting that his Army assignment may have included

Intelligence functions of some kind.

have given them minimum cooperation from then until his defection, although

the Army considered il probable that he had done more thin he admitted. A

further indication of his KCB involvement before defection is the fact that the
