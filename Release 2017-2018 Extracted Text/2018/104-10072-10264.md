FRONT OF THE ESCAMERAY (SEGUNDO FRENTE DEL ESCAMERAYO SANE).

THESE LEADERS WERE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THEIR PERSONAL AVOI

TIONS TO HEAD AN EXILE COVERNMENT AND WERE NOP PREPARED TO SUB-

MERGE THEIR INTERESTS IN A SUFFICIENTLY EROAD REPRESENTATION.

IN LESTAD'S VIEW, AN EXILE GOVERNMENT MUST MAVE THE SUPPORT OF A

BROAD MAJORITY OF THE EXILES AND ITS LEADERS SHOULD BE MEN WHOSE

NAMES WOULD COMMAND RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF

ELEMENTS WITHIN THE PRESENT CASTRO REGIME WHO MIGHT BE INDUCED TO...

OVERTHROW CASTRO. THE ESSENTIAL FURPOSE OF SUCH AN EXILE GOVERN-

MENT WAS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE

A REBELLION INSIDE CUBA. LEITAO SAID IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOSTER

DIFFERENCES AMONG THE GROUPS IN THE CASTRO REGIME UNTIL THESE

DIFERENCES ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE.

Z. LEIYAO SAID THAT CARLOS MARQUEZ STERLING WAS TOO CLOSELY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOLITICAL INTERESTS OF BATISTA. FOR EXAMPLE

MARQUEZ MENTIONED EUSEBIO MUAL DARNIOL, LABOR LEADER UNDER

CATISTA, GUILLERIO BELT, FORMER AMDASSADOR TO WASHINGTON UNDER

BATISTA, AND JOSE ELEUTERIO PEDRAZAO

FORMER BATISTA AFTAY OFFICER,

AS FRINCIPAL FIGURES OF HIS PROFOSED GOVERNMENT. LEUTAO REMARIED

IN A SARCASTIC VEIN THAT SUCH NAMES WOULD HARDLY INSPIRE CONFIDENCE

IN THE ELEMENTS INSIDE CUBA UFON WHOM THE EXILES WOULD HAVE TO

DEPEND FOR THE OVERTHROW OF CASTRO.

3O LEITAO SAID CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS WAS THE BEST QUALIFIED

AMONG THE LEADERS WHO HAD TALKED TO HIM BUT THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL

WAS NOT CERTAIN PRIO COULD OBTAIN WIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT.

L. LENTAO MENTIONED ERIEFLY THAY ME HAD TALMED TO RAMOLE RAY,

WHO HAD APPEARED WELL ADJUSTED BUT STILL BELIEVED HE COULD CARRY

OUT RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES WITHIN CUBA, WHICH LEITAO BELIEVED

C IMPOSSIBLE IN VIEW OF THE TERROR AND TIGHT SECURITY MEASURES EMPLOYED

P

BY THE CASTRO REGIME. ANDRES NAZARIU SARGENT ALSO TALKED TO LEITAO..

Y

NAZARIO'S THINKING WAS QUITE SIMILAR TO RAY'S.

5. ON 21 DECEMBER 1964 ANDRES NAZARIO SARGENT SAID ME TALKED

TO VASCO LEITAO DA CUNHA IN. WASHINGTON ON 2S0 DECEMBER. NAZARIO

SAID HE VISITED LEITAO AT THE REQUEST OF LEITAO'S WIFE WHO SAID HER

SOCARRAS. NAZARIO REPLIED THAT THE SNE OFFICIALS WERE AGAINST THE

IDEA. LEITAO REMARKED THAT HE EXPECTED SUCH A REPLY AND THAT HE

HIMSELF WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF IT.
