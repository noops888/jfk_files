CONFIDENTIAL ‘Tacape-s15/oc0se-Gae aa 2
VRONT OF THE EScAMBRAY {SEGUNDO FRENTE DEL ESCAMBRAY, SFNE). ;

THESE LEADERS WERE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THEIR PERSONAL AMBI-

TIONS TO HEAD AN EXILE GOVERMENT ARO WERE KOT PREPARED YO SUB-

MERGE THEIR INTERESTS IN A SUFFICIENTLY BROAD REPRESENTAT IONe

: IN LELTAO'S VIEW, AN EXILE GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A

BROAD MAJORITY OF THE EXILES AND {75 LEADERS SHOULD BE MEN WHOSE
NAMES WOULD COMMAND RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE’ ON THE PART OF
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE PRESENT CASTRO REGIME WHO MIGHT BE IROUCED TO

. OVERTHROW CASTRO. THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF SUCH AN EXILE GOVERN=
MENT WAS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE
A REBELLION INSIDE CUBA. LEITAO SAID IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOSTER ee
DIFFERENCES AMONG THE GROUPS IN THE CASTRO REGIME UNTIL THESE et

DIFERENCES ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE.

‘ 2. LEITAO SAID THAT CARLOS MARQUEZ STERLING WAS TOO CLOSELY
ASSOCIATED WITH THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF BATISTA. FOR EXAMPLE
UARQUEZ MENTIONED EUSEBIO HUJAL BARWIOL, LABOR LEADER UNDER

| GATISTA, GUILLERMO GELT, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO’ WASHINGTON UNDER
BATISTA, AND JOSE ELEUTERIO PEDRAZA, FORMER BATISTA ARMY OFFICER,
AS PRINCIPAL FIGURES OF HIS PROPOSED “GOVERNMENT. LEETAO REMARKED
IN A SARCASTIC VEIN THAT SUCH WAMES WOULD HARDLY INSPIRE CONFIDENCE
IN THE CLEMENTS INSIDE CUBA UPON WHOM THE EXILES WOULD HAVE TO
DEPEND FOR THE OVERTHROW OF CASTRO-

3. LEITAO SAID CARLOS FRIO SOCARRAS WAS THE BEST QUALIFIED
AMONG THE LEADERS WHO HAD TALKED To HM BUT THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL



I: = [ ——
TO OBTAIN A BROAD REPRESENTATION FOR AN EXILE GOVERNMENT AND HE
WAS NOT CERTAIN PRIO COULD OBTAIN WIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT.

Uh. LENTAO MENTIONED GRIEFLY THAT HE HAD TALKED TorMANOLS RAY,
VO HAD APPEARED WELL ADJUSTED GUT STILL BELIEVED HE COULD CARRY
OUT RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES WITHIN CUBA, WHICH LEITAO BELIEVED
ingossie.e IN VIEW OF THE TERROR AND TIGHT SECURITY MEASURES EMPLOYED
“BY THE CASTRO REGIME. ANDRES NAZARIU SARGENT ALSO TALKED TO LEITAQ,

\
NAZARIO'S THINKING WAS QUITE SJMILAR TO RAY'S. |
“5. ON 21 DECEMBER 1964¥ANDRES NAZARIO SARGENT SAID HE TALKED ;
TO VASCO LEITAO DA CUNHA IN. WASHINGTON ON 29 DECEMBER. NAZARIO |
SAID HE VISITED LEITAO AT THE REQUEST OF LEITAO'S WIFE WHO SAID HER t
KUSGAND WANTED TO TALK TO HIM. LEITAO ASKED NAZARIO WHAT ELOY i
GUTIERREZ MENOYO, MILITARY LEADER OF “THE SFNE, AND OTHER SFNE
OFFICIALS THOUGHT OF THE EXILE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED BY CARLOS PRIO
SOCARRAS. NAZARIO REPLIED THAT THE SFNE OFFICIALS WERE AGAINST THE
IDEA. LEITAO REMARKED THAT HE EXPECTED SUCH 4 REPLY AND THAT HE es

HIMSELF WAS NOT‘IN FAVOR OF IT.
