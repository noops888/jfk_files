On 8/24/67, Mr. CARL M. HAUN, Station Superin-

tendent, British West Indian

furnished the names of individuals who would possibly be

knowledgeable concerning Guyana.

Among them was that of

subject and the fact he was connected with KIMEX, an import-

export firm.

On 3/18/68, CHARLES LUDWIG, 1901 South Miami Avenue,

Miami, advised he knew GOODMAN and knew of no derogatory

information concerning him. LUDWIG, who is in the shrimp

business, advised GOODMAN had a good reputation in the Miami

area but

he did not know if GOODMAN visited Guyana and Surinam

with any regularity.

On 6/25/68, LEONARD R. POMEROY, pilot, 341 Grand

Canal Drive,

GOODMAN for at least

20 jears and had worked for GOODMAN and leased planes from

him.

He described GOODMAN as a manof fine reputation.

stated that although he, POMEROY, had had a misunderstanding

with GOODMAN on one occasion, he felt GOODMAN was an honest

man and would recommend him as such.

In fact, after POMEROY

had demanded $200.00 which POMEROY claimed GOODMAN owed him;

GOODMAN paid rather than argue.

POMEROY stated that he had

since thought about It and felt that GOODMAN was probably

right about not owing POMEROY the money in the first instance.

POMEROY stated that GOODMAN has a good family life and is a

stable individual.

POMEROY has never discussed politics

with GOODMAN but regards GOODMAN as a loyal American citizen.

On 7/23/68, ALLEN S. YARBROUGH, Border Patrolman,

Miami, Torida,

advised he had been in the same Air Force

Reserve unit with GOODMAN. He stated that he was cognizant

of the information contained in GOODMAN's file in the Border

Patrol office but stated he knew of nothing derogatory

concerning GOODMAN as an American citizen.

He advised

GOODMAN was one of that special breed of pilots who know

what they can do and what they cannot do concerning violations

of the laws of the United States.

However, he was of the

belief that GOODMAN would not commit such

an offense whereby

he would be or could be openly charged with violations of

the laws of the United States. As far as GOODMAN's loyalty.

a person of fine character

and loyalty.

On 7/23/68, MISS JEAN DEL MANZO, secretary,

Border Patrol Office, Miami, made available a file on the

following:

E. VAN

DIVER, Customs Agent, disclosed GOODMAN was under

investigation concerning his purchase of a B-25 plane from

one

BROWER Who was known for neutrality violations and

other

Craminal activities.

The report reflected that the

aircraft

was purchased by United Americas Export and Import

Company

on 6/27/60 for 56, 500, one-half cash and the balance

to be paild within one year.

This company, was composed of

He had been

employed previously as chief pilot for Argonaut Airlines

and chief test pilot for Air International.

CRAIG WILLIAMS, manager of Air International, had

stated GOODMAN was a person of excellent character and

felt the corporation above was a legitimate enterprise and

HENRY GOODMAN would not attempt to illegally export the B-25

plane, #NS. 3482 G.

at Floridian Plant Varms,

and approached SUGARMAN as a potential buyer of an interest

in their company, United Americas Import-Export Corporation.

They suggested that SUGARMAN could get multi-engine commercial

and instrument ratings on the B-25. GOODMAN said that with

his instruction, SUGARMAN would be able to co-pilot the

aircraft and be

an active partner. They mentioned

huge

profits they were making in buying, selling and transporting

animals and plants.

154, 200 for a lo per cent interest in the firm.

SUGARMAN paid them

On 12/30/59, LESSLIE was doing maintenance on an

aircraft and later with SUGARMAN loaded eight 50-gallon drums

of fuel in the bomb bay compartment, which LESSLIE said was

to be used on the return trip because it was cheaper than

buying fuel in Iquitos,

Peru, their destination.

Several

refrigerators were loaded aboard, which LESSLIE said had

: been sold in advance of the trip. LESSLIE said this was

legal.

That evening,

a Swedish fellow joined SUGARMAN

and GOODMAN on the trip. The Swedish fellow told SUGARMAN

that he had agreed to supply GOODMAN with orchid plants in

several weeks for immediate transportation. When the plane

took off, it began an unusual vibration. GOODMAN took a

flashlight and saw the wind pulling the

cowling open because

ol loose Leus tasteners.

GOODMAN got clearance to land and

later berated LESSLIE for his carelessness in maintenance.

The cowling was fastened by LESSLIE and the plane again took

off.

When they were airborne, GOODMAN gave the controls

to SUGARMAN to hold. Later, he turned the navigation lights

and the beacon off, stating they would be over Cuba in a

few minutes and the State Department forbid flying over

Cuba.

Therefore, they would go with the lights off. This

conserved fuel, according to GOODMAN.

In a little while, they were over land, at which

time GOODMAN called Havana and gave their position as west

of Cuba when actually they were east of Havana.

When they landed in Panama, GOODMAN gave SUGARMAN

money to purchase liquor and told him to be sure to get the •

crew discount.

The liquor was later delivered to the

ramp, along with some liquor which GOODMAN, himself, had

purchased.

After unloading the fuel in Iquitos, Peru, ano

prior to loading the cargo, GOODMAN placed this liquor in

the lower front portion of the bomb bay compartment. Cargo

was then placed on top.

In Iquitos, they had specific orders with cash

deposits for most of

the tropical fish and animals that

were purchased.

They returned to Miami via Aruba when SUGARMAN

asked about the legality of flying over Cuba and was told

it saved fuel. SUGARMAN was also told it was legal to take.

cash deposits on orders and when SUGARMAN voiced objection,

GOODMAN said they would not fly over Cuba again.

Two weeks later, SUGARNAN was told he could not go

along on the trip since GOODMAN said LESSLIE and another

individual had to go along and they had more experience in

purchasing fish.

About three weeks later, they

scheduled another

trip to Iquitos.

That evening, CHARLES MOORE, an AP mechanic,

said the left engine did not sound right. The trip was

GOODMAN decided it was not bad fh

go along on the trip "for services rendered."

GOODMAN

roceeded over Cuba and by mistake landed at Guantanam

Naval Station.

GOODMAN told SUGARMAN to keep quiet an

did for the next two hours.

When they returned to Miami, LESSLIE and GOODMAN

said SUGARMAN was giving them "too much static."

They

refused to let him go along on the next trip.

When SUGARMAN

told them to give him his money back, they said he had his

"stock" which he had purchased.

SUGARMAN summarized the following items, stating

that GOODMAN was a menace on or off the airways:

(1) flying

at night without lights; (2) doing heavy maintenance himself;

(3) knowingly flying in restricted areas; (4) hauling cargo

commercially in a noncertified aircraft; (5) hauling passengers

for hire in a restricted aircraft; (6) using an aircraft to

bring liquor into the country without declaring it to Customs

and paying duty on it.

SUGARMAN advised the aircraft registration was

NS 3482 G and stated GOODMAN's address was 7840 S. W. 125th

Avenue, Miami.

Attempts were made to locate and contact WALTER H.

LESSLEY, above, with negative results.

On 7/26/68, LEONARD H. THORNTON, Counselor, FAA,

Miami, advised that GOODMAN had come to his attention approx-

imately one year ago in connection with a possible violation

of FAA rules concerning his operational certificate for

piloting a B-25 airplane.' GOODMAN's certificate permits him

to carry his own goods but he may not haul freight for other

people.

However, it was determined through GOODMAN's attorney

that GOODMAN owned the goods he was hauling in connection

with the complaint that had been received by that agency

against GOODMAN. Nothing came of the matter.

Subject has no local arrest record. He has a

favorable credit record.

An FD-9 submitted 1/30/68

and place of birth, description and Air Force serial numbers),

the Identification

Division was unable to identify GOODMAN

in either the criminal or civil files.

ReWFOlet to the Bureau dated 3/27/68.

On 4/11/68, records of the Office of Security,

United States Department of State (USDS), were reviewed by

SA ROBERT M. EGAN. These records revealed that the USDS had

directed a communication to its Miami Office on 8/11/60 which

C

communication USDS advised USDS, Miami, that the United States

Customs Office was inyestigating GOODMAN concerning his purchase

of the B-25 from ED BROWDER, who has a notorious reputation for

past neutrality violations and other criminal activities.

According to this communication, no derogatory information

has been developed concerning GOODMAN. Also in this communication

it is stated that the Border Patrol had no derogatory information

concerning GOODMAN and both agencies have no objection to issuance

of a "SOJ" permit.

In addition, these records contained a USDS memorandum

dated 9/14/62. This memorandum refers to a copy of a letter

dated 7/29/62 from a HAROLD SUGARMAN, 68 Alden Avenue, Valley

allegations concerning HENRY GOODMAN's flying activities.

From the memorandum it could not be determined whether this

letter was being forwarded by the USDS to its Miami Office,

or vice versa; however, there was no copy of this letter in

the file.

This memorandum also makes reference to a report

of the Miami Office of the USDS dated 7/27/60, captioned

"B-25 N8090H-Exportation to Argentina". It was not con-

tained in this file. In addition, this memorandum indicated

that the Federal Aviation Agency, Miami, is presently processing

violations against HENRY GOODMAN and his B-25 which violations

apparently are for infractions of civil air regulations.

This file contains no additional information con-

cerning HENRY GOODMAN.

It is noted that HAROLD SUGARMAN, referred to above,

is apparently identical with the SUGARMAN

who accompanied the

subject on subject's B-25 landing in Cuba which information

was set forth in referenced WO letter.

On 4/11/68, records of the Passport Office, USDS, ;

were reviewed by SA ROBERT M. EGAN.

These records indicated

boss that HENRY RUDOLPH SOODMAN, born 8/6/21 at New York, New York,

last applied for a passport at Miami, Florida, on 1/22/65.

At this time he listed his residence as 7840 S. W. 125th Street,

Miami, Florida, and his occupation was given as airline trans-

portation pilot. His spouse was identified as ANNA ELIZABETH

ABOWMAN, born on 5/3/21 at Elizabeth, New Jersey. They were

married on 8/25/46 (place not specified).

In this application GOODMAN's parents were identified

asLESTER

GOODMAN, date of birth unknown, and MINNAHILGEMAN, Good Man

born 10/31/96 at New York, New York. He indicated purpose of

ser

the passport was to visit various countries of the Western

Hemisphere in connection with his occupation as an airline

pilot. On 1/22/65, GOODMAN was issued passport F068079.

He is described in this application as six feet two inches,

grey-brown hair, hazel eyes with a scar above his left eye.

In addition, these records showed that GOODMAN previously had

passport number 1673730 which had been issued on 10/21/59.

At this time he held the same occupation and resided at the

same address as listed above. He indicated that the purpose

of the passport would be to allow him to travel to various

countries throughout the Western Hemisphere to ferry air

craft.

In addition, these records indicated that on 10/29/53

GOODMAN had been issued passport 222279. At that time he

resided at the above address and his occupation was given as

airplane pilot for the Continental Charter Air Craft, Miami,

Florida. Other background information is as above.

In addition, a notation in this file indicated that

in January of 1959, GOODMAN resided at 956 Palmetto, Miami

Springs, Florida, and worked for the International American

Air Ways, Miami, Florida.

These records contained no additional pertinent

information.

On 4/17/68, Mr. GEORGE DANE, Chief, Investigations

Branch, Federal Aviation Agency, advised that he was unable

to locate any record at the Federal Aviation Agency for

GOODMAN. He indicated that possibly the Civil Aeronautics

poard might have conducted investigations concerning this

subject if it involved civil air regulations.

WFO is presently having the records checked at

the Civil Aeronautics Board and Customs Office for any

information concerning the subject.
