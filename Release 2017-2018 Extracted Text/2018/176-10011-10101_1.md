Through clandestine agent sources, we learned recently.

that a Western European merchant ship en route from Havana, Cuba,

to Odessa,

USSR, would be forced to dock at a Caribbean port and

off-load temporarily part of its cargo in order to repair minor hull

damage which resulted from an accidental grounding. It was ascer-

tained that this vessel carried as cargo 80; 000 two-hundred pound

bags of Cuban raw sugar shipped to Odessa, USSR, for i

refining in

the Soviet Union. In order to lighten the ship sufficiently to permit

repairs, it was necessary to off-load and temporarily warehouse

14, 000 of the two-hundred pound bags of sugar.
