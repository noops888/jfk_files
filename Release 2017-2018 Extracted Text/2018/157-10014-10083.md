Mr. Johnston, Now, let me ask you. sr. Rocca, who followde
you with the Kennedy case, dates his involvement as about Janua

Me. Sceleo, That is possible. The. turning point came

when I finished an initial report on the case and distributed

it to the people who were concerned within the Agency. °

Mr. Johnston. How large was that report? ~

Mr. Scelso, oh, dt might have been 20 pages long,.-and
Summarized all of the things which we had discovered abroad.

Just at the time that this report was being finished and was

being circulated, Mr. Nicholas Katzenbach noti*

that the PBI or Department ef Justice report on the case was”
finished, and invited the Agency to send representatives “to
read it in his office.

I would like to add that in the initial phase of the
investigation, when I was commissioned with the job, Mr. Helms
called me and Mr. Karamessines and Mr. Angleton and a number of

others into his office ‘and told them in the clearast terms

“possible that I was to be in charge of the investigation, that

no one in the Agency was to have any conversations with anyone
outside the Agency, including the Warren Commission ana the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, concerning the Kennedy assassi4 -
nation without my being present. I was to be told and given an
Opportunity to go to everything.

I did talk to members of the Warren Commission. I an

certain,’ although I cannot prove it, that Mr. Angleton throuy

the entire period discussed the Kennedy assassination regulari;
with PBZ representatives, never notified me of any of these
meetings, and never passed on to me any of the information thar
he yained in these meetings.

The Bureau did send us, during tais initial period --

Senator SChweiker. Now, wait a minute.

FBI representative, the liaison officer to us, Mr. Sam Papich.
These meetings were held in Mr. Angleton’s office.

The FBX did send us hundreds of reports of niscellaneous
people during this period, fost of ison were by the: very nature
of things not even involved in the case, but reading Katzenbach 3
report I for the first time learned that the FBI was in
possession of diary-like material which Oswald had had in his
possession and was found after the assassination.

ft learned for the first time that Oswald was the man whe

had taken a pot shot at General Edwin Walker, two key facts in

the encire case. All the ballistic evicence was there, and

countless other pieces of information. None of this had ever

been passed to us.
Senator Schweiker. What timeframe was that that you saw

this report, roughly?

Mc. Sceiso. I saw the report as soon as it was finish:
according to Mr. Katzenbach, and my recollection was that 1t
was around Christmas of 1963.

Senator Schweiker. And you had at that point completed
your initial report or not?

Me. Sceiso. We had completed an initial report based ©:

everything we had learned up to that tine. It was not to

a final report. It was” an initial report.

Scelso. ‘the FBI report Tay. have ‘been two'volumes. I
can only recall one, but it may have been a volume of exhibits
or something iike that.

Mr. Wallach. And your report was a 20 page report?

Senator Schweiker. Twenty page? I don’t think we've
seen it.

Mr. Scelso, A 20 page report.

Mr. Wallach. Copies to whoni?

Mr. Scelso. Copies to Nr. Helms, Mr. Angleton, I think
Mr. Murphy, the Chief of the Soviet Branch, of the Soviet
pivision, and possibly others, possibly to the Director.

Mx, Wallach. Was there a title?

Mr. Scelso. it summarized ~~ there was nothing in thar

report which was not in the material that you have.

Senator Senweiker. I was going to say was there anyt

significant in the report in retrospect that sticks out now
in view of what we know now that might be helpful to us?

Mr. Scelso. fothing, nothing. In fact, mich, much

is now known than I was able to put in that report, obvious...

Mr. Scelso. “No. ‘gust ‘tha fact that he had been ‘there,
because we knew next to nothing about it. see, we had.in our
possession -- I had in my possession at that time only the
fragmentary information which we had gotten at the time from
the Navy Department when it was realized that Oswald had
defected.

Senator SChweiker. Did the report deal, for example.
with the polygraph test that was yiven to Alvarado?

Mr. Seeiso. Yes, I think so, yes. :

Senator Schweiker. The person who alleged that there was
a $6300 payoff?

he, Seelso. Yes, yes, I am sure it mentioned that. It
mentioned the Alvarado case. Whether it mentioned the fact
tnae he had been polygraphed, 3 don't recall.

Senator Schweiker. Was he, do you recal}, was, he
polygrapned according to your recollection?

Mr. Scelso. He was definitely polygraphed by a polyy

operator by the Office of Security of cur organization.

Mr, Sceldo. “Yes. ”

Mr. Scelso.' In Mexico City.

Senator Schweiker. .And were the results, according to the

best of your ‘récollection; conclusive or not?”
Mx, Scelso, Tile results were unclear.
‘Senator Schweiker. werd what?
Mr. Scalso. Unclear.
I might add, Senator, that I was the first polygraph’
operator in the Central Intelligence Agency, and that I knew
and still probably do know a great deal about the polygraph.
our Office of Security took over the polygraph business
several years after I got into it and tookkit over exclusivel,.
See, I was an operations officer in the espionage and
counterespionage business, and was trained on the side as a
polygraph operator.
Senator SChweiker.

So you were quite familiar with the

polygraph.

I was very faiiliar with it, and I can

you rignt now, one of my beefs over the decades was that the :

repolygraph important agent personnel who had been polygraphed
by Office of Security men over and over again and had beaten
the polygraph, and t had'to tak 4 v . ‘

and get them to confeass Tt happened ‘on

in very, very major cases, and I just felt at the tima Alvarado
was polygraphed that the man that they sent down there -- I don
remember hig name but I know him -- just bungled the job
completely.

Senator Schweiker. And so when you say the results of the
polygraph test was unclear, in your mind it was. unclear becaus.:
it was poorly administered?

Mr. Scelso. Poorly administered, yes.

Senator Schweiker. So you really couldn't conclude whethe
he was lying or telling you the truth from that.

Mr. Scelso. From the polygraph, no. The operator, Q
believe, came out and said he really couldn't tell whether tx
man was telling the truth or not.

Hr. Johnston. Is it difficult, te polygraph Lutin areri-

Mr. Scelso. Mo, It is difficult cto polygraph fabricate:

just did not know how to polygraph fabricators, and I’ could
explain to you why they didn't and how you shoald polygraph
fabricators, -

Senator Schweiker, Well, let me ask a more layman's

question.

in view of the polygraph test being unclear, what kind of

conclusion or analysis’ did you put in your 20 page report as
to the authenticity or not authenticity or lack of authenticiz,
of Alvzrado's testimony?

Mr. Scelso. I and my staff came to the conclusion that

Alvarado was a fabricator.

Senator Schweiker. Now, why did you do that in view o
test being unclear?

wr. Scelso. Well, Alvarado confessed to Mexican authorit.4..
later that he had fabricated this.

Senator Schweiker. Was any of oir personnel, CIA or
Fbi, there when he did this? |

Mr. Scelso. No, but we talked to

Me, Scelso. I don't thing that we knew. ran pretty sure
we didn't. We had never heard of Alvarado before he popped
up in this case, and the Nicaraguans came to us either in
Mexico City or in Nicaragua. .

Senator Schweiker, weil: we-saw ‘sone report = aha maybe
this will help refresh Your memory, maybe it was an PBI report
saying that ~- I thought it said that CIA had used him in the
past and be was 80 percent reliable, whatever that means.

Mr. Johnston. Let me clear that Up. The confusion is the
deletions in the Far report. The true face was that he was
an informant for Nicaraguan intelligence, and they suid he
was £0 percent reliable. Nicaraguan intelligence told cra
that-he was 0 percent reliable.

Senator Schweiker. He was not our informant.

Mx. Johnston. He was not oar informant.

Senator Schweiker. I'm sorry...

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Now, here again I am relying exclusively on ay recolty

obviously had been in this building and in the courtyard of it
because he could describe it. That was part of his miasion,

He reported regularly to his Nicaraguan case Sfficers in

Mexico City about what he was doing. After ‘the Kennédy

. 88sassination became news, public news, Alvarado went to his

Nicaraguan contacts and told them that back in October ef that
year he had been in the Cuban consulate, I believe, and had
there sean Lee Harvey Oswald, whose picture by that time had
been on television in Mexico, and had sean him in conversation
with a group of people, among them a red-headed Negro, and

had boasted that all of them were too cowardly to carry out
Some mission but that he would do it. And a sum of money was

mentioned -~ I don't remember the sum of Money. Was it
$3000?

Mr. Johnston, $6500.

Mr. Scelso. "$6500, something like that, some $3000 stuck
in my menory.

But this puzzled us until 1 think we learned from our
Station in Mexico City that Mexican radio stations had broace:.
among the nuadreds of facts and nonfacts that they were putias

desire addressee stations screen carefully all audio tapes
since 22 November 1963 for conments and cable any significant

indeed the President's approving it. That was the tone of
everyone's conversation.

Mr. Johnston, Do you, when you said the knowledge of the
fact that the Agency had engaged in plots to assassinate. -
Castro might have affected your attitudes --

Mr. Scelso. It would have cranked other factors, you
see, into our reasoning process: I don't think, however, in

for the overthrow of Castro, possibly including Castro's
assassination, had the highest U.S. support, would that have

name of the Cuban that they were meeting with onmNovember 22:2

attention either.

Mr, Scelso, Well, it did not come to mine, and I gather
from conversations I have had with colleagues, retired colleaguys,
here in Washington and with Mr. Phillips and what Ihave read
in the papera, that Helms was knowledgeable of all of this, and
undoubtedly Helms, with whom I kept in very close touch
throughout this investigation -- it was pretty much a one-way
street it seems now -- probably was analyzing this 24 hours @
day.

Senator Schweiker. I'11 buy that pretty well

Mr. Wallach. Do you know if Helms or anyone else was
conducting an investigation separate and apart from yours cf
the assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr. Scelso. No. I would be pretty ~- as sure as 1

was not.

Mr. Johnston. Could he have conducted one through SAS

that you would not have kncwn about?

Nr. Scelso. itardly. it nad so many friends in SAs, !

of the tremendous flow of information back and forth, the ta:
that cables were misrouted and pecple get to see cables

Mr. Scelso. Yes, find out all the details about it.

Mr. Johnston. Would you have been interested in whether
er not the agent took the poison pen that was offered him?

Mr. Scelso. Indeed.

Mr. Wallach. Would you also, having become aware of this,
asked senior CIA officials, maybe Mr. Helms in particular, abo.
other assassination attempts that we have documented such a:
the CIA's use of the Mafia against Castro? I mean, you woud
have gone into a new area?

Mr. Scelso, I would definitely have wanted to know aj?
about that.

Panamanians, among their other cultural developments, have
copied this from the Swiss, although why anybody would trust
a Panamanian bank with his money I don't-know, and this man,
this Department of Justice official asked us -~ and someone

Mr. Wallach. Let me ‘ask you this question, sir.
Did the CIA conduct an investigation to determine whether

ox not there was Cuban involvement in the assassination of

President Kennedy? . Te

Mr. Scelso. Yes, to the extent that yéu could eee it on
the record, we did analyze and investigate Oswald's connections
with the Cubans in New Orleans and in Mexico City.

Mr. Wallach. Forgetting, for a second, Let Harvey Oswald,
you talkedi:tbefore about if you had known of certain facts that
we have discussed here, you would have sent out different
operational leads or requested different operations.

Mr, Scelso. Yes.

Mx, Wallach. I think there is a distinction between
retracing Oswald and his possible contacts, and conducting an
investigation to determine if a country,,a foreiyn country was

involved in the assassination of one of our Presidents.

How, going to the latter point, was such an investiga

conducted that you know of by the CLA?

Mr. Scelso. Well, here We are yettiny down to fine po:
of semantics. I still insist that -~ of course, you can see
the Central Intelligence Agency did issue erders to go over ~

Senator Schweiker. Why wouldn't Oswald's photograph have

Mr. Scelso.

Simply because these people operating, these

Mr. Scelso. Well, Kostikov was put under surveillance at

guess you know now that our Mexico station was the most
elaborately equipped and effective in the counterintelligence
field of any we had in the world, and they went on to this

Mz. Johnston. “Hy ‘question ‘ a he fact
that while you were involved, did you have a feeling or a
sense that there was a major effort to determine whether the
Soviets were somehow behind Oswald?

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Hr. Johnston. Did you have an equal sense of an effort
to determine whether the Cubans were hehind Oswald?

Mr.

Scelso, No, not a corresponding effort.

Mr. Johnston. And is that in part due to the fact that
Mr. Angleton was such a strong personality and dominant in tne
Agency?.

Mr. Scelso, Well, in the early stages Mr. Angleton vas
not able to influence the course of the investigation, which
was a source of great bitterness to him. He was extremely

embittered that I was entrusted with the investigation and

wasn't. I was equally embittered because I had plenty to do

anyway, although I was proud of having the assignment. Ang

Katzenbach's report, and I said wy report is obviously usele:

I suggest that the Soviet angles of this case be followed up

request.
You see, with the ‘peceipt of the FBI report with: the

vast amount of information about Oswald's activities in the

United States, including shooting at General Walker, the

ballistics evidence, the opening up of all of his activities
in the Soviet Union, this scope of the investigationwwas far
greater than I could handle from ay position as chief of this
branch in the Western Hemisphere Division. I felt that I hac

very satisfactorily investigated the Mexican aspects of it,

handled all of the other worldwide aspects of it in the time
that we had had, being ignorant, as I was, of our attempts to
knock off Castro, aid I was quite happy to get out of it.

one ef the reasons that Helms gave me the case in the

place was that Angleton was su clout “0

Mr, Scelso. This was a theoretical possibility. In othe:
words, we knew right off that the FSI had been in touch with
Oswald because we got requiar ~~. :the FBI sent: us copies of ai:
of their reports on people ‘that might be of interest to us,
including Oswaid, and masses of‘stuff. These reports had not
come to my desk before the assassination, you see, or perhaps
they had because,.of-course, we knew Oswald had been in “Mexico. |
Maybe we did get it, but I know they never came across my desk
personally. And we knew, of course, that an FBI special age:
was meeting Oswald at infrequent intervals to find cut how
he was doing and so on.

Therefore, there was a possibility that in some way, she
or form, the FBI might have been derelict or culpable or
something lixe that, and of course, we never developed anythi:.
like that.

Mr. Wallach, Did you ever have any discussions with any

about why the facts you have labeled as significant in that

report when Kavzenuach showed you the FBI

port, were neve

prought to your attention at any earlier date?

Mr. Scelso. I mentioned it to Nelms, and I wentionee :

Senator Schweiker. A sexual relationship.

Mr. Johnston. And the’ Dorticos ana Arnis’ telephone cali,
there was a question’ of whet er tha’ Mexican police’ taikea and
asked Duran about having aexual relations with Oswald. In 1967
for some reason, Silvia Duran said publicly, or-at least
through a source, that she had had sexual relations with Oswald
while he was there,

Mr. Scelso. I draw a complete blank on that. I certainly,
think I would remember if it had been alleged, or we had

believed there was any substance to it.

Senator Schweiker. The other question on the list was, +

Oswald ever travel to Cuba from Mexico City?

Do you know why that question might have been put on the
list, and does that refresh your memory about any possibile
trip that Oswald made to Cuba? ;

Mr. Scelso. We wold have asked the Mexicans that sO.
that they would check their records to see if he had gone
frois Mexico to Cuba. This was because of some hanky panky. <2
actually had passenger Lists on everybody who went through
other sources of ours, but these sources were not run jointly,
with the Mexican government. So Win Scott was probably

it might have had. The Mexicans were always -- the Cubans

were always shooting people in and out of the country in strang

ways. Whe link from Havana to Mexico City by air was at that

time the only air connection that Cuba had to the Western
Hemisphere. And countless people, important foreigners, neus~ ,

paper people, Mexican government officials, went in and out H

through this way, and the Cubans often made attempts to conc
who they were. We were watching them like hawks and kepe

Mr. Johnston. And for me I just want to clarify the
significance of that point, and that is that you had or you werd
privy to something that was at that time as sensitive ag the
mail operation, , -
; Mr. Scelso. Yes. I was speci ficaliy == you had to be

specially briefed on it.

Mr. Johnston. But you were not privy to the assassination
plots,

Mr. Scelso. No,

Senator Schweiker, Well, we want to thank you very muci.
You have certainly been very straightforward and very coopern-
tive.

Mx. Scelso. I would like to add something if I may,
Senator.

it -- when: the Donindean, erisis:broke, I at that. time, my
branch, because of my outstanding work, had expanded until i
had the entire Caribbean, except for Cuba, thrown into my
branch. It was the largest geographical branch in the Agency.
Because of the landing of the American troops and so on, we

set up a war room adjacent to our communications center, and

we had our own teletypes and wa had charts on the wall, and

were sitting around there. And you may remember that at that tfc

the Central Intelligence Agency had uncovered some 50 or 60
Communist trained saboteurs and agents who had been infiltracu
back into the Dominican Republic by the Cubans under aliases
in order to kick off a revolution. Somebody waved the flag.

#y chance, some military nuts started a revolution
prematurely because of petty grievances, and these Communists
came out of the woodwork and took over the revolution. They
just came out of their hiding places and took @verything over
and had everything organized, and it was a very danyerous
situation,

average officers of the Central Intelligence Agency to an order
to commit assassinations.

And that would have been my reaction if I had been mixed
up in this Castro business. ;

Senator Schweiker. Well, we certainly appreciate knowing
this, and it is very heipful to us to get a balanced perspective
of the situation.

But you really have been most helpful to us I think in
terms of what you had available to you at the time. You have
shed as much light as anybody on exactly what did happen an:
how it happened, and what happened, and we certainly appreciat
it very much.

And thank you for coming in.

Cuban operations were opened up to usilater on,

My impression was at the time of the Kennedy assassination
was that we did not have any vecy lagu aed eeuives ln th.

Mr. Wallach. Let me ask you whether or not at any time
after you left that assignment, handling the investigation for
‘the CIA, you had any contact at all with the investigation
again? :

meetings in the White House. TE have heard him talk about ther

Mr. Wallach. More specifically, did you ever hear any

discussion as to whether the President was annoyed at Mr.

Helms for not telling him about assassination plots?

and I'm very glad to come back. ,

I am very, very dismayed and shocked in the Agency's
involvement in some of these activities, it is so reprehensible
and unforgivable.
