Mr. Scelso.

The DDP was Mr. Helms.

I might add that all statements I make in this matter

are based on purely my memory, because I had little or no

contact with the oswald investigation, the kennedy Investigation

after the end of 1963, and I have not reviowed any records at

all except the few documents which you showed me this mornina.

Senator Schweiker. Was this because of a transfer of

duty or assignment of what?

MI. Scelso.

It was because the investigation was turnes

over to another staff in the Agency, to the Counterintelligere:

Staff. I can explain why it was turned over in much more

detail if you'd like.

Senator Schweiker. Well, maybe briefly, if you would.

MI. Scelso. I was put in charge of the investigation in

the first place because of the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald

had been in Mexico, and the foreign entanglements seemed to

center there. Also, I was put in charge of it because I na:.

Mr. Johnston. Now, let me ask you. MI. Rocca, who followiu

you with the Kennedy case, dates his involvement as about January

23rd, 1964.

Mr. Scelso. That is possible. The turning point came

when I finished an initial report on the case and distributed

It to the people who were concerned within the Agency.

Mr. Johnston. How large was that report?.

Mr. Scelso. Oh, it might have been 20 pages long, and

summarized all of the things which we had discovered abroad.

Just at the time that this report was being finished and was

being circulated, Mr. Nicholas Katzenbach notified the igo:.

that the FBI OI Department of Justice report on the case was

finished, and invited the Agency to send representatives"to

read it in his office.

I would like to add that in the initial phase of the

Investigation, when I was commissioned with the job, MI. Kelms

called me and Mr. Karamessines

and Mr. Angleton and a number of

others into his office and told them in the clearest terms

possible that I was to be in charge of the investigation, that

no one in the Agency was to have any conversations with anyone

outside the Agency, including the Warren Commission and the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, concerning the Kennedy assassi-

nation without my being present. I was to be told and given an

opportunity to go to everything.

I did talk to members of the Warren Commission. I am

certain, although I cannot prove it, that Mr. Angleton througie

the entire period

discussed the Kennedy assassination regularli

with tBI representatives, never notified me of any of these

meetings, and never passed on

to me any of the information that

he sained in these meetings.

The Bureau did send us, duriny this initial period --

Mr. Seelso. well, Mr. Angleton was the Chief of the

Counterintelligence Staff and had almost daily meetings with the

FBI representative, the liaison officer to us, Mt. Sam Papich.

These meetings were held in MI. Angleton's office.

The fBI did send us hundreds of reports of miscellaneous

people during this period, most of whon were by the very nature

of things not even involved in the case, but reading Katzenbach's

report I for the first time learned that the FBI was in

possession of diary-ilke material which Oswald had had in his

possession and was found after the assassination.

I learned for the first time that Oswald was the man wic

had taken a pot shot at General Edwin Walker, two key facts

i1:

the entire case. All the ballistic evidence was there, and

countless ocher pieces of information. one of this had evur

been passed to us.

Senator Schweiker, What timeframe was that that you saw

this report, roughly?

Mr. Scelso. I saw

Mr. Scelso. No. Just the fact that he had been there,

because we knew next to nothing about it. See, we had.in our

possession - I had in my possession at that time only the

fragmentary information which we had gotten at the time from

the Navy Department when it was realized that Oswald had

defected.

Senator SChweiker. Did the report deal, for example,

with the polygraph test that was given to Alvarado?

MI. Scelso. Yes, I think so, yes.

Senator Schweiker. The person who alleged that there was

a $6500 payoff?

Mr. Scelso. Yes, yes, I am sure it mentioned that. It

mentioned the Alvarado case.

Whether it mentioned the fact

that he had been polygraphed, : don't recall.

In very, very major cases, and I just felt at the time Alvarado

was polygraphed that the man that they sent down there - I don't

Senator Schweiker. And so when you say the results of the

polygraph test was unclear, in your mind it was unclear becaus::

it was poorly administered?

Mr. Scelso.

Poorly administered, yes.

Senator Schweiker. So you really couldn't conclude whethe

he was lying or telling you the truth from that.

I was the only polygraph operator but for one

who was trained by Leonard Keeler, the inventor and developer

of the polygraph. Most of the others, I think, were trained

by a bunch of charlatans who succeeded him. Our Security peoplu

just did not know how to polygraph fabricators, and I could

explain to you why they didn't and how you should polygraph

Senator Schweiker. Well, let me ask a more layman's

question.

In view of the polygraph test being unclear, what kind of

conclusion or analysis did you put in your 20 page report is

to the authenticity or not authenticity or lack of authentici::

of Alvarado's testimony?

Mr. Scelso. I and my staff came to the conclusion that

Alvarado was a fabricator.

Senator Schweiker. Now, why did you do that in view of ti

test being unclear?

Mr. Scelso. Well, Alvarado confessed to Mexican authorit.

later that he had fabricated this.

Sonator Schweiker. Was any of on: personnel, CIA or

MI. Scelso. I don't think that we knew. I am pretty sure

we didn't. We had never heard of Alvarado before he popped

up in this case, and the Nicaraguans came to us either in

Mexico City or in Nicaragua.

Senator Schweiker. Well, we saw some report and maybe

this will help refresh your memory, maybe it was an FBI report

saying that - I thought it said that CIA had used him in the

past and he was

80 percent reliable, whatever that means.

Mr. Johnston. Let me clear that up. The confusion is the

deletions in the FBI report. The true fact was that he was

an informant for Nicaraguan intelligence, and they suid he

was 80 percent reliable. Nicaraguan intelligence told CIA

that he was 80 percent reliable.

Senator Schweiker. He was not our infurmant.

Mr. Johnston. He was not oûr informant.

posing as a dissident Nicaraguan, and he frequented the Cuban

embassy and consulate, trying to get a visa to go to cuba. He

obviously had been in this building and in the courtyard of it

because he could describe it. That was part of his mission.

He reported regularly to his Nicaraguan case officers in

Mexico City about what he was doing. After the Kennedy

assassination became news, public news, Altarado went to his

Nicaraguan contacts and told them

that back in October of that

year he had been in the Cuban consulate, I believe, and had

there sean Lee Harvey Oswald, whose picture by that time had

been on television in Mexico, and had scon him

in conversation

with a group of people, among them a rei-headed Negro, and

nad boasted that all of

them were too covardly to carry out

some mission but that he would do it. And a sum of money was

mentioned - I don't remember the sun of money. Was it

$ 3000?

Mr. Johnston.

$6500.

MI. Scelso.

$6500, something

like that, some $3000 stuci:

In my menory.

But this puzzled us until I think ve learned from our

station in Mexico City that Mexican radio stations had broacr...:

amony the hundreds of facts and nonfacts that they were puerr

out about the Kennedy assassination,

had mentioned or had

stacement that Oswald had been discovered to have a savings

account in Texas with this amount of money in it.

Now, the fictithat oswald' a picture, had seen on television,

the fact that this amount of money had been mentioned on the

radio, and the face that this Nicaraguan source, Alvarado»

had not reported this incident in any way, shape, or form, back

An October when he had allegedly seen this occurrence in the

Cuban consulate, but had only come up with this after the

Kennedy assassination..

Senator Schwelker. In other words, he didn't report it

to his intelligence service when it occurred.

MI. Scelso. No, he didn't.

MI. Johnston. Just let me clear one fact up for the

record. His report was that he saw Oswald on September 19th.

not in October.

Mr. Scelso. Yes, something like that.

Mr. Johnston. And I reviewed the record, and I just want

to be clear that one of the reasons CIA had for discounting nis

story was the FBI information that Oswald was in New Orleans c..

September 19th.

Ms. Scelso. That's right, that's right. That comes baci:

to me non.

Mr:

wallach. Let's go off the record for a minute.

(Discussion off the recorá.)

Senator Schweiker. Excuse

me. Now, you were explainii:

to me why jou felt, in spite of the incomplete results, why

you discounted Alvarado.

Senator Schwelker. Well, I would expect that.

Mr. Scelso. Which shook him up.

To me, in my judgment, and as an interrogator of some

tens of thousands of German prisoners of Horld War II.- and

a lot of them were fabricators, and a polygraph operator who

had tested some thousands of people and uncovered guite a bit

of fabrication in the early years before we cleaned our payrol:

of such people, I felt that I was very confident that Alvarica

nad made up the story based on his knowledge of

the appearansi.

the inside appearance of the Cuban consulate in Mexico, his

knowledge of what their employees looked like and the type oi

people that went in and out of the place, and the fact that hu

was a trained intelligence agent; trained in reporting,

enabled him to fake up an interesting-sounding, semi-plausibi:

report.

I did know that in the course of our operations we were

landing armed agents on the coast of Cuba from time to time,

although I was not privy to these operations, and I do know

that either then or afterward in that time, historical span,

Fidel Castro used to allege, Cuban propaganda used to allege

that we were sending agents ashore to kill Castoo. To my

knowledge at that time and to my later knowledge wher. I was

in a higher capacity in the Agency and reviewed all of the

Agency's clardestine oporations regularly, I did knon that

were sending in paramilitary groups attempting to place ajen..

abroad to do all kinds of things, but not that they attempte:

or that we were going to kidnap Castro.

And it would be impossible in an Agency like our own,

because you couldn't do anything like that without leims or

everyone's conversation.

fact that the Agency had engaged in plots to assassinate.:

Castro might have affected your attitudes ..

Ms. Scelso. I certainly think that that-would have been

become an absolutely vital factor in analyzing the events

surrounding the Kennedy assassination.

Mi. Johnston. If I add to that the fact that on October

29th, 1963 Mr. Fitzgerald met with this Cuban and

assured hir

as a personal representative of Bobby Kennedy that his scheme

for the overthrow of Castro, possibly Including Castro's

assassination, had the highest U.s. support, would that have

been a major fact?

Mr. Scelso. It certainly would.

MI. Johnston. And let me add to it, the reason I asked

you about the name traces that are on Mexico cable 7045, the

name of the Cuban that they were meeting with onnvovember 22:a

is included in this cable, and that a name trace on him, if

conducted, as you say, would have led to his file which

indicated the meeting and the assassination plot.

Senator Schweiker. And it also might have indicated

well, this is very debatable, but it might have indicated wier?

question.

Mr. Scelso, Yeah.

Mr. Wallach. I take it you would also not be aware of

the fact that the FBI through its informants learned about this

operation.

Mi. Scelso. I knew nothing about it.

MI. Johnston, Given - did you assume that Oswald might

be pro-Castro?

Mr. Scelso. Oh, yes.

MI. Johnston.

And did you assume or did you speculate

that the Cuban government might have been behind the assassi

nation?

MI. Scelso. We weighed this possibility, and at the

stage at which I turned over the investigation to Mr. Rocca,

on Mr. Angleton's staff, my inclingtion was still to reject

that possibility.

However, just at the time that I was turning it over. :

But at that time I was turning the thing over, and I might add

that at that time I had the Panama riots of January 1964 on

my hande, and plenty of other things. I was still running my

MI. Johnston. At the time you were conducting your

Investigation, was it brought to your attention, the fact tha?

Castro had talked to an AP reportor by the name of Daniel

Harker on September 7, 1963, and threatened to eliminate or

said that U.S. leaders who were trying to eliminate. him and

that he threatened retaliation?

Mr. Scelso. I think that did come to our actention.

Or it came to my

Mo. Scelso, Well, it did not come to mine, and I gather

from conversationg I have had with colleagues, retired colleaguts,

here in Washington and with Mr. Phillips and what I have read

in the papers, that Helms was knowledgeable of all of this, and

undoubtedly Helms, with whom I kept in very close touch

throughout this investigation - it was pretty much a one-way

street it seems now - probably was analyzing this 24 hours a

day .

Senator Schweiker. I'll buy that pretty well.

Mr. Wallach. Do you know if llelms or anyone else was

conducting an investigation separate and apart from yours ci

the assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr. Scelso. No. I would be pretty . as sure as l

Department of Justice to talk to a high official who was in

charge of the anti_ racketeering squad.: I don"t remember the

man's name but he was and still is a well-known public figure.

Mr. Wallach.. Was it Herbert Miller?

Mr. Scelso. No. It was an Irishman, I remember, a

young fellow, a young Irishman who was a crony of Bobby. Kennedy

and was trying to run down the Mafia and the Las Vegas gamblers

were what we were working on at that time, and it had been

discovered that these Las Vegas gamblers were smuggling cash,

which they skimned off the top of their daily take, to

Panama and putting it in numbered bank accounts, which

Panamanians, among their other cultural developments, have

copied this from the Swiss, although why anybody would trust

a Panamanian bank with his money I don't.know, and this man.

this Department of Justice official asked

Did the CIA conduct an investigation to determine whether

or not there was Cuban involvement in the assassination of

President Kennedy?

Mr. Scelso. Yes, to the extent that you could see it on

the record, we did analyze and investigate Oswald's connections

with the Cubans in New Orleans and in Mexico City.

MI. Wallach. Forgetting, for a second, Let Harvey Oswald,

we have discussed here, you would have sent out different

operational leads of requested different operations.

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Wallach. I think there is a distinction between

retracing oswald and his possible contacts, and conducting ai

investigation to determine if a country. a foreiyn country was

involved in the assassination of one of our Presidents.

How, going to the latter point, was such an invostigati....

Soviets were somehow behind Oswald?

Me. Scelso. Yes.

dir. Johnston. Did you have an equal sense

of an effort

to determine whether the Cubans were behind Oswald?

Mr. Scelso. No, not a corresponding effort.

Mr. Johnston. Arid is that in part due to the fact that

Mr. Angleton was such a strong personality and dominant in the

Agency?

Mr. Scelso. Well, in the early stages Mi. Angleton kas

not able to influence the course of the investigation, which

was a source of great bitterness to him. He was extrenely

einbittered that I was entrusted with the investigation and i:

wasn't. I was equally embittered because

that he realized thas it would soflect very prarly on the Agency

and very poorly on him, and that it might indeed turn out that

the cubans had undertaken this assassination as retailation for

our operations to assassinate Castro, this would have a

disastrous effect on him and the Agency, I think those are the

obvious human explanations, plus the fact I think Mr. Helms,

knowing me, would have had some concern about my reaction to th

revelation because he knewwhat kind of person I was.

How was the investigation explained to you in terms of

what the FBI was doing, what the CIA was doing, just your

told me in the presence of these others that I was in charge

of the investigation, that everybody was to feed all informa:.

hold any meeting with anjbody else outside of the agency on

Te to my understanding

that

the CIA is not a law enforcement agency.

Did Mr. Helms at any time discuss with you what allowed

him to ask that anninvestigation be conducted?

Mr.. Scelso.: No, that wasn't really necessary because I

was thoroughly fanillar with the ground rules affecting our

operations internally and externally. He had in our area,

my area, countless operations targeting on Americans which

were worked out elaborately within the ground rules. Helms

was very, very flem on his insistence, which came up from

time to tine, that we do not operate

against Americans outriu.:

of the United States unless we are specifically requested to

by some other Government agency which is empowered to do so.

MI. Wallach. I think somehow my question has been mis-

stated.

We have been told by persons familiar with Cuban activili:

there, including people at the JMWAVE station, that it was

their belief, whether they were told of not, that this.

investiyation was within the ambit of tie FbI, and that they

were not investiyating the assassination of President jennce:

You see, with the receipt of the FBI report with the

vast amount of information about Oswald's activities In the

United States, including shooting at General Walker, the

ballistics evidence, the opening up of all of his activities

in the Soviet Union, this scope of the investigation was fai

greater than I could handle from my position as chief of thi:

branch in the Western Hemisphere Division. I felt that I has

very satisfactorily investigated the Mexican aspects of it, iu:

handled all of the other worldwide aspects of it in the time

that we had had, being ignorant, as I was, of our attempts ti

knoci off Castro, arid I was quite happy to get out of it.

Oswald because we got regular -.:the FBI sent us copies of ai:

of their reports on people that might be of interest to us.

including Oswald, and masses of'stuff. These reports had not

come to my desk before the assassination, you see, or perhaps

they had because,.of course, we knew Oswald had been in Mexico.

Maybe we did get it, but I know they never came across my desi.

personally. And we knew, of course, that an FBI special aye::

was meeting Oswald at infrequent intervals to find out how

he was doing and so on.

Therefore, there was a possibility that in some way, she.

or form, the FBI might have been derelict or culpabie or

it might have had. The Mexicans were always -- the Cubans

were always shooting people in and out of the country in strange

way's. The link fron Havana to Mexico City by air was at that

tine the only air connection that Cuba had to the Western

border having been closed the afternoon of the 22nd, that he

arrived in Mexico City on November 25th, and departed as the

only passenger on a. late evening flight to Havana, and that the

Mexicans reported to CIA that he looked, "suspicious" accordi:;

President Kennedy was in Tampa on the lßth of November. On.

the 20th of November, Lopex applied for and received an entry

crossing the border at Nuevo Laredo on November 23rd, apparentl

set up a wai room adjacent to our communications center, anc

we had our own teletypes and we had charts on the wall, and

were sitting around there. And you may remember that at that

the Central Intelligence Agency had uncovered some 50 or 60

Communist trained saboteurs and agents who had been infiltras:

back int o the Dominican Republic by the Culians under aliases

in order to kick off a revolution. Somebody waved the flag.

By chance, some military nuts started a revolution

prematurely because of petty grievances,

and these Communists

came out of the woodwork and took over the revolution. They

just came out of their hiding places and took everything over

and had everything organized, and it was a very danyerous

situation..

U.si troops set up a periphery around the city of Santo

ioringo, and nobody could go in di out of the city without

being checked. Just at this time dier Director of Central

Intelligence took over, and 1 rojres having to mention his naur

it has Admiral Raborn, a man wich no previous intelligence

exjerience, and an outstanding loval oificer - and during che

first hours of his tenure as Director of Central Intelligence,

came into our war room where I, Mr. Phillips and four or five

other people who had been on our feet for days and days and

days, were reeling around in a groggy state, and we showed him

our maps of Santo Domingo and described where the Communist

headquarters were and what they were doing, and he said to us

there was no shooting going on at that time, everything had

quieted down. There was some aniping occasionally. And

Raborn said, obviously. not realizing what he was saying, all

right, I want you to send teams in by sea and knock those

guys off.

And for the second time that day, Helms stepped between

me and kaborn with his back to me so

I would: 't be able to

say what I was about to say, and kaborn was a very positive

fellow, so he left.

Present at this scene was a member of our paramilitary

staff at the Agency and they set up a war room and they blew

up photographs of Santo Domingo almost as big as: that wall,

they had eierything on it, and after

This was the normal reaction of

average officers of the Central Intelligence Agency to an order

to commit assassinations.

And that would have been my reaction if I had been mixes

Senator Schweiker.

Well, we certainly appreciate knowing

this, and it is very helpful to us to get a balanced perspective

of the situation.

terns of what you had available to you at the time. You ha:

it very much.

And thank you for coming in.

HI. Wallach. We have a couple of more questions.

(Discussion off the record.)

(Senator Schweiker left the heariny room.)

Mr. Johnston, We have just a couple of more questions.

Mr. Johnston. I don't have any more questions.

I want to thank you very much for coming back for this.

Mr. scelso, Hell, you know, I don't do anything anyway,

and I"m very glad to come back.

I am very, very dismayed and shocked in the Agency's

involvement in some of these activities, it is so reprehensible

and unforgivable.
