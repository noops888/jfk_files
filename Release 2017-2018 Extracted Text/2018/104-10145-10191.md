MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Meeting with Mr. (Herbert Manel1)

1. Yesterday afternoon I met with Mr. (Manell) in the

company of Messrs. Shepanek and Holmess?

• The purpose of the

meeting was to ascertain Mr. Manell's recollection of cer-

tain events in Mexico City in connection with the visit of

Lee Harvey Oswald there.

I told Mr Manell the questior

that had arisen over the memoires of Win Scott.

2.

While Mr.(Manell)has not read the Scott memoires,

he said that he could offer speculation on how Scott came

to write such a thing.o≥Mr. Scott at times was "prone to

exaggeration." Manell) said that Oswald's visit came at

the end of the summer.

The summer was a period when lots

of "kooks" came to Mexico and contacted the Soviet Embassy.

•S Manell said that

this proved to be very time consuming

from the Station's point of view as the Station was obliged

to report to Headquarters and appropriate Embassy components

on these people when they were identified.

He considered

this function to be one of "no profit" operationally,

although it was of course a necessary Cl responsibility.

When Oswald identified himself in a telephone call

less instance of one more probable useless contact to

cable. No one thought much of Oswald, and Win Scott signed

off on the cable without question.

4.

On the question of photographic coverage he said

there is a practical explanation of why there were no

photographs of Oswald.

He said the work was very boring.

He believes that the Mexicans were simply not photographing

Following the assassination of President Kennedy,

recalds a number of Agency personnel listening t

radio broadcasts.

Then the name of Oswald occurred. hi:

first reaction was, "My God, that's the man I reported on."

Someone else may have responded similarly but he recalls

that as his reaction.

This led to a cable to Headquarters.

Speaking in a rather all-inclusive way he said

that there

no photographs of Oswald there then, so

there were none to burn or destroy afterwards.

7. (Manell)mentioned the fact that the HSCA people

pressed him on why Tom Karamessines had signed off on a

communication for a name trace.

He could not understand

Holmes told him that the

the cable, which required the next highest person's

release. Manell) clearly had not thought of that,

He reported later that his wife had nothing addi-

it to him before putting

it into

final form, which was done.
