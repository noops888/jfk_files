MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Lee Harvey OSWALD

At 1010 hours on 3 December, Mr. Papich of the FBI advised that the

Bureau had received a cable last night from the Legal Attache in

Mexico City who is in touch with our representative there. He stated

that our representative had been Informed by Captain Wheelock of the

Nicaraguan Intelligence Service thatyALVARADO told him, Wheelock, that

he recanted his original story because of fear of physical harm; that

Alvarado was being deported from Mexico to Nicaragua on 4 December 1963

and would be accompanied by Wheelock; that Wheelock assured our repre-

sentative that Alvarado would be available for further interview in

Nicaragua if the United States desired.

Mr. Papich stated that the Bureau would like to have him subjected

to a polygraph examination by this Agency and would appreciate receiving

word as soon as possible as to whether we will handle the matter since

If we will not handle it the FBI will have to determine what other steps

might be taken to see that this is done. I advised Mr. Papich that I

would check into the matter, that I did not know whether we had available

at this time a polygraph operator who could properly handle this matter

but in any event I would let him know whether this can be done.
