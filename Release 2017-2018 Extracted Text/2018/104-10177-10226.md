COS. met with a representative of LNERGO on 22 November 1972

in an attempt to clarify the confusing issue over ANDESK-l as outlined in

reference A.

The substance of LNERGO's remarks are as follows:

LNERGO afcertained from conversations with AMDESK-1 that the latter

, had been

some time during the summer of early fall of 1972

on

business.

During his visit

AMDESK contacted

his old friend CIRASH-6. In the course of this contäct, CIRASH-6

evidenced an interest in re-establishing contact with BKHERALD

Subsequently, AMDESK-l, through the good offices of his

superior

arranged this contact which eventually took place.

LNFRGO. has since been advised by AMDESK-1 that he (AMDESK-1) did not.

accompany CIRASH-6

2. The problem, therefore, appears to be that AMDESK-l, for

reasons not clear to us. reported to LNAGON that he ard an unidentified

high ranking

had been|

together, and he (AMDESK-1) met with a BKHERALD officer. LNERGO

mentioned that they have always found AMDESK-1 honest and objective,

but there is always the possibility that he could have misrepresented the

information he passed to 'LNAGON, perhaps to gir some advantage for

himself with that service. In any event, LNERGO prefers not to pursue the

matter further with AMDESK-l as they are reluctant to become involved in
