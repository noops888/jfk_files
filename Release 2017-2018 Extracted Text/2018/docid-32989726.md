MR. PIKE'S POSITION on the report of his House

intelligence committee is, in brief, untenable. He agreed

last September i• accepting certain classified in-

formation from the Executive branch that the White

House would be the final arbiter of what part of it would

be disclosed. To claim t'at his pledge applied to the

receipt of information then but not to the reporting of it

now is to make a mockery of his pledge and to undermine

the basis on which any future intelligence oversight

committee could ask for confidential information. That

the information at issue describes "atrocious and

horrendous things," in Chairman Pike's charac-

terization, does not dissive is obligation to keep his

word. Nor is it a suitable alibi that much of the in-

formation had leaked already. That merely raises the

question of whether the Pike committee was living up to

its obligation to maintain confidentiality in the period

before the release of the final report became an issue..

Fortunately, the Rules Committee was of a mind to

preserve the integrity of the House by holding up release

of the report until the full House had acted on it. And the

House followed suit last night by voting overwhelmingly

to delay disclosure. Mr. Pike has insisted that he would

release the full report or no report at all. We cannot

believe, however, that the House will be guided by his

stubbornness in the matter. Enough has leaked from the

report to establish that there is much of legitimate public

value in the sections of it likely to be approved by the

President. Chairman Pike's cry of "cover-up" will only

become reality if he is allowed to make it so.

• The whole episode in fact underlines the difficulties of

countenancing and controlling a secret agency in a

democraci-even an agency whose ostensible purpose is

to protect that democracy. Mr. Pike, not alone. went at

the intelligence establishment determined to root out the

abuses of secret power which had transpired over the

years.

Those abuses

were real and frightening, em-

periling not only the liberties of American citizens but, in

the now

?

some cases, the very security which the agencies were

meant to uphold. It is true, too, that to the extent that

power continues to be wielded unaccountably, there can

be no firm guarantee that it will not again be abused. It is

a fair question whether the costs of secrecy outweigh the

claimed benefits, which in the best of circumstances are

likely to be difficult to confirm. Mir. Pike has no corner on

honest concern.

The opposite risk is. of course. that too little weight will

be given to the "fact" that the world remains a menacing

place and that it would be tempting fate to go over to an

open security system which would deny the country and,

within it, the Executive branch the flexibility needed to

cope with what the President and his advisers perceive to

be grave national threats. This is, we think, the trap into

which Mr. Pike has fallen. Disclosure of the particular

secrets which he would now like to tell may or may not be

as harmful as the administration claims. The point is,

nonetheless, that the right to conduct some national

security affairs in secrecy must be upheld.

There can be no congressional oversight unless the

President takes the Congress into his confidence. But the

Congress cannot take the Congress into his confidence if

secrets are to be betrayed. Just how oversight should be

conducted and to what extent Congress should be em-

powered to veto operations which its overseers disap-

proved are questions being addressed in the proposals

for reform offered yesterday, for instance, by a majority

of the Senate intelligence committee. We intend to return

to these and other such proposals. It there is not a

modicum of mutual confidence and

trust between the

Executive and Congress, however, it becomes foolish

even to consider reform. The security of the country and

the liberty of its citizens can best be pursued-we are

tempted to say, can only be effectively pursued-when

there is respect for the procedures agreed on between the

two branches. That is why it is so important for both of

them to keep the agreements they do manage to work out

with each okae

Kissinger Contempt

Threat Now Fading

After Compromise

By Norman Kempster

Washington Star Staff-Writer

Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis,, said. today

the has received indications, that the

White House will permit the House

Intelligence Committee to examine

the documents involved in the panel's

dispute

with Secretary of

State

Henry A. Kissinger.

Aspin, a member of the commit-

tee, said the informal agreement

apparently will provide the commit-

tee with the information it is seeking

without the committee's pressing a

contempt

Congress citation

against Kissinger.

Aspin told, reporters that Chairman

Otis G. Pike,, D-N.Y., has agreed not

to seek a House vote on the Kissinger

contempt citation without giving the

committee an opportunity to reverse

its 10-2 vote charging the secretary.

with defying a subpoena,

ASPIN, WHO has been working

behind the scenes to head off a con-

trontation with Kissinger, said that if

Pike had not agreed to delay he was

prepared to make a formal motion to:

postpone action. Aspin predicted his

motion would have won on a 9-4 vote;

Aspin, said if the committee ac-

cepts the White House's informal:

proposal,

the documents could be

examined only at the White House

and would not be surrendered to the 1

dommittee.

for instance, that it was not a

REP. OTIS G. PIKE (D.N.Y,), a

man who chooses his words carefully,

sat down in the blue-curtained studio of

the House radio-TV. gallery and

of accusing the Ford administration of

The Pike committee began public

hearings back in August witha. lookat

extremely. limited. Then, last month,

the House members, started digging

into the "results" of the billions of

It:was, therefore, somethingof asur-

that the hearings on the quality of

American spy work were virtually at

voiced pride in the Church panel's

by the executive, one-high-ranking.in-

"We'vebeen getting

IT IS, at best, a limited yiew.of what

Congressional hearings should strive

to achieve.

(R-Tenn.),, the only member of the

Senate panel who also served on the

Dellums Charges

Office Bugged

Suspects FBI

By Norman Kemoster

Washington Star Stalf Wrier

Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.,

said today he discovered an electron-

ic eavesdropping device on the tele

phone in his district office which he

believes was placed there by the

FBI.

Dellums, a member of the House

Intelligence Committee, related thei

story of the bug as the committee

was conducting a public -hearing into

illegal wiretapping by law enforce-

ment agencies and private organiza:

Ations.

Dellums said he

discovered. the

eavesdropping device in 1912 but lad

not previously told the story in public

because he was attempting to deal|

with the matter privately,

BUT HE SAID that even a member

of Congress apparently has no re-

course against illegal wiretapping.

a single joint committee of both houses of Congress

For the Record

Reprinted from the Sun howell,

Mass.)::

Hearings before the House ethics

committee into the leaks: of informa.

*tion from the House intelligence com

mittee to CBS. newsman Daniel Schorr

have been revealing. One thing they

have revealed is that the intelligence

committee had apout as much, talent

rIor keeping secrets as a Holiywood gos-

sip columnist. The committee's own

counsel, James Cliphunt, said the panel

did not follow proper

security rules

during the time it was investigating the:

•country's intelligence agencies.

been answered. " According to Oli

phant, top secret material was kept in

indiviqua desks and some was even du:

plicated on office machines. so. start

members could have copies of their

own. The more important question is

how capable the committee was to do

the job'it undertook,

The thought of a House panel carry-

ing out:investigations into the most se

cret functions, of national security

agencies in such a slipshod manner is

scary: Certainly with this kind of opera-

tion nothing will be kept secret for

yery long, and the Schorr incident may

have done the country areal service in

exposing such peer procedure.

From the beginning. we telt that the

investigators were looking in the

wrong place in blaming Schorr for the

leaks. The fault is'in the committee.it

self and that is where plame Saould be

placed.

National security is too important. to

be handled so poorly. The intelligence

committee, which has criticized many

others, now is indicted itself.

White House

Held Lax With

Spy Report

Unauthorized Access

Rampant, Hill Aide Says

United Press Interuational

The staff director of the House

Intelligence Committee has testified

that unauthorized White House per-

sonnel, among many others, had ac-

cess to the supposedly secret intelli-

gence report that eventually leaked

to the press.

"I know of friends in the White

House who had absolutely nothing to

do with intelligence who saw it,"

A.

Searle Fleid told House investigators

yesterday.

The Ethics Committee

investigators are trying to determine

who leaked the report to CBS report-

er Daniel Schorr.

"Who were they?" counsel John.

Marshal asked Field.

"I'LL TELL YOU in executive

(closed) session," Field replied.

Field, who ran the staff of the now-

defunct intelligence panel, was the

Ilth witness to testily in the final

phase of the four-months-long, $150,-

000 Ethics Committee, probe. He

denied he leaked the report and said

he does not know who did.

The Intelligence Committee earl-

er this year completed its probe of

CIA covert activities with a report

filled with classified information and

seyerely 'critical of U.s. spy opera-

tions. The House voted to

report secret until President Ford

could censor it.

Schorr got a copy from a source he

refuses to identity and gave it to the

New York newspaper Village Voice,

which published much of it verbatim.

Field made

his comment

about

"White House personnel to Mostrate Y-

his claim . supported by several

previous witnesses - that copies of

the report circulated throughout

Washington and eould have reached" t

Schorr in many ways."

FIELD SUSPECTS the leak came

from

someone

in

the

executive

branch and possibly the CIA itself, he

said.

Marshal asked Field to describe

the extertor of the Washington house

he occupied during the intelligence

investigations. After Field, looking

puzzled, did so; Marsha/asked:

"Did Miss Susan Parker. come to

your residence Feb. 62*

171%

"'I never neara the name," Field

replied.

Asked whether he gave a drait of

the report to Miss Parker, Field said,

"Absolutely not. I did not provide a

tee's director of investigation, had

identified Miss Parker on Monday as

secretary to Clay Felker, editor-in

chief of the Village Voice. Bowers

said Felker sent

Miss

Parker to

Washington on Feb. 6 to get the

- Schorr copy.

"She went to an unrecalled ad-

dress where she picked up a package

York by shuttle flight aware the

He said his staft handled 75,000

The Ethies Committee adjourned

its probe until Monday morning.

Droppung the

An underlying condition ot Anglo-

Saxon democracy is that sensible peo-

ple do not press to the limit questions

to which there are no good answers.

That rule of thumb applies with a

vengeance to the current inyestigation

by the House ethics.committee of the

intelligence committee report given by

Dan Schorr of CBS News to the Village

Voice.

The inyestigation touches an unset-

tled area of constitutional law. The in:

terest of all, parties including both the

Congress and especially the press is

that the unsettled area be kept unset-

tled, that the moment of constitutional

truth be avoided

The elementary facts of the case are

simple. A House committee under Con:

gressman Otis Pike prepared a report

on activities of the Central Intelligence:

Agency, Copies of the report were ac-

quired by vr, Schorr of CBS and John

Crewdson of the New York Times Both

men made known the contents of the

report through, their respective news

agencies.

The full Congress then voted to make

the report secret..

Whereupon, Mr.

Schorr, after some complex maneu-

yers, passed his copy off to the Village

Voice, a weekly put out in New Yors.

which it claimed, possibly wrongly; was;

the tull text of the report.

That sequence of events set up a por

tential conflict between two traditional

rights rooted in the Constitution. One is

the freedom of the press, as guaranteed

by the First Amendment. The other 15:

the right of the Congress to discipline

its members, and to punish by con

tempt proceedings persons refusing to

cooperate with legitimate congres

sional investigations.

The freedom of the press; and the

First Amendment need no endorse

ment in this quarter. Democracy means

government by the people which im

plies open discussion and the circula-

tion of information as distinct from en

forced orthodoxy. The right to a free

press is thus a peculiarly cherished fea-

ture of our system, rightly enshrined in

the Constitution

The exercise of that right was central

to revelation and prosecution of the

Watergate scandal, and to the public

awareness of the true nature of the

Vietnam war. The right deseryes to be

guarded lealously; as it was by those.

The answer lies in a considered congressional deci

alone. The temporary Senate intelligence committee

took an effective step in this direction. In the Senate

to formalize congressional access to information, to

trouble if it builds understanding and support for

this kind of useful model of congressional Executive

cooperation in the national security arena.

The President's change of mindcame

at a White House meeting shortly after

he read MeClory's letter, and in the:

face ofa strongno-compromise position:

by; both Secretary of State Henry

kissinger and william Colby, then

director of the GIA.

Colby, whose cooperation with the

Senate committee seemed boundless,

was bitterly upset at the House com;

mitfee's leak revealing CIA knowledge.

about Egyptian communications on the

eve of the 1973 war Kissinger, a per

sonal target of the House committee,

which wanted him held in contempt of

the House, was equally bitter

Thus, after the:Presidenthimself had

been persuaded to abandon his no-wins

position by McClary and Republican

House leaders, Mr. Ford turned to

Colby and asked: "Bill, can't we give

them what they want?'

Colby's response: Yes, sid

but wei

must retain the power of prior

clearance for actual publication of any.

classified material that goes to the Pike

committee:"

Mr. Ford. then in effect offered

himselfas guarantor of the-com

mittee's,good faith. He pledged to Colby

that if the full committee approved the

plan he and Pike had worked out no

release of state-secrets without prior

clearance he personally: would

oversee it and act as final anbiter of

disputes.

Further, the former House member

from Michigan, gave those present to:

understand that no House member and

no House committee would dishonor

any agreement so carefully constrücted

as this one.

That was the background for the

CIA's submission of every, significant

document asked by the Pikeicommittee

and for the incredible decision by nine.

members of the 13-member committee

to release its final report despite the

CIA's objection that it included 240

specific security breaches.

This was the decision the' House

flattened, That the report's judiest

parts nad already been leaked is

shameful, given

the,

Pike-Ford

agreement. But those leaks cannot

obseure the change of mood that has

resulted from this interplay. between a

President whose most distinguished

virtue is.honesty and a.House.committe

majority that cannotjustify.its actions:

Pike himself is now.saying thatif the

reportis not released, President Ford

stands guilty of the worst "coverup"

since Watergate.

Some

suspicious congressmen

seeking a motive for Otis Pike-Until

now one of the most respected mem

bers of Congress- believe Pikealways

wanted a grand court battle with the

President: In the end, the Supreme

Court would surely have ruled for Pike.

Instead, "the Democratic-controlled

Was CIA better?

Out of the confused welter of charges and in-

Vestigations of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), we draw

two tenative conclusions.

First, the CIA, as an intelligence gathering agency;

was more dependable as a rule than its bosses in the

State Department, the Defense Department, and the

White House.

I Second, the FBIs notion of what constituted un-

patriotic or subversive behavior was right out of Russia;

whether Czarist or Communist.

CHAIRMAN OTIS G. PIKE Of the

House.

. of

Representatives Intelligence Committee said the other

day the Ford Administration is blocking publication.of

the Committeels report because it makes officials like

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger look bad. "It's the

people who were telling the CIA what to do who are

going, to look bad," he said.

One has no way of judging, since the Committee's

report has not been published and won't be if the

White House has its wave;

But there's a hint from the past. Like many other

people, we were startled by the Pentagon Papers

revelationthat the CIA estimates of enemy military, and

political strength in Vietnam were consistently more

accurate than the public statements from the Pentagon

and the White House that were supposedly based on the

CIA estimates. We learned a new respect then for the

CIA's skill at gathering and interpreting information.

(We consider intelligence gathering separately from

the CIA's covect political and military activities

overseas; activities which, in general, we believe are a

wrong way for the United States to pursue a foreign

policy.)

We suspect there's more truth than fiction in

Congressman Pike's Charge, and we think the report

ought tò be made public so the public can make its own

judgment,

REVELATIONS abogt the mBrs antude

ty ward Martin Luther king are extremely disquieting.

I, has long been known that the FBl hated and per

secuted the black civil rights leader. Lately it has been

charged that FBl agents or informants took an active?

part in the 1968 Memphis riots which were designed to!

discredit King's nonviolence and which drew King back

to the city where he was assassinated.

It's never been clear why the FBI was so harsh toward

Martin Luther King. There seems reason to believe I

Edgar Hoover, the late FBI director, had a personal

hatred for King. But the involvement of many agents

and informants

,in anti-King activities, and the

exultation many agents felt when King was killed

suggest that the attitude had permeated deep into the

Bureau.

*, But why? Did Hoover or his agents truly believe King

was subversive? That he was out to destroy America?

King was absolutely transparent. Heystated his goals

and tactics publicly; again and again. There was no

mystery about him or about what he was doing. How

could the FBI imagine he was a threat to America? A

threat, perhaps; to that old institution, American

racism, but certainly not a threat to the America of

freedom and justice, for all the America the FBI is

supposed to be protecting,

Yet the FBI did misunderstand and misrepresent

King and hundreds of other patriotic dissidents:

The

Pike compláined:that.in.explaining

the restrictions the White House con-

But. Pike said the proposal was so

roadly worded that it could prevent

"the committee from obtaining infor

"If we accepted the Presidentis

Despite Supreme Court

which can include the tele-

phone calls of Americans,

CIA Director William W.

Colby said today

In

from

: Rep. Les Aspin,

:D:

Wis., Colby at first said the

NSA monitors both interna-

United States and foreign

countries and calls entirely

within foreign countries:

Colby later tried to soften

his revelation by saying he

had not said the intercep

country:

But Aspin told reporters

the committee has other

evidence that indicates the

NSA regularly intercepts

international calls frop or

to the United States.

"That is illegal;" Aspin

said, noting Supreme Court

decisions and

laws against

wiretapping.

AFTER

THE hearing,

Colby refused to amplify on

his remarks. He said the

"foreign

told

a reporter to

"draw.

whether this included tele

one party was in the United

WASHINGTON (UPI) -- REP• MICHAEL HARRINGTON: D-MASS..

SAID TODAY

HE HAS GATHERED ENOUGH HOUSE SIGNATURES TO FORCE A SPECIAL MEETING OF

THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THE HOUSE SELECT

A SPOKESMAN FOR THE CAUCUS SAID NONE HAD YET BEEN SCHEDULED IN

ADVANCE OF THE NEXT REGULAR MEETING JULY 1S.

A RESOLUTION

WHICH THE RULES COMMITTEE WILL TAKE UP ON WEDNESDAY

WOULD ABOLISH THE SPECIAL PANEL ON GROUNDS A RIFT BETWEEN COMMITTEE

FACTIONS HAS MADE THE PANEL UNABLE TO FUNCTION.

HARRINGTON SAID,

"EFFORT TO ABOLISH THE SELECT COMMITTEE RATHER

PRIMARY ISSUE -- ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. SUCH ACTION WOULD

CLEARLY SUGGEST A LACK OF INTEREST IN REVEALING THE TRUTH.

AND THROW

INTO QUESTION THE INTEGRITY OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE MEMBERSHIP."

WHEN THE SPECIAL MEETING IS CALLED, HARRINGTON SAID, HE WILL OFFER

A MOTION "FOR THE CAUCUS TO INSTRUCT MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE

ON RULES NOT TO APPROVE OR REPORT ANY RESOLUTION TO ABOLISH THE HOUSE

SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE."

THE 50 SIGNATURES SUPPORTING THE SPECIAL MEETING CONSISTED

PRIMARILY OF FRESHMEN AND THE MORE LIBERAL MEMBERS OF THE MAJORITY

DEMOCRATS.

Washington Post Stait Writer

Contending that the integrity

their investigation, of the

Central Intelligence Agency was

at stake; Democrats on the

House Intelligence Committee

demanded yesterday that Rep.

Lucien N: Nedzi (D Mich,) step

down as chairman.

Nedzi refused, first at a tense

closed session of the committee

in the Capitol and then again t

a 75-minute conference

of all

seven Democrats on the panel

with House Speaker Carl Albert,

/(D Okla.).

A showdown is expected:

next. week. Rep. Robert N.

Giaimo D-Corin:), one of the:

committee's most _influential

members, said he was deter-

mined to resign unless Nedzi

is replaced.
