MR. PIKE'S POSITION ‘on the report of his House Inspection ~ oof
i intelligence committee is, in brief, untenable. He agreed  m s inal a é
last September i. accepting certain classified in- 7 Laboratory! inal
formation from the Executive branch that the White $ Plon. & Eval.
ca a House would be the final arbiter of what part of it would Spec. Inv. a
be disclosed. To claim that his pledge applied to the ania:
| receipt of information then but not to the reporting of it i‘ q btibtitd
| now is to make a mockery of his pledge and to undermine egal Coun.
i the basis on which any future intelligence oversight Telephone Rm.
ere | committee could ask for confidential information. That Director Sec’y __
i the information at issue describes ‘‘atrocious and
het horrendous things,” in Chairman Pike’s charac-
q terization, does not disscivenhis obligation to keep his
word. Nor is it a suitable alibi that much of the in-
formation nad leaked already, That merely raises the
question of whether the Pike committee was living up to
its obligation to maintain confidentiality in the period

before the release of the final report became an issue...

Fortunately, the Rules Committee was of a mind to
preserve the integrity of the House by holding up release
of the report until the full House had acted on it. And the
House followed suit last night by voting overwhelmingly
to delay disclosure. Mr. Pike has insisted that he would 5
release the full report or no report at all. We cannot
believe, however, that the House will be guided by his
stubbornness in the matter. Enough has leaked from the
report to establish that there is much of legitimate public
value in the sections of it likely to be approved by the
President. Chairman Pike's cry of “cover-up” will only
become reality if he is allowed to make it so.

~ The whole episode in fact underlines the difficulties of
countenancing and controlling a secret agency in a

democracy—even an agency whese ostensible purpose is
to protect that democracy. Mr. Pike, not alofi; Went at
the intelligence establishment determined to root out the
abuses of secret power which had transpired over the
“years, Those abuses were real and frightening, em-

Periling not only the liberties of American citizens but, in

RARE SY PEELE

So ¢£

—_—
somé Cases, t the very security which the agencies were
meant to uphold. It is true, too, that to the extent that
power continues to be wielded unaccountably, there can
be no firm guarantee that it will not again be abused. It is
a fair question whether the costs of secrecy outweigh the
claimed benefits, which in the best of circumstances are
likely to be difficult to confirm. Mr. Pike has no corner on
honest concern.

The opposite risk is, of course. that too little weight will
be given to the “fact” that the world remains a menacing
place and that it would be tempting fate to go over to an
open security system which would deny the country and,
within it, the Executive branch the flexibility needed to
vope with what the President and his advisers perceive to
be grave national threats. This is, we think, the trap into
which Mr. Pike has fallen. Disclosure of the particular
secrets which he would now like to tell may or may not be
as harmful as the administration claims. The point is,

‘nonetheless, that the right to conduct some national

security affairs in secrecy must be upheld.

There can be no congressional oversight unless the
President takes the Congress into his confidence. But the
Congress cannot take the Congress into his confidence if
secrets are to be betrayed. Just how oversight should be
conducted and to what extent Congress should be em-
powered to veto operations which its overseers disap-
proved are questions being addressed in.the proposals

* for reform offered yesterday, for instance, bya majority

of the Senate intelligence committee. We intend to return
to these and other such proposals. If there is not a
modicum of mutual confidence and trust between the
Executive and Congress, however, it becomes foolish
even to consider reform. The security of the country and
the liberty of its citizens can best be pursued—we are
tempted to say, can only be effectively pursued—when
there is respect for the procedures agreed on between the
two branches. That is why it is so important for both of
them’to keep the agreements they do manage to work out

with each other a

REUTER 1-23
WITH REPORT

WASHINGTON (UPI) -~- THE DRAFT OF A HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE \
REPORT ON CIA USE OF THE NEWS MEDIA ALLEGES “FREQUENT MANIPULATION”

i OF DISPATCHES OF THE BRITISH NEWS AGENCY REUTER. .

i REPORTERS WHO HAVE SEEN PORTIONS OF THE DRAFT SAID IT CRITICIZES
THE CIA FOR INFILTRATING AGENTS INTO THE MEDIA AND USING FOREIGN

\ Bae AND NEWS AGENCIES TO "FEED BACK” MATERIAL TO OTHER

4 H .

ONE PARAGRAPH OF THE DRAFT SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH “CIA DOES NOT
INTENTIONALLY PROPAGANDIZE IN THIS COUNTRY » CIA INSENSITIVITY TO THE
POSSIBILITY OF ITS ADULTERATING NEWS DIGESTED BY AMERICANS IS
INDICATED BY. ITS FREQUENT MANIPULATION OF REUTER WIRE SERVICE
DISPATCHES -- WHICH REGULARLY APPEAR IN U.S. MEDIA.”

THE DRAFT REPORT REPORTEDLY SAYS THAT THE CIA HAD ARGUED TO THE
COMMITTEE IT HAD LESS INHIBITION IN TRYING TO GET STORIES IT WANTED

, ON REUTER BECAUSE IT WAS A “FOREIGN NEWS AGENCY," NEGLECTING TO TAKE

f INTO ACCOUNT ITS SERVICE TO U.S. SUBSCRIBERS.

] sree ON REUTER MANAGING DIRECTOR GERALD LONG ISSUED THIS

“REUTER HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS BUSINESS FOR 125 YEARS, LARGELY
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUTH AND LIES. IF ANY
SO-CALLED INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION HAS PAID .STRINGERS To PASS ITS
HANDOUTS TO REUTERS IN THE GUISE OF NEWS, IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT
\ ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN WASTING THE TAXPAYER

enema a SE

S MONEY. :
Fi _ Per PROOF THAT ANY REUTER SERVICE HAS BEEN MANIPULATED. UNTIL

T TEND TO THINK THE AGENTS HAVE MANIPULATED THEIR
EMPLOYERS.”

Panel's Decision to Publish
Repost ‘on Secret Projects
Assailed by Ford Aide

= WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (AP)
= The House Intelligence com-
mittee voted today tu pud!

States intelligence operatic
in its final report. A spoke:
for President Ford Suageste
that the committee was break-
ing an agreement that Mr. Ford!

disclosures.

The report ways intelligence|
agencies spend $10 billion a
year on operations abroad, ac-
cording to the sources...

The committee rejected § to}
4 a motion to strike the classi-
fied information out of a 340-
page draft of the committee’s|
final report. 2

At the White Rouse, press|
secretary Zon Neesen said,
“Under the agreement the Pres4
ident should have had a chance|
to revidw the classified maier-|
jal in the report before it was
‘leaked to the public. The Pres-
ident views with most serious|
concern the leak of the alleged{
contents of the report.”

But committee members. in-
cluding its chairman, Otis Pike,
Democrat of New York, took
the position that no agreement}
with Mr. Ford could dict:
what the committee disclosed.
‘in its official report to the}
House.

Beyond that, Representative
Les Aspin, Democrat of Wis-
consin, contended that it would
“pej_a terrible, terrible prece-
dent” for the committee not
to insist hat Congress has as
much right as the President
to decide what information
should de public.

‘The draft report includes de-
tails on a number of secret
operations—including informa-_
tion on Tistian political funding
and aid to groups in Angola
that Mr. Ford had tried to
‘keep secret.

The agreement was that the}
committee could publicly di
close secrets under un agreed:
procedure but would not di
close any that Mr. Ford had?
personally declared would hurt,
ational security if made pub.
ic. i

The only way the iommittee
could override such a declara-
ticn and release information,
it agreed, would be to goto
court fora ruling that it could

Intelligence Committee
orenly today over the issue
of creating a new Congression-
al ranel to oversee the opera-
tions of the C.LA. and other
intelligence agencies.

In testimony before the Sen-
ate Government Operations
committee, Senator Frank
Church, Democrat of Idaho,
committee chairman, called for
creation of a Senate committee
that would have funding and

intelligence activities of such
agencies as the The agency,

ation, The National Security
Agency and the Defense Intel-
ligence Agency.

The committee’s vice chair-
man, John Tower, Republican

‘ight panel but added that only
one or two other members of
the intelligence committee
shared his view,

Mr. Church’s call for a new
committee was endorsed by the
Senate majority leader, Mike
Mansfield, Democrat of Monta-
na, who ‘called past Congres-
sional oversight “inexcusably
tax” and added that he would
make passage of legislation
creating an oversight commit-
tee a top priority of the current
session of Congress,

Mr. Mansfield noted that he
had first introduced legislation
to oversee the C.LA, nearly|
20’years ago but that it had
been opposed by then the agen-
cy's ditector, Allen Dulles. The!
agency defeated his attempti
Decause it “had the’ heirarchs
in their pocket,” Mr. Mansfield
said.

Senator Howard Baker Jr.,
Republican of Tennessee, an-|
other member o the intelligence
committee, endorsed creation|
of a new panel but Mr. Baker!
objected to two provisions in

Church. One would provide the’
Oversight committee with prior!
notification of covert opera-
tions, The other would reserve
for the Senate the right to
d¢classify Administrations\ce-
ctets.

John P. Mohr, a former
top official of the FBI, has
been interviewed under
oath by two bureau agents
in the final stage of the bu-
. reau's investigation of U.S.
Recording Co., an FBI
“front” or “cutout.”

Brian Gettings, a former
U.S. attorney who is repre-
senting both Mohr and Jo-
seph X, Tait, president of
Ee U.S. Recording, said the

hour-long interview took
place yesterday in his office
if Arlington.

Although testimony be-
fore the House Intelligence
Committee has raised the
possibility of financial

the operations of U.S.
Recording, Gettings said
\ Mohr was riot warned of his
right to remain silent be-
fore the interview began.
Normally, such a warn-
ing would be given routine-
ly if the investiggtion,
which began more than a
month ago, had developed
any information that*might
result in criminal action
against Mohr, y

HOMER BOYNTON, a
.Spokesman for the FBI,
said the investigation was
4 nearly completed and that
} the bureau hoped to have a
i report in the hands of Atty.
Gen, Edward H, Levi by the
\. end of next week.
;, Mohr retired three years
ago as the top administra-
\ tive officer in the bureau.

An investigation by the
House committee and the
bureau's investigation both
were started after Martin
Keyser, an inventor and
manufacturer of electronic
surveillance and detection
devices, told the committee
he had seen an invoice from
U.S. Recording showing a
markup of 30 percent on
material he had delivered
directly to the bureau.

He said U.S. Recording
served as a “cutout” so the
bureau could buy sensitive
equipment without foreign
spies finding out what kind
of equipntent it was using.

an unrelated case last year

MOHR HAS NOT been
interviewed by committee
investigators. When he was
asked to testify under oath,
Gettings said, he tola the
committee he would do so if
it obtained a subpoena.

“Quite frankly,” he ac-
knowledged, “I thought it
was a little late for them to
get a subpoena.” .

When’ bureau agents
asked for a statement under
oath late last week, Get-
tings said, he laid down one
ground rule: The statement;
could be sent to any other!
federal agency, but not to|
the committee, which is
headed.by Rep. Otis Pike,”
D-N.Y. The bureau and the
Justice Department agreed
to that condition, he said
and the interview was con-
ducted yesterday morning. -

Although Getttings de-
sclined to provide details of
the questions and answers,
he said the intérview was
devoted largely to goin

- By Norman Kempster

fe Washington Star Staff Writer

House Intelligence Committee
Chairman Otis G. Pike, D-N.Y., said
today he will go ahead with plans to
file with the full House a contempt of
Congress resolution against Secre-
tary of State Henry A. Kissinger de-
spite a last-minute compromise offer

- from President Ford.

In a telephone interview, Pike said
he did not consider the compromise
to be “substantial compliance” with
the committee's month-old subpoena
for copies of State Department
proposals’ for covert action projects
since 1961. i:

Apparently hoping .to block the
contempt action, Ford offered to give
the committee a list of covert
projects undertaken since 1961, iden-
tifying the agency which proposed
each. . :

PIKE SAID Ford's plan would not
show whether any State Department
proposals were rejected by the ‘40
Committee,” which supervises cov-
ert action, or by the White House.

- In addition, Pike said, “You get a
very diferent flavor, 1 presume, out
of the minutes of the 40 Committee
than you would from the original
‘State Department proposals.”

The purpose of the committee's
subpoena was to permit the lawmak-
‘ers to assess the influence of the
State Department on covert projects
= secret efforts to manipulate the
politics of foreign countries — guring

S| :
i. a
Pike Will Press-for Kissinger Cita

the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
administrations.

THE COMMITTEE voted a con-
tempt citation against Kissinger for
refusing to comply with that subpoe-
na and two others. The administra-
tion subsequently agreed to provide
the information sought by the other
two subpoenas, leaving the one for
State Department documents the
only matter still in contention.

Pike said the committee will de-
cide at a meeting tomorrow whether
Ford’s proposal is acceptable. The
committee accepted a White House
compromise proposal on an earlier
subpoena over Pike’s objection. But
in previous discussions of the Kissin-
ger subpoena, a majority of the com-
mittee appeared to be unwilling to
accept less than they had demanded.

In the meantime, Pike said he
would file with the full House later -
today the committee’s report charg-
ing Kissinger with contempt. The
chairman could then schedule the
matter for a vote at any time, al-
though he indicated he was in no
hurry to take that step.

IF THE HOUSE voted contémpt,
the matter would go to U.S. Atty.
Earl Silbert for prosecution. If con-
victed by a jury, Kissinger could be
sentenced to up to a year in jail, al-
though Pike concedes that such an
outcome is highly unlikely.

_.“No one is. seeking to place Mr.
Kissinger in jail,” Pike said in a let-
ter to all members of the House las
week. “And tlfe worst that can hap}

per] to him is}that he might have fo
prdvide the dgcuments subpoenaed to
Congress.”

Pike said he assumed that the
“Dear Colleague” letter prompted
the compromise. White House coun-
- sel Phillip Buchen offered the addi-
tional information on behalf of the
President.

Buchen's letter was dated Satur-
day, but Pike said he did not receive
it until this morning.

BUCHEN SAID Ford authorized
the proposed compromise “to meet
the legitimate needs of the commit-
tee for information on covert opera-
tions.”

Ford has cited executive privilege
as the reason for refusing to comply
‘with the letter of the subpoena. How-
ever, a majority of the members of
the committee have argued that a
president has no authority to invoke
sexecutive privilege concerning the
dgcuments of previous administra-
tions.

the strength of cur national character,
and the integrity of our leaders. We

age (o lest actions undertaken in our
name, By this standard, the House sub-

stituted an act of insecurity for na-
tional security by retreating to a si-
Jence that is a national shame.

Our report did not reveal secrets; it
-revealed policy. It did not name agents,
because name: re not under inv
tigation. It revealed no secret tech-
higues, because tectt.ical matters were
/ not al issue. It was writlen to be pub-
* Jished. by patriotic people. ©

Scare tactics that intimidate elected
xepreseritatives. and prevent them from
reporting on the conduct of unelected
_ exécntives cannot be tolerated, with:

out a fearful siience next time,
‘Our committee
d States. undermined demo-
elections in Italy in 1972 with
bribes and dirty tricks. If this seems
| academic, consider that many of the
same officials who rigged the Italian
election planned the Watergate opera-
tion « few. weeks later. .

‘We uncovered a‘decision by Richard
M. Nixon and: Henry. A. Kissinger to
involve the Central Intelligence Agency
in a war by the Kurds against Iraq
four years ago without telling Con-
press or the Secretary of Defense
(never mind the’ American people).
Even so, the House ended up investi-
gating, those who esked questions,
rather than those who made war in
back rooms, . .

Congress often finds silence niore
comfortable, Oversight committees are
notable for their ‘hindsight and being
out-of-sight. We revealed that in some
recent years not‘a single congress-
man or senator showed up to hear the
. C.LA’s annual program review, that
one C.I.A, oversight committee had no
staff, and that crimes reported to it
- were never investigated. What hap-
pened? We were investigated!

‘Daniel Schorr’s publicatiun of our com-
“mittee’s final report was far more

threatening, They photographed my
house, questioned friends about my
wife und social occasions at my home,
asked details about phone calls that
‘they somehow knew about, interro-
gated colleagues I had not seen for

years. Others were questioned about

.their sexual relationships,

The Ethics Committee did not want
facts; they *-anted ‘a scapegoat. I had
no evidence of who gave Mr. Schorr
our report, so committee members ar-
gued with me, insulted my testimony,
questioned my patriotism, compared
me with Watergate conspirators, mis-
Jed others about my testimony, and
then- forbade me to speak publicly.

- When I refused to falsely accuse their

chosen scapegoat, a “committee source”
‘leaked that there were “discrepancies”
in testimony by top staff members and
implied that all of us were suspects.
‘That was untrue.

REPORT FROt. AMERICA
CONGRESS'S HIDDEN JAIL CELL \,

BY JOHN MOODY

NEW YORK (UPI) -- FEW PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE JAIL CELL HIDDEN
THE CAVERNOUS RECESSES OF THE/ HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. CBS REPORTER
DANIEL SCHORR KNOWS IT'S THERE, BUT HE HAS NO DESIRE TO SEE IT.

Plans er era DOWN BY THE’ CONGRESSNEN "§ Gym," HE SAID -DURING THE
: TAPING OF TODAY'S NBC TALK SHOW, "TOMORROW."
ae SCHORR COULD SOON HOLD THE DISTINCTION OF BEING ONE OF THE FEW
! eee EVER FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS. HE ADMITTED EARLIER

THIS MONTH THAT HE PROVIDED COPIES OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE REPORT ON CIA COVERT ACTIVITIES TO THE NEW YORK WEEKLY,
VILLAGE VOICE.

THE NEWSPAPER LATER PUBLISHED THE DOCUMENTS, WHICH REVEALED CIA
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ANTI-COMMUNIST ITALIAN POLITICAL CANDIDATES AND-
MILITARY SUPPORT FOR ANGOLAN AND IRAQI SOLDIERS. fs

THE REPORT WAS WITHHELD FROM THE PUBLIC ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT
COULD ENDANGER NATIONAL SECURITY i

REP. SAMUEL STRATTON, D-NeYos “sarp SCHORR'S ACTION MADE HIM GUILTY
OF CONTEMPT OF THE HOUSE, AND the COMMITTEE HAS REQUESTED $350,000 TO
FIND OUT HOW HE GOT A copy OF THE "PIKE REPORT," NAMED AFTER THES
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, REP..OTIS PIKE

IF HE IS FOUND eurLty OF THE CHARGES, SCHORR SAID, HE COULD BE-
wae TO A TERM IN THE HOUSE JAIL, "OR WHATEVER ASE THE HOUSE —

.

"IN 1793, I THINK IT WAS, THE HOUSE FOUND A REPORTER IN CONTEMPT
FOR SAYING THAT ONE OF ITS MEMBERS HAD TAKEN A BRIBE. IT SENTENCED |
HIM TO A WEEK IN THE JAIL," SCHORR SAID.

._ "THE PROCESS IS REALLY "LIKE A BILL OF ATTAINDER, WHERE. YOU CAN cof.
AFTER SOMEBODY JUST BY SAYING HE COMMITTED A CRINEs THAT IDEA. pelle

=

BEEW TERRIBLY POPULAR IN THIS COUNTRY FOR THE LAST 200 YEARS.
“WHAT I auENK I'M ASSERTING qs NOT THE REPORTER'S RIGHT To REPOR.
BUT alte PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO KNOW," HE SAID. *

"IF THE PRESIDENT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAY NOT TO PUBLISH THE
, PENTAGON PAPERS.AND .THE NEW YORK TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST DO, THEY
j CAN SAYy "YOU MAKE THE RULES FOR THE PRESIDENT'’S ADMIN JISTRATION BuT
a YOU DON'T MAKE RULES FOR ME." I HAVE TO SAY THE SAME THING TO THE
HOUSE: "VOU DON'T MAKE RULES FOR ME.'"
CBS HAS SUSPENDED SCHORR, WITH PAY, FROM HIS REGULAR CAPITOL HILL
- BEAT, PENDING A DECISION ON THE CHARGE. BUT THE NETWORK SAID IT WOULD
DEFEND THE REPORTER'S DECISION, IN COURT IF NECESSARY.
SCHORR SAID HE HOPED THE CONTROVERSY WOULD PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE 2
RULING ON THE RIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL NEW REPORTENG «
"IF IT'S GONE THIS FAR, I-HOPE IT JUST WON'T BE DROPPED," HE SAID.
"I'D LIKE IT TO BE DROPPED WITH THE DEFINITE SENSE THAT THY VE DONE
THIS AND THEY'VE MADE A MISTAKE."

- Got Intelligence Report |

BY RICHARD D. LYONS *

Spec to The New York times «| *
“WASHINGTON, Feb. 26—The|
{House ethics committee moved|
today toward a full-scale inves-
{tigation of the leaking of the|
[House - intelligence committee
report in which it would have}
broadened powers to, subpoena|
lwitnesses and they would be

agents of-the Federal “Bureau
fof Investigation. —.
Sources close to the .com-| .
mittee, which has made a for-|-
mal request for broader subpoe-
na power, said its members|
were intent on taking seriously,
ast week’s mandate from the,
full House to make such an in-|
vestigation and that they
planned to pursue it vigorously,
Responding to a request from
the committee, the F.B.L has
detailed “half a dozen agents
Jor less” to the committee to
assist its efforts. .
The committee, officially
known as. the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct,
has neither an - investigatory.

staff nor even a counsel. In its,

Inine years of existence, it has
lyet to formally investigate any-
fone. i
“This’ is a whdle new game|
_ us,” & committee staff. aide|
Isaid. .

At issue ‘is the means . by!
‘which Daniel Schorr, a CBS|
‘News correspondent here, . ob-}
tained a copy of the report of|
the House Select Committee on
Intelligence. The report covered}
‘a detailed investigation and
‘contained a ‘critique of thej
operations of the Central Intel-}
ligence Agency.

H Extensive Excerpts

After the House voted Jast!
month to keep the report se-
leret, Mr. Schorr made his copy
{available to The Village Voice,
la_weekly newspaper in New
York City, which printed exten-)
Isive excerpts early this month,
The New York Times had pre-!
viously published articles con~!
cerning the main findings and
recommendations of the report.

“The pts_in
The Vill da fue

sentetives-stid that publication

was a betrayal of Confressional

questioned under oath. by} »

while ‘others said"it' was’
to wrap the TepOre ;
secrecy and.keep it from public

sc I. ie
‘ "Al Sugh the Housé formally’
demanded thé investigation’ by!
The Ethics: Committee, opposi-
jtion to it ‘has continued, but!
for widely.varying reasons. -

. “Howse Speaker, Sarl Albert of|
Oklahoma; at a news confer-
lence today, reiterated his un-
easiness about having F.B.,
agents involved .in matters of
the legislative branch, - .

But Mr. Albert noted that
ithe ethics committee had been
given “the authority to find
Jout -what happened” and said
thac, it ought “to “investigate
everybody” “involved with -the
report, including members of
the Ford Administration.

“Td like to bet $10 that a!
‘Congressman didn’t leak it,”2 he|
‘said, : sates
yA Delicate Issued
‘|: The delicate issie of the-use
of \F.B.I. agents was under-
scored by a Justice Department
spokesman today in announcing,
that they had been desailed to
the committee at its request.
Mark T. Sheehan, the spokes-|
man, emphasized’ that the
agents would not be “worl

the number: who would be

(NATIONAL SECURITY)

WASHINGTON (UPI) -- CIA DIRECTOR GEORGE BUSH SAYS NATIONAL
SECURITY WAS HURT BY THE LEAK OF A COMMITTEE REPORT ON INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES, BUT TO REVEAL THE DAMAGING ITEMS WOULD "HIGHLIGHT THOSE
AND MAKE THINGS WORSE."

ASKED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING DAMAGING IN THE REPORT CBS NEWSMAN
DANIEL SCHORR MADE AVAILABLE TO NEW YORK VILLAGE VOICE, BUSH REPLIED:
“SPHERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IN THERE, BUT IF 1 TOLD YOu THOSE
SPECIELeS THAT WOULD HIGHLIGHT THOSE AND MARE THINGS WORSES® :
"HE SAID THE BASIC QUESTION IS THAT "CONGRESS VOTED BY ALMOST
i TWO"To-ONE THAT THE REPORT NOT BE MADE PUBLIC AND IT WAS MADE PUBLIC
‘ ees THAT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG.

:** BUCH ACKNOULEDEED "CLEARLY ABUSES se. AWFUL ABUSES" IN THE CIA
INVOLVING BOTH DOMESTIC SPYING AND FOREIGN TACTICS, BUT HE PRAISED
PRESIDENT FORD'S PROPOSALS FOR TIGHTENING CIA OVERSIGHT IN THE
LEGISLATIVE, AND EXECUTIVE, BRANCHES AND NEV LAWS MAKING IT A CRIME FoR

A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYE TO LEAK SECRET INFORMATION.

"THERE WILL BE, 1 THINK, A BETTER AND MORE RESPONSIVE SYSTEM FOR*
PEOPLE (WITHIN GOVERNMENT)... TO SAFEGUARD THE PEOPLE OF THIS
COUNTRY FROM THE KINDS OF ABUSES THAT OFFENDED ME AND OFFENDED YOU,"

| BUSH SAID SUNDAY ON NBC'S MEET THE PRESS.

LEAKS, From Ai

Jaw which prohibits disclosure
for publication of cryp-
Ytographic cr _ code-related
“nformation, Buchen, ac-
‘cording -to wire service
‘reports, said just that last
Saturday in Philadelphia atan
-dmpromptu press conference,
Despite “those feelings,
"however, no request for the
“FBI tolook into the matter has
‘been sent to the attorney
meral, according to ad-
istration sources.

‘Although the FBI has not
vestigated any news leak
xases in the past six months,
‘According to a Justice
Department source, during
‘that period there have been
‘several important news leaks
-of secret information from the
executive branch:

— On Dec. 12, 1975, The New
York Times published a
detailed, authoritative story
on US, covert aid to Angola

- attributed to “a high-ranking
government official.” At that
time, administration policy
‘was to deny any involvement
in Angola and criticize
members of Congress who

spoke out based on secret .

briefings. -

‘The Times article, however, «

provided enough factual in-
formation for Congress to
force a halt to all Angolan aid.
The administration, one of-

ficial said recently, “was -...

exasperated” by the Times
Teak “but there was. no
systematic inguiry” as to
where it came from. State
Department officials, at the
time, said the CIA was the

* source because, said one

department aide, “it was tired

of taking the blame for

keeping the growing

paramilitary operation
secret.”

os,
Ca On Bee, 6, 1975, colum-

nists Rowland Evans andi
Robert Novak published the
contents of proposed options
for the US. SALT IL
negotiations within days of
their drafting and shortly
after they had been sent to
President Ford for his ap-
proval,

A similar SALT leak — this
one of the U.S. negotiating
position on the exact day. it
was being presented to the
Soviets ~ onAug. 24,1971, had

. triggered a widespread in-

vestigation within the Nixon
administration that included
FBI questioning and CIA

_polygraphing of State and

Defense department em-°
ployees.

Last December, ‘however,
according to administration
officials, there was no FBI
inguiry and only informal
questions raised among some
officials. The 1975 leak was
more critical than the 1971
leak, according to one official,
because the most recent one
gave the Soviets a long-term
insight into the US.
negotiating position.

On Jan, 28,1976, The New
York Times published in full”

. the text of a cablegram from.

United Nations Ambassador *
Daniel P. Moynihan as sent to
Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and all U.S. em-
bassies. The cable was
classified “limited official use
‘only” though it contained
“material of a. much higher

classification, including -
sensitive reports of con- -

versations’ with foreign
diplomats.

According to «e=xStete.
Department source, there has
been no serious effort made to
find who leaked the Moynihan
cable “though we believe it
“came out of State and not the
U.N. mission” in New York.

Since the inception of the HOUSTUDY Project, we have ae
accumulated 3 thick folders containing newspaper and wire service.
clippings plus some additional material such as magazine articles.
and other public source data, Material maintained in tickler ae
folder, Sub A file was never opened, Retained material is in t
general, but not precise chronological order. With the end -of the’
HSC mandate, it is believed we should now provide for tthe final and
permanent retention of this material,

This matter was discussed by writer with resssf

W. L. Bailey and L. W. Brady of the Records Management Bivision
-on 6/29/76 and it was agreed that the most practical manner of
handling would be to file this material as a bulky ienclosure
behind file and that no indexing would be necessary. Further,
that the original of this memorandum be fiiled in the main
HOUSTUDY file, 62-116464, and a copy be filed an Sub A

to 62-116464 which should be opened as a repository of :itt- alone.
The presence of a copy of instant memorandum in the Sub A will
4 as a permanent flag advising where ‘the material is actually
‘iled. :

THE MATERIAL SHOULD NOSE DECLASSIFIED, AND COMMS.®EE MEMBERS WOULD te
EAE et plationse NOTICE BEFORE TAKING A FORMAL VOTE ON DECLASSIFYING THE

PIKE SAID THE PROPOSAL WAS BEING FORWARDED TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND
WOULD NOT GUESS WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION WOULD BE. THERE WAS NO
IMMEDIATE REACTION FROM PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMEN.

MEANWHILE, PIXE READ TO THE HOUSE A LETTER HE WROTE FORD SAYING A
RED FOLDER CONTAINING HIGHLY SENSITIVE MATERIAL WAS MISPLACED BY A |. ‘
STAFF MEMBER WHO "SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DISMISSED.”

"BUT IT IS NOT WITHIN MY PQWER TO FIRE HIM," THE LETTER SAID. "HE « f
Is ON YOUR STAFF, NOT MINE. WHILE I DETEST INFORMERS s THE GRAVITY OF
THE eran AND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE COMPEL ME TO GIVE
LES HINT -- HE IS THE HUSBAND OF A MEMBER OF YOUR CABINET. *
'HE ONLY CABINET MEMBER WITH A HUSBAND IS MRS. CARLA HILLS.
sechetatt OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. HER HUSBAND», RODERICK, IS
A WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL.

COMMITTEE SPOKESNEN SAID LATER THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN A
TONGUE-IN-CHEEK STYLE BECAUSE "THE CHAIRMAN HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR,”
BUT_IS NONETHELESS BASED ON AN ACTUAL INCIDENT.

THEY EXPLAINED THAT HILLS LEFT BEHIND A FOLDER OF SENSITIVE
MATERIAL AFTER A VISIT TO PIXE LAST WEEK. HE CALLED LATER IN THE DAY
-- FRANTICALLY, THEY SAID -- TO FIND OUT IF HE HAD LEFT IT THERE.
PIKE SAID HE HAD, AND WHEN HILLS ASKED FOR IT BACK PIKE REFUSED.

EARLIER WEDNESDAY, PIXE REJECTED INFORMATION PROFFERED BY THE CIA
AND RETURNED IT SAYING IT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE IT WAS
INCOMPLETE AND STRINGS WERE ATTACHED TO ITS USE.

THE WHITE HOUSE SO FAR_HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE COMMITTEE'S
FUBPOENA FOR INFORMATION REGARDING INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES RELATING
TO THE COMMUNIST TET OFFENSIVE OF 1968, PIKE SAID, BUT THE PANEL WILL
HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING THURSDAY ON INTELLIGENCE FAILURES DURING THAT
MASSIVE COMMUNIST ATTACK IN VIETNAM.

PIKE SAID THE COMMITTEE "WOULD NOT SHRINK" FROM. TAKING THE
PRESIDENT TO COURT IF HE FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE PANEL'S SUBPOENA,
BUT FOR THE aoe PREFERS NOT TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE DELAY WHICH
WOULD BE INVOLVE.

PRECEDENT IN DEC DING ON ITS OWN TO DECLASSIFY THF MATERIAL.

"THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE'S ACTION IS A
MOST SERIOUS ONE," LEE SAID.

BY DANIEL Fs GILMORE

WASHINGTON (UPI) -~ WHAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THE SECRETS
OF THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE GATHERING SYSTEM IS ADEQUATELY TOLD
SELECTED OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES, SAYS CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
DIRECTOR WILLIAM E. COLBY.

CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS ARE NOT SO SURE. i

COLBY, APPEARING MONDAY BEFORE THE HOUSE COMMITTEE’ INVESTIGATING
UsS. INTELLIGENCE, SAID THERE ALREADY IS ENOUGH MACHINERY TO MONITOR
THE SPY APPARATUS THAT SECRETS MUST REMAIN SECRET, ESPECIALLY HOU
MUCH IS SPENT TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE.

NO OFFICIAL FIGURE HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN FOR THE TOTAL YEARLY COST
OF THE LARGE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH ESTIMATES
RANGE UP TO $6 BILLION TO $7 BILLION

COLBY REFUSED TO GIVE ANY STATISTICS BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN HEARING.
WHICH FINALLY WENT INTO EXECUTIVE SESSION STILL NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT
GETTING THE ANSWERS IT WANTED

COLBY WILL TESTIFY AGAIN WEDNESDAY ON THE CIA'S PART IN THE
INTELLIGENCE NETWORK.
BOTH THE HOUSE COMMITTEE AND ITS SENATE COUNTERPART ARE ‘FOREGOING

THE AUGUST CONGRESSIONAL RECESS TO HOLD DAILY HEARINGS

THE TWO PANELS peed ARE HEARING FROM OFFICIALS oF THE DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIE:

THE SENATE PANEL FTONDAY QUESTIONED AN UNIDENTIFIED WITNESS ON CIA
Creeen ceeci ane BUT MADE NO ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWING THE ALL~DAY.

AFTER COLBY INSISTED THAT DISCUSSION OF INTELLIGENCE BUDGETS BE
HEARD ONLY IN SECRET, THE HOUSE COMMITTEE VOTED $ TO 5 TO GO INTO
CLOSED SESSION, ALTHOUGH PROTESTING THAT A SECRET HEARING FRIDAY
FAILED TO GET THE BUDGET INFORMATION IT REQUESTED FROM JAMES T. LYNN,
ees THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET, WHICH OVERSEES THOSE

COLBY OBJECTED TO JUNIOR COMMITTEE STAFF MEMBERS BEING PRESENT AND
ALS© INSISTED THAT ONE OF HIS ELECTRONICS EXPERTS, WHO CARRIED A

BLACK LEATHER BAG, GO THROUGH THE CHAMBER TO *SWEEP" IT FOR "BUGS."

NCY SAYS ALEXANDER

WATERGATE TAPES LED TO PRESIDENT NIXON'S DOWNFALL, HELD A SPECIAL

: CIA~MILITARY LIAISON CLEARANCE IN 1959
: CLEARANCES WHEN HE SERVED IN THE WHITE
qf IN A RARE PUBLIC STATEMENT, THE CIA
DETAILING EMPLOYES TO OTHER GOVERNMENT
THAT THIS AMOUNTED TO "PENETRATION" OR
KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE AGENCIES.
BUT THE CIA DENIED THAT BUTTERFIELD
WORKED FOR IT "IN ANY CAPACITY.
(THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED TODAY

aoneet nee CIA INTELLIGENCE
ACKNOWLEDGED THE PRACTICE OF
AGENCIES BUT STRONGLY DENIED
“INFILTRATION” WITHOUT ay

WAS EVER A CIA EMPLOYE OR
THAT A 1973 CIA INSPECTOR

GENERAL'S REPORT SAID CIA PERSONNEL HAD FOR MANY YEARS BEEN DETAILED
‘ TO "THE IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE” AND TO OTHER AGENCIES

f SUCH AS THE TREASURY AND COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS AND THE PRESIDENT'S
FOREIGN ADVISORY BOARD. )

BUTTERFIELD, WHO RECENTLY RESIGNED AS HEAD OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION
ADMINISTRATION, WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT. HIS WIFE SAID HE HAD
GONE TO CALIFORNIA IN CONNECTION WITH A NEW POSITION. SHE SAID SHE
KNEW NOTHING OF (A CTA CONNECTION.

FLETCHER PROUTY, A RETIRED AIR FORCE COLONEL, CREATED CONSIDERABLE
CONFUSION FRIDAY BY PUBLICLY INSISTING THAT BUTTERFIELD, ALSO A
FORMER AIR FORCE OFFICER, HAD BEEN A CIA "CONTACT MAN” IN THE WHITE
HOUSE WHEN HE WORKED THERE IN THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION.

PROUTY INSISTED THAT AS A "CONTACT MAN" BUTTERFIELD WOULD BE
EXPECTED TO LOOK AFTER CIA INTERESTS, FACILITATING CERTAIN ACTIONS
AND POSSIBLY SHIELDING SECRET OPERATIONS FROM EXPOSURE.

ASKED BY NEWSMEN IF BUTTERFIELD MIGHT HAVE SPIED ON PRESIDENT
NIXON FOR THE CIA, HE REPLIED: "IN THIS CASE, NO."

WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY RON NESSEN, TRAVELING WITH PRESIDENT
FORD TO THE MIDWEST, GAVE REPORTERS “A WRITTEN STATEMENT WHICH SAID:

"WE HAVE NO INFORMATION TO SUBSTANTIATE THE ALLEGATION THAT A MEMBER
OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WAS A SECRET CIA AGENT OR INDEED ANY
KIND OF CIA AGENT. NOR HAVE WE HEARD OF SUCH INFORMATION." d

CONCERN THAT THE CIA MAY HAVE BEEN "INFILTRATING" UNDERCOVER ;
AGENTS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER AGENCIES WAS AROUSED BY REP. i
ROBERT KASTEN, R-WIS.. A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ’
INTELLIGENCE.

SEN. FRANK CHURCH, CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE'S SELECT INTELLIGENCE
PANEL, SAID FRIDAY HIS INVESTIGATION HAD TURNED UP NO EVIDENCE THAT
THE CIA HAD "PLANTED" SECRET AGENTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT ITS
KNOWLEDGE. BUT HE ADDED:

"FOR A LONG TIME THE CIA HAS SUPPLIED PERSONNEL THAT HAVE BEEN
DETAILED TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER PERSONNEL HAVE FROM TIME TO ;
TIME BEEN DETAILED TO OTHER EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. |

"THE PRESIDENT HAS KNOWN THAT THESE CIA AGENTS OR OFFICIALS HAVE
BEEN DETAILED."

PROUTY, WHO HIMSELF SERVED AS A LIAISON OFFICER WITH THE CIA IN
THE AIR FORCE. EXPLAINED TO NEWSHEN SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS OF A
7 ACT MAN."

HE DISCLOSED THAT THE CIA SENT TWO TWO-MAN TEAMS BY SMALL PLANE TO
CUBA IN LATE 1959 OR EARLY 1930 IN AN ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE CUBAN
PREMIER FIDEL CASTRO BY SHOOTING HIM WITH RIFLES EQUIPPED WITH
TELESCOPIC SIGHTS.

THE OPERATION INVOLVED ENTERING THE TWO AIRCRAFT FALSELY AS A
SINGLE AIRCRAFT ON A SINGLE FLIGHT PLAN, AND ARRANGING FOR THEM TO
LEAVE THE UNITED STATES AND RETURN TO IT WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM {
U.S. AIR DEFENSE FIGHTERS.

PROUTY SAID AS A CIA *CONTACT MAN" HE MADE THOSE ARRANGEMENTS.

PROUTY SAID FRIDAY THE TEAMS FLEW TO THE ISLAND IN TWO SMALL
AIRCRAFT. HE SAID ONE TEAM LANDED ON A DESERTED ROAD IN CUBA BUT
STAYED ONLY MINUTES. THEN TOOK OFF AGAIN FOR THE UNITED STATES. HE
DID NOT EXPLAIN WHY THE MISSION WAS ABORTED.

PROUTY TOLD REPORTERS HE WAS SO "THUNDERSTRUCK"™ WHEN FORMER CIA ~
DIRECTOR RICHARD HELMS DENIED ON TELEVISION THAT THE AGENCY HAD EVER
PARTICIPATED IN AN ASSASSINATION PLOT THAT HE CALLED CBS REPORTER
DANIEL SCHORR AND TOLD RIM:

(CIA) :
WASHINGTON (UPI) -~ REP. MICHAEL HARRINGTON, D-MASS.5 SAID TODAY

HE HAS GATHERED ENOUGH HOUSE SIGNATURES TO FORCE A SPECIAL MEETING OF \ a
THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THE HOUSE SELECT ce
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE.

IN AN EFFORT TO FORESTALL POSSIBLE HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE ACTION'
WEDNESDAY TO ABOLISH THE COMMITTEE, HARRINGTON GATHERED THE
SIGNATURES OF 50 DEMOCRATS ON A LETTER TO CAUCUS CHAIRMAN PHILLIP
BURTON, D-CALIF.

UNDER CAUCUS BYLAWS, 50 MEMBERS CAN REQUIRE A SPECIAL MEETING, BUT ri
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE CAUCUS SAID NONE HAD YET BEEN SCHEDULED IN
ADVANCE OF THE NEXT REGULAR MEETING JULY 15s.

4 RESOLUTION WHICH THE RULES COMMITTEE WILL TAKE UP ON WEDNESDAY
WOULD ABOLISH THE SPECIAL PANEL ON GROUNDS A RIFT BETWEEN COMMITTEE
FACTIONS HAS MADE THE PANEL UNABLE TO FUNCTION.

HARRINGTON SAID, "EFFORT TO ABOLISH THE SELECT COMMITTEE RATHER
THAN SEEK THE NECESSARY SOLUTIONS WILL, AND PERHAPS SHOULD, BE VIEWED
AS AN ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE HOUSE TO SHIFT FOCUS AWAY FROM THE
PRIMARY ISSUE ~~ ILLEGAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. SUCH ACTION WOULD
CLEARLY SUGGEST A LACK OF INTEREST IN REVEALING THE TRUTH, AND THROW
INTO QUESTION THE INTEGRITY OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE MEMBERSHIP.”

WHEN THE SPECIAL MEETING IS CALLED, HARRINGTON SAID. HE WILL OFFER
A MOTION "FOR THE CAUCUS TO INSTRUCT MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE
ON RULES NOT TO APPROVE OR REPORT ANY RESOLUTION TO ABOLISH THE HOUSE
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE.”

THE 50 SIGNATURES SUPPORTING THE SPECIAL MEETING CONSISTED
PRIMARILY OF FRESHMEN AND THE MORE LIBERAL MEMBERS OF THE MAJORITY

; DEMOCRATS.

HARRINGTON WAS ONE OF SEVERAL MEMBERS WHO PRESSED EARLY THIS YEAR
FOR CREATION OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO CHARGES THE CIA
CONDUCTED ILLEGAL DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE AND TOOK PART IN PLANNED
POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS ABROAD.

REP. LUCIEN NEDZI, D-MICH., WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN BY THE
LEADERSHIP, BUT HARRINGTON AND OTHERS COMPLAINED THAT HE WAS DOING
NOTHING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION. THEY FORCED A VOTE TO TAKE THE CIA ia
MATTER OUT OF NEDZI'S HANDS, NEDZI OFFERED HIS RESIGNATION, THE. HOUSE _
REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT, AND A RESOLUTION WAS SENT TO THE RULES =
COMMITTEE TO ABOLISH THE PANEL. ene
