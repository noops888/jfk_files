SUBJECT 2 Paeszorte of Cubano

1, Mr, Devine, of tho State Department, called on 22 June
and referred to previous discusaiona with membere of WH Division
and of WH/4 concerning Miro Cardona’s request for some 400 pa
porte of Cubans as well ae other personal documents. It waa
recalled that Miro Cardona snd Tony Varona, among othere in the
Council, had raised this question in late April and early May with
Mr. Goodwin and later with Morales Carrion, At that time it waa
understood that'these paosporte and documents were collected from
volunteers for the invasion forces in Florida ans. held possibly by
the FRO or tte "associates" under an agreement that eald passports
and documents would be turned over to no one other than the person
concerned or his heirs, It was‘also recalled by Mr. Devine that the
answer to the request of the Council for thase documanta wae that
any individual who wanted his documenta should go to the entity to
which he gave it ond make application.. It was also paesed to the
Council that the passports were in the Florida area in custody and
were immediately available to the individual or his heirs, Fora
time thie seemed to suffice or, at any rate, the inquiries seemed to

stop.

2. Apparently with Miro Cardona’s knowledge a fow days ago
a circular was prepared by some Cuban organization and sent to
all people in the Cuban community in Miami who might be Interested
in documents or passports, stating that anyone wanting to recover
said documenta should apply to Mr. Hurowitz on the Cuban desk in
the Department of State, Mr. Hurowits received in the lost day ov
two some thirty lettero requesting documents of ono Individual or
another and eventually decided to acknowledge them with a form
letter, stating that no responsibility for sald documents rested with
the Rate Department. However, the State Department would do
what it could to assist in the locating of said documente. Meanwhile

someone in State has contacted Carlos Piad on the Revolutionary
Council, and has been aasured that the circular which had been

a8 the Council's point of coordination for the recovery of said

documents.

3.: Mr, Devine would like to have ue provide him with some
more special instructions than he presontly has concerning the pro-
cedures for the recovery of the documents; also, if we can short
