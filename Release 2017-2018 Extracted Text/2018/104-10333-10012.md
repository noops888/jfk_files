A motion was made by William Joyce to accept the minutes of the October 23, 1995
Open Board Meeting. The motion was seconded by Henry Graff and passed
unanimously.

On a motion by Anna Nelson and second by William Joyce, the Board voted
unanimously to close portions of the next Board Meeting.

The proposals to change Board Procedures were discussed. Kermit Hall moved
adoption of Option 2, Part I. The motion was seconded by Henry Graff and carried 5-0.
On Part II, Kermit Hall moved adoption of Option 3, to include the existing rule in “E”
below except to change the wording to majority of “Board,” rather than “quorum.”
Rather than including “E” as part of the wording of Option 3, Dr. Hall accepted

TESTIMONY BEFORE JFK BOARD, 6 AUGUST 1996

INTRODUCTION
Introduce CIA participants

We are pleased to provide information to the Assassination
Records Review Board that might assist the Board in fulfilling
. its responsibilities under the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act. CIA is committed to full
cooperation with the Board.

Before addressing the subject of the sequestered collection
directly, I would like to provide some background to help put
the sequestered collection into some sort of context.

In the spring of 1992, prior to the enactment of the JFK
Assassination Records Act, then Director of Central
Intelligence, Bob Gates issued instructions to begin reviewing
for declassification all records related to the assassination.

The CIA History Staff was charged with identifying the
relevant records. Once this was done, the Historical Review
Group took custody of these records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to the National
Archives.

Once the Kennedy Assassination Records Act was passed, our
goal became to release as many of the records as possible by the
22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act. Approximately
125,000 pages were transferred to the National Archives by that
date.

With subsequent releases, CIA has now declassified and
transferred some 227,000 pages of material to the National
Archives. Based on discussions with the Board, we are
continuing to release additional information that had been
redacted earlier.

The remaining records are in various stages of review.
Some require review by other agencies. Some is congressional
material. Final decisions on other records are awaiting
discussion with the Review Board.



THE ASSASSINATION RECORDS

In identifying relevant records, we have followed the
definitions in the 1992 Act and the related rules which were
published in the Federal Register.

The Kennedy assassination records in CIA consist of two
major groups of files. One group consists of the documents in
the Lee Harvey Oswald file--sometimes referred to as the “Oswald
201 file”. These consist mainly of documents collected after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission investigation.

There are about 26,000 pages of material in the Oswald
file. All but a handful have been declassified and sent to the
National Archives.

The second group is comprised of the “sequestered
collection”. These are the records that were made available to
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and which the
Committee asked CIA to hold in safekeeping upon the completion
of the Committee’s investigation.

Certain additional records, including 400 excerpts from
minutes of the Director’s morning meetings, and some working
files, have been added to the overall collection since 1992.


SEQUESTERED COLLECTION

First of all, every document in the sequestered
collection is available to the Board for review. The
documents are available in full, without redactions.

The record shows that the sequestered collection
consists of documents compiled in connection with the
investigation of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA).

A portion of the documents were created specifically in
response to requests from the HSCA. Other records were
already in existence prior to the creation of the Committee.
Still other documents were created by the Committee itself.
For example, notes of interviews conducted by the
Committee’s staff.

Within the sequestered collection there are two major
categories of records. One category consists of
approximately 129,000 pages of hard copy. The second
category consists of 72 reels of microfilm, or the
equivalent of 163,000 pages of hard copy.

The reason why the documents were sequestered is
explained in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the
Chairman Louis Stokes of the HSCA and DCI Stansfield Turner
in August 1977. The Memorandum provides as follows:

“Upon termination of the Committee, all materials
provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will be kept
and preserved within a segregated and secure area within CIA
for at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of
Representatives agree to a shorter period of time.”

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff
Director of the HSCA visited CIA Headquarters to complete

the process of designating what materials were to be
sequestered. All the documents made available to the
Committee were included in the sequestered collection.



REVIEW AND DECLASSIFICATION OF THE SEQUESTERED FILES

In 1992, CIA wrote to Speaker of the House Thomas Foley
requesting approval to begin declassifying and releasing the
records. In October of that year, Mr. Foley wrote a letter
to the DCI granting CIA the authority to do so. The
Speaker's decision was made in anticipation of passage of
the Assassination Records Collection Act.

THE HARDCOPY MATERIAL

The hardcopy part of the sequestered collection
includes copies of most of the CIA documents in the Oswald
201 file. Also included are 201 files, personnel files, and
security files on persons who are mentioned in documents
relevant to the assassination, or who figure in one of the
conspiracy theories.

The collection also includes about 30,000 pages of
documents, memos, and notes (many handwritten) that were
created by the Committee staff during their investigation.


THE MICROFILM PORTION OF THE SEQUESTERED COLLECTION

As I noted earlier, there are approximately 72 reels of
microfilm in the sequestered collection. (Incidentally, we
have arranged to have all of the microfilm records printed
in hard copy.)

The decision to microfilm a portion of the sequestered
collection was apparently based on two major considerations:

First, the integrity of the sequestered records
had to be maintained.

Second, a number of the files requested by the
HSCA were active and had to be available to allow people to
continue conducting their normal activities.

The solution was. to replace certain records with
microfilm versions. These records were microfilmed during
1979-80 with the approval of the Assassinations Committee.

THE CONTENT OF THE MICROFILM

A sizeable portion of the microfilm--approximately 50
percent--duplicates the hard copy files. For example, there
are 12 reels of material from the Oswald 201 file.

The bulk of the reels consists of files on
individuals and organizations, including personnel files of
CIA employees. There are also a number of files on anti-
Castro organizations. All but a small percentage of the
materials are CIA-originated cables, dispatches, memoranda,

reports, and correspondence.

There are questions of privacy that we believe the
Board may want to consider in determining what information
is to be released to the public. Some of the records
contain, for example, medical information on an individual.

There are also questions of relevancy that we suggest
the Board consider. For example, many of the documents
cover sensitive activities that go far beyond the timeframe
of the assassination or investigations into the
assassination.


SUMMARY

--We hope that the Board has found this discussion of
the sequestered documents useful.

--We look forward to continuing cooperation with the
Board as we all work towards releasing as much information
as possible to the American public.

| am pleased to say -- and | offer this as my personal opinion -- that | have
seen no example where the Board has postponed any information that
bears directly on the assassination. | believe that the story is coming out
with the records that are being released.

Issue immediately before us is the CIA’s sequestered collection.
Mr. Pereira has described it from the perspective of the agency.

The Review Board staff has been reviewing the record and has given the
Board its own assessment of the status of the records.

There are a great number of records in the sequestered collection that are highly
relevant:

Lee Harvey Oswald

Georges de Mohrenschildt
Elena Garro de Paz

Antonio de Varona (Frente RD)
Silvia Duran

Rolando Cubela

CRC

Bay of Pigs

Castro assassination attempts
Warren Commission

HSCA

Garrison investigation


U.

-2-

These types of records need to be reviewed on the same word-to-word basis as
the board has reviewed records thus far.

But we have a new problem: how should the Board review records from the
sequestered collections where the relevance to the assassination is not clear.

Examples where the staff has difficulty finding a nexus to the
assassination in certain records.

| will offer a few examples to provide you with a flavor of some of the issues we
are confronting. The examples below are hypothetical and are loosely based
upon our review of the files in order to illustrate the issues.

A. The “false hit” category

The HSCA requested files from CIA on a great number of persons. In many
instances the agency did not know why the files were requested, and accordingly
it made available files that it had on the name that had been requested.

Because names are not always unique, the agency sometimes made available
files on individuals who were of no interest to the HSCA and who had no
identifiable relation to the assassination.

1. A very common name --- | will use as an example the name Robert Smith.
The HSCA requested Robert Smith files because of an alleged
connection between a “Robert Smith” and Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.
The Smith whose file was made available, however, was a CIA officer who
died in 1956. The ARRB staff has reviewed the file and has discovered
no relevance to the assassination.

B. CIA operational files or 201 files.

2. Cuban now living in the United States. CIA unsuccessfully attempted to
recruit her to collect information on Cuba through her family and friends,
but ultimately abandoned the effort. Neither she nor any of her hoped for
contacts had any identifiable connection to the Oswald story or to the JFK
assassination.

3. Cuban cultivated for operational work against Castro in whom CIA lost
interest when he was not able to meet operation standards.

4. Soviet official at the Mexico City embassy during Oswald's visit, although
he never had any personal contact with him. The Mexico City portion of
his file ha been reviewed and released in part to NARA. The remainder of


-3-

his file covers his subsequent career in a European country, where CIA
monitored him closely. This portion of his career - by far the largest part
of his file - has no bearing on Oswald or the JFK assassination.

C. CIA officials

There are many personnel files of CIA officers. The files often contain medical
records evaluations, recommendations, and postings. They generally do not
contain any operational details.

5.

CIA employee who was a Headquarters secretary for a major figure in the
case. Her file consists of personnel records, medical records, and a
polygraph, none of which has any identifiable bearing on the Oswald story
of the JFK assassination.

As anyone knowledgeable about the Kennedy assassination can testify, there is
a bewildering number of allegations regarding CIA officials who have alleged
connections to the assassination. The HSCA investigated some of these leads.
Not all leads are successful.

6.

A CIA officer was allegedly in Dallas on November 22. An examination of
the file suggests that the individual was not in Dallas, but was in Vietnam.
There is nothing in the file that contains any apparent connection to the
assassination.

CIA official in Mexico City who was directly involved in matters related to
Oswald's visit. Prior to and subsequent to the Mexico City tour, the officer
was stationed at headquarters and at other locations in the world. With
the exception of the portion related to Mexico City, the staff can identify no
other documents that illuminate the assassination.

D. Summary of problems

First, establishing criteria for relevance

Second, handling different types of records

ex. 1: entire file has no identifiable relevance

ex. 2: some documents in a file have relevance, but others do not

ex. 3: portion of a document has identifiable relevance, but others do not


a.

Selected Statutory Provisions in The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V
1994) :

Definition of Assassination Record

“Assassination record’ means a record that is related to the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy, that was created or made available for use
by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of [the HSCA].”
Sect. 3(2).

Interpretation 1: All records in segregated collection are assassination records.

Argument: the segregated collection are “assassination records” because
a government agency examined them in the course of their investigation
of the assassination.

Interpretation 2: Only segregated collection records that actually relate to the
assassination of President Kennedy come within the scope of the JFK Act.

Argument: In order for a record to be an “assassination record” it must:

(a) relate to the assassination of President Kennedy, and (b) have been

used by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of a

government agency. :

Selected CFR Provisions:

“All records collected by or segregated by all Federal, state, and local
government agencies in conjunction with any investigation or analysis of
or inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy... .” 36 CFR
1400.1(b)(2)

“An assassination record shall be released in its entirety except for
portions specifically postponed pursuant to the grounds for postponement
of public disclosure of records established in . . . the JFK Act, and no
portion of any assassination record shall be withheld from public
disclosure solely on grounds of non-relevance unless, in the Review
Board's sole discretion, release of part of a record is sufficient to comply
with the intent and purposes of the JFK Act.” 36 CFR 1400.5.


-5-

V. Staff Preliminary Suggestions to Board
A. Factors suggesting possible relevance to assassination:

Unfortunately, there is no simple, clear, obvious method for determining
relevance. Accordingly, rule of thumb guidelines need to be followed.
The obvious rules of thumb to assist staff in identifying relevant
documents would include:

-- documents that obviously-are related to assassination
CIA intemal investigations
Oswald records
Garrison investigation
Castro assassination attempts

-- documents falling within certain dates (relevance of dates depends on
issue under consideration
dates associated with Oswald
dates immediately around assassination
dates of Warren Commission
dates of Church Committee, HSCA investigations

-- individuals of importance
CIA officials in Mexico City
David Atlee Phillips
Win Scott
CIA officials in HQ involved in investigation
John Scelso
JJ Angleton

-- geographical relevance (USSR; Cuba; Mexico)
B.. Handling of records in sequestered collection
First, ARRB staff reviews all records and files in sequestered collection.

Second, all documents that are found to be relevant will be subjected to
word by word review of postponements by the Board. The staff will, over
time, work with the Board to establish guiding criteria for identifying
televance. The focus will be on individuals.and groups that have been
identified as playing a role in the larger story of the assassination.
Examples of individuals who have been identified as being a part of the
greater story surrounding the assassination include David Atlee Phillips,
Win Scott, James Angleton, etc. Groups include Cuban exile groups


-6-

, (DRE, Alpha 66, etc.), Minutemen, etc.

Third, for a file where no relevance can be found, the staff will write a
memorandum identifying the file, describing the review process, and
explaining the basis of finding no relevance. The staff memorandum will
then be sent to the JFK Collection and be made fully available to the
public.

Fourth, for a file containing some relevant records, the relevant records
will be subjected to the word by word review. Records for which the staff
has been able to identify no relevance, a memorandum will be written to =
describe generally the type of records and explain the basis for finding no
relevance.

Fifth, with regard to the microfilm copy of the Oswald 201 file, the staff will
review the entire file in order to determine whether there are any records
in the file that are not included in the released version of the 201 file. If
such records are identified, they will be subjected to the same word by
word review as other records -- but the remainder of the 201 file will not
be reviewed again.

Sixth, in rare cases, portions of a documerit that genuinely have no
identifiable relevance to the assassination, may be redacted consistent
with the 1400.5.

| recommend that the Board, in the near future, deliberate on the guidance that it
wishes to give to the staff regarding these matters.

MR. TILLEY: My pleasure, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Next, we have two
representatives from the Central Intelligence
Agency here today, to provide factual testimony for
the board on the nature of the sequestered
collection, Mr. John Pereira and Mr. Barry
Harrelson.

And because this is primarily a factual
presentation, we decided that we should put each of
you under oath. So, if you would, raise your right
hand and repeat after me.

[John Pereira and Barry Harrelson sworn.]

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Thank you for joining

us today.

MR. PEREIRA: A pleasure. We're pleased
to try to help and provide information that might
help the board understand the sequestered
collection. I thought, if the time allows, I might
give some background to put the sequestered

¢ollection in context for the board.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: That would be very
helpful.

MR. PEREIRA: In the spring of 1992, prior
to the enactment of the Assassination Records Act,
the then-Director of Central Intelligence, Robert
Gates, issued instructions to begin reviewing for
declassification all records related to the
assassination.

The CIA history staff was charged with
identifying the relevant records, which they did.
And once that happened, our group that we
represent, the historical review group, took
custody of the records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to
the National Archives.

Once the Records Act was passed, our goal
became to release as many records as possible by
the 22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act.
And approximately 125,000 pages were transferred to
the National Archives by that date.

With subsequent releases, the Agency has

now declassified and transferred some 227,000 pages

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002

23
to the National Archives. And based on discussions
with the Board, we’re trying to release additional
information that had been redacted earlier:

The remaining records are in various
stages of review. Some require review by other
agencies. Some is congressional material. And
final decisions on other records are awaiting
discussion with the board, as you know.

The Kennedy assassination records in the
CIA consist of two major groups of files.

One group consists of the documents in the
Lee Harvey Oswald file, sometimes referred to as
the Oswald 201 file. These consist mainly of
documents that were collected after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission
investigation. And there are about 26,000 pages of
material in this file. All but a handful have been
declassified and sent to the National Archives.

The second group is one of major interest
to you today, I think. It‘s comprised of the
sequestered collection. These are records that

were made available to the House Select Committee

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002



24
on Assassination and which the committee asked CIA
to hold in safekeeping upon the completion of the
committee's investigation.

And there are certain additional records,
including 400 excerpts from the minutes of the
director of Central Intelligence morning meetings
and some working files that have been added since
1992. But that’s pretty much the landscape of the
records we have.

By going directly to the sequestered
collection, I’d like to say that, first of all,
every document in the sequestered collection was
available to the board for review. Every document
is available in full to the board without
redactions.

A portion of the documents that were
created specifically in response to requests from
the House Assassination Committee are in the
record. Other records were already in existence

prior to the creation of the committee. And still

other documents were created by the committee

itself. For example, there are notes of interviews

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
S07 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002

tana ‘cae cree



em

25
conducted by the committee's staff.

So, these are the three categories: those
created for the committee at their request; others
that existed that we provided to them at their
request; and others that the committee itself
created.

Now, within the sequestered collection,
there are two major categories of records. This is
a simple breakdown. I hope this is helpful. One
category consists of about 129,000 pages of hard
copy. The second category consists of 72 reels of
microfilm or the equivalent of 163,000 pages of
hard copy.

Now, the question has come up of why the
documents were sequestered. And this is explained
in a Memorandum of Understanding, signed by the
chairman of the Assassination Committee and the
director of Central Intelligence. And I Have a
copy here to submit to the board.

The memorandum states that, “Upon
termination of the Committee, all materials

provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(ono) ‘sac-ccee



com

26
be kept and preserved within a segregated and
secure area within CIA for at least 30 years,
unless the DCI and the House of Representatives
agree to a shorter period of time."

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, the chief
counsel and staff director of the Assassinations
Committee, visited cIA headquarters; and he
completed the process of designating what materials
were to be sequestered. All the documents made
available to the Assassination Committee were
included in this sequestered collection.

The second question that often comes up
is, where did we get authority to start reviewing
these records prior to the Assassination Act? And
this goes back to my point about Robert Gates
wanting to get started as quickly as possible in
the review and declassification.

So, the Agency wrote to the Speaker of the
House, Thomas Foley, in 1992, requesting approval
to begin declassifying and releasing the records.
And in October of that year, Speaker Foley wrote a

letter to the director, granting CIA the authority

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
$07 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(on Gac.ceee



cm

27
to do so.

The Speaker’s decision was clearly made in
anticipation of passage of the Assassination
Records Collection Act. So, we have the records,
and we started processing.

Within the two categories that I
mentioned, the hard copy material is one. And we
have a page describing that for the board, which
I‘1l leave with you. This includes copies of most
of the CIA documents and the Oswald 201 file that I
referred to earlier.

Also included in the hard copy are other
201 files, personnel files, security files on
persons who are mentioned in documents relevant to
the assassination or who figure in one of the
conspiracy theories.

This part, the hard copy, also includes
about 30,000 pacce of documents, memos, and notes
-- many of these, handwritten -- that were created
by the Assassination Committee itself. So, those
are in the hard copy.

Now, the microfilm portion of the

sequestered collection, as I mentioned, contains 72
reels of microfilm. Incidentally, we found very
quickly that working with microfilm wasn‘t-all that
easy, so we arranged to have all of the microfilm
printed out in hard copy. So, we have both; and
both of these are available to the board, both the
microfilm itself and the printout.

The decision to microfilm was apparently
based on two major considerations, as far as we can
determine from our records. First, the integrity
of the sequestered records had to be maintained.
Second, a number of the files that the
Assassination Committee requested were active
files, and had to be available to allow people to
continue conducting their normal activities within
the Agency.

So, the solution was to replace certain
records with microfilm versions. And these records
were microfilmed during 1979 and 1980 with the

approval of the Assassinations Committee. And we

have memos for the records showing how that

happened, so that you will have the history on

that.
Now, looking at the content of the
microfilm, a sizeable portion of this -- probably
50 percent -- duplicates the hard copy in the
sequestered files. For example, there are 12 reels

of material from the Oswald 201 file.

The bulk of the reels consists of files on
individuals and organizations, including personnel
files of CIA employees. There are also a number of
files on anti-Castro organizations. All but a
small percentage are CIA-originated cables, or
dispatches, or memoranda and other documents.

In looking at the microfilm, we believe
there are questions of privacy that the board may
want to consider in determining what information is
to be released. Some of the records, for example,
contain medical information on an individual.

There are also questions of relevancy that
we suggest the board consider. For example, many
of the documents cover sensitive activities that go
far beyond the time frame of the assassination or

investigations into the assassination.

That's rather brief; but I hope this is
useful to the board in trying to understand the
sequestered documents, sometimes called segregated
documents. We use those terms interchangeably.
And we certainly look forward to continuing
cooperating with the board, with the goal of
releasing as much information as possible to the
American public.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Very well. Mr.
Harrelson, do have anything to add?

MR. HARRELSON: No.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Questions on the part
of the board? Dr. Joyce.

DR. JOYCE: Mr. Pereira, you mentioned
that 50 percent of the microfilm appears to :
duplicate what already exists in hard copy. You
mentioned the 201 file as an example of that.

Maybe I missed it, but could you
characterize perhaps the portion that appears not
to be duplicated in hard copy? Do you have any
information about that?

there would not be documents from~eieee in the hard

Most of the hard copy, apparently, was
created as the HSC staffers asked for particular

information. They would look at a file, and ask

for copies of it. The ultimate was one cable,

where we found 43 copies. So, most of #t -- I

August ‘94.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Other questions?

MS. NELSON: How much have you been able
to look at this sequestered file? It‘s enormous.
It boggles the mind, going through 72 reels of
microfilm. No wonder you printed hard copy. But I
would imagine you‘ve only done some sampling.

MR. HARRELSON: With the exception of the

looked at every page of material.

MS. NELSON: Do you have a sense of what’s
not, in your view, an assassination record? Are
there certain percentages or certain numbers of
those?

MR. PEREIRA: I think we need to defer to
the board on that. We're, suggesting certain --

MS. NELSON: Yes. That's what --

MR. PEREIRA: -- questions that the board
may address, but we are deferring completely to you

in interpreting the law. And, so, we're assuming

that every piece of paper we have that was
sequestered is potentially relevant.

MS. NELSON: Under the statute, we‘ll have
to see what that is.

MR. PEREIRA: Yes, following the statute.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM:. Any further questions?

DR. HALL: John, do you know what of these
materials the HSCA used and didn’t use?

MR. PEREIRA: There’s a -- I/’11 let Barry
comment on this, as well. There’s a little bit of
uncertainty. To go back, every record that we made
available to the committee is in the sequestered
collection.

Some of the indications are that there was
a very thorough review, obviously, by the committee
of a lot of records. My impression is that, for
other records, the committee staff requested
certain files. We provided an entire file -- let’s
say, on an individual. |

But the committee staff may have said,
“Well, this'really isn’t all that relevant to our

work, but thank you. We now know who that person

been involved, and we needed to check that name.

And in checking the name, we get the

that sort of breakdown, I think.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

FROM: John F. Pereira
Acting Director, Center for the
Study of Intelligence

SUBJECT: CIA Testimony at JFK Assassination
Board Hearing

1. This memorandum is for your information. On 6 August
1996, the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) held an
open hearing for purposes of having public discussion about
declassification of CIA's files related to the assassination.

2. The principal issue discussed at the hearing was whether
the Board needs to review word-by-word each of the more than
300,000 pages of CIA‘’s “sequestered collection”. This collection
is comprised of those records that were made available to the
House Select Committee on Assassinations during its investigation.

3. The Board's General Counsel, Jeremy Gunn, proposed that
the ARRB consider declaring a sizeable portion of the collection
as not relevant or duplicative. If the Board agrees, then the
irrelevant and duplicative materials would be examined only by
the ARRB‘S staff, thereby speeding up the review process
substantially. (The Board‘s charter expires in October, 1997,
but presumably could be extended by Congress.)

4. Two members of the Historical Review Group--Barry Harrelson
and I--testified under oath on the Agency’s considerable efforts to
fulfill its commitment to release as many assassination documents to
the public as possible. In a prepared statement, we described how
the sequestered collection was compiled originally, kept intact per
instructions from Congress, and then reviewed for release under
authority granted by then Speaker of the House Foley. We emphasized
that every document in the collection is available in full to the
Board and its senior staff. 7

5. From CIA‘s perspective, the hearing went smoothly. The
Board accepted CIA’s testimony without criticism. None of the
four public witnesses raised any serious concerns about CIA's
handling of the JFK documents. One witness--author/lawyer
Harrison Livingstone--claimed that there has been too much focus
on CIA records, and that CIA was being made the “whipping boy”.

issue immediately before us Is the CIA’s sequestered collection,

Mr. Pereira has described it from the perspective of the agency. eee

The Review Board staff has been reviewing the record and has given the
Board its own assessment of the status of the records.

There are a great number of records in the sequestered collection that are highly
relevant:

Lee Harvey Oswald

Georges de Mohrenschildt
Elena Garro de Paz

Antonio de Varona (Frente RD)
Silvia Duran

Rolando Cubela

CRC

Bay of Pigs

Castro assassination attempts
Warren Commission

HSCA

Garrison investigation


-2-

These types of records need to be reviewed on the same word-to-word basis as
the board has reviewed records thus far.

But we have a new problem: how should the Board review records from the
sequestered collections where the relevance to the assassination is not clear.

Examples where the staff has difficulty finding a nexus to the
assassination in certain records.

! will offer a few examples to provide you with a flavor of some of the issues we
are confronting. The examples below are hypothetical and are loosely based
upon our review of the files in order to illustrate the issues.

A. The “false hit” category

The HSCA requested files from CIA on a great number of persons. In many
instances the agency did not know why the files were requested, and accordingly
it made available files that it had on the name that had been requested.

Because names are not always unique, the agency sometimes made available
files on individuals who were of no interest to the HSCA and who had no
identifiable relation to the assassination.

1. A very common name --- | will use as an example the name Robert Smith.
- The HSCA requested Robert Smith files because of an alleged
connection between a “Robert Smith” and Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.
The Smith whose file was made available, however, was a CIA officer who
died in 1956. The ARRB staff has. reviewed the file and has discovered
no relevance to the assassination.

B. CIA operational files or 201 files.

2. Cuban now living in the United States. CIA unsuccessfully attempted to
recruit her to collect information on Cuba through her family and friends,
but ultimately abandoned the effort. Neither she nor any of her hoped for
contacts had any identifiable connection to the Oswald story or to the JFK
assassination.

3. Cuban cultivated for operational work against Castro in whom CIA lost
interest when he was not able to meet operation standards,

4. Soviet official at the Mexico City embassy during Oswald's visit, although

he never had any personal contact with him. The Mexico City portion of
his file ha been reviewed and released in part to NARA. The remainder of


~3-

his file covers his subsequent career in a European country, where CIA
a monitored him closely. This portion of his career - by far the largest part
of his file - has no bearing on Oswald or the JFK assassination.

C. CIA officials

There are many personnel files of CIA officers. The files often contain medical
records evaluations, recommendations, and postings. They generally do not
contain any operational details.

5. CIA employee who was a Headquarters secretary for a major figure in the
case. Her file consists of personnel records, medical records, anda
polygraph, none of which has any identifiable bearing on the Oswald story
of the JFK assassination.

As anyone knowledgeable about the Kennedy assassination can testify, there is
a bewildering number of allegations regarding CIA officials who have alleged
connections to the assassination. The HSCA investigated some of these leads.
Not all leads are successful.

6. ACIA officer was allegedly in Dallas on November 22. An examination of
the file suggests that the individual was not in Dallas, but was in Vietnam.
There is nothing in the file that contains any apparent connection to the
assassination. seciaananeaunataant es

7. CIA official in Mexico City who was directly involved in matters related to
Oswald's visit. Prior to and subsequent to the Mexico City tour, the officer
was stationed at headquarters and at other locations in the world. With
the exception of the portion related to Mexico City, the staff can identify no
other documents that illuminate the assassination.

D. Summary of problems
First, establishing criteria for relevance
Second, handling different types of records
ex. 1: entire file has no identifiable relevance
ex. 2: some documents in a file have relevance, but others do not

ex. 3: portion of a document has identifiable relevance, but others do not

Selected Statutory Provisions in The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V
1994)

Definition of Assassination Record

“Assassination record’ meafris a record that is related to the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy, that was created or made available for use
by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of [the HSCA].”
Sect. 3(2).

Interpretation 1: All records in segregated collection are assassination records.

Argument: the segregated collection are “assassination records” because
a government agency examined them in the course of their investigation
of the assassination.

Interpretation 2: Only segregated collection records that actually relate to the
assassination of President Kennedy come within the scope of the JFK Act.

Argument: In order for a record to be an “assassination record” it must:
(a) relate to the assassination of President Kennedy, and (b) have been
used by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of a
goverment agency. -

Selected CFR Provisions:

“All records collected by or segregated by all Federal, state, and local
goverment agencies in conjunction with any investigation or analysis of
or inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy... .” 36 CFR
1400.1 (b)(2)

“An assassination record shall be released in its entirety except for
portions specifically postponed pursuant to the grounds for postponement
of public disclosure of records established in . . . the JFK Act, and no
portion of any assassination record shall be withheld from public
disclosure solely on grounds of non-relevance unless, in the Review
Board's sole discretion, release of part of a record is sufficient to comply
with the intent and purposes of the JFK Act.” 36 CFR 1400.5.


-5-

V. Staff Preliminary Suggestions to Board
A. Factors suggesting possible relevance to assassination:

Unfortunately, there is no simple, clear, obvious method for determining
relevance. Accordingly, rule of thumb guidelines need to be followed.
The obvious rules of thumb to assist staff in identifying relevant
documents would include: :

-- documents that obviously are related to assassination
CIA intemal investigations
Oswald records |
Garrison investigation i
Castro assassination attempts

-- documents falling within certain dates (relevance of dates depends on
issue under consideration
dates associated with Oswald
dates immediately around assassination
dates of Warren Commission
dates of Church Committee, HSCA investigations

-- individuals of importance
CIA officials irr Mexico City
David Atlee Phillips
Win Scott
CIA officials in HQ involved in investigation
John Scelso
JJ Angleton

-- geographical relevance (USSR; Cuba; Mexico)

B. Handling of records in sequestered collection
First, ARRB staff reviews all records and files in sequestered collection.

Second, all documents that are found to be relevant will be subjected to
word by word review of postponements by the Board. The staff will, over
time, work with the Board to establish guiding criteria for identifying
relevance. The focus will be on individuals and groups that have been
identified as playing a role in the larger story of the assassination.
Examples of individuals who have been identified as being a part of the
greater story surrounding the assassination include David Atlee Phillips,
Win Scott, James Angleton, etc. Groups include Cuban exile groups

oO


. if ; -6-

(DRE, Alpha 66, etc.), Minutemen, etc.

Third, for a file where no relevance can be found, the staff will write a
memorandum identifying the file, describing the review process, and
explaining the basis of finding no relevance. The staff memorandum will
then be sent to the JFK Collection and be made fully available to the
public. :

Fourth, for a file containing some relevant records, the relevant records
will be subjected to the word by word review. Records for which the staff
has been able to identify no relevance, a memorandum will be written to
describe generally the type. of records and explain the basis for finding no
relevance.

Fifth, with regard to the microfilm copy of the Oswald 201 file, the staff will
review the entire file in order to determine whether there are any records
in the file that are not included in the released version of the 201 file. If
such records are identified, they will be subjected to the same word by
word review as other records -- but the remainder of the 201 file will not
be reviewed again.

Sixth, in rare cases, portions of a document that genuinely have no
identifiable relevance to the assassination, may be redacted consistent
with the 1400.5.

| recommend that the Board, in the near future, deliberate on the guidance that it
wishes to give to the staff regarding these matters.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

1g Aveyss (At

I, Preparation of Materials

A, The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will cooperate fully
in the investigations conducted by the Select Committee on Assassinations
(Committee) by providing access, as requested, to classified information
within the releasing authority of the CIA, and held by the CIA, that bears
upon the study and investigation authorized by H. Res. 222. CIA will
notify the Committee of any requested information held by CIA not
within the releasing authority of the CIA, and notify the Committee of the
proper authority to contact to obtain the information. No document ora
portion of the document in the possession of CIA will be withheld without
written notice of that action to the Committee. Access to all classified
information designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the
Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and currently held by any federal
agency or department shall be governed by this memorandum.

B. Documentary material will be made available as expeditiously
and completely as feasible, subject to the responsibility of the DCI to
protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods. The Committee and
CIA will periodically agree upon a list of identities that will not be excised
from materials turned over to the Committee. Subject to the list of
identities that will not be deleted, CIA will appropriately sanitize, including
excising if necessary, information to assure protection of information
identifying sensitive sources and methods, When an excision is made,

CIA will indicate the nature of the source or method excised, including the
functional intelligence discipline which was the source of the intelligence.

C, The Chief Counsel of the Select Committee on Assassinations
and a designated representative of the DCI shall meet monthly to discuss
a random sample of the complete and unsanitized materials selected by
the Chief Counsel for the purpose of verifying the appropriateness of the
sanitizing done by the CLA. Those matters on which they do not agree
shall be referred to the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and the
DCI for resolution. :


D. fa making any excisions or other alterations of requested
materials, CIA shall be bound by 18 U.S. Xe Subsection 1505 and all
other applicable statutes.

fl, Request Procedure

A. The CIA element responsible for dealing with the Committee
is the Coordination and Review Staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel
(C&RS/OLC). All Committee requests for information will be conveyed
to CIA only via the Coordination and Review Staff. Absent extraordinary
circumstances, appointments with CLA employees and former employees
will be arranged through the Coordination and Review Staff. »

Be AU Committed requests for information will be in writing.
In the interest of timely response, C&RS/OLC will accept preliminary
telephone or other oral requests, but no information can be made
available until a request is received in writing from the Chief
Counsel or one of the Deputy Chief Counsels.

li, Staff Clearance

Prior to access by Committee personnel to any material which
has been designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the
DCI, such Committee personnel will be granted security clearance
by the Committee after consultation with the CLA, Committee personnel
requiring access to such material will be required to execute, in advance,
the attached Select Committee on Assassinations Nondisclosure Agreement.

IV. Transcripts of Statements Under Oath

A steno-typist from either the Committee or the CIA will make a
verbatim record of all statements of current CIA personnel taken under
oath. One copy of the record will be made available to the Committee
and Bene other to the CIA in accordance with the Rules of Committee.

ve "Examination of Material

Materials to which access has been granted by CIA will be reviewed
in a CIA reading room set aside for this purpose or in a designated area
within the Committee's offices.

VI. Storage of Materials

A. Committee procedures for control and storage of any documents
or materials provided by the CIA which require protection will follow
security standards and procedures established in consultation with, and
approved by, the CIA.


tear. ¢ oe C

. B. | Upon the termination of the Committee, all materials
provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will be kept and
preserved within a segregated and secure area within CIA for
at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of Representatives
agree to a shorter period of time. All persons having access to such
materials must sign an access sheet indicating the date, the name of the
person receiving access, the specific documents or materials to which
access was granted, and the person who authorized the access.

VU. Disclosure of Information

A. The Committee will notify the DCI in writing of its desire to
disclose, in any manner, including under the Select Committee on
Assassinations Nondisclosure Agreement, any information that is
designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the DCI.

If within five days the Committee does not receive a letter from the
DCI objecting to the proposed disclosure and stating the reasons for the
objection, the Committee may disclose the information.

B. If the DCI notifies the Committee within five days that he objects
to the proposed disclosure and states the reasons for his objections,
the Chairman of the Committee and the DCI, or their designated
representatives, shall.meet to attempt to resolve any differences over the
information to be disclosed. If the Chairman of the Committee considers.
that the negotiations have reached an impasse, he will give the DCla
written notice to that effect, and the Committee will take no steps until
at least 14 days thereafter to disclose the information in dispute.

*C. <Any differences left unresolved by negotiation may become the
subject of litigation. .In any such action each party will be free to assert
D all its constitutional, statutory, or other legal rights, and the parties
agree to be bound by the final outcome of any such action, If such an
action is commenced by the Executive Branch but is disposed of without
a judicial decision on the merits of the disclosure issue, the Committee
agrees that it will not on that basis, or on the basis of its 14-day notice
letter, disclose the information in dispute. This Agreement, however,
is without prejudice to any of the Committee's other rights, privileges
and responsibilities concerning the production by legal compulsion and
disclosure of information, and the DCI's rights, privileges and responsi~
bilities concerning the protection from disclosure of the information.

ISS/00A

FROM : Rodger S. Gabrielson
Office of Legislative Counsel”

SUBJECT HSCA Records

1. Ouring the course of the HSCA investigations, much classified
information was assembled in response to HSCA requests. Three categories
of. information must: now be disposed of under terms of the HSCA/DCI °
i#émorandum of Understanding.

Category la: Classified material from Agency
holdings, requested by the HSCA, which HSCA staff
members reviewed.

Category 1b: Classified material from Ayency
holdings, requested by the HSCA, but which HSCA
staff members did not review.

Category 2: Material generated by the HSCA from
Agency classified holdings made available to the
HSCA in response to the latter's request. (Note:
This HSCA material is considered by the HSCA as its
property and, therefore, not releasable to the
public under the Freedom of Information Act. An
inventory of this material received from HSCA has
been completed.)

Category 3: Classified correspondence and certain
unclassified correspondence exchanged be*ween this
Agency and the H3sCA.

2. The HSCA has indicated its desire that copies of these taree
