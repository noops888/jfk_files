GOC WOULD NOT MAKE A FIRM DECISION UNTIL 2 NOVEMBER, SINCE THE

COURT'S FINDINGS ARE DUE FOR PRESENTATION ON 1 NOVEMBER. (FIELD

COMMENT: ON 29 OCTOBER THE LOCAL PRESS INDICATED THAT THE COURT'S

DECISION WOULD BE MADE DURING THE WEEK OF 1 NOVEMBER.)

2.

THE CUBAN OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT

ORLANDOT B

OSCH, LUISEOS A DA, HERNANCARDO, AND

*'U GO, THE FOUR DETAINEES, WOULD BE RELEASED BY THE

VENEZUELANS. DAVIDANO RA LE STBELLO, A LEADER OF THE DEMO -

CRATIC ACTION PARTY (AD), THE CUBANS SAID, WANTS THE FOUR MEN RE-

LEASED. ONE OF MORALES' LAW ASSOCIATES IS A GOOD FRIEND OF JUDGE

DELTA E ST

A BA, WHO IS HEARING THE CASE, AND MORALES' REQUEST

FOR THE RELEASE OF THE FOUR IS BEING MADE VIA THIS LAW ASSOCIATE.

(SOURCE COMMENT: THE CUBANS DID NOT ELABORATE ON THE REASON

MORALES WANTED THE MEN RELEASED, NOR DID THEY IDENTIFY THE LAW

ASSOCIATE.)

3. BOSCH, THE CUBANS SAID, WOULD PROBABLY BE TURNED OVER TO

UNITED STATES AUTHORITIES. SHOULD BOSCH BE FLOWN OUT OF VENEZUELA

VIA PANAMA, THE CUBANS SAID, THE GOC WOULD TAKE BOSCH OFF THE PLANE

IN PANAMA REGARDLESS OF WHICH AIRLINE IS USED TO TRANSPORT HIM.

IN ANY EVENT, THE CUBAN OFFICIALS INSISTED THAI, IF THE FOUR MEN

WERE PLEASED, THEY WOULD BE KILLED. THE CUBANS SAID THAT

VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, AND THE

CUBAN EXILES ALL HAVE REASON TO WISH THE FOUR DEAD AS A MEANS OF

KEEPING THEM QUIET. THE CUBAN OFFICIALS SAID THAT THE CUBAN

GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO KILL THEM, UNLESS ANOTHER GROUP DID IT

FIRST. THE CUBANS SAID THAT NO MATTER WHICH GROUP ACTUALLY

CARRIED OUT THE ASSASSINATIONS, EVERYONE WOULD BELIEVE THE CUBANS

WERE RESPONSIBLE. THE FOUR MEN, THE CUBANS SAID, MUST PAY FOR

THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE, SHOULD THEY GO FREE, OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR

GROUPS WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO ATTACK CUBANS ANYWHERE. (FIELD

COMMENT: FOR AN EARLIER REPORT ON CUBA'S INTENTIONS TOWARDS THOSE

IMPLICATED IN THE CUBANA CRASH SEE

522, TDFIRDB-315/10534-76,

OF 21 OCTOBER, FROM THE SAME SOURCE.)

4. WHILE THE OFFICIAL CUBAN COMMUNITY IN CARACAS HAS ALWAYS

BEEN CAUTIOUS, SINCE THE CUBANA ATTACK THEIR PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN

INCREASED. THE CUBAN OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE AMBASSADOR, CURRENTLY

CARRY TWO PISTOLS AT ALL TIMES. A LARGE CALIBER PISTOL IS CARRIED

IN MEN'S PURSES, WHICH ARE FASHIONABLE IN CARACAS. A SMALLER

CALIBER PISTOL IS CARRIED IN THEIR BELTS.
