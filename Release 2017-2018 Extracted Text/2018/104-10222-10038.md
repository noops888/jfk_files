performance of duty in the Organization, and laccept the obligations and con-

ditions of that service which are determined to be essential to the furtherance of

its mission.

of the security requirements inherent in my employment by the Organization:

I am also aware that as a member of the Career Staff, it will be my obligation

to serve anywhere and at any time and for any kind of duty as determined by

the needs of the Organization and I have been assured that in order to carry

out this policy, full consideration will be given to my particular capabilities, in-

terests, and personal circumstances. By virtue of this application for mamber-

ship and upon my acceptance in the Coreer Staff, I am assured that, with con

tinuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part, just and equila.

ble attention will be accorded my personal progress during my tenure in the

possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall be entitled to the

This early environent and training has, probably without

Subject's being aware of 1t, caudad him to expect of others a devotion to duty

and self discipline which Is rarely to be found.

Tese high atandards have

caused Subject to discount to some degrue the abilitios of the cloriel staft

and, to a lesser dogree, other junior personnel.

l. A second weakness probably resulta from Subject's consistently succesa

fal career.

He has, without any effort on his own part, frequently 1f not

Invariably found hinelf closely aasociated with raanagement" and regarded by

the management as beine unusually talented.

This has caused him to expect

his work to receive special attention nich is not alvays varranted. When this

does not happen, he tands to pout.

There is no question in the writor's mind but that Subject would be

an outstanding addition to any office in the Agency.

1. Subject has completed a tro-year tour at VOH and after home leave

has returned here for another two years.

2. Subject has a notably orderly mind, unusual intelligence, and a r

markable intercat in his work.

He is able to handle a variety of tasks at

one time. Although Subject has had a variety of agent-handling experiences

We bellove this will rivo him the

experience and depth necessary to support his alrendy good theorotical knowledgo.

Subject is extremely well disciplined porsonally. Unfortunatoly

tically, he sometimos expects other persons lo have similar sel alscipline. s

He also tends in other rays to disregard the human elements ever prosent in
