2. Subject’s weaknesses, which because of his outstanding ability and
promise are rather magnified in thie assessment, lie mainly in his occasionally
faulty husan relations. Subject rejecte much of the social life which is

customarily associated (although ‘not necessarily for the best) with Kubark
ata, aide from his work, are primarily intellectual

field posta. ;
and artistic. rests, coupled with his at best pro forma fulfilling
of the customary Kubark social protocols, definitely enka ie Felationship

with the rest of the etaff.———--

when vary young. This early environment and training has, probably witnont
jubject's -being avare of 1t, caused hin to expect-of others a devotion to duty -

and self discipline which is rarely to be found. These high standards have

caused Subject to discount to some degree the abilities of the clerical staff

and, to a lesser degree, other junior personnel.

be A second weakness ‘probably results from Subject's consistently euccess~ |
fal career, He has, without any effort on his om part, frequently if not \
Anvariably found himself closely associated with. "nerageasnt" and regarded by
the “management” as being unusually talented. This has caused him to expect
his work to receive special attention which is not always warranted, When this

does not happen, he tends to pout.

5. There is no question in the writer's mind but what Subject would be
an outstanding addition to any office in the Agency. He has, as far as can be
seen vow, an unlimited growth potential. His minor faults will correct them~

selves with maturity and increasing experience,

2. Subject’ has a notably orderly mind, unugual intelligence, and a re-
markable intercst in his work. He 15 able to handle a variety of taska at
one times Although Subject has had a variety of agent-handling experience,

We beliove this will rive hiv the
experience and depth necessary to Support his already good theoretical knowledge.
Subject 19 extremoly well disciplined porsonally. Unfortunately,and unrealis~
tically, he sometimes expects other persons to have aimilar sel(@disciplines

He also tends in other vays to dinregard the human elements ever présent in
intelligence operations. However, there 19 no question in my mind but @hat
additional experience will cure both of these very minor faults.
