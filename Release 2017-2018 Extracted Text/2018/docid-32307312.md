SAMUEL M. GIANCANA

On June 17, 1959, Tony Horton, Potential Criminal
Informant, advised that he has reason to believe that
Giancana and other syndicate members are attempting to
corner the bail bond business in Chicago and other large

x cities. In this connection, Horton was contacted by Mike
Brodkin, a syndicate lawyer in Chicago, in order to feel
out his, the informant's, attitude toward allowing the
outfit to take over the bonding business of the colored
section in Chicago. In order to do this, it would become
necessary for Giancana to visit with Ed and GeorgsKlones,
former Negro policy wheel operators on Chicago's South —-. be |
Side,, who are now in Mexico City. The informant said that ,
the son of an Italian hoodlum, whose name he, annot
recall, has recently spent some time with nay ones in
Mexico. According to the informant, Jones has been to kL
Switzerland on frequent occasions, but he does not know for
what reason.

SUBJECT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND H
DANGEROUS.
