On the basis of information set out im rerepyand in the
report of SA Russel F. Sullivan dated 6/7/63 at New York, it is ~
suggested that the following lines of investigation, in\addition to
the other investigation which is\now under way, be pursued to a
proper conclusion. an \

\ ,

New York PCI John Strong advised that Tom Benny, "Bull" Kenny
and "Borky” Daley, friends ofThowns J, Reynolds, afte strong-arm sen
and earry guns. It appears that the only investigation which
hag been conducted is aa interview with Thomas Kenny ‘set cut on
page 216 of rerep. According to this individual, “Borky” Daley ,
died several years ago. No information was developed nor was
any investigation conducted concerning “Bull” Kemnay. It is suggested
that inquiries be made in an effort to verify the death of "Porky"
Daley; that "Sull” Kenny be identified, lecated and interviewed; we
that staterents be obteined fvom hin and Thomas Kenny as te their where-
abouts during the pertinent period and that investigation be conducted
to verify or refute the alibis that they furnish. Efferts should be
made to determine further whether these individuals have been known to
carry guns. IZ so, the guns should be located and considered as

possible suspect weapons in connection with the shooting of
Glockner,

Similar investigation should be conducted with respect to
Richie Barrett and Tommy Clark, former employees of the Quinn Freight
Lines who, according to Joseph Mitchell Smith, are closely associated
with Reynolds. Smith also said that Barrett usually carries a
pistol. &fforts alse should be made to verify Smith's statement
that Nunzio Provenzano reportedly was seen giving money te Barrett
and Clark. If this can be substantiated the reason’ for Nunzio
Provenzano paying these individuals should be determined.

With respect to the gum involved in the murder of Glockner,
it is noted that the laboratory report of the New Jersey State
Bolice, set out on pages 306 and 307 of rerep, did not state the
make of weapon used in the murder or the probable make of this
weapon. For the information of Newark and New York, the FBI Labora-
tory has advised that from descriptive data set out in the mentioned
laboratory report it appears that the bullets would have been fired
from a €olt revolver chambered for .38 caliber Smith and Wesson
cartridges. This opinion is based 6n the fact that the rifling
characteristics are six lands and‘ grooves with a lefthand twist.

The possibility also should not be overlooked that some Spanish made
vevolvers may have similar rifling characteristics. :

Newark and New York should consider the feasibility of
examining pistol permits issued by local authorities in an effort
to determine whether any permits were issued to officials or members
of Local 560 or their associates for a .38 caliber Colt revolver.

Ef so, consideration should be given-to endeavoring to lecate the
weapons in order that test specimens may be fired from them.

Investigation should be made te determine whether Angelo
Sporaco, reported by NK2282-C as a strong-arm man for the union and
as having visited the office of Teamsters Local 810 in New York City
twice during the week prior to 5/24/63 accompanied by Nunzio
Provenzano and Sal Briguglio, was involved in the murder of Glockner.
Sporaco's whereabouts during the pertinent period should be ascer-
tained and necessary investigation conducted to verify or refute his
alibi.
