on Soviet: hunting clubs. He never belonged to one, and had been
hunting ony once in his life. His opinion was that it was not worth
my trouble to come see him in person and that anything else he might
say on the subject would be a "poor guess."

2. Bob Steele called about :1h45 to say a been
hit on the subject of hunting clubs, and could contribute ni .
At the age of 1 he had known a hunter, but that was the extent of his
knowledge of the sport. According to Bob, he added nothing further

except to express the opinion that a hunting club would not be connected
directly to a factory.
