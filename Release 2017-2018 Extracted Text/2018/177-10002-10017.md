DRAFT BRIEFING NOTES 18 February 1963
RIVAL FORCES IN LATIN AMERICAN SUBVERSION
EEE Lee a

I. Since the October crisis, Fidel Castro has obviously
been trying to straddle the rift between Moscow and
Peiping over global Communist strategy. As Mr. Martin
aptly put it yesterday, Castro's heart is in Peiping
but his stomach is in Moscow.

II. This same split between all-out militancy and a more
cautious policy--call it coexistence or "two steps
forward, one step back"~-is reflected on the extreme
left in many Latin American countries.

III, Thus Cuba at present not only seeks to serve two mas-
ters, but choose among rival servants in its Latin
American subversion.

A. Castro's views on what..is good for socialism and
revolution in Latin America. are more in line with
those of the Chinese Communists than the Soviets.
1. Latin American delegates to the East Ger-

man Party Congress last month told one of
our high-level and reliable agents in the
Communist party on their return that most
Latin American Communist party representa-
tives strongly supported the position of

the USSR regarding the differences between

it and China. . Both the Cuban and Venezuelan
representatives took a "neutral position,"
that is, they did not support the Soviets.
((Veteran high-level Venezuelan Communist,
FALN leader, from Venezuelan delegate to
the congress.))

2. Last summer a group of dissident Brazilian
Communists who had split off from the regu-
lar party went to Cuba to seek Castro's sup-
port for their movement. .According to one
of our established sources among the dissi-
dents ((former Central Committee member of
regular party, now on dissident central com-
mittee)), they got it. Castro advised them
to organize guerrilla activities and launch
a revolution as quickly as possible. He
reportedly told the group that powerful
revolutionary movements were being built
up in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and
Peru.

3. The activities of the splinter-group Com-
munists has so rankled the regular party
that its leader, Luiz Carlos Prestes, a

veteran in the Communist movement in Latin

SECRET

America, left on 7 February on a trip to
Moscow, Prague, and Havana to build a
counter-fire against:.the dissidents. Ac-
cording to two reliable covert sources in
the regular party ((members of' national com-
mittee on organization and member of the

Sao Paulo state committee)), Prestes planned

to stop in Prague to arrange with the Chi-
nese Communist Ambassador there to send two
representatives to Peiping to make a direct
complaint about support being given by Com-
munist China to the splinter group. Prestes
plans to stop on his way back in Havana ‘to
discuss Cuban support for that same splinter
group. While in Moscow he reportedly will
discuss the Sino-Soviet ideological differ-
ences and assure the Soviets of his party's
support.

B. Only the Cuban and Venezuelan Communist parties
are totally committed to terror and revolution. Else-
where in Latin America the Communist parties of-
ficially support more moderate Soviet views but
there are serious dissensions among some of the
leaders and within the membership. The Cuban mis-

sile crisis exacerbated these differences.

1. ‘The Brazilian case is the only clear split
so far noted in the major Latin American
parties, but the Paraguayan Communists have
just conducted a purge of some 34 members
and leaders for deviationist thinking.

2. The Ecuadorean Communist Party has dis-
owned two leaders who have attempted to
organize guerrilla bands without party sanc-~
tion. One of them, Manuel Araujo Hidalgo,
returned “in early 1962 from a trip to China
where he reportedly received some support.

3. Other parties have these problems as well.
There are many impatient leaders and more
followers who want to get on immediately .
with revolutionary economic, social and
political reform.

IV. In spite of differences over tactics and timing be-
tween various Communist groups, all intend eventually
to deliver the Latin American countries into the Com-
munist-socialist bloc. The so-called Soviet "conserva-
tive" view, as it is now espoused, is more intent on
trying. to achieve power by legal means if possible and

by subversion rather than by force.

Chile represents an inviting opportunity for the

Communists to take power legally.

1.

The present outlook’ is that there is at

least an even chance for election of an
anti-US, Communist coalition government in
1964,

The Communist party, legal in Chile, is a
small but influential factor in the organized
opposition to President Allesandri'’s con-
servative government. The Communists effec-
tively control the left-wing coalition of
Communists, Socialists and National Democrats.
Socialist Senator Salvador Allende is this
coalition's presidential candidate in the
1964 elections. He was defeated by only a
narrow margin in the 1958 election.

This coalition has increased its popular sup-

port since 1958 by advocating wage increases

and social reform projects vetoed by Ales-

sandri on orthodox economic grounds,

From the Soviet point of view other Latin Ameri-

can countries also appear to be drifting in the

right direction.

abe In Brazil an increasing number ‘of leftists
have been appointed to positions of impor-
tance in the government. The government
has recently been loosening its traditional
ties with the United States and has shown
signs of heading into the "neutralist" camp.
Its dire economic straits make it ‘a likely
target for expanded Bloc economic exploita-~
tion.

2. Bolivia has been controlled by a leftist
movement since the sweeping revolution of
1952. The government continually shows
favoritism to Communists. Vice President
Juan Lechin, recently made Ambassador to
Italy, has maintained “liaison with the Com-
munist party over the past year. .He is a
leading contender in the presidential elec-
tion to be held in 1964.

3. In Argentina the extremely unstable politi-
cal and economic situations provide an ideal
atmosphere for the type of coalition maneu-
vering in which Soviet-influenced Communists

engage.

Vv. Direct Soviet interest in Latin America is clearly
increasing.

A. An excellent ‘example of this was the setting up
early in 1962 of a Latin American Institute in
the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

1. The avowed purpose of this institute is to
raise the study of the problems of Latin
America, which in their own statements the
Soviets claim they have neglected, to the
highest possible level.

2. Teaching of Spanish and Portuguese languages
is to be stressed in the institute and through-
out the school system.

3. A list of subjects on which this institute
intends to publish shows that it is to be
used to attack the Alliance for Progress; it
has already attacked the Alliance program in
Colombia--a showpiece of the Alliance.

4, We have been reliably informed that posters
have been placed in some Colombian universi-
ties referring to the problems of the "na-
tional liberation and workers' movements in
Latin American countries" as topics which
will be studied by the institute. Results

of these studies will be published in the

-7~

SECRET

Docld:32205164 Page 8

near future in a magazine called America
Latina, intended especially for distribu-
tion in Latin America.

5. A pamphlet, apparently to be distributed
by the institute, and entitled Alianza para
el Progreso, will in the words of its
heralds, “unmask the economic expansion of
the USA" in Latin America.

6. The institute expects to enter into close
contact with the principal Latin American
Scientists and academicians during 1963.

VI. One of the most important Communist assets in Latin
America is large number of Bloc diplomatic and Cuban
missions. These missions are used to further Com-
munist subversive activities even in countries where
there are no Bloc diplomatic missions.

A. As can be Seen on this map the USSR, and in some
cases some Satellites as well, have diplomatic
missions in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.
The USSR maintains relations with Bolivia but has
no resident mission there, Cuba maintains em-
bassies in Mexico, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, and
Chile. The Chinese Communists, of course, have

no diplomatic ties in Latin America except with

-8-

oe SECRET

Cuba. That fact alone would make Cuban missions
important to the Chinese. Only seven Latin
American countries--Chile, the Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, and
Peru--have no official ties whatever with any
bloc country.

B. Uruguay offers a good example of how the Commu-
nists misuse diplomatic missions and the impor-
tance the Communists attach to them.

1. We have found that Communist subversive ac-
tivities in Uruguay are not now aimed at pro-
moting revolutionary activity against the
government. In this case even the Cubans
appear to be much more interested in retain-
ing the good will of the government so that
they can continue to use the country as a
base of operations against Argentina, Para-
guay, etc.

2. Communist diplomatic missions, however, are
active in supporting local Communists and
other pro-Castro groups to retain enough
leverage within the country so as to pre-
vent the anti-Castro groups from forcing a
break in relations. The badly split Uru-

guayan government itself is anti-Communist,

but is highly tolerant of the activities
of these missions and of the Uruguayan
party itself.

3. The USSR, most of the Satellites, and Cuba
all have diplomatic missions in Montevideo--
some 70 or so bloc personnel. In addition,
couriers and travellers can go back and
forth between this city and the bloc coun-

tries and Cuba at any time.

CONCLUSIONS

I. I should like to conclude with a word of caution.
Some of the information I have given you is al-
ready public knowledge, but I have attempted to
include as much pertinent information as I can
without jeopardizing valuable assets and important
operations.

II. We are working with the Department of State to de-
termine how much of the information available to
us can be made public through some appropriate
channel in order to make plain the Cuban threat
to Latin America. In the case of certain informa-
tion from clandestine sources, we are attempting
to manipulate it to the surface without exposing
our agents. We have informed our stations of the
importance this government attaches to exposing
Cuban operations.

III. I am sure, however, that you gentlemen can realize
the sensitivity of information which comes from
high-level penetrations of Communist parties, and
the vital importance to the United States of con-

tinued protection of these men.
