We feel we should disseminate this data since

we have previously dissominated the information we received

from Yuri Nosenko regarding the assassination even though

we recognized some of the data was not subject to proof,

particularly, that occurting within the soviet Union.

We feel that by documenting.

Jas a "confidential S)

informant, contact with whom has been insufficient to

establish his reliability," we will alert other agencies

that the information has not been established as true.

He have received information from numerous other

sources that the Soviets did mourn the death of President

Kennedy and that Soviet leaders felt they could work with

President Kennedy.

ACTION:

II you approve, we wit, disseminate the deta turnished

by the

informant as set out herein to the Department,)
