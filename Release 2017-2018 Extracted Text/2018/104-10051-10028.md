iD for C

3 Eaplnosa Allegations

Sensitivity: Regardless of accuracy, they

A. present a problem because of their having been
presented to other governuent agencias;

B. in view of matters touching on U.S. security,

are delicate and could have unfavorable repercussions
42 repeated to newsmen by the complainant or his
associates (shose independent, previous threats were
of greater potential embarrassment);

C. affect the reputations and the security of our
personnel at

Action: In view of the foregoing, the allegations

A. should be put in proper perspective - l.e., not
ignored because of the potential embarrassment bat
considered in the light of what we already know {
(Almost all of them are repetitions of previous
known well to

adquarters officera
concerned with the A group, whose members’
reliability, repatations and good faith are
able. Tvo of the charges - about Earle and
and about AMYHIP-1 and CARRILLO - are new.);

B. should be treated so as to proteet us against any
charge of lagity and so as to establish the facets pat, no
at the same time, treated so as to avoid attributing
to them more importance than they deserve;

Cc, should be kept in mina as e:

charges which may betandied about and reported by the

AMLASH group to other governmental agencies or to

D. should be examined together with all the other
available reports so that we may

(2) clarify our own objectives and wishes with
xespect to all the AMLASH group (and this includes
AMWHIP) ;

(2) sort out which people, if any, are worth our
time in the future;

(3) take appropriate measures, including inter-
rogation and polygraphing, to clarify doubts and
then, when necessary, terminate those who are
vorking for us but are not worthwhile;

(4) tighten up our own operational and security
procedures in connection with the AMLASH group.
As pointed out in a preliminary

3. Preli einer Analy:
analysis of the A made in March 1965 when I was

preparing for travel to| an connection wlth the QUHOPS-1
case: “...There is no convincing evidence that the group is
working either for or against the regine of Fidel CASTRO.
Reports on their contacts with us and their discussions among
themselves are at variance. In 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly
knowing that they were plotting against him, talked to AMLASH-1
and seven members of his group to enlist their sxpport against
Anibal ESCALANTE Dellunde and the communists ia Cuba. Possibly
they are playing both ends against the middle. ‘fney certainly
have been and are in contact with the two ends." The following
comments are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AMLASH conspiracy ~- As detailed by[_ 3716
(IN 28634) on 6 April 1965, QUSPORT-2 reporting on a meeting

of the ANLASH group, including AMMHIP-1 mentioned the following
significant points:

(1) KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around tor
years” without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

(2) the group was to be prepared to denouace
ODYOKE as responsible if the operation fails and believed that
the resulting scandal would rake the Day of Pigs seem insigni-
fiecant; and /

(3) AMLASH-3 was in touch with Cuban Intelligence
as established by coded messages which he ex ted.

As reported by 1532 (IN 82929) on 4 June_1965, based on
meetings with ESPINOSA, the problem seen by is that

0003667



"the AMLASH clrele is wide and each new friend of whom we leara
seems to have knowledge of the plan." I believe that the
‘problem is 3 more serious and basic one. As indicated in
paragraph 3 of the present memorandum, Fidel RO binselz
reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the 2 was plotting
against him and, knowing it, enlisted its support. Hence ve
cannet rule out’ the possibility of provocation. Assassination,
obviously, 18 a dangerous game, not merely to the plotters in

a physical sense, but to a sponsoring governmeat which may
suifer severe political repercussions at home and abroad 3£ its
involvement is made known, In the instant case, the risks of
exposure of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, Whether there is
& provocation or not. Considering the individuals whe are
involved directly, their contacts with KUBARX ofZicers,and their
reported plan to expose ODYOKE, persisting in the plaa could

be highly embarrassing to KUBARK. (This is cven more the case
now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODENVY and ODURGS, although
fortunately the tenor of his complaint was that KUBARK had not
given adequate support to the plan.)

B. The contacts at and the uatters affecting
the The "recruitment" of kad been the
subject of an exchange of cables between and Headaaarters
and_o? discussions at Headquarters between VH/C and VE (See
573 (IN 66557) and DIR-20955). The annoying thing in
this connection now is that ESPINOSA has talked about if to
ODENVY and ODURGE and the danger that, if he is indisereet,
his story about this {and the other matters). could reach some
curious newspaperman. (in this connection, it apoears that. the
questionable decision to put 3 ith the AMLASH
group was wade without the knowledge of STOCEVCOD.) ESPINOSA
did not report any criticism of the KUBARXers b
is evident that the AMLASH group knows more asoat then
we might wish. What is ney and of concern ?
matters is his story of ANWHIP 12 and
dealings. THE Questions raised about AMVHIP-1 are of mutual
concern also to Headquarters which hag been running hin and
which he has visited often. (On the occasion of
previous trip on the QUUOPS-1 case
his doabts abowE tie Whole groep and speci:

voiced
IPL

and his connection with UNSNATU-19.) At i two basic
poiats, the knowledge on the part of UNSiA oat KUBARK's
connection with AMWHIP-1 and the charge that iP-1-has been

defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction.
in mind is the fact that ODENYY has aa office
well ight have been informed of the alles
have been asked for comments - although CDENYY polic,
has been to stay away from aay investigation of o
agencies unless specifically directed by the
to investigate.

iticism of the
the by the ANLASH group is not new.
and -3 were and wanted direct contact, but
Station has had reservations about seeing them. The Siation has
been involved indirectly because of regorting by its sources
about and involvement of Station targets with both tho AMLASH
nnd AMWORLD operations (both handled from cadquaxters).
(Seal___}2982 (IN 72256) ana }2993 (iN 73094) (both RYBAT).).
Meetings among QUSPORT, QUSWIYE“I, ANWHIP-1 and AMLASH Zigures
conflicting reports which previously were discussed at
and at Headquarters. Insofar as GROYERY himsely is
concerned, it must be kept in mind that he is 9 natural target
on whom the AMLASH group would be inclined to focus ifac-
plaints. With regard to the specific complaint about
GROWERY has identified her as QUS¥IFT-7. and has reported that
no staffer from the Station ever had contact with her.

4. Furthar lavolvement of ESPINOSA: On 10 June ODENVY
notified KUBARE at New York that AULASH-2 had telephoned
ESPINOSA to ask whether he had succeeded in contacting "the
proper people” ~ i.e., responsible KUBARK representatives - and
to request notice of the resulting arrangements.

5. AMVHIP-1: Our plan calls for meeting him next week

to obtain PRQ information ana to obtain clarification of the-
roles played by those involved with him in the AMLASH operation.
Hig dealings vith UNSNAYU-19 algo vill be covered. Following
this, an LCFLUTTER examination ia planned. This may help.to.-
determine whether he has been truthful in his reporting,
