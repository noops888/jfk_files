1. On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture

visited the Warrenton Record's Center to review old Mexico

City files in search of additional photographs of the

"unidentified man"

We were unable to locate any such

photographs.

It appears that earlier photographs may have

been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and

that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to

forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters

for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed

SECRET / SENSITUE

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. unilateral coverage: REPRODUCTION PROHBITED

From the time the Mexico Station was opened (in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance. team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by an employee of the local

telephone company who was handled by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped was limited only by the avallability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

American

recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on

the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

•LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages.. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites

three times a week. The film was. then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early (1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

REPRODUCTION PROMIBITED

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral mail intercept operation,

LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American case officer. A recruited

Mexican agent, who had a semiofficial status, obtained selected letters

from a subagent employed by the Mexican postal system.

2. Liaison Coverage:

Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wist restralt, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control.

In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

CC00160

maritate

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected

at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers.

In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer

assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

REPRODUCTION PROHIBITEI

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage. The Station inmediately

disconnected

all of the unilateral telephone taps on these Embassies so

that they would not be discovered when the Mexicans hooked up their

taps. The Mexicans soon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

r a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week

but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the

technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.

Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of

film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera

at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

photograph all Soviets, their fanilies, all foreigners, and cars with

foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the

photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in

either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.

About nid 1962 (check date) LINVOY (outside Mexi rept asked)

for the telephone nunders of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Enbassies.

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (untlateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Yugoslav line.

The baserouse listening post had a live

there was usually a time lag of a de

station in the same way, however,

Those transcripts which had

Russian or another languege

post the day after the tr

spanish or English went out of the listening

nipt (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Embassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the statión

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. (Ferbert Manell and his wife Barbara.

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN 1t the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here:

SOVIET:

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian; but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

and even then, they could not issue the, vasa here (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet

lingly

this man

(the American),

showed him a lettes

which he (the

American) is a member of an organi

and said that the Cubans could

ive him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the

doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has

DURAN:

..with them also, becau

problem with him (the Anerican)

is that he doesn't know

is very difficult

thinking of proces

his visa, because he knew it was

going to take

time waiting for the Russian visa in

SOVIET:

she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place,

permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can

receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN:

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a lette:

ecause they do not know if the visa will be approved

SOVIET:

DURAN:

They can only give the visa according to instructions

Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET:

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.. The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the •

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they aed to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger mani

They got the phone number fo

Isulate and the address.

After

making a call to the Con

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Irmigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her. name and

someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.
