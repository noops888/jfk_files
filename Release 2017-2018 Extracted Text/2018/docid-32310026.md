Re New York airtel to Director dated 11/7/63. V

PCI BEN SWIFT advised this date that he was

talking on phone to CHRIS MC GUIRE on evening of 11/18/63.

He stated the MC GUIRE sisters are currently playing at

Blimstroms (PH) in Boston and CHRIS expects to return to

Ft. Lauderdale at the end of this week.

She told SWIFT

that GIANCANA has not shown up at Boston to date. SWIFT

advised that PHYLLIS is apparently heeding her sister's

ultimatum that if she sees GIANCANA again the act will

bust up for good.
