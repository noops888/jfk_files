deputy Directo secur Subject andum

In accordance with referent, the undersigned

met with Subject at his home on 8 March 1977.

Subject advised that on or about 1 March 1977,

he received

a telephone call at his home from a Mr. Douglas

Day, an author, who gave his phone number as (804) 823-5436.

Although Subject has never met Mr. Day, he recalls reading

a recent review of one of his books in

Time or Newsweek.

It was a

fictional work on Spain.

Mr. Day informed Subject

that he is now working on a non-fictional book on

Che Guevara.

In developing background for this book, day

will be traveling through Latin America including Cuba.

Knowing

of Subject's

association with the Agency, he asked

for Subject's advice on how to "smooth the way"

for making

contacts at the U.S. Embassies in these countries and how

to make contact with CIA officials. Day stated that he

would be more than willing to "cooperate or work with" the

Agency during his trip.

comments to the Church Committee and especially about

"Track II", a very tightly held project in Latin America

Division.

On 22 December 1976, Hersh again called subject.

Juring this conversation, Hersh quoted some passages trom

a letter he had received

from "one of your old buddies".

He quickly read several passages making references to o?

Ted Shackley,

Jim Flannery, Kenny Million, Dino Pionzio,

Larry Sulc and Tony Sforza.

-According to Subject, the

latter two officers are really not too well-known and it

was surprising to him to hear Hersh talking about them.

Two quotes which Subject particularly recalled were,

"When Phillips called into the Office after you talked to

him, the word went straight to the top enchilada",

be trusted, even if we have to dump him.

Of course, he will not be able to do the good that

Phillips has done'"

Subject

speculated that the only persons in the

Agency who would have the type of information contained in

paragraph 3 above and who may have reason to relate it

to Hersh

are Peter Kapusta and Jack INU, who was Chief of

the Mexico

Branch

at Headquarters in 1970.
