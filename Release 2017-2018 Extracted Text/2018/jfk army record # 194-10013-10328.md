2(U(S) OPBRATIONAI DISCUSSIONS:

a, The G/O listened to the source's conversation during lunch and

obtained the news that J-315/12 was no langer in pricon in the 2 offices,

but had bear transferred to & large holding camp at la Cabana Prison as

part of a group of several hundred other profeasional men such as doctors,

Lawyers, etc. Fe bad bean assigned daties at the diepensary in bla capa

city as a surgeon and doctos, and he see in good health and was allowad

violtors once a mik. His wife, J-315/73, hed been transferred also to a

Homan's rehabilitation senter at an unlown location on the autoldrts of

Havans. She has also raceived good treatnent, performs no duties, and is

gaining weight. She lost while being questioned by the G-2. Both are

being well treated, have been given permiacion to urite to relatives in

the U.S., and have already done ao.

b. J-375 said that he and his wife were very relieved it the abore

turn of events. Both believe that this indicates that their appeals through

doing he was acoused of by the GOt on hin, J-315. J-315 belteves that

prisoners. He feels that by permitting the present situation to contime

a few nanths, thus allowing a "cooling off period", the altuation may

becone favorable for further appeals of a huanitarian nature, requesting

the prisoners' pardon and possible exit fram Guba. The C/O, of course,

agreed that the change of prison, assigment to duty and permission to

write, certainly indicated that the God was not considering violent action,

and expressed his own and the organization's gratification at this good

news. J-315 stated that when he felt the cooling off period had passed

he had some more "aces" to play, and naked the 0/0's opinion..

is

do J-315 stated that a friend of bis, one Miguel FIGUROA, presently

a professor at the University of Fuerto Rieo, and also the Cuban First

Secretary in Rone during the bagining of Horld War II. At that time Cube

and Italy severed relations, An a resalt, FIGUEROA was interned 1a, or

given refuge 1n Vatican City during the ver years, FIGUETOA bacame a

persozal friend of the present Pape, to the extent that the Pope became

God Father to one of the FIGUEROA abildren born in Italy. The two have

ranzined friende throughout the jears. 1-315 plans to ask one Juan Antonio

RUBTO Padilla, a Friend at J-315 and relative of J- 315/13, to vieit the

Pope the sunner of 1969 and convey FIQUIRDA's personal request that the

aral

Pope contact the GOd and personally intercede for a possible pardon ia

exile of the prisoners. RUBIO is one of the prominent leaders of Cetholocist

onl

in the world today and intimate friend of USe FNU Fernandez, the Arch Bishop

of Cordoba in Spain. J-315 believes such an appeal has an extollent chance

of success. The G/0 agreed that this was, a worthy effort and expressed

his wiah that It succaed.

so J-315 said he believed that the doc did not have mch proof of

any serious crime against the prisoners or they would have executed them.

The fact that t-315/12's elster, Ghicha, and her husband had been pieted

up and imprisoned in mid-lovenber for questioning indicated that the Goc

inestigation of 1-315/12%s activitien had not produced too much. They

apprahended Chocha probably sinss she was his secretary at his citric.

The 6/0 agread that

tringe were progresting botter than hoped and that

the future seamed negle it tials time the 6/0 brought tip the rabet

of the need for ternination of operations, and It dovetailed beautitully,

for J-315 had just said that he tas glad that he had not been Involved in

J-315/23's ovart political nachinations for the last four to flue montas.

The G/0 told the subject that he had bam direcied to teminate the opera-

tions involving J-315 and the entire operation in order to safeguard the

lives of the prisoners. Any continuance of intelligence operations

against the 00c would jeopardize their livas 1f detected. However, the

C/0 desirad thet even though operations were terminated that 2-315 monitor

the status of the prisonars and keep the C/O's organisation infomed. In

order to do this, the C/D was providing I-315 with a P. D. Boz in the

Wastington, D.Go, aras so that he could rail periodical infornation con-

cerning the prisoners. The 6/0 stated that he was also providing 1-315

with an allowance: for alt months" expenses so that J-315 would not bear the

cest of monitoring the status of the prisonara alone. The 6/0 said that he

had racoamended the sin of $125,00 per wonth which had been approved by

bis superiors, Additionally, he had recommended that J-325 be given tu

I. J-315 did not react in an adverse naner to the notice of termina-

tion. He agreed that vasaution of operatione was vory wise and that he

would keep the organisation informad by mail. He did, though, earnestly

ask that although ho was aware that operations were ended, that contact.

or in Washington, or elsewhere, there be could contact the organization

in the case of en energency or when he had information on the prisoners

that neaded to be delivered in a barry. The C/O stated that he would

relay his request to his superiors and advise him via telephone to a

pay telephone booth as had been done during the past three months. J-315

wishad the G/O sell in his new assignment and hoped that they see each

other some dey agals. He hoped that 1f he vre ever iwolved in other

work for the organization that he be placed in contact with a nature indivi

dual whom he could telk to with cunfidonce that he was dealing with an

So I-315 earnestly asked that the organization consider assisting

hán to obtain a pernit to carry a raspon in Florida. He stated he had

obtainad a permit in Faerto Rico, but that he bad no contacte in Miami

to antist him as he had in Puerto Rico. He was atraid that he might be

the object of an attempt by the GeC to assassinate him for bis involve-

ment with J315/12. As cited the attenot on ex-Gastro GAPT Oton PALAU

who was shot 6 ar ? tinas on 16 Hovember, and 1s in critical condition 1n

Mari, I-315 balieves that he is probably on thelr list for assassination

and is ready to defand himself if nosessary. He expressed desp concern

of his being aboard one of the hi-jacked planen because of his weekly

round-trip between Mani and Sen Jueri, Puerto Rico, He added that if an

attempt is ever made to bi-jack a plane he 1a eboard, he sould resist the

hi-jachers, for he fears 1f be lands 1n Havana, he will be sumarily shot.

He does not plas to carry a pistol aboard the planss, for he is anare that

he may be subject to search at any time. At present he fakas being lame

and carries a tane aboard, wishfully hoping that he could use that to over

power any possible hi-jacker. The C/0 replier that he would check this

aras, The C/O is researching Illth's reaction to the establishment of

Mr. Rodriguez as a contact for subject for energency use and will include

that result as pert of his termination raport and summary of the imprison

nent and status of the prisoners. C/O believes that we should monitor

their status in the future and make every effort to insure that J-315 and

his family or J-315/23 take no eteps to ambarrass the U.S, by any accusa-

tione and/or publicity. In arder to do this it ney bedone necessery in

the future to have soneone contact J-315 or his wife in order to permit

them to express their soncern, fears or sorrow. This will act as a safety

valve and will enable t.s, to have advance notice of any proposed acts on

their part which may be injurious to the U.s.A.
