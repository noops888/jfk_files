MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 3 Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1. Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of
$4,000 is requested for the period 1 July 1969 through
30 June 1970. The Project was budgeted for $4,000 for
FY 1970 and funds are available within WH Division.

2, LIHUFF represents Mexico City Station's access
into right wing political elements and organizations in
Mexico, and provides contact with the large and influ-
ential American business community there. In addition,
his access to Dun and Bradstreet reports has also been
useful in carrying out checks on WOLADY citizens of
operational intcrest to the Station. During the project
year three field information reports were credited to
the Project, one of which was disseminated by Head-
quarters, and some thirty-five background investigations
and file traces were conducted by the agent.

3. In paragraph D "Effectiveness" of the attached,
renewal request it was noted, "He (LIHUFF-1) also organ-
ized at the request of COS (who, in turn, had been
requested by Headquarters) a public demonstration in
front of the Soviet Embassy in protest against the in-
vasion of Czechoslovakia." A review of the LITEMPO
Project reveals that LITEMPO-4 was paid $4,000.00 by the
Station to organize and rally as many students as possible
in addition to the MURO planned demonstration in front of
the Soviet Embassy, and to Headquarter's knowledge LIHUFF-1
did not organize the student demonstration on behalf of the

Station.

4, The Desk feels that this Project should be reviewed
during the upcoming project year to determine whether it
should be continued.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/WH
SUBJECT : Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1. Project LIHUFF covers a singleton agent (a U.S.
citizen) who has been managed directly by the COS, Mexico
City, and who has worked for WHD for more than twenty years,
beginning in Panama and continuing in Mexico. LIHUFF-1 pro-
vides the Station access to right-wing political elements and
contact with the American business community in Mexico City
(he is executive director of the American businessman's
association).

2. The project provided three disseminations in Fiscal
Year 1969, and it is deemed unlikely that it will ever be a
source of éffective and meaningful intelligence.

3. WH/FI suggests that LIHUFF-1 be considered for one or

7 several specific support tasks, which represent a continuing
burden for Station Mexico City, and that he no longer be con-
sidered as a source of intelligence.

4. If it is ascertained that he can perforn/support
task(s), we advise that the project be terminated. In the
meantime, we recommend approval in the amount of $4,000 for

Fiscal Year 1970.

note: I believe that
we should take a hard look at this ‘AC7WH7¥T
one.)

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL
PROJECT LIHUFF

A. CURREN TIVES

The objective of this project is to provide support for
a singleton contract agent, LIHUFF-1, who is the Executive
Director of the most important organization of WOLADY
businessmen in Mexico, He also continues to have access to
right-wing political elements and organizations in Mexico,
one of which is a right-wing student group (principally at
the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, UNAM).

B. CHANGES

1, Operational Mechanism

There have been no changes in this respect since the
previous project renewal was submitted.

2. Agents

The only agent to be supported by this project for the
coming year is LIHUFF-1.

C. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

1. Three disseminated reports were credited to this project
during FY 1969:

» HMM-11890 "University Rector's Conviction that U. S.
Promoted Student Riots."

HMM-12003 "Views of Minister of Industry and Commerce
on Forthcoming Visit of Nelson Rockefeller.”

HMM-12008 "Views of Minister of Industry and Commerce
on Government Control of Radio and Television."

maa iis

Sst,

scecutbstoadapoms



-2-

2. This agent is used as a source for background, opera-~
tional and investigative data. For that reason it does not
produce a sufficient amount of positive intelligence to justify
its existence for that purpose. Its real value is the
availability of this agent and his contacts to the Chief of
Station, Mexico, for a current reading on right-wing political
activities and personalities. He is also a primary investiga-
tive source for information on WOLADY citizens of operational
interest to the Station. This agent has access to all reports
produced by Dunn & Bradstreet in Mexico and can have investiga-
tions conducted by them.

DO. EFFECTIVENESS

During the project year, the agent provided the Station
with details on a proposed new federal levor law (which was
subsequently passed) and an analysis on how this new law would
affect foreign investors or companies. The agent also kept “the
Chief of Station, Mexico, advised of right-wing political
activities and student agitation. He also organized at the
request of COS (who, in turn, had been requested by Headquarters)
a@ public demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy in protest
against the invasion of Czechoslovakia. LIHUFF-1 conducted
about thirty-five background investigations and file traces for
the Station.

E. PROBLEMS

This project has presented the Station with no problems of
security or cover.

F. LIAISON

This project involves no liaison relationship.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1, Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of $4,000
‘is requested for the period 1 July 1968 through 30 June
1969. The project was budgeted for $4,200 for FY 1969 and
funds are available within WH Division.

2, During the past year, one progress report was
received, in June 1968, recapitulating the activities
reported in the attached renewal request. Although the
Station has made use of LIHUFF's relations with the right
wing student organization, MURO, in connection with
Evgeniy YEVTUSHENKO's visit to Mexico this spring, the
use of MURO is being de-emphasized. The main value of
LIHUFF/1, a long time collaborator previously serving in
Panama and beginning in OSS days, is his availability to
service various requests which the COS may make of him
and to provide insight into the activities of the extreme
right wing of Mexican politics. His access to Dun and
Bradstreet reports has also been useful.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

This agent is used as a source for background, operational and

cient amount of positive intelligence to justify its existence j
for that purpose, It's real value is the availability of this
agent and his contacts to the Chief of Station, Mexico, for a
current reading on right-wing political activities and personalities.

He is also a primary investigative source for information on WOLADY ©

citizens of operational interest to the Station. This agent has
access to‘all reports produced by Dunn & Bradstreet in Mexico and .
can have investigations conducted by them. For example, some forty:
Dunn & Bradstreet reports have been obtained (via LIHUFF/1) on
persons and/or organizations of interest.

EFFECTIVENESS

During the project year, the agent provided the Station with

details of Mexican Government plans to impose legislative
restrictions on foreign investments and Government advice to banks ;
to limit loans to companies with an appreciable amount of foreign
capital.

This agent kept the Chief of Station, Mexico, advised of right-
wing political activities and student participation in anti-
LNHARP demonstrations which occurred at least once each month
during the past year,

LIHUFF-1 conducted some twenty background investigations and file
traces for the Station, in addition to those cited in C above.

In March LINLUCK prevailed upon a Mexican book publisher to print
copies of the LINLUCK open letter to Yevtushenko as well as the
text of the telegram by Soviet intellectuals to the Consultative
Conference of Communist Parties in Budapest asking for an end to
Soviet persecution of intellectuals. The latter handbill was
illustrated with LINWWCK pen and ink drawings of Sinyavsky and
Daniel behind barbed wire. At the same time the Station produced
several thousand cartoon and text handbills of a beatnik Yevtu-
shenko dancing into Mexico tossing ftowers. Turning a fold of the -
handbill revealed a Russian officer striking off the nib of a }
Soviet writer's pen with his sword. In a wet run in January LITEAR=
1 directed four small boys in the distribution of the cartcon band~#
bill in the artists’ district of Mexico where Station monitors t
watched students and artists read and pocket the cartoon handbill. : u
The cartoon handbill was again distributed in the artists' district’

on the day of Yevtushenko's arrival. The following day, when

Yevtushenko held his first recital at Mexico City's Chapultepec
Park, one of the handbills was distributed by LICOAX students,
while members of the "MURO" rightist student organization under
direction of LIHUFF quietly distributed the other two handbills. ik
Station officers verified that everyone in the audience held copies?
of the black WOFIRM material.

INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION

This project involves no inter-agency coordination,
PLANS

Station Mexico plans to continue to use LIHUFF~1 as a support
agent and informant on activities of right-wing political mino-
rity groups and for investigative and background information on
persons of operational interest.

FUNDS

1, The cost of the LIHUFF Project (paid by the Mexico Station
exclusive of Headquarters costs) from 1 July 1967 through
31 May 1968 was approximately US $200.00 which does not
include the agent's salary of US $3,300 ($300 per month) -

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : Request for Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1, It is requested that Project LIHUFF be renewed
in the amount of $4,200.0u for the period 1 July 1967
through 30 June 1968. Funds are available in WH Division.
Project costs are estimated to be the same as last year.

woman

2. LIHUFF represents Mexico City Station's access
into right wing circles, and also provides contact and ‘ iz
rapport with the large and influential American business i
community there. It will be observed from the attached t
renewal request that a considerable portion of the i
project's accomplishment was along political action
lines, but it has nevertheless been decided to maintain H
LIHUFF as an FI activity, since the addition of the
investigative function to LIHUFF-1's mission balances
the project more heavily on the FI side, There has been
no progress reporting since 16 November 1966, at which
time the station recounted the harrassing of a Czech
official, the Soviet Embassy and the Chinese art exhibit.
Since the principal agent is personally handled by a E
busy chief of station,however, and since the course of
the operation changes little from month to month, the
infrequent reporting is explainable. i

political groups, nevertheless, the Aubassador devends upon Station
Mexico for information on all political groups. LIHUP?-1 is the only
Station asset who circulates freely in these circles, During the

past year, LIHUFF-1 has conducted through bis organization, investigations
and checks on firms and individuals connected with then. ‘This type of
operational deta is not available from any other sources. LIHUFF-1 has
access to all reports produced by Dury & Bradstreet in Mexico; and can
have investigations initiated by then and cthers.

EFFSCTIVENSSS
Some examples of the effectiveness of tnis project are: “

1) During the past year, LIHUFP-1 provided guidance to a right-wing
action group which launched a press attack against the Comercial
officer of the Czech Bubassy (Subject of 201-204656) which resulted
in his PCS transfer from Mexico.

2) In late Augus: 1966 LIHUFF-1 arranged for a right-wing action
Group to conduct 2 harrassment of a Chinese Comrunist Art Exhibit at
the UNAM which resulted in the closing of the exhibit. This action
was taken as a result of a personal request of the Chief LNPURE,
Results were reported to Headquarters.

3) In October 1966 LIHUFF-1 arranged for a student action group to
conduct a demonstration in front of the Soviet Snbassy on the 10th
enniversary of the crushing of the Hungarian rebellion. This resulted
in considerable press comment against the Soviets with photographic
coverage of a casket and anti-Soviet banners on the sidewalk in front
of the Soviet Bmbassy.

REQUEST FOR REEWAL
PROJECT LIHUFF

CURRED OBJECTIVES

The objective of this project is to provide for the operational

and administrative support for a high-level contract egent, LIHU?F1,
vho has access and is a participant in the right-wing political
elements and orgentzations in Mexico; and through one of these con-
tacts, has access to a right-wing student (principally at the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico = tus).

CHANGES -
1) Operational Nechaniem

The LIWUFF Project was approved in September 1965 for the period

1 July 1965 through 30 June 1966, LIHUFF/1, the eingleton agent
involved, has been e contact of the Mexico Station since 1950,

Before that time he vas a contract agent for Station Panama when he
was in business in that area. In November 1962 the relationship was
formalized into contract status with LIEUFP/1 acting es a funding
channel to an anti-Comunist research group and rightest student group
headed by LINUFF/2, a3 well es handling LICHANT/) ani reporting on
right-wing activities from other conservative business sources, This
activity was funded fron Station OOA until 1 July 1965, The LOUFF
Project provided only for salary and operational expenses for LUIUFF/1.

2) Agents

The only agent to be supported by this project for the coming year

is LIHUFF/1, No further subsidies are planned to LIRUF?/2, LICHANE/1
vas relieved of his position and is not
ineluded as a part of the LIHUFF Project. However, 7/1 continues
in his private business capacity to solicit funds for the LIRUFF/2 group
and will continue to use thea as sources for information on right-wing
political activities.

” SNTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

The Mexico Station makes no effort to justify this project on the basis
of positive intelligence disseminations. The information is primarily
for background, It is often too sketchy for formal dissemination ani is

seep oe



frequently overtaken by public events before a dissemination c:n be
made. LIHUFF/1 meets regulerly with and is handled directly by
Willard C, Curtis, Chief of Station Mexico, Th

obtein information in response to

In addition to

[depends upon Station Mexico for information

on all political groups. LIHUFF/1 represents the only high-level
source trained and available who can circulate freely in Mexican
concervative political circles and provide the Mexico Station with
information on their activities, During the past project year
LIHUFF/1 has provided the Station with the following general
categories of information:

1) Memoranda on leftists or Commnist affiliation of members of
the Mexican intellectual and official community, This is
generally based on contribution of funds or public assistance
in behalf of known leftist or Communist organizations, hence
the information is use‘ul for background rather than disseaination.

2) Information on Catholic Church activities in Mexico, including
press clippings and periodic reports on the rightest student
action group, Movimfento Universitario Renovedora Orientacion
fpamo} active at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
(UNAM), the Universities of Puebla, Guadajalara and Michoacan.
WM-10,325, the only positive intelligence dissemination received
from LIHUFP during the past project year was obtained from the
MURO group et UNAM, In August 1965, Chief, PBSWING asked for
a complete report on "Los Tecos", a right-wing Catholic secret
society of vhich MURO is a student era, This information wes
required by Chief, PESWINS, to nake a decision on the application
of the Universidad Autonosa de Guadalajera (U.A.G.) for certain
U.S. Government-sponsored monetary grants of several hundred
thousand dollers to be used for development of this anti-
Communist University which is competitive with the Communist
dominated University of Gusdalejare. From background data
previously supplied by LIEUFF and other sources, a detailed
report was made available to Cilef, PBSWING.

3) anti-Communist publications from LIEUFF/2's right-wing
research center end MURO student publications, all of which
are available to Headquarters and are of interest to the Station
for background.

political activities. Also, as previously reported to Headquarters,
the groups influenced by LIWFF,1 represent a potential for counter
balancing for leftist and Commnist pressure groups. One example oe
of this can be cited in action taken by student MURO leaders in August ne
1965. ‘The Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquin HERNANDZZ Armas, set ;
about making speeches at Mexican (leftist) Universities*of-Tabasco,

Michoacan and Gundalajara proposing Maxicnn-Cuban student exchanges.

MORO mecbers tamediately set up a storm of public protest, dexanding

that HERNANDEZ Armas be declared persona non-grata for spreading i
subversive propaganda and agitating on university campuses. This
caused HERNANDEZ Armas to be a target for considerable unpleasant ql
press publicity. Through LIHUFF/1, the Station Mexico can exploit '
such incidents vhen it is to KUBARK's advantage to do so,

PROBLEMS

There have been no significant security, cover or control problems
with LIHUFF/1 during the project year.

2. During the next project year.

During the period 1 July 1966 through 30 June 1967, an
estizated US$ 4,200.00 is requested. It will be used in the
following manner?

LIQUF?/1 Salary $5,600.00
Operational expenses 600,00

The above represents whet Chief of Station Mexico believes is
the minimum that will be required to keep a working-level
relationship with this very useful agent.

J. ANNEX

None.

K. EMERGDICY CONDITICIS

If an official enti-USA atmosphere of sufficient intensity prevailed
in Mexico, it is unlikely that LIAUFF/1 could remain in the country
in his present business. In a general emergency, LIMUFF/1 vould

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 2 Renewal of Project LIHUFF

“1. Renewal is requested of the LIHUFF Project for the
period 1 July 1965 through 30 June 1966 for a total of
$9,000. The LIHUFF Project was originally approved on 20
April 1965 for $7,500 for the period 1 January 1965 to
30 June 1965 as a CA Project. It has been decided that
the direction of the agent under this project and the
project objectives in general will be changed from CA to
FI, and therefore, the renewal request is being submitted
as an FI Project. The Operational Program for FY 1966
included LIHUFF for $16,000. Funds are available in WH
Division.

2. The Project objectives under CA were to support
and sustain MURO, a national right-wing student movement,
through a long-established anti-communist front organiza-
tion in Mexico, the Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales
y Economicas (IISE). This support was terminated effective
30 June 1965 as it became apparent that the IISE was
financially capable of providing this support on its own
and MURO became more and more controversial and extremely
militant on the far right. Under the new project sub-
mitted by the Station, support will be provided to a U.S.
contract agent who has access to a wide variety of right-
wing political elements and organizations in Mexico. The

3. This project is the only project in the Mexico
Station which will cover rightist political activity in
Mexico, emphasis in other projects and operations being
geared against the extreme left and the present political
party, the PRI, which is slightly left of,
than LICHANT-1, the only other access to

is LIBELER who is carried under his own project.

SEGiti

Set ae lt



4. Headquarters and the Station are looking forward
to receiving better coverage on the rightist political
activity in Mexico. WH/1 is preparing guidelines and
requirements for this project which will reflect the needs
of the intelligence community. These requirements will be
furnished the field so that proper utilization can be made
of LIHUFF-1 and his contacts and informants. During the
last fiscal year, three reports were credited in full or
in part to LIHUFF-1.

5, Last year the Station submitted regular quarterly
progress reporting in addition to more detailed reporting
on certain activities. The Station will be reminded to
provide a minimum of quarterly reporting during the next
year.

6. WH/1 recommends approval of the new LIHUFF Project
as it is set forth in the attached Station renewal request.
The delay in submission of the renewal request is that it
was just decided to change this Project to FI and cancel
out most of the CA aspects. As a CA Project the renewal
request was not due at Headquarters until mid-July 1965.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/WHD
SUBJECT 3 LIHUFY Renewal

1. Project LIHUFF has been active as a CA project for
a number of years. It is now being renewed and submitted as
ap FI project. Its purpose and objective is to support a
singleton U.S, contract agent (LIHUFF~1) who has access to a
wide variety of right wing political elements and organiza~
tions in Mexico in order to develop information on this
iitical and social sector, This effort is
the only one whic!

covers rightist political activity in Wexico.

2. Sinee LIHUFP was previously a CA project, there is,
therefore, no data on which to judge past intelligence oreduct
although three reports resulted im the past year. The iiexican
Desk and the Station are taking stepe to prepare suitable
requirenents in keeping with LIHUY?+1's access and the objectiv
ef the project.

3. The reporting received from the Station with regurd te, ‘

the operational status of the agent and project appears to.
have been adequate in the past. There are no apparent security |
or control problens.

4, $9,000 has been requested in support of the project
effective 1 July 1965, Of this smount $5,400 is marked for
operational expenses, entertainment, and travel. A study
of the detailed project outline leads to the conclusion that
this latter figure is somewhat excessive when viewed against
anticipated operational activity and in all likelihood only
Very little of it will be expended.

5. Progect LIHUFF is recommended for approval.

SUBJECT 3 Approval of Project LIEUFF

1. WH/L requests approval of Project LIHUFF in the acount of

2, ‘his rev project 1s to provide some support and help sus-
tain an independent Mexican anti-communist group called the Instituto
de Investigaciones Sociales y Economicas. The group founded in 1953
has as its aim the spreading of the principles of free enterprise ond
private initiative. LIHUFF is particularly active in the student field,
having orgenized a nation-wide, right-wing, active student organization
celled Movimiento Universitario de Renovadora Orientacion (MUR0),
LIHUFF funds will be used to pay a salary to LIMUFF-1, en American
businessmaa with previous experience with CIA in Panama, and for spot
covert action activities such as the militant anti-communist student
activities in the universities and the placement of articles in the
press.

3. Effectiveness ua

During the developmental period of this activity, the
following indications of effectiveness have been reported:

A. Former Ambassador Thomas Mann valued the IISE publica-
tion "Espejo" as worth far more than what one man in the field
could accomplish. (Station funds no longer support “Espejo.")

EB. The IISE continues to provide the Station wih e research
facility not otherwise available.

C. Provided the Station with a valuable intellectual asset,
Manuel Calvillo Alonso, who is a source of FI on right-wing political
groups and who completed a book at Station request on the "Penetra-
tion of the Mexican Zducstional System by Cocmunists."

D. MURO's 200 shock troops have campaigned vigorously
against Cormunism and pro-Castro groups at the National University
(UNAM), and in the Universities of Puebla and Guadalajara. MURO
takes najor credit for the ouster in past months of Comunist rectors
from the Universities of Monterrey, Puebla, Guadalajare, and Morelia;
MURO contihues to place anti-communist articles in the national nedia
df interest ‘to students and governzent leaders;-MURO has carried out
successful demonstrations against tae Soviet Brbassy.

B, MURO took an active part in cabling the Chilean govern-
ment protesting the Communist nature of the Latin American Youth
Conference in Santiago.

F, LIHUFF-2 is used by the Station for writing and placing
certain typee of strong anti-Soviet articles in Bxcelsior and BL
Universal.

G. LIBUFF-2 acquired evidence of a large purchare of
American hospital supplies by two professors at UNAM for tranship-
nent to Cuba.

4, Security

The IISB is funded througa a cut-out in suck a way that CIA
participation is concealed. Only LLNFF-1, vho 1s met clandestinely
by @ Station case officer, is witting of the true source of fusis.
There have been no security problens during the developuental period

of this activity.

5. Reporting on this proposed project has been adequate. Five
progress reports vere received during the past year.

it is the present intention to turn over the operation to either
Oliver N. PRIMACK or Stewart K. PATAKER as the case officer. However,
for obvious reasons, it is not desired to naxe the introduction of one of

these individuals to LIHUFF/! until such tice as an assurance of continuity

vith Headquarters’ approval of the activity as a formal project has bem

received,

2. In view of the time which has elasped since the exchanges indicated

in referenced dispatches have taken place, the Station would appreciate an
indication from Headquarters whether or not LIHUFF is being processed asa
project. If it is not or approval has been denied for one reason or

another, the Station would also appreciate knowing this so whatever action

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Comments on Proposed Project LIHUFF

1. I recomend this project proposal not be subsitted
for approval, for the following reasons:

We wet &. Tho LIHUFP organization has other sources of
- Cc funds and would conduct its retivities anyway without any
S 4~-" _eupport or aid from CIA or any other U. S. Goveranent agency.
. £4 23° TURK project to fund the organization is unnecessary.

b. The Station indicates that it has achieved,
Amy 8nd can continue to achievo, results through the LIHUFF
‘vont mochanisn without making sizeable payments. A project to
a provide a subsidy is therefore winecessary.

ce. Several senbers of the LIHUFF organization ere

also members of the LISIREN organization. One of them,

Wwe Eduardo PRIETO Lopez, recently discussed the LISIREN oper-

eat

ation with the DCI in the latter's Headquarters office and
is _neare of U. S. Government funding to the LISIREN complex.
This fact, taken with the similarity of the proposed funding

foment to that of LISIREN, the similarity of operations

of tho two organizations, and other such parallels could ts
eventually be expected to_etrip LINUFF of its cover and
create a potential security probles.

d. The activities that this proposed project vould
subsidize overlap the activities of several other operations
in the Station. LIHUFF does not contribute enough beyond
this overlapping to be justified. Its student program coin-
cides with Projects HIEVICT, LILISP-c and, to a lesser extent,
LICOAX, Its press placement and publications program dup-
licates much of that coutemplated or conducted in

LLiIOGDLE, and LILISP-E. (« ae eed ary) :

e. The past accomplishments of the operation cited
in the project outline, Appendix II, are minimal at best
and hardly sufficient to recommend the project. Briefly,
these accomplishments were:

Should you wish to support other specific projects through LIHUFF
such as the publication of the book, these will be considered by

Headquarters on a case to case basis.

3. The above authorized expenditures are to be charged to
D&TO and under no circumstances are they to exceed the amounts
specified. In this connection, you are advised that Headquarters has
allocated an additional $30,000 to the Station's D&TO funds for the
fiscal year 1964 bringing the total for FY64 to $82,500. It is not
likely that any further increase can be obtained.

4. The Station is also requested to submit to Headquarters,
not later than 1 June 1964, an up-dated assessment of the LIHUFF
operation. If at that time the Station wishes to present a revised

project for fiscal year 1965, your recommendations should be fully
submitted in the reassessment. If your recommendations are accepted,
then Headquarters will undertake to rewrite the project outline
