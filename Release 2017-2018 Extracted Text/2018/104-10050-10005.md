Sudject: Background on iexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. From the time the viexico Station vas opened in |

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Soa

exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of milti line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone company
notena ol Me Prat ad.
who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines

tapped ves linked by availability of a Listening, eet nearby

‘teandcribers. Generally
these agents ( (costars “or Mexican American) were related
(hich th Ria at time felt vas good security in thet
if they ea about’ shop,” they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites vere handled by Anderson with the kelp y
of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) end TDY TSD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA), LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had !
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

NorthWest corner.of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally \

across a double ee street on the Southses: q

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the same side of the street
as LEAITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slantéd view of

the front gate of the Soviet Znbassy, The agents in LIMGTED and LILYRIC (both

Mexican farilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with cach other.

to accumilate, the inside CO (ishoney) became disgusted and took the filn out

for Ranon's brother-in-law to process (probaly early 1959). Thus Raxon becane — |

2. Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by the nature

of the Mexican services at thet tines. The Mexican DFS (Direction of Federal

Levine De Leon (later LIFIRE group) in about 1950 or 51. He gave then some
training (a group of about five surveillance types) in trevel control vorking

3. My memory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Enbassy but I
think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New
Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a sakeshift arrangement of volunteers
through most of 1960 and 61 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluainous reports on
their activities and recruitirg agents right and left enong Cuban netionals in
Mexico City.

Warren Commission. To deter-tine wro vas there and what they vere doing I

About mid 1962 (check date) LIFIVOY outside Nexi rept asked
for the telephone nunvers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Exbassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. Kowever,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cubon lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, “and 1 Yugoslev line. The basekouse listening post had a live

monitor wro mede short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily i
resume which was received each day arourd & a.n. (passed by Flick to Goodpasture
to get to Scott before 9.a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same vay, however,
there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which hdd
Russien or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening
post the day after the transcript (of other conversations .of'\ Ra reel)vas
