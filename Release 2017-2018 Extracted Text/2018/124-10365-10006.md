Statements about Himself

Biography: NOSENKO has contradicted himself in his own

accounts of his life in ways which ma, especially noteworthy is

and personalities he is reporting on.

this shift of dates. in 1962, he said that he graduated from the

Institute of Foreign Relations in 1950, went into the Naval GRU,

then entered the KGB at the beginning of 1953. In 1964, he

said he had graduated in 1949 and entered the KGB in early 1952.

This affects his version of getting into the KGB with KOBULOV's

help as KOBULOV was not in the KGB from 1948 to March 1953.

2. Friendship with GUK and CHURANOV: NOSENKO claims to be

an

intimate friend of certain KGB officers, especially GUK and

CHURANOV, from whom he has obtained by word of mouth most of the

few operational items he has been able to provide outside his own

immediate sphere of activity.

He mentions these two individuals

so often that that alone would deserve special attention. But on

top of that these two individuals were, two of GOLITSYN's closest

contacts, from whom GOLITSYN also learned by word of mouth about

many operations - sensitive ones at that - which he had no

the

same information as GOLITSYN (some of which is outlined in

Tab "D",

Table #4), which he is using -- at no cost to the KGB

as build-up for himself.

3. Personal Involvement in Key Accidents: NOSENKO, when he

came out in 1964, had certain information which he particularly

wanted to give us concerning practically all of the known of

notorious incidents of soviet security history in the period

to the limit that this one KGb officer,

NOSENKO, was personally

involved in every one of them, and could thus talk - and deliver

the KGB's "message" - with complete authority.

Note his role

in the cases of Lee Harvey OSWALD,

of Professor BARGHOORN, of

of the CHEREPANOV affair (even to the point of

showing a travel order for his use in the "search" for CHEREPANOV)

and others. Note also his fortuitous friendship with Georgiy

BOLSHAKOV, which permitted him to recount in detail a provocative

version of BOLSHAKOV's dealings with the White House.

Order of Lenin and/or Case Award: NOSENKO mentioned in

January 1964 that he had received the Order of Lenin "shortly

after the 1962 meetings with us," as a result of ideas he

developed

on how to enlarge the experience and improve the

quality of staff personnel on the job.

About a month later he

mentioned to one of his security guards that he had received a

large cash award (no date, but was then reluctant to say why; it

is not clear whether this is separate from the medal mentioned

earlier). Now, such medals and awards are not given for routine

contributions. However, it is possible that NOSENK could not

resist bragging about his medal

or feared that we might hear of

it through other sources), and that he actually got it for his

1962 meeting with waste timing Would suggest me.

on one occasion he pointedly asked whether his T962 case officer

had received an award from the 1962 meetings with him.

And the

cash award may have been related to a report from another source

that some officers of the American Department of the Second Chief

Directorate had gotten cash awards for the recruitment of one or

more Americans in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow around 1960 -- when

NOSENKO was in that Department.

Claim to have Worked in Place for Us: NOSENKO has

repeatedly said that he tried earnestly to collectevery bit of

information he could for us during the period between the 1962

Yet he clearly did not try to collect

even the most insignificant

from his

many contacts, nor did he even bring out clear

organization for the First Chief Directorate, which could be had

operational leads he so earnestly collected do not, insofar as:

Department in January 1962. According to knowledgeable sources,

a provocation agent about to be put into contact with hostile

intelligence would usually be removed from his job, particulariy

if it was a relatively sensitive one, at least six months before

being sent out.

This is the exact pattern in NOSENKO's biography:

he left (at least ostensibly) the section working against the

American Embassy just a month after GOLITSYN's defection (and

about the time planning for a provocation would have begun) and

moved to the Tourist Department, whose targets and methods are

less sensitive, more transitory - and more numerous - and whose

basic techniques had been well known to GOLITSYN, partly through

a detailed document GOLITSYN was known to have taken with him

I from the Helsinki Residency. It is possible that NOSENKO did

not in fact move from the First Department as early as he claims.

7.' Sourcing of Information:

NOSENKO has provided information

(1), from his own immediate vantage point in the Tourist Department,

and (2), which he has learned through other means. In the first

category we learned interesting details on methods and organization,

although their essence was already known from GOLITSYN; and a

mass of names and identifying data on agents and agent candidates

which he claims to be the totality of his Department's successes

and which turn out to be practically worthless to us or the KGB.

His own position,

however,

has enabled NOSENKO to play a role in

some more notorious events:

the OSWALD case, theL

Icase, thes

BARGHOORN case, etc, which are of interest.

But much of

NOSENKO's more

interesting information came from outside his

immediate periphery.

His accounts of how he got these other

items provide an interesting aspect of the bona fides problem.

As will be touched on again in this paper, NOSENKO has

what. we get

from him through questioning Aside from OSWALD,

BARGHOORN and

however, practically every one of these was

outside his normal access, and was obtained fortuitously. or

through conversations with other case officers. ThiS-way of

getting information is normal and expectable.

What is unusual

about NOSENKO's case is that his explanations are in every such

case either vague, confused or unbelievable and he quickly

becomes irritated and defensive when questioned in detail on

sources •

Almost every item that NOSENKO volunteered has an

implausible source.

A few examples are given in the paragraphs

below.
