PERSONAL DATA, CONDUCT AND MANNER

Statements about Himself

1. Biography: NQSENKO has contradicted himself in his own
accounts of his Ti in ways which be relate O° e events
d_-persorabities ‘is reporting” ecially noteworthy is

pnis shirt of -tatest it said“that he graduated from the
Instittte of Foréign Relations in 1950, went into the Naval GRU,
and then entered the KGB at the beginning of 1953. In 1964, he
said he had graduated in 1949 and entered the KGB in early 1952.

This affects his version of getting into the KGB with KOBULOV's
help as KOBULOV was not in the KGB from 1948 to March 1953.

2, Friendship with GUK and CHURANOV: NOSENKO claims to be
an intimate friend of certain KGB officers, especially GUK and
CHURANOV, from whom he has obtained by word of mouth most of the
few operational items he has been able to provide outside his own
immediate sphere of activity. He mentions these two individuals
so often that that alone would deserve special attention. - Bit on
top of that these two individuals were, two of GOLITSYN's closest
contacts, from whom GOLITSYN also learned by word of mouth about

many operations -- sensitive ones at that -~ which he had no
right know. Yet, if NOSENKO were in fact this cld8é to then,
here havi own ENKO

better, As it is, GOLITSYN remembers only that there was a.
NOSENKO working in the American Department of the Second.Chief
Directorate who had a_reputati a Skirt xr, | There are
grounds here for suSpicion that GUK and CHURANOV gave honest
accounts of what they had told GOLITSYN in the KGB damage
assessment of GOLITSYN's defection, and that NOSENKO is fabri-
cating this alleged friendship to explain how he had access to
the same information as GOLITSYN (some of which is outlined? in Rn
Tab "D", Table #4), which he is using ~- at no cost to the:KGB —
as build-up for himself. :

3. Personal Involvement in Key Accidents: NOSENKO,' when -he
came out in 1964, had certain information which he particularly
wanted to give us concerning practically all of the known ba
notorious incidents of Soviet security history in the period . |
Since his last meetings with us. It appears to stretch coincidence |}

to the limit that this one KGB officer, NOSENKO, was personally
involved in every one of them, and could thus talk -- and deliver
the KGB's "message" ~~ with complete authority. Note his role

cases of Lee Harvey OSWALD, of Professor BARGHOORN, of
(3. of the CHEREPANOV affair (even to the point of
fowing a travel order for his use in the "search" for CHEREPANOV) .

and others. Note also his fortuitous friendship with Georgiy
, BOLSHAKOV, which permitted him to recount in detail a provocative
\version of BOLSHAKOV's dealings with the White House.

4. Order of Lenin and/or casd Award: NOSENKO mentioned in
January 1964 that he had received the Order of Lenin "shortly
after the 1962 meetings with us," as a result of ideas he
developed on how to-enlarge the experience and improve the
quality of staff personnel on the job. About a month later he
mentioned to one of his security guards that he had received a 2
large cash award (no date, but was then reluctant to say why; it l
is not clear whether this is Separate from the medal mentioned
earl ier). Now, such medals and awards are not given for routine

contributions, However, it is possible that NOSENKO could not
re ¢ bragging about his medal (or féared~ that “we might hear of ies
it through other sources), and that he actually got it for his H
1962.meetings with_us == as_t the timing would suggest. In fact, |
on one “OSCaSION he pointedly asked whether hiS"1962" tise officer !
had received an award from the 1962 meetings with him. And the i- i
cash award may have been related to a report from ‘another source,
that some officers of the American Department of the Second Chief
Directorate had gotten cash awards for the recruitment of one or '
more Americans in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow around 1960 -- when
NOSENKO was in that Department.

5. Claim to have Worked in Place for Us: NOSENKO has |

repeatedly Said that he tried earnestl y,.t0.colect..every, bit ‘of |

Yet he clearly, did not try to collect even the most insignificant

Organization for the First Chief Directorate, which could be had
for the asking by a person in his position. The nearly 200 :

Department in January 1962. According to knowledgeable sources,

ty a provocation agent about to be put into contact with hostile ad’

‘ intelligence would usually be removed from his job, particulariy
if it was a relatively sensitive one, at least six months before
being sent out. This iS the exact pattern in NOSENKO's biography:
he left (at least ostensibly) the section working against the
American Embassy just a month after GOLITSYN's defection (and
about the time planning for a provocation would have begun) and
moved to the Tourist Department, whose targets and methods are
less sensitive, more transitory ~- and more numerous -- and whose
basic techniques had been well known to GOLITSYN, partly through
a detailed document GOLITSYN was known to have taken with him
from the Helsinki Residency. It is possible that NOSENKO did
not in fact move from the First.Department as early as he claims.

7.° Sourcing of Information: NOSENKO has provided information

and (2), which he has learned through other means. In the first
category we learned interesting details on methods and organization
although their essence was already known from GOLITSYN; and a

mass of names and identifying data on agents and agent candidates
which he claims to be the totality of his Department's successes
and which turn out to be practically worthless to us or the KGB,
His own position, however, has enabled..NOSENKO to play a role in
some more notorious events: the OSWALD case, the__Icase, th
BARGHOORN case, etc., which are of interest. But much of
NOSENKO's more interesting information came from outside his Ft
immediate periphery. His accounts of how he got these other
items provide an interesting aspect of the bona fides problem.
