4. On 5 April 1965, James Wilcott advised a representative of EAB
that while visiting with members of an integration movement, he had come
in contact with an individual who professed to be a member of the Communist
Party. Although the reasons for his contacts with these individuals are
not entirely clear, a review of Subject's statements reflects the follow-
ing: On 10 April 1965, James Wilcott, hereafter referred to as Subject,
was in contact with one Ray Robinson Junior (NR-OS Indices), a representa-
tive of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. Robinson asked
Subject to come to 1618 Corcoran Street, Washington, D. C. to meet a number
of integration movement people. According to Subject's statements, when
he arrived at this address a group of about eight people were sitting around
“@rinking and smoking marijuana." Among these was one Alex Passikloff
(NR-OS Indices), a self-admitted Communist.

5. After various discussion with members of the group, Subject agreed
to drive Passikloff and one Alfred Smith, a student at Howard University,
to.New York City. They arrived in New York City about 5:00 a. m. on 11 April

~ 1965, and went-to the apartment’ of friends of Passikloff, identified as

Joseph A, and Betty Rotandi (NR-OS Indices). The Rotandi's are also de-

_.seribed as dedicated Communist Party members. During this day, Subject,

assikioff and the others visited an individual identified as Blyden Jackson
(NR-OS Indices) who is the head of a new organization called Council for
Jobs and Freedom of New York (NR-OS Indices). Subject and others also
"ended up" at the West Side W. E. B. Dubois Club in New York City. (The

W. E. B. Dubois Clubs are well identified as a new National Marxist organi-
zation, ea by J. Edgar Hoover as "spawned by the Communist Party,

U. Ss. A.

6. There are a number of questions currently unanswered in the case
of the Subject persons. Among these are: How long has James Wilcott
been involved in the SNCC movement?; Where was Elsie Wilcott during the
trip to New York City; and Why did James Wilcott allow himself to become
involved in this matter to the extent of going to New York City with these
persons and visiting other individuals who are allegedly self-admitted
Communists?

7. Subject has apparently reported to his station at JMWAVE. How-
ever, it is believed that his involvement with the aforementioned individuals
is extremely serious, for the most part because of unanswered questions.
Therefore, it is considered that he should be interviewed in depth as soon
as possible regarding his involvement in this matter. It is recommended

CONFIDENTIAL


>. GONFIDENTIAL

that the Security Officer, JMWAVE be briefed on this case and asked to
conduct a comprehensive interview of Subject.
