AHPASHA - Anti-American Propaganda Material Circulating in Japan

ICTICY REGURS- RESEE FOr your information.

DIRECIOR 49260

Forwarded herewith is a pamphlet prepared by the Japan

"Peace for Vietnam" Committee (BEHEIREN) for distribution to U.S:

servicemen stationed in Japan or visiting Japan.

. BEHEIREN activists

are distributing these pamphlets outside major U.S. bases throughout

BEHEIREN had planned to drop copies of this pamphlet over

the USS ENTERPRISE and the U.S. Navy Base at Sasebo during the

ENTERPRISE's visit there this month.

However,

this planned action

fell through due to BEHEIREN's inability to obtain the cooperation

of a Japanese newspaper, DINAMI KYUSHU SHIMBUN, in obtaining a

helicopter for the exercise.

POFRAGRANCE/1 obtained this pamphlet

from BEHEIREN headquarters in Tokyo on 16 January.

2. FJTA-53886, which forwarded a locally distributed BEHEIREN

propaganda poster, was not designated MHPASHA but might appropriately

have been so designated.

Also forwarded herewith is a clipping from the ICP's
