DIRECTOR 49260

1. Forwarded herewith is a pamphlet prepared by. the Japan.
"peace for Vietnam" Committee (BEHEIREN) for distribution to U.S.
Servicemen stationed in Japan or visiting Japan. . BEHEIREN activists
are distributing these pamphlets outside major U.8. bases throughout
Japan. BEHEIREN had planned to drop copies of this pamphlet over
the USS ENTERPRISE and the U.S. Navy Base at Sasebo during the
ENTERPRISE's visit there this month. However, this planned action
fell through due to BEHEIREN's inability to obtain the cooperation
of a Japanese newspaper, MINAMI KYUSHU SHIMBUN, in obtaining a

helicopter for the exercise. POFRAGRANCE/1 obtained this pamphlet

from BEHEIREN headquarters in Tokyo on 16 January.
