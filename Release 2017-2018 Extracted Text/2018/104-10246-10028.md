SUBJECT : LIONION Project

1. LIONION is a new project which is submitted in the
amount of $10,478. This is a photographic surveillance opera—

tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Two
eeents are involved; LIONTON-1, a young Cuban he exile,
and LIONION-2, The agents act as ObSérVeérs and

photographers. “LTONIONSY is also used as a dispatcher for the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team, from which he is compartmented, :
to cover individuals associated with thie target.__These agents

wae previously used in connection with the ilateral/ tele-
a

phone tap operation against the Cuban Embassy. ‘He current

photographic operation began in the lattes part of 1962,
pnd was previously funded under Cuban FI undo. The operation
has provided valuable data for the identification of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors, and on thers patterns of
action and personal associations.

2. The security of this operation, particularly the
agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,
wopear Feasonably sound. Both agents know thet they are
working for AIS, and LIONION-1was successfully FLUTTERED
in October 1963: “However, LITAMIL-7/ and LITAMIL-9/ who are
Pergerations of the Cuban Embassy;—are aware oti His

Identification, This is a technical (primarily Photographic) surveillance
operation against the PERUMEN Enbassy in Mexico City.

Objectives. The operation 1s designed to (1) furnish Photographic coverage
during daylight hours of the entrances of the target installation, (2)
dispatch physical Surveillance teams against PErSOnS associated with the
target, ang (3) keep in readiness a listening Post for the monitoring ang
recording of eventual technical Penetration operations of the target.

D. Operational Assets (Personnel).

LIONION-1 is a young PBRUMEN jin exile. He left PBRUMEN in 1960,
Planning to continue on via Mexico to the United States where he resided in
his carly_years. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer

in_the, |in Washington, the other a police official in
error Moria, Walls ta Na¥ico LIONION-1 vas recruited, as LILILY-1, to
‘perform PERUMEN operational support services for the Station and, once havi:
ataste of clandestine decided to remain in Mexico. niowror-2,/-
[lwas recruited as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and
ratoy in the LIFEAT, ODE tex eration aimed at’ the
Sesy. At this same time LIONIGN=l-also phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work end

~“the-two worked together as a team. In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked
together in processing the take of, the LIFEAT/LIERODE/MKTRAP installation, now
imown as LIOMEN. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-1 and
2 to LIFEUD-22 and 23, respectively. In the latter part of 1962 the two agents
began the present photographic surveillance operation.

LIONTON-1 was granted an OA on 18 May 1962 by HMMW-1066h. He was |
LCBLUITERED on 8 October 1963, HMNH-1206l..

LIOQNION-2 was granted an OA ga 16 May 1962 by EMMW-10660.

LIONION-1 is the mainstay of [the operation. LIONION-2 acts as his assistant
and fill-in at such times as he ig absent from the observation post. Both serve
principally as observers and photqgraphers. LIONION-1 also acts as a dispatcher
for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team from which he is compartmented. Dispatching
is done by radio using pre-arranged. innocuous code terminology; the team does not
‘mow LIONION-1 or his precise location. LIONION-1 also processes on the premises
all photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping
end mounting. Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through the

negative development stage. ; H

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of
the agents, that as PERUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might
ve brought upon them by KUBARK through the Mexican government should they get out
of line, Motivation is.a combination of financial necessity and violent aversion
to, and determination to bring abdut the downfall of, the AMTHUG regime. An
additional motivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what for many would
be monotonous work. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of work.

Both agents realize that they ere working for PHPRIME intelligence; LIONION-1
appears to be aware that he is working for KUBARK. The cover utilized by LIONION-2
is that of ON-1 passes as a would-be who cen afford
to-dabble without success because. of family landholdings in
Florida (inherited fi S deceased father), which enable him to live as
@ “rentista," one who lives on income from sources other than gainful employment.
His rentista status is registered with the Mexican government. In October 1964
this cover successfully withstood intensive investigation by Mexican authorities
checking on persons of questionable status for tax collection purposes. The
Station_plans_to bolster the| cover with supporting documents from a

lin New York Citys thése will be requested in separate correspondence



Commmication is priuarily with LIONION-1; with LIONION-2 only in his
absence. Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls
from LIONION-1 go through a telephone cut-out), are usually held at the
LIONION-1 safe apartment. This apartment, which would appear to be a LIONION-2
love nest, is in another area of town. The Station KURIOT technician,

Hugh T. FRANCOTTE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week. The Case Officer,
Lawrence F, BARKER, meets with him less frequently. Whereas LIONION-1 knows
the true name of the Case Officer, he does not Imow FRANCOETE's true identity.

E. Security Evaluation, If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican
authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed
to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMWAVE
area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering
their income. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flagrante.
with the KURLO? automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such
refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.
In any event, LIONION-1 hes a close relationship with en official of the Mexican
president's office. This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,
enabled him to weather the tax invéstigation and can be used by him to overcome any
future difficulties with Mexican authorities.

Under Mexican law, the principal (photographic) activity of the project is
not illegal, therefore uncovering of the photographic operation would not of
itself result in arrest or prosecution, It is usuelly possible to stave off
investigation or house search for a period of time sufficient to remove compromis-
ing material from the premises. The LIONION base house was once cleaned completely
in one evening and could agein be cleaned, probably in less time, if circumstances
should warrant.

‘The target installation is aware that photo surveillance is a probability.
On one occasion AMKNOB-1, a JMHAVE asset, was shown a nearby building (not the
LIONION base) by & PERUMEN Embassy officer and told that it was a KUBARK photo

dase. |

LIONION-1 is known by sight to some PHRUMEN Embassy staff personnel who have
observed him in the neighborhood. ‘Presumably they believe he is a Mexican. To
avoid operationsl compromise, he cannot renew his expired passport at the
pane Consulate. For this reason the Station will request |

Security measures employed in'this operation are designed to make it virtually
impossible for any opposition service to link LIONION personnel with the Station.

F. Coordination. Coordination with other PBPRIME elements or the Mexican government
is not necessary at this time and none is envisaged.
