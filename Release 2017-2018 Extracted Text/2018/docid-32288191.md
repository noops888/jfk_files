He stated that he was an employee of GEORGE C.

WILKINSON for a period of 15 years during which time the

to his

knowledge,

operat state type ViNs over to of his

own,

although he used to like to gamble and habitually

went to Cuba to spend time there at the area known as

Verderado (phonetic) Beach.

While in Cuba, WILKINSON would shoot craps at

the little casinos there, but other than playing poker

with friends and occasional bet with an acquaintance on a

football game or basketball game, he never actively engaged

in gambling.

TP T-10 stated that while in Cuba, WILKINSON

presently resides in Fort Lauderdale,

pecson a resides in for La descare, torida, somewhere

near where WILKINSON lives now

Becäuse of this association

with BUSTAMONTE,

it was rumored in Mobile at one time that

WILKINSON brought thousands of dollars out of Cuba at the

time of the Castro revolution:

TP T-10 stated he knew

personally this to be a false

rumot

but said that WILKINSON

liked to have such

rumors being passed around as that lent

credence to his way of life and indicated to people that

he had a considerable amount of money.

TP. T-1O said that WILKINson has over the years,

made and

lost a great deal of money and in one deal alone,

received one million dollars for his share in an insurance

company

stated that at present, WILKINSON is devoting

his full time to an insurance company, name unrecalled,

that during the previous week, he had

attempted to interest

TP T-10 in selling his used car business and investing in

this insurance company

TP T-lO stated that since he had

devoted his while life

to the used car business, he had no

desire to leave this business to start another oné.

TP T-10 further stated that WILKINSON is the type

of individual who keeps all money in his possession

invested in various enterprises and at one time, purchased

a motel in Mobile for one hundred thousand dollars,

which he borrowed ninety thousand dollars from the bank

and five thousand dollars from TP T-10, but rumors indi-

cated he was the sole owner of the enterprise.

As an

example of how little cash WILKINSON keeps, TP I-10 stated

that often, he borrows money in twenty and fifty dollar

amounts when in Mobile because his finances are all tied

up in investments.
