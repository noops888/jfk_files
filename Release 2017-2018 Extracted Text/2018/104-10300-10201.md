LE OSWALD IT RUSSIA

(e) On 23 February 1964, as SUBJECT approached the table for

the evening meal, he noted that the Time magazine lying on the coffee

table in the living room had a picture of Marie OSWALD. As he sat

down he hit the table with his list and sald,

"I feel that I could

have stopred OSWALD", At this point Special Agent Stanley C. TACIl

asked him "how!". lle proceeded to state that he (SUBJECT) was head

of the KCB Tourist and Visitors Section which kept control over the

activitles of OStALD while he vas in the Soviet Union. He said at

the time, OSTALD was of no special concern or interect to the KGB

because he lacked Inteligence backeround therelore, When he eppited

Cor permission to leave hussia, they (KGB) under his (SUBJECT) dizectiou

informed OSWALD that he would have to make his application through the

appropriate channels of the State Department, who In turn vould request

his velcase from the Russian counterparts in handling of visas.

* This

ho said vas all done for propaganda and show purposes, He went on to

done on the spur of the moment, but since OSWALD had nothing and vas

not worch anything, they decided that this was an opportunity to show

the Anerican State Department that they did not mind releasing individ-

uals it they applied for release through the appropriate channels.

Prior to this application for release of OSAID, the SUBJECT stated

chat since he vas or no particular satezest co then and there was

nothing in Moscow that they could use him for or place him into, they

decided that they would send OSWALD to lilnsk where he would be placed

in a factory working on mdios in the hope that some training in the

clectrical and clectronic field might result in his development into

an electronies engincer; however, he showed no capability in this field.

The sUBJICT then stated that it was just at this period, before sending

OSWALD to ilinak,

that a very strange thing happened.

OSHALD was supposed to have a meeting with a travel agent in regard

to preparations for his going to Minsk at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

At 6 o'clock he still did not report to the travel agent, so the travel

agent decided to do to the hotel where OSWALD was steying to see if he

could locate him.

proceeded to OSWALD's roOm. He tried the door, but the door was locred.

le knocked, got no response, and then with the assistance of the ciet

they broke Into the room and found OSWALD lying across the bed with both

of his wrists slashed.

The travel agent and the clerk responded trmediately

by taking OSWALD to the near-by medical facillty where he was alven blood

transfusions and after a period of time regained his strength. During the

Investigation the following day the SUBJECT stated that the doctor indicatod

that had OSWALD not been found for approximately ben more minutes, he vould

have been dead. It is here that the SUBJECT agaln pounded the table and

said it the travel agent had not broken into the room, but had instead

contacted the KGB office ilke they are lascrucied to when they do not

get any response from people tich waom they heve appoingnents, chas he

(SUBJECI) would have most likoly dirocted the travel agent to zorget

about him, and on the following dey or later that evening he would have

sent one of the KGB agents to check on OSAID, at which time he vould

have been found dead

This, he went on to state, 1s what hurts him

then he realizes that he could have been instrunonial in disposing of

OSWALD without any special inquiry or serious investigation, OSWAID

being nothing, and at the same time today the President of the Untted

States, President KENNDy, would be alive. The SUBJECT then went on

to state that after OSVALD was sent to Minck it was thore that ha mot

Marie. Like himself (OSWALD), Marie vas a girl fron a peasant famtly

with no special background and sonewhat illiterate. It was because

of her poor background that she was given permision to marry OSWALD

and return to the United States as his wife.
