The SUBJECT also indicated that his father was a shipbuilder and

a Naval Cadet. He was celled into the service before graduating from
what 1s our equivalent of a high school. He had taken part in the
fighting in the Black Sea Area where he deseribed hand-to-hand combat
with Germans, claimed he was wounded, and beceuse of his bravery he

was avarded the Soviet Order Medal and the Order of Stalin. The SUBJECT

stated this was unusual for a person of his age and gained him great
respect. At the end of the war he had no more desire for military lite
although his superiors tried to keep him in the military. Instead, he
went for four years to the Institute of Foreign Relations and learned
the English language. Upon graduation, a man came to him and told him
that he had a job lined up for him. He stated thet this actually was
more like being ordered to take this particular job which tured out

proceeded to OSWALD's room. He tried the door, but the door was loved.
He knocked, got no response, and then with the assistance of the ele
they broke into the room and found OSWALD lying across the bed with both
of his wrists slashed. The travel agent and the clerk responded dimudiately |
by taking OSWALD to the near-by medical facility where he was given blood |
transfusions and after a period of time regained his strength. During the |
iavestigation the following day the SUBJECT stated that the doctor Indleated |
that had OSWALD not been found for approximately ten more minutes, he would
have been dead. It is here that the SUBJECT again pounded the table and
said if the travel agent had not broken into the room, but had Instead

SUBJECT) would have most likely directed the travel agent to forget
about him, and on the following dey or later evening he would have
sent one of the KGB agents to check on OSWALD, at which time he would
have been found dead. This, he went on to state, ia what hurts him
when he realizes that he could have been instrumental in‘ disposing of
OSWALD without any special inquixy or serious investigation, OSWALD
being nothing, and at the same time’ today the President of the United
States,’ President KENNEDY, would be alive. The SUBJEC? then went on’ ¢
to state that after OSWALD was sent to Minsk 1% was there that he met
Marie. Like himself (OSWALD), Marie was a girl froma peacant family
with no special background and somewhat illiterate, It was because
of her poor background that she was given permission to marry OSWALD
and return to the United States as his wife.

The SUBJECT then went oa to deseribe what took place on the day
that President KENNEDY was assassinated, He eald that this was actually
on Saturday in Moscow, the 22nd of Novenber, He was hone at time
ond happened to have the radio on, when he heard that the Presideut of
the United States had been assassinated. Appro:cimntely one hour later,
the radio Informed him that the assassin was Lee OSWALD. ‘This announcement,
he said, really stunned hin. He grabbed his coat and dashed to his effiee.
Immediately upon his arrival he searched for the OSWALD file. When he
found the file he reviewed it and found that OSWALD had not been used
or even approached for use by the Russian Intelligence. He put ina
long distance call to the Chief of the KOB Section in Minsk and inquired
whether they had used, trained or prepared OSWALD in any vay for intelli-
gence activity. The Chief informed him that according to what he could |
recall, they had not made any use of OSWALD... Just about this time, he i

SUBJECT'S FATHER

{1) The SUBJECT also made reference to his father during this
meal, describing him as a very tall and extremely well-built individual,
and one who was extremely Intelligent and a self-made, self-educated
man. He learned the shipbuilding trade mostly through his om research
and study, and also from the SUBJECT's grandfather, who was one of the
first shipbuilders im Russia. The SUBJECT added that his grandfather
died at the age of 94. He also stated that after the death of his
father, a memorial was built in his memory since he was considered
a very capable director of the government shipping industry. ‘That
was about the last time he saw his mother and brother and sister, as
they all went to this ceremony in honor of his father. He also
indicated that there was a periodical which gave a complete run-down
on his family background, including that of his grandfather and his
father, and it was well publicized; and this he believes had a lot
to do with his being able to get some special preference and move
along as fast as he did in the KGB organization.

KCB_PRESSURE ON FAMILY

(4) On e7 February 1964 during lunch, the SUBJECT stated that he

has been informed that the KGB is putting pressure on his immediate |
family, particularly his mother. However, he said he waa not overly {
worried about her because she 1s well-off financially, and being up i
in age there is not mich they can do to her. However, what concerns |
him most is the fact that they have already started to play on the H
sympathies of his two children and his wife. The SUBJECT stated that
he was anticipating this; however, he did not think that they would

start so soon to pressure the family. However, he does have some hope
that in due time he may be able to get his family out of Russia. This
hope he sald was given to him by the Chief of SR Division. |

{k) On 25 February 1964 during a sightsceing tour of Washington
by vehicle, as we passed the Library of Congress, the SUBJECT pointed |
to the building and stated that "we have people working in there". ‘
Special Agent Stanley C. LACH said, "who is 'we'?" and the SUBJECT
answered, "KGB". He continued by stating that this was a good place
to place people because they could readily learn by just vatehing
vhat research was being done in the Library of Congress by the military
