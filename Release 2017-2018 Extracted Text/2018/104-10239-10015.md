REFERENCE 2 WHC Memorandum 65-86 dated

1 March 1965,

When a headquarters? cause officer in one of the opera-
fhonal departinents wishes to send a dispiteh or cable to the ficld,
he prepares the message himself (on his own typewriter) and
sends it to the Department of Legal Centers office (if it is golng
to a field station) for transmission by the means imicated, He
may handcarry the message to Le Centers or may send it by
his department driver or an M Building messenger. A driver

or messenger may be summoned by telephone at any tune, but
there are always headquarters! messengers circulating among
buildings carrying dispatches and other correspondence from

one to another, The operations! officer, therefore, may wait

for the next messenger to come over from M Building or may
call one, The messengers operate on no fixed schedule but
deliver messayes as they are received or ready for dispatch,

2, An outgoing message from the LN Department to the
field station in Mexico, for example, is prepared by the LN
case officer and sent by messenger or carried personilly to the
Mexican section (Nucleus 5) of the MS (Legal Centers) De-
partment, That department, if it 1s to go by dispatch, photo-
graphs the message and places the resultant microfilm in the next
pouch to Mexico. MS Department has its own equipment for
photouraphing, preparing microfilm, and developing microfilm,
£11 outgoing message is prepared in originai and one copy; the
copy is returned by the MS Department to the originating officer,
with a stamp showing the out nuniber and the date and time of
dispatch, if the message is to go by cable, the MS Department
forwards it to the Central Ciphering Service of the DSE, which
has the communications facilities and which encodes the message

before sending it. Cables are handled through commercial cable
channels,

3. If the outgoing message requires cover language of any

. sort, the preparing operations‘ officer writes it with a simple

i: number substitution for classified or sensitive names and ex-
pressions (example: #1 - Nicaragua; #2 - FLN; #3 - passports;

#4 - Jose GARCIA, etc. ), using numbers instead of reai names or
terms, With the text of the message containing the numerical
code, he supplies 2 list of the numbers and the terms or names
-they represent, The Central Ciphering Service encodes the
message with the numbers in it and also the list of number-
terra equivalents and transmits the two items to the field station
by commercial cable. Cable messages leave the DGI office
through “VIDALINA" and incoming decoded messages from the
Central Ciphering Service go to her and then to the MS Department
for distribution to the proper recipients, The standard term E
"PABLO" ts used on all outgoing cables as sender,

4, When the cable message arrives at the field station,
the embassy code clerk receives it and decodes it, He then
passes the encoded text of the message and the number-term
substitution list, Lf any, to the chief of the field station, who
passes it to the officer concerned, In. no case does the opera-
tions! officer at either end see the encoded message or know what
code is used, aside from the number-term substitution list
prepared by the originator and given to the addressee in decoded
form. Only the code clerk and the chief of the field station
know anything about the codes or coding process,

5. For incoming messages by cable or pouch, the system
is the same, The field operations’ officer prepares the message,
with a number-term substitution list if needed, and submits ft to
the field station chief, If the message is to go by pouch, the
field station.chief has it photographed and sends the results on
microfilm; he has equipment for microphotography and development,
If the message is to xo by cable, he submits it with the substitution
List to the mission code clerk, who encodes message and
accompanying list and transmit them by commercial cable.

6, Both pouches and cables are addressed to the Ministry
of Foreiga Relations (MINREX), When the Ministry of Foreign
Relations receives a pouch, it sends the part of the conterits
addressed to the DGI to DGI headquarters by messenger



al

(sometimes the regular courier from abroad delivers them),
They are received.by "VIDALINA" and distributed through the
MS Department to the proper addressees, When the message

is sent by cable, it gues from the Ministry of Foreign Relations
to the Central Ciphering Service, which decodes it and sends

a paraphrased version to "VIDALINA" for distribution in the DGL

: 7, Incoming messages in Havana show the date and time
received by the. cee Ciphering Service (entered on a standard
form) and the mes: number (also entered on a standard form),
The Central Ciphering Service also enters the time at which it
dispatches the message to the DGI, and the DGI headquarters
stamps the incoming message with the date and time of receipt.
The date and. time of receipt are also stamped on the message

by the department office of the addressee. Cables in the Zapote
Operation file show that a message from Mexico received by the
Central Ciphering Service at 1850 hours was delivered to the DGI
headquarters at 2350 hours and reached the LN Department, to
which it was addressed (determined by the pseudonym of the

case officer), on the following morning. Since it was a routine
message, it was held over at the late hour of delivery until the
next day, for internal distribution,

8, In preparing reports in the field, the field operations’
officer usually interviews the agent and then writes the report
on the basis of what the agent told him, putting in numbers for
names or criticalterms, The message is then microfilmed and
dispatched, In one instance, when an operations’ officer from
Havana was visiting Mexico, he asked an agent for a written
report on expenditure of funds with which he had been entrusted,
The agent prepared the report but did not get it to the embassy in
time for the case officer to carry it back to Cuba with him. In
that instance, the field case officer sent the agent's original
report direct to headquarters by pouch without photographing it,
possibly because hé was hurrying to get it into a departing pouch,
The procedure is noted as unusual, :

9, The code clerks assigned to Cuban official missions
abroad are all members of the DSE but while in the field are
subordinate to the chief of the DGI field station, When a code
clerk is required, the DGI asks the DSE to supply one. Bt is
not known whether the code clerk also handles the normal Foreign
Ministry coded traffic and, if he does, whether he uses the same

ae


“4

codes for it as for the DGL_ To all intents and purposes a code
clerk abroad is a member of the DGL

10, - Radio communication between field stations and : :
headquarters. in Havana is almost never used and is regarded as
strictly an emergency measure, although field stations have
radio equipment (type unknown) for use if needed, DGI headquarters
receives almdst no.radio.messages from field stations. The DGE
field atation in Mexico has a plan for emergency radio communi-
cations with Havana to relay messages through the Dominican
Republic if normal radio transmission direct to Havana is
interrupted, This arrangement, however, is only a plan; no
implementation of it has ever been attempted, .as far as is known,
and it is extremely doubtful that relay facilities of any kind
‘actually exist in the Dominican Republic which could be used in
an emergency,
