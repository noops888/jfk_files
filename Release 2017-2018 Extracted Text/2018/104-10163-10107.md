ACTION REQUIRED:

I, INTRODUCTION

A. Bubject! Specific assignments have been delimited for the past
two years by several considerations beyond his control: :

Prior to the Bay of Pigs, Subject was used as ® principal
nt in exile operations which were semi~covert at best. In the proces:
he was thoroughly blown as a KUBARK agent, =

2, After the Bay of Pigs, those Cuban exiles who blamed the U~.8B,.
Government for’the defeat found Subject an oasy targetof their wrath,
Subject stcunchly defended the U.S. ection (or lack of action), and
thereby won himself a number of bitter enemies among the exiles,

3. As.an outgrowth of points 1 and 2 above, Subject's atatenenta
and opinions on the situation in.Cuba, or on the Worth of individuals or
grou in exile, were either mistake: y. considered to be “official leaks,

er else were deliberately exaggerated and twisted. in going around the
exile community,

B, To remedy this situation, Subject's cover as a prizefight
manager was strengthened by more actual participation in the activities
of his boxer, and supplemented by a backstopped cover firm which pure
portedly used his service a translator and consultant, Instead of

DISPATCH

trying to put Subject into deep cover, which was izpractical, the vague
Jegend was allowed to circulate that he still retained direct contact
with KUBARK but was no longer involved in operations, He was given
strict instructions to make it clear to anyone volunteering information
that he would promise only to forvard the report through proper channels.
and that if there was any intere:.t in follow-up or operational involve-
ment, it would be expressed through some other channel, By and large,
this effort has been successrui, und Subject can be considered at this
juncture fully extricated from Ms former adverse operational situation,

TI, RECRUITMENT

A, Subject was a regular contact of ODENVY. when turned over to
KUBARK in mid 1959,

B. Recruitment was not covert, Subject knew that he was dealing
with KUBARK,

Cc. Recruitment was handled by the COS, Havana Station in true
name,

D, Subject was originall
information using the natural
Government,

Y recruited aw a source of political
access piovided by his job with the Cuban

Z. Salary at the time of recruitment was in terms of Spot payments
for operational expenses, After Bubjoct and his family were evacuated
from Cuba in 1960 he

put on contract at $300 per month, His salary
is now $500. per month, © i -

TIX, SECURITY STATUS
A. POA - No record at JMWAVE,:

B, OA -. Written contract and contract check sheet in Subject's
201 file give evidence that appropriate clearance formalities were

completed successfully at Headquarters, but the details are not availabl
at JMWAVE,

C, Subject passed his LCFLUTTER in April 1964, Results were
forwarded to Headquarters in UFGA — 15349,

D, Although Subject has a great love of "the game," he tends to
favor the less covert aspects of operations auch investigation and
interview, This !2 a natural outgrowth of his police experience,

EB, Tere are no major violations of security om Subiect's record.
Due to the semi-cvert assignments he carries eet amorg large numbers of
witting contacts in the early days of JMAAVE activities, he was bereft

of any workable cover by :id-100% whan tha undersigned took him over,
From that date to the present there have nen a
Subject "claimed to represent KUBARK" or stated that “KUBARK policy

Was.eoe" It should be noted that his recent LCFLUTTEX gave no con~
firmation of any such allegations, ‘

sensing valuable leads and following them up with pertinent questions,

B, He is not deft at elicitation, and he seems to be aware of this
shortcoming, He prefers the straight interview which he reports fully
and accurately, and then adds footnotes with his comments,

C, His comments are sometimes as valuable as the reports, and
usually they at least enhance the value of his reports, .Yuese. comments
are based on recollections from his long and wide experience with the
Cuban problem, and on the voluminous Personal files which he has
established and maintained. on individuals and groups of interest,

D. He is also a tireless leg man when tracking down an odd bit of
information, and he has shown a good amount of personal courage in
dealing with chara:ters known for violence,

E, On the deficit side, it should be noted that having been so
closely involved, Subject is not without strong opinions on many of the

matters he revorts, and finds it difficult to be completely objective
in his choice of words, Ef

VII, FUTURE POTENTIAL

4, Ilis operational potential would appear to be quite good if
firmness and determination to succeed are factors, He probably would

be more effective in an operation where mental toughness rather than
tact and guile wan required,

B. Because of his language proficiency and area knowled, oe, he
should stay in anti-Cuban operations as long as it fearible, He
might be considered for a move out of the JMWAVE a however, and

probably ‘could function well in any of the Latin American countries
except Brazil,

VIII, RECOMMENDED TRAINING

Subject completed a six-~weeks basic tradecraft course in
September 1964, His next training assignment should be based on his
specific operational use in the future _—___. sv1ES SE SSEETESET;SEISTEHEISE
