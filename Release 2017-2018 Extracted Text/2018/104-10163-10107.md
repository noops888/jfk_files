two years by several

considerations beyond his control:

Prior to the Bay of Pigs, Subject was used as a principal

agont in

exale operations which were

send-covert at best.

In the process

he was thoroughly blown as a KUBARK agent.

2. After the Bay of Pigs, those Cuban exiles who blamed the U.S.

Government for the defeat found Subject an easy targetof their wrath,

Subjoct atsunchly defended the U,S, rction (or lack of action), and

thereby won himself a number of bitter enemies anong the exiles.
