the request of MEROLA, made to Departmental Attorneys
WILLIAM KENNY and WILLIAM KEHOE.

Prior to the commencement of the interview on 8/14/61, DJ

conditions that the Departmental Attorneys be present;
that he would never testify to any Information furnished;
that he requested his identity be protected so that none of
i his information ever could be traced back to him;and that

G2-2Yo-

On August 14, 1961, and on August 15, 1961, JOSEPH RAYMOND
MEROLA, 2018 North Bay Road, Miami Beach, Florida, was inter-
viewed at Room 201, Federal Building, Miami, Florida, by

SA JOHN S, PORTELLA and SA THOMAS G, FORSYTH III in the
presence of U. S. Department of Justice Attorneys WILLIAM
KENNY and WILLIAM KEHOE, who were there at the insistence

of MEROLA. At the outset, MEROLA stated he would never testify
to any of the information furnished, and he desired his
identity be protected. MEROLA advised as follows:

GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka;
SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

A. PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

Name Change 7

No information has ever been received why the MANNARINO family
name waS legally changed from RUGGIERO to MANNARINO.

Marriage of GABRIEL MANNARINO

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO's wife, JEAN, had no choice in her
selection of mate, The marriage was arranged between her
father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., and KELLY MANNARINO,

JOSEPH PETER MANNARINO, aka, JOJO - Brother

JOJO MANNARINO, who suffers from a palsy-like twitching and
from severe stammering, is a "nut" and "con man." He has 4
dissipated the fortune of his wife, HAZEL, widow of motion
picture actor LEWIS STONE, in just a few years. KELLY and

SAM MANNARINO allow JOJO to come to New Kensington occasionally
on the conditbn that he "stays out of trouble," but JOJO always
does something to get into trouble, such as writing worthless
checks, and is forced to leave town, After such visits to

New Kensington, KELLY and/or SAM MANNARINO ordinarily make

good the amount of the worthless checks written by JOJO.

member of the "outfit," by birth ‘or by being "made." Whether
‘one is born into eligibility for admission into the "outfit"
: or one is made eligible, the only way one can become finally
. % accepted is by the commission of a murder, Every man who is
considered a "don! without exception, has at some time or
another killed someone. Once a man becomes a "don," the only
way he can cease being such and can leave the "outfit" is by
his death. The expression is used that "the door opens only
one way." %

In approximately the middle 1950's, KELLY. MANNARINO took a
great liking to JOSEPH MEROLA and on Several occasions told
friends that he "was making" MEROLA into a "don." On one
occasin, KELLY MANNARINO took MEROLA to New York City with
him where he introduced MEROLA to VITO GENOVESE and MIKE
MIRANDA, at which time KELLY told them he was making MEROLA
into a "don." On another occasion, KELLY MANNARINO gave
MEROLA a pakage and told him to.deliver it to New York City
without opening it, and when JOE MEROLA had delivered, the
package in New York City and it was opened, it was found to
contain only cut up newspaper. MEROLA was put to other tests,
such as arrests by the New Kensington, Pa., Police Department
all of which were designed to test him to see if he could be
trusted and would remain silent. Because of this experience
with KELLY MANNARINO, MEROLA became aware that all of the top
leaders, both Nationally and locally, of racketeering ae of
Italian extraction and are known to each other as "dons,"

Some of the "dons" in the Pittsburgh,. Pas, area are:

SAMUEL MANNARINO

KELLY MANNARINO

JOHN. CHRISTO PHER FONTANA,
all of New Kensington, Pa.;

JOHN LA ROCCA

MIKE GENOVESE

TONY RIPEPI

JOJO PECORA,

all of Pittsburgh, Pa.;

phases of the MANNARINO-controlled slot and pinball machines,
NORMAN ROTHMAN

NORMAN:-ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs in their Cuban
and some Florida interests for many years, ROTHMAN, like all
other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the
MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans
Souci Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN fronted for
them, ROTHMAN always emerges with money, ROTHMAN's Cuban
connections are over-rated and when anything actually difficult
is to be accomplished in Cuba, ROTHMAN ordinarily needs the
assistance of JOSE PH|MEROLA . Currently, ROTHMAN has’ the
franchise for the cocktail bar in the Bel Aire Hotel, Miami
Beach, Florida, and his two Sons are working at the bar, RoOTH-

MAN is, like SAM MANNARINO, an addict to cocaine, which he
sniffs.

ABE SEID, aka, Al Ross

Although AL ROSS has the reputation cissies of having killed
on many occasions, it is not believed that he deserves that
reputation. He has never been known to brag a
ings. ROSS,’ who is under order of deportation

nation which will accept him. ROSS is very much in love with
his wife, MORMA, who is a nymphomaniac currently residing on
Palm Island, Miami Beach, Florida. ROSS gives the appearance
of being a "tired old man," and he shows no enthusiasm for
taking part in any illegal activity to obtain money, even
though he is in serious financial straits.

JOHN. CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most
trusted lieutenan: : KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his
protege and made him a "don," After FONTANA's marriage about
a@ year and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out.
FONTANA ‘thought that he was not getting enough money and
complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all
he was going to get. FONTANA then made the serious mistake
of going over KRLY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN

LA ROCCA, who Subsequently reported this to KELLY -MANNARINO,
Since then FONTANA has been rel

and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO gant ing
activities, c

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,
there is no question that SAMUEL’ MANNARINO was part of the
conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to
Cuba.

Originally-the plans to take guns to Cuba were JOSEPH MEROLA's
plans and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO. In
the summer of 1958, AL ROSS told MEROLA that he could obtain
M21 rifles and carbines. MEROLA met ROSS at the Warwick Hotel,
New York City, and gave ROSS $4,000 as part payment for the
guns, which money MEROLA had received from CARLOS PRIO,.

MEROLA was to return to the Warwick Hotel with additional
money in a day or so and did so, but AL ROSS did not show up.
After MEROLA: returned to Miami, Florida, MEROLA learned from
Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO
was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because
MEROLA is a pilot and acquainted with airplaneg, he looked
over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and
advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too defective.
After that, MEROLA assisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin
Beech airplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONT, Miami,
Florida. When Dr. PESSOLANO told MEROLA that MANNARINO intended
to use the airplane to fly guns to Cuban dictator BATISTA, he
realized that these were the guns that had been promised to
him and that he was being double-crossed. _MEROLA then apranged
with Dr. PESSOLANO for MEROLA to accompany the pilot, STUART
SUTOR, on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose
of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the double-
cross, After SUTOR and MEROLA landed at Allegeny Airport,
Pittsburgh, they took a cab to MEROLA's sister's house ‘in the
Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car.

They drove to the Tour-Tel Motel on U. S. Route 22, Monroeville,
where they registered for the night. MEROLA and SUTOR then
traveled to New Kensington, where MEROLA attempted to locate
SAM MANNARINO. MEROLA was unable to locate SAM MANNARINO, so
he went to Wilmerding, Pa., to the house of "Sarge" BOTTI,
where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.
KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to
smuggle guns to Cuba, that this was one of SAM :MANNARINO's
"hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with
it. MEROLA then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of Eastern
Airlines, It was not until the pilot, STUART SUTOR, was

on ec es

DocId:32303145 Page 8


stopped with the second load of guns, resulting in consider-
able newspaper publicity, that MEROLA realized that the
weapons had’been stolen from a National Guard Armory in,
Canton, Ohio. MEROLA later learned from a source he could not
recall that the burglary of the armory was committed by
GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a "inside
man," and that the guns had been stored in the beer distribu-
torship owned by. VIC CARLUCCI in Arnold, Pa. RED GIORDANO,
who was convicted in this case merely because it was proven

’ he had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,
had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had’ nothing to do
with the case. ANDY MANGINI, who was never brought into the
case, actually helped load and unload the guns from CARIUCCI's
beer distributorship to the truck and from the truck to the
airplane,

lottery : Sree ’

HYMEN MARTIN, aka, PLPsSBURGH HYMIE, ysed to have the distributor-
ship in Western Pennsylvania. of the Empire Treasury lottey
tickets, and since he was friendly with the MANNARINOs, they
allowed his ticket to be sold at their numbers outlets in and
near New. Kensington, Pa. HYMIE MARTIN, with whom MEROLA became
friendly when MEROLA was a used car salesman in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
was the.one who first introduced MEROLA to the MANNARINOs, in .-
approximately 1954. MARTIN, who now resides in Miami, Florida,
probably turned over the distributorship of the Empire Treasury
lottery ticket to his brother, NATE MARTIN, who is still in

the Pittsburgh area.

Recently, "the outfit" has come out with the Pan American ;
Sweepstakes ticket, which is based on the running of the Dixie i
Handicap horse race at Pimlico Track, Maryland, in the near i
future... "The outfit" compelled KELLY MANNARINO to take 10,000

books of these sweepstakes tickets, which he must dispose ‘

of in his area of Western Pennsylvania. One of KELLY MANNARINO's
employees, known as "SHRIGGS,," undoubtedly will handle the ©

delivery of the sweepstakes tickets, as he currently does with

the Empire Treasury lottery tickets,

.Gambling Casino
The MANNARINO gambling casino in New Kensington, Pa., operates i

Seven nights a week. They are well patronized at this joint,
and they even send "luggers" to the Squirrel Hill section of

~ ye

DocId:32303145 Page 9


Pittsburgh, which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are ~
transported from that. section to New Kensington for the pur- an A
pose of .gambling. Routine employees at the gambling casino
receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the
$150 weekly salary plus a-small percentage of the net take.
It has been curious-in the past .to note that whenever they so
Gesire; KELLY MANNARINO or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the
“gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum
_of money, For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier
to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the
risk of being killed: -Employees at the casino do not carry

. weapons. generally, butm. occasions, when there is a rumor that
fl the. casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOs,
goes about town fully armed.

\. Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY. nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic
in narcotics or to operate prostitution.

Hideouts

During the long period of time, in excess of one year, that
KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas,
commencing in December of 1957, he. stayed at two places:

the house of "SARGE" BOTTI, in Wilmerding, Pa., and the house
of FRANK D, "SONNY" AMATO, the brother-in-law of KELLY
MANNARINO, who :.resideas.:. in East McKeesport, Pa.

During the period in 1958 when SAM MANNARINO was avoiding
. service of subpoena, he stayed, at least part of the time,
at the. parish house of Mount Saint Peters Roman Catholic
Church, New Kensington, Pa. y

F. POLICE PROTECTION AND POLITICAL TIES

New Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the majority .
of his City Council have been "owned" by the MANNARINOS, since ‘
- their election approximately eight years ago. At one time,
JOE MEROLA, at the instructions of KELLY/MANNARINO, "wired"
_,the New: Kensington City Council chambers, so that tape
recordings of the proceedings could be made.
