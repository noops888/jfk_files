MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LEOB/SRS

SUBJECT:

NAGELL, Richard Case - #264170

REF:

IN Cable 25955 ata 6 June 1968 from

OUT Cable 06625 ata 7 June 1968 to

15-18

15-18

Reference cables concern the claim of an individual appearing at

the Consul General's office in Zurich, Switzerland on 4 June 1968 that

he is one Richard Case NAGELI. NAGELI was sentenced to a 10 year term for

bank robbery on 9 June 1964 and is supposedly in a federal prison in Missouri.

GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness in his investigation

according to a news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January

1968.

The clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached.

file also contains a copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 prepared

in research on the GARRISON CASE.

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to

ascertain from the FBI if Subject is still in prison.

I did not receive reference IN Cable 25955 inttially. Attached is

a copy I obtained from OS Cable Desk. However, the original copy was

routed to SRS and it is possible some one else on the Staff is already

handling the matter.
