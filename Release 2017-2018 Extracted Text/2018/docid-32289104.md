of the DES and 2 Mexican Army demolition men recovering

the explosives. GUTIERREZ BARRIOS indicated that with

the information furnished by the Miami Office his men had

no difficulty in locating and recovering these objects.

Inasmuch as no individual descriptions of the photographs

were obtained from DES and they are basically self-

explanatory, no descriptive list is being set forth. (g)

As the Bureau and Miami are aware, on 5/3/67 a bomb

of low power was apparently thrown into the courtyard of the

Cuban Embassy at Mexico, D.F., and exploded underneath the

automobile usually occupied by the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico

JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ ARMAS. The DES is of the opinion that the

bombing is the work of some exile group very likely based in

[S

Jorida and on this basis a telephone call was made by th

Mexico City Office to Miami on 5/4/67 andas a result DESOLS

could be assured that FRANK FIORINI was in Miami on that

date

Leads to determine the whereabouts of otner logical

suspects, including the other Cuban suspects in this case,

are being

handled under the caption "ANTI-FIDEL CASTRO
