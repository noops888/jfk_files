“2 Subject's service to the FBI was “described by the FBI ina memorandum.
‘dated in January 1951 which was furnished to ‘the Army in very favorable, _terms

“and was considered "a valuable informant." In'a statement furnished to-#
Agency in November 1951 at the time we were checking on Subject, the FBI gan

As stated. ee subject rendered ¥aluable service to the ‘FBI. ssD
reports that his services with CIA have been satisfactory, These favorable
statements, however, are insufficient to answer a question which has not been :
answered in the ip bhikie saoaey material available as to why Subject was approached °
by the Communist Party to join: the Party and why they were, as Subject reports,
80 insistent upon his joining, At the time he joined the Party he was serving
as @ correspondence clerk in a wholesale food company in New York City, It is
possible that an answer exists in the fact that the FBI states that Subject
was of interest to them from August 1946 on, while Subject states that he did
not contact the FBI until November of 1946, The possibility exists that in-
the three months gap noted, Subject may have been laying, at the’ request o.
the FBI, the ground work for th contact oe the Party,

It is recommended, therefore, that this matter be discussed with Mr.
pich to determine if the FBI ever explored and was satisfied as to Sub-
t's conduct or activities prior to his being contacted by the Communist
Party functionaries,
