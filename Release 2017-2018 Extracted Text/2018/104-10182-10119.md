decide on action to te taken against caSTRS,

2. Subject said ke was invited to attend by Jorge BETEART, one
of the leaders of the crap. Also attending will be one SANCHEZ
Nunez (fru), who lives on his yacht in Hint, Subject said they are
interested in him because of his contacts with the world-wide Inter-
national Service, the news agency with which he is affiliated. He
said the Cuban opposition does not intend to let CaS7RO harvest the
next sugar crop. :

J}. Subject eid he would Like to atten! the reeting, but has
invested so much money in the Suben matter alreziy without any return,
that he cannot do so unless we are prepared to uniervrite his
attendance. I told hin that I would let him know.

4. In conference vith C/s¥/IIL, I reconzentei that we either
terminate Subject or put hin to work. C/sii/III end I egreed that be
should be terninate? for the following reasons:

a, fils motivation is obvious?y to use the agency as © source
of financing Zor his personal &

tion on Suben

§. On Z October I telked with Sub‘ect t
reported that there is a purchasing niss



Belgium trying to biy arms for the Joninican Republic. Subject . -.
seid ke had been phoned this infarnation by Manuel FIRESTONE, who
was there. “anorg the equipment vanted are six hundred walkie-talkie
radios, He said that Policarp> (obviously Policarpo SOLER) vas
killed because ‘he convinced PEDRicA to cooperate vith William dlex-
ander 73 why was acting as a double agent for CASTRO,

6. I told Subject that after due considerction of the risks to
him, the cost in tine and effort to hin, ani the risks and expenses
involved for the agency, balanced against assets generally available
throughout the intelligence community and his (Subject's) access to
additional information, it had been decided not to give him any
Qperetiona? tasks at this time. I esphasized that this vas no
reflection on his character, but that we felt that in the balence he
could not do enough to varrant using him at this time. I suggested
that since the bulk of the matters which come to bis attentice in
Connection with the Cuban natter take Place in the United States, he
Should report such Infornation to the FBI, Subject appesrod to
understand that ve would not use Mz and expressed his regret. The

conversation erded on a friendly note.
