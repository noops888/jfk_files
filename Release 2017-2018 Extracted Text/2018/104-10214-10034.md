The CIA began shipping arzs to the Doninican Republic in
late 1960, following a series of talks between US Consul Henry
Dearborn, Caief Polizical Officer John Parfield of the U3
Consulate, and Luis Aciaza Tio. Also involved in the plot vas
Antonio Inbert, who tad been Governor of Porto Pleta province.

talks continued between Dearton, Parfield and leaders o2 the
anti-Trujillo conspirecy. ‘Tovard the end of 1960, contact vas

ascertain fros the files the nature and the extent of U.S. support

of the plotters, including the passing to tiem of weapons out of the
U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Trujille. What ve casnot discover from the

files, despite quite massive docimentation, is how the coup group

wes organized. ‘The best single account ve find, and it is not wholly
accurate, is in a book by Robert Crassweller.* The main flaw in
the story is its faflure to identify the individvals with whom the

U.S. Goverment was actually working. Excerpts follow:

The plot vas organized oa the basis of two groups of
conspirators linked together by a Iaison that later proved
too fragile to bear the stresses laid upon it. Each group
had its purpose and its separate personnel.

‘he function of the Action Group was to assussinate
‘Trujillo and immediately present proof of its succes, in
the fora of Trujillo's corpse, to the second group, the
Political Group. ‘he latter vould then launch a coup, .
taking over the machinery of the government and the Armed
Forces.

The Action Group consisted of eight men. It appears to
have been Organized originally ty Generel Antonio Inbert
Barreras and Salvador Estrella. . .. . . They were joined
by Lieut. Amado Garcia Guerrero, a member of the military
corps attached to Trujillo in the National Palace; Antonio

To recap:

8. Assistant Secretary of State Rubottam told J. C. King

on 28 Jume 1960 that the U.S. Goverment was prepared to partict-
pate in the overthrow of the Trujillo regize to the extent of
Providing a stall number of sniper rifles for the removal of

key Trujillo people from the scene. Ceneral Cabell, as Acting

DCI, oa 1 July 1966 avproved delivering 12 Springfield rifles to

the Doninican dissidents by air drop

The rifles

Were never delivered.
b. On 10 February 1961 the chie? cf statioa cabled a
Suggestion that one szall-size, bigh-fire-pover weapon be

forvaried in each pouch. This suggestion was not acted upon.

of Consul General Dearbon for the pouching of three 38 caliber,
Saith aad Wesson Spectal pistols for delivery to key renbers

of the dissident group. Headquarters was preparing to pouch

in the EMDZED operaticral files that ike pistols were actually

the pistols but aprarently did not do so. ‘There is no indication

by a subsquent request Yor suonacaine guns.
a. Oa 26 March 1961 the station cabled a request for

permission to pass three seni-autonatic M-1 carbines plus

ammunition to! ‘The carbines and ammunition
were in the consulate, having been left by departed naval personnel.

The station requested that headquarters pouch magazines. Head-

quarters approved passing the carbines and ammunition and-pouched~

the magazines. The cable authorizing Passing the carbines was 7 at

released by the DD/P (Bissell).

‘The station cabled that the

carbines were pasSed to

of the dissidents, gave tke carbines to for

land gave them to Antonio de Ja taza, who reportedly kept



them in the trunk of his autozobile. It is probable that at least

onz of the caroines was taken to the scene cf the assassination

“yy de la Maza, but ve have no evidence thet itwas actually used

in the shooting. Ortiz, the SIM investigator, told the FBI that ee

the assassins who were apprehended and interregated spoke only ;

of the firing of a saved-off shotgun, revolvers, and pistols.
e. While at headquarters for consultations in early April

at the station on 19 April 1961. Headquarters cabled the station

on 17 April that the submachine guns were not to be passed to

the dissidents without additional headquarters approval. Despite

" repeated pleas from the Chief of Station and from the Consul

General, Washizgton continued to refuse authorization to pass

them. We think it is safe to conclude that the submachine guns

7 were never passed to the dissidents.

’ A final, and rather sorry, footaote: We do not kmow the

motivations of men-such as’

Amiaza Tio, and Antonio Imbert. The SIM interrogations of the plotters

it captured revealed that they vere not greatly notivated by a desire



to live ina free acd democratic republic. Most of then were
