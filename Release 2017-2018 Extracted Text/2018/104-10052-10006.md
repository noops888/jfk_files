CIA Component report on wiretap operations prepared by Paul

Levister entitled "ZRSOLO and ZRJOINT: Two Telephone Tap

Operations,"

pp. 10-11.

Hereinafter cited as Levister

Memo. Paul Levister pseudonym)

was a Headquarters tech

nician.

He was in Mexico City from 22 September to 1

October,

1963, preparing a report on

this electronic

intercept operation. (HMMA-22267, 10/8/63, para. 8.)

This report will be referred to

in some cases in this dis-

cussion of the intercept operation.

The report, however,

was simplified in order

"not to risk losing the reader.

(Memorandum from Chief, WHD, to COS, Mexico City, 12/30/63,

para.

2.)

This simplification was mainly in the

area of

a distinction between reels of tape and transcripts and

in the procedures.

In this

discussion of the

operation other sources will be relied

upon in these areas.

In addition to the telephone surveillance main

tained by the CIA Station in cooperation with the Mexi-

can Government, the Station also maintained some unilateral

surveillance on the Soviets without the knowledge or

cooperation of the Mexican officials.

The unilateral

surveillance was not directed at the

Soviet diplomatic

compound but rather at the private apartments of Soviet

officials in Mexico City®

There was also uni-

lateral coverage of some Cuban targets. (Gôodpasture

Testimony, 4/13/78, pp. 51-52.)

Ann Goodpasture testi

fied that she believed that some of these targets were

located in the Cuban diplomatic compound. (Ibid.)

Ms.

Goodpasture's memory is not borne out by the project

file for the unilateral intercept.

The only Cuban tar-

get of this project was the home of the Cuban Commer-

cial Attache. (HMMA-22536, 11/9/63, para. F.2.)

1245/ After the assassination Headquarters asked Mexico City

not to destroy any of the Soviet tapes from this opera-

tion. (DIR 87770,

12/9/63.)

A note written by Ann Good-

pasture in 1963 seems to confirm Arehart's

assumption

that the tapes were retained at the station.

(The Soviet tap operation) people just keep bring-

ing in the reels to me (the ones I give them are not

labeled so they don't necessarily know which ones

return.) The storage problem is one for us and as

the reels come in with transcriptions, I store them.

When we can erase them, I'll take off

the labels

and send them back out.

In September 2741963, at 19542 Cold

the following call occured. A woman named Silvia is

named Guillermo Ruiz.

Ruiz tells her that he has not

yet been able to reach the consul and because of that

he has not called her.

Silvia tells him that "we"

have no time for that

and asks him for the Consul's

phone number.

Ruiz responds by asking her not to get

annoyed and he wants to know if Silvia wishes to speak

to the Consul personally.

Silvia responds that she

does.

Ruiz says that the number is 11-28-47.

Silvia

says

that is fine and the conversation ends. (CIA

transcript from Cuban Embassy,

9/27/63.4

It cannot be

determined whether this caller was indeed Silvia Duran or

if she subsequently called the Consul since Duran's of-

fice phone was not tapped. The tap was on the telephone

used by Ruiz.

portant to distinguish between the allegation that a

photograph was found at headquarters as opposed to the

assertion that a photograph was found in Mexico City.

It is also important to

remember that these allegations

are what can be termed "grapevine stores."

There was

stovies

a photograph found in Mexico City of

man that was

thought possibly

to be Oswald

This photograph and

the circumstances

surrounding it will be dealt with in

a subsequent section.

Ms. Anne Goodpasture of the

Mexico City Station found this photograph.

(See below.)

at she alienation can see test city in the

mid-60's; not that it was found there--it is most

Iikely that the grapevine stories about a photo being

found in Mexico arise from Ms. Goodpasture's report-

ing the photo of the man who has since become known as

the Mexico mystery man in

the same cable that reported

Oswald's visit to the Soviet Embassy.

(See below.)

The findings of this Committee regarding the general

Mexico City surveillance operations are presented

in

Section II, A and B above.

In summary, this Committee

found that there were three photographic surveillance

bases (four cameras)

that may have photographed Lee

Harvey Oswald in

September and October of 1963-

This

was determined from analysis of

project files for these

operations and the testimony of CIA officials.

The CIA under operative legislation has a counterintelli-

The connection of this photo-

graph to Oswald by including the description in the

cable that reported Oswald's contact with the Soviet Em

bassy has created more confusion and controversy than

perhaps any other CIA related issue stemming

from as-

sassination.

Consequently,

this Committee has made an

attempt to determine the circumstances surrounding the

mistaken linkage

of this photograph to Oswald

as the consequences of that mistake.

does not come up in any of the transcripts made available

not given in that transcript.

there is one additional transcript, possibly of the con-

can be deteriined in that they were numbered sequen-

In this regard it should be

noted that this system can indicate the order in which

679/ HSCA staff have wondered whether or not the Mexico

City

Station was entirely forthcoming of their own will

with Headquarters.

This speculation was based on three

pieces of information.

The

first is the report in

In 67770

MEXI 7024 that Headquarters had all the available in-

formation.

The second is a note from Win Scott on the

Routing and Record Sheet for MEXI 7033 which says:

1467132

I had a call from Washington ( John Scelso) at

1620 hours on 23/XI.

I told John Scelso

at

1630 hours (our time) on 23/XI that this would

be on route to him.

The third is a cable reporting that on the 23rd

Scott had an urgent call to see the President of

Mexico.

The cable reports that Scott expected the

President to

express his condolences over the assas-

sination but

"developed that (Mexican agent) had

located call to Soviet Embassy of Lee Oswald

made on 28 September.

Believe fact that (President

of Mexico) aware of

this contact (from our joint

operation) and passed data to COS is important."

67105 - (MEXI 7023, 11/23/63, paras. 2 and 3)

The Committee declines to

speculate that the Mexico City

Station was possibly considering not reporting

the information available to them.

It was considered

that this may have been contemplated in order to pro-

tect

themselves from a charge about their

failure

to

report the information prior

to

the assassination.

The discovery that the Mexicans were also aware of

the conversations would have made holding back the

transcripts perilous in that the Mexicans could have

revealed their existence to the detriment of the

Station.

Hence, the full report followed very shortly

after the meeting between the Mexican President and

Win Scott, and immediately after

Scott discussed the

situation

with his nominal superior in Washington

by telephone.

Scott's superior was asked about this.

He said that he did not remember the substance of

his telephone call to win Scott on the 23I0°"I do

Deposition of John Scelso, 5/16/78, p. 88)

not have any idea why (I called).

I may have been

ordered to call him on any number of things." (Ibid.,

p. 87.)

He was also asked

about Scott's meeting

with the Mexican President.

is called in to speak to the Presi-

dent of Mexico.

There had been a big fight

when the new Ambassador got there-no, it wasn't

It was a very peculiar situation in Mexi-

co whereby the Mexican President's primary con-

tact with the U.S. government was through our

Chief of Station rather than through the Ambas-

This caused no great problem with the

then-Ambassador whose name I have forgotten.

Q: Thomas Mann?

A: Yes.

He was a very fine guy and recognized

the usefulness of this arrangement.

The next

Ambassador, Mr. Freeman, tried to cut Win

Scott out of contact with the President of

Mexico, whereupon the President of Mexico

called in Win Scott and said, "I want you to

send a cable to the White House telling them

I am not going to deal with this jackass, I

want to deal only with you."

So, the result was, eventually, Winston

Scott and Ambassador Freeman went to the

White House and talked to President Johnson

and straightened the whole thing out in favor

of winston Scott.

So, Scott is just remarking that it is

A: Yes.

Win Scott indicated that he was going to write a memoran-

(Routing and Record Shilet for MEXI 7028, 11/23/63.)

If Mr. Scott wrote such a memo, it has not been made

available to the HSCA. David Phillips, who after serv-

ing in Mexico, went on to accumulate quite an impres-

sive record as a Chief of Station in several countries

himself, told Committee investigators that a memoran-

dum of this sort,

along with other "sensitive" informa-

tion would be the type of thing that Win Scott probably

kept in his private safe.

(David A. Phillips

Mr.

Phillips

added that he did not

know what happened to Mr. Scott's safe after he died

but he had heard vague stories

about someone

finding

a lot of documents that Scott had kept. (Ibid.)
