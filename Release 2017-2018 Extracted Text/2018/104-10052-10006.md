In addition to the telephone surveillance main-
tained by the CIA Station in cooperation with the Mexi-
can Government, the Station also maintained some unilateral
surveillance on the Soviets without the knowledge or
cooperation of the Mexican officials. The unilateral
surveillance was not directed at the Soviet diplomatic
compound but rather at the private apartments of Soviet
officials in Mexico City. (Goodpasture Testimony,
4/13/78, p. 56; Manell Interview, 3/20/78, p. 7; HSCA
Deposition of H. Manell, 4/28/78, p. 7; HSCA Deposition
of B. Manell, 4/28/78, pp. 16-17.) There was also uni-
lateral coverage of some Cuban targets. (Gdodpasture
Testimony, 4/13/78, pp. 51-52.) Ann Goodpasture testi-
fied that she believed that some of these targets were
located in the Cuban diplomatic compound. (Ibid.) Ms.
Goodpasture's memory is not borne out by the project
file for the unilateral intercept. The. only Cuban tar-
get of this project was the home of the Cuban Commer-
cial Attache. (HMMA-22536, 11/9/63, para. F.2.)

/245/ After the assassination Headquarters asked. Mexico City
not to destroy any of the Soviet tapes from this opera-
tion. (DIR 87770, 12/9/63) A note written by Ann Good-
pasture in 1963 seems to confirm Arehart's assumption
that the tapes were retained at the station.

(The Soviet tap operation) people just keep bring-
ing in the reels to me (the ones I give them are not
labeled so they don't necessarily know which ones
return.) The storage problem is one for us and as
the reels come in with transcriptions, I store them.
When we can erase them, I'll take off the labels
and send them back out.

(Note. by Ann Goodpasturé, 12/10/63, attached to DIR 87770,
12/9/63. Second parenthetical in original.)

246/ Zambernardi Interview, 6/3/78, p. 5.

247/ Emphasis added. Mr. Arehart was absolutely positive that
Cuban tapes were retained for thirty days because he

maintained them in the special rack. (Arehart Interview,
6/2/78, p. 3.) Hence, the two week “usual practice” is
probably not correct insofar as the Cuban tapes are con-
cerned.

the following call occured.. A woman named Silvia \s
named Guillermo Ruiz. Ruiz tells her that he has not
yet been able to reach the consul and because of that
he has not called her. Silvia tells him that "we"
have no time for that and asks him for the Consul's
phone number. Ruiz responds by asking her not to get
annoyed and he wants to know if Silvia wishes to speak
to the Consul personally. Silvia responds that she
does. Ruiz says that the number is 11-28-47. Silvia
says that is fine and the conversation ends. (CIA
transcript from Cuban Embassy, 9/27/63.) It cannot be
determined whether this caller was indeed Silvia Duran or
if she subsequently called the Consul since Duran's of-
fice phone was not tapped. The tap was on the telephone
used by Ruiz.

444/ In considering the above detailed allegations, it is im-
portant to distinguish between the allegation that a
photograph was. found at headquarters as opposed to the
assertion that a photograph was found in Mexico City.
It is also important to remember that these allegations
are what can be termed "grapevine stores." There was shows
a photograph found in Mexico City of a man that was
thought possibly to be Oswald. - This photograph and
the circumstances surrounding it will be dealt with in
a subsequent section. Ms. Anné Goodpasture of the
Mexico City Station found this photograph. (See below.
In the absence of any evidence otherwise--Note:,.The,
Watson allegation says there was a photo‘in Mexico’ City in the
mid-60's; not that it was found there--it is most
likely that the grapevine stories about a photo being
found in Mexico arise from Ms. Goodpasture's report~
ing the photo of the man who has since become known as
the Mexico mystery man in the same cable that reported
Oswald's visit to the Soviet Embassy. (See below.)

The findings of this Committee regarding the general
Mexico City surveillance operations are presented in
Section II, A and B above. In summary, this Committee
found that there were three photographic surveillance
bases (four cameras) that may have photographed Lee
Harvey Oswald in September and October of 1963. This
was determined from analysis of project files for these
operations and the testimony of CIA officials. (See

’ preceding sections.)

In addressing this question, the HSCA staff reviewed all
the cable and dispatch traffic between Mexico City and
Headquarters for the period from October 1, 1963 to
26 November 1963 in an attempt to determine whether Os-
wald's photo may have been sent to Headquarters. This
examination also revealed no evidence that.a photograph
of Oswald was sent to CIA Headquarters. This Committee
did find that there were several types of communications
between Headquarters and field stations that were treated
as non-record material. Because of the non-record nature
of these communications, it was not possible to review
that. material.

or any liaison agreement with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation that may have been in existence in 1963.
(Letter to Breckinridge, 7/20/78.) The CIA responded
"that there are not now, nor were there any, agreements
between the CIA and FBEzor other U.S. government agen-
cies concerning CIA responsibility to report on contacts
of U.S. cutizens with Communist Embassies or officials
The CIA under operative legislation has a counterintel.
gence responsibility for counterintelligence cases
but it is notamatter of agreement with other agencies nor
does it concern simple contacts of Americans abroad with
Communist Embassies or officials." (Memorandum to

bassy has created more confusion and controversy than
perhaps any other CIA related issue stemming from as-

mistaken linkage of this photograph to Oswald as well
as the consequences of that mistake. The consequences

"gave his name very slowly and distinctly." (Foul Foe
Manuscript, p. 267.) If Oswald used his middle name at
that time it would explain why Scott wrote "sic." by
“Henry." But it should be noted that Oswald's name
does not come up in any of the transcripts made available
by the CIA until 10/1/63, and Oswald'smiddle name is
not given in that transcript. It is possible that
there is one additional transcript, possibly of the con-
versation that Scott, on page 267 of his manuscript,
refers to as Oswald's “first contact," which, if in exis-
tence, has not been made available to this Committee.

679/ HSCA staff have wondered whether.or not the Mexico City
Station was entirely forthcoming of their own will
with Headquarters. This speculation was based on three
pieces of information. The first is the report in

ovo MEXI 7024 that Headquarters had all the available in-
we formation. The second is a note from Win Scott on the

Routing and Record Sheet for MEXI 7033 which says:

i

;

I had a call from Washington ( John Scelso) at
1620: hours on 23/xI. I told John Scelso at
1630 hours (our time) on .23/XI that this would
be on route to him.

The third is a cable reporting that on the 23rd Win
Scott had an urgent call to see the President of
Mexico. The cable reports that. Scott expected the
President to express his condolences over the assas-
sination but "developed that (Mexican agent) had
located call to Soviet Embassy of Lee Oswald

made on 28 September. Believe fact that (President
of Mexico) aware of this contact (from our joint
operation) and passed data to COS is important."
-(MEXI 7023, 11/23/63, paras. 2 and 3)

caves

The Committee declines to speculate that the Mexico City
Station was possibly considering not reporting all

the information available tothem. It was considered
that this may have been contemplated in order to pro-
tect themselves from a charge about their failure to
report the information prior to the assassination.

The discovery that the Mexicans were also aware of
the conversations would have made holding back the
transcripts perilous in that the Mexicans could have
revealed their existence to the detriment of the
Station. Hence, the full report followed very shortly
after the meeting between the Mexican President and
Win Scott, and immediately after Scott discussed the
situation with his nominal superior in Washington

by telephone. Scott's superior was asked about this.
He said that he did not remember the substance of
his telephone call to Win Scott on the 23rd. (HSCA
Deposition of John Scelso, 5/16/78, p. 88) "I do
not have any idea why (I called). I may have been
ordered to call him on any number of things (Ibid.,
Pp. 87.) He was also asked about Scott's meeting
with the Mexican President.

You get a psychological question. ‘The Chief

of Station is called in to speak to the Presi-
dent of Mexico. There had been a big fight
when the new Ambassador got there--no, it wasn't
that. It was a very peculiar situation in Mexi-
co whereby the Mexican President's primary con-
tact with the U.S. government was through our
Chief of Station rather than through the Ambas-
sadors. This caused no great problem with the
then-Ambassador whose name I have forgotten.

Q: Thomas Mann?

A: Yes. He was a very fine guy and recognized
the usefulness of this arrangement. The next
Ambassador, Mr. Freeman, tried to cut Win
Scott out of contact with the President of
Mexico, whereupon the President of Mexico
called in Win Scott and said, "I want you to
send a cable to the White House telling them
I am not going to deal with this jackass, I
want to deal only with you."

*So, ‘the result was, eventually, Winston

Scott and Ambassador Freeman went to the
White House and talked to President Johnson
and straightened the whole thing out in favor
of Winston Scott.

So, Scott is just remarking that it is
interesting that the President of Mexico is
aware of our telephone operation.

Q: He should have been since it was a liaison
operation.

A: Yes. But you do not always know whether he
was informed. I think we always knew he was
informed. I think we always knew he was in-
formed. It is just significant that the per-
son calls you in and says, here is some intel-
ligence about the Kennedy thing.

(HSCA Deposition of John Scelso, 5/16/78, pp. 83-84.)

Win Scott indicated that he was going to write a memoran-
dum concerning his meeting with the President of Mexi-
wat — 0. (Routing and Record Shfet for MEXI 7028, 11/23/63.)
G If Mr. Scott wrote such a memo, it has not been made
available to the HSCA. David Phillips, who after serv-
ing in Mexico, went on to accumulate quite an impres-
sive record as a Chief of Station in several countries
himself, told Committee investigators that a memoran-
dum of this sort, along with other "sensitive" informa-
tion would be the type of thing that Win Scott probably
kept in his private safe. (David A. Phillips Interview,
8/24/78, p. 10.) Mr. Phillips added that he did not
know what happened to Mr. Scott's safe after he died
but he had heard vague stories about someone finding
a lot of pee that Scott had kept. (Ibid.)
