F. DATE DESIGNATED AS INFORMANT

11/30/71

G. ESTIMATE OF RELIABILITY

There has been insufficient contact with the informant

to determine reliability. Nothing has been developed, however,

to indicate that the informant has furnished other than reliable

information.

H. EMPLOYMENT

The source is not employed at this time. He has talked

with persons at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), 1520

New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., who have stated

that he is being considered for a job at IPS. These persons are

MARCUS RASKIN and ARTHUR IRWIN WASKOW. IPS, RASKIN and WASKOW

are subjects of WEO files set forth later in this communication.

The source has been employed in the past as a hospital

and medical insurance company clerical employee.

I. PAST ACTIVITIES®

The source has in the past furnished information. to

the Metropolitan Police Department (Intelligence Division and

. Second District), Washington, D.G., and the Alcohol, Tobacco

and Firearms Division of the. Internal Revenue Service.

The source has been in the Washington, D.C. area,

primarily in the vicinity of Dupont Circle, for more than six

years.

During the Spring, 1971, the source became associated

with JOHN RANKIN DAVIS (WF 100-48582) and others associated with

the planning of the May, 1971, demonstrations in Washington, D.C.

Following his association with these persons, the source began

to take part in activities held at IPS and to become acquainted

With persons at IPS such as RASKIN, WASKOW and JOANN MALONE.

WFO 137-5692

The source advised that he has never been arrested

although he has been detained by law enforcement personnel on

several occasions. A search of the files of the Metropolitan

Police Department and U.S. Park Police disclosed no record

identifiable with the source under his true name or any of his

aliases. A check of NCIC reflected no warrants for the source

under his true name or aliases.

A review of WFO indices reflects that the source was

the subject of WF 87-18178. Under the name JAMES R. MONROE,

the source had, during May, 1970, cashed three checks totalling

$225.00 at Charleston, West Virginia, on a bank in Washington,

D.C. The checks were returned to the Charleston Bank. Prosecu-

tion in this matter was declined on 2/23/71, by AUSA ROBERT B.

KING, Southern District of West Virginia, because the amount

of money involved and evidence available did not justify further

investigative efforts to locate and interview MERRITT.

The source explained that he had at one time cashed

several checks amounting to a little over $200 while he visited

Charleston, West Virginia, during the Spring, 1970. He stated

that he has made efforts to negotiate payment of these checks

and that he has at no other time and will never again engage

in this practice.

J. IDENTIFICATION RECORD

A request for an Identification Record was made on

11/8/71. No criminal or civil file identifiable with the source

under his true name or aliases was located.

K. CRIMINAL ASSOCIATES

The source is in regular contact with a number of

persons engaged in criminal activity. He is an admitted homo-

sexual and this has brought him into contact with other homo-

sexuals who engage in various types of criminal activities. The

source has in the past furnished information concerning persons

involved in a homicide, narcotics, armed robberies, burglaries

and other crimes to the Metropolitan Police Department.

L. INFORMATION FURNISHED IN THE PAST

The source has furnished information regarding the

captioned cases set forth below:

Institute for Policy Studies (IPS)

IS-NEW LEFT

(00: WFO)

(Bufile 100-447935)

(WFOfile 100-46784)

IPS is located at 1520 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W.,

Washington, D.C.

The source has furnished information concerning IPS

on a continuing basis. On 10/5/71, the source advised that he

had attended a meeting regarding prisons held at IPS on 9/21/71.

This meeting was dominated by ARTHUR. IRWIN WASKOW and JOANN

MALONE. These two persons are the subjects of WrO file

105-50397 (Bufile 105-114241), captioned "ARTHUR IRWIN WASKOW,

SM-NEW LEFT" and WFO file 100-49419 (Bufile 454221), captioned

"JOANN MALONE, SM-NEW LEFT." The source also furnished infor-

mation on 10/6/71 concerning another meeting involving the

prison issue held at IPS on 10/5/71. This meeting, too,

was

dominated by WASKOW and MALONE.

On 10/13/71, the source advised that sometime during

September, 1971, MALONE had discussed the subject of FBI

surveillance of IPS with him. She told the source that she

and others at IPS believed the FBI was watching them from a

building across the street, from a room in the Dupont Plaza

Hotel (to the right of the IPS building) and possibly from the

building on the other side of the IPS building. It was further

believed that the IPS building was "bugged" and that the FBI

was using sophisticated electronic equipment to pick up con-

versations in and around IPS. Because of these suspicions,

-5 -

persons associated with IPS discuss important matters outside

the building.

The source provided a description on 10/13/71 of that

part of the IPS building with which he is familiar.

On 10/20/71, the source advised that WASKOW had talked

with him about the possibility of working for IPS or persons

associated with IPS. WASKOW was not specific about the job

and during subsequent contacts the source advised that he was

having difficulty locating WASKOW at IPS and that when he did

talk with him WASKOW was still noncommittal concerning the

job.

On 11/16/71, the source advised that he had spoken

with MARCUS RASKIN at IPS. RASKIN is the subject of WE 100-45298

(Bufile 100-454040) captioned "MARCUS GOODMAN RASKIN, SM-NEW

LEFT." RASKIN told the source on 11/15/71 that the source was

being considered for a job which would involve assisting WASKOW

and others at IPS. RASKIN said that further thought was being

given this possibility and that the source should return to see

him at 1:00 p.M., 11/23/71.

On 11/9/71, the source advised that MALONE had commented

upon the apathy toward the prison issue and the fact that a

meeting would be held on the evening of 11/11/71 to renew

interest in the issue.

On 11/10/71, the source stated that

MALONE had again expressed her concern concerning lack of interest

in the prison issue and had set forth her ideas as to what

course of action should be undertaken to better publicize and

renew interest in the issue. MALONE said that she was disappointed

in the response of the black community to the prison issue.

Although the source has not observed nor heard anything of

SPIEGEL, it is believed that the fact that the source is

occasionally in the IPS building will enable him to be in an

advantageous position to observe SPIEGEL or any other of the

New Left fugitives should they make contact with persons at

IPS.

investigation in this matter.

On 11/3/71, the source advised that JERRY DUNLAP had

told him that MIKE (LNU), the NYA member working at the

Columbia Plaza Apartments, had been talking of planning the kid-

napping of the woman who was to be appointed to a high position

in the U.S. Treasury. The name of this woman was not mentioned.

This kidnapping was to be carried out at the Columbia Plaza

Apartments.

It was subsequently determined that Mrs. ROMONA

BANUELOS had gone to the Columbia Plaza Apartments to inquire

• about an apartment during late September, 1971. Mrs. BANUELOS

The information furnished by the source regarding

IPS and persons associated with IPS has been of value as intelligence

data. The source is one of only a few sources in a position to

furnish information concerning IPS which is described as the

"think tank" of the New Left.

Information regarding Dr. WILLIAM PIERCE and HAMILTON

MICHAEL BARRETT is of value from an intelligence standpoint

and has substantially aided the ATFD in its investigation of

possible firearms and explosives violations on the part of these

persons.

The source spends much time in many areas of Washington,

D.C., particularly Dupont Circle, and this enables him to be

observant concerning fugitives and for the matters of interest

to the Bureau. The fact that he is a homosexual permits him

to furnish information of value to the Bureau concerning.

persons in the homosexual community, and enable WrO to fulfill

its responsibilities for identifying homosexuals in government.

M. EMOTIONAL STABILITY

During contacts with this informant the informant has

exhibited no traits of emotional instability or unreliability,

nor is it known that the informant has furnished any false infor-

mation.

on 11-22-71, the source advised that he had met

an acquaintance of his named ALEXIS KING at the Fairfax

Restaurant, 2100 block of P Street; N. W., WDC, on 11-21-71.

This man offered to sell the source six $20.00 bills, described

as counterfeit by KING, for $100.00.

KING said he had nore

of these bills if the source was

interested.

The source

told KING that he was not interested but recalled that the

first four numbers of each serial number on the bills were

"5152."

The source also advised that he had seen KING

involved in a numbers transaction and that he gathered

from KING that KING was still dealing in numbers.

The information concerning the counterfeit bills

was furnished to SA STEPHEN A. LORD, Washington Field Office,

U. S. Secret Service (USSS).

SA LORD advised that he

considered the information very reliable and valuable in

that three $20.00 counterfeit bills with serial numbers

beginning "5152" had been received very recently by the

USSS. He stated that it is unusual to get information

concerning persons passing such bills before counterfeit

bills are received by the USSS and investigation to trace

then is instituted.

Based on the information regarding KING's involve-

ment in numbers transactions, the above-captioned 182 case

On 1/11/72, the source advised that he had visited.

DAVIS at his place of employment and discussed DAVIS'

recent

•activities and a mutual acquaintance.

On 1/14/72, the source advised that he had again

visited DAVIS at his

place of employment and

subsequently

furnished information regarding DAVIS' attitude to the New

Left movement.

On 1/24/72, the source advised that he had talked

with DAVIS on 1/22/72, and that DAVIS had discussed the

possibility of having the source live with him.: He told the

source that he had become much less interested in New Left

activities and was primarily interested in "gay" issues

(DAVIS is a homosexual, according to WF 4015-Cland other

sources).

On 1/27/72, the source advised that DAVIS had told

him that he was staying in a residence near Dupont Circle,

Northwest, Washington, D.C., and was anxious to find a new

permanent residence.

On 2/2/72, the source advised that he was visited

by DAVIS during the early morning hours of 2/2/72. During

the visit, DAVIS told the source about his association with

the Weathermen and particularly that he knew MIKE SPIEGEL

and CATHY WILKERSON, both WEATHFUG subjects, when they lived

in Washington, D.C. before they became fugitives. DAVIS

at first referred to SPIEGEL as MIKE BRADFORD, which may

be an alias being used by SPIEGEL.

It should be noted that WFO is attempting to

obtain information concerning DAVIS' activities, acquaint-

ances, and attitudes; as well as knowledge he might have

concerning CAPBOM or the WEATHrUG subjects. Placing the •

informant in a position where DAVIS will trust him so that

such information can be obtained is a gradual process and

Wro takes this fact into consideration in paying this source.

On 12/8/71, the source advised that he had been

at IPS on 12/7/71, and a person there told him that ARTHUR

WASKOW and others associated with IPS were in a conference

with an individual named WALL (ph). WALL was not further

identified, but was possibly identical with ROBERT WALL, a

former Special Agent of the FBI who was reported to have

visited and talked with persons associated with IPS.

The source had been promised a job at IPS as

ARTHUR WASKOW's assistant. It is noted that among other

activities, WASKOW had in the past been acquainted with two

WEATHrUG subjects, MIKE SPIEGEL and CATHY WILKERSON.

On 12/16/71, the source advised that he talked

with HASKOW on the same date and was told that he was to

On 12/20/71, WASKOW explained the nature of the

job the source was to have and asked the source what his

reaction to police pressure would be.

On 12/27/71, the source talked with WASKOW, who

said that despite a letter from IPS which the source

• had

received to the contrary, the source was still being

considered for the job at IPS. WASKOW stated that he had

"sources" who had indicated that IPS was being infiltrated

by law enforcement agencies and

that

strict screening

procedures, possibly including polygraph tests, were being

adopted regarding new employees and those already associated

with IPS.

vidual reiterated IPS' new screening procedures which were

being adopted to prevent

On 1/27/72, the source was interviewed for three

hours by an attorney for IPS, and RICHARD BARNETT, subject

of WFO 100-45302, Director of IPS, as a part of the screening

program for employment at IPS. He was told that the screening

procedures had been adopted as a result of revelations made

to IPS by a former FBI Agent named ROBERT WALI; who told

them of law enforcement attempts to obtain information

concerning IPS.

individual had been involved in the bombing of the U.S.

Capitol, 3/1/71. The attorney, RAY TWCHIG, told JAVIS

that he would talk to this unnamed individual for DAVIS to

determine whether this person had actually been involved

in

the bombing. The source had been making an effort to

recall as best he could what had been said during this

conversation and reported it only when he was sure that he

recalled enough for the information to be of value.

with the FBI. Davis also told the source that he intended

to travel to New York City after work that night to visit

"Weather fugitives" and other unnamed persons.

POLICE request,

Merritt said, he supplied

telephone numbers and

floor plans for these offices.

"I thought at the time it was

a check on whether I was

going to the places they

asked me to," he said. Mer-

ritt did not know how police

may have,used this infor

mation, he said

During the demonstra-

tion, Merrit continued, he

telephoned reports to police

up to 16 times a day and

joined with some law en-

forcement offices in at-

tempts to disrupt activities.

These included spreading

false information about

meeting times and places

and sabotaging one of the

public address

systems, he said.

After May Day 1971, Mer-

ritt said, police asked him

to concentrate on informa-

tion gained by using an ali-

as to solicit mail from about

200 groups. He said he re-

ceived materials which de-

scribed the programs of the

groups and he turned it over

to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt

said, he was fired by police

because "they said they did

not have enough money to

keep me on a full-time ba-

sis." He said he had been

receiving $50 a week and

expenses. His contacts in-

troduced him to two FBI

agents in the Washington

field office for whom he

subsequently went to work,

BY MERRITT'S account,

his FBI assignments be-

tween October 1971 and

May 1972 centered on the

Institute for Policy Studies.

The FBI wanted him to get

a job there and supply them

with the names and license

tag numbers of persons at

institute meetings, he said

Merritt said

one of the

lists he supplied was from a

meeting on prison abolition

at which a civil rights law-

yer, Philip J. Hirschkop,

spoke. He said he followed

Hirschkop after one of the

meetings at FBI request

and reported the lawyer's

movements and contacts.

Merritt said he worked

for the FBI until May 1972,

a month after his mother

died. He said

"really put me down" and,.

He said his FBI contaçts

reacted by "telling me they

had too much time and

money invested

. that I

had become familiar with

the political community and

I was trained the way they

wanted-One of them told

me to use the work as a way

to get my mind off my moth-'

er's death.

IN MAY, however, he de-

a false re-

port as the last step in

pattern that had begun four

months earlier of giving as

little information to his con-

tacts as he could, Merritt

said. It worked, he said, and

Merritt said one of the

agents warned him against

speaking out by saying,

"We'd sure hate to have

someone find you in the

Potomac wearing cement

galoshas." He was also told

he had been doing "national

security-type work," the

disclosure of which would

be improper, he said

Merritt said that when the

around, his former police

contacts reappeared. He

decided then to get legal

help in his effort to end as-

sociation with law enforce-

ment agencies and contact-

ed Washington lawyer Da-

vid Isbell, he said.

Merritt said a second

threat came from one of his

police contacts when the

contact learned Merritt was

considering public disclo-

sure as a means of keeping

police away from him.

said the officer told him, "If

you try to badmouth us or

any other agencies, you'll

really meet your maker."

ACCORDING to the rec-

ords Merritt kept and dis-

played of his associations

and assignments, the last

threat came in July 1973. He

did not know how his former

contact had learned of his

plan and has had no direct

contact with police since, he

_said.

said he

had been recruited in April

1971 the day after he had

• lost a job. He disputed the

private

assessments

of

•some police sources who

said he had been fired "be-

cause he didn't produce"

and was angry at those who

had let him go.

"My con-

tacts told me my work was

good," Merritt said.

Ann Kolego was describ

ed by police officials as a

police buff "who was ex-

tremely. good" in supplying

information on the activities

of antiwar and other protest

groups.

"She had to be to stay

under cover for so

long

without being burned," one

official said.

According to her former

roommate, Carol Callum,

Miss Kolego was known as

"Crazy Annie" to the activ-

ists and posed as a dropout

from George Washington

. University with a huge infe-

riority complex and willing-

ness to do the menial jobs of

the protest movement-

stuffing envelopes, handing

• out pamphlets and running

errands.

MISS CULLUM said she

first remembered Miss Ko-

lego during the May Day

1971 protest.

Between then

and now, she said, Miss

Kolego was a regular part

of the Washington Peace

Action Coalition, the Peo-

ple's Coalition for Peace

and Justice,

the Anti War

Union, and the Miami Con-

vention Coalition.

According to Miss Cul-

lum, Miss Kolego was "al-

ways around"' and rarely

had to be invited to a meet-

"She was always there

Miss Cullum said.

• Miss Cullum said she con-

fronted Miss Kolego at a

luncheon late last month

after learning Miss Kole-

go's real job.

At the lunch, Miss Cullum

said Miss Kolego apologized

for having used their friend-

ship bur said it was her job.

Miss Cullum 'attributed

disclosure of Miss Kolegù's

identity to the underground

newspaper The Daily Rag

and the Committee for.

telligence Community - a

local group studying how

police and other govern-

called

Herington and said that Merritt had furnished the paper information concerning!

his prior informant status, claiming to have been a paid FBI informant from

N.

October, 1971, until May, 1972, at which time he was discontinued because he

furnished us false information about Jack Davis. He claimed his assigned task

was to monitor the Institute for Policy Studies, 1520 New Hampshire S'reet,

ExcisioN, Northwest, Washington, D. C., and to keep an eye on Jack Davis, who was

DELETE

associated with the Institute. He said that he had been a police department

DENTiTY informant prior to working for the FBI and

said that this had been con-

firmed by the police. Merritt said that he had been handled by Washington

INDIVIDUAl Field Office Agents William Tucker and Terry O'Connor, and that when he

Protectedwas discontinued in May, 1972, Tucker had threatened him by saying,

would hate to have someone find you in the Potomac with cement galoshes. "

He also alleged that Tucker threatened to have him prosecuted on three old bad

EMployer check charges in which Merritt was involved.

Herington told

that he would have to get back in touch with

him later.

Bureau files reveal that Merritt was a criminal informant

from late 1971 until he was discontinued by Washington Field

letter dated 6/8/72. He was targeted against the Institute for Policy Studies

and Jack Davis mainly because Davis was considered a Weatherman fugitive

support person and because we had information that some of the Weatherman

fugitives had visited the Institute. Merritt also furnished other valuable

criminal information. Merritt is a homosexual and was determined to be

unreliable, at which point he was discontinued. Although he has not been

identified by name, we believe he is responsible for allegations which resulted

in the attorney for the Institute for Policy Studies claiming the FBI and the

Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) were engaged in illegal surveillance

rights investigation on these allegations in August, 1973, and the results hares

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Department. Agents who

handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to

him.

Herington called

back today and told him that as a matter of

policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential

information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this

time that we could say about Merritt's allegations.

said that he under-

stord and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt

claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to

the FBI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not

terribly sophisticated in its handirg of informants. He said also that he knew

that Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really reliable.

Some of his allegations have not checked out at all in further inquiry by

Herington also pointed out to

that neither/the allegations alleging threats

against Merritt could be interpreted as threats even if the statements had been

made. He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing

themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-

tion against them for having helped the FBI.

The statement that we would nate

to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing

that would be an admonishment against his self-disclosure becauses ome of

his friends might seek revenge.

Herington told

that it was ridiculous

to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was

also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on

checks, this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since

it was obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might

• cause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

said that he took everything Merritt said with a grain of salt.

of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says

• he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in

our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he

•sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants

but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He

said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBI and indicated

that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.

In addition to monitoring

Merritt voiced

that he was not education-

In the meantime, Merritt

was "terminated" by the po-

of dramatic antivar street

demonstrations had subsided

the intelligence division was

running out of money to

pay informants).

With the recommendation

of his police superiors,

ton field office of the FBI at

$50 to $75 a week and con-

tinued his work at the IPS.

He was by this time so

disillusioned with the law

he said, that he was deliber-

ately cutting down on the

amount of information he

reported. He said he main-

tained the guise of the in-

former, however, because "I

needed the money" and be-

of the allegations made by Merritt.

Martin said he understood the CPD had received

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re :

Unknown Subjects; Marcus Raskin and

the Institute for Policy Studiés-Victims

provided directly to the WSPF by Merritt who he said was

publicly identified as a former informant for the FBI.

Martin said he was aware of the. FD-302's prepared by SAs

Tucker and O'Connor relative to their knowledge of Merritt's

activities as an informant and that he did not feel these

FD-302's covered the current allegations.

At this point, martin was asked point blank what

these "new allegations"

letter had perhaps been a mistake as it was quite 'strong," but

that the new information centered around a claim made by Merritt

that the FBI had received stolen mail from Merritt knowing

it to be: stolen.

In this regard, Merritt claims that he took

mail from the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), Washington,

D. C.,

turned it over to one of the two ITC Agents, who later

returned it to Merritt with instructions to return it to the

IPS office.

Martin stated Merritt had furnished WSPF with

additional information and allegations concerning the FBI but

that after looking into Merritt's background and considering

the

information, that he, Martin, did not feel that this

additional information had any merit whatsoever. He said he

could not, however, permit the charge

of receiving stolen mail

to "lay in his files," and that it was for this reason he

desired to interview SAs O'Connor and Tucker.

It was then pointed out to Martin that FD-302 dated

6/28/73, prepared by SAs Tucker and O'Connor noted receipt

from merritt on one occasion of an envelope containing some

material which herritt explained had cone from the trash at

IPS.

Although the Agents did not closely examine all of the

material, It did appear to be trash. No inventory was made of

all the items and the material was returned to Merritt as soor

as he could again be contacted at which time he was told that

2f the material belonged in the trash it IPs, that is where 1t

should be placed. Merritt was also told again as he had betore

that the FBI never wanted him to obtain such materials from the

IPS and that the only other materials provided by Merritt from

IPS were leaflets intended for the public.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

the Institute for Policy Studies-Victims

Martin said he was aware of this FD-302 and its

contents but that he continued to feel the necessity of

interviewing SAs Tucker and O'Connor relative to Merritt's

claim.

He stated, however, that he was not in any rush to

Interview the Agents, since he desired to review the CRD

file in this matter prior to such interview.. At this point

the conversation was terminated.

It should be noted that at one point during the

WSPF investigation of Merritt's

latest allegations) but that

the WSPF did have some standing in the matter since the

Incident "could" have arisen from pressure exerted by The

White House.

PURPOSE :

and March of 1972; that he worked under the direction of

Special Agents Terry O'Conner and William Tucker of WO; and "

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Earl Robert Merritt

it is noted that Merritt was told that the FBI was interested

in information concerning John Rankin Davis, who was then a

suspect in the 3/1/71 bombing of the U.S. Capitol Building

and was also believed by NFO to possibly be in contact with

some of the Weatherman fugitives. Merritt advised the Agents

May of 1971. From January,

reported

conversations he said he had with Davis concerning his Weatherman

an individual Davis said was

and reported on several occasions that Davis had wanted him to

accompany Davis to New York and wanted him to rent an apartment

as a safehouse for fugitives. On 5/30/72 when Merritt claimed

he had talked with Davis in Washington, D. C., Davis was being

interviewed by Bureau Agents at Lake Ariel, Pennsylvania. During

the interview, Davis related having met an individual in

Washington, D. C., known to him as

"Butch" whom he suspected was

an informant. He related

"Butch" on one or two occasions attempted

to persuade him to travel to New York and once talked about

renting an apartment as a

safehouse for fugitives.

After reviewing

the above, WFO felt "Butch" was identical with Merritt, that

doubt had

been cast on his credibility, and therefore, he was

discontinued as an informant.

By teletype 11/20/74, which is attached, Special

Agents O'Conner and Tucker categorically denied Merritt's allegations.

OBSERVATIONS :

Davis was never a target of any Cointelpro, which

program was discontinued 4/28/71, nor was hertargeted against

Davis in any way which can be interpreted as counterintelligence.

On the contrary, it appears Merritt, in reporting on Davis, lied

to WFO Agents regarding Davis in order to obtain money. In a

• "Washington Post" article, 11/26/73, Merritt exposed his role as

i met at tact method an ament and reasons

why he ceased his informant activities. In the article, Merritt

lied about performing illegal acts for the FBI and lied about his

payments. Merritt's present allegations to Orr Kelly that he

carried out tactics like those described in Cointelpro are false,

and this appears to be another attempt by him to obtain notoriety.

RECOMMENDA TION:

That the allegations by Merritt to Orr Kelly be

categorically denied.

Beginning with the conversation on October 1, 1971,

Merritt stated that he spent a great deal of time at the

Institute for folicy Studies (I'5), Hashiagton, D. C. (riC).

He purported to have frce and rightful access to the previses

of IPS it which he perfored odd jobs and attended acetings.

He stated that he had becone accuninted with porsous aù Irs,

expocintly Arthur Waskow, Torous Resin end Joanne Malone,

and visitoo then Excruently at 1i5.

Frevious investigation had reflected an association

linking certain of the Weathernan Fugliives with persons en

ployed at Irs, principally arthur loskor and barcus jaskin.

The association suong those persons had existed before these

Heatheman nembers, particularly ilichael spiegel, Cathlyn

Platt Silkeeson and lillian Ayers, became fugitives. It was

belleved that baving sodeone like

terrict with laskow and

Rassin on a legitimate and sonewhat regular basis might result

in the developpent of infomacion which would lead to the

apprehension of sone of these lugitives.

It might also result

in the developnent of infomation concerning civil distuptions

and other illegal activities.

During the period of October, 1971 to January, 1972,

Kerritt Furnished infornation concerning conversations with

Unshon, lastin and Malone. He actoried rooting at lus and

obtained various parphlets (intended for public dissenination)

would begin after January 1, 1972. Prior to that Gate, Wiskow

Merritt thercaiter reported that he had difficulty in getting in

touch with laskow regarding these sessions. He furnished a

letter from IPS dated December 18, 1971, stating that no new

personnel would be hired at Irs.

Re talked with laskow on

December 27, 1971, and on this occasion laskow told him that ne

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT

1

By form letter dated March 4,

1975, the Office

of the Deputy Attorney General

enclosed a letter which had

been received from Darl Robert Merritt

Merritt has requested that any "investigatory fatasch

maintained by the Bureau relating to him be made available

for his inspection and copying under the Freedom of Infor-

mation Act. A copy of Merritt's letter is attached.

The Bureau was directed by the Deputy Attorney

General to comply with the request or deny it, based upon

the law and existing regulations.

It is noted that in 1970 and 1971, Merritt was the

subject of an interstate transportation of stolen property

investigation in which prosecution was

dectined.

In addition to the ITSP matter, Merritt is a

former Bureau criminal informant, and for this reason,

the

Freedom of Information Act Unit of the Office of Legal

Counsel has requested our comments concerning this request.

On October 1, 1971, Merritt presented himself

I. I Recer to Mr. Cleveland

Re:

Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

After being closed, Merritt disclosed his former

relationship. with the Bureau

to representatives of the media.

He made some untrue statements,

including the allegation that

WTO Agents had threatened his life in an attempt to insure

that he never reveal his role as an informant.

The proper response to Merritt's request is, of

Counsel a matter to be determined by the office of Legal

It would appear, however, that the material in

the informant file is not

'"investigatory" in nature, and

the operation of an informant is not, in and of itseli, an

investigation.

Other than the aforementioned ITSP case, the

only investigation of Merritt which is reflected in the

informant file is a check of appropriate local criminal

agencies when he was opened as a PCI:

Merritt provided information in matters within

our jurisdiction, but these of course do not relate to him

as a subject or suspect, and would notappear to fall within

the scope of his request.

It is further noted that in regard to those

investigations in which he provided Intormation, his

assistance was in the form of an investigative technique,

which we are not required to disclose under Section b(7)

of the Act.

RECOMMENDATION :

Unless the Office of Legal Counsel is of the

opinion that we must furnish material from Merritt's

informant file, it is recommended that by appropriate

communication,

he be advised that the information

contained in that file is being denied him.

pounds of material compiled by larl Robert Merritt for the

combined time he served as

an informant for both the

ficiality of information accumulated by lerritt during

the

late 1960s and early 1970s.

Nerritt clains he was paid

approximately $1,500 by the MPD covering

the period April

In 9/74, Merritt related to a news reporter that

he had carried

out, for the Bureau, tactics described in

the

then recently released colfilleno report,

nearly a

year and

a half after the program was ordered halted. and he

made several allegations of improper conduct on the part of

All of the allegations were vehemently

refuted by involved personnel, and

the news reporter was

furnished full facts concerning the matter. Details con-

cerning this incident were set forth in my menorandum to

you dated 11/21/74, captioned above.

OBSERVATIONS:

The above article appears to be prefaced upon

another attempt by lerritt to obtain notoriety. As the

article contains no allegations against either the Bureau

or its personnel, no additional action is deemed nec-

essary by this Bureau.

RECOMENDATION:

None.

left hand —H: 5-11-W: 175.

This description of author and com-

munity activist Arthur I. Waskow, com-

plete with the misspelling of his last

name,

is part of almost 50

pounds of

assorted

documents and files main-

tained by former FBI and D.C. police

informant Earl Robert Merritt during

the antiwar days of the late 1960s and

• early 1970s.

The files, consisting primarily of an-

tiwar tracts, leaflets, flyers, mailouts,

news clippings and other publicly avail-

able documents, have been described

by both Merritt and his superiors in

the intelligence division of the D.C. po-

lice department as "mostly junk."

Merritt estimates the FBI and D.C.

( police paid him a total of $4,500 in sal-

aries and expenses for his efforts for a

14-month period between April, 1971,

" and June, 1972. Both police and FBI

have verified that he worked for them.

Merritt made cópies of his tiles

available to The Washington Post after

D.C. Police Chief Maurice J. Culli-

nane

issued

report

earlier

this

month acknowledging that the intelli-

gence division collected thousands of

unevaluated

and irrelevant files on

local political figures and organiza-

tions.

The detailed physical description of

Waskow is one of the few independen-

tly developed reports made by Mer-

ritt-written in September, 1971, after

Merritt attended a prison reform meet-

ing chaired by Waskow.

Yet; police acknowledge its value is

virtually nil: it describes a man who

already was well known to the police

and who was a familiar public figure

• in the antiwar and civil rights move.

cal descriptions, including the racial

and ethnic appearance of individuals

Informers Spied on

By Jared Stout and

Toni House

DC. Activist

Districi police intelli-

gence

operatives

were

keeping watch on the city's

antiwar community and

other activists as recently

as June, according to a

former paid informant. The

surveillance began at least

two years ago, the informer

said

Police said reports based

on informers' information

were given regularly to the

I FBI. Some information may

have been passed to the

White House. One informer

said his tactics included

burglary and disruption of

protests.

While police officials con-

firmed the identity and in-

formant assignment of two

persons, one of whom was

interviewed by the-star:

News, they declined to say

how many informants may

be assigned io

keeping

Chief Jerry V. Wilson in-

formed on possible protest

demonstrations.

AMONG

NATIONAL

groups attracting police

attention were the Ameri-

can Academy of Political

Science, the American Civil

Liberties Union, and the

Coalition on National Prior-

itics and Goals, whose mail

solicitations for members

were signed by Sen. William

Proxmire, D-Wis.

Among local groups were

the American Nazi party,

the Black United Front, the

D.C. Statchood party and

the institute

for Policy

Studies, a "shink tank"' on

radical alternatives to U.S.

foreign and domestic policy,

which is located at 1520 Ncw

Ann Kolego, 20; have been

police intelligence imorm-

ants, but they and the FBI

would not give details of the

undercover work.

Merritt and Miss Kolego's

former roommates describ-

ed the activities in inter-

views.

Merritt, who went from

work with the police to work

with the FBI, is a Charles-

son, V. Va., man who came

to Washington in January

1963 and works as a drug

company cashier.

Miss Kolego grew up in

the Washington area and,

until recently, was a wait-

ress in a Connecticut Ave-

nue restaurant.. She began

police

recruit training

Wednesday.

MERRITT SAID he de-

cided to disclose his under-

cover role after other ef

forts to break off the work

failed. after his abartment

was ransacked three times

recently and after he was

threatened wice by offi-

cials.

He said he did not know

how groups or persons were

selected for police atten-

tion.

Police intelligence offi-

cials described their job as

one of keeping "the chief of

police informed of potential

problems and disorders

which might occur in the

ost and require

police action

The official said the de-

partment has no written

guidelines for intelligence

surveillance. One official

said, "It's really left up to

the intelligence division."

Merritt said a sergeant in

police intelligence suggest-

ed two break-ins after May

Day 1971. One of them at the

Community Bookstore, 2028

P SL NV, was completed

The other. Merritt'said, was

at The 5th Street office of the

Goergetown University le-

gal interns. It was called

off.

MERRITT

SAID he

gained entry to the book-

store after closing hours by

taping open the

lock on a

foyer door. He took antiwar

petitions, pamphlets, meet-

ing notices. and other mate-

rials and give them to police

contacts who told him they

would be a source of names

of persons and groups in the

protest community, Merritt

According to Merritt,

stealing the petitions was

one means his contacts used

to disrupt the petitioning

part of the protests.

There was no police re-

port of the break-in at the

bookstore, which features

the writings of revolution

ary theorists and practition-

eis. But persons at the shop

recall such an incident in

late May 1971 and said no

one attached any signifi-

cance to it at the time.

Before and after the big

May Day 1971 antiwar pro-

test, Merritt said, he visited

the offices used by groups

largely responsible for the

protest: the People's Coali-

tion on Peace and Justice,

Vietnam Veterans Against

the War, and the Lanier

Place residence used by

some demonstration plan-

AT POLICE request,

Merritt said, he supplied

relephone numbers

and

•floor plans for these offices.

"I thought at the time it was

à check on whether 1 was

going to the places they

asked me to," he said. Mer-

ritt did not know how police

may have used this infor

mation, he said

During tie demonstra-

tion, Merrit contthued, he

telephoned reports to police

up to 16 times a day and

joined with some law en-

forcement offices in at-

tempts to disrupt activities.

These included spreading

false information .about

meeting times and places

and sabotaging one of the

public address

systems, he said.

After May Day 1971, Mer-

ritt said, police asked him

to concentrate on informa-

tion gained by using an ali-

as to solicit mail from about

200 groups. He said he re-

ceived materials which de-

scribed the programs of the

groups and he turned it over

to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt

said, he was fired by police

because "they said they did

not have enough money to

keep me on a full-time ba-

sis." He said he had been

receiving $50 a. week and

expenses. His contacts in-

troduced him to two FBI

agents in the Washington

field office for whom he

subsequently went to work,

he said.

BY MERRITT'S. account,

his FBI assignments be-

tween October 1971 and

May 1972 centered on the

Institute for Policy Studies.

The FBI wanted him to get

a job there and supply them

with the names and license

tag numbers of persons at

institute meetings, he said.

Merritt said one of the

lists he supplied was from a

meeting on prison abolition

at which a civil rights law-

yer, Philip J. Hirschkop

spoke. He said he followed

Hirschkop after one of the

meetings at FBI request

and reported the lawyer's

movements and contacts.

Merritt said he worked

for the FBI until May 1972,

a month after his mother

died. He said the death

"really put me down" and,

rogether with a belief that

the persons he was told to

watch did not seem as dan-

gerous as they had been

ortrayed, by his contact

e decided to quil

NW. 55306-. DocJds32989628

Ha said his FBI contagts

reacted by "telling me they

had to0 much time and

money invested :.

• that I

had become familiar with

the political community and

I was trained the way they

wanted. One of them told

me to use the work as a way

to get my mind off my moth-•

; o er's death.

IN MAY, however, he de-

liberately filed a false re-

port as the last step in a

pattern that had begun four

months earlier of giving as

little information to his con-

tacts as he could,

said. It worked, he said, and

(the FBI agents let him. go

with verbal threats against

revealing his role.

Merritt said one of the

agents warned him against

speaking out by saying,

"We'd sure hate to have

someone find you in the

Potomac wearing cement

galoshas." He was also told

he had been doing "national

security-type work," the

disclosure of which would

be improper, he said.

Merritt said that when the

around, his former police

contacts reappeared. He

decided then to get legal

help in his effort to end as-

sociation with law enforce-

ment agencies and contact-

ed Washington lawyer Da-

vid Isbell, he said.

Merritt said a second

threat came from one of his

police contacts when the

contact learned Merritt was

considering public disclo-

sure as a means of keeping

police away from him. He

said the officer told him, "If

you'try to badmouth us or

any'other agencies, you'll

really meet your maker."

ACCORDING to the rec-

ords Merritt kept and dis-

played of his associations

and assignments, the last

threat came in July 1973. He

did not know how his former

contact had learned of his

plan and has had no direct

sonact with police since, he

Marritk, a self-acknowl-

edged homosexual,

said he

had been recruited in April

1971 the day after he had

lost a job. He disputed the

privaic

assessments of

some police sources who

said he had been fired "be-

cause he didn't produce"

and was angry at those who

had let him go.

"My con-

tacts told me my work was

good," Merritt said.

Ann Kolego was describ

ed by police officials as a

police buff "who was ex-

tremely good" in supplying

information on the activities

of antiwar and other protest

groups.

"She had to be to stay

under cover for so

long

without being burned," one

official said.

According to her former

roommate, Carol Cullum,

Miss Kolego was known as

"Crazy Annie" to the activ-

ists and posed as a dropout

from George Washington

University with a huge infe-

riority complex and willing-

ness to do the menial jobs of

the protest movement-

stuffing envelopes, handing

out pamphlets and running

errands.

MISS CULLUM said she

first remembered Miss Ko-

lego during the May Day

Between then

and now, she said, Miss

Kolego was a regular part

of the Washington Peace

Action Coalition, the Peo-

ple's Coalition for reace

and Justice,

the Anti War

Union, and the Miami Con-

vention Coalition.

According to Miss Cul-

lum, Miss Kolego was "al-

ways around and rarely

had to be invited to a meet-

"She was always there

Miss Cullum said

• Miss Cullum said she con-

fronted Miss Kolego at 2

luncheon late last month

after learning Miss Kole-

go's real job.

At the lunch, Miss Cullum

said Miss Kolego apologized

for having used their friend-

shipour Said it was her joo..

Miss Cullum attributed

disclosure of Miss Kotugu's

identity to the underground

newspaper The Daily Rag

and the Committee for

Action/ Rescarch on the In-

telligence Community - a

local group studying how

police and other govern-

ment agencies seek to keep

watch on activist political

groups.

MERRITT SAID his con-

tacis had often had high

praise for "Informant Ann"

and in conversations during

and alter May Day 1971 had

said she was the police

source closest to Rennie

Davis, one of those acquitted

in the Chicago Seven con-

spiracy trial.

Miss Cullum said Miss

Kolego was last seen by her

friends in the activist com-

munity in August 1973 at a

birthday party for Norrine

Banks, the third person who

shared an apartment with

Miss Cullum: and Aliss Kale-

gu. Police records show

Miss Kolego was appointed

a police officer June 25,

1973.

Police officials denied

any connection with

break-in at the Cullum

apartment in August 1972

when tapes of talks with

North Vietnamese envoys in

Paris were stolen and a tel-

evision set left behind. They

also denied Merritt was

asked by police to do any-

thing illegal.

Miss Kolego was not

available for comment.

There is little information

available about precisely

what she reported to police,

but her roommate said Miss

Kolego had had

of the planning of

most of the protest activity

in Washington during the

past to years.

She was also known to

have gone with other active.

THE TRANSFER of in-

unknown to Merritt or any

of the other informants with

gate committee testimony

of John W. Dean IlI, Dean

collaborated with an agent

from the Alexandria office

of the Alcohol,

Firearms Division of the

Treasury who, like Merritt,

was gathering intelligence

on May Day 1971 activities.

According to Merritt, the

•agent told him his unusual

assignment to intelligence

duties stemmed from a Jus-

tice Department order for

all federal agencies and

some local police to provide

reports on protests or plans.

The unit usually deals with

violations of alcohol, tax

and firearms law.

Department

officials

close to

the intelligence

units of May Day 1971 de-

clined comment: However,

one source said estimates of

the numbers

and plans of

protesters had been passed

regularly from Justice to

the White House and Dean.

The source said he did not

know where the information

came from and had as.

sumed it was from the FBl.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINCION: D.C. 20535

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

OCTOBER 31, 1975

Recently a number of allegations made by Earl Robert

Merritt, Ji., charged FBI Special Agents Terry O'Connor and

William Tuckes with certain improper and possibly illegal acts.

These charges have been publicized extensively in the news.

media.

The FBI. initially felt constrained from commenting

on these allegations because. of certain pending civil litigation

in which Merritt is involved as a witness.

Now, however,

because of the apparent authority being gained by these.

allegations through repetition in the media, and because of

their effect on the two Agents involved and their families,

the FBI feels that it should respond to these allegations. In

doing so, care is being taken to insure that this response will in

no way interfére with a fair adjudication of the civil proceedings.

Specifically, the allegations are that Merritt committed

break-ins and thefts on behalf of the FBI; that there were

indications that Merritt was encouraged to develop an intimate

relationship with another indiviäual to obtain information; that

he was asked to testify improperly concerning the 1972 Pentagon

bombing; and that he was asked to report gossip concerning

members of congress.

These allegations are fabricated and

completely false.

NW 55306 DocId:32989698 Page 109°

## Page 110

: Merritt initially contacted the FBI in october,

1971, indicating that he wished to furnish information to the

FBI and receive compensation for this information.. No pressure

was used to influence Merritt as his activities wece clearly

voluntary. Merritt was never instructed, ordered or in any-

way

encouraged to break into or otherwise illegally enter any

establishment or to commit any thefts or any other illegal

acts. He was never requested by the FBI to be a witness in any

fashion concerning the Pentagon bombing. or to report rumois

concerning members of Congress. Additionally, at no time was

Merriit encouraged or instructed to develop an intimate or

improper selationship with anyone.

As a matter of fact, Merritt was specifically advised

on several occasions that he was not to engage in any illegal

activities in his efforts to obtain information and,. further;

that he was not to construe his furnishing. information to the

FBI as a shieid from prosecution for illegal activities.

Merritt was at no time an employee of the FBI. He

was not regularly salaried but was paid on a C.O.D. basis for :

information furnished. • His relationship with the FBI was

terminated in early june, 1972, when it was determined

l. that

certain information furnished by him was unreliable.

The FBI categorically denies that the activities of

the Agents in contact with Merritt were at any time improper

Date and City

Where Cashed:

May 4, 1970,

Charleston, W. Va.

YEAGER advised that all of these checks were

returned by the National Savings and Trust Company of

Washington, D. C., marked "Account Closed."

YEAGER recalled that on May 4, 1970, he received

a telephone call from a woman representing herself to be

a customer of the bank named COCHRAN.

She said that her

nephew was in town and wanted to cash a check. YEAGER told

her that this would be okay, however, he requested that she

endorse the check.

A short time later, a white male, 5'9" - 5'10" tall,

170 pounds, age about 28, came to the bank with the first of

the above described checks.

It had not been endorsed

by

COCHRAN; however, the man did have a savings statement for

COCHRAN and YEAGER decided that this would be satisfactory.

COCHRAN approved the check for payment and did the same for

another check on May 6, 1970.

YEAGER does not know if he

would recognize this individual again or not.. After these

checks and one other were returned, YEAGER called the

phone number listed on one of the checks by MONROE 202-338-

3100. He found that this was listed to a medical credit

association for whom MONROE worked at one time.

This

f1rm

has received numerous complaints about MONROE.

This

Iirm's employment record shows that he gave a previous

address as C. P. FRISBY, 5729 Midland Drive, Charleston,"

W. Va, phone 925-5313.

YEAGER also talked to a MI. OSCAR L. COCHRAN,

5729} Midland Drive, who 1s a brother to WILLIAM JOSEPH

COCHRAN.

OSCAR L. COCHRAN knew of no one by the name of

JAMES R. MONROE, but he does have a nephew of EARL ROBERT

MERRITT who has

worked in Washington, D. C., and who has been

in trouble before.

XEAGER believes that WILLIAM J. COCHRAN, their

customer, is now a teacher in Mississippi. He received a

phone call from WILLIAM COCHRAN or perhaps his wife and

she advised that MERRIlT also uses the name ROBERt

OCTAVIO CHEVALIER. This individual also furnished a phone

number of 483-8823 and an address 1722 19th Street Northwest,

Apartment 205, Washington, D. C., 20009, for MERRITT.

PATRICIA DIDAS, teller, Kanawha Valley Bank,

advised that she cashed checks for "JAMES R. MONROE

on May 4, 6 and 7, 1970.

The checks which were handled on May 4 and May 6,

were approved by Vice President W. D. YEAGER.

DIDAS did

not get Y'EAGER's approval for the check cashed May 7, 1970.

DIDAS recalled that on May 7, MONROE deliberately waited

until she was available to cash his check when he could

have gotten faster service by going to one of the other

tellers.

She described MONROE as a white male, age 27,

IDENTITY OF SEPARATE DISCONTINUEN INFORMANT DELETED

AS

Joseph Anthony Barrett, who Is mentioned in the

article, was a security informant ot lEO from 10/70 to o/73.

He originally contacued Weo in 5/70 and volunteered his

services. He was approved as a potential security informant

in 10/70 after wnich he reported on demonstrations by

Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), National Peace

Action Coalition

and Peoples Coalition

for Peace and Justice.

He reported on the activities of IPS personnel who were

involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and he

reported on the planning for mass

demonstrations in

Washington, D.C., by Rennie Davis.

Barrett traveled to Miami

and

reported un

the activities of

dissident groups and

individuals at the Democratic and Republican National Convention

in the Summer of 1972. He subsequently provided information

abat the demonstrations at the Presidential Inauguration in

1/73.

In 6/73 he was discontinued as an informant at his

own request when he advised he was attempting to obtain a

second job and would not be able to obtain information for

the FBI and he had also developed great animosity for the

people such as those at IPS about whom he was reporting and,

INFORMATION

PROVIDE

therefore could not provide competent coverage.

IPs, which is mentioned in the article, was the

subject of a preliminary inquiry by the FBI in 11/68

after information was

received Indicating a possible connection

between IPS and SDS.

The investigation was expanded in 1971

after it was determined that IPS planned to embark on a five year

plan for the radical reconstruction of American society and

had circulated to radical groups around the country a document

calling for brigades to

descend on Washington, D.C., and close

down Government agencies.

The current investigation of IPS

is directed toward those

areas in which violations of Federal.

statutes may be developed in view of the activities of IPS

personnel involving the Midale Last and the Araos,

North and South Vietnam, Tanzania and the Pan-African Movement and

contacts with subversive organizations and individuals in the

United States.

OBSERVATIONS:

In answer to Mr. Kelley's question "any untruths

in this story?" the following should be noted:

Merritt's claim of having performed illegal

acts for the FBI has been denied

by the Special

• Agents

directed him.

Merritt's claim that he was hired by WrO at $50

to $75 a week is inaccurate.

He was paid, on a c.o.d. basis,

In varied amounts

between $20 and $30. which were paid on

various dates two to five times per month beginning in 10/71

and ending in 5/72 for a total amount of $1, 570.

Barrett's claim

informant while at the Republican National Convention after

seeing a WAll member on crutches

stumble and unable to get

out of the tear sas is questionable, since he continued to

furnish information for several months thereafter for which he

was paid both services and expenses.

Barrett's claim that he was paid only expenses but no

salary is not totally correct.

While not paid a salary,

Barrett

was reimbursed for his expenses and in addition was paid more than

$2,500 on a c.o.do basis for services.

It should also be noted that WEO advised at the

time Barrett was discontinued as an informant he advised he

still had the greatest admiration for the FBI and agreed

wholeheartedly that he would not reveal his work, written or

oxal, with the Bureau.

RECON-ENDATION:

None.

This is for your information.

On 10/2/73 led Stout of the "Washington Star-News" called

Herington and said that Merritt had furnished the paper information concerning

his prior informant status, claiming to have been a paid FBI informant from

October, 1971, until May, 1972, at which time he was discontinued because he

furnished us false information about Jack Davis. He claimed his assigned task .

was to monitor the Institute for Policy Studies, 1520 New Hampshire Street,

Northwest, Washington, D. C., and to keep an eye on Jack Davis, who was

associated with the Institute. He said that he had been a police department

informant prior to working for the FBI and Stout said that this had been con-

firmed by the police. Merritt said that he had been handled by Washington

Field Office Agents William Tucker and Terry O'Connor, and that when he

was discontinued in May, 1972, Tucker had threatened him by saying, 'We

would hate to have someone find you in the Potomac with cement galoshes."

He also alleged that Tucker threatened to have him prosecuted on three ola baa

check charges in which Merritt was involved.

Herington told Stout that he would have to get back in touch with

him later. Bureau files reveal that Merritt was a criminal informant

2121(WE 4015-C) from late 1971 until he was discontinued by Washington Field

letter dated 6/8/72. He was targeted against the Institute for Policy Studies

and Jack Davis mainly because Davis was considered a Weatherman fugitive

support person and because we had information that some of the Weatherman

fugitives had visited the Institute. Merritt also furnished other valuable

criminal information. Merritt is a homosexual and was determined to be

unreliable, at which point he was discontinued. Although he has not been

identified by name, we believe he is responsible for allegations which resulted

in the attorney for the Institute for Policy Studies claiming the FBI and the

Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) were engaged in illegal surveillance

Of' is activities and other illegal conduct. We conducted a preliminary civil

rights investigation on these allegations in August, 1973, and the results hare?

Re: Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Department. Agents who

handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to

him.

Herington called Stout back today and told him that as a matter of

policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential

information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this

time that we could say about Merritt's allegations. Stout said that he under-

stood and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt

claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to

the FBI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not

terribly sophisticated in its handing of informants. He said also that he knew

that Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really zeliable.

some of his allegations have not checked out at ael in further inquiry by Stout.

Herington also pointed out to Stout that neither/the allegations alleging threats

against Merritt could be interpreted as threats even if the statements had been

made.

He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing

themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-

tion against them for having helped the FBI. The statement that we would hate

to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing

that woulá be an admonishment against his self-disclosure because/some of

his friends might seek revenge.

Herington told Stout that it was ridiculous

to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was

also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on

checks, this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since

it was obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might

cause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

Stout said that he took everything Merritt said with a grain of salt.

Stout, of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says

• he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in

our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he

sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants

but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He

said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBi and indicated

that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.
