with persons at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), 1520
New Hampshire Avenue, N.W.', Washington, D.C., who have stated
that he is being considered for a job at IPS. These persons are

WFO 137-5692

The source advised that he has never been arrested
although he has been detained by law enforcement personnel on
several occasions. A search of the files of the Metropolitan
Police Department and U.S. Park Police disclosed no record
identifiable with the source under his true name or any of his
aliases. A check of NCIC reflected no warrants for the source
under his true name or aliases.

A review of WFO indices reflects that the’ source was
the subject of WF 87-18178. Under the name JAMES R. MONROE,
the source had, during May, 1970, cashed three checks totalling
$225.00 at Charleston, West Virginia, on a bank in Washington,
D.C. The checks were returned to the Charleston Bank, Prosecu-
tion in this matter was declined on 2/23/71, by AUSA ROBERT B.
KING, Southern District of West Virginia, because the amount
of money involved and evidence available did not justify further
investigative efforts to locate and interview MERRITT.

The source explained that he had at one time cashed
several checks amounting to a little over $200 while he visited

’ Charleston, West Virginia, during the Spring, 1970. He stated

that he has made efforts to negotiate payment of these checks

_and that he has at no other time and will never again engage

in this practice.
J. IDENTIFICATION RECORD

A request for an Identification Record was made on
11/8/71. No criminal or civil file identifiable with the source
under his true name or aliases was located.

persons engaged in criminal activity. He is an admitted homo-
sexual and this has brought him into contact with other homo-
sexuals who engage in various types of criminal activities. The
source has in the past furnished information concerning persons
involved in a homicide, narcotics, armed robberies, burglaries
and other crimes to the Metropolitan Police Department.

(WFOfile 100-46784)

IPS is located at 1520 New Hampshire eNenue N.W.,
Washington, D.C.

The source has furnished information concerning IPS
on a continuing basis. On 10/5/71, the source advised that he
had attended a meeting regarding prisons held at IPS on 9/21/71.
This meeting was dominated by ARTHUR. IRWIN WASKOW and JOANN
MALONE. These two persons are the subjects of WFO file
105-50397 (Bufile 105-114241), captioned "ARTHUR IRWIN WASKOW,
SM-NEW LEFT" and WFO file 100-49419 (Bufile 454221), captioned
"JOANN MALONE, SM-NEW LEFT." The source also furnished infor-
mation on 10/6/71 concerning another meeting involving the
prison issue held at IPS on 10/5/71. This meeting, too, was
dominated by WASKOW and MALONE, i

On 10/13/71, the source advised that sometime during
September, 1971, MALONE had discussed the subject of FBI
surveillance of IPS with him. She told the source that she
and others at IPS believed the FBI was watching them from a
building across the street, from a room in the Dupont Plaza
Hotel (to the right of the IPS building) and possibly from the
building on the other side of the IPS building. It was further
believed that the IPS building was "bugged" and that the FBI
was using sophisticated electronic equipment to pick up con-
versations in and around IPS. Because of these suspicions,

~5 -

WFO 137-5692

persons associated with IPS discuss important matters outside
the building.

_ The source provided a description on 10/13/71 of that
part of the IPS building with which he is familiar.

On 10/20/71, the source advised that WASKOW had talked
with him about the possibility of working for IPS or persons
associated with IPS. WASKOW was not specific about the job
and during subsequent contacts the source advised that he was
having difficulty locating WASKOW at IPS and.that when he did
talk with him WASKOW was still noncommittal concerning the job.

On 11/16/71, the source advised that he had spoken
with MARCUS RASKIN at IPS, RASKIN is the subject of WF 100-45298
(Bufile 100-454040) captioned "MARCUS GOODMAN RASKIN, SM-NEW
LEFT." RASKIN told the source on 11/15/71 that the source was
being considered for a job which would involve assisting WASKOW
and others at IPS. RASKIN said that further thought was being

given this possibility and that the source should return to see
him at 1:00 p.m., 11/23/71. _

“On 11/9/ 71, the source advised that MALONE had commented

upon the apathy toward the prison issue and the fact that a

meeting would be held on the evening of 11/11/71 to renew

interest in the issue. On 11/10/71, the source stated that

MALONE had again expressed her concern concerning lack of interest
. In the prison issue and had set forth her ideas as to what

course of action should be undertaken to better publicize and

renew interest in the issue. MALONE said that she was disappointed

in the response of the black community to the prison issue.

Although the source has not observed nor heard anything of
SPIEGEL, it is believed that the fact that the source is
oceasionally in the IPS building will enable him to be in an
advantageous position to observe SPIEGEL or any other of the

New Left fugitives should they make contact with-persons at
IPS .-

have lived with "RANDY" COLEMAN (EDWARD SCOTT COLEMAN),
reportedly a homosexual, when COLEMAN was arrested by the MPD
in connection with fire bombing of financial institutions in the
northwest area of Washington, D.C. The two were supposed to have
lived together at 2120 0 Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

This information was furnished to the Alcohol, Tax
and Firearms Division (ATFD), which is investigating the fire
bombings. It is also noted COLEMAN has been indicted on

eo

“WFO 137-5692

The information furnished by the source regarding’
IPS and persons associated with IPS has been of value as intelligence
data. The source is one of only a few sources in a position to
furnish information concerning IPS which is described as the
“think tank" of the New Left. .

Se

Infortiation regarding Dr. WILLIAM PIERCE and HAMILTON
MICHAEL BARRETT is of value from an intelligence standpoint
and has substantially aided the ATFD in its investigation of
possible ad and explosives violations on the part of these
persons. . :

The source spends much time in many areas of Washington,
D.C., particularly Dupont Circle, and this enables him to be
observant concerning fugitives and for the matters of interest
to the Bureau. The fact that he is a homosexual permits a
to furnish information of value to the Bureau concerning: --’
persons in the homosexual community, and enable WFO to fulfill
its responsibilities for identifying homosexuals in government.

M. EMOTIONAL STABILITY

During contacts with this informant the informant has
exhibited no traits of emotional instability or unreliability,
nor is it know that the informant has furnished any false infor-
mation. :

(DAVIS is a homosexual, according to WF ie sas oe other
Sources).

It should be noted that WFO-is attempting to
obtain information concerning DAVIS' activities, acquaint-
ances, and attitudes; as well as knowledge he might have
concerning CAPBOM or the WEATHFUG subjects. Placing the -
informant in a position where DAVIS will trust him so that
such information can be obtained is a gradual process and
WFO takes this fact into consideration in paying this source.

the possibility of traveling to New York in the immediate

For Police
Exposed A

, By Paul W. Valentine
Washington Post Statt Writer
Recent disclosures by an ac-
tivist community newspaper of
police informant activities
within Washington's once-
flourishing antiwar movement
have jeopardized political in-
telligence gathering -opera-
tions, D.C. police officials said
yesterday.
The disclosures, part of an
ongoing campaign by the anti-
establishment Daily Rag news-
paper, are “definitely a threat
{o our operations,” acknowl
edged Capt. George Sutter,
acting director of the police
départment’s intelligence di-
vision.
Sutter confirmed the identi-
fication of two one-time infor-
wants named. in front-page
stories in the last two issues
of the Daily Rag.
‘The first story named Ann
Kolego, 20, also known as
“Crazy Annie,” aS a paid po-
lice informant who infiltrated
the D.C. offices of the Peoples.
Coalition for Peace and Jus-
tite (PCPJ) and National!
Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC) from early 1971 to
Sune 25 of this year.
‘Sutter rated her as an~“ex-
cellent” intelligence source.
~The second story named Earl
Robert Merritt Jr., known to
police as “Butch,” who worked
‘asa paid informant for about
five months around the time?
of the massive Mayday disrup-
tions here in the spring of
1971.
‘Merritt was quoted in the
Rag as saying he later did in-
fformant work for the FBI. FBI
press spokesman Jack Her-
rington would not comment
on that claim, but another
fsource close io the FBI con-
firmed that Merritt performed
~“voluntary” work for” the

District police intelli-
gence operatives were
keeping watch on the city’s
antiwar community and
other activists as recently
as June, according to a
former paid informant. The
surveillance began at least

two years ago, the informer

said.

Police said reports based
on informers’ information
were given regularly to the

{ FBI. Some information may

have been passed to the
White House. One informer
said his tactics included
burglary and disruption of
protests.

While police officials con-
firmed the identity and in-
formant assignment of two
persons, one of whom was
interviewed by,the-Star:

AMONG NATIONAL
* groups attracting police

can Academy of Political
Science, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and the
Coalition on National Prior-
ities and Goals, whose mail
solicitations for members
were signed by Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis.

Among local groups were
the American Nazi party,
the Black United Front, the
D.C. Statehood party and
the Institute for Policy

radical alternatives to U.S.
foreign and domestic policy,
which is located at 1520 New

MERRITT SAID he

petitions, pamphlets, meet-
ing notices and other mate-
rials and give them to police
-contacts who told him they

recall.such an incident in

one attached any signifi-
cance to it at the time.

Before and after the big
May Day 1971 antiwar pro-
test, Merritt said, he visited
the offices used by groups
largely responsible for the
protest: the People’s Coali-
tion on Peace and Justice,
Vietnam Veterans Against
the War, and the Lanier
Place residence used by
some demonstration plan-
ners.

AT POLICE request,
Merritt said, he supplied
telephone numbers and
floor plans for these offices.
“I thought at the time it was.
a check on whether I was
going to the places they
asked me to," he said. Mer-
ritt did not know how police

may have.used this infor
mation. Re said »—--+—»

During tHe demonstra-
tigm-htertit* contimaed, he
telephoned reports to police
up to 16 times a day and
joined with some law en-
forcement offices in at-
tempts to disrupt activities.
These included spreading
false information about
meeting times and places
and sabotaging one of the
protestors’ public address
systems, he said.

"After May Day 1971, Mer-
ritt said, police asked him
to concentrate on informa-
tion gained by using an ali-
as to solicit mail from about
200 groups. He said he re-
ceived materials which de-
‘scribed the programs of the

groups and he turned it over ~

to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt
said, he was fired by police
because ‘‘they said they did
not have enough money to
keep me on a full-time ba-
sis.” He said he had been
receiving $50 a week and
expenses. His contacts in-

| troduced him to two FBI
agents in the Washington
field office for whom he
subsequently went to work,
he said.

BY MERRITT’S account,

| his FBI assignments be-
tween October 1971 and
May 1972 centered on the
Institute for Policy Studies.

| The FBI wanted him to get
a job there and supply them
with the names and license
tag numbers of persons at
institute meetings, he said.

_ Merritt said one of the
lists he supplied was froma
meeting on prison abolition
at which a civil rights law-
yer, Philip J. Hirschkop,
spoke. He said he followed

1 Hirschkop after one of the
meetings at FBI request
and reported the lawyer's
movements and contacts. +
1 Merritt said he worked
{for the FBI until May 1972,
a month after his mother
died. He said the death
“really put me down” and,-
together with a belief that
the persons he was told to
watch did not seem as dan-
gerous as they had been

portrayed by his contacts,
he decided to quit

|

Hesaid his FBI contags ts
reacted by “‘telling me they
had too much time and
money invested. . . that I
had become familiar ake
the political community anc

Twastrained the way they

anted.,One of them told
me to use the work as a way
to get my mind off my moth- +
er’s death.

j IN MAY, however, he de-
liberately filed a false re-
_ port as the last step in a
pattern that had begun four
months earlier of giving as
little information to his con-
tacts as he could, Merritt
said. It worked, he said, and
[the ‘FBI agents let him go
with verbal threats against
revealing his role.

Merritt said one of the
agents warned him against
speaking out by saying,
“We'd sure hate to have
someone find you in the
Potomac wearing cement
galoshas.” He was also told
he had been doing ‘‘national
security-type work,” the
disclosure of which would
be improper, he said.

Merritt said that when the
agents stopped coming
around, his former police
contacts reappeared. He
decided then to get legal
help in his effort to end as-
sociation with law enforce-
ment agencies and contact-
ed Washington lawyer Da-
vid Isbell, he said.

Merritt said a second
threat came from one of his
police contacts when the
contact learned Merritt was
considering public disclo-
sure as a means of keeping
police away from him. He
said the officer told him, “If
you try to badmouth us or
any other agencies, you'll
really meet your maker.”’

ACCORDING to the rec-
ords Merritt kept and dis-
played of his associations
and assignments, the last

 Mapeitt , a self-acknowl-
edged homosexual, said fe :
had been recruited in April
1971 the day after he had

- lost a job. He disputed the

private assessments of
-some police sources who
said he had been fired “‘be-
cause he didn’t produce’
and was angry at those who
had let him go. “My con-
tacts told me my work was
good,” Merritt said.

". Ann Kolego was describ-
ed by police officials as a

“police buff ‘‘who was ex-

tremely, good” in supplying
information on the'activities
of antiwar and other protest

S- praneers
“She had to be to stay
under cover for so long
without being burned,” one
official said.
“According to her former
roommate, Carol Cullum,
Miss Kolego was known as
“Crazy Annie” to the activ-
ists and posed as a dropout
from George Washington

_ University with a huge infe-

riority complex and willing-
jess to do the menial jobs of
the. protest. movement—

_ stuffing envelopes, handing

out pamphlets and running
* errands.

MISS CULLUM said she
first remembered Miss Ko-
lego during the May Day
.1971 protest. Between then"
and now, she said, Miss
Kolego was a regular part
of the Washington Peace
Action Coalition, the Peo-
ple’s Coalition for Peace
‘and Justice, the Anti War
“Union, and the Miami Con-
vention Coalition.

. According to Miss Cul-
jum, Miss Kolego was ‘‘al-
ways around”? and rarely
had to be invited to a meet-
ing. “She was always there

Miss Cullum said.

-Miss Cullum said she con-
fronted Miss Kolego at a
luncheon late last month
after learning Miss Kole-

0's real job.
if At the iunch, Miss Cullum
said Miss Kolego apologized
for having used th \d-
str ‘aid it was he

Miss Cullum ‘attributed
disctosaré of Miss-Rotegt's
identity to the underground
newspaper The Daily Rag

and the Committee for ,

Action/Research on the In-
telligence Community — a
local group studying how
police and other govern-
ment agencies seek to keep
watch on activist political
groups.

MERRITT SAID his con-
tacts had often had high
praise for “Informant Ann”
and in conversations during
and after May Day 1971 had
said she was the police
source closest to Rennie
Davis, one of those acquitted
in the Chicago Seven con-
Spiracy trial.

Miss Cullum said Miss
Kolego was last seen by her
friends in the activist com-
munity in August 1973 at a
birthday party for Norrine

anks, the third person who
shared an apartinent with

Miss Cullum and Miss Kale-
a fice records show
Miss Kolego was appointed
a police officer June 25,

1973,

Police officials denied
any connection with a
break-in at the Cullum
apartment in August 1972
when tapes of talks with
North Vietnamese envoys in
Paris were stolen and a tel-
evision set left behind. They
also denied Merritt was
asked by police to do any-
thing illegal.

Miss Kolego was not
available for comment.
There is little information
available about precisely
what she reported to police,
but her roommate said Miss
Kolego had had access to
much of the planning of
most of the protest activity
in Washington during the
Past two years,

She was also known to
have gone with other activ-
ists to the Republican con-
vention at Miami Beach last

THE TRANSFER of in-
formation from D.C-inform-
ants to the White House was
unknown to Merritt or any
of the other informants with
whom the  Star-Néws
talked. But in the Water-
gate committee testimony
of John W. Dean III, Dean
recalled receiving intelli-
gence reports from District
police. Merritt said he had
collaborated with an agent
from the Alexandria office
of the Alcohol, Tax and
Firearms Division of the
Treasury who, like Merritt,
was gathering intelligence
on May Day 1971 activities.

According to Merritt, the
-agent told him his unusual
assignment to intelligence
duties stemmed from a Jus-
tice Department order for
all federal agencies and
some local police to provide
reports on protests or plans.
The unit usually deals with
{violations of alcohol, tax
| and firearms law.

' Department officials

, close to the intelligence
units of May Day 1971 de-
- clined comment; However,
one source said estimates of
the numbers and plans of
protesters had been passed
regularly from Justice to
the White House and Dean.

fugitives had visited the Institute. Merritt also furnished other valuable
criminal information. Merritt is a homosexual and was determined to be

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Depar rtment. Agents who
handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to
him. :

Herington called back today and told him that as a matter of
policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential
information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this
time that we could say about Merritt's allegations. said that he under-
stood and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt
claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to
the FBI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not
terribly sophisticated in its kndlirg of informants. He said also that he knew
that’ Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really reliable.
Some of his allegations have not checked out at } in further inquiry by
Herington also pointed out to that neither/the allegations alleging threats
against Merritt could be interpreted as threats.even if the statements had been
made. He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing
themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-
tion against them for having helped the FBI. The statement that we would hate.
to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing
that would be an admonishment against his self-disclosure becausesome of
his friends might seek revenge. Herington told that it was ridiculous
to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was
also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on
checks. ,,this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since

it was obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might
- cause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

i : said that he took everything Merritt said with a grain of salt.

_ of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says
- he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in
our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he
-sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants
“but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He
said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBI and indicated
that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.

Two Litt Curtain on a Undercover Work

Tell of Successes, Failures as Infilirators of Antiwar Groups.

aa
By Paul W. Valentine
Washington Post Staff Writer

‘Two men who infiltrated
the antiwar movement here
ffor the FBI and D.C. police
from 1970 through 1972 have
described their operations,
parting the curtain momen-

~ tarily on the tangled world
of the political undercover
informant.

In interviews with The
Washington Post, they de-
tailed their successes, fail-
; ures, a few absurdities, but
" most of all the personal con-
fusion, ambivalence and ag-

- ony they said they endured
; in doing such work for the
i country.

Much of theirswork, they
| said, was superficial and pe-
i ripheral, and in the long run
{ they provided little they
j coyld judge as being of real
{ consequence,
| The FBI, in keeping: with

time-honored tradition, does.

not ot officially acknowledge
that either man worked for
the agency. But it has been
independently determined
that both were utilized as
potrectlevel FBI informants
—one on a $50-l0-S75-a-week
salaried basis, the other pri-
marily as a volunteer on an
expenses-only basis. One"
man also worked for the

ing class grunts . and
spoiled upper class WASP
and Jewish kids.” -

nancial or political cireum-

tions long after his original
zeal to do so had ceased.

though they both conducted

Barrett, “working more as

Merritt's identity was first

“My motto was ‘let’s rj
‘enrbirahd do sontetnmng to
’em,’” says Barrett, recall-
ing how he first entered

antiwar demonstrations here"

in the late 1960s as a free-

lance observer and _ocea-
sional street fighter who

would trip, punch and jab
demonstrators during me-

Jees with the police. It was a

habit he took him

when he joined the’ FBI in-

‘ormant ranks in 1970, but

he says he has since repdi-
ated it.

: “At first, I-thought my an-
tagonism toward the left

was an ideological one,”
* Barrett said, “but now I know
it was cultural.

; “Pm working-class Irish
“Catholic ... These upper
class WASP and Jewish kids
of the new left were the
sons and daughters of the
people charging me 36 per
eent on a -loan ‘They
owned the slums and the
tenements. They paid only
$1.25 an hour for hard work.

- “Those kids really held us
“in contempt-—us, the work-
ing class slobs, the beer
drinkers, the hard hats, the
pigs, the grunts—the people
who fight the wars and po-
lice the streets of this coun-
try, who keep. the nation
moving while they piddle
around with their intellectu-
alism.”

| Thus, said Barrett, when
he became an informant, “I
had joined the army of the
Lord.”

" Three years later, Barrett,
the: onetime GOP ward:
sheéler in Maryland and
hard-nosed Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom (YAF) ac-
tivist, is not so sure. Three
years in the trenches with
the new left had taken a cer-
tain toll.

;*I had a hell of a time
krjowing where I began and
Where my role ended.” he
said. “I was very confused.
“I knew I was no longer a
Y¥AFer, but I didn’t want to
get into the left culture. gi

ig] felt 1 was lying on a
jungleisland surrounded by
fever swamps recovering
from the withdrawal symp-
toms of a true believer.”

- He said, “When I started,
T'could give you an operat-
ing definition of ‘right’ and
‘Teft,’ but there’s no way in
God’s world I could do. it
now.”

* Barrett still hag not re-
solved questions _ about
Ywhether current FBI sur-
veillance practices are mor-
ally correct.

“If the government hears
that a group is trying to
blow up the Capitol or kill
the President,” he said, “it
“has a right to find out if it
is true and stop it through
surveillance ... But, if they
find out it is not true, how
do you pull ’em back? How
do you keep surveillance
within limits? That's the
“problem, as I see it. Once
the surveillance ball starts
rolling, it’s hard to stop it.”

Because so many police-
men and other law enforce-
ment officers are “working
class ethnics” with a heavy
infusion of Catholic conserv-
atisin, they are naturally an-
tagonistic toward the “smart
middle-class airs” of the
new left, Barrett said.

He described the FBI as a
“bunclr of Fordham boys
watching Harvard boys.”

While Barrett perceives
himself as a person strug-
gling to comprehend the cul-
“tural gap between the right

and the left, Merritt said his -

fundamental lack of educa-
tion in the realm of politics
of either the left or the
right made it difficult for
him to penetrate the anti-
War movement with any real
activist credibility,
Uninitiated in radical left
literature or rhetoric, he
was unable to participate in
political discussions and
never tried to insinuate him-
self into the movement’s ad-
ministrative hierarchy, de-

spite i y
pite police requests-that he

do sorterwatd, ag

®

“But, there were, other
Peojite tHe, too, who were
just as naive and ignorant
as I was,” he said, “so I
didn’t stick out like a sore
thumb.”

Merritt first entered the
world of undercover surveil-
lance when he was recruited
by the Washington police
department to do criminal
narcotics work in the Du-
pont Cirele area in mid-1970.

-With the build-up in prep-
arations for the massive an-
tiwar Mayday protests the
following spring, however,
he was switched to the po-
lice intelligence division. He
was assigned the code name
“Butch” and control number
16. A

The police department
confirmed his identity but,
ike the FBI. would not dis-
cuss details of his job.

Merritt said police intelli-

geneefecruiters specifically

sought him because they +

wanted a “white gay male”
to cultivate antiwar gay ac-
tivist Jack Davis who: was
reputed to be organization-
ally close to Rennie Davis
(no relation), longtime war
protester and a chief archi-
tect of the planned Mayday
disruptions.

But Merritt did not get
far, “I tried to get close to

both of them,” he said, “but .

just impossible ... ‘They
were too busy moving
around,” and he relayed no
important information on ei-
ther of the Davises to police..
Soft spoken and cleat sha-
-ven with short red hair,
Merritt said he tried to
blend into the antiwar
crowd at organizational
meetings by playing the role
of “just another activist.”
Paddling about from one
antiwar office to another in
downtown Washington, he
said, he did odd jobs as a
“volunteer” while noting au-
tomobile tag numbers and
the names and addresses of
activists and phoning them

in yegularly to the police in-
sellgene d ivisiof.

The police “asked me to
joifrthe (Mayday; “inarshal
training, too,” he said, “but
T couldn't get into it...I
‘was too spread out.”

As the tempo of surveil-

lance increased in the weeks
just before Mayday, “I was
asked to call in (to
intelligence) every hour .. .
Tealled in up to 16 times on
Mayday itself” giving first
hand street reports of activ-
ity.
* The Mayday protest ac-
tion—which triggered the
arrest of more than 12,000
persons, along with inten-
sive barrages of police tear
gas-and the brief occupation
of portions of the city by
federal troops—also brought
on what Merritt says was
his first disillusionment.
with the law enforcement
establishment.

The. mass arrests and
what he described as brutal-
ity by police “disgusted me,”
Merritt said,. and he began
questioning ' police _ proce-
dures, including intelligence
gathering.

Heretofore, he “said, he
had believed police surveil-
Jance “was the right thing to
do because I believed (the
antiwar movement) was a
communist attempt to over-
throw the government.”

“Now his perspective was
changing, he said.

Though he wanted -to ex-
tricate himself from infor-*
mant work, he said, there
also “was the matter of
some (bad) checks” he had
written earlier in West Vir-
ginia and he feared the po-
lice might threaten him
With arrest for the checks if
he stopped working for
them.

So he continued on the
Police payroll, he _ says,
drawing $50 a week salary
plus expenses of §25 to $35 a
week,

He went through a
“limbo” period for the next
two months as antiwar

st actiyjty dwindled al-
ter Mayday, he siti"



Then on July 16, 1971, he
said, the Intelligenee divi
sion asked him to
“concentrate” on the Insti-
tute for Policy Studies at

1520 New Hampshire Ave.

“I didn’t even know what
it was,” he said. “They told
me it was a communist
think tank.

(fhe IPS, a frequent tar-
Set of criticism by conserva-
tive political figures, is de-
scribed by its co-directors
Marcus Raskin and Richard
J. Barnet asan independent
-center for research and edu-
eation in alternative con-
cepts of public policy in
such areas as foreign aid,

education, military budget,
and health services. The pri-
vately funded institute sup-

. Ports 17 fulltime fellows
and a research staff of
about 50 persons.)

Merritt said police inter-
est in IPS was apparently
whetted by announcement
that a series of weekly
Marxism-anaxchism __semi-
nars were to be held there,

led ‘by Marxist scholar
Alfred Henley -and Karl
Hess, one-time Goldwater
speech writer turned an-
archist theoretician and ex-
aminer of alternative life
styles, :

“My job was to go to the
classes and count how many
people were there,” Merritt
said.

In addition to any names
he could obtain, he said, po-
lice asked him for an attend-
ance breakdown as to males
and females, blacks and
whites, “Jews, Germans and
people of eastern European.
extraction.”

He said, “I was told to
Jook for Europeans in look
and dress . .. They told me
to look for certain clothing
styles (and) physical appear-
ances, like high cheek
bones. High cheek bones
were supposed to be Ger-
man or Russian or some-
thing... Yes, accents, too. £
was supposed to report for-
eign accents.”

He said he told police that
“most people at IPS were
Jewish.” Asked how he dis-

stinguished Jews from non-

Jews said he could do it

NW 55306 Dogid: 329896

uevaguely,"then added that

: nie pone mentors;>“ht” a
rather facetious manner,
used Arthur Waskow as a
comparison model.”

Waskow, a hefty bearded
man, is an IPS fellow and
veteran activist in antiwar
and Jewish affairs here.

In addition to monitoring
the Marxism-anarchism sem-
imars, Merritt said, police
asked him to seek a job as a
research assistant to one of
the IPS fellows.

Merritt voiced concern
that he was not education-
ally equipped for such a
role.

“I questioned my ability
tq do it,” he said, “but the
police seemed to think it

_ Would be (the job of) a glori-
fied errand boy.”

Half heartedly, he said, he
‘applied’ for the job but
never got it.

In the meantime, Merritt
was “terminated” by the po-
lice department (the wave
of dramatic antiwar street
demonstrations had subsided
by mid-1971, he said, and
the intelligence division was
running out of money to
pay informants).

With the recommendation
of his police superiors, he
was hired by the Washing-
ton field office of the FBI at
'$50 to S75 a week and con-
tinued his work at the IPS.

He was by this time so
disillusioned with the law
enforcement establishment,
he said, that he was deliber-
ately cutting down on the
amount of information he
reported. He said he main-
tained the guise of the
former, however, because
needed the money” and be-
cause of the continuing pos-
sible threat of arrest for the
checks in West Virginia.

{itis FBI control agents ad-
ditionally instructed him, he
said, to watch for “Weather
fugitives” entering the IPS,
a reference to a dozen re-
puted members of the vio-
Jent underground Weather-
man organization wanted in
connection with the bom-
bing of numerous public

buildings, includine thesCap-,

itol; troughout the nation.

Moszriti.said he xenoxted
no Weather peoplé entering
the IPS and in fact told
Jack Davis, alleged by po-
lice to have above-ground
contact with the Weather or-
ganization, about what he
was doing.

Likewise, Barrett said the
{FBI asked him to watch for
“couriers” at IPS delivering
money to Weather fugitives.
Supplied with photographs
of six or seven suspected.
couriers, Barrett said he
sighted one and reported his
presence immediately, He
said he does not know if the
FBI took any action.

Merritt says he became so *

distraught with his- IPS
work that by September,
1971, he told Robert E. Herz-
stein,an IPS board member
and attorney in the firm of
Arnold & Porter about it,
and in December, 1971,
made a similar confession to
Arthur Waskow.

Yet, for another six
months, until June, 1972, he
continued calling in low-
grade intelligence reports to
Ithe FBI field office, he said,

When he could stand it no
longer, he said, he deliber-
ately falsified a report on
Jack Davis’ whereabouts.
fFBI field agents quickly d
“termined through other in-
formants that the report
was incorrect, Merritt said,
and he was fired.

He has since tried to drop
out of sight, refusing to di-

| vulge his home address or

place of employment.
Barrett says he was first
tilized by the FBI in the
spring of 1970, after he and
@ companion. offered the
agency some film they had
taken of street demonstra-
tions in Washington.
Thereafter, he said, he
monitored demonstrations
regularly, phoning in street
actions and plans to the
field office. He also contin-
ued to shoot moving film of
demonstrators and was

reimbursed for his camera
otha

He said he was also asked
to “Checkout” Kari” Hess,
who by 1970 had tiwned
away from Goldwater con.
servatism and became active
in the antiwar movement,
living in a houseboat colony
off Buzzard Point in South-
west Washington.

“They wanted to know
what he was doing,” Barrett
said. “There were rumors he
was messing with some
pretty heavy people.”

Barrett pursued Hess spo-
radically at first and did not
begin to “zero in” on him
until the summer of 1971, he *
said, when Hess and Henley
began their Marxism-anar-
chism seminar at IPS.

Though he devoted most
of his time to Hess, Barrett
says he circulated generally
through IPS, coming " to
know many of its research
fellows, exchanging political
views * with them and
“playing the role of resident
redneck.”

“I even joked about the
fact that I was an infor-
mant,” he said. “I refused to
play the game of being sym-
pathetic to the new left. T
spoke and acted oxactly the
way Ifelt... The only thing
wag they djdn’ really, know



NW 55306 _Docld 32989698

that Lwas,in fact an infor-
nace =

Hess recalls Barrett as a
“very. thoughtful, — smart
guy” who liked to write and
who “made some really inci-
sive criticisms of the new
left’s misunderstanding of
the right in America.”

Barrett for his part said
he never observed Hess do-
ing anything worth report-
ing to the FBI. a

In fact, he said,
“everything I saw at IPS
was completely legitimate.
They (IPS research fellows)
probably won't like it, but
their operation there, with
its emphasis on individual
decisions and decentraliza-
tion of power, reminds me
of a sort of 1948 Robert Taft
workshop.” a

In addition to monitoring
Hess and the presence of
Weather “couriers at IPS,
Barrett says he attempted to
determine if any of the se-
eret Pentagon papers di-
vulged by antiwar activist
Daniel’ El'sberg had been
copied at IPS. He said he
was also asked to find out
details about a “delegation”
of IPS ‘members going to

“Paris in 1972 to meet with
the Hanoi‘entourage at the
Vietnam peace talks.

He said he found no evi-
dence that the Pentagon. pa-
pers were copied at IPS and
determined only
“approximate _ departure
times” of two IPS flights to
Paris. 7 of

(IPS co-director Raskin
says only he and fellow co-
director Barnet went to
Paris, each on separate
flights and each “primarily
on a journalistic assign

papers. He said they met
and talked with both the Ha-
noi and National Liberation
Front (NLF) delegations in
thatconaeetion),

Barrett says his_derision

to quit _imformant work oc-
curred at the 1972 Republi-
can National Convention in
Miami Beach where he had
volunteered to film demon-
strations and monitor street
actions for the FBI.

During the last night of
the convention when police
and demonstrators clashed
violently and tear gas was
sprayed into the crowds, “I
saw this VVAW (Vietnam
“Veterans Against the War)

stumbled down and couldn’t

testing ihe government,
when it’s the spoiled kids
from Yale and Harvard that
set off the police? It wasn’t
the vets. ‘They're a very dis-
ciplined group.”

Barrett stressed that he
always maintained his inde-
pendence from the FBI be-
cause “I was never salaried
like some of these other
guys. I wanted it that way.”

In interviews, Barrett re-
fused to specify his control
agents, his code name or de-
tails of his financial at-
rangements.

Unlike Merritt, Barrett
fsays his FBI superiors ex-
plicitly instructed him not
to violate any laws or insti-
gate sabotage or violence.
- Though he acknowledges
ripping down Vietcong flags
and “punching out a few
people” during street dem-
onstrations, the actions were
not requested or sanctioned
by his bosses. he said. a

On the other hand, Mer-
rit said his FBI control
agents encouraged him “to
take anything” from the
IPS, “but they would never
say exactly what or how.

he broke into the Commu-

NW, in late May, 1971, at po-
Tice suggestion and stole a
quantity of antiwar petitions
containing names and ad-

porters.

In addition, he said he
fashioned three false identi-

false information about
places and times of demon-
strations and yanking the
wires and tubes from two
sound systems at the May-
day encampment in West

“Memorandum to Mr, W. R, Wannall

Re; Unknown Subjects; Marcus Raskin and
the Institute for Policy Studies-Victims

provided directly to the WSPF by Merritt who he said was
publicly identified as a former informant for the FBI.
Martin said he was aware of the, FD-302's prepared by SAs
Tucker and O'Connor relative to their knowledge of Merritt's
activities as an informant and that he did not feel these
FD-302's covered the current allegations.

At this point, Martin was asked point blank what
these "new allegations" consisted of, and whether the CRD,
which has been handling this case, was aware of them, Martin
replied that the use of the word "allegation" in the WSPF
letter had perhaps been a mistake as it was quite strong” but
that the new information centered around a claim made by Merritt
that the FBI had received stolen mail from Merritt knowing
it to be: stolen. In this regard, Merritt claims that he ‘took
mail from the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), Washington,
DBD. C., turned it over to one of the two WFO Agents, who later
returned it to Merritt with instructions to return it to the
IPS office. Martin stated Merritt had furnished WSPF with
additional information and allegations concerning the FBI but
that after looking into Merritt's background and considering
the information, that he, Martin, did not feel that this
additional information had any merit whatsoever. He said he
could not, however, permit the charge of receiving stolen mail

- to’'"lay in his files," and that it was for this reason he

desired to interview SAs O'Connor and Tucker.

It was then pointed out to Martin that FD-302 dated
6/28/73, prepared by SAs Tucker and O'Connor noted receipt
from Merritt on one occasion of an envelope containing some
material which lerritt explained had come from the trash at
IPS. Although the Agents did not closely examine all of the
material, it did appear to be trash. No inventory was made of
all the items and the material was returned to Merritt as soon
as he could again be contacted at which time he was told that
if the material belonged in the trash zt IPS, that is where it
should be placed. Merritt was also told again as he had béfore
that the FBI never wanted him to obtain such materials from the

IPS and that the only other materials provided by Merritt from

IPS were leaflets intended for the public.

~ ' Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Unknown Subjects; Marcus Raskin and
_the Institute for Policy Studies-Victims

Martin said he was aware of this FD-302 and its
contents but that he continued to feel the necessity of
interviewing SAs Tucker and O'Connor relative to Merritt's
claim, He stated, however, that he was not in any rush to
interview the Agents, since he desired to review the CRD
file in this matter prior to such interview... At this point
the conversation was terminated.

It should be noted that at one “point during the
conversation, Martin commented that, "It’s not a place where
our.jurisdiction is very strong," (apparently referring to
WSPF investigation of Merritt's latest allegations) but that
the WSPF did have some standing in the, matter since the
incident "could" have arisen from pressure exerted by The
White House.

SUBJECT: EARL ROBERT MERRITT iG a Tronng

PURPOSE: :

To answer allegations, which are false, by

Earl Robert Merritt, a former criminal informant of WFO, i
that he carried out tactics like those described in the
Cointelpro report nearly a year after the program was

ordered halted and that his target was Jack Davis, an
organizer of the 1971 May Day demonstrations,

BACKGROUND:
By memorandum from T. W, Leavitt 11/20/74,

which is attached, you were advised that Assistant Director
McDermott telephonically advised him on that date that boa
Mr. Orr Kelly, a reporter for "The Washington Evening Star News"
newspaper had been in contact with Earl Robert Merritt.
According to Kelly, Merritt identified himself as a former
FBI informant and said he carried out tactics like those
-described in the Cointelpro report in January, February,
and March of 1972; that he worked under the direction of t
Special Agents Terry O'Conner and William Tucker of WFO; and i}
that his target was Jack Davis, an organizer of the May Day ~~ saat
demonstrations in 1971, who at that time was a desk man at
@ sauna bath in Washington, D, C. Merritt claimed he was
instructed to become intimate with Davis (he said both were
homosexuals) and that he was instructed to make phone calls
to Davis' friends and employees accusing him of cooperating
with or working, for the FBI and of being dishonest in handling
of money. He claimed he did not know why but Davis lost his

’ . Job and became depressed. Mr. Kelly desired a comment on _. wom

OBSERVATIONS ;
eee

Memorandum to Mr. W. R, Wannall
Re: Earl Robert Merritt

it is noted that Merritt was told that the FBI was interested

in information concerning John Rankin Davis, who was then a
suspect in the 3/1/71 bombing of the U.S. Capitol Building

and was also believed by WFO to possibly be in contact with

some of the Weatherman fugitives. Merritt advised the Agents
that he had first met Davis, whom he knew as Jack Davis, in

May of 1971. From January, 1972, to May, 1972, Merritt reported
conversations he said he had with Davis concerning his Weatherman
associates, reported information he believed linked Davis with
the Capitol Building bombing, reported that he had seen Davis with
an individual Davis said was Weatherman fugitive William Ayers

and reported on several occasions that Davis had wanted him to
accompany Davis to New York and wanted him to rent an apartment

as a safehouse for fugitives, On 5/30/72 when Merritt claimed

he had talked with Davis in Washington, D. C., Davis was being
interviewed by Bureau Agents at Lake Ariel, Pennsylvania, During
the interview, Davis related having met an individual in
Washington, D. C., known to him as "Butch" whom he suspected was
an informant. He related "Butch" on one or two occasions attempted
to persuade him to travel to New York and once talked about
renting an apartment as a safehouse for fugitives, After reviewing
the above, WFO felt "Butch" was identical with Merritt, that

doubt had been cast on his credibility, and therefore, he was
discontinued as an informant.

oe

By teletype 11/20/74, which is attached, Special
Agents O'Conner and Tucker baehad eae denied Merritt's allegations.

avis was never a target of 3 any Cointelpro, which
program was discontinued 4/28/71, nor was he* targeted against
Davis in any way which can be interpreted as counterintelligence,.
On the contrary, it appears Merritt, in reporting on Davis, lied
to WFO Agents regarding Davis in order to obtain money, In a

‘Washington Post" article, 11/26/73, Merritt exposed his role as

NW 5530

an FBI informant, outlined his activities as an informant,
including targets assigned to him, methods of payment and reasons
why he ceased his informant activities. In the article, Merritt
lied about performing illegal acts for the FBI and lied about his
payments, Merritt's present allegations to Orr Kelly that he
carried out tactics like those described in Cointelpro are false,
and this appears to be another attempt by him to obtain notoriety.

RECOMMENDATION:
mat the allegations by Merritt to Orr Kelly be

categorically denied. wy L

’ Beginning with the conversation on October 1, 1971,
Merritt steted that he spent a great deal of time at the
Institute for folicy Studies (Iv5), Washington, Gc. Ce).
He purported to have free and rightful access to the premises
of IPS at which he performed odd jobs and attended ueetings.
He stated thet he had become as at TrS,

_ployed at IPS, principally Arthur Keskow and Marcus Raskin,
The association esong these persons had existed before these
Weatherman members, particular! ‘Ly Hichael Spiegel, Cathlyn
Platt likeeson and William Ayers, became fugitives. It was
believed that having someone lika Nerritt with Waskow an ik
Raskin on a legitimate and somewhat reguler basis might result a
im the development of information which would lead to the i
apprehension of sone of these fugitives, It might also result :
in the development of inforration concerning civil disruptions ’
and other illegal activities. 7 :

Sometime around December 3, 1971, Nerritt began to report
that Marcus Raskin had promised him a job as an assistant to
Aéxthur Weskow. Waskow had initially been unhappy thet thes
arrangezents were made without his knowledge but that the job
would begin after January 1, 1972, Prior to that date, Weskow
was to spend some time in orientation sessions vith Merritt.
Merritt thereafter reported that he had difficulty in getting in-
touch with Waskow regarding these sessions. le furnished a
letter from IPS dated Decenber 18, 1971, stating that no new |
‘personnel would be hired at 17S, He talked with Kaskow on :
“December 27,.1971, and on this occasion Yaskew told him that he
should not worry about this letter and vas still being considered
for a fob. ow added that his. sourees had indicated that

: On January 13, 1972, Merritt advised that he had |
attempted to contact Waskow on the same date but had been

referred to an attorney, Robert Herzstein, who was with the
. Law firm of fanold and Porter, WDC. He contacted erystein
who told i

‘i TPs. Werzstes in | and

On Jenuary 28, 1972, FKerritt advised that on the
previous day he had gone to oe offices of an attorney named
Rogovin at Arnold and Porter at poco recuest. A Fr.
Barnet’ from PIS was also prosen in Rozovin's office. Rorovin

asked if he knew any "pay" police officers vho mirht be vol~
merable to approach (for purposes of obtaining info:

and told him that if Merritt wanted the job he would have to
submis to a polyrrarh e nation which Poeovin was reluctant
to administer because 1¢ a¢ked of the police state.

At this time ft became abundantly clear that
Merritt's continued association with IPS or persons therefrom
vould be counterpraductive in that 1) Merritt was over his
head dealing with persons at IPS who vere uncuestionably in-
tellectually superior to him, 2) that he had constantly teen
put off concerning the rosition at IPS and had teen furnishine
no inferration concermine any association of Weatherman fuctitives
and persons at IPS and 2) thet it was extrernely unlikely that
he vould ever obtain a position at IPS. Consequently, he
was immediately thereafter advised by SAs O'Connor and Tucker
that they no lonrer wanted him to associate with persons at
IPS for the purpose of obtaining information.

E. L. Recer to Mr. Cleveland -
Re; Earl Robert Merritt, Jr. a

After being closed, Merritt disclosed his former
relationship. with the Bureau to representatives of the media,
He made some untrue statements, including the allegation that
WFO Agents had threatened his life in an attempt to insure
that he never reveal his role as an informant.

The proper response to Merritt's request is, of
course, a matter to be determined by the Office of Legal
Counsel. It would appear, however, that the material in
the informant file is not "investigatory" in nature, and
the operation of an informant is not,.in and of itself, an
investigation. Other than the aforementioned ITSP case, the
only investigation of Merritt which is reflected in the
informant file is a check of appropriate local criminal
peneses when he was opened as a PCI.

Merritt provided information in natters within
our jurisdiction, but these of course do not relate to him
as a subject or suspect, and would notappear to fall within
the scope of his request. :

To advise of article appearing in 3/28/75.edition of
"The Washington Post," to the effect that information furnished
ie captioned individual to both the FBI and Washington

Metropolitan Police Department (IPD) while acting as an
informant is mostly irrelevant.

DETAILS:

"The Washington Post" edition of 3/28/75, on page
C~1 contains an article (attached), captioned "Informant's
Data Mostly Irrelevant," which refers to approximately 50
pounds of material compiled by Harl Robert Herritt for the
combined time he served as an informant for both the
Washington MPD and the FBI. The article contains no
allegations against the FBI, but highlights the super-
ficiality of information accumulated by Merritt during the
Jate 1960s and early 1970s. Merritt claims he was paid
approximately $1,500 by the MPD covering the period April
to October, 1971, and then he became an informant of id
FBI until June, iova, foliecting. another $3,009. .

Memorandum to Mr. W. R.
Re: Earl Robert Merritt
1387-28143

YWannall

he was in contact with Weatherman fugitives, From January,
1972, to liay, 1972, he reported on conversations he reportedly
had with Weatherman associates. On 5/30/72, however, he
reportedon a-conversation he was supposea to have had with
Davis in Washington, D. C., on the same date that Davis was
being interviewed by Bureau Agents in another part of the
country. Further, during the latter interview, Davis
described Merritt to Bureau Agents as an individual he
believed to be an informant. Services of Merritt were then
discontinued. :

In 9/74, Nerritt related to a news revorter that
he had carried out, for the Bureau, tactics described in
the then recently released COIHTELPRO report, nearly a
year and a half after the program was ordered halted, and he
made several allegations of improper conduct on the part of
handling Agents. All of the allegations were vehemently
refuted by involved personnel,and the news reporter was
furnished full facts concerning the matter. Details con~
cerning this incident were set forth in my memorandum -to
you dated 11/21/74, captioned above.

OBSERVATIONS:

The above article appears to be prefaced upon
another attempt by Merritt to obtain notoriety. As the
article contains no allegations against either .the Bureau
or its personnel, no additional action is deemed nec-
essary by this Bureau.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. Above submitted for information,

The files, consisting primarily of an-
tiwar tracts, leaflets, flyers, mailouts,
news clippings and other publicly avail-
able documents, have been described
by both Merritt and his superiors in
the intelligence division of the D.C. po-

_ lice department as “mostiy junk.”

Merritt estimates the FBI and D.C.
police paid him a total of $4,500 in sal-
aries and expenses for his efforts for a
14-month period between April, 1971,
and June, 1972. Both police and FBI
have verified that he worked for them?

Too Lift Curtain on Wales Work

’ Tell of Successes, Failures as Infiltrators of Antiwar Groups,_,

a7
By Paul W. Valentine
Washington Post Staff Writer

‘Two men who infiltrated
the antiwar movement here
for the FBI and D.C. police
from 1970 through 1972 have
described their operations,
parting the curtain momen-
tarily on the tangled world
of the political undercover
informant.

In interviews with The
Washington Post, they de-
tailed their successes, fail-
ures, a few absurdities, but
most of all the personal con-
fusion, ambivalence and ag-
ony they said they endured
in doing such work for the
country.

Much of their-work, they
said, was superficial and pe-
ripheral, and jn the long run
they provided little they
could judye as being of real
consequence.

The FBI, in keeping with
time: ‘honored tradition, does

not ot officialy acknowledze
that either man worked for
the agency. But it has been
independently determined
that both were utilized as
street-level FBI informants
‘—one on a S$50-to-$75-a-weck
salaried basis, the other pri-
marily as a volunteer on an
expenses-only basis. One’
man also worked for the
D.C, police department.

“of surveillance could not be

ments and other transac.

one-time penchant for vio-
lence who saw the police-
radical street clashes of the
antiwar movement as a
“cultural war between work-
ing class grunts ... and
spoiled upper class WASP
and Jewish kids.”

Each informant said he
was caught in a web of [i-

tions long after his original
zeal to do so had ceased.

Athen the FBI, each time on
a salaried basis, he says.
Barrett, “working more as
a volunteer than anything
else,” he says, was utilized

Merritt's identity was first
divulged by the Daily Rag, a
small activist community
newspaper here that pub-
lished a carefully worded in-

Oct, 5-12 issue. The text had

“My motto was ‘let's rip
‘snroirahd do sonieunmz to
"em,’” says. Barrett, recall-
ing how he first entered
antiwar demonstrations here
in the late 1960s as a free-
lance observer and occa-
sional street fighter who
would trip, punch and jab
demonstrators during me-
lees with the police. It was a
abit he took with him

he says he has since repdi-
ated it,

* At first, I-thought my an-
tagonism toward the left
was an ideological one,”
* Barrett, said, “but now I know
it was cultural,

“Ym working-class Irish
Catholic ... These upper
class WASP and Jewish kids
of the new left were the

* sons and daughters of the
people charging me 36 per
cent on a-loan ... They
owned the slums and the
tenements. They paid only
$1.25 an hour for hard work,

" “Those kids really held us

in contempt~-us, the work-.

ing class slobs, the beer
drinkers, the hard hats, the
pigs, the grunts—the people
who fight the wars and po-
lice the strects of this coun-
try, who keep. the nation
moving while they piddle
around with their intellectu-
alism.”
* ‘Thus, said Barrett, when
he became an informant, “I
had joined the army of the
Lord.”
“. Three years later, Barrett,
the one-time GOP ward-
cheeler in Maryland and
hard-nosed Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom (YAF) ae-
tivist, is not so sure. Three
years in the trenches with
the new left had taken a cer-
tain toll.

kriowing where I began and
Where my role ended,” he
aald. “I was very confused,

He said, “When I started,
T could give you an operat
ing definition of ‘right’ and
‘left,’ but there’s no way in
God's world*I could do, it
now.”

Barrett still has not re-
solved questions —_ about.
whether current FBI sur-
yeillance practices are..mor-
ally correct, aeean

“Sf the government hears
that a group is trying to
blow up the Capitol or kill
the President,” he said, “it
“has a right to find out if it
is true and stop it through
surveillance ... But, if they
find out it is not true, how
do you pull 'em back? How
do you keep surveillance
within limits? That's the
‘problem, as I see it. Once
the surveillance bali starts
rolling, it's hard to stop it.”

Because so’ many police-
men and other law enforce-
ment officers are “working
class ethnics” with a heavy
infusion of Catholic conserv-
atism, they are naturally an-
tagonistic toward the “smart
middle-class airs” of the
new left, Barrett said.

\He described the FBI as a
“bunch of. Fordham boys
watching Harvard boys.”

While Barrett' perceives
himself as a person strug.
gling to comprehend the cul-
“tural gap between the right
and the left, Merritt said his
fundamental lack of educa-
tion in the realm o£ politics
of either the left or the
right made it difficult for
him to penetrate the anti-
war movement with any real
activist credibility.

Uninitiated in radical left
literature or rhetoric, he
was unable to participate in
political: discussions and
never tried to insinuate him-
self into the movement's ad-
ministrative hierarchy, de-
spite police requests that he

But Merritt did not get
far. “I tried to get close to

just impossible ‘They
were too busy moving

important information on ei-
ther of the Davises to police.

Soft spoken and clean sha-
ven with short red hair,
Merritt said he ‘tried to
blend into the antiwar
erowd at organizational
meetings by playing the role
of “just angther activist.”

Paddling about from one
antiwar office to another in
downtown Washington, he
said, he did odd jobs as a
“volunteer” whilenoting aur

the names and addresses of
activists and phoning them

. Heretofore, he ~said, he
had believed police surveil-
Jancé “was the right thing to
do because I believed (the
antiwar movement) was a
communist attempt to over-
throw the government.”
Now his perspective was
changing, he said.

Though he wanted -to ex-
tricate himself from infor-
mant work, he said, there
also “was the matter of
some (bad) checks” he had
written earlier in West Vir-
ginia and he feared the po-
lice might threaten him

tute for Policy Studies at
1520 New Hampshire Ave.
NW. :

“I didn’t even know what
it was,” he said. “They told
me it was a communist
think tank.”

(The IPS, a frequent tar-
Bet of criticism by conserva-
tive political figures, is de-
scribed by its co-directors
Marcus Raskin and Richard

+ J. Barnet asan independent
center for research and edu.
cation in alternative con-
eepts of public policy in
sitch areas ‘as foreign aid,
education, military budget,
and health services, The pri-
vately funded institute sup-
ports 17 full-time fellows
and a research staff of
about 50 persons.)

Merritt said police inter-
est in IPS was apparently
whetted by announcement
that a series of weekly
Marxism-anarchism —semi-
nars were to be held there,
led by Marxist scholar
Alfred Henley sand Karl
Hess, one-time Goldwater
speech writer turned an-
archist theoretician and ex-
aminer of alternative life
styles.

“My job was to go to the
classes and count how many
people were there,” Merritt
said.

In addition to any names
he could obtain, he said, po-
lice asked him for an attend-
ance breakdown as to males
and females, blacks and
whites, “Jews, Germans and
people of castern European
extraction.”

He said, “I was told to
Jook for Europeans in look
and dress . .. They told me
to look for certain clothing
styles (and) physical appear-
ances, like high cheek
bones. High cheek bones
were supposed to be Ger-
man or Russian or some-
thing... Yes, accents, too, I
was supposed to report for-
tign-accents.”

He said he told police that
“most people at IPS were

-“vaguely"then added that

‘his pon fice’ mentors;“i” a
rather faeetious manner,

used Arthur Waskow aS a
comparison model.”

Waskow, a hefty bearded
man, is an IPS fellow and
yeteran activist in antiwar
and Jewish affairs here.

In addition to’ monitoring
the Marxism-anarchism sem-
inars, Merritt said, police
asked him to seeka job asa
research assistant to one of
the IPS fellows.

Merritt voiced concern
that he was not education-
ally equipped for such a
role.

iwi questioned my ability
tq do, it.” he said, “but ‘the
police seemed to think it
would be (the Job of) a glori-

fied errand boy.”

Holf heartedly, he said, he
‘applied for the job but
never got, it.

In the meantime, Merritt
was “terminated” by the po-
lice department (the wave
of dramatic antiwar street
demonstrations had subsided
by mid-1971, -he’ said, and
the intelligence division was
running out of money to
pay informants). ©

With the recommendation
of his police superiors, he
was hired by the Washing-
ton field office of the FBI at
'850 to S75 a week and con-
tinued his work at the IPS.

He was by this time so
disillusioned with the law
enforcement establishment,
he said, that he was deliber-
ately cutting down on the
amount of information he
reported. He said he main-
tained the guise of the in-
former, however, because "T
needed the money” and be-
cause of the continuing pos-
sible threat of arrest for the
cheeks in West Virginia.

(iis FBI control agents ad-
ditionally instructed him, he
said, to watch for “Weather
fugitives” entering the IPS,

puted members of the vio-
lent underground Weather.

‘Mossittssaid he venotted
no Weather people entering
the IPS and in fact told
Jack Davis, alleged by po-
lice to have above-ground
contact with the Weather or-
ganization, about what he
was doing.

Likewise, Barrett said the
\eBl asked him to watch for
“couriers” at IPS delivering
money to Weather fugitives.
Supplied with photographs
of six or seven suspected
couriers, Barratt said he
sighted one and reported his
presence immediately. He

{said he does not know if the
FBI took any action.

Merritt says he became so
distraught with his~ IPS

} work that by September,
1971, he told Robert E. Herz-
stein, an IPS board member
and attorney in the firm of
Arnold & Porter about it,
and in December, 1971,
made a similar confession oe
Arthur Waskow,

Yet, for another six
months, until June, 1972, he
continued calling in low-
ees intelligence reports to
\the FBI field office, he said.

+ When he could stand it no
longer, he said, he deliber-
ately falsified a report on
Jack’ Davis' whereabouts.
f¥BI field agents quickly de-
Aermined through other in-
formants that the report
was incorrect, Merritt said,

i] and he was fired. ~

He has since tried to drop
out of sight, refusing to di-
vulge his home address or

jptilized by the FBI in the
‘spring of 1970, after he and
a, companion offered the
agency some film they had
taken of street demonstra-
tions in Washington.

Thereafter, he said, he
monitored demonstrations
regularly, phoning in street
actions and plans to the
field office. He also contin-
ued to shoot moving film of
demonstrators and — was
reimbursed for his camera
costs, he Said,

said. “There were rumors he}

said, when Hess and Henley | {

of his time to Hess, Barrett ©
says he circulated generally -
through IPS, coming to .

fellows, exchanging political
views with them and
“playing the role of resident
redneck.”

“TI everi joked about the

Hess recalls Barrett as @
“very thoughtful,“ smart
guy” who liked to write and
who “made some really inci-

Barrett for his part said
he never observed Hess do-
ing anything worth report-
ing to the FBI. S
In fact, he — said,
“everything I saw at IPS
was completely legitimate.
‘They (IPS research fellows)
probably won't like it, but
_ their operation thei with
its emphasis on individual
decisions and decentraliza-
tion of power, reminds me
of a sort of 1943 Robert Taft
workshop.” .

Barrett says he attempted to
determine if any, of the se-
‘eret. Pentagon papers di-
vulged by antiwar activist
Daniel’ Elisberg had been
copied at IPS. He said he
was also asked to find out
details about a “delegation”
of IPS members going to
“Paris in 1972 to meet with
the Hanoi entourage at the
Vietnam peace talks.
He said he found no evi-
dence that the Pentagon pa-

determined only the
“approximate departure
times” of two IPS flights to
Paris. :
(IPS co-director. Raskin
says only he and fellow co-
director Barnet went to
Paris, each on separate
flights and each “primarily
on a journalistic assign-
ment” for major U.S. news-
papers. He sald they met

Daily Rag staff workers say

For Police

Exposed .

By Paul W. Valentine

Washington Post Staff Writer

Recent disclosures by an ac-
tivist community newspaper of
police informant activities
within Washington’s once-

- flourishing antiwar movement
have jeopardized political in-
telligence gathering opera-
tions, D.C. police officials said

| yesterday.

‘he disclosures, part of an
ongoing campaign by the anti-
establishment Daily Rag news-
paper, are “definitely a threat
to our operations,” acknowl
edged Capt. George Sutter,
acting director of the police
department's intelligence di-
vision.

Sutter confirmed the identi-
fication of two one-time infor-
mants named in front-page
Stories in the Jast two issues
of the Daily Rag.

The first story named Ann
Kolego, 20, also known as
“Crazy Annie,” as a paid po-
lice informant who infiltrated
the D.C, offices of the Peoples
Coalition for Peace and Jus-)
tive (PCPJ) and National)
Peace Action _— Coalition
(NPAC) from early 1971 to
June 25 of this year.

Sutter rated her as an~‘ex-|
eellent” intelligence source. *

‘The second story named Earl
Robert Merritt Jr., known to
police as “Butch,” who worked
‘asa paid informant for about!
five months around the time:
of the massive Mayday disrup-
tions here in the spring of
1971.

Merritt was quoted in the
Naz as saying he later-did in-
{formant work for the FBI. FBI
press spokesman Jack Her-
ringten would not “comment

fsource close to the FBI con-
firmed that Merritt performed.

Merritt came directly to the
paper with his acknowledge-
ment of spy work after being
“turned off” by the job, ac-
cording to Rag staff worker,
Chris Simpson. '
‘The disclosure of Miss Ko-
lego as an informant was
leaked to the Rag by a Wash-
ington-based organization
called the Committee for Ac-
tion/Research on the Intelli-
gence Community (CARIC).
CARIC spokesman Winslow

Asked how CARICTSabIe to

mants, Peck said, “We have

Staffers at the Daily Rag,

have questioned the legality
and authorization for some of
the informant work done by
Merritt and Miss Kolego.

Before and after the big

test, Merritt said, he visited
the offices used by groups
largely responsible for the
protest: the People’s Coali-
tion on Peace and Justice,
Vietnam Veterans Against
the War, and the Lanier
Place residence used by
some demonstration plan-
ners.

Merritt said, he supplied

During \ife demonstra-
tin Merritt conéimed, “he
telephoned reports to police
up to 16 times a day and
joined with some law en-
forcement offices in at-
tempts to disrupt activities.
These included spreading
false information ,about
meeting times and places
and sabotaging one of the
protestors’ public address
systems, he said.

After May Day 1971, Mer-
ritt said, police asked him
to concentrate on informa-
tion gained by using an ali-
as to solicit mail from about
200 groups. He said he re-
ceived materials which de-
scribed the programs of the
groups and he turned it over
to the police.

In October 1971, Merritt
said, he was fired by police
because “‘they said they did
not have enough money to
keep me on a full-time ba-
sis.” He said he had been
receiving $50 a week and
expenses. His contacts in-

| troduced him to two FBI
agents in the Washington
field office for whom he
subsequently went to work,
he said.

BY MERRITT’S. account,
i] his FBI assignments be-
+ tween October 1971 and
4 May 1972 centered on the
+, Institute for Policy Studies.
,! The FBI wanted him to get
} ajob there and supply them
} With the names and license

tag numbers of persons at

| . Merritt said one of the
! lists he supplied was from a
i meeting on prison abolition
at which a civil rights law-
yer, Philip J. Hirschkop,
spoke. He said he followed
Hirschkop after one of the
meetings at FBI request
and reported the lawyer’s
movements and contacts.

Merritt said he worked
1 for the FBI until May 1972,
a month after his mother
died. He said the death
“really put me down" and,
together with a belief that
the persons he was told to
watch did not seem as dan-
gerous as they had been
Postraved, by his contacts,
he decided to quit

«He said his FBI contacts
reacted by “telling me they
had too much time and
money invested. . . that T
had become familiar with
the political community and
J Wwas-trained the’ way they

wanted, One of them told
me to use the work as a way

to get my mind off my moth- +

i: ° er's death.

IN MAY, however, he-de-
liberately filed a false re-
port as the last step in a
pattern that had begun four
months earlier of giving as
little information to his con-
tacts as he could, Merritt
said. It worked, he said, and

[the FBI agents let him. go
: With verbal threats against
revealing his role,

Merritt said one of the
agents warned him against
speaking out by saying,
“We'd sure hate to have
someone find you in the
Potomac wearing cement
galoshas.” He was also told
he had been doing ‘‘national
seourity-type work,” the
disclosure of which would
be improper, he said.

Merritt said that when the
agents. stopped coming
around, his former police
contacts reappeared. He
decided then to get legal
help in his effort to end as-
sociation with law enforce-
ment agencies and contact-
ed Washington lawyer Da-
', Vid Isbell, he said. 5

Merritt said a secon
threat carhe from one of his
police contacts when the
contact learned Merritt was
considering public disclo-
sure as a means of keeping
police away from him. He
said the officer told him, “If
you try to badmouth us or
any'other agencies, you'll
really meet your maker.”

ACCORDING to the rec-
ords’ Merritt kept and dis-
played of his associations
and assignments, the last
threat came in July 1973. He
did not know how his:former
contact had learned of his
plan and has had no direct
contact with police since, he
said.

Merxitt, a self;acknowl-

had been recruited in April
1971 the day after he had
lost a job. He disputed the

some police sources who
said he had been fired “be-
cause he didn't produce”
and was angry at those who
had Iet him go. ‘My con-
tacts told me my work was

Ann Kolego was describ-

“She had to be to stay

Miss Kolego was known as.

ists and posed as a dropout
from George Washington
University with a huge infe-
riority complex and willing-
ness to do the menial jobs of
the protest movement—
stuffing envelopes, handing
out pamphlets and running
errands.

" MISS CULLUM said she
first remembered Miss Ko-

1971 protest. Between then
and now, she said, Miss
Kolego was a regular part
of the Washington Peace
Action Coalition, the Peo-
ple’s Coalition for Peace

Union, and the Miami Con-

According to Miss Cul-

e THE TRANSFER of in-

ants'to the White House was
unknown to Merritt or any
of the other informants with
whom: the Star-News
talked, But in the Water-
gate committee testimony
of John W. Dean Ill, Dean
recalled receiving intelli-
gence reports from District
police. Merritt said he had
collaborated with an agent
from the Alexandria office
of the Alcohol, Tax and
Firearms Division of the
Treasury who, like Merritt,
was gathering intelligence
on May Day 1971 activities.

According to Merritt, the
‘agent told him his unusual
assignment to intelligence
duties stemmed froma Jus-
tice Department order for
all federal agencies and
some local police to provide
reports on protests or plans.
The unit usually deals with
‘violations of alcohol, tax
and firearms law.

Department officials
close to the intelligence
units of May Day 1971 de-
clined comment: However,
one,source said estimates of
the numbers and plans of
protesters had been passed
regularly from Justice to
the White House and Dean.
The source said he did not

came from and had as-,

Says Police
Urged Theft!

By Paul W. Valentine:
and Lee A. Daniels ¢
‘Washington Post Statt Writers

A former D.C. police informs
ant contended —_ yesterday
that he was instructed by his
supervisor to steal mail, break,
into buildings and disrupt Ie.
‘gitimate demonstrations of {be
antiwar movement here in the
carly 1970s.

His assertion contrasts with’
those in a D.C. police depart.
ment report released Wednes-
day that said informants
“were instruetéd to engage in
no illegal activities” and no
“such activity is known to have

occurred.
Cc ? The informent Baslabert
| Memitt,30, says he was a $50
to§7oa-week “special ome
ployee” of the police depart
ment’s inteliigence division
and infiltrated antiwar groups

ugh 1972,

In addition to monitoring
and reporting routine activi-
ties of an’ Sroups and ine

dividuals, MMestitt told a rev
porter that on instructions
from police, he:

PhesITS Zandery—rieshas
headed a recent house clean-
ing of intelligence division
records, refused to comment.

Merritt, who “went public”
in mid-1973 and has spoken
previously about his, under
cover activity, has been con-|
firmed by police officials as ‘a
one-time informant.

Zanders said ‘he did not
want to comment on Merritt's:
present claims because of
pending litigation between the
police department-and the In-
stitute for Policy Studies.

The Institute year sued
two FBI agents, former Attor-|
ney G John N. Miteheil

ithe D.C. police department for’ }
yalleged illegal infiltration of

Police officials inctddrag
Zanders and Cullinane gener-
jally have declined to elaborate
on an extensive report issued
iby the department Werinesday
on activities of the intelli:
gence division from 1967 to.
the present. .

The report described in gen-

eral terms undercover opera-
tions by both pctice officers
and paid civilian informants
and included acknowledge-
ments, that ‘police borrowed
electronic equipment, cars and
men from the Central Intelli-
gence Agency on some occa-
sions.

In one of his few detaited
discussions of the report, Zan-
ribed how three po-

Officials of area universities
contacted said they did not
iknow whether undercover po-

dice otticer officers had operate
thoi campuses.

i ‘The officials said ‘they were
not approached by ~ anyone
from the Washington police
department regarding such
[placements.

William Ahlstrom, an Ametri-
“can University vice ‘president,
said, “We weren't approached,
and we woulda’t have ap-
proved such an operation if
we.were, It would be antithicti-
cal to the spirit of the univer:
sity. and of a free society”

Ahlstrom added, however, |
[that it would probably be im-
*possible to determine whether
{undercover dgents did operate
lon the campus because of the
Hfluid nature of tie university
community.

FEDERAL BUREAU ov INVESTIGATION |

WASHINGTON! D.C. 20535

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ~
OCTOBER 31, 1975 |

merees HE i Recently a number of allegations made’ by ‘Earl Robert
Nerritt, ore, charged FBI Special Agents Terry 0'Connor and
William Tucker with certain improper and possibly illegal acts.
These charges have been publicized extensively in the news...
: : The FBI initially felt constvainea from commenting |
on these allegations because. of certain pending civil Litigation
in which Merritt is involved as-a witness. Now, however, re . athe
because of the apparent authority being gained by these- pean i
allegations through repetition in the media, and because of
- their effect on the two Agents involved and.their families,
the FBI feels that it should respond to these allegations. In -
doing so, care is being taken to insure that this response will in
no way interfére with a fair adjudication of the civil proceedings.
Specifically, the allegations are that Merritt committed
break-ins and thefts on behalf of the FBI; that there were
indications that Merritt was encouraged to develop an intimate
xelationship with anothex individual ace obtain information;, that ;

he was asked to testify improperly con aAcerning the 1972 ‘Pentagon

bombing; and that he -was asked to report gossip concerning
members of Congress. ‘These allegations are fabricated and.

completely beech

55306 Docid:32989698 Page 109:



«Merritt initially contac ted the FBI in October,

1971, indicating that he wished to furnish information to ‘the

FBI and receive compensation for this information... No pressure =

was S used, to influence Merritt as ; his activities were clearly
voluntary. Merritt was never “instructed, ordered or in any-
way, encouraged to break into or otherwise illegally enter any
establishment or to commit any thefts or any’ other illegal
“acts. ° He was never requested by the FBI to be a witness in any
fashion concerning the eoaao “bombing. or to report rumors
concerning “members of Congress. Additionaliy, at no time § was
Merritt encouraged or instructed to develop on intimate or
improper relationship with Bayon i i 7

As a matter of fact, Merritt was specifically advised
on several occasions that he was not to engage ‘in any. (iLL egal,
activities in his efforts to obtain information and ,. further,
that he was not, to construe his. furnishing information to the
FBI as a shieid from prosecution for illegal activities.

Merritt was at no time an employee of the FBI. He

was not regulariy salaried but was paid on a C.O.D. basis for ;.

information furnished. - His relationship with the FBI was
-terminated in early June, 1972, when it was determined. that,
certain information furnished by him was unreliable. :

The FBI categorically denies that the activities of

the Agents in contact with Merritt were at any’ time improper

YEAGER advised that all of these checks were
returned by the National Savings and Trust Company of
Washington, D. C., marked "Account Closed."

YEAGER recalled that on May 4, 1970, he received
a telephone call from a woman representing herself to be
a customer of the bank named COCHRAN. She said that her
nephew was in town and wanted to cash a check. YEAGER told
her that this would be okay, however, he requested that she
endorse the check. a

A short time later, a white male, 5'9" - 5°10" tall,

‘170 pounds, age about 28, came to the bank with the first of

the above described checks. It had not been endorsed by

COCHRAN; however, the man did have a savings statement for
COCHRAN and YEAGER decided that this would be satisfactory.
COCHRAN approved the check for payment and didthe same for

‘another check on May 6, 1970. YEAGER does not know if he

would recognize this individual again or nots. After these
checks and one other were returned, YEAGER called the
phone number listed on one of the checks by MONROE 202-338-
3100, He found that this was listed to a medical credit
association for whom MONROE worked at one time. This

firm has received numerous complaints about MONROE, This
firm's employment record shows that he gave a previous
address as C, P, FRISBY, 5729 Midland Drive, Charleston,"
W. Va., phone 925-5313.

YEAGER also talked to a Mr. OSCAR L. COCHRAN,
5729} Midland Drive, who is a brother to WILLIAM JOSEPH
COCHRAN, OSCAR L. COCHRAN knew of no one by the name of
JAMES R. MONROE, but he does have a nephew of EARL ROBERT
MERRITT who has worked in Washington, D. C., and who has been
in trouble before. 7

YEAGER believes that WILLIAM J. COCHRAN, their

customer, is now a teacher in Mississippi. He received a

RE: Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.
137-28143

Joseph Anthony Barrett

IDENTITY OF SEPARATE DISSONTINVED INFORMANT DELETED AS
doseph Anthony Barrett, who is mentioned in the

article, was a security informant of WFO from 10/70 to 6/73.

He originally contacted WFO in 5/70 and volunteered his

services. He was approved as a potential security informant

in 10/70 after wnich he reported on demonstrations by

Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), National Peace

Action Coalition and Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice.

He reported on the activities of IPS personnel who were

involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and he

reported on the planning for mass demonstrations in

Washington, D.C., by Rennie Davis. Barrett traveled to Miami

and reported cn the activities of dissident groups and

individuals at the Democratic and Republican National Convention

in the Summer of 1972. He subsequently provided information

abot the demonstrations at the Presidential Inauguration in

1/73. In 6/73 he was discontinued as an informant at his

own request when he advised he was attempting to obtain a

second job and would not be able to obtain information for

the FBI and he had also devéloped great -animosity for the

people such as those at IPS about whom he was reporting and,

therefore, could not provide competent coverage, :

- IPS, which is mentioned in the article, was the
subject of a preliminary inquiry by the FBI in 11/68 :
after information was received indicating a possible connection
between IPS and SDS. The investigation was expanded in 1971
after it was determined that IPS olanned to embark on a five year
plan for the radical reconstruction of American society and
had circulated to radical groups around the country a document
ealling for brigades to descend on Washington, D.C., and close
down Government agencies, The current investigation of IPS

’ is directed toward those areas in which violations of Federal

statutes may be developed in view of the activities of IPS
personnel involving the Middle East and the Arabs,

- North and South Vietnam, Tanzania and the Pan-African Movement and
contacts with subversive organizations and individuals in the
United States.

OBSERVATIONS : ; : 4

: In answer to Mr. Kelley's question "any untruths
in this story?" the following should be noted:

Merritt's claim of having performed illegal °

acts for the FBI has been denied by the Special Agents who
directed him,

Merritt's claim that he was hired by WFO at $50

to $75 a week is inaccurate. He was paid, on a c.o.d, basis,
«in varied amounts between $20 and 830. which were paid on

4 various dates two to five times per month beginning in 10/71
: and ending in 5/72 for a total amount of $1,570.
E Ss. = . i

DINE EA... eg : seu a
Barrett's claim that ne cecided to quit as an
informant while at the Republican National Convention after
seeing a VVAW member on crutches stumble and unable to get
out of the tear gas is questionable, ‘since he continued to
furnish information for several months thereafter for which he
was paid both services and expenses,

* Barrett's claim that he was paid only expenses but no

Salary is not totally correct. While not paid a salary, Barrett
-{was reimbursed for his expenses and in addition was paid more tha’
$2,500 on a c,o,d, basis for services,

i It should also be noted that WFO advised at the
time Barrett was discontinued as an informant he advised he
still had the greatest admiration for the FBI and agreed

firmed by the police. Merritt said that he had been handled by Washington —
Field Office Agents William Tucker and Terry O'Connor, and that when he «~
was discontinued in May, 1972, Tucker had threatened him by saying, "We

Memorandum to Mr. Callahan
Re: Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

béen furnished to the Civil Rights Division of the Department. Agents who
handled Merritt deny any improper conduct or any improper instructions to
him. : :

Herington called Stout back today and told him that as a matter of
policy we simply could not identify individuals who had furnished confidential
information to the FBI in the past and, accordingly, there was nothing at this
time that we could say about Merritt's allegations. Stout said that he under-
stood and that actually his story was mainly about allegations made by Merritt
claiming MPD misconduct and that very little of the story would pertain to
the FBI. He said that he knew that the Intelligence Division of the MPD was not
terribly sophisticated in its hmdling of informants. He said also that he knew
that Merritt was a homosexual and that he did not consider him really reliable.
Some of his allegations have not checked out at all in further inquiry by Stout.
Herington also pointed out to Stout that neithersthe allegations alleging threats
against Merritt could be interpreted as threats-even if the statements had been
made. He was told that we always caution our informants against disclosing
themselves because we are aware that some people might want to exact retribu-
tion against them for having helped the FBI. The statement that we would hate
to have Merritt found in the Potomac with cement galoshes is the type of thing
that would be an admonishment against his self-disclosure becauseSome of
his friends might seek revenge. Herington told Stout that it was ridiculous
to believe that any FBI Agent would threaten to kill a former informant. It was
also noted that with regard to the second allegation about the prosecution on
checks, this does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a threat either since
it was obvious that Merritt's surfacing himself with a lot of publicity might
cause the victims of those checks to urge a current prosecution.

Stout said that he took everything Merritt said with a grain of salt.

Stout, of course, was formerly with the Police Foundation and says
- he knows Mr. Kelley personally. He has generally been pro law enforcement in
our limited dealings with him During this conversation he said that he
sympathized with the law enforcement's position in dealing with informants
but that he had been assigned to write a story, which he would have to do. He
said he didn't really think that what he wrote would hurt the FBI and indicated
that the story should be forthcoming within the next several days.
