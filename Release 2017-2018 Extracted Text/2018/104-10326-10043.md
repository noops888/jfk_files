WILL ENUMERATE THE THE UNFAVORABLE REACTION THE|
HAD TO RECENT DISCLOSURES AND AGENCY REQUESTS FOR PERMISSION TO -
DISCLOSE INFORMATION PASSED TO US J. ‘ ireestalaer:
EXAMPLES WE INTEND TO CITE INCLUDE THE (DUTY TO WARN ISSUE WHERE) :
WERE ADAMANT ABOUT NOT GIVING PERMISSION TO
DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION BECAUSE
J|ABOUT THE BOOK PUBLISHED BY A FORMER AGENCY
EMPLOYEE THAT ALLUDES TO.
‘THE -RECENT (DEMARCHE] EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT A FORMER
AGENCY OFFICER ALLEGEDLY DISCLOSED CLASSIFIED :

RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT OUR U.S.
DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION AND WHETHER THE LEGISLATION PROVIDES
ES_ ABOUT NOT DISCLOSING: INFORMATION. PASSED ‘TO: US

\ | WITHOUT EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION. FROM SUCH
tH CWE" WILL ALSO MAKE REFERENCE TO A RECENT
APPROACH | ] ASKING FOR OUR OKAY IN THEIR e

DECLASSIFYING SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS, AND OUR STRONGLY-WORDED
RESPONSE DENYING PERMISSION AND ARGUING THAT SUCH DISCLOSURE WOULD
BE A BREACH OF TRUST.

ict 4. IN ORDER TO BOLSTER OUR POSITION WITH THE<JFK>BOARD
REQUEST STATION}OBTAIN A HARD COPY OF THE EMARCHE} ON
THE DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION THAT TACHED T' MO.
WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH HARD COPY EVIDENCE ILL .

BOLSTER OUR ARGUMENT SIGNIFICANTLY. WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE
ACTUAL TEXT OF THIS |\DEMARCHE] IN HQS..

5. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE DO NOT WANT. EVEN TO
APPROACH ABOUT DECLASSIFYING THE AFOREMENTIONED
DOCUMENTS. WE-HOPE OUR MEMO CONVINCES THE BOARD THAT, IN LIEU OF
RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS, SUMMARIES THAT OMIT ALL REFERENCE

WILL SUFFICE. B

6. FYI: OUR FALLBACK POSITION IF ‘THE BOARD TURNS DOWN THE
(CONCEPT OF SUMMARIES, IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT RELEASE THE
DOCUMENT, EVEN IN REDACTED FORM, WITHOUT]

PERMISSION; FURTHER, THAT IF WE SEEK AND ARE DENIED PERMISSION AND
iz ‘THE BOARD NONETHELESS PROCEEDS WITH THE DECLASSIFICATION, *T WILL
HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH .THE
IN SUM, OUR GOING-IN POSITION IS WE WANT TO
AVOID RAISING THE SPECTER |THAT THE AGENCY MAY
HAVE TROUBLE PROTECTING THEIR SECRETS. IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN
OUR. INITIAL PROPOSAL AND INSISTS WE SEEK’ = PERMISSION TO

DECLASSIFY, WE WILL DO SO. IN SUCH AN PEOPLE
BELIEVE A STRONGLY-WORDED DOCUMENT FROM THE! -EFUSING
WOULD PROBABLY PERSUADE THE BOARD NOT TO RELEASE THE

DOCUMENT. WE WILL KEEP YOU ADVISED ON HOW THIS IS
PROGRESSING AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER GRIST FOR THE MILL AS
-WE_CRAFT OUR MEMO TO THE BOARD AS WELL AS THE TEXT OF THE
DEMARCHE) ON DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION.
