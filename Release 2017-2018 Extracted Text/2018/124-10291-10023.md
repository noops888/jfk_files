1978 VESIT OF PRESIDENT JIWMY CARTER. ALTHOUGH THERE 15 SECRET
A TENDENCY TO BLAME THE UNITED STATES FOR VENEZUELA'S CURRENT

FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH

MIGHT TAKE PLACE WOULD BE AIMED AT PRESIDENT CARTER, BUT

RATHER THEY WOULD BE STAGED DURING THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT

TO EITHER EMBARRASS THE CURRENT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OR To

FURTHER DRAMATIZE THE CAUSE BEING ADVOCATED. (SOURCE : A

STAFF OFFICER OF THIS AGENCY.)

3. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES RECOGNIZE THIS
SITUATION AND EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE UNPLEASANT, ANTI-
VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT INCIDENTS DURING PRESIDENT CARTER'S
CARACAS VISIT. VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THESE INCIDENTS
WILL DEAL WITH CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND GOVERNMENT
CORRUPTION. THE SECURITY FORCES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ANY
SITUATION THAT ARISES, THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE. (SOURCE:

RAIDS ON MILITARY POSTS, HAVE TAKEN OVER SMALL TOWNS FOR A LIMITED

13. THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY IS LARGE, WELL-ESTABLISHED
AND INFLUENTIAL. FURTHERMORE, IT CURRENTLY FEELS BETRAYED AND
REJECTED BY BOTH THE USG AND THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT. IN
THE FORMER CASE, THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED BY TH
uUSG"S EXPANDED FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.
WITH REGARD TO THE GOV, THE EXILES HAVE COME TO DISTRUST
THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION WHICH THEY FEEL HAS UNJUSTLY
HARRASSED THE COMMUNITY SINCE THE 6 OCOBER 1976

IV. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES

21. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES, ESPECIALLY DISIP,
HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY PERSONAL RIVALRIES AMONG THEIR TOP
OFFICIALS. PART OF DISIP’S DIFFICULTIES ARISE FROM CHARGES
OF MISCONDUCT IN THE HANDLING OF THE ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN
IN THE EASTERN STATES. ANOTHER PART STEMS FROM MUTUAL DISTRUST
AND BACKBITING AMONG ITS LEADERS. DISIP'S EFFICIENCY, WHICH UNDER
NORMAL CONDITIONS IS NONE TOO GOOD, IS NOT UP TO ITS USUAL
STANDARD. DISIP DIRECTOR GIMENEZ HAS VOICED HIS LACK OF
FAITH IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF DISIP OFFICERS AND HAS
EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE FOR A RETURN TO THE OLDER, MORE EXPERIENCED
OFFICIALS. (SOURCE: [a VENEZUELAN PROFESSIONAL man WITH CONTACTS @)

23. THE DIRECTORATE OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE (DIM)
HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN RECENT REORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL
PROBLEMS AND IS GENERALLY STAFFED WITH CAREER MILITARY OFFICERS
ON ROTATIONAL TOURS. DIM'S OPERATIONS IN THE EASTERN STATES ARE
CURRENTLY UNDER. INVESTIGATION WHICH MAY, HOWEVER, CAUSE THIS
