Memo, Sec. of State Herter to President Eisenhower

"the United States would immediately take political

action to remove Trujillo from the Dominican Republic

as soon

as a

suitable successor can be induced to

take over with the assurance of U. S. political,

economic, and -- if necessary -- military support."

Memo, CIA to J. C. King

"c.

Would it provide a small number of sniper

rifles or other devices for the removal of key

Trujillo people from the scene?"

"Providing the arms as requested would contribute

significantly toward this

end."

"2.

Delivery of approximately 300 rifles and

pistols together with ammunition and a supply of

grenades, to secure cache on the South shore of the

island,

about 14 miles east of Ciudad Trujillo.

"b.

Delivery, to the same cache described above,

of an electronic detonating device with remote

control features, which could be planted by the

dissidents in such manner as to eliminate certain

key Trujillo henchmen.

This might necessitate train.

"the proposed actions would not, of themselves

bring about the desired result in the near

future lacking some decisive stroke against Trujillo

himself."

LIBPARY

Special Group Minutes

"Mr. Merchant explained the feeling of the Depart-

ment

of State that limited supplies of small arms

and other material should be made available for

dissidents inside the Dominican Republic. Mr. Parrott

said that we believe this can be managed securely by

CIA, and that the plan, would call for dadad trans-.;"

Memo, Special Group Meeting

"the CIA did not have in mind a quick elimination of Castro"

Special Group Minutes

"there was a general discussion as to what would be the

effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and Raul Castro and Che

Guevera should disappear simultaneously."

positive action against Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara"

must be Cubans.

He felt that, particularly because of the

necessity for simultaneous action, it would have to be

concluded that (such action) is beyond our capabilities."
