CARLOS

MARCELLO

ANTI-RACKETEERING

(00: NEW ORLEANS)

on 10/22/61, PCI JOSEPH HEGEMAN called SA VINCENT

K. ANTLE from New Orleans and said he had met CARLOS MARCELLO

in Baton Rouge, La., at latter's request. PCI said he did

not know MARCELLO personally before this meeting.

MARCELLO was in Real Estate and wanted to meet PCI because

he had heard PCI was in a successful gas and oil enterprise

and had good business connections. PCI said he felt from

talking with MARCELLO that latter

might be influenced to

give some pertinent information concerning his involvements.

PCI said if desired, he could invite MARCELLO to his fort

Lauderdale, Fla., home and try to convince him it would be to

his best interest to meet with FBI representatives and te11

them the truth. PCI said he would not return to Fort

Lauderdale for at least 10 days.

on 10/27/61, PCI called SA ANILE from New York and

said MARCELLO was coming to New York 10/28/61, and that he

would probably see him.

PCI said he expected

to be in Fort

Lauderdale about November 1, and that he would report all

pertinent data regarding MARCELLO that he had learned.

Miami did

not and UACB. wilhnot initiate a meeting with

MARCELLO at Fort Lauderdale home of PCI since Miami does not

know what data MARCELLO has furnished to the New Orleans

office and because it does not know the ramifications of
