Re:

ds. State of Maryland

Dear Mr. Greaney:

This will confirm the fact that after discussions

with the investigating officer and Lieutenant Colonel Miller

of the Montgomery Countv Police Department. a single traffic

citation was issued tol

I charging him

with failure to reduce speed to avoid a collision, which

is a violation of the motor vehicles laws,of the State.

On August 14, 1969, I met with!

_Ind representa-

tives of-your agency at the Wheaton-Glenmont police station

and

signed the traffic citation and posted and

forfeited $18.00, representing a fine of $15.00 and $3.00

costs.

This is equivalent to a conviction, but avoids the

necessity of any Court appearance. When a record of this

conviction is forwarded to the Department of Motor Vehicles

to care:

they will assess three points against

but this

should not result in any action being taken against him by

the Department.

Following conversations with the owner of the

damaged vehicle, MI. James E. Vest, we determined that a

fair and reasonable charge for repairs to his automobile

would be $188.90, and consequently we forwarded to him

by letter of August Il our check in the amount of $189.90,

representing the agreed amount of damage together with

$1.00 for expenses in connection with Notary fees for

the execution of the general release which we prepared.

I enclose herewith the original and one executed

copy of the

general

release, together with a copy of my

letter of August 11 to Mr. Vest, and copies of the two

estimates of damage which Mr. Vest forwared to us.

Mr. Vest was not at all vindictive, and in.

fact indicated he was sorry he had caused

any difficulty, but had summoned the police upon the

advice of an Assistant State's Attorney of Montgomery

County who happened to be a witness to the accident.

Mr. Vest is completely satisfied with the adjustment °7

of his damages, and I explained to him thatl

was charged and elected to forfeit collateral, and I

feel certain that if Mr. Vest had had his way, there

would not have even been a necessity for a charge.

The Montgomery County Police Department was

most cooperative and the police officer is now in pos-

session of sufficient information to satisfy him con-

cerning the disposition which was made.

I am of the opinion that the disposition was

completely favorable, and I am pleased that we were able

to be of some assistancento you in this matter. I believe

I discussed with

that an accident report would

probably have to be filed with the Department of Motor

Vehicles, and he may have attended to this. If not, I

suggest some representative of your office check with

the local police to determine whether an accident report

must be filed in this situation, apd if so, that the same

be prepared and filed on behalf of

07

Inasmuch as nothing further remains to be done

by this office, we are closing our file, and we would

simply request that you issue your check in the amount

of $189.90, made payable to my firm as reimbursement for

payment of damages made to MI. Vest.

I prefer not to

make any charge for professional services rendered in this

particular matter.

with kindest regards?

, I am,

Very truly yours,

waff

Mr. James E. Vest

Dear Mr. Vest:

This will acknowledge receipt of copies of

the repair estimates which you received from Curtis

Chevrolet and Loving Chevrolet, Inc., in the amounts

of$187.49 and $188.90, respectively.

Confirming our

telephone conversation of this afternoon, we understand

you wish to have the repairs made by Loving Chevrolet.

and of course my client has no objection to this. Accord-

ingly, I enclose herewith my check in the amount of

representing payment in fuls for the damage to

your vehiele and $1.00 to cover any expenses for Notary

fee in connection with your execution of the enclosed

release. I am forwarding two copies of the release

with the request that you have the original signed in

the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in

the enclosed self addressed envelope, retaining the

other copy for your files.

This is a standard form of

release used by this office, which I have altered to

exclude any reference to bodily injury since this was

solely a property damage accident. It is only neces-

sary that you have one witness, who can be the Notary.

27

Again, may I offer apologies on behalf of

for the inconvenience caused you.

Very truly yours,

John F. McAuliffe
