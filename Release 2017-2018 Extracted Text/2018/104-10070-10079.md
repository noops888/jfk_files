Control

It is evident from his S/W messages that AMFAUNA-1 derives

great personal satisfaction from his work

against the CAstRo regime.

His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work.

This is believed to be a strong element of control.

There have been

many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 ec do

something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is

believed to be effective.

Production:

JMWAVE records do not show the toral number of AMFAUNA

The figure is at least fifty,

dissemination can be a criterion.

Ill content they have leaned

heavily toward the activities of

insurgent groups, militia movemants,

aviation matters.

There has been a more

recent tendency toward political and

being encouraged by JMWAVE. Evaluations of his production are lacking.

AMFAUNA-1 has been caught

that all is still well are the fact

that he never omits the safety signal that was given him for use in his

the reporting of his agents is consistent with

their access to information.

Whether AMFAUNA-1 is now in danger of being detected, and

the G-2 could double him if they do catch him, are two

questions renaining to be considered.

Taking the second question firet,

that the chances of the G-? running a successful CI

It is also conceivable that the G-2 could use AMFAUNA-l's own interest

ANCUTLER-1 would almostlcertainly have learned, either through his

that something is wrong with AMFAUNA-1.

The risks that AMFAUNA-l is now running are believed to be

considerable.

for one thing, at least ten persons with varying degrees

of his clandestine operations, have been held temporarily

or permanently by the Go?, which is believed to be increasing in

competence as a security force.

For another, AMFAUNA-] takes unnecessar

chances, as by interrogating

new and untested agent (AMFAUNA-4) in

the personal autonobile of his sister-in-law,

by personally trying

to penetrate a restricted area. And for a third, he has some contacts

which can be dangerous to him.

AMCOG-2 knows too much about AMFAUNA-1 for the latter's good.

It is believed that AMFAUNA-l himself is aware that this is a potential-

ly serious security weakness, because he took the trouble to report it

(see paragraph 15al above). The AMCOG operation is itself a fairly

complex one, and wild be analyzed in a separate dispatch. ne

Intelligible answers to some of the questiong raised by this develop-

Why did the RAMIREZ organization not know or the

arrest of Identity-12, one of its own members, which had

occurred at least a month previously?

If the RAMIREZ organization was so poorly informed

about Identity-12, how did they know about AMFAUNA-3, and

why did they think she would be the appropriate person to

give the letter to?

Given the disorganization complained of by the

writer of the letter, and

the fact that all meetings must

have been arranged and held under clandestine conditions,

how to account for the fact that in the maximum of six
