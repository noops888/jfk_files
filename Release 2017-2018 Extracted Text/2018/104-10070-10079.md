ned legally to cuba(

Since then he has built a net
a k 140 S/W messages, from which upwards of

. ty int@lligence disseminations have been made. He is highly

'. motivated for his work and under effective control by JMWAVE. The
quality of his production is, for the most part, very good and improving
although‘he is at times distracted by an understandable interest in
para-military operations, Operationally he is very skillful; however,
he has been known to. take unnecessary risks. There is no reason to
think that he is under hostile control nor that the operation is likely’
in the future to be turned against us. There bei however, the real

risk that he may one day fa]l into a G-2 trap baited with the Escambray
guerrillas. If so, this will be due to the fact that contact with the
guerrill9g was his first assignment and, although he has been re-
directed’to intelligence collection, he sometimes seems to feel that

+ Fe Ins recruiting sub-agents, AMFAUN4~1 relies primarily on his
own judgment and intuition. If he approve of a person, he will
recruit him. “However, he has shown himself to be very cautious in
granting his approval. He has reported two persons whom he does not. ~
completely trust because, while otherwise well qualified, they drink.
too much and are indiscreet. For two other examples, AMBOAel and
LITAU-§ approached him separately and revealed their relationship with
KUBARK, hoping to collaborate.with him; AMFAUNA-1 treated them both 4}
with reserve while he checked them out with JMWAVE. He hae submitted.’ *|
the names of other contacts for checking. In the case of AMFAUNA-4, (Geo~y
whom he recruited without prior checking because time did not permit
it, he put his misgivings in writing: "Right away AMFAUNA-1 arranged
for a personal interview, taking utmost precautions, since we have

s armed forces."

8. Once he has recruited a sub-agent, AMFAUNA=1 manages to keep i
an independent eye on the former's security. On more than one occasion

“he -has reported that one of his sub-agents is under G-2 surveillance,
and that for the time being he is staying away from him.

"9. In general AMFAUNA-1 seems to trust in the efficiency of his
gecurity precautions. On 25 February 1962 he reported that Identity
1 had been caught, but that he was in no danger because he had been

compartmented from her.°tThisyc ntmentas ig jachieved by the use ~
of (five cutouts: AMERUNIE?, ANERUNES 3 ANEADNRELY anbonc Ls and

JA-S, who maintain contact for AMFAUNA-1 with most if not all of
his sub-agents. Chart A, which shows AMFAUNA-1 .in. direct contact with
AMFAUNAS 7 through 13, may be in error on this point. It would be
more in keeping with AMFAUNA-1's known modus operandi for him to have
cutouts between himself and these sub-agents, “If there is a cutout or
cutouts here, their identity is not yet known. There may also be an
unreported cutout between AMFAUNA-1 and AMFAUNA-4, ~

10. Except for AMFAUNAz4, all the above-mentioned cutouts are
women. Two of his support agents, including his mail drop, are also
women. AMFAUNA-1 has’ not been explicit on this point, but it is ,....;’
believed that he shares his favors between them. “If 80, he has the
best. of cover for his relations with them. It also clarifies the
otherwise puzzling picture of a legal resident of Cuba sleeping ina
different bed edch night. This practice must certainly reduce the
possibility that the C-2 will pick him up for routine questioning.

Communications: |

“11. The bulk of AMFAUNA-1's communications come via S/W. His

ought to be of some value, although JMWAVE has not yet seen

was introduced to him by Identity-13,0] For a further

discussion of thia matter, see paragraph 56 below.

ly defected. AMFAUNA-~1's last mention of her was on 15 .
November when he reported that she had given him a map show-
ing artillery installations on the south coast of Las Villas,

It is possible that AMFAUNA-1 has broken contact with her,
but since he has not reported having done so it is considered ¢

more likely that she remains his cutout to
who are known to be still reporting?

(1) AMFAUNA-18: He was recruited in March 1962,

that the two children have different matronymics, that neither of them
is his wife's last name, and that all three dependents have different
addresses. It is agcumed that this is his third wife. Since AMFAUNA-1
has never mentioned her in any of his S/W correspondence, it is also
assumed that she has gone the way of her tyvo predecessors.

20, It is evident from his S/W messages that AMFAUNA-1 derives
great personal satisfaction from his work against the CASTRO regime.
Hia connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work.
This is believed to be a strong element of control. There have heen
many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 tc do
something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is
believed to be effective.

Previous History of the Operation - January to May 1961:

21. AMFAUNA-1 was engaged in some form of clandestine work against
the CASTRO regime as early as(December 196904 As with so much else in
this operation, details are lacking, but it is known that he already

35. At some time during the period June to November 1961, AMFAUNA~
began collaborating with AMBOA-1. The origin of this collaboration is
not known, but it appears that the initiative was taken by AMBOA-1.
AMFAUNA-1 reported that she had revealed to him the fact that she has
a channel of S/W communication, to KUBARK, and that she had claimed to
be a friend of the widow of AMCUSP-1)9l AMFAUNA-1 asked JMWAVE to

85. Identity-55 and Identity-56 were mentioned briefly as active
during the period from December 1961 to Apzil 1962. The former had
been a contact of AMRUNG- Jol and seems to have gone into hiding; in any
case, nothing m orted on him. The latter was an agent
of AMFAUWA-1 in in January 1962 he was in niding and
awaiting a chance M«

46. AMFAUNA-11 remained active durin, this period, anc AMFAUNA~9 ,

Production:

4g. JMWAVE records do not show the tecal number of AMFAUNA
reports disseminated since January 1561. Tne figure is at least fifty,
and is believed to be nearer one hunired, if the present frequency. of
dissemination can be a criterion. I content they have leaned
heavily toward the activities of insurgent groups, militia movemants,
location of artillery, and aviation matters. There has been a more
recent tendency toward political and economic information, which is
being encouraged by JMWAVE, Evaluations of his production are lacking.

Security Analysis:

49, The possibility that AMFAUNA-1 is a double agent is consider-
ed remote. His successful LCFLUTTER, the fact (or what is believed to
be the fact) that his close friend and fellow agent ANCUSP-1) was
executed, and AMFAUNA-1's owi: character and background, allWfargue
against the proposition that he was originally dispatched by the G2.
However, it must be admitted that the LCFLUTTER carpi be beaten.; Also
that there is no proof, other than the fact that aogipecit wife is
in the JMWAVE area and behaving like a widow, that AKCUSP=1. was really
executed. There is documentary evidence plin the formoof a letter
written by a fellow prisoner to AMCUSP-1'9) widow, that he was held
in prison in March and April 1961. However, the person who identif,

50. Similarly, all that ia known about AMFAUNA-1's background
comes from AMFAUNA-1's own statements embodied in his PRQ Part I. No.
confirmation of this information has ever been obtained. From this
point of view thera is no guarantee that AMFAUNA-1 ie what he claims
to be. For all the proof to the So Gamn available to JMWAVE, he

$1, These points are listed for the sake of ccmpleteneso, but >
littl@limportance is attached to them. Tht known fact that QUANTUM-62,

was not a(______‘|Communist. And an unusually extensive independent
view has''!paen obtained of. AMFAUNA-1's operations through the reports
and debriefings of eight of his egents who have either escaped to or

| Identity-26, and Identity-29, have all corcirmed parte of AMFAUNA-1's

with AMFAUNA-1, and AMFAUNA-2's telephone conversations with ICUTLER=}}
provide a continuing check on the safety #ud whereabouts of AMFAUNA~12.0/

52. For the same reasons, the possibility is heavily discounted
that AMFAUNA-1 has been caught and doubled by the G-2 since his arrival
in Cuba. Additional indications that all is atill well are the fact
that he never omits the safety signal that was given him for use in his
S/W, that his operational activities are consistent with his character
and background, and that the reporting of his agents is consistent with
thejr access to information.

$3, Whether AMFAUNA-1 is now in danger of being detected, and
whether the G-2 could double him if they do catch him, are two
questions remaining to be considered. Taking the second question first,
it is believed that the chances of the G-2 running a successful CI
operation against KUBARK through AMFAUNA-1 are extremely slim. To be
sure, the G-2 has certain weapons that(they could use against AMfAUNA-1.
His father is already fin prison, serving a fifteen-year sentence, an
his mother and two children(are still in Cuba ac potential hostages.
It is also conceivable that the G-2 could use AMFAUNA-1's own interest
in paramilitary operations as a lever by persuading him that KUBARK,
by neglecting to support the insurgent leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ, was
responsible for the latter's death and has demonstrated its indifference
to the fate of the Cuban people. This would all take time, however,
because AMFAUNA-1's reaction to arrest, at ‘east initially, would of,
probably be an attempt tojgmulate his two h«roes, AMCUSP-) and AMRUNG~ D.

$4, The risks that AMFAUNA-1 is now running are believed to be
considerable. for one thing, at least ten persons with varying degrees
of knowledge of his clandeetine operations, have been held temporarily
or permanently by the GS-2, which is believed to be increasing in
competence as a security force. For another, AMFAUNA-1 takes unnecessar:
chances, as by interrogating a new and untested agent (AMFAUNA-4) in
the personal automobile of his sister-in-law, or by personally trying
to penetrate a restricted area. And for a third, he has some contacts
which can be dangerous to him,

55. AMCOG-2 knows too much about AMFAUNA-1 for the latter's good.
It is believed that AMFAUNA-1 himself is aware that this is a potential-
ly serious security weakness, because he took the trouble to report it
(see paragraph 15al above). THe AMCOG operation is itself a fairly
complex one, and will be analyzed in a separate dispatch. The, aspects
of it which bear,cn the AMFAUNA operation are that AMCOG-2 and(her @
prother}aMcoc. 3) are (close relatives of a very prominent anti-Communist \

Cuban politician) and that they are widely known, both in Cuba and in

prosecution for actanagainst it, ie a matter for wonder. It hase been
rumored that (the oldpolitician\has a blackmail hold over Fidel CASTRO
by virtue of ‘nis posseseion of Very damaging information about CASTRO.
There may be some substance to this rumor, Aa a young student SASTES
is balieved to have committed criminal acts, and the (old politician
would have been in the best possible position at the time to obtain
proof of tham. This might well explain wry the family enjove immunity
today.

56. It would seem, thougr, that an aler* and competent security
service, which the G-2 shows eigns of becoming, if it is enjoined from
arresting and prosecuting an espionage suspect, would at least try to
control and moniter his operations by penetrating them, It is there-
fore a cause for speculation that, in February 1962, an important
officer of the Cuban Army (AMFAUNA-4)% allegedly desirous of defecting,
was introduced by Identity-13 to AMCOG-2, and a matter for deep concern
that AMCOG-2 passed the lead along to AMFAUNA~1 who accepted it with-
out any prior checking and actually held his first meeting with the
would-be defector in an automobile tracea’le to AMFAUNA~2. Since
then, it has been observed that reports avd sub-sources offered by
AMFAUNA-&8 are absorbing an increasing amount of AMFAUNA~1's time. The
military manuals endjcocuments turned over by AMFAUNA-4, and sent ‘to
Headquarters via the (QUANTUNe and the G@iaarid, Station have not yet been
seen by JMWAVE, so it is not yet known whether AMFAUNA-u's production
can be given a sufficiently high evaluation to allay the doubts raised
by the manner of his recruitment. Headquarters is asked to advise on
this as soon as possible, and to provide traces on AMFAUNA-4, =

57. The other potentially dangerous contacts are, as might be
expected, in the field of para~military acpiities in tovember 1267-6

59. As mentioned in paragraph 1b rhove, ODIBEX has some kind of
interest in ANFAUNA-3, and it may be that thelr files contain
gible a’ re to some of the questions raised by this develop-
ment. For instance:

a, why did the RAMIREZ organization not know or the +
arrest of Identity-12, one of ite own members, which nad
occurred at least a month previously?

b. If the RAMIREZ organization was so poorly informed
about Identity-12, how did they know about AMFAUNAs3, and
why did they think she would be the appropriate person to
give the letter to?

c. Given the disorganization complained of by the
writer of the letter, and the fact that all meetings must
have been arranged and held under clandestine conditions,
how to account for the fact that in the maximum of six
days between 28 May and 3 June when AMFAUNA-1 reported
the developments by S/W, something like the following
sequence of events must,have taken place:

Future Plans

60. It is difficult if not impossible to give an operation of
this complexity the support and direction it needs, when the only
communication with the@rincipal agent is by secret writing. There
is neve: nough room in an S/W message for both the positive intelligen
reporting and the supporting operational details, and it is the lattes
that suffer. S/W communication algo inevitably involves a time lag
which, in the case of this operation, has sometimes run as high as

61. Ao a first step toward opeading up communications, it de
planned to find another accommodation address in the JMWAVE area for
AMFAUNA-1's use which can be expected to function without the delays
that have been oxperianced recently. Because of the importance and
urgency of some of AMFAUNA-1'a intalligonce veporte, consideration

62. AMFAUNA}-1 will be instructed to break off contact with
ANCOG-2, and to cease interesting himself in the affaira of the
Escambray. As for AKFAUNA-4, it is feared that AMFAUNA~1 ie already
80 deaply involved with him that, if he war not a bona fide defector,
the damage hae already been done. Neverth.less, AMFAUNA-1 will be
warnad of the potentialitiss of this situa.ion so that he ca. be
pre d to go into hiding if it should devslop badly. Specific
military requirements will be sent to AMFAIA-1 for AMFAUNA-4 to
help in establishing his value as a source. Also for the improvement
of the security of the operation, AMFAUNA-1 will be told to stop taking

sonal and unnecessary risks such as his penetration of a restricted
ache

63, For the continued improvement of production, political and
economic requirements will be sent to him. AMFAUNA-1 is very
responsive to requirements, and has already developed sources and
informants in the political and economic areas in response to
instructions from JMWAVE, It is believed that an increased output
of higher-priority intelligence can be expected from this operation.
