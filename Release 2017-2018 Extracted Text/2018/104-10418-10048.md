OLTMANS, who previously produced a commentary on the murder of
KENNEDY is still working on this matter in cooperation with

Jim GARRISON. He claims to know who the KENNEDY murderer was.

In connection with this OLTMANS has been the guest of an "oil
millionaire" in Texas.

According to OLTMANS he was invited there because of "his know-
ledge of the affair" and the fact that he would be able to act

as a medium to bring the facts to the world. At his request Jim
GARRISON has provided him with a body guard while working on

this matter.

In Texas it appeared to hhm that the group who had financed KENNEDY'
murder had had a deep seated quarrel and had fallen into two
groups. Some details regarding this affair have come to light and
it is seriously being considered to bring them to the public via
a television broadcast.
