Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known

to this Agency,

the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JAVE.

On

numerous occasions since

at least the early 1960's

HEMMING

had clained agency affiliation when in fact there has bes-

none.

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING clained such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

100g-time record of falsenteriate notoriety aho also has a

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

In

the late 1950's HENNING and STURGIS, both forner U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionnent with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a

group of mercenaries

for Caribbean and

Central American

activities which he named the International

Anti-Comnunist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this

"Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HE MING.

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMING, you are referred to attachments to instant

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT,

and an' extract from

published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'etat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F

Kennedy

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

JI. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jin"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNED'

and that members

of this unit vere connected with CIA

GARRISON

shortly thereafter dropped his interest

in HALL, but it is

so after Gerald Patrick HEMING
