2. Mr. Helms stated be was familiar with the DRE
situation and desired to work out a slightly different
way of doing business. He realized there have been ups

and downs'in the relationship and that the Agency vas
nts, but

not lily white in abiding by many of ita conaiti
that many of the changes were due to factors beyond the
re no decisions

Agency's control, Ke continued there
as yet made by the U.S. Governmeat regarding the future
handling of-the Castro probles. The primary items being
considered at the present time both in Xew York and
Washington were the rewoval of the missiles end bonbers
from Cuba ard on-site inspection. Br. Helma fully re-
alized that tho decisions which may come.about.at the con~
clusion of these negotiations will not be decisions ac~
coptable to the DRE. If a tixe comes when the DR feels
their course of action is no longer compatible with 0.8.
policy, Ur. elas wanted to make thia polot clear, the
DRE should be frank and honest and so state ate He did
not want to be devious about our relationship, and he wanted
to develop the relationship "as & reanonable collaboration".
3. Mr. Helma informed tocha he waa changing the Agency
contact for the DRE in Missi. He also stated the new con-

tact would be able to cone to Mr, Helms for any clarification

needed regarding the relationship. As for a future
operational program for the DRE, Mr. Helms stated he pre-
gently did not. know what this would bo. Mr. Rocha stated
that in all honesty he could not. guarantee that under sll
circumstances the DRE would be able to continue the re-
lationship, for a change in U.8. policy toward coexistence
would differ from what the DRE believes is a duty to their
country and he ams the Secretayy General to his men this
would mean a break in our relationship as they felt they
must continue fighting Castro in any form possible. He
did give Hr. Helms his word of honor he would inform his
contact or Mr, Helms when the DRE felt thoy could zo longer
cooperate with the Agency because of the difference in what
they belioved in and U.S. policy. Rocha claimed they were
anxious to cooperate with the Agency, and it was foolish
to think that without Agency support they could continue
their present level of activity. Ee in fact stated that 60
to 90 per cent of their activity would cease if Agency funds
wers discontinued. This would bs suicide, and according to
Rocha thia he did not want provided a satisfactory arrange-
ment could be reached. q

4. Mr. Lassa asked what they could expect regarding
their future orientation and plana. Rocha chimed in and
etated that this was one of the difficulty a_under which

were or what was expected of them. He added that in
order to direct his own organization, he gust be aware of

the direction in which wervere moving before he could make

_ the proper decisions in his orgenization, Mr. Helms

answered "We will tell you the truth and what the score

ia when we know it ourselves". He also warned then that
when this inforsation is divulged, it would be in strict-
est confidence on e#"¥YI basis and sot for the press or

the rest of the exile community. Mr. Helms sddod that on
this question he would be very honest with them and either
tell them: a. I don’t kaow; >. I won't tell you: oc, Papel
tell you, and give them the information they required for
proper orlentstion. Hr. Helas reiterated that regarding
this type of inforsatioa they must keop ‘sipped up. Accerd=

DRE and im bis absence efther Kanuel Salvat or Jose Laos

would be the alternate points of contact,

6. ur, Helms stated there wera two elements he ~

would like to clarify:

a. The system of kickbacks used by the DRE.
Rocha way aot familiar with the tern’kiekbach but
after a short explanation explained that the DRE

é did ask their members to sive s certain percentage

of their salary depending on what they can o#fford

for a general fund from which the organization pays
for such items as the Agency does not Zinance. One
of these itens te publication of “The Cuban Report”,
certain work in latin America (not specified) for
which the Agency will not pay, and a very important
itempthe mipport of some of their People and families
coming out of Cuba. Rocha claimed this was voluntary.

Db. . Pinances--ir. Helms desired to know if they
xXept scee system of books, dncludinghopa erpanses
and salaries for their Latin Aserican operations,
and if so who kept their books. Rocha anewered they
did keep books and added they had a full time member’
of the D&E who was a trained accountant in charge of

thie departasnt of their organization, kr. Helms

suggested that as finances are a technical and

difficult matter ‘to: Beep close tabs on, the Agency

could, if. Rocka so desired, holp by providing a

finance techaictanvect up a set of books for the

DRE, Rocha fully agreed with the merit of this

suggestion.

7. Mr. Helms again aosured Rocha and Lasa that with
regard to the future, he would let them know as scon as
be himself knew what it would be. Rocha asked how long
ir. Kelas thought this would be. Mr. Holma stated this
ras somewhat of a hypothetical question but estimated
that the presont meetings, conversations, and negotiations
would possibly take as long as 4 mouth. Er. Belms atatod
he realized that wilitary operations and possibly some of
their propaganda would depend on our future course, but
he wanted them to understand that there will always be need -
for good, specific, detailed information which the DRE can
contribute, According to Mr. Hola, "We need it; you can
contribute it; we'll use it." Mr, Helms added he realized
there were riska iavolved in collecting iuformation, but
he did not want Rocha to misunderstand the value of it,
Mr. Helms also cautioned Rocha and Lasa not to get impatient
over what may appear to be lack of use of their information,

but to give the Agoncy a chance to chock it out.



8. Mr. Helwss added thore was ono other point ef
utmoat importance,and that waa,that if in the future the
DRE desired or wanted to have a press conference or desired
to appear on TY, "Let us know about it". Mr. Helms etated
he didn't want to tie their hands, and he. intended to deal '
with them as responsible wen, but, “Give us @ fair warding”.
Mr. Helms did not want tha DRE to thik we desired to tell
thes what they can or can not do, but he felt it was An
their interest to get our reaction on such matters. Mr,
Helms added, "You, Mr. Rocba, are a responsible man. I
ama responsible aan, Let's do business in a mature manner.”
ir, Roche fully agreed.

®. wr, Rocha thon introduced the eubject of "The Cuban
Report”, the DAE weekly newsletter. He said the sevaletter
wan sest to the presa, seuntora, congressmen, the White
House, and other people in the U.8. He wanted to know how
Mr, Relma felt about this publication. Ur. Holas wanted
to know if the Agency received tho intel) before it was

printed in the newsletter. Er. Rocha answered tint all

| political and military information wae passed to the Agency

beforo it was printed in the newsletter. Mr. Helms ad~
mitted ho hed not read the newsletter and that in the
neantine the DRE could continue it. Once the matter in

studied in more detail, ir. Helms adéed wo may have sone

Scggustions we may wish to discuss. Rocha frackly adaitted
that the DRE felt they neaded the newsletter for their
organization to be able to influence public opinion in the
U.8. To satisfy his own curiesity, ur. Helms asked if
Sezator. Keatingls figures were based om "The Cuban Report",
Rocha ansvered in tho affirmative. -

10. Rocha then asked what the D&E could expect re-
garnting execution of military operations. Mr. Helas in-
formed Recha that. when. they bad & silitary plas to submit
it. The Agency would study 1t and give them an answer.
Mr. Belus added that if an answer was not forthcoulng in
@ reasouablo length of tine, they should agate ask for
the answer from their contact. Mr. Helos assured Rocha of
hia continuing personal interest 1a this relationship end
he wanted Rocha to deal with hia Ageney contatt in Miost

“with this in mind, but he warned Rocks that althovgh this

fe the caso, he did not want the DAs ruoning end runa’on
their contact on mattera they can deal with in Miant. Rocha
understood,

nn As he (Rocha) feared there may have beea certain
Pecececenn cue regarding & request by the “man in charge
ia Riss” on either the 23rd or 24th of october, he felt it

necessary to set forth his positioa. The "man in charge”

‘ sien?



met with Rocha on one of the above dates and aaked for
five mon from the DRE including Rocha and Salvat to be
aafiitrated into Cuba for intelligence purposes. Con
sidering the wilitia in Cuba was on full alert by this
date therefore greatly reducing the chances of success
of much an attempt, Rocha tried to’get further detaile
regarding the operations, but was only told thay would
probably be used to direct artillery fire, Unable to
get more dotaila on what he considered a dangerous and
very risky mission he declined the request. He added he
found it éifficult to ucdorstand the seriousness of such
A request, He felt that bo and Salvat as leaders of
their organization were not available for such aiastonga
and that as head of hia organtzaticn, he did not feel he
could secd his mea to their dexth on such a vaguely de~
fined mission. Rocha continued that he had informed his
men that although the Daz, as an organizatios, would not
take the responsibility for sending them in, they were
free to go if they desired to go on their own. Mr. Helua
stated that, needloas to ssy, proposals and raquesta froa
both parties had to be made in all seriousness.

Rocha desired to diacuss. Rocha ansvered negatively and

leave was taken, é
