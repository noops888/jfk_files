MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director, Plans
FROM: Acting Chie?, SR Division

5 SUBJECT: Contact of Lee OSWALD with a member of Soviet KGB
Assassination Department

. 2 1. According to an intercepted phone cell in Mexico City, Lee OSWALD

~was at the Soviet Enbasay there on 28 September 1963 end sooke with the
Consul, Valeriy Visdimirovich KOSTIKOV’® ‘this was learned when OSWALD culled

the Soviet Embassy on 1 October, ideatifying himself by name and spesking
brokea Russian, stating the above and ‘esking the guard who answered the phone
whether there was “anything new concerning the telegram to Washington.”
Tne guard checked and then told OSWALD that a request had been sent, but
nothing had as yet been received. (MEXI 6453, 9 October 1963) The FBI liaison
officer, Mr. Pappich, told me on 23 November that the Bureau has reason to
believe that OSWALD's visit waa to get Soviet support for a U.S. passport or
visa matter /perhaps the new pessport mentioned in the press articles/.

2. KOSTIXOV is an identified KGB officer. He was a case officer in sn
operation which is evidently sponsored by the KGB's 13th Department ,(respoasible
for sabotage and assessination). This operation, which is controlled by the
Fal under the cryptonym TUMBLEWEED, involved-a German-national resident~of
(Giishons) who was recruited in Europe, and met this year with KOSTIKOV in Mexico
City and shortly thereafter with a imown 13th Department officer, Olég HAYKIN, ~~
in New York. The instructions given TUMBLEWEED by the two officers, (pinpointing
objectives for sabotage) and the circumstances: of their involvement in tho age,
Left no doubt that both of theni vere working for the same KGB component, the
13th.

3. Of course it is not usual for a KGB agent on a sensitive mission to
have such overt contact with a Soviet Embassy. However, we have top secrat
Soviet intelligence documents, describing Military Intelligence doctrine, which
show that very inrportant agents can be met in official installations using a3
cover for their presence there some sort of open business: Vice Admiral

L. BEKRENEV, in a top secret lecture to s Soviet Military Intelligence course
ot Militery-Diplomatic Academy, 1960, said,

"Case officers who use as cover, let us say, the Soviet Trade
Representation, TASS or Sovinfermburo, can use their cover
assignments as backstopping for non-clandestine meetings with
certain agents whose particular activities officially associate

restricted to a minimm both as to plase ani time. Meetings of
this type should be carried out only in exceptional cases with
tested and reliable agents in order to avoid provocation by the
locel counterintelligence service against the Soviet installation
being used as cover. Such meetings are held as a rule in the work
offices of the case officer or of the agent during working hours.

It is necessary that such meetings be conducted naturelly, that

they do not attract the attention of outsiders, end that the receipt
and transmittal of intelligence matters, properly camouflaged, be
carried out discreetly. In setting up such meetings, measures ‘against
tepping mst be taken. One must bear in mind that a meeting with
persons outside official premises and during non-working hours usuelly
signifies a relationship between the two parties that is above and
beyond officiel matters.”

Also, such contect in official installations may be caused by the agent's ow
esrelessness. Again Admirel BEXRENEV speaks:

“Some agents, because of inexperience or because of deliberate
violation of the rules of security through personal
rashness,.... spprosched our case officers et places not stipulated
as operational meeting sites, others telephoried the case officer at
his Soviet installation and discussed personal contact arrangements,
while others still showed up personally at the Soviet installation in
order to contact the case officer."

i 4. I called the above connections to the attention of Mr. Pappich by
phone to his FBI office at 1030 hours on 23 November.


5. I am attaching
1) @ summary of our information on KOSTIKOV; and.

2) all valid background information now available on the work
of the 13th Department of the Foreign Intelligence of the KGB:

‘ a. Extracts from Report on the Soviet State’ Securit;
Service (kop), dated May 1963, based on information from AELADLE.

b. Soviet Use of Kidnapping and Assassination -- Executive

SUBJECT: Valeriy Vladinirovich KOSTIXOV

KOSYIKOV, who was born on 17 Maren 1933 in Moscow, vas
assigned to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City es Viee Consul
cn 19 September 1961.

A fluent Spanish apeaker, he had travelled sbroad at least
three times before thia permanent assignment; moreover, in 1959
KOSTIXOV applied for a visa to accompany Premler Hikita Sergeye~
vich KHRUSHCHEV's party to the United States asa an offielal of
the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but we have no record
of his having come to this country at that tine, KOSTIXoOV
served as an interpreter at international conferences at Madrid
and Bareelona in 1958 and 1959. In late 1959 and early 1960
he attended Soviet exhibitions in Mexico City and Havanay he
is known to have been in Cuba from 6 January to 7 March 1960.

The physical deseription of KOSTIKOV quite accurately fits
that of a Soviet case officer who nearly a year ago met in
Mexico an FBI-controlled double agent, This double agent*s
Sovietcase officer in the United States has been Oleg Danile~
vich BRYKIN of the Thirteenth Department, KGB First Chief
Directorate, oceupying the overt position of translator-trainee,
U-NsSecretariat, Hew York City. BRYKIH was stationed in Kew
York.fity from December 1960 to July of this year.

Since arriving in Mexico, KOSTIKOV 1s known to have travelled
three tines outside the capital: In March 1963 and again for the
first two weeks of September he went to Tijuana, Ensenada, and
Mexicali, ostensibly for the purpose of purchasing cotton. The
U.S. Department of State, however, has reportad that during
these triya KOSTIKOV met local representatives of Movimento
Liveration National and Central Compesina Indevendienta, both
large Communist front organizations. In addition, according to
PBI sources, KOSTIKOV was.accompanied on the September trip by
Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEW “dna he contacted in Ensenada several
persons including Communist sympathizers who previously had been
associated with Soviet officials stationed in Mexico City.

ALFERYEV, 8 PRAVDA correspondent in Mexico, was in close
contact with Cuban diplomats and local Communist leaders during
a February 1962 visit to Quito.
