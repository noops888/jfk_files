FROM:

Acting Chief, SR Division

SUBJECT:

Contact of Ice OSHALD with a nember of Soriet KGB

Assansination Department

1. According to an Intercepted pbone call in Mexico City, Lee OSKALD

was at the Soviet Enbassy there on 28 September 1963 and spoke with the

Consul, Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTINOV!? This was learned When OSWAID called

the Soviet Embassy on 1 October, Identilying himself by sane and speaking

broken Russian, stating the above and isking' the guard who answered the phone

whether there was "anything new concerning the telegram to washington."

The guard checked and then told OSAID that a request had been sent, but

nothing had as jet been received. (MEXI 6453, 9 October 1963) The FBI liaison

officer, Mr. Pappich, told me on 23 lovenber that the Bureau has reason to

believe

that OSMID'a visit was to get Sovlet support for a U.S. pasabort or

visa matter [perhaps the new passport mentioned in the press articles/.

2. KOSTINOV is an Identified KC officer. He was & case officer in ar

operation walch 1s evidently sponsored by tha kha's 13t Department (raspoaible

for sabotage and assasination). This operation, which is controlled by the

F3I under the cryptonyn TUELIVERD, Involved a Cernan-national resident of

(Oklahoma) who was recruited In Europe, and met this year with KOSTIKOV in Mexico

City and shortly thereafter with a known 13th Department officer, Oleg Barkil,

In New York.

The instructiona given TUMBLEWIND by the two officers, (piapointing

objectives for sabotage) and the circumstances of their involvement in tho case,

left no doubt that both of then vere working for the sane KGB component, the

13th.

3. Of course 1t 1a not usual for & K3 agent on a sensitive mission to

have such overt contact with a Soviet Embassy. However, we have top secigt

Soriet Intelligence documents, describing Military Intelligence doctine, which

show that very important agents can be net in official installations u31hg 23

I. ENCHHEY, in & top secret lecture to a Soviet Military Intelligence course

at MIlftary-Diplomatic Acadeny, 1960, said,

Representation, TASS or Sovinformburo, can use their cover

certain agents bose particular activities officially assoctate

them with the previously mentioned soviet Institutions. However,

such non-clandestine meetings within a legal residency should be

restrleted to a minimm both as to place and time. Meetings of

this type should be carried out only in exceptional cases with

tested and rollable agents in order to avoid provocation by the

local counterintelligence cervice against the Sovlet Installation

being uned as cover. Such meetings are hold as a rule in the work

offices of the case officer or of the agent during working hours.

It Is necessary that such meetings be conducted naturally, that

they do not attract the attention of outsiders, and that the receipt

and tranmittal of intellipence matters, properly camouflaged, be

carried out discretly. In setting up such metings, meanres agatast

algnifies a relationship between the two parties that te above and

beyond offiela? matters."

Also, such contact In offictal Installationa my be caused by the agent's own

carelessess. Agin Adniral BERNIEV speaks:

"Some agents, because of inexperience or becane of deliberate

violation of the rules of seourity through peculler pervonal

raahness,..., approached our case offleers at places not stipulated

as operational meeting sites, others telephoned the case officer at

his soviet installation and discused persone. contect artengents,

while otbers still showed up personally at the Soviet Installation 1n

order to contact the case officer."

I called the above connections to the attention of ler. Fappich by

phone to his FBI Office at 1030 hours on 23 lovenber.
