MEMORANDUM FOR: The Review Staff
VIA : Deputy Director for Administration

SUBJECT : Senate Select Committee Request
(Jack Anderson)

1. Reference is made to a request from The Honorable
Howard H. Baker, Jr., United States Senate, (Review Staff
75-3115) for clarification regarding a missing copy of a black
briefing notebook concerning the surveillance of Mr. Jack
Anderson. Reference is further made to a previous memorandum
from the Director of Security (0S 5 8665) dated 2 October 1975,
which responded to several questions posed by Senator Baker !
concerning Mr. Jack Anderson. :

2. The black briefing folders referred to by Senator Baker 1
were prepared shortly before the Office of Security initiated !
surveillance coverage of Mr. Anderson and his associates. At
the time of their original preparation, a.total of six (6) black
briefing notebooks were created. These six black briefing note-
books were labeled as follows: Headquarters one of three;
Headquarters two of three; Headquarters three of three; Wash-
ington Field Office one of three; Washington Field Office two fe
of three; and Washington Field Office three of three. The three —
Headquarters copies were maintained in Headquarters while the
three field office copies were retained by the Office of Security's
Washington Field Office.

5. The six briefing notebooks were created for the sole
purpose of maintaining a ready reference by both Headquarters
and the Washington Field Office from which to brief those Agency
employees involved regarding the background and status of the
Jack Anderson case. It is extremely important to note that the
six briefing folders were intended to remain as exact: duplicates
of one another, and when created they were duplicates. As the
