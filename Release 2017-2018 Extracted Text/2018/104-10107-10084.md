2. It was decided to start the debriefing from
earliest contact with the FBI, which occurred in Boston some time
in 1950, and proceed chronologically covenia subsequent
move to_New York eCity, then =r his employment with the law

firm of which was followed in 1957 by
the formation of the law firm of ex
Subsequently we discussed his employment with CIA, which
involved his disengagement from the New York law firm and
cover for his various trips to (Africa) We repeatedly stressed
his contacts with Herbert Itkin over the years 1955 through 1967.

3, It was considered that naa a very difficult task
if he intended to conceal or deceive the Agency about his relation-
ships with Herbert Itkin. This conclusion was reached since

ould not anticipate what information was available to
the debriefers?3[_____—sdwas advised that Mr. Greene was from

the Office of Security, which carried with it the inference that
he had been privy to all the repor (Cb gave to the FBI,
Roberts was told that I had dealt with Mr. Hogan's office, the
New York District Attorney, and Mr. Morgenthau, the United
States Attorney for the Southern District_of New York, and had
talked with Herbert Itkin personally0} was fully cooper-
ative during the entire debriefing and did not hesitate to discuss
any topics.

4, We concluded that has not been involved in any
of Itkin's illegal activities since! has been an employee of
CIA, It is my opinion that is ah individual with a strong
sense of dedication to principles’so long as they result in what he
considers a worthwhile sense of accomplishment. I think it is
significant to mention this assessment since does not give
the impression of having been motivated solely by monetary rewards
in any of his activities. This lack of concern for money was dis-
turbing during certain phases of the debriefing because oa.
was rather vague about the amount of income he received from the

law firm of { 6 He stated that he used
a drawing account and only took what was needed for his living
expenses?’ gives the impression of being a proud individual

who is not prone to admit to his personal deficiencies. The
(LBGLOBE files contain several references to admonitions given
by station representatives to for non-achievement in the
operational field. Althoug! did not allude to these
admonitions voluntarily, he “did discuss them when asked,

5. It was our feeling that{ did not discuss with

Herbert Itkin his employment with CIA, nor did he discuss with
Itkin his earlier reporting activities to the FBI.03} was
not aware of Itkin's relationship to CIA and did not know of
Mario Brod's affiliation with CIA,

6, After the debriefing had been concluded, )was
told of the possible exposure of his employment with CIA by
Itkin's defense counsel, F, Lee Bailey, should Itkin be tried in
the New York state court.23 appeared to be genuinely
disturbed and expressed bitter feelings toward Itkin since he

te


feels that such exposure could prevent him from performing
future operational assignments. He is enthusiastic about his
future assignment to and is hopeful that circumstances
will permit him to purste’his operational tasks in the very

near future,

7 Mr. left Frankfurt for the night of
21 February and was told to continue with his disengagement

plans as his departure from had already,been announced
to his local contacts. It was suggested that{ take a boat oF
from to Marseille. After his arrival in Marseille, {

was to proceed to Austria and take a ski vacation which is con-
sistent with earlier vacation plans when he traveled from
to Austria during the month of March for skiing in previous

years. Roberts has been instructed to remain in contact with

8. On 24 February 1969, I discussed with Mr. Davidov

Murphy, (Chief of Station, the possible exposure of
in the event Herbert Itkin is tried in_the,New York state court.
I explained how had been al of Itkin but as a
result of our debriefing in Frankfurt we had concluded that

was not involved with illegal activities with Itkin since

has been employed by CIA. Mr. Murphy appreciated
being briefed _on the complicated case but indicated that he was
anxious for[ to arrive in for his operational assign-
ment in view of the priority need for his services in penetrating

certain leftist organizations. Mr. Murphy felt that if Headquarters
was considering a cooling off. period for of approximately
three or four months lurphy would hope that ould

spend this time in establishing himself with the target
community and not have any station contacts, Mr. Murphy
understands that this decision of necessity must be made at
Headquarters, but that he as Chiet of ee eS does not

feel that circumstances as they exist today represent a compromise
of such magnitude that would preclude operational assignment
