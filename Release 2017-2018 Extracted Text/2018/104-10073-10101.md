AMYAUNA-14 replied that this was very logical

to public tumbling on the subject.

73.

When ANFAUNA-14 arrived at AMCOG-3's house at about 2000 hours

on 15 November 1963 for the regular Friday night supper, he took her

aside and said he wanted to speak to her privately later.

At about

There he told her that he had received

orders that she was to leave Cuba the following week.

He said that

preciso instructions were to come on 16 and 17 November, so he made

lunch date with her for Sunday noon at his house.

Bunday afternoon in AMCOG-3's house, AMCOG-3 told her that she

She said that she did not want to.

ANCOQ responded that this was an order.

He said that the DsE would

probably arrest her again soon, and for her own safety and that of others

she must leave.

He added that there were others who were to leave too,

whose departure had been made conditional upon her own.

ANFAUNA-14 asked whether ANCUTLER? were one of these other

On Monday morning, 18 Novemlor, AMTAUNA-14 dreased aa she had

been Instructed, and stufted a pair of slacke and sneakers into the

traw bandbag which she had been told to curry.

At 1300 hours she left

her office and proceeded on foot to the coiner of Atares and Arango in

Reparto Luyano, arriving there at 1400 hours. Here she exceeded her

Instructions,

waiting for ANCUTLER-2 not five minutes but fifteen. She

then walked vory slowly toward Calzada

Luyano, hoping that AVCUTLER-2

might overtake har.

Thie consumed another ten minutes, and by the time

mhe reached the Calzada Luvano it was too late for her to walk the ro

maindor of the distance, so she took a taxi.

79, AMTAUNA-14 discharged the taxi one block before theParque de

In Virgen del Camino and walked the rest of the way.

She went to the

shrine whore she prayed for a few minutes, and then

sat on a bench

from which she could see the whole park.

80.

At 1510 hours & 1954 Buick taxi arrived at the park.

The

driver stayed in the car, and two men - a colored

man and a

fair-haired

man - got out and walked around for about ten minutes.

Finally they

approached her and gave the challenge, to which she gave the correct

response.

One of the men then said simply "Follow me".

They took her

back to

the taxi and put her in the back seat with one

of the men, the

other two riding in front.

81. • They headed out of the city.

When the reached the Carretera

de Varadero, one of the men asked her politely if she would mind keeping

her eyes directed down toward the floor and not look out the window.

Bhe rode this way for about two hours.

By then it was dark, and she was

told she could look up again.

She took advantage of the opportunity to

change into her slacke and sneakere.

82.

Finally the car stopped, and she and her two escorts got out.

They walked a long time.

At one point, whistle signals were exchanged

with soneone in the darkness, and two other men appeared, one of whom

They now reached the mangrove and began to walk through water.

At one point their guide became briefly lost,

but found his way again

almost immediately.

When they came to the open water, one of the guides

rent forward and signalled.

The boat came in in response to the signal.

The boat proceeded out to an unidentified key. The crew con

over it to forma camouflage cover. There they went to sleep.

The following day, 19 November, was spent at this spot.

'A

during the day. At night the boat put out

The waves were enormous, and. AMFAUNA-14 was terribly

monsick. The boat remained at the rendezvous point until 1045 hours,

with ArAUNA l4 pleading for the crew to return to land, saying she

would rather be shot than remain so seasick.

the ship was seen approaching.

AMFAUNA-14 was taken into the sick bay where she was given a pill, a

From the moment she stepped into the boat on 18 November, until

she was hauled out by the armpite on 21 November, AMFAUNA-14 never left

the boat.

Her side and logs were bruised from the pounding of the

wives against the boat. A little blood vessel in her right eye was

broken by a twig snapping in her face as she walked through the man-

Brove. This was treated by the ship's doctor.

91, AMFAUNA-14 anys that the AMHICK team performed very well. The

pickup in the park was done excellently.

The slight delay while

looked her over, she says, was due to the fact that the men had ex

pected another woman to be with her, and they were waiting a few minutes

in case the other woman should show up. The AMHICK. team sald that they

had alno boen briefed that she would be wearing her hair in a bun.

She had not been briefed accordingly, and she was wearing her hair

down her back in & pony tail.

This discrepancy did not cause any con

fumion, because every other item of the visual recognition signals

tallied perioctly, and the AMHICK team were well briefed on all of them

ANFAUNA-14 was impressed by the precise timing of the team'g

movements, by the fact that everybody was whare he was supposed to be

at the time indicated.

She expressed admiration for their seamanship,

and their ability to pick out one spot of mangrove from another in

the pitch darkness.

She says that, during these trying days, the team members were

always in calm control of the situation, and never falling in their

courtesy to her.

Regarding ANCUTLER-2, AMTAUNA-14 is sure that the exfiltration

instructions reached her.

They were taken, she said, by Lolita FORMOSO

who had been standing by for them from Friday to Sunday.

What Lolita

did with them, AHFAUNA-14 does not know.

She knows that we had

directly to ANCUTLER-2.

In any case, she knows that messages sent

no reason to assume that these inetructione did not.
