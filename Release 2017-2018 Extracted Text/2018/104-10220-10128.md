A POA was requontod on Sublect in January 1968 for hi:

uno as I ponetration of

Cancellation vas roquested in February 1968 because

o1 indications that Subjoct was involved in

"clandestine sabotage

activity and suspicions that Subject falled to report his activi

tos to CIA.

Thereafter, Subjoct was treatod as a "hostile".

In the ensuing months Subjoct was describod as

"an extromely

valuable penetration" bucause of his important and accurate

intelligence information and operational roports. Subject was

givon a polygraph oxanination to clear up questions about pos-

sable atfiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa

tion with gangstor elenents, ote.

His rosponsos showed no

information which would provent CIA using him for ops purposes.

Request for POA was again roquested on 7 Soptomber 1968.

PON request was turned down on 15 Octobor due to Subject being

"agent of a foreign powor."

Sinco that tine Subject has continued to provide verbal

and written information reports concerning Communist and subver

elements, guerrilla activities,

Soviot activities,

sabotage,

continues to report accurately

and often

a vory pro-U.S.

attitudo.

Subject was again polygraphod on

29 November 1971 (a copy

of which is contained in

Subject's

CI/OA folder).

His responses indicated no deception concern-

1ng truthfulness of reporting to CIA,

no compromise of his

Govornment connections, non-involvement in illegal arms

dealings, etc.

3. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR STATION TO WORK WITH FERNANDEZ IF HE

HIS GONERAL GREEDINESS AND LACK OF SCRUPLES MAKE HIM AN UNSAVORY PARTVER .

TO DEAL WITH AT THAT LEVEL.
