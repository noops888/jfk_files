COMMENTS RE DEROGATORY TRACES ~
ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

A’POA was requented on Subje r his

penetration of
Cancellation was requested in February 1968 because

o ndications that Subject was involved in "clandestine sabotage
activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi- «
tics to CIA, Thereafter, Subject was treated as a "hostile",

In the ensuing months Bubject was describod as "an extromely
valuable penctration™ because of his important and accurate
intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was
given a polygraph examination to clear up questions about pos-
sible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa- -
tion with gangster elements, etc, His responses showed no
information which would prevent CIA using him for ops purposes,
Request for POA was again requested on 7 Soptomber 1968. This
POA request was turned down on 15 Octobex duo to Subject being

an “agent of a foreign powor.”

2, Sinco that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
sive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
etc, Subjéct continues to report accurately and often and has
a vory pro-U.S, attitude. Subject was again polygraphed on
29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's
CI/0A folder), His responses indicated no deception concern-
ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
U.8, Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms

dealings, etc.

on Subject on 25 Janua: 7 tO use Subject as stated above.

On 1 February 1967, requested cancellation of the POA
request because. of Indications that Subject was involved in

clandestine sabotage activity and there were + hat
he had fai report, his activities to CIA

Station was directed to handle Subject aa a “hostile”.
The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with

Subject ag a soure £ information on activities
and but that.no requirements we
lev. ation was advised that they could make

spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS
co-ordinated on these directions to Station

2. The Station acknowlcdyed their instructions but
demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of ANCLEVE-15'a
activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are
often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con~
trol and who scidom disclose the complete range of their
activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they

wece interested in Subject because his ion as a “trusted

confidant" of certain highly Placed ee curity officials.
3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe

Subject as “an extremely valuable penetration" because of the

intelligence information and operational reports he

For example, he reported on the involvement of the

military ina Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And;
reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from

as part of an infiltration scheme. He has reported such

operational ee ae = 2 ds rip ‘on of the capabilities,
layout and equipment! japerations,
Included in this tnformation was his repor hat, at least on
paper, the U.S. Embassy was a target for pperations. He

has also reported on the personalities and workings of the
organizations with Which he is associated. At the same time

the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved
in a scheme to obtain “curare poison for approximately forty
hypodermic necdles". To avoid exposing the source of their
information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the
matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involve}
ment in wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-
tions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this

“dnvolvement with him. .

4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that
they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,
further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or
work against CIA. They added that Subject was still_capable of v
engaging in lependent Cuban exile activity without informing
hi ya The Station also requested a polygraph exam-

5. Subject was-given a polygraph examination to resolve
specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban
intelligence through relatives, unreported association with
gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM and other questions
involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject's
responses, deecribed as substantially truthful by the examiners,
appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's
operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv~
ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer,Lefty Rosenthal,
did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, ",..In fairness
to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un=
certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had
been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile
arms supplies, "

6. Station has requested that they be allcwed to
cease treating AMCLEVE-15 as a "hostile" and that he be pro-
cessed for POA/OA to permit more effective utilization of this
well placed penetration agent. Wil it
request.
