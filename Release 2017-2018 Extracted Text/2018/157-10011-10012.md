OCCURRENCE:

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states:

"The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick.

This refers to

a telephonic conversation on-the evening of 30 Oct. 1902 between Lansdale and Cheever

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

discussion of the COBRA and ANIORID teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's
