Entry in "Historic Diary".

[DDP 4- 0864]

• In a document entitled 'Historic Diary' there appears an entry

which refers to 'an elderly American'

entry is under the date 26

October 1959 when OSWALD was allegedly confined in an unidentified Moscow

hospital.

It is apparent that every effort should be made to iden-

tify the

elderly American, if he existed.

We assume the lead is

still outstanding.

our recommendation that the Department of state

urgently request through its channels a careful search of Embassy and Con-

sular records in Moscow which might reveal the identity of an elderly

American hospitalized

at the end of October 1959 and possibly registered

with the Embassy as a tourist.

An independent confirmation of this de-

ail could he of freat significance in validating the entries of OSWALD's

'Historic Diary'

and would possibly lead

to the develonment of additional

information on OSWALD's stay in the USSR."

AZCUE was schedu-

(DDP 4-2160]

As the result of a search of our graphics files for piatures perti-

nent to the story of lee Harvey OSWALD's sojourn in the USSR,

we have

found the attached photograph (Attachment

'A'), of a group of persons

near the Palace of Culture in Minsk. This photograph was taken by an

American tourist in Minsk on or about 11 August 1961.

Although the persons

in the photograph are not identified in our files, we believe on the basis

of comparison with other pictures that the second

person from the right is

Lee Harvey OSWALD.

It is worth noting that the person believed to be OSWALD is rearing

a short-sleeved

sport shirt of the same design or pattern as"one worn by

OSWALD in pictures taken of him in his apartment in Minsk in 1962.

of two such photographs, which were found among 'OSWALD's effects

The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20

The documents do clarify

original Russian terms used in decsribing his job.

The following points relating to the documents are worth noting:

"a. A significant omission from the materials provided is the letter

zenship. ...

"b.

• OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

Document for Foreigners.

The similarity of wording of the receipts

regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and travel regula-

tions further supports our belief that such regulations are identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD

Statements Reportedly Made by George

and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT

Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the Assassination of President Kennedy.

[DDP 4-3479]

"1. The information furnished below has been received from usually reli-

able sources and consists of statements reportedly made by the de MOHREN-

SCHILDTs concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the assassination of President

Kennedv.

the assassination of President

Kennedy, George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT were

among the guests attending a cocktail party in Haiti.

The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was

substance to the view expressed in certain foreign:

periodicals such as L'Express, a left-wing Parisian

weekly newspaper, that the Kennedy assassination was

a plot organized

by Dallas millionaires.

George de

MOIRENSCHILDT said

that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very

likely that certain reactionary elements in Dallas had!

organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis-

turbed person such as OSWALD to achieve their ends.

Mrs: de MOHRENSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis.

"3. A copy of this memorandum is being forwarded to the FBI."

CSCI-316/00856-64

Subject: Lee Harver OSWALD - Internal Secu-

rlity, Russia - Cuba.

Reference: Your Memorandum dated 28 July 1964.

"1. A review of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts at

the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had apparently been

taped was conducted with negative results.

Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape,

if broadcast at all, was aired over

a local USSR facili-

ty for internal

consumption.

With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any

attempt had heen made by the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propaganda

purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts,

or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in Minsk.

[DDP 4-4479]

The files of this Agency contain no identifiable traces on Konstantin

Petrovich SERGIEVSKY or on his sister.

"2. We have no information which would either confirm or refute allega-

tions that Lee Harvey OSWALD made one or more visits to the city of Gorky

in April and May 1960 or at any other time.

The term "mokrym delam' which appears in the notes which SERGIEVSKY

brought with him to the British Embassy may be translated

"wet affairs' or

'liquid affairs'.

It is an expression or jargon used by the KGB to refer

to activities involving kidnapping or assassination. . ..:

Subject: Joachim JOESTEN

[DDP 4- 5110]

Attached

are reproduced copies of a set of German documents seized by

the U.S. authorities at the end of World War II.

The documents

concern

Joachim JOESTEN, author of Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy?, Marzani & Mun®

The captured documents in this set range

in

dates from July

1936 to November 1937 and contain the statement that

JOESTEN had been a member of the Communist Party of Germany since 1932.

You will note that the attention of the German security organs was direc-

ted at JOESTEN as early as 1936.

At that: time

the Communist Party had been

been outlaved in Germany and the German authorities apparently had begun

collecting

information

about JOESTEN and his activities.

Their investiga-

Comment: The assassination of President Kennedy was the subject of a book

by

Joachim JOFSTEN entitled,

"OSWALD - Assassin or Fall Guy?" (1964)

pub-

lished by Marzani and Munsell Publishers, Inc. of New York, in which

JOESTEN states that there is no question

in his mind that OSWALD was a mi-

nor CIA agent. Marzani, a known communist, was coauthor of a pamphlet;

"Cuba Vs. CIA". published in 1961.

JOESTEN is revealed in a German Security

Police memorandum, dated November 8, 1937, to have been

an active member off

the German Communist Party (KPD) since May

12, 1932; he was issued Commu-

nist Party membership card (Mitgliedsbuch) No. 532315.
