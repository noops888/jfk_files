13. (Confidential - LLM) LIAISON Called Gerry Burke, NSA;

and indicated that as late as Friday night, Dave Bushong, Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence staff, was still of the opinion that Senator

James Pcarson (R., Kansas) would be traveling to the NSA facility in

England. Later, Burke advised that the matter has been resolved that

the Senator will not visit the facility, but instead will receive a briefing from

the NSA representative in London.

24. (Unclassified - LLM) LIAISON In the company of Dick Rininger,

/OGG, Don Burns, OS, and Doug Cummins, of our office, I met for several

hours with Bob Blakey, Chief Counsel, and James Wolf, staff of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations, to review the Committee's

security rules, non-disclosure agreement, and Memorandum of Understanding.

We completed negotiations on the first two documents and resolved one of

the two major problems with the Memorandum of Understanding. I told

Blakey that we would try to have our counter-proposal to him either tomorrow

or the next day which he said would be fine.

25. (Unclassified - LLM) BRIEFING Mike Van Dusen, House

international Relations Committee staff, called to cancel the scheduled

29 July briefing of the Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East because

of the pre-recess squeeze on the Cornmittee schedule and the fact that:

Chairman Lee Hamilion (D., Ind. ) would like to have the DCI appear

sometime in September.

26. (Unclassified - THW) BRIEFING I called Mike Van Dusen,

House International Relations Committee staff, and told him that, unfortunately,

official to brief the Subcommittee which he at first agreed to. He later called

Mr. Miller and said thai Chairman Hamilton wanted the Director to appear

and, thumfore, asked that the appearance be postponed until after the August

reces:.
