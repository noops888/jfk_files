HO 94-148

it was not deemed advisable to interview SCHARFF for

the following reasons:

SCHARFF is presently Agent in Charged the

United States Customs Bureau, Houston, is up in years

and has been a member of the Government Service for a

very long period of time. It has been the experience

of the Houston Office that SCHARFF is prone to allow

his mind to wander at times with the ultimate result that

imagination runs away with him. In addition SCHARFF during

the course of contacts in the past, has prefaced the

majority of his comments on his own personal opinions

and is unable to substantiate his personal opinions by

actual facts.

The Houston Division 1s of the opinion that

even though SCHARFF was interviewed under suitable

pretext, he may possibly discuss the interview with

FERTITA, who has

been most friendly and cooperative with

the Houston Division and of course this would not be

desired by the Houston Division.

It is worthy of pointing out that individuals

listed in the Details of this report were interviewed under

suitable pretext and no disclosure was made to any outside

source that the Bureau was conducting an inquiry relative

to the MAFIA.
