‘Ex-FBI Official
‘Defends Break-Ins

By EDWARD W. O'BRIEN

‘Newhouse News Service

WASHINGTON ~ W. Mark Felt, a retired top FBI ||
official, authorized two clandestine break-ins by FBI
agents to premises inyglving radical terrorist organiza-
tions, and he’s proud of it.

If he had refused to permit the agents to carry out
black-bag jobs in search of information about the groups,
“T would have been derelict in my duty,” Felt said in an
interview.

One entry four years ago to an Arab information |:
office in Dallas may have saved American lives, he indi- |,
cated. The FBI agents were able to photograph within i
minutes an ultra-secret membership list of 80 U.S. resi-
dents who were members or possible sympathizers of Al |,
Fatah, the Arab guerrilla organization affiliated with the
Palestinian Liberation Organization.

Other FBI agents around the country immediately
tracked down the 80 Arabs, interviewed them, “and let
them know they would be watched,” Felt recalled.

Not all of them were bombers, Felt said, but some
were viewed as potential terrorists. The FBI had learned
through informants that Al Fatah feared the FBI and
would be most unlikely to engage. in violence after mem-
bers’ identities were known,

The other FBI surreptitious entry approved in
advance by Felt as acting associate director of the bu-
reau was in an effort to trace some 20 Weathermen
fugitives being hunted for federal crimes. The break-in
was conducted in New York but failed to produce the
desired information, because friends and relatives of the
fugitives were extremely careful to avoid revealing clues
to help in their capture.

The Dallas break-in has not stirred any current legal |
problems for the FBI because of the PLO’s obvious con-
nection with foreign governments. But the Weatherman
entry — and others allegedly carried out against the
Socialist Workers Party, a Marxist organization — are
being investigated,

Felt and others of the FBI’s highest hierarchy at that
time are dismayed by the itivestigations. Most of his one-
time colleagues have chosen to remain publicly silent in
the face of possible indictments.

But Felt is outspoken about his actions prior to his

1973 retirement and the reasons for them.

The breakins were morally and probably legally |!
justified, he said, citing this quotation from Thomas
Jefferson: “A strict adherence to written laws is not the
highest duty of good citizens. The laws of self-preserva-
tion, of saving the country when danger abounds, are of
more importance, for without a nation there would be no
Constitution.”

A 1972 Supreme Court decision held that surrepti-
tious entry, without a warrant, to install an eavesdrop-
ping duvice against a domestic target, is lawful if the
tare? has a, “significant” connection with: a’ foreign

In the case of the Weatherman break-in, the FBI has
| recently filed with the, Justice Department a 500-page
: Teport documenting the‘ors ‘ganization’ 's ties with the Fidel
Castro regime in Cuba.

! “The Weatherman underground consists of a group
of vicious criminals who arrogantly claim credit for hun-
dreds of bombings and other acts of violence,” Felt said.
“They claim more than $10 million worth of damage to
public and private property.

“They bombed our Capitol, the Pentagon and the
State Department, to mention but a few. They brag that
they are Communist revolutionaries. Fidel Castro is their |’
mentor.

“It is very important to view the actions of the FBI
in the light of the time frame in which they occurred. .. .

“There are some who would argue that if a violent
action is motivated by political considerations, the FBI |
should not intervene until after the crime actually
occurs.

“There can be no double standard. Violence is vio-
lence, and murder is murder.”

Felt dismissed as ridiculous’ any claim that the FBI
has conducted massive surveillance of liberals or dissi-
dents. He gave these specifics: The FBI has 8,000 agents
in Washington and 59 field offices. It takes a minimum of
six agents to conduct round-the-clock surveillance of one
person. If all FBI agents were assigned to such work and
nothing else, the FBI could monitor fewer than 1,500
persons.

As for wiretapping, he said the maximum number of
national security telephone taps at one time under the
late J. Edgar Hoover was about 40, and under his succes-
sor, L. Patrick Gray, the high was about 100. The total
number of organized crime taps during a year was ap-
proximately 250, he said.

These figures, he said, should be evaluated against a
total of more than 200 million telephones in the United
States,

After a 31-year career in the FBI, including service
from 1958 to 1962 as special agent in charge of the’
Kansas City, Mo., office, Felt said, he can assure the
American people of the bureau’s dedication to protecting:
their rights as individuals.

“The FBI has always made a very great effort to see
that an investigation was aimed at clearing the innocent-
as well as finding the guilty,” he said. He is familiar with
law enforcement practices in Britain and other democra-+
cies,-he said, “and none of them goes to the lengths we do!
inprotecting the rights of the individual.”

Felt testified before the current Washington grand’
jury and made, he’said, a full disclosure about the —_

a “My feeling is that L.will not be indicated,” he said.’

SOME OF THE domestic intelligence
burglaries conducted by the FBI in 1972
are now being laid ac the feet of L. Patrick
Gray Ill, who was briefly acting director
after the death of J. Edgar Hoover in May
yof that year,

It's hard to know what was happening
within the Federal Bureay of Investiga-
tion at that time. W. Mark Felt, former
associate FBI director, says he approved
“burglaries because he hv4 heard Gray say
~“he would approve these things.” Edward
S. Miller, former head of FBI intelligence,
says Gray approved such break-ins in a
conversation at which there was no third-
party witness. Gray, through his lawyer,
jhas denied “condoning or approving, di-

“rectly or indirectly, any illegal act” by the
> FBL

". It should be remembered that the
summer of '72 was the time Gray was up
to his neck in problems involving the con-
tents of “plumber” Howard Hunt’s safe,
the CIA and White House aide John Dean
‘—a time when; he told the Senate Water-
gate investigators, “I, was confused,
vuncertain and uneasy.”

- Gray has testified he had several
briefings from Mark Felt, and gave Felt
directions, in that per: u. Thess had to do
with CIA relations and the Hunt papers,
which were not what Gray took them to
be, and which he wrongly destroyed think-
ing, he said, he was protecting national
security. In the end, when his Senate con-
firmation hearings brought out much of
this, Gray fotind himself, in the words of, :
former President Nixon's aide, John Ehr-
lichman, being left to “hang there” and
“twist slowly in the wind.”

Speaking of his mistake in burning
‘the Hunt papers, Gray told the Watergate
Committee in August, 1973: “I shall carry
the burden of that act with me always.”

. | LOOKING AT THE statements made
‘about Gray and the FBI burglaries this
week by Felt and Miller, Gray's words

seem prophetic. ”

But more than that, the FBI continues

Page 4

to carry the burden ~ and so does its
present director, Clarence M. Kelley.

Kelley is having to devote so much
time to trying to save a little of the FBI’s
credibility and morale that he is left little -
time for running what is one of the most
important agencies - of federal
government.

It is good to clean up past FBI errors.
And it is vital to be assured that the FBI
is not still governed by old-time loyal
Hoover hands who #: -tinctively obey past
conditioning.

Somewhere the FBI needs a line to
divide the abuses of the past and the ef-
forts to live by the new rules, We need the
FBI to fight crime and subversion. We
need an FBI free of political interference.
We need an FBI that can be proud of it
self and make us proud of it.

“—Seill ‘Twistitig Slowly’

It cannot be left to go anas Gray,

was, “twisting slowly in the wind.”

NAACP’s Roy Wilkins Says"
He Will Refuse to Retire

ized attempt to oust him by “a small

By PAUL VANCIL

Pross-Scimitar Staff Writer

In an open break with some.members of
the NAACP board of directors, executive
director Roy Wilkins told delegates at
Cook Covention Center today he would re-
fuse to retire in January as previously
announced.

Wilkins, 75, said he now plans to stay on

until the July 1977 national convention be-
cause a statement that he would retire in
January was made without consulting him
and “a campaign of vilification” had been
Started against him by certain board
members.
* Wilkins told the delegates in a short
statement this morning, “Jt was with
shock that I learned that a campaign of
vilification of me had been started. . . by
certain members of the board and contin-
ues until this day. If God is willing I shall
be at the St. Louis convention as an active
directing member of the NAACP family.

“Tf the board elects to fire me before
that time, then I shall have to call upon
you to let me represent your interests di-
rectly.”

At a press conference later, Wilkins ree
fused to name the board members he
referred to, but said there was an organ-

powerful group.” However, his wife
Minnie said the attempt had started after
Mrs. Margaret Bush Wilson of St. Louis
had become board chairman.

He said the criticisms starting about 18
months ago had affected his health but
did not specify.

Wilkins said he did not know why the
board members wanted him out.

Wilkins said he understood the agree-
ment with the board was that he would
become consultant at executive director's
salary in January if his successor had:
been chosen by them. But Mrs. Wilkins
said a recently drawn contract said he
would become a consultant at only $10,000
per year, a large drop from his reported
$38,500 per year.

The NAACP Resolutions Committee:

today proposed a resolution calling for an
investigation of alleged FBI survelliance
of NAACP merabers and possible criminal
prosecution “of those responsible.”

The call came in the committee’s Civil
Rights Resolution,

The resolution said: “Those responsible
persons still employed by the FBI shoul
be disciplined and an independent ani
impartial agency appointed by the Con-

,Bress to investigate and recommend

appropriate action including criminal

prosecution against those who violated the
- rights of so many Americans.”

In the same resolution, President Ford,
and congressional members were called
upon “to cease cheap demagoguery and
begin to obey the law” on school busing.
‘The resolution also asks for a federal

* investigation of “the growing epidemic of

violence against black citizens.”
* Also reported out of committee were
resolutions on foreign affairs, communica-

‘tions, labor and industry, consumer

protection and economic development. All
resolutions may be amended by the dele-
gates.

Resolutions on education, housing, po-
litical action, health and armed services
are also expected. The delegates will con-
sider the resolutions today and tomorrow.

* In the proposed foreign affairs resolu-

tion, the committee noted its approval of
US. policy supporting majority rule by
blacks in African countries. It reaffirmed

. a 1975 resolution calling on American

businesses to stop investing in South Afri-
ca “until apartheid is ended and majority
rule becomes reality.”

Monday the delegates adopted an emer-
gency resolution condemning violence
against blacks in South Africa"

Is FBI Or Individual Agent"
Responsible For Illegalities?,

By GARRY WILLS

HE NUREMBURG principle has been chal-
lenged in its international application. Some
international law is not recognized by all na-
imposed on the conquered, it amounts to
promulgating and enforcing the law simultaneous-
ly, Nonetheless, we as a nation did establish the
Nuremburg principle, and we have tried on occa-
sion to abide by it, even when the criminal was an
American soldier (¢.g., Lt. William Calley).

But even if there are some arguments against
the principle in international affairs, we cannot
logically assert it in a questionable area and deny
it where no such doubts apply. In domestic affairs,
when we are dealing with fellow citizens under a
single legal system, there can be no defense for
breaking a law on the grounds that “I was just
obeying orders.” The judge very eloquently knock-
ed down that defense in the “plumbers” trial.

Many well-documented crimes against Ameri-
gan citizens have been committed by active agents
Of the CIA and the FBI. Yet no single perpetrator
ff those multiple crimes has been convicted. In the
Jew cases where indictments were brought, the

encies succeeded in quashing them. But now we
hear that the Justice Department is investigating
the network of FBI agents who committed illegal
searches and seizures in the campaign against the
Socialist Workers Party.

TO SOME AMERICANS, the idea of holding a
“G-Man” to account for undermining the Constitu-
tion is unthinkable. These people have been treated
as above the law. But such an attitude not only did
long-term damage to our society; it reduced FBI

agents to the pawns of an autocratic director. We

citizens could never question an agent, because an
agent could never question J. Edgar Hoover's
orders. The agents were systematically humiliated,
regimented, and forced to do dirty work.

As Dostoievsky described the process in “The
Possessed,” nothing strengthened the conspiracy
like the implication of all its members in interre-
lated crimes. Then no one can “squeal” because. all
are vulnerable. That was the power the FBI had
over its own. :

It is time — long past time — to break that
power. There is no question, now, that FBI agents
broke the law. So: how do we prove that the FBI is
not organizationaliy committed to law-breaking ex-
cept by prosecutien of actual law-breakers? The
effect will be to berate future agents, no matier
how much presently implicated agents protest the
unfaimess of punishing them. After all, they were

the laws they are sworn to execute? After all, if
John Mitchell, a former head of the Justice
Department, can stand trial, then why not a hired
burglar for the FBI? 7

As I say, one result of this will be the libera-
tion of future government employes from the pre-

The FBI Had A Job

To Do And Did It

THE SENATE Intelligence

Committee — is still sticking pins
in the FBI. :

‘Thecommitteeisissuinga series
of 18 reports critical of the FBI.

Sen. Frank Church (D-Ida.) says
that the FBI sought for 15 years to
discredit and disarm groups and

ideologies ranging from ‘Commu-
, nists to neo-Nazis, from black hate

groups to the Ku Klux Klan.

‘Thecommittee contends that the
FBI’s countermeasures may have
been illegal.

THE COMMITTEE convenient-
¥ forgets it was Congress that

lelegated to the FBI the entire
responsibility for our nation’s in-
ternal security.

It was the FBI’s duly assigned

Mission to protect our established -

order against the wreckers.
The Federal Bureau of Investi-
ation and its longtime director J.

-THE WRIT of the Senate Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence has run out and

: people of the nation have reason to be
grateful, whatever their chagrin or
outrage about its revelations.

That record has been made clear,
enough: Millions of Americans were

were spied upon in ways that were
hitherto regarded as the Practices of
police states. :

“Phe CIA, the FBI and other intelli

gence agencies have had their methods
exposed, and it hasn’t been pretty. The
' CIA had its assassination plots and its
. moves against foreign governments.
: The FBI had its mail openings, elec-
“tronic espionage, and efforts to under--
cut civil rights leaders and to infiltrate
political and other organizations.

it is apparent informants kept a
check on any number of groups, not
only across the political spectrum, but
. inother areas such as the media. Since
this newspaper itself was lately in-
volved, the whole range of activities
revealed by the Senate committee hits
home even harder. |

There is a new start. The Senate,
after seme wrangling, adopted the
chief recommendation of the Select

cient powers to oversee the intelligence

FBI Director ‘Clarence Kelley was
correct — though a bit late —-- to apolo-

abuses of power and lawless tactics.
-In a carefully written weekend
speech, Kelley Said the FBI was “truly
sorry” for its misdeeds and for the first
time put the blame squarely on the late
J. Edgar Hoover. :

Kelley was referring to-the FBI coun-
terintelligence programs (Cointelpro)
which from 1956 to 1971 tried to disrupt

Communist Party, the Ku Klux Klan —_
the Black Panthers.

gence Committee criticized Cointelpro
for making up derogatory information
against its “targets” and sending it to
their families and employers. =

The coramittee cited several cases
where FBI misinformation ied to vio-
lence between radical groups and even.
some killings. It also accused the FBI of
smearing the late civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr., urging him to
commit. suicide and blackening his repu-
tation even after his assassination.

that the agencies respect their charters

campaign against King and the CIA’s

By ALAN BERNSTEIN

FBI director Clarence Kelley,
who has lent some candor to the
intelligence agency’s dealings
since his 1973 appointment, contin-
ued his reiatively open stance
while in Nashville Monday. for a
television show taping.

Citing his approval during con-
firmation hearings of a legislative
committee on the intelligence
community, Kelley said he wel--
comes the idea’of an FBI oversight -
committee in the House or Sen-

te.

‘We're willing to work with
them,” he said’ after hig arrival
Monday morning.

But Kelley, who was chief Ten-
nessee FBI agent in the early 1960s,
had little to say on other FBI
issues.

ineffective. Out of the hundreds whose
rights were violated, very few were ever
found to have committed a crime.

The most recent disclosures by Sen-
ate investigators of the FBI point up the
foolishness of most of it. Through one tap,
for instance, the FBI learned the wife of
their “target” had ordered meat from the
market and that his daughter had a
toothache.

There is a move now to create an
oversight commitiee in Congress. We sup-
port the move in principal but with some

cies that it will render them ineffective.

critics will fall victim to the same sort of -

FULTON, Mo. (AP} — FBI Director
Clarence Keliey Saturday issued his first
public apology for past FEI misdeeds
such as the campaign to harass and dis-
Fupt militant political groups and discred-
it their leaders.

“We are traly sorry we were responsi-

such criticism,” Kelley suid. “We need to
make it clearly understood that we recog-
nize errors and have learned from them.”

He spoke in a lecture series at West-
minster Coll-ge, and most of the 250 to
300 in the audieice were on campus for
alumni weekend festivities.

-The FBI director followed carefully his
prepared manuscript but at the end made
a plea that diligence be tempered by rea-
son, vigilance by understanding. In this

© way, he said, the country can fully realize
the power of a free people.

The spcech was a striking departure
from the tone and content of Kelley's
previous public statements about FBI mis-

- deeds and thé congressional investigations

The Senate report said the FBI conduct-
ed “intensive coverage” of a group called

to spot presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald as one of its members. The FBI
had listed some 200 pro-Castro activists as
“potentially dangerous individuals” but
Oswald, who in 1963 headed the commit-
tec's New Orleans-chapier, was not in-
cluded on the list.

Tne Hoover _
FBI‘Black Bag’
Assignments

=
i
J

WASHINGTON — The FBI,
without technically telling an
untruth, has led the public to
believe its agents took part in
no more than 238 criminal
housebreakings. The actual
figure is well over 1,000 and
may surpass 2,000.

These “black bag” jobs, as

‘the late FBI chief J. Edgar
| Hoover called them, were
| employed principally against
suspected spies, organized
‘crime figures, foreign diplo-
mats and a few dangerous
revolutionaries.
I But Hoover also sent his
agents to burglarize the pre-
mises of law-abiding U.S. citi-
'zens:whom the old FBI cur-
mudgeon simply disliked.

Confidential FBI memos,
obtained by the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee, acknowl-
edge'that the “black bag” jobs
violated the criminal laws the
‘FeIiwas supposed to enforce.
‘Yet we have learned from FBI

sources that Hoover, although
sworn to uphold the laws, per-
sonally sanctioned more
1,000 of the break-ins.

Not until 1967 did Hoover
take steps, in a self-serving
memo turned up by the Senate
probers, to end the break-ins.
Even then, we have learned, it
wasn’t his own idea but pres-
sure from then-Attorney-Gen-
eral Ramsey Clark that
brought the change.

The figure of 238 “surrepti-
tious entries,” as the burgla-
ries were politely called, first
appeared in an FBI memo to

e Senate committee on Sept.
23, 1975,

The memo accurately but

housebreakings were perpe-|
trated against 14 ‘‘domestic:
subversive targets” during
the 1942-68 period. But a care-
ful reading shows the bureau)
left a hedge. Almost in pass-
ing, the memo indicates the
figure is “incomplete,” based
as much on the memory of
agents as on actual data. In-
deed, Hoover purposely des-
troyed many of the records
dealing with the break-ins,
presumably to eliminate doc-
umentary evidence of the FBI
crimes.

From our internal sources,
however, we have ascertained
that some top FBI officials!
believe the 1,000-to-2,000 fig-:
ure is a “conservative esti-
mate’ of the total house-
breakings. These include not
only burglaries to get infor-
mation but break-ins to install
bugging devices.

breakings go back far beyond

chief Clarence Kelley, howev-

The Senate Intelligence

better demand that it begin
with the government. A
lawless government is far
more dangerous than any
lawless individual. Yet in
spite of the clear evidence that

e FBI, CIA and other agen-
cies engaged in illegal acts,
the Senate Rules Committee
led by Chairman Howard
Cannon, D-Nev., voted
against strong oversight of
these agencies.

CHAUFEUR’S com-
plaint: The former _secre-
tary of Rep. Phillip Burton,
D-Calif., a member of the
powerful House leadership,
has accused him of requiring
her to chauffeur him around
at all hours until it broke her
health.

Mrs, Nina-Ann Coleman, 51,
also claims she had to pay
more than $15,000: from
own pocket for gasoline, re-

pairs, insurance and_a_suc-,

cession of cars since 1987 to
keep up with Burton’s 12-hour
days. :

mitted to the Labor Depart-
ment for disability payments,

that she was pressed into ser-
vice as a chauffeur not only
for the congressman but for
his wife, a movie star, union
friends and other colleagues.

She ferried Mrs. Burton to
the market, to-clothing stores
and to. parties, the filed papers
allege. On one occasion, Mrs.
Coleman picked up a Burton
aide at Dulles Airport, she
said, but later discovered he
had submitted a voucher for
the trip and had: chiseled $20
out of the taxpayers. The staff
member, Maurice Shean, vi-
gorously denies the charge.

On the way home from an-
other airport pickup, accord-
ing to Mrs. Coleman, the ci-

ret smoke in her car was so
thick, it precipitated an asth-
ma attack. A statement from
her doctor adds that she was
so-affected by the smoke; she
had to be hospitalized.

Her husband, in another
signed statement, said she be-
came “a slave to her office,”
leading to twoseparations be-
fore she was fired by Burton
earlier this year. :

Responding to the Labor
Department’s request for
comment, Burton said Mrs;
Coleman’s illness had made
her irritable, nervous and ab-
sent from work about two
months a year since 1974. He}

FBI Spies Heid
Law Violators

‘ By JOHN M. CREWDSON | ~

! ‘The New York Times News Service

WASHINGTON — Do-
mestic intelligence. ageri-
_ Gies, principally the Fed-
‘eral Bureau of
Investigation, consciously
and repeatedly violated
the laws and the Constitu-
tion in investigating the

olitical activities of

undreds of thousands of
American citizens, many
,of them law-abiding, the
Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence said yes-
terday. :

IN A SHARPLY worded
report summarizing its 15-
month-long examination
of government spying in-
side this country, the com-

-mittee rebuked the FBI
and other agencies for in-
vestigating far foo many
people, often for the wrong
reasons or none at all, for
employing as a matter of
course illegal or question-
able techniques, and for-
having acted largely with-
out the scrutiny or knowl-
edge of presidents and at-
torneys generals.

THE COMMITTEE,
which has now completed
what it termed the first
systematic investigation
of federal law-enforce-
ment agencies in history,
said it had uncovered a
pattern of illegal and abu-
sive acts stretching back
over six presidential ad-
ministrations and four de-
eades that was neither
partisan nor the product of
a “a few willful men,” but
an inevitable result of the
;“excessive” growth of ex-

ti
"Congress.

ive power unchecked -

Major findings by the
committee included
these:

@ A lack of precise stan-
dards for the conduct of
intelligence investigations
has led the FBI over the
last 20 years to conduct
nearly one million inves-
tigations of “subversive”
or “extremist” matters, 5
half of which resulted in ,
‘the creation of a perma-:
nent FBI file, although no,
: prosecutions have been

rought since 1957 under

the subversion statutes.

@ The “overly broad”
objectives of the domestic
intelligence community
have been achieved

, through such “intrusive:

' techniques” as mail open-
ing, burglary, sophisticat-
ed electronic surveillance
and the use of informants,
and that legal limitations
on their use have been’
nonexistent, inadequate
or, where they did exist,
ignored by law-enforce-
ment officials.

@ Covert-action pro-
grams; like the FBI’s
Cointelpro, have inter-
fered with constitutional
' freedoms of political asso-
ciation, disrupted groups ,
,that were ‘“‘concededly

!nonviolent,”’ risked or,
caused “serious emotion- :
al, economic or physical
damage” to those who
were unwitting targets of

(Mount Clipping in Space Below)

: There is little in the final report by
the Senate Intelligence Committee on
domestic spying that the public hasn’t
known or suspected for some time.

~ However, the facts are nonetheless
deeply disturbing and certainly warrant
repetition for purposes of emphasis.

Needless to say, the decades-long
campaign of illegal surveillance of
Americans in which top governmental
officials were involved since the days of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt must
cease.

According to the report, the FBI, CIA,
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Army
Intelligence and other agencies created
files on more than half a million U.S.
citizens, opened nearly 250,000 pieces of
first-class mail, monitored millions of
telegrams and overseas phone calls, list-
ed 26,000 citizens for detention in a na-
tional emergency and subjected many
private citizens to secret harassment de-
signed to disrupt their lives or destroy
their reputations.

The committee’s work on the domes-
tic espionage activities, like that of
international spying operations, was
thorough and its recommendations are
to the point,

tive activities of the IRS and Army
Intelligence, together with bans on wire-
taps, mail openings and unauthorized
entries by the CIA. All domestic intelli-
gence work would be vested in the FBI.

But perhaps the most important
proposal is for a powerful, permanent
congressional committee to oversee
intelligence activities and to have legis-
lative and budgetary power over the CIA
and all other intelligence agencies,

Almost befere the ink was dry on the
report, the Senate Rules Committee
brushed aside this recommendation. The
net result of its action would be to leave

rol over the various intelligence
agencies in the-hands of those congres-
sional committees which now hold it so
jealously — and which manifestly have
been lax in exercising control up to now.

It remains to be seen what will hap-
pen when the subject comes up for
debate in the Senate within a week or
two.

Citizens concerned about the evils of
untrammeled surveillance in the past

— EBPs: Image Problem ~

ONE OF THE BIG prablems in fight-

ing crime today is that the FBI, once the
+ paragon of integrity in law enforcement,
has lost much of its credibility.

The disclosure of scores of burglaries
of Socialist Workers Party offices by FBI
agents back in the early 1960s contradicts
Justice Departmest statements denying
such activity. Coming amid so many other

“revelations of ctrenge and sometimes
‘unethical conduct in FBI operations of the
past, this is one more raveling of a ance-

7 proud past.

But once again it underlines the great
task Of rebuilding the Federal Bureau of
Investigation’s image. No one is more
acutely aware of this need than Claren
Kelley, the candid former Kansas City po-
lice chief who is now director of the na-
tion's foremost investigative agency. «

- KELLEY, WE ARE glad to note,
wastes no
embarrassing, improper and illegal activi-
ties which have surfaced since the empire
of J. Edgar Hoover cracked with his death
in May, 1972, -

Kelley does spend a lot of time trying
to convince the public that none of those
abuses has been swept under the rug. And
he keeps repeating that the present FBI is
being run strictly according to what is
legal and what is right.

While the director rightly says that
performance is the best way to restore
public confidence, he admits he spends
oa being “a salesman for the

mil 55240 DocId:32989817 Page 32

Kelley is aware of the pitfalls there.
He agrees that the FBI was “oversold” in
Hoover’s day. “I think this attention on
the spectacular gave an aura of mystery
and mystique to the FBI, when there was
none,” says Kelley. “It’s a hard, laborious
type of activity — knocking on decors,
going through the investigative process.
‘The aura was aided, to a great extent, by
the movies-and tne press,”

The “guilty” pleas to that will be
mony. The here worship in himself which

Hoover encouraged, and the cover he

built for FBI excesses and imperfections
all succeeded because so many image

- makers were willing to be Jed — or mis-

led,

SOMETHING HAS BEEN learned.’ °

Congress, the Justice Department, the

executive branch and the public know
what to avoid and what recourse to take to: -

RESPONSE TO WLOK EDITORIAL
REGARDING FBI AIRED DURING
PORIOD DECEMBIR 15 ~ 20, 1975

An editorial broadcast by Radio Station WLOX earlier
this month accused the FBI of not only being alcof to beatings
and harrassment of clvil rights workers in the south in the
1960's, but of boing “an active participant in illogal efforts
to destroy the civil rigats movement."

To support this double-edged charge, WLOK cited the
testimony which Gary Rowe, a former Ku Klux Klansman and PBI
informant, gave to a committes of the United States Senate on
December 2, 1975. In fairness, WLOK's listeners are entitled
to know that Ur, James B. Adams, a Deputy Acsecinte Dircctor
of the TBI, made a factual refutation of Gary Rowe's allegations

before the same Senate committce the samo day.

tir. Adams told the comuittee that the information which
Gary Rove furnished the FRI concerning planned acts of Klan
violoree was reported to the police “in every instance." He
acknovledged that on sonc oeeasions the police did not take :
f i ‘ Boa) 52
action after receiving these reports from the FBI, and he told

the committee that the PBI dutifully brought this Inet to the
ORIALIZED.

attention of the Department of Justice.

RESPONSE TO WLOX EDITORIAL

This action by the PBI resulted in the Attorney
Gonoral's sending U. 8. Marshals to the arcas involved to
guarantee the safety of civil rights workers.

In his svorn testimony, this FBI official told the
members of tho committee "Ve wore doing everything wo could
layfully do at the time, and finally tho situation vas
corrected when the Department, agreeing that we had no further
jurisdiction, sent the U. S, Marshals down to perform cortain
law enforcement functions."

The FBI is rightfully proud of its role in preventing
many acts of racist violonce in the south during the 1960's
and in solving other acts which did occur, such as the murders
og three young Civil Rights workers in Niesissippi in 1964, and
a cories of other burnings, bombings, and killings committed by
Elansmen and Klan sympathizers.

Many knowledgeable persons, both within and without the
Civil Rights reverent, credit the FBI with having cpoarheaded

the counter-offensive that brought an end to the wave of racist
violence which svept across sence areas of the South in the 1960's.

WLOK overlooked these facts in its earlier editorial.

EDITORIAL

Back in the early 1960s, when civil rights workers in the South were being
beaten and harrassed by racists, the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared

a good deal less than concerned.

Now a Senate investigation reveals what a lot of people suspected at the time--
that the FBI wasn't merely aloof, but that it was an active participant in

illegal efforts to destory the civil rights movement.

Lawmen, sworn to uphold the law, themselves performed lawless acts. Take the
bombshell dropped at a recent committee hearing by Gary Rowe, an undercover

agency who joined the Ku Klux Klan for the FBI.

Rowe testified that he fed the Bureau advance information about planned Klan
attacks on civil rights workers and that no action was taken to prevent the

attacks or to bring action against the perpetrators.

He testified that the Klan planned a vicious attack with clubs and bats upon

freedom riders demonstrating against segregated transportation facilities. The
Klan, he said, had the complete cooperation of the Birmingham police department
not only in this incident, but also in others, even enjoying access to officials

files and cars.



Steps have to be taken to assure that the FBI and similar federal police
agencies never again become criminal outfits themselves. The days of a

demi-god second-rater who could run the FBI as a personal fief to conduct
his own vendettas must be over. Without structured accountability built

i "into the FBI and the Justice Department, future abuses are inevitable.

| The only assurance the Black Community has against continuation of abuses
is for Blacks to be sitting at the table when policies are developed and

implemented...

Senator Tower. The Committee will come to order.

Mr. Wannall, according to data, informants provide 83
percent of your intelligence information.

Now, will you provide the Committee with some information

on the criteria for the selection of informants?

Mr. Wannall. Based ona sampling of about 93 cases.

Senator Tower. Would that appear to be a fairly accurate
figure. ,

Mr. Wannall. I have not seen any survey which the FBI
itself has conducted that would confirm that, but I think that
we do ae the principal portion of our information from live
sources.

Senator Tower. It would be a relatively high percent.

then?

Mr. Wannall. I would say yes. And your quest’

senator Tower, What criteria do you use in the selection
of informants?

Mr. wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. In
our cases relating to extremist matters, surely in, order to get
an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged in a
criminal type ‘activity, you're going to have a different set
of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist
principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating
in the same area, and in various established sources such as
local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type
who has credibility, can be depended’ upon to be reliable, we
would interview the individual in order to make a determination
as to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI
in discharging its responsibilities. in. that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we
would conduct a rather in depth investigation for. the. purpose
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator. Tower. .How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between
the. use of informants for law enforcement as opposed to

intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best address
the use of informants on criminal matters since he is over
the operational division on that.

Mr. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the me
that a criminal informant in a law enforcement function, you
are trying to develop evidencé which will be admissible in
court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant
alone, your purpose could either be prosecution or it could be
just for purposes of pure intelligence.

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality
of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,
through ee of the informant, obtain evidence which could be
used independently of the testimony of the informant so that
he can continue operating as a criminal informant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to
function as provocateurs?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, they're not. We have strict regula-
tions against -using informants as provocateurs. This gets
into that delicate area of entrapment which has been addressed
by the courts on many occasions and has been concluded by the

courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage

in an activity, the government has the right to provide him the

opportunity. This does not mean, of course, that mistakes don't
occur in this area, but we take whatever steps we can to

avoid this. Even the law has recognized that informants can

engage in criminal activity, and the courts have held that,
especially the Supreme Court in the Newark County Case, that -
the very difficulty of penetrating an ongoing operation, that
an informant himself can engage in criminal activity, but
because there is lacking this criminal intent to violate a
law, we stay Pile from that. Our regulations fall short of mere
If we have a situation where we felt that an informant

has to become involved in some activity in order to protect

or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United ~
States Attorney or to the Attorney General to try to make sure
we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our
Ligormants. : {

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do
instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that
they are informing on, do you not?

Mr. Adams. We did when we had the COmNTELPRO programs,
which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably
one of the best examples of a situation where’ the’ law was:
in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used
much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little
Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending
in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law
enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the

troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

to preserve the respective roles in law enforcement, You have
historical problems with the Klan conita along. We had
situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost
powerless to act. Wechad local Yaw enforcement officers in
some areas participating in Klan violence.

The instances mentioned by Mr. Rowe, every one of those,
he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't
see what action was taken with that information, as he pointed
out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance. We
also knew that in certain instances the information, upon being
received, was not being acted upon. We also disseminated
simultaneously through letterhead ‘memoranda to the Department
of Justice the problem, and here, here we were, the FBI, in a
position where we had no authority in the absence of instructioy
from the Department of Justice, to make an arrest. ,

Sections 241 and 242 don't cover it because you don't have
evidence of a conspiracy, and it ultimately resulted in
a situation where the Department called in United States
Marshals who do havé authority similar to local law enforcement
officials.

So, historically, in those days, we were just as frus-
trated as anyone else was, and when we got information from
someone like Mr. Rowe, good information, reliable information,

and it was passed on to those who had the responsibility to

no violation.

Congress recognized this, and-it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the civil rights
statute, which added punitive measures against an individual
that didn't have to be a conspiracy. But this was a problem
that the whole Gantry was grappling with: the President of
the United States, Attorney General. We were ina situation
where we had rank lawlessness taking place, as you know from

Veterans Against the War?

Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the
intent to halter political expression?

Mr. Adams, We had information on the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War that indicated that there were -subversive
groups involved. They were going to North Vietnam and meeting,
with the Communist forces. They were going to Paris, attending
meetings paid for and sponsored by the Communist Party, the
International Communist Party. We feel that we-had a very valid
basis to direct our attention to the VVAW,

: It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was
head of the Communist Party, USA, and the comments he made,
and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it
split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost
group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point
factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and they closed
those chapters because there was no longer any intent to follow
the national organization.

But we had a valid basis for investigating it, and we
‘investigated chapters to determine if there was affiliation
and subservience to the national office.

When you're looking at an organization, do you report only the

that the whole intent of the group is not in violation of the
statutes, You have to report the good, the favorable along
with the unfavorable, and this is a problem. We wind up with
information in our ‘tiles. We are accused of being vacuum
cleaners, and you are a vacuum cleaner.’ If you want to know the
real purpose of an organization, do you only report the
violent statements made and the fact that it is by.a small
minority, or do you also-show the broad base of the organizatioh
and what it really is?

Mr. Adams. It hangs me up. But in the same files I
imagine every one of you has been interviewed by the FBI, eithe:
asking you about the qualifications of some other Senator
being considered for a Presidential appointment, being inter-
viewed concerning some friend‘ who is applying for a job.

Were you embarrassed to have that in the files of the
FBI?

Now, someone can say, as reported at our last session, tha’
this is an indication, the mere fact that we have a name in our
files has an.onerous impression, a chilling effect. I agree.
It can have, if someone wants to distort what we have in our

of considering a man for the Supreme Court of the United

Senator Hart of Michigan. this is what should require
us to rethink this whole business.

Mr. Adams. Absolutely.

And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well
as the Congressional input ee going to address themselves to.

Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked about a wide Pande
of groups which the Bureau can and has had informant penetration
and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's ‘definition
of when an extremist or security investigation-may be under-
taken refers to groups whose activity either involves wiolation
of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation
of such law, and when such an investigation is opened, then
informants may be used.

Another guideline says that domestic intelligence
investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations.
The agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation
relevant to a potential violation. Even now, with an improved,
upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back
again in a world of possible violations or activities which
may result in illegal acts.

Now, any constitutionally protected exercise of the
right to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest, to petition,
conceivably may result in, violence or disruption of a local
town meeting, when a controversial social issue might result

in disruption. It might be by hecklers rather than those holdin:

Senator Hart of Michigan, Let's assume that the rule

for opening an investigation on a group is narrowly drawn. The

Bureau manual states that ‘informants investigating a subversive

organization should not only report on what that group is

doing but should look at and report on activities in which:

the group is participating.

There is a Section 87B3 dealing with reporting on
connections with other groups. ‘That section says that the
field office shall "determine and report on any, significant
connection or cooperation with non-subversive groups." ‘Any
significant connection or cooperation with nontenbveaeaye
groups.

Now let's look at this in practice. In the spring of
1969 there was a rather heated national debate over the

installation of the anti-ballistic missile system. Some of us

remember that. An FBI informant and two FBI confidential

sources reported on the plan's participants and activities
of the Washington Area Citizens Coalition Against the ABM,
particularly in open public debate in’a high school auditoriun,
which included speakers from the Defense Department for the
ABM and a scientist and defense analyst against the ABM,

The informants reported on the planning for the meeting,
participation by local clergy, plans to seek resolution on i

ABM from nearby town councils. There was also informat*: on

Now the information, the informant information came -as

with all aspects and all participants, The reports on the

Senator Hart of Michigan, Or if you were to rerun it,

Mr. Adams. Well, not in 1975, compared to what 1969
was, The problem we had at the time was where we had an
informant who had reported that this group, this meeting was
going to take place and it was going to be the Daily World,
which was the east coast communist newspaper that made comments
about it. They formed an organizational fetes att We took
a quick look at it. The case apparently was opened in May .28,
1965 and closed June 5 saying there was no problem with this
organization.

Now the problem we get into is if we take’a quick look

and get out, fine. We've had cases, though, where we have

This one is the fall of last year, 1975. President
Ford announced his new program with respect to amnesty, as
he described it, for draft resistors. Following that there .
were several national coureeontaa involving all the groups
and individuals interested in unconditional amnesty.

plans for the meeting and apparently attended and reported on
the conference, The Bureau's own reports described the
participants -_ shaving represented diverse’ perspectives -on

| the issue of amnesty, including civil liberties and human
rights groups, G.I. rights spokesmen, parents of men killed
in Vietnam, wives of ex-patriates in Canada, experts on draft
counselling, religious groups interested in peace issues,
delegates from student organizations, and aides of House and
| Senate twembers, drafting legislation on amnesty.

The informant el eneiy was attending in his role as
a member of a. group under investigation as allegedly subversive
and it described the topics of the workshop.

Ironically, the Bureau office report before them noted
that in view of the location of the conference at a theological
seminary, the FBI would use restraint and limit its coverage .
to informant reports.

Now this isn't five or ten years ago. This is last
fall. - And ‘this is’a conference of people who have the point
of view that I share, that the soaner we have unconditional
amnesty, the better for the soul of the country.

Now what reason is it for a vacuum cleaner approach on
}a thing like that? Don't these instances illustrate how broad
informant intelligence really is, that would cause these groups

Mr. Wannall. Senator Wart, that was a case that was
opened on November 14 and closed November 20, and the informatiqn
which caused us to be interested in it were really.two particuldy
items. One was that’ a member of the Beer committee there
was a three man steering committee, and oné of those members
of the national conference was in fact a national officer
of the VVAW in whom we had suggested before we did. have a
legitimate investigative interest.:

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I would almost say so whht
at that point.

Mr. Wannall. The second report we ha@ was that the
VVAW would actively participate in an attempt to pack the
conference to take it over, And the third report we had --

Senator Hart of Michigan. And incidentally, all of the
information that your Buffalo informant had given you with
respect to the goals and aims of the VVAW gave you Z list of |

goals which were completely within Constitutionally protected

objectives. There wasn't a single item out of that VVAW that
jeopardizes the .security of this country at all.
Mc. Wannall. Well, of-course, we did not rely entirely

on the Buffalo informant, but even ‘there we did. recej™

from that informant information which I considered to be

significant.

The Buffalo chaptex* of the VVAW was the regional office .

covering New York and northern New Jersey: It was one ‘of the
five most active VVAW chapters’ in the country and ata
national conference, or at the regional conference, this
informant reported information hack to us that an attendee

at the conference announced that he had run guns into Cuba

prior to the Castro take-over. He himself said that he during |;

the Cuban crisis had been under 24 hour suveillance. There
was also discussion at the conference of subjugating the
VVAW to the revolutionary union. There were some individuals
in the chapter or the regional conference who were not in

agreement with us, but Mr, Adams has addressed himself to the

. interest of the revolutionary union,

So all of the information that we had on the vat did
not come from that source but even that particular source did
give us information which we considered to be of some
significance in our appraisal’ of the need for continuing the
investigation of that particular chapter of the vvAW,

Senator Hart of Michigan. _ But does it give you the
right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even
if it is a conference that might be taken over by the VVAW
when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we

seek to achieve unconditional’ amnesty? What threat?

Mr. Wannall. Our interest, of course, was the vvaAW
influence on a particular meéting, if you ever happened to be
holding a meeting, or whatever subject it was.

Senator Hart of Michigan, What if it was a meeting to

Seek to make more effective the food stamp system in this

country?

Mis Wantall. Well, of course ‘there “had been some _
organizations. ;

Senator Hart of Michigan. Would the same logic follow?

Mr. Wannail., I think that if we found that if the
Communist Party USA was going ‘to take over the meeting, and
use it asa front for its own purposes, there would be a logic
in doing that. You have a whole’ scope here “and it's a natter.
of where you, do and eee you. don't, and, hopefully, as wa've

committee but from the guidelines that are being developed.
But within the rationale of what we're doing today, I was
explaining to you our interest not in going to this thing and
not gathering everything there was about it.

In fact, only one individual attended and reported to us,
and that was the person who had, who was not developed for
this reason; an informant who had been reporting on other

matters for some period of time.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, my time has expired
but even this brief exchange, I think, indicates that if we
really want to control the dangers to our society of using
informants to gather domestic political intelligence, we have
to restrict sharply domestic intelligence investigations, And
that gets us into what I would like to raise-‘with you when

my turn comes around again, and that's the use of warrants,

obliging the Bureau to obtain a warrant before’a full-fledged

informant can be directed by the Bureau against a group or
individuals.

I know you have objections to that and I would like to
review that: with you.

Senator Mondale, pursue that question.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an
obligation to obtain a warrant before you turn [loose a full-
fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run
into you ox you run into, or who walk in as information sources
The Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the
Committee. The Bureau argues that such a warrant requirement
might be unconstitutional because it would violate the First

Amendment rights of FBI informants to communicate with their

government.

Now that's a concern for First Amendmént rights ‘that

ought to - hearten all the civil libertarians,

But why would that vary, why would a warrant requirement
raise a serious. constitutional question?

Mr. Adams. Well, for one thing it's the practicability
of it or ‘thé .impacticability ‘of ‘getting a warrant which:
ordinarily involves probable cause to: show that a crime has
been or is about to be committed.

In the intelligence field we ae dealing necessarily
with an imminent criminal action. We're dealing with activities
such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have
discussed before, where they say publicly we're not. to engage
‘in any violent activity today, but we guarantee you we still
subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time
is ripe, we're going to rise up and help overthrow the United
States,

Well, now, you can't show probable cause if they're about
to do it because they're telling you they're nok going to do it
and you know they're not going to do it at this particular
moment.

It's just: the mixture somewhat of trying to mix ina
criminal procedure with an intelligence gathering function, and
we can't find any practical way of doing it. We have a particular
organization. We may have an informant that not only belongs
to the Communist Party, but belongs to several other organization:
and as part of his function he me be sent out by the amindlst

Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.

It's just from our standpoint the possibility of informants,
the Supreme Court has held ‘that informants per se do not
violate the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendments. They have
recognized the necessity that the government has to have
individuals who will assist them in carrying out their ,
governmental duties,

Senator Hart of ‘Michigan. “I'm not sure I've heard anything
yet in response to the constitutional question, the very
practical question that you addressed.

Quickly, you are right that the court has said that the
use of the informant per se is not a violation of constitutiona]

Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much,

Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential
security informant and a security informant?

Mr. Wannall. I mentioned earlier, Senator Schweiker,

-that in developing an informant we do a preliminary check on

him before talking with him. and then we do a further in-depth
background check.

A potential security informant is someone who is under
consideration before he is approved by headquarters for use as”

an informant. He is someone who is under current consideration.

On some occasions that person will have been developed to a
point where he is in fact furnishing information and we fas

In some thecences he may be paid for ‘information furnishe a

ourselves that he meets all of our criteria. When he does, |
the field must submit its recommendations to headquarters, and
headquarters will pass upon whether that individual is an

Senator Schweiker. So it's really the first step of
being an informant, I guess.

Mr. Wannall.. It is a preliminary step, one of .the
preliminary steps,

Senator Schweiker. In the Rowe case, in:the Rowe

Mr. Wannall. Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address

fae @ 1926

About 1795, I guess, or some period like that, marshalls have
had.the authority that alinost. bordezs on what a sheriff,has.
We are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice
and during these times the Department of Justice had us maintasy
the role of an investigative agency. We were to ‘report on
activities to furnish the information to ‘the ‘local police, .
who had an obligation to, act. We furnished it to the pepartiient
of Justice. ;

In those areas where the local police did not act, it
resulted finally in the Attorney General sending 500 United
States marshalls down to guarantee the safety of people who
were trying to march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at a
time of civil righs versus federal rights, and yet there was
a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the country.

This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement agenciés

upon the information that was furnished to them, But we
have no authority to make an arrest on the spot because we
would not have had evidence that there was a-conspiracy
available. We can do absolutely nothing in that regard.

if any arrests need to be made, the Army should make them and

And over the years, as “you know,- at, the time there were hang

you do something about it?.

Well, we took the other route and effectively destroyed
the Klan as far as committing acts of violence, and of course
we exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

Senator Schweiker. What would be wrong, just following
up your point there, Mr.-Adams, with setting up a program .
sincé it's obvious to me that a lot of informers are going to
have pre-knowledge of.violence of using U.S. marshalls on some

place a year in advance with seaue officials, city officials,
the Department of Justice and the FBI sitting down together
saying, how are we going to protect the situation in Boston?

people at that time, : t

that they had all the information they needed to clamp down
on the conspiracy and could arrest people at that point in time,
and yet no arrests were made. ;

Why, Mr. Wannall, was this true?

Mr. Wannall. Well, I can answer that based oniy on ‘the
material that I have reviewed, Senator Schweiker. It was not
a case handled in my division but I think I can answer your.
question.

There was, in fact, a representative of the Department
of Justice on the spot counsel Ling and advising continuously |!
as that case progressed as to what soint eed should be

made and we’ were being guided by those to our mentors, the

ones who are responsible for making decisions of that sort..

there was someone in the Department there is perfectly true.

Senator Schweiker, That responsibility rests with who
under your procedures?

Mr. Wannall. We investigate decisions on making arrests,
when they should be made, and decisions with regard to
prosecutions are made either by the United states attorneys
lor by Federals in the Department. ;

Senator Schweiker. Well,.in this case, though, they

That's getting pretty close to conspiracy, it seems to
me. They had a dry run and they could have arrested them on

run. Who was this Departinent of Justice official who made
that decision?

Mr. Adams. Guy Goodwin was the Department official.

Senator Schweiker, Next I'd like to ask back in 1965,
during the height of the effort to destroy the Klan, as you
put it a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released
figures that we had ‘something like 2,000 informers of some
kind or another infiltrating the’ Klan out of roughly 10,000
estimated membership,

I believe these are either FBI figures or estimates.
That would mean that one out of every five members of the Kian
at that point was an informant paid by the government.

And I believe the figure goes once indicate that 70
percent of the new members of the Kla:. that year were PBI

informants. :

Isn't this an awfully overwhelming quantity of people .

going on for. pe eoa ones put: it, seems to mé that this is the

For example, today w we supposedly hohe only a eaaet te ti

informants. for, both donestic ‘informants. and potential eres atl

and that here’ we had 2; 000° just in the Klan alone.

Mr, Adams. Well, this number 2,000 did include all

-racial matters, informants at that particular time, and I

think the figures we tried to reconstruct as to the actual.
number of Klan informants in relation to Klan members was aroun
6 percent, I think, after we had read some of the- testimony.
Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan had a
group called the Action Group. ‘This was the group that you”
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony, that he was left af-
ter the meeting. He attended the open meetings and heard
all of the hurrahs and this type of thing from information,
but he never knew what was going on because each one had an
action group that went out and considered themselves in the
missionary field.
Theirs was the violence.
In order to penetrate those, it takes, you have to direct
as many informants as you possibly fn against it, Bear in

mind that I think the newspapers, the President and Congress ani

everyone’ is concerned about the murder of the civil rights
workers, the Linio Kent sase, the Viola Liuzzo case, the ;
bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were facéd with one
tremendous problem at that time,

Senator Schweiker. = acknowledge that.

Mr. Adams. our only approach was through informants
and through the use of informants we solved these cases, the
ones that were solved, Some of the bombing cases we have
never solved. They are extremely difficult. ~

These informants, as we told the Attorney General, and
as we told the President, that we had moved informants like
Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the bodyquard to the
head man. He was in a position where he could forewarn us
of violence, could help us on cases that had transpired, and
yet we knew and conceived that ‘this could continue forever
unless we can create enough disruption that these members will
realize that if I go out and murder three civil rights workers,
even though the sheriff and other law enforcement officers are
in on it, iff that were the case and with some of them it was
the case, that I would be caught. And that's what we did and
that's why violence stopped, was because the Klan was insecure
and just like you say, 20 percent, they thought 50 percent of
their members ultimately were Klan members and they didn't

dare engage in these acts of violence because they knew they

couldn't control the conspiracy any longer.

Senator Schweiker. My time is expired. I just have
one quick question,.

Is it correct that in 1971 we're using around 6500
informers for black ghetto situations?

Mr. Adams, I'm not sure if that's the year. We did
‘have one year where we had a number like that which probably
had been around 6000, and that was the time when the cities
were being burned, Detroit, Washington, areas like this.- We.
were given a mandate to know what the situation is, where is
violence going to break out, what next?

They weren't informants like an individual penetrating
an organization. They were listening posts in the community
that would help tell us that we have a passant here that's getting
ready to start another fire-fight or something.

Senator Tower, At this point, there are three more
Senators remaining for questioning. If we can try to et

everything in in the first round, we will not have a second

round and I think we can finish around 1:00, and we can. go
on and terminate the proceedings.
However, Tf anyone feels that they have another question
that they want to return to, we can come back here by 2:00.
Senator Mondale? :

don't have probable cause to investigate anyone, but you can
direct an intelligence operation against the German-American
Bund, the same thing we did after Congress said -- ,
Senator Mondale, Couldh!t you get a warrant for that?

probable cause to investigate an organization.

chave bungled the intelligence operations in the United States.
I agree with you that we have made some mistakes. Mr. Kelley.
has set a pattern of being as forthright as any Director of the
FBI in acknowledging mistakes that. had been made, but I think
that as you said, and I’ believe Senator Tower said, and
Senator Church, that we have to watch these hearings because
of the necessity that we must concentrate on these areas of
.abuse. We must not lose sight of the

overall law enforcement and intelligence community, and I
still feel that this is the freest country in the world.

I've travelled much, as I'm sure you have, and I know we have
made some mistakes, but I feel that the people in the United
States are less chilled by the mistakes we have made than they
are by the fact that there are 20,000 murders a year in the
United States and they can't walk out of their hones at night
and feel safe. ;

argument then, Mr. Adams, for strengthening our powers to go
after those who commit crimes rather than strengthening bel

I think I sense an agreement that the FBI has gotten into trouble

need to have new legal standards.

Mr. Adams. Yes, t agree with that.

Senator Tower. Senator Huddleston.

Senator Huddleston, Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Adams, these two instances we have studied at: some
length seems to have been an : inclination on the part of
the Bureau to establish, a notion about an individual or a group
which seems to be very hard to ever change or dislodge. in
the case of Dr. King, where the supposition was that he was
being influenced by Communist individuals, extensive investi-
gation was made, surveillance, reports came back indicating a
this in fact was untrue, and directions continued to go out
to intensify the investigation. There never seemed to be a
willingness on the part of the Bureau to accept its own facts.

Ms. Cook testified this Moning that something similar
to that happened with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, that
every piece of information that she supplied to the Bureau
seemed to indicate that the Bureau was. not correct in its
assumption that this organization planned to commit violence,
or that it was being manipulated, and yet you seemed to insist

Now, are there instances where the Bureau has admitted that

five days we closed the case. We were told something by-an

situation there was no testimony to the effect that we just

Mr. Adams. I don't think they made any such statement

can think of around 20 informants that we have prosecuted for

to show you our policy of disseminating information on violence
inthis case, during the review of the matter, the agents told
me that they found one case where their agent had been working

24 hours a day, and he was a little late in disseminating the

but it showed up in a file review, and he was censured for

his delay in properly notifying local authorities.

So we not only have a policy, I feel that we do follow
reasonable safeguards.in order to carry it out, including periodic
review of all informant. files.

Senator Huddleston, Well, Mr. Rowe's statement is
substantiated to some extent with the acknowledgement by the
agent in charge that if you're going to be a Klansman and you

happen to be with someone and they decide to.do something, that

and be a good informant. He wouldn't take the lead, but the
implication is that he would have to go along and would have
to be involved if he was going to maintain his credibility.

’ Mr. Adams.. There's no question but that an informant at :
times. will have to be. present. during demonstrations, riots,

fistfights that take place, but I believe his statement was

room and I don't recall it exactly, but some of them were
beat with chains, and I-didn't hear whether he said he beat
someone with a chain or not, but I rather doubt that he did
because it's one thing being present, and it's another thing
taking an active part in criminal actions.

Senator Huddleston. He was close enough to get his
throat cut.

How does the gathering of information --

Senator Tower. Senator Mathias is here, and I think that
we probably should recess a few minutes.

Could we have Senator Mathias' questions and then should
we convene this afternoon?

Senator Huddleston. I'm finished. I just had one more :
question.

Senator ‘Tower. Go ahead.

Senator Huddleston. I wanted to ask how the selection of
information about an individual's personal life,.social, sex
life and -becoming involved in that sex life or social life
is a requirement for law enforcement or crime prevention.

Mr. Adams. Our agent handlers have advised us on Mr.

Rowe, that they gave him no such instruction, they had no

such knowledge ‘concerning it, and I can see’ where it would

be.of any value whatsoever.

Senator Huddleston. You aren't avere of any case where

if a person wants to tell an informant something that isn't
protected by the Supreme Court.

An actual search for legal evidence, that is a protected
item, but ‘information and the use of informants have been
consistently held as not posing any constitutional problems.

Senator Mathias. I would agree, if you're talking about
the fellow who walks in off the street, as I said earlier,
but is it true that under existing Hidedadaldg informants are
given background checks?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. And they are subject to a testing period

Mr. Adams. That's right, to verify and make sure they
are providing to us reliable information. |

Senator Mathias. And during the period that the relation-
ship continues, ‘they are rather closely controlled by the

“Mr. Adams, That's true.

Senator Mathias. So in effect they can come in a very
practical way agents themselves to the FBI.:

Mr. Adams.. They can do nothing --

Senator Mathias. Certainly agents in the common law use
of the word.

Mr. Adams. That's right, they can do nothing, and we

Mr. Adams, The main difficulty is the particularity
which has to be shown in obtaining a search warrant. You
have to go after particular evidence. You have to specify
what you're going after, and an informant operates in an
area that you just cannot specify. He doesn't know what's
- going. to be discussed at ‘that meeting. It may be a plot to
blow up the Capitol again or it may be a plot to blow up the
State Department building. . : ;

Senator Mathias, If it were a criminal investigation,
you would have little difficulty with probable cause, wouldn't
you? : :

Mr. Adams. We would have difficulty in a warrant to
use someone as.an informant in that area because the same
difficulty of particularity exists. We can't specify.

Senator Mathias. I understand the problem because it's

very similar to one that we discussed earlier in connection
say wiretaps on a national security problem.
Mr. Adams. That's it, and there we face the problem of

where the Soviet, an individual identified as a Soviet spy

in a friendly country and they tell us he's been a Soviet spy
there and now he's coming to the United States, and if we can't

show under a probable cause warrant, if we couldn't show that

he was actually ehgaging in espionage in the United States,

we couldn't get a wiretap under the probable cause requirements

which have been discussed, If the good fairy didn "e drop the

evidence in our hands that this individual is here conducting
espionage, we again would fall short of this, and that's :
why we're still groping with it.

Senator Mathias. When you say fall short, you really,
you would be. falling short of the requirements of the Fourth
Amendment.

Mr. Adams. That's right, except for the fact that the
President, under this Constitutional powers, to protect this
nation and make sure that it survives first, first: of all
national survival, and these are the areas that not only the
President but the Attorney General are concerned in and we're
all hoping that somehow we can reach a legislative middle
ground in here,

Senator Mathias. Which we discussed in the other nationa}

security area as to curtailling a warrant to that particular
need.

Mr. Adams. And if you could get away from probable
cause and get some degree of reasonable cause and get some
‘method of sealing indefinitely your interest, say, in an
ongoing espionage case and can work out those difficulties,
we may get their yet.

Senator Mathias. And you don't despair of finding that
middle ground? :

Mr. Adams. I don't because I think that ‘today there's’

more of an open mind between Congress and the Executive Branch

ana the FBI and everyone concerning the need to get these
areas resolved,

Senator Mathias. And you believe that the Department,
if we could come together, would support, would agree nn that
kind of a warrant requirement if we could agree on the language7

Mr. Adams. If we can work out problems and the Attorney
General is personally interested in that also.

Senator Mathias. Do you think that this agreement might °
extend to some of those other areas. that we talked about?

Mr. Adams. I think that that would be a much greater
difficulty in an area of domestic intelligence informant who
reports on many different operations and different types of

activities that might come up rather than say in a Soviet

espionage or, a foreign espionage case where you do have a littl

more degree of specificity to deal with.

; Senator Mathias. I suggest that we arrange to get
together and try out some drafts with each other, but in the
meantime, of course, there's another alternative and that
would be the use of wiretap procedure by which the Attorney
General must approve a wiretap before it is placed, “and the
same general process could be used for informants, since
you ot to headquarters any way.

major abuses of Congress and get over this hurdle, I think

we're still going to have to recognize that heads of agencies
have to accept the responsibility for managing that agency
and we can't just keep pushing every operational problem up
to the top-because there just aren't enough hours in the’day.

Senator Mathias. But the reason that parallel suggests -
itself is of course the fact that the wiretap deals generally
with one level of information in one aense of gathering
information. You hear what you hear from the tap.

Mr. Adams, But you're dealing in a much smaller number
also,

Senator Mathias. Smaller number, but that's all .the

more reason. When an informant goes in, he has all of his

senses. He's gathering all of the information a human being
can acquire from a situation and has access to more information
than the average wiretap. ,

: And it would seem to me that for that reason a.parallel
process might be useful ‘and in order,

Mr. Adams. Mr. Mintz _pointea out one other main
aistinction . to me which I had overlooked from our prior
discussions, which is the fact that with an informant he is
more. in the position of being a concentral monitor in that one
of the two parties to the conversation agrees, such as like
concentral monitoring of telephones and microphones and

anything else versus the wiretap itself where the individual

whose telephone is being tapped is not aware and there is,
and neither of the two parties talking had agreed that their

conversation could be monitored.

Senator Mathias. I find that one difficult to accept.
If I'm the third party overhearing a conversation that is taking
place in a room where I am, and my true character isn't perceived
by the two people who are talking, in effect they haven't ,
consented to my overhearing my conversation. Then they consent
if they believe that I am their friend or their, a partisan
of theirs. ,

But if they knew in fact that I was an informant for
someone else, they wouldn't be consenting.

Mr. Adams. Well, that's like I believe Senator, Nart
raised earlier, that the courts thus far have made this

distinction with no difficulty, but that doesn't mean that

addressed,
Senator Mathias. Well, I particularly appreciate your

attitude in being willing to work on these problems because

I think that's the most important thing that can evolve from
these hearings, so that we can actually look at the Fourth
Amendment as the standard that we-have ts achieve. But the
way we get there is obviously going to i “a lot easier if we
can work toward them together.

_ the use of informants and the kind of information that they
collect.

Do you feel that ‘this ‘would be too restrictive?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir, I do.

When I look at informants and I see that each year
informants provide us, locate 5000 dangerous fugitives, they
provide subjects in 2000 more cases, they SIRnIE $86 million
in stolen property and contraband, and that's irrespective
of what we give the lecal law enforcement and other Federal
agencies, which is almost a comparable figure, we have almost

we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure

us to be aware of the daentity of individuals and organizations
that are acting to overthrow the government of the United

It's here to say. It's been here throughout history "°
and there will always be informants. And the thing we want to
avoid is abuses. like provacateurs, criminal activities, and
to ensure that we have safeguards that will prevent that.

But we do need informants.

questions?

Senator Hart of Michigan. Yes. I ask unanimous request
perhaps with a view to giving balance to the record, the
groups that we have discussed this morning into which the
Bureau has put informants, in popular language, our liberal
groups -~ I would ask unanimous consent that .be printed in

that he was organizing a group to counter the American Civil

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
ee Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation

extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have. consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital smportancd
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather
than on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light

in our hearings occurred years and even decades before Directot

Kelley took charge.
The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli
gence operations, and less on purely domestic ‘surveillance.
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in

developing policies and standards for intelligence. These

are welcome developments.

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved,
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-}|
lance should Seana beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certai:
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance techniques;
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.

The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY ,

DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and
gentlemen. :

I welcome the interest which this Committee has shown in
the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli
gence and internal security fields.

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same ae
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.

This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as
possible in responding to your questions and complying with your

requests.

I believe we have livea up to those promises.

The members and staff of this Committee hase had unprece-
dented access to FBI information.

You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-type|
investigations and who are personally involved in every facet
of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who
have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with
all major areas of our activities and operations in the nationall
security and intelligence fields.

In brief, you have had firsthand examination of these
matters that is unmatched at any time in the history of the
Congress.

As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of
necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I
eredit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's
record of performance.

It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus
on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
organization.

The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the
lion's share of public attention and’ crjtical comment constitu
an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's Counterintelligence
Programs has reported that in the five basic ones it- found
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,

less than three fourths, were approved.

I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were
being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era
when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative
matters per year.

Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate
and understandable.

The question might well be asked what I had in mind when
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..

What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is
that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what nes
felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney General,
the Congress, and the people of the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such

acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,
and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights. :

There were many calls for action from Members of Congress
and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and other
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to countér conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may well
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet

an imminent threat: to human life or property.

in the decision-making process which insures that no future
program or major policy decision will ever be adopted without a
full and critical review of its propriéty.

Participatory management has become a fact in the FBI.

I have made it known throughout our Headquarters and
Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, feeceralece of
position or degree of experience, to contribute their thoughts
and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms or
reservations they may have concerning any area of our. operations.

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. “My goal is to achieve maximum
critical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure.

The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outsid
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's [
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, “as a ‘lightning rod' to deflect improper requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,

considering the context of the request, I believed presented

the appearances of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I have to the
Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years a
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no
one has approached me or made overtures, directly or otherwise,
to use the FBI for partisan political or other improper
purposes.

I can assure you that I would not for a moment consider
honoring any such request.

I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI
I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney General and

the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including

those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and|
practices. These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the.FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means...

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the
character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

I am-proud of the 19,000 men and women with whom it is
my honor to serve today. Their dedication, their professionali}

demand of themselves and expect of their associates are the
nation's ultimate assurance of proper and responsible conduct
at all times by the FBI.

The Congress and the members of this Committee in
particular have gained a great insight into. the. problems
confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields,
problems which all too often we have left to resolve without
sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or the Congress
itself.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even
to the Executive Branch.

The Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised.

An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully
committed to maximum participation with the members of that
Subcommittee.

I laud their efforts. However, those efforts are of very
recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.

One of the greatest benefits of the study this Committee
has made is the expert knowledge you have gained of the complex

problems confronting the FBI. But I respectfully submit that

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police officer, a
career police officer. In‘’my police experience, the must
frustrating of all problems that I have discovered facing
law enforcement in this country, Federal, state, and local, is
when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.

It must be sufficiently flexible that it does not stifle
the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly address the demonstrated problems of the past;
yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times change and

so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive

The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced

question the need for intelligence gathering, suggesting that
information needed for the prevention of Stee can be
acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations.

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence
for prosecution. Since the investigation normally follows
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of

information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well be

not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government: has enough information to meet any future crisis

or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also wheth
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the

means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on

our anticipation of those criminal acts, Anticipation,

in turn, is dependent on advance information, that is, intelli-|

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues,
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need
for intelligence work can be documented to the full PPA
of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is not
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee or
its successors in this important task.

In a event, you have my unqualified assurance as
Director that we will carry out both the letter and the spirit
of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

That is the substance of my prepared statement.

- I would also like to say extemporaneously that I note
that on this panel are some gentlemen who were on the Judiciary
Committee Which heard my testimony at the time I was presented
to them for candidacy as Director of the FBI. At that time
I took very seriously the charge which may possibly result
in the deliberation of this Committee and of the full Senate.
I have been well aware of the problems of the FBI since that

time. I have also been well aware of the capabilities of

the FBI to discharge those responsibilities. I don't take

them lightly. I am of sufficient experience and age that I
have pledged myself to do what is good and proper. I say this
not as a self-serving statement mae in order that we might
place in context my position within the FBI. I could seek
sanctuary and perhaps a safe sanctuary by saying during the
period these things occurred I was with the local police -
department in Kansas City, Missouri. Prior to that time,
however, I was in the FBI.

During the time I was with the FBI, during the time I
was with the police department, I continued throughout that
period a close acquaintance with and a strong affection for
the FBI.

I only want to point out that based on those years, based
on those observations, we have here a very fine and very
sensitive and a very capable organization. I feel that there
is much that can still be done. I know that we are not without
fault. I know that from those experiences I have had. .We
will not be completely without fault in the future. But I
assure you that we look upon this inquiry, we look upon any
mandate which you may feel you have, that you should look at -;
this is good and proper, and we do not intend -- I only want
to place in your thinking the fact that you have here a
matchless organization, one which I continue to say was
not motivated in some of these instances, and in most of

them, and I cannot justify some, that the motivation was of eh

Senator Hart of Michigan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Mathias and I have Judiciary Committee hearings at 10:3).
Iahve several questions, and I'm sure they'll be

covered by others, but the ones that I have is a result of
reading your testimony and listening to it this morning, and
it relates to your comment at the foot of Bee Y, and at the
top of 11. 7

There you are indicating that you caution us about
extending the court's role in the early stages of investigationp
suggesting that this might take us beyound the role comtemplaetef
for the courts under the Constutution.

Now as you have said, aside from the so-called national
security wiretap problem, the main focus of our discussions
and concern has been on the possibility requiring court
approval for the use of informants, informants directed to
penetrate and report on some group.

And one of the witnesses yesterday, Professor Dorsen,
pointed our that really those informants are the most pervasive’
type of an eavesdropping device. It is a human device. It's
really, an informant is really more intrusive on my privacy
than a bug or a tap because he can follow me anywhere. He
can ask me questions to get information the government would
like to have.

Now we certainly involve the courts in approval of the

wiretaps for physical searches with the intent of the drafters

of the Constitution to have a- neutral third party magistrate
screen use of certain investigative techniques. And the
informant is such a technique. He functions sort of like a
general warrant, and I don't see why requiring court approval
would violate the role envisaged for the courts.

And as I leave, I would like to get a reactions re e
my feelings.

Mr, Kelley. I do not feel that there is any use of the
informant in intrusion, which is to this extent objectionable,
It has of course been approved, the concept of the informant,
by numerous court decisions.

Let us go down not to the moral connotation of the use
of the informant,

I think, as in many cases, that is a matter of balance.
You have only very few ways of solving crimes. You have
basically in the use of the informant, I think, the protectian
of the right of the victim to be victimized. You have within
the Constitution certain grants that are under ordinary
circumstances abrogation of rights. The right of search and
seizure, which, of course, can't be unreasonable, but none-
theless, you have “the right.

I think that were we to lose the right of the informant,
we would lose to a great measure our capability of doing our
job.

Now I'm not arguing with you, Senator, that it is not an

‘unusual procedure. I'm not even going to say that it is not
an intrusion, because it is. But it has to a one I think
that is by virtue of the benefits must be counted.

We don't like to use it. We don't like the problems that
are attendant. We take great care.

Now you say about the court having possibility taking
jurisdiction over them and guiding. I think that possibly we
could present the matter to the court but what are they going
to do insofar as monitoring their effort? Are they going to
have to follow it all the way through?

Also, there is, of Sates urgency in the other contacts.
Must the court be contacted for each and approval of the court
given for each contact? ,

There are a great many problems insofar as administration
of it.

I frankly feel, and again, all I can do is give you my
idea -- I frankly feel that there is a satisfactory control ovey
the informants as we now exercise it today. Yes, there are
going to be some who will get beyond our control, but this
is going to happen no matter what you do.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I appreciate your
reaction.

I was not suggesting that there is consideration here -to
prohibit informants. I was reflecting a view that I felt and

hold that the use of an informant does require some balance, as

you yourself said, and I would be more comfortable with a i
ehira party making a judgment as to whether the intrusion is
warranted by the particular circumstance. But I do understand
your position.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hart.

(Senator Hart leaves the hearing room.)

The Chairman. Senator Baker, do you have questions?

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

Mr. Kelley, I have a great respect-for you and your
organization and I personally regret that the organization is
in political distress, but we've both got to recognize that
it is, along with other agencies and departments of the
government.

I think you probably would agree with me that even though
that is extraordinarily unpleasant and in many respects
unfortunate, that it also has a plus side. That is, it gives
us an indication of our future direction and the opportunity,
at least, to improve the level of competency and service of
the government itself.

With that hopeful note, would you be agreeable then to
volunteering for me any suggestions you have on how to improve
the responsiveness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or
indeed, for any other law enforcement agencies of the government,

to the Congress, to the Attorney General, to the President, and

ve And before you answer, let me tell you two or three thing
8 I am concerned about.
9 It hasn't been long ago that the FBI Director was not

10 even confirmed by the Senate of the United States. I believe
11 you are the first one to be confirmed hy the Senate of the
12 United States. I think that is a movement in the right

13 direction. I think the FBI has taken on a stature that, an

16 At the same time I rather doubt that we can become

17 involved in the daily relatianship between you and the Attorney

19 Therefore, I tend to believe that the Attorney General

20 || needs to be more directly involved in the operations of the

22 I would appreciate any comments on that.

I don't think you can have oversight unless you have
access to records, and in many cases records don't exist
and in some cases the people who made those decisions are now
departed and in other cases you have conflicts.

How would you suggest: then that you improve the quality
of service of your agency? How would you propose that you

increase the opportunity for oversight of the Congress of the

the level of law enforcement in the essential activity that
is required? ,

Mr. Kelley. I would possibly be repetitious in answering
this Senator, but I get a great deal of pleasure from telling
what I think is necessary and what I hope that I have followed,
one which is beyond my control, but which I think is very
important is that the position of Director, the one to which
great attention should be paid in choosing the man who will
properly acquit himself.

I feel that the Judiciary Committee, at least in going
over me, did a pretty good job. I feel that it is most
necessary that care be taken that his philosophy, his means
of management, his facility to adapt to change, his tendency

toward consulting with other members of the official family,

that he be willing to, for example, go through oversight with
no reticence, and that I think that he should be chosen very
carefully.

I think further that he should be responsible for those
matters which indicate impropriety or illegality.

Senator Baker. Could you stop for just a second? Who
does he work for? Does the Director, in your view, work for
the President of the United States, for the Attorney General,
for the Justice Department, for the Executive Branch?’

Who does the executive of the FBI, the Director of the
PBI, be responsible to, who should he be responsible to?

Mr. Kelley. Jurisdictionally, to the Attorney General,
but I think this is such an important field of influence that
it is not at all unlikely that we can expand it to the
judiciary, the legislative, and of course, we are under the
Attorney General.

Senator Baker. Do you have any problems with the idea
of the President of the United States calling the Director of
the FBI and asking for performance of a particular task?

Does that give you any difficulty? Or do you think that
the relationship between the FBI Director and the President
is such that that is desirable, or should it be conduited
through the Attorney General?

Mr. Kelley. I think it should be in the great majority

of the cases conduited through the Attorney General. There

has been traditionally some acceptance of the fact that if
the President wants to see and talk with the Director, he
may do so, call him directly.

It has been my practice in such an event to thereafter
report to the Attorney General, whoever it might be, that I
have been called over and I discussed and was ‘told. And this
was revealed in full to them,

Senator Baker. I suppose we could pass a statute that
says the President has to go through the Attorney General,
although I rather ‘suspect it would be a little presumptuous.

But to go the next step, do you think it is necessary
for the pursuit of effective oversight on the part of the
Congress, to have some sort of document written, a at least
some sort. of account of a Presidential order or an order of
the Attorney General given to a Director of the FBI?

Do you think that these things need to be handled in
a-more formal way?

Mr. Kelley. Personally, it would be my cunere in
the event I receive such an order, to request that it be
documented. This is a protection as well as a clarification
as to whether or not it should be placed as part of legislation.
I frankly would like to reserve that for some foe considera-
tion.

I don't know whether it would be, but I think that it

can be worked very easily. '

Senator Baker. Mr. Kelley, Attorney General Levi, I
believe, has already established some sort of agency or
function within the Department fn is serving as the equivalent
I suppose, of an Inspector General of the Justice Department,
including the FBI.

Are you familiar with the steps that Mr. Levi has
taken in that respect? I think he calls it the Office of
Professional Responsibility. :

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir, I'm familiar with it.

Senator Baker. Do you have any comment on that? Will
you give us any observations as to whether you think that
will be useful, helpful, or whether it will not be useful or
helpful, how it affects the FBI, how you visualize your
relationship: to it in the future?

Mr. Kelley. I don't object to this, which is to some
extent an oversight within the Department of Justice under the
Attorney General.

Frankly, it just came out. I have not considered it
completely, but to the general concept, yes, I very definitely
subscribe.

Senator Baker. How would you feel about extending that
concept of government-wide operation, a national Inspector
General who is involved with an oversight of all of the
agencies of to cermmeat as they interface with the Constitutional]

Hr. Kelley. Senator; I don't contemplate it might be
a continuing danger, but it certainly would be. a very acceptable
guidepost whereby we can, in the event such a need seems
to arise, know what we can do.

Senator Huddleston. Well, in pursuing the area which
Senator Hart was discussing, that is whether or not we can
provide sufficient guidelines would replace a decision by the

court in determining what action might be proper and specific -

provide the restrictions and guidelines and the various
techniques that might be used?

For -instance, supposing we do establish the fact, as
has already been done, that informants are necessary and
desirable. flow do we keep that informant operating within the
proper limits so that he in fact is not violating individual
rights?

Mr. Kalley. Well, of course, much of the reliance must
be placed on the agent and.the supervision of the FBI to assure
that there is no infringement of rights.

Senator Huddleston. But this is an aware we've gotten
into some difficulty in the past. We have assumed that the
particular action was necessary, that there was a present

threat that some intelligence programs should be initiated, but

in many cases it has gone beyond what would appear to have been
necessary to have addressed the original threat.

How do we keep within the proper balance there?

Mr. Kelley. Well,.actually, it's just about like any
other offense. It is an invasion of the other individual's
right and it is by an officer and an FBI agent is an officer.
There's the possibility of eriminal prosecution against him.

This is one which I think might flow if he counsels”
the informant.

Now insofar as his inability to control the informant,

I don't suppose that would warrant prosecution, but there is
still supervisory control over that agent and over that
informant by insisting that control is exercised on a continuing
basis.

Senator Huddleston. It brings up an interesting point
as to whether or not a law enforcement agency ought to be
very alert to any law violations of its sa members or anyone
else.

If a White House official asks the FBI or someone to do
something unlawful, the question seems to me to occur as to
whether or not that is not a violation that should be reported
by the FBI.

Mr. Kelley. I think that any violation which comes to
our attention should either be handled by us or the proper

authority.

of unlawful activity taking place in various projects that
have been undertaken, which certainly were not brought to

range of threats, how do we control what happens Sarpy each
of those actions to keep them from going beyond are

Mr. Kelley. You're still speaking of informants.

Senator Huddleston. Not only informants but the agente
themselves as they go into surveillance, wiretaps, or whatever
intelligence gathering techniques.

The original thrust of my question was, even though we
may be able to provide guidelines of a broad nature, how do
we control the techniques that might be used, that int themselves
might be used, that in themselves might be a serious violation
of the rights.

Mr. Kelley. Well, first, I don't know whether it's
germane to your question but I do feel that it should be pointed
out that the association to, the relationship between the
informant and his agent handler is a very Bere Peer one,
and I doubt very seriously whether we could have any guide-
lines, where there might be an extension of any monitors here
because thereby you do have a destruction of that relationship,
Insofar as thé activities of agents, informants’ or others
which may_be illegal, we have on many occasions learned of
violations of the law on the part of informants, and either
prosecuted ourselves, through the reporting of it to the
United States Attorney, or turned it over to the local see
We have done this on many a time, many occasions. Insofar
aS our own personnel, we have an internal organization, the
Inspection Division, which reviews this type of activity, and

if there be any violation, yes, no question about it, we would

pursue it to the point of prosecution.

Senator Huddleston. But it could be helped by periodic
review. :

Mr. Kelley. We do, on an annual basis, review the
activities of our 59 offices through that same Inspection
Division, and they have a clear charge to go over this as well
as ‘other matters.

Senator Huddleston. Mr. Kelley, you pointed. out the
difference in the approaches when gathering intelligence, in
gathering evidence after a crime has been committed.

Would there be any advantage, or would it be feasible to

attempt to separate these functions within the Agency, in the

departments, for instance, with not aa a mixing of
gathering intelligence and gathering evidence? Are the techni —_
definable and different?+
Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think they are compatible. I
see no objection to the way that they are now being handled
on a management basis. I think, as a matter of fatt, it is
a very fine association whereby the intelligence, stemming as
it does from a substantive violation, is a natural complement.
Senator Huddleston. Now, another area, the FBI furnishes
information to numerous government agencies.
Is this properly restricted and controlled at the present
time in your judgment as to just who can ask the FBI for

information, what kind of information they can ask for, and

probably even more importantly, what restrictions can be put
on the use of that information once it has been supplied by

Mr. Kelley. I think so, Senator.

Senator Huddleston. You think there are proper restrictia:
now?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know that we can ourselves judge
in all cases whether or not there is good and sufficient reason
for an Agency to inquiry. I think that there should be a
very close delineation by the agencies as to what they're
going to ask for, but I think that we do have sufficient rules
that at least to us we are satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. You're confident that the informatio
your agency supplies is not being misused, to the detriment
of the rights of any individuals.

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I'm only confident in what I
do myself. I would say that I am satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. I was wondering whether some
inclusion ought to be made in whatever charter is made as to
who specifically can request, what limits ought to be placed
on what the request, and what they can do with it after they
get it.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Senator Huddleston. I have some concern about the fact

that in intelligence gathering, you gather, you are just

bound to gather a great deal of information about some
individual that is useless as far as the intent of the intelli-
gence gathering is concerned, but might be in some way embarras-
sing or harmful to the individual, whether or not there's any
effort to separate this kind of information out of a person's
file that is really initiated for a purpose, for a specific
purpose unrelated to this information.

Is there any effort, or could any direction be given to
doing that?

Mr. Kelley. We would be very happy to work under the
guidelines or rules or anything else to purge material which
is extraneous, irrelevant, or for any other reason objection-
able.

Senator Huddleston. And how about the length of time
that these files are kept in the agency?

Mr. Kelley. We are willing to work within that framework,
too.

Senator Huddleston. I think that might be done.

Now, I think in developing the chain of command, so to
speak, it certainly would be very difficult to prevent the
President of the United States from calling up the head of
the FBI or anyone else and discussing any law enforcement
problem he might so desire, and perhaps even give direction
to the agency.

But how about that? What about White House personnel

E 3 Could there be some clearcut understanding as to whether

6 Mr. Kelley. It's very clear to me that any request must
9 come from Mr, Buchen's office, and that it be, in any case,

8 wherein it is a request for action, that it be followed with

9 a letter so requesting.

10 This has come up before during the Watergate hearings, as

present activities. I think this. is the only way that we can
exchange our opinions and get accomplished what you want to
accomplish and what I want to accomplish.

Senator Huddleston. I feel that is an important aspect
of it because even though you have a charter which gives broad
direction for all the guidelines and to the types of projects
that enter into it, if we don't get down to specifics, such
things as how intelligence is to be collected, how evidence
is to be collected, what is done after it is collected, this
‘type of thing, it seems to me we are leaving a wide gap
again for the Bureau to assume that it has total instruction
and total permission to move in a certain a oeciaa and go
beyond what is intended or what was authorized.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Director.

The Chairman. Senator Goldwater?

Senator Goldwater. Mr. Kelley, as part of the FBI
electronic surveillance of Dr. King, several tapes of
specific conversations, and later a composite King tape were
produced.

Are these tapes still in the possession of the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by you?

Mr. Kelley. No, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by any of your

staff, to your knowledge?

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think = they have been reviewed]
I know that at least some have reviewed it within the area of
this particular section. There has been no review of them
since I came to the FBI, I can tell you that.

Senator Goldwater. Would these tapes be available to
the Committee if the Committee felt they would like to hear
them?

Mr. Kelley. This, Senator Goldwater, is a matter which is
of, as I said before, some delicacy, and there would have to i
be a discussion of this in an executive session.

The Chairman. I might say in that connection that the
Committee staff gave some consideration to this matter and
decided that it would compound the original error for the
staff to review the tapes, because that would be a still
further invasion of privacy, and so the staff refrained from
insisting on obtaining the tapes, believing that it was
unnecessary, and quite possibly improper, in order to get at
what,we needed to know about the King case.

So the staff did refrain, and for that reason the issue
never came to a head. I just wanted to lay that information
before the Senator.

Senator Goldwater. I realize that's a prerogative of
the staff, but it's also the prerogative of the Committee if,

and I'm not advocating it, if we wanted to hear them to

6 Mr. Kelley. I don't think it would be within my juris-
7 diction to respond to this, Senator. It would have to be the
8 Attorney General.
9 Senator Goldwater. I see.
10 Now, are these tapes and other products of surveillance
i || routinely retained even after an individual ceased to be a

: 13 Mr. Kelley. "they are retained usually for ten years.
i 14 Senator Goldwater. Ten years.
15 Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.
16 Senator Goldwater. What is the future value, if any,
WW to the Bureau of retaining such information?

12 Senator Mondale. Mr. Director, it seems to me that the

13 most crucial question before the Congress is to accept the

WARD & PAUL

14 invitation of the FBI to draw Congressionally imposed lines,
15 limits of authority so the FBI will know clearly what you can
16 and cannot do, so you will not be subject to later judgments,
17 and the question is, where should that line be drawn?

18 As you know, in 1924 when the FBI was created, and

19 Mr. Stone later became the Chief Justice, he drew the line at
20 criminal law enforcement. He said that never again will we
21 | ‘go beyond the authority-imposed upon us to get into political
22 ideas. We will stay in the area of law enforcement.

23 Would you not think it makes a good deal of sense to

24 draw the guidelines in a way that your activities are

erime, investigations of conspiracies to commit crime rather
than to leave this very difficult to define and control area
of political ideas?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know whether I understand your last
statement of involving the area of political ideas. I say that
I feel that certainly we should be vested and shoula continue
in the field of criminal investigations as an investigatory
objective. These are conclusions, of course, which are based
on statutes in the so-called security field, national or
foreign.

These are criminal violations. I feel that they should
be in tandem. I feel, having worked many years in this
atmosphere, that you have more ears and eyes and you have
more personnel working together, covering the same fields..

I do not think there should be a separation of the intelligence
Matters, because it is a concomitant. It naturally flows

from the investigation of the security matters and the
criminal.

Senator Mondale. Mr. Kelley, what'Mr. Stone said was:
this, that the Bureau of investigation is not concerned
with political or other opinions of individuals. It is
concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws
of the United States. When the police system goes beyond
these limits, it is dangerous to proper administration of

justice and human liberty.

Ps 2 Mr. Kelley. I think that life has become much more

9 intelligence is something which has proved to be at times
8 troublesome and given us great concern, but it is a viable,
9 productive procedure.

10 I don't know what Mr. Stone was thinking of entirely

11 of this course, but I can tell you about the procedure today.
12 Senator Mondale. You see, I think you recognize, if

that would provide any basis for oversight? :

How can ‘you, from among other things, be peste des from
criticism later on that you exceeded your authority or didn't
do something that some politician tried to pressure you into
doing?

Mr. Kelley. It might well be, Senator, that ten years
from now a Director of the FBI will be seated here and will be
eriticized for doing that which today is construed as very
acceptable.

Senator Mondale. Correct. And I have great sympathy
for the predicament the FBI finds itself in.

Mr. Kelley. And the Director.

Senator Mondale. And the Director especially, and that is
why I think it's in the interest of the FBI to get these lines
as sharply defined as possible, so that when you are pressured
to do things, or when, after the fact, people with good 20/20
hindsight can criticize you or the Bureau, that you can say
well, here are the standards that you gave us, and they specifig-
ally say this, and that is your answer. We have to live by
the law. If we don't define it specifically,it seems to me
that these excesses could reoccur, because I don't think it's
possible to define them, and the FBI is inevitably going to
be kicked back and forth, depending on personal notions of what
you should have done.

Don't you fear that?

Mr. Kelley. Not too much, Senator. I think we learned a
great lesson by virtue of Watergate, the revelations that have
come up as a result of this Committee's inquiries, the fact
that I think that we have a different type of spirit today
in the Bureau, the fact that, as I said before, you came in,
that I think the Bureau is a matchléss organization, and they
are eager to do that which is vital and proper, and the fact
that we are getting a number of very fine young people in the
organization, people of the other ethnic backgrounds than we
had years ago. I think there is a greater understanding in
the Bureau today of what is the proper type of conduct.

We may not be able to project this on all occasions,
because we must equate this with the need and with our
experience, but if the precise guidelines be the goal, you're
going to have trouble. If, on the other hand, there be a
flexibility, I think that we can work very well within those
guidelines.

Senator Mondale. I think, as you know, I don't think
there is a better trained or higher professionally qualified
law enforcement organization in the world than the FBI. I
think we all agree it is superb. But the problem has been,
from time to time, that when you go beyond the area of
enforcing the law into the area of political ideas, that you
are subject to and in fact you leave the criminal field, you

get into politics. And that is where, it seems to me, that tnd

great controversy exists, and.where you are almost inevitably
going to be subjected to fierce criticism in the future, no
matter how you do it. Once you get into politics, you get
into trouble.

Mr. Kelley. I agree to that, and I point out that in almost

every branch of the government and in every part, as a matter

of fact, every segment of our society, there are some who deviate
from the normal course. I feel that within the Bureau there is
less likelihood of this to happen, and I think that working
with you we can at least make some achievements that will be
significant. I

Now, whether it be lasting, I don't think so, but I
think we've made a good start. ,

Senator Mondale. In your speech in Montreal on August
9th, you said we must be willing to surrender a small measure
of our liberties to preserve the great bulk of them.

Which liberties did you have in mind?

Mr. Kelley. Well, of course, this speech has been mis-
understood many, many times.

Senator Mondale. Well, I want you to have a chance to
clear it up. polis anise itteett

Mr. Kelley. All that was intended here was a restatement
of the approach which the courts historically have used in
resolving most issues of Constitutional importance, and its

recognition that rights are not susceptible to absolute

protection. It's a matter of balance. Even in the Fourth
Amendment, for example, which protects the right of privacy, it

does not prohibit searches and seizures. I mention, it only

| refers to those that are unreasonable.

I came from the police fieid. What is more restrictive
to more people than traffic regulation? But what would be
more chaotic is of you did not have traffic regulation. We
do have to , in order to love in the complexities and
intricacies of today's life, have to give up some of our

rights.

Some may construe this as an extravagant statement. If jt |

has to be a balance.

have to give up some tights. Which rights would you have us
give up?

Mr. Kelly. Well, under the Fourth Amendment you would
have the right for search and seizure.

ment right.

Senator Mondale. There's no such right in the Consti-

under court warrant.

Did you mean to go beyond that?

Mr. Kelley. That's right.

Senator Mondale. That you should be able to go beyond
that?

Mr. Kelley. No, no. I do not mean that we should ever
go beyond a Constitutional right guarantee.

Senator Mondale. Well, would you say, Mr. Kelley, that

that sentence might have been inartful in your speech?

Mr. Kelley. I said that if it was misunderstood, I
made a mistake, because I should never make a statement which 4-
yes, it was inartful. :

Senator Mondale. I think I know about your record in
law enforcement well enough to tell you that I think you were
saying something different, that it was taken to mean something
different than I think you intended.

What you are saying is that in the exercise of your law
enforcement powers, the rights of individuals is determined
by the laws and the courts, but the courts, in the handling
of those issues, have to balance rights and other values.

That's what you're essentially saying, is that correct?

Senator Hart of Colorado. The Committee received a
letter from the Department of Justice a couple of days, the
Assistant Attorney General asking our cooperation in carrying
out the investigation or their efforts to review the investi-
gation conducted by the FBI into the death of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in order to determine whether that investigation
should be re-opened. They asked our cooperation, they asked
for our transcripts, the testimony before the Committee, all
material provided to the Committee by. the FBI which relates
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

I guess my question is this: Why is the Justice Depart-

ment asking this Committee for FBI files?

activities and reached the following conclusions, and I quote:

"The purpose of these counter-intelligence programs was
to prevent dangerously and potentially deadly acts against
individuals, organizations and institutions both public
and private across the United States."

Now we had an FBI informant in the other day before this
Committee and he stated he told the FBI on a number of
occasions he planned violent acts against black people in
groups. And yet, he said few, if any, anetances in which the
FBI actually prevented violence from taking place.

How does his testimony square with your statement that
I have quoted? :

Mr. Kelley. It doesn't, and I don't know if any of
his statements contrary to what we have said is the truth.

We don't subscribe to what he said. We have checked into it
and we know of no instances where, for example, 15 minutes
and that type of thing has been substantiated. :

Senator Hart of Colorado. You're saying the testimony
he gave us under oath was not accurate?

Now the Committee has received testimony that the New
Left COINTELPRO programs was not in fact told to higher
authorities, the Attorney Gereral and Congress.

Do you have any information in this regard?

I know in that statement you cite onw or two instances,
but in terms of the bulk of COINTEL programs, the record
seems to date at least to be clear that there was not vystenal
information flowing upward through the chain of command to
Director Hoover's superiors?

Mr. Kelley: May I ask that I be given the opportunity
to substantiate that with documentation?

Senator Hart of Colorado. Sure.

Mr.. Kelley; Or respond to it.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Dorector Kelley, just in
passing, do you agree with the statement made by President
Ford that those responsible for harassing and trying to destroy
Dr. King should be brought to justice.

Mr. Kelley. Those who directly responsible and upon whese orders
the activities were taken responsible. I don't know if he intended to say
that, but if he did not, I would say that it would be more proper. Insofar
as my own opinion is concerned, that it be centered on those who said
to do it and those who are responsible.

Mr, Kelley. Not quite.

Senator Hart of Colorado. That's all, Mr. Chairman,

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

Director Kelley, in the Committee's review of the
COINTELPRO program and other political involvements of the
FBI, it seems to me that we have encountered two or three
basic questions.

Since the investigation is over insofar as the Committee
is concerned, we're now turning our attention to remedies for
the future, what I would think would be our constructive
legislative work, it is very important that we focus on what
we learned in that investigation.

And one thing that we have learned is that Presidents of

the United States have from time to time ordered the FBI to

obtain for them certain kinds of information by exercising the
necessary surveillance to obtain .and to have a purely
political Eyer cters that they simply wanted to have for their
own personal purposes.

I think that you would agree that that is not a proper
function of the FBI, and you agree. :

Yet it's awfally difficult for anyone in the FBI,
including the Director, to turn down a President of the United
States if he receives a direct order from the President. It
is always possible, of course, to say no, and if you insist,

I will resign. But that puts a very hard burden on any man
serving in your position, particularly if the President puts
a good face on the request and makes it sound plausible or
even invents some excuse. It is always easy for him to say,
you know, I am considering Senator White for an important
position in my administration, and I need to know more about
his activities, particularly of late. I've had some cause
for concern and I want to be certain that there is nothing in
his record that would later embarrass me, and I just want you
to keep careful track of him and report to me on what he's
been doing lately.

It's difficult for you to say back to the President, Mr.
President, that's a very questionable activity for the FBI,
and I frankly don't believe that you've given me the real

reason why you want this man followed. I think his opposition

to your current policy is politically embarrassing to you and
you want to get something on him. .

I mean, ua know, the Director can hardly talk back that
way, and I'm wondering what we cquld do in the way of protecting
your office and the FBI from political exploitation in this
basic charter that we write. :

Now, I want your suggestions, but let's begin with one
or two of mine, I would like your response.

If we were to write into the law that any: order.given you
either by the President or by the Attorney General should be
transmitted in writing and should clearly state the objective
and purpose of the request and that the FBI would maintain
those written orders and that furthermore ‘they would be
available-to any oversight committee of the Congress. If the
joint committee on intelligence is established, that committee
would have access to such a file.

So that the committee itself would be satisfied that
orders were not being given to the FBI that were improper or
unlawful.

What would you think of writing a provision of that kind
into a charter for the FBI?

Hr, Kelley. I would say writing into the law any order
issued by, the President that is a request for action by the :
Attorney General should be in writing, is certainly, in my

opinion, is a very plausible solution. I'm sure that in

contemplation of this there would be some that will say yes
or some that will say no, but I think we could define an
area where you are trying to cure the abuses and we could
do that.

Now as to the availability to any oversight committee
of Congress, I would say generally that I certainly would have
no objection to this, but I again, there may be some request
for something of high confidentiality that the President might
put in writing such as some national or foreign security
matter.

I would like to have such a consideration be given a
great deal of thought and that the oversight committee review
be conditioned with that possibility. I don't think it would
present a problem.

I have said previously that I feel I can discuss every-
thing except the identity of the informants to the oversight
committee. I welcome that.

The Chairman. yell, that has been of course the way we
proceeded with this Committee. It has worked pretty well,

I think.

Now Senator Goldwater brought up a question on the
‘Martin Luther King tapes. I would like to pursue that question

If these tapes do not contain any evidence that needs
to be preserved for ongoing criminal investigations, and since

Dr. King has long since been violently removed from the scene,

to Federal positions. As a matter of fact, the only time I

| ever see an FBI agent is when he comes around and flashes his

badge and asks me a question or two about what I know of Mr.
so and so, who's being considered for an executive office.
And we have a very brief conversation in which I tell him that
as far as I know, he's a loyal and patriotic citizen, and that
is about the extent of it.

Then when this file is completed and the person involved
is either appointed or not appointed, what happens to that
file? I know it's full of all kinds of gossip because it is
in the nature of the investigation to go out to his old
neighborhoods and talk to everybody who might have known him.

What happens to the file? Is that just retained forever?

Mr. Kelley. We have some capability of destroying some
files and they are rather lengthy insofar as retention. We
have some archival rules which govern the retention of mateial
and is) developed in cases involving certain members of the
Executive Branch of the government.

I see no reason why this would not be a proper area
for consideration of legislation, ,

The Chairman. Can-you give me any idea of how much --
do you have records that would tell us how uch time and money
is being spent by the FBI just in conducting these thousands
of routine investigations on possible Presidential appointments

to Federal offices?

Mr. Kelley, I feel confident we can get it. I do not
have it now, but if you would like to have the annual cost
for the investigation of Federal appointees --

The Chairman. Yes. Plus, you know, plus any other
information that would indicate to us what proportion of the
time and effort of the FBI was absorbed in this kind of
activity.

Mr. Kelley. I can tell you it is relatively small, hut
“Z can get you, I think, the exact amount of time and the
approximate expense.

The Chairman. I wish you would do that because this is
a matter we need nipee information about. And when you supply
that data to the Committee, would you also supply the number
of such investigations each year?

You know, I don't expect you to go back 20 or 25 years,
but give us a good idea of the last few years. For example,
enough to give us an idea of how much time and how broad the
reach of these investigations may be.

Mr. Kelley. Through '70?

The Chairman, That would be sufficient, I would think.

“the other matter that is connected to this same subject
that I would like your best judgment on is whether these
investigations could not be limited to offices of sensitivity.

That is to say where legitimate national security interest might

be involved so that there is a reason to make a close check on

past associations, attitudes and expressions of belies.

I have often wondered whether we couldn't eliminate
routine Federal offices that are not particularly sensitive
in the national security sense from the reach of these FBI
checks.

And so when you respond to the series of questions, I
wish you would include the offices that are now covered by
such checks and give us an idea of how far down into the
Federal bureaucracy this extends.

Could you do that?

Mr. Kellev. Yes, sir.

The Chairman. Fine.

Now there is a vote. The vote always comes just at
the wrong time, but Mr. Schwarz wants to ask you some additional]
questions for the record, and there may be other questions,
too that would be posed by the staff, after which I will ask
Mr. Schwarz to adjourn the hearings. It looks like we're going
to be tied up on the floor with votes.

But before I leave I want to thank you for your testimony,
lir. Kelley, and to express my appreciation to you for the
way you have cooperated with the Committee in the course of
its investigation during the past months,

Mr. Kelley. Thank you.

The Chairman. And I hope, as you do, that as a result

of the work of the Committee we can write a generic law for

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Kelley, I'll try to be very brief.

On page 5 of your statement iii

Mr. Kelley. What?

Mr. Schwarz. On page 5 of your statement, the third
full paragraph, you said the following, and I would like then
to question about what you said. "We must recognize that
situations have occurred in the past and will arise in the
future where the Government may well be expected to depart from
its traditional role, in the FBI's case, as an investigative
and intelligence-gathering agency, and take affirmative steps
which are needed to meet an imminent threat to human life or
property."

Now, by that you mean to take what kind of steps in what
kind of situation?

And can you give some concrete examples under your general
principles statement?

Mr. Kelley. I think that Mr. Adams addressed himself to
that the other day, where you have an extremist who is an
employee at the waterworks, and he makes a statement that he's
going to do something which is devastating to the city, and you
have no way to attack this under the ordinary procedures, and
so therefore you must take some steps to meet that imminent
threat to human life or property.

Mr. Schwarz. So let us take that case as a test of the

principle. You are saying the extremist has said he is going

NW 55240 nee eee Page 174



2511

5
N

to do something to the waterworks, poison it or something, and
he is on the way down there with the poison in his car.

Is that the presumption?

Mr. Kelley. We hadn't goné that far, but all right, you

5 can extent it.
6 Mr. Schwarz. All right, now, in that case you have the

7 traditional law enforcement tool, which is the power of arrest.

8 Mr. Kelley. Not under probable cause where he has not

9 gone down there. The hypothetical we gave was one where he had
10 not taken any overt acts in perpetration of this.

1: Mr. Schwarz. Well, if he hasn't taken any overt acts,

12 are you then in what you would call in imminent threat of

13 human life or property?

WARD & PAUL

14 Mr. Kelley. I think so.

ae Mr. Schwarz. How so? Unless he has taken an overt: act:
16 to buy the poison or to get in the car with the poison, there
17 || is not by definition any threat to life or property.

1a | Mr. Kelley. Mr. Schwarz, I've-been around in this business.
19 a long time. I've-heard a number of threats which were issued,

21 || take these threats as being empty ones, because so many times

22 they have been acted upon.
23, I was criticized one time when there was a threat made to

24 kill me, and it was said later on, it's not rhetoric, it's

kill me, that just means one thing.
Mr. Schwarz. But I'm not disagreeing with you.
Mr. Kelley. But’ you are disagreéing with me. You're sayin

on the basis of experience that you cannot detect a possible

threat. That's the whole area of concern that we have here, where |

we don't lose the capability of doing something. We don't
say we should initiate ourselves. We say that we should go to
the Attorney General. We do not subscribe to the idea that
we should act independently because maybe we don't have the
judicial review, the capability of determining, but we do
think that we should report it and thereafter see what can
be done.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, have you changed in the course of
our discussion the standard on page 5.

On page 5 you're talking about an imminent threat..

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And I hear you now as saying a possible
threat.

Mr. Kelley. An imminent possible threat.

Mr. Schwarz. An imminent possible threat. All right.

Now, would a fair standard for either action, other than
arrest, I don't know what you have in mind, but something to
prevent the person from carrying out his activities, other
than arrest, for instance, what is an example of what you have

in mind?

Mr. Kelley. Removing him from his position or whatever
is necessary ‘in order to make it impossible or at least as
impossible as possible to perpetuate this thing.

Mr. Schwarz. You mean have him lose his job or --

Mr. Kelley. I don't know what it would be.

Mr. Schwarz. Isolate him in some fashion.

Mr. Kelley. In some fashion perhaps.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, for such activity and for opening
an investigation into ad domestic group, could you live with
a standard which said you would have to have an immediate
threat that someone was likely to commit a serious federal
crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. I think that this thing could be worked out
so that there could be an adequate basis for an evaluation.

Mr. Schwarz. So those words, without trying to commit
you entirely to them, do not seem to you to depart far from
what you think would be an acceptable standard.

Mr. Kelley. Well, an imminent, immediate threat might
be, by virtue of the word “immediate” that he's going to
do it the next minute. In that case it may be necessary for
you to, not with the presence or the possibility, not able
to do anything except put him under arrest or anything.

Mr. Schwarz. Of course, of course.

And nobody would at all disagree with that kind of action.

Mr. Kelley. I don't think they would either.

Mr. Schwarz. But on the question, let's take the opening
of an investigation into a domestic group.

Is it basically consistent with practicality to make the
test immediate threat of a serious Federal crime involving
violence?

Mr.Kelley. To open a domestic security case.

Mr. Schwarz. Yes.

Mr. Kelley. It appears to me that this is a terrorist
activity, in effect. We certainly have terrorist activities
under our jurisdiction as a threat against the United States.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, are there other circumstances where
it is justifiable to open an investigation of the domestic
group where you do not have an immediate threat of serious
federal crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. Oh, I think there are other criteria, and
they have been well defined as to what is the possible
opening, the basis for a possible opening. We haven't been
discussing that, we have been discussing particular instances,
but there are other criteria that are used, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. What would the other criteria be?

Mr. Kelley. Well, the possible statutory violations
over which we have jurisdiction are, generally speaking, the
most used of thebasis, and then you have, of course, some
intelligence investigations which should, of course, be of

short duration. If there is no showing of this into action

or a viable intent.

Mr. Schwarz. So that's what you're looking for in the
intelligence investigation?

Mr. Kelley. . By intelligence investigation, yes, you
are looking to prevent.

Mr. Schwarz. And what you are looking jg ers , and
what you're looking to find is a likelihood of action combined
with an intent to take an issue?

Mr. Kelley. And the capability.

Mr. Schwarz. And the capability.

All right. I just have two other lines, Mr. Kelley, and
I appreciate very much your time.

Mr. Kelley. That's all right.

Mr. Schwarz. Assuming a legitimate investigation has -
been started into a domestic intelligence matter, is it legiti-
mate for the FBI, in addition to obtaining information that
relates to what we've just been talking about, the likelihood
of violent action, is it also legitimate for the FBI to
collect, A, retain, B, disseminate, C, information concerning
let's say the sex life of a person on the one hand, and the
political views of a person on the other?

Mr. Kelley. I think, Mr. Schwarz, that this is just what
many of our problems and perhaps the guidelines can define
this type of thing. I think probably you will agree that

within the determination of the deviations possibly of sex

lives, there might be something that is relevant. I would ‘say
ordinarily it's not. And so far as political ciewat yes, I
think that this could be, if he is espousing some cause or
some view that advocates violence or the overthrow of the
government.

Mr. Schwarz. Would those be the two limits on political
views?

Mr. Kelley. What?

Mr. Schwarz. Would those be the only limits on political
views that you think are okay to collect, advocants of violence
or advocants of overthrow?

Mr. Kelley. Well, I don't think because he's a Democrat
or a Republican it would be anything that would be damaging,
but it might on the other hand counter the report that he's
a member of some other organization.

Mr. Schwarz. Is the standard you used on collection of
sex life information, might be relevant? I suppose anything
might be relevant, but don't you think that as a function of
balance, it has to have a high degree of relevance before it's
justifiable to collect that kind of information on American
citizens who are not suspected of having committed crimes?

Mr. Kelley. Insofar as doing it presently, it has been
included in some reports as a result of the requirement that
that is what is required by our rules, that when a person

reports something to us, we do a report of the complaint. Tasos

as a determination by guidelines that might be prepared later,
I think that we can certainly deliberate on this to see whether
or not this is something we should retain, and we would not
object to anything reasonable in that regard.

Mr. Schwarz. I just have one final question.

Taking the current manual and trying to understand its
applicability laid against the facts in the Martin Luther King
case, under Section 87 there is a -- permission is granted to
open investigations of the infiltration of non-subversive
groups, and the first sentence reads: "When information is
received indicating that a Penman group is seeking to
systematically infiltrate and control a non-subversive group
or organization, an investigation can be opened."

Now,.I take it that is the same standard that was used
in opening the investigation of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in the 1960s, so that invéstigation could still be
open today under the FBI manual, the current FBI manual.

Mr. Kelley. We are interested in the infiltration of
clearly subversive groups into non-subversive groups inasmuch
as this isa ploy that is used many times, and having infil-
trated, they then get control, and they have a self-laundered
organization which they can use, and not, certainly, to the
benefit of the country.

Mr. Schwarz. But is the answer to my question yes, that

under that standard, the SCLC investigation could still be

opened today?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Schwarz. All right, then, just one final question.

Do you agree that special care needs to be taken not only
of the standards for initially opening an investigation of a
group, but perhaps extra care needs to be taken when the investil-
gation goes beyond the initial target group to individuals
or people who come into contact with it?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know if I agree with that entirely. If
you mean that we go into the non-subversive group, that we
then investigate peopie in that non-subversive group, not the
infiltrators, but the non, that ie conduct a lengthy investigatilon
of them without any basis for doing so other than that they
are in an infiltrated group, I would likely have said -- but
off the top of my head I would say probably that's not necessary.

Mr. Schwarz. Thank you very much.

Mr. Smothers. Just a couple of very brief lines of
inquiry, Mr. Kelley.

I think that the questions of the Chief Counsel. was
raising is one that goes further into your statement, when you

Putting aside for one moment the counterespionage
effort, and looking strictly at what we have ‘been calling the
Domestic Intelligence, is it your view that the retention of
this function in the Bureau is critical to the Bureau's
law enforcement position?

Mr. Kelley. My personal opinion is that ‘the Bureau does
a splendid job in this area. I feel further that the Paeeceoaes
of criminal investigatory activities and experiences which
all counterintelligence people have is very helpful. It is hely
ful not only in gathering knowledge and experience, it also
enters into this field, a person with a broad understanding
of the rights and privileges, and you don't have so much that
spy type, that cloak and dagger, that very, very secret type
of an operation.

I subscribe to the present system heartily.

Mr. Smothers. Would it be of assistance to your mission
if within the Bureau guidelines were established that
effectively limited access or controlled dissemination of
the intelligence product? In other words, if we had a
situation where the intelligence product is critical to assist
the law enforcement effort, I don't think there's any question
that there should be access to it.

Isn't our problem one of controlling the use of that
intelligence product and preventing the kind of murky crossing

of lines there with the information legitimately needed for

Mr. Kelley. There is always a problem when there is wide
dissemination, because that just numerically increases the
possibility of misuse, abuse or slander, ‘libel, or anything
of that matter, and I think that it would be well worthwhile
to review the dissemination rules to make them subject to
¢lose guidance in the guidelines that we're speaking of.

Mr. Smothers. Let me just raise one final area with you.

We talked a little bit about, or a question was raised about
the investigation now being conducted by the Justice Department
regarding the improper actions on the COINTELPRO, and the
King case in particular.

I think it would be helpful for our record here to have some
insight into the procedure the Bureau would normally follow.

What does the Bureau do when you get an allegation that
an agent or administrative official in the Bureau has behaved
improperly?

Is an investigation conducted internally, or is it
routinely referred to the Justice Department?

Mr. Kelley. There may be a revision in this type of
procedure as a result of the establishment of the Council for
Professional Responsibility. At present it would be in the
great majority of the cases turned over to our Investigative

Division for investigation. There might, on some unusual

occasion, be a designation of a special task force made up,
perhaps, of division heads. That is most Ea ieay | but it is
handled internally at present.

Mr. Smothers. Would these internal determinations be
reviewed by Justice, or do you think that is a necessary
step?

I guess what we are searching for here is, first of all,
I think you answered that, well, to what extent does the
Bureau police itself, and then secondly, is the Department of
Justice involved in the police determinations?

For instance, what if the Attorney General disagreed with
the assertion that only the higher up officials who ordered
the action against King should be the subject of investigation
and maybe prosecution?

How does the interplay work there between you and Justice?

Mr. Kelley. We do report to the Attorney General those

activities which we construe as improper or possibly. illegal.
There is a possibility that the Department, having been advised
‘of the situation, might take it on their own to do their own
investigating, and this is something that we feel is a
decision to be made only rather rarely, because we feel we
have within our own organization sufficient capability to
handle that. But we do not protest it. It is handled
independently of us.

Mr. Smothers. Thank you.

FBI's “POLITICAL ABUSES”
Full Text of Official Report

‘|NW 55240 Docld:32989817

New light now is shed on a mystery that has fasci-
nated, and worried, official Washington for years: To
what extent has the Federal Bureau of Investigation
been used as a kind of “secret police” to spy on
political figures and events—and who used it that
way?

The answers, according ‘to a report by the staff of
the Senate Intelligence Committee, are that the FBI
was indeed subject to “political abuse,” and that it
happened under every President from Franklin D.
Roosevelt to Richard Nixon. -

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is
headed by Senator Frank Church (Dem.), of Idaho. It
has been investigating both the FBI and the Central
Intelligence Agency: for months, with the aim of de-
veloping closer supervision of intelligence agencies in
the future.

On these pages you get the complete text of the
Committee staffs report on the FBI and its contro-
versial role in recent American history.

The political abuse of the FBI did not begin in the 1960s.
Although this Committee has concentrated its investigations
on the events ofthe ’60s and 70s, the story cannot be fully
understood by looking at just the last 15 years.

Therefore, the first objective of this report is to lay out
some of the historical context for more-recent political
abuses of the Bureau.

The second objective is to describe some of the results of ,
our investigation which show the
various types of political abuse to ”
which the FBI is susceptible.

Some have been in response to the
desires of the Bureau's superiors.

Others have been generated by
thé Edireau itself.

question for the Committee to answer when all. the evi-
dehee is in. as

Historical Background

The historical background of political abuse of the FBI
inyolves at least three dimensions.

“The first is the’Bareau’s subservience ‘to the-Presidency,
its willingness to carry out White Hoyse requests without
question. When L. Patrick Gray, as acting FBI Director,
destroyed documents and gave FBI reports to presidential
aides whom the FBI should have been investigating after
the Watergate break-in, he just carried to the extreme an
established practice of service to the White House.

The other side of this practice was the Bureau’s volun-
teering political intelligence to its superiors, not in response
to any specific request.

And the third historical dimension was the FBI's concert-
-ed effort to promote its public image and discredit its
critics.

Early examples of the Bureau’s willingness to do the
President’s bidding occur under Franklin D. Roosevelt. I
1940 it complied with a request to run name checks, open
files, and make reports on hundreds of persons who sent
telegrams to the President that were—to quote the letter
frota the President’s secretary to J. Edgar Hoover—“all
more or less in opposition to national defense,” or that

“expressed approval of Col. Charles Lindbergh’s criticism of
the President, : PesSBTEEREEEEy

Another example came to light in recent years when Maj.
Gen. Harry Vaughan, who was President Truman’s military
aide, disclosed that President Roosevelt had ordered wire-

+ taps on the home telephones of his

eoseneanan closest aides. Shortly after Mr. Tru-

man had taken office, someone had

£4 presented General Vaughan with

at transctipts of the wiretaps. He took

them to President Truman, who said,

according to General Vaughan: “I

don’t have time for that foolishness.”

This story is generally confirmed by

the Committee staff's inquiry into J.

Edgar Hoover’s “Official and Confi-

dential Files,” where an index to the
logs of these wiretaps was located.

Historical illustrations of the FBI's
wractice of volunteering political in-

“telliénce to its superiors appear in
virtually every Administration.

President Roosevelt’s Attorney
General, Francis Biddle, recalled in
his autobiography how J. Edgar Hoo-
ver shared with him some of the
“intimate details” of what his fellow
Cabinet members did and said—
“their likes and sislikes, their weak-
nesses and their associations.” Attor-
ney General Biddle confessed ‘het

he enjoyed hearing these derogatory and sometimes “em-
, _ barrassing” stories and that-Director Hoover “knew how to
flatter his superior.” : 7

President Truman and his aides received regular letters
from Hoover labeled “Personal and Confidential” and con-
taining tidbits of political intelligence. Sometimes they re-
ported on possible Communist influence behind various
lobbying efforts, such as activities in support of civil-rights
legislation. On other occasions they reported allegations
that a Communist sympathizer had helped write a Senator’s
speech, and inside information about the negotiating posi-
tion of a non-Communist labor union.

Some of the letters were undoubtedly of political value to
-the-Presilent..One.related the activities-of.a former Rocse-
velt aide who was trying to influence the Truman Adminis-
tration’s appointments. Another advised that the FBI had
learned from. a confidential source that a “scandal” was
brewing and that it would be “very embarrassing to the
Democratic Administration.” A third contained the report
of a “very confidential source” about a meeting of newspa-
per representatives in Chicago to plan publication of a
series of stories exposing organized crime and corrupt politi-
cians. The stories were going to be critical of the Attorney
General and the President.

The Truman White House also received a copy of an FBI
memorandum reporting the contents of an in-house com-
munication from Newsweek magazine reporters to their
editors about a story they had obtained from the State
Department.

An example from the Eisenhower Administration shows

‘how White House requests and’ FBI initiative were some-
times mixed together. President Eisenhower asked Director
Hoover to brief the Cabinet on racial tensions in early 1956.
What the Cabinet received was a report not only on inci-
dents of violence, but, also on the activities of Southern
Governors and Congressmen in groups opposing integra-
tion, as well as the role of Communists in civil-rights lobby-
ing efforts and the NAACP’s plans to push for legislation.

No one appears to have questioned the propriety of the
FBI reporting such political intelligence, or Director Hoo-
ver’s competence to do so,

* The third source of abuse throughout the Bureau’s history
was its concern for its image and hostility to any critics. One
example each from the Truman and Eisenhower years
shows how the Bureau checked and reported on its critics.

In 1949 the National Lawyers Guild planned to issue a
report denouncing FBI surveillance activities revealed in a
court case. The FBI provided the Attorney General advance
information from its sources about the Lawyers Guild plans,
as well as a full report on everything about the group in
Bureau files. Attorney General Howard McGrath passed the
reports on to thé President, and J. Edgar Hoover advised
the White House directly about last-minute changes in. the
Guild’s plans. The FBI's inside information gave the Attor-
ney General the opportunity to prepare a rebuttal well in
advance of the expected criticism.

The secend instance took place in 1960, when the Ten-
nessee Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Com-
mission announced it would investigate charges by the
Knoxville Area Human Relations Council that federal agen-
cies, including the FBI, were practicing racial discrimina-
tion. The FBI conducted name checks on the 11 members
of the counceil’s board of directors. The results were sent to
Attorney General Willian} Rogéts, Deputy Attorney Gener-
al Lawrence Walsh, and Special Assistant to the Attorney
General Harold R. Tyler, Jr.

Derogatory information on four of these individuals in.
cluded allegations of subversive connections from as far
back as the late ’30s and early ’40s, an allegation that one
board member had “corrupt political associates” in 1946.
and the characterization of another as having “unorthodo:
attitudes” and sending flowers and “mash” notes to a wom.
an in his church. The FBI’s report also made the flat
statement: “As you know, this Bureau does not practice |
racial segregation or discrimination.” (The Committee will -}
recall that it has previously received information as to the
number of black FBI agents in the early 1960s.)

‘Thus, the Bureau’s more distent history shows the devei- +
opment of its political services for higher authorities and its *
concern for its own political position.

Name-Check Abuses

The staff's investigation of alleged abuses in the 1960s and “
70s discloses a wide variety of questionable name checks #
sometimes for Presidents and sometimes in the Bureau's
own interest.

An examination of these name-check reports shows the
peculiarly damaging nature of the Bureau’s practice. No
new investigation was done to verify the allegations stored
away for years in FBI files. Anything anyone ever told the 4
FBI about the individual was pulled together, includinz 4
charges that the Bureau may never have substantiated. FBI
files inevitably include misinformation because people bear }
grudges or make mistakes. Sometimes the Bureau verifies
the charge, but frequently there is no reason to do so, and it
js just recorded in the files. Such charges can be: retrieved
by a name check and reported without further sub-
stantiation.

‘The request by the Nixon White House for a name che:k
‘on CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr, which the FBI turned
into a full field investigation, has been examined extensively 3
elsewhere. The staff has determined that President Johnse
asked for name-check reports on at least seven other jot.r-
nalists, including NBC commentator David Brinkley, Asse- 4
ciated Press reporter Peter Arnett and columnist Josep!
Kraft.

Another political abuse of FBI name checks occurred in
the closing days of the 1964 presidential-election campaig'
when Johnson aide Bill Moyers asked the Bureau to repot? #
on all persons employed in Senator Goldwater's oftie #
Moyers has publicly recounted his rele in the incident, and 3
his account is confirmed by FBI documents.

Some of President Johnson’s requests parallel those «!

with White House requests for name checks on dozens of

| persons who signed telegrams critical of U.S. Vietnam policy

|; in 1965. The names of other presidential critics were also

| sent to the Bureau to be checked and reported on, as were

the names of critics of the Warren Commission. The FBI
also volunteered reports on presidential critics.

The White House requests for name checks are episodic
in comparison to the name checks conducted as a matter of
systematic Bureau policy for the use of FBI Director Hoo-
ver. The Crime Records Division prepared_name-check
memoranda for Director Hoover regularlyon Congressmen,
other .public officials, and prominent persons of interest to
the Director. Many of these special memoranda were filed
by the Crime Records Division. Others foumd their way into
Director Hoover's “Official and Confidential Files.”

The Committee staff has located in these “O and C Files”
such special memoranda on the author of a critical book
about the FBI, and on all the members of the Senate
subcommittee chaired by Senator Long which threatened to
investigate the FBI in the mid-1960s. Some of these name-
check reports and special memoranda contained derogatory

‘information and, in the case of the author, information from
his income-tax returns and personal information about his
wife. The reports on members of the Long committee were
compiled in a briefing book, with tabs on each Senator.

Therefore, these incidents demonstrate the potential for
abuse inherent in the Bureau’s unregulated name-check
procedure. White House requests bypassed the Attorney
General, and the FBI Director’s own requests took place
totally within the Bureau. The real meaning of the long-
standing fear that the FBI had so-called dossiers on Con-
gressmen and other prominent persons was that FBI offi-
cials could have name-check reports prepared for his use on
anyone he desired to know more about.

| President Roosevelt 25 years earlier. The FBI complied

Abuse of FBI Investigative Powers

The next category is abuse of the FBI's investigative
powers.

There is a vivid example under the Kennedy Adminis-
-cation involving the FBI's late-night and early-morning
interviews of a steel-company exccutive and several report-
ers who had written stories about the steel executive. For-
mer Assistant FBI Director Courtney Evans, who was infor-
mal liaison with Attorney General Kenredy, has told the
Committee that he was given no reason fer the request.

Another example arises out of the Bolsby Baker case. In

U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, Dec. 15, 1975

Richard M. Nixon

Lyndon B. Johnson

1965 the FBI declined a request of the Justice Department
Criminal Division to “wire” a witness in the investigation of
former Johnson Senate aide Bobby Baker. Although the FBI
refused on grounds that there was not adequate security,
the Criminal Division had the Bureau of Narcotics in the
‘Treasury Department “wire” the witness as a legitimate
alternative. When the Baker trial began in 1967, this be-
came known. Presidential aide Marvin Watson told the FBI
that President Johnson was quite “exercised,” and the FBI
was ordered to conduct a discreet “rundown” on the head
of the Criminal Division in 1965 and four persons in Trea-
sury and the Narcotics Bureau, including specifically any
associations with former Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

Another incident occurred in 1966 when Mr. Watson
requested that the FBI monitor the televised hearings of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Vietnam and
prepare a memorandum comparing siatements of Senators
Fulbright and Morse with “the Communist Party line.”

At the request of President Johnson, made directly to FBI
executive Cartha DeLoach, the FBI passed purely political
intelligence about United States Senators to the White
House which was obtained as a by-product of otherwise
legitimate national-security electronic surveillance of
foreign-intelligence targets. This practice also continued
under the Nixon Administration at the request of Mr. H. R.
Haldeman.

It is more difficult to place the labei “abuse” autornatical-
ly on presidential requests for electronic surveillance to
investigate leaks of classified information. Attorney General
Kennedy authorized wiretaps in 1962 on New York Times
reporter Hanson Baldwin and his secretary, and they lasted
for about one month.

In addition to the wiretap on New York Times reporter
Hanson Baldwin in 1962, the Committee has received mate-
rials from the FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney
General Robert Kennedy of a wiretap ou a reporter for
Newsweek magazine in 1961 during the investigation of
another leak of classified inforination. Further materials
reflect authorization by Attorney General Nicholas Katzen-
bach of a wiretap on the editor of an anti-Communist
newsletter in 1965, also during the investigation of a leak of
classified information.

The Committee has received materials from the FBI
reflecting authorization by Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy of wiretaps on at least six American citizens,
including three executive-branch officials, a congressional
staff member and two registered lobbying agents for foreign
interests. The materials also reflect that these wiretaps

A [text continued fromMmeceding page)

related to an investigation of efforts by foreign interests to
sinfluence United States economic policies.

The wiretaps under the Nixon Administration of journal-
ists and current or former White House and other executive
officials have been widely publicized.

The staff's iziquiry into this matter has determined that,
according to available records, at jeast one of these wiretaps
had nothing to do with leaks and was conducted solely for
personal information about the target. Nevertheless, the
wiretapping to investigate leaks under Attorneys General
Kennedy and Katzenbach and of President Roosevelt's aides
were undoubtedly precedents J. Edgar Hoover had in mind
when he told President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger in 1969
that wiretaps had been used for these purposes in the past.

Another abuse of EBL investigative .powers.nador the.
Johnson Administration was the surveillance conducted at
the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City.
The most-sensitive details of the plans and tactics of persons
supporting the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party dele-
gate challenge went to the White House from the FBI's
wiretap on Dr. [Martin Luther] King and other types of FBI
surveillance. The responsible White House official at the
time, Mr. Walter Jenkins, has told the Committee that he
can recall no political use made of these reports. Neverthe-
less, an unsigned document has been located at the Johnson
Library recording at least one political use of Mr. DeLoach’s
phone reports,

As Theodore H. White's account of the 1964 campaign
{The Making of the President 1964”} makes clear, the most
important single issue that might have disturbed President
Johnson at the Atlantic City Convention was the Mississippi
challenge.-And the FBI’s-own inquiry into the Atlaiitic"City
events reports several FBI agents’ recollection that one
purpose of the Bureau operation was to help avoid “embar-
rassment to the President.”

+ The Committee must weigh all the evidence in deciding
whether this abuse of the FBI resulted from a White House
request, from FBI officials volunteering information to
serve and please the President, or from a legitimate civil-
disorders intelligence operation which got out of hand be-
cause no one was willing to shut off the political-intelligence
by-product.

Tt should also be noted that an aide to Vice President
Hubert Humphrey contacted the FBI to request assistance
at the 1968 Chicago [Democratic] Convention. Nothing
appears to have come of this request, largely because Attor-
ney General Ramsey Clark turned down FBI requests for
authorization to wiretap protest-demonstration leaders at
the Chicago Convention. 7

According to. materials provided to the Committee by the
FBI, President Johnson asked the FBI to conduct physical
surveillance on Mrs. Anna Chennault, prominent Republi-
can woman leader, on Oct. 30, 1968, in the final days of the
election campaign. The FBI instituted this surveillance to

: cover ker activities in Washington, D.C, and New York

|_| City. The results of this physical surveillance were dissemi-

nated to J. Bromley Smith, executive secretary of the Na-
tional Security Council, who had conveyed Johnson’s re-

quest to Cartha DeLoach of the FBI. On Nov. 7, 1968,

Smith called DeLoach and stated that President Johnson

wanted the FBI to abandon its physical surveillance of Mrs.

Chennault.

On Nov.e13, 1968, at the instryction of President Johnson,
the FBI checked the toll call telephone records in Albu-
querque, N.M., to determine if vice-presidential candidate
Spiro Agnew had called Mrs. Chennault or the South Viet-

namese Embassy om Nov. 2, 1968, when he was in Albu- |
querque. No such necords were located. President Johnsun 4
was furnished with: this information on Nov. 13, 19€8. Also,
the arrival and departure times of Agnew in and out of |
Albuquerque on Nav. 2, 1968, were verified at the request ]
of the White House. §

The FBI has reviiewed its files on this matter and has |
advised that the ajpparent reason the White House wis
interested in the activities of Mrs. Chennault and Spi:
Agnew was to determine whether the South Vietnamese
had secretly been in touch with supporters of presidemiai
candidate Nixon, passibly through Mrs. Chennault, as Presi-
dent Johnson was apparently suspicious that the South Viet-
namese were trying to sabotage his peace negotiations in |
the hope that Nixom would win the election and then take a |
harder line towards. ‘North Vietnam.

The FBI also states that physical surveillance of Mrs. 4
Chennault was consistent with FBI responsibilities to deter-
mine if her activities were in viclation of certain provisions
of the Foreign Agerts Registration Act (Section. 601, et seq.. 4
Title 22, USC) and of the Neutrality Act (Section 953, Title |
18, USC).

(Further details of these events involving electronic sur-
veillance remain classified “Top Secret.”)

“Finally, there are two additional examples of political
abuse of the FBI or lay the FBI in the 1970s. q

In July, 1971, three months after the supposed end of FB!
COINTELPRO [counterintelligence program] operations.
the FBI leaked to. a newsman derogatory public-record 4
information about Beanie] Ellsberg’s lawyer. Copies of the }
article were sent to the Attorney General, the Deputy 4
Attorney General and presidential aide H. R. Haldeman.
with the specific approval of Director Hoover, with ne 4
indication it was generated by the FBI. i

In May, 1970, the FBI provided Vice President Agnew at 4
his request with derogatory public-record information and
other allegations about Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, thy
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 4
‘This occurred following a telephone conversation between 4
Director Hoover and Mr. Agnew during which, according to
FBI records, the Vice President “said he thought he wa: 4
going to have to start destroying Abernathy’s credibility.”

Thus, in summary, political abuse of the FBI and by thr
FBI has extended over the years through Administrations uf
both parties.

PERTAINING TO THE KU KLUX KLAN,

GARY ROWE, FORMER FBI INFORMANT, AND

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS OF THE FBI

TO PREVENT VIOLENCE

DECEMPER 2, 1975

NW 55240 DocId:32989817 Page i197



QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

+...You do use informants and do instruct them to
spread dissention among certain groups that they are
informing on, do you not?

We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were
discontinued in 1971, and IT think the Klan is probably one
of the best examples of a situation where the law was
ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights
used much more than we hear today. We saw with the
Little Rock situation the President of the United States
sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use
local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement
use the troops only as a last resort. When you have a
situation like this where you do try to preserve the
respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical
problems.

With the Klan coming along, we had situations where
the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless
to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some
areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents
mentioned by Mr. Rowe--everyone of those he saw them from the
lowest level--the informant. He didn't see what action
was taken with that information as he pointed out during

his testimony. Our files show that this information was

reported to the police departments in every instance.

o know that in certain instances the infor-
mation upon being recei ot being acted upon. We

also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

memorandum to the Department of Justice the problem.

And here we were--the FBI~-in a position where we had no
authority in the absence of an instruction from the
Department of Justice to make an arrest. Section 241

and 242 don't cover it because you don't have evidence

of a conspiracy. It ultimately resulted in a situation
where the Department called in U. S. Marshals who do have
authority similar to local law enforcement officials.

So historically, in those days, we were just as
frustrated as anyone else was, that when we got information
from someone like Mr. Rowe--good information, reliable
information-~and it was passed on to those who had the
responsibility to do something about it, it was not always
acted upon as he indicated.

In none of these cases, then, there was adequate
evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to act.

The Departmental rules at that time, and still do,
require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.
Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together.
You can have a mob scene and you can have blacks and whites
belting each other, but unless you can show that those that
initiated the action acted in concert, in a conspiracy, you
have no violation.

Congress recognized this and it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the Civil

Rights Statute which added punitive measures against an

individual. There didn't have to be a conspiracy. This
was a problem that the whole country was grappling with--
the President of the United States, Attorneys General--we
were in a situation where we had rank lawlessness taking
place. As you know from the memorandum we sent you that
we sent to the Attorney General the accomplishments we were
able to obtain in preventing violence and in neutralizing
the Klan and that was one of the reasons.

....A local town meeting on a controversial social
issue might result in disruption. It might be by hecklers
rather than by those holding the meeting. Does this
mean that the Bureau should investigate all groups
organizing or participating in such meetings because
they may result in violent government disruption?

No six, and we don't....

Isn't that how you justify spying on almost every
aspect of the peace movement?

No sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we monitor

demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have
an investigative interest in, a valid investigative
interest in, or where members of one of these groups are
participating where there is a potential that they might
change the peaceful nature of the demonstration.

This is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing

on the lst Amendment right, yet at the same time, being

-3-

DocId:32989817 Page 200



e e

aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers
in the past than we do at the present time. We have had
periods where the demonstrations have been rather severe
and the courts have said that the FBI has the right,
and indeed the duty, to keep itself informed with respect
to the possible commission of crime. It is not obliged
to wear blinders until it may be too late for prevention.
Now that's a good statement if applied in a clear-cut
case.

Our problem is where we have a demonstration and
we have to make a judgment call as to whether it is one
that clearly fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor
the activities. That's where I think most of our disagree-
ments fall.

QUESTION: In the Rowe Case, in the Rowe testimony that we just
heard, what was the rationale again for not intervening when
violence was known about. I know we have asked this several
times--I'm still having trouble understanding what the
rationale, Mr. Wannall, was in not intervening in the Rowe
situation when violence was known.

MR. WANNALL: Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address himself to

that and if you have no objections, I'll ask that he be
the one to answer the question.

MR. ADAMS: The problem we had at the time, and it is the problem
today, we are an investigative agency; we do not have

police powers even like the U. S. Marshals do. The Marshals

NW 55240 DocId:32989817 Page 201

[



since about 1795 I guess, or some period like that, had
authorities that almost border on what a sheriff has. We
are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice,
and during these times the Department of Justice had us
maintain the role of an investigative agency.

We were to report on activities. We furnished the
information to the local police who had an obligation to
act. We furnished it to the Department of Justice in those
areas where the local police did not act. It resulted
finally in the Attorney General sending 500 U. S. Marshals
down to guarantee the safety of people who were trying to
march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at
a time of Civil Rights versus Federal Rights and yet there
was a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the
country. This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement
agencies in the South at the time either, because many of
them did act upon the information that was furnished to
them. But we have no authority to make an arrest on the
Spot because we would not have had evidence that was a
conspiracy available. We could do absolutely nothing in
that regard. In Little Rock the decision was made, for
instance, that if any arrests need to be made, the Army
should make them. And next to the Army, the U. S. Marshals
should make them--not the FBI, even though we developed

the violations. We have over the years as you know at the

MR. ADAMS:

MR ADAMS:

Time there were many questions raised. Why doesn't the
FBI stop this? Why don't you do something about it? Well,
we took the other route and effectively destroyed the Klan
as far as committing acts of violence and, of course, we
exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

What would be wrong, just following up on your point
there, Mr. Adams, with setting up a program since it is
obvious to me that a lot of our informers are going to
have preknowledge of violence of using U. S. Marshals on
some kind of long-range basis to prevent violence?

We do. We have them in Boston in connection with
the busing incident. We are investigating the violations
under the Civil Rights Act, but the Marshals are in
Boston. They are in Louisville, I believe, at the same
time and this is the approach that the Federal Government
finally recognized.

On an immediate and fairly contemporary basis that
kind of help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting
till it gets to a Boston state. I realize a departure from
the past and not saying it isn't, but it seems to me we need
a better remedy than we have.

Well, fortunately we are at a time where conditions have
subsided in the country even from the 60's and the 70's, or
50's and 60's. We report to the Department of Justice on
potential trouble spots around the country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be aware of them. The planning

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

for Boston, for instance, took’ place a year in advance, with
state officials, city officials, the Department of Justice

and the FBI sitting down together saying "How are we going to
protect the situation in Boston"? I think we have learned a
lot from the days back in the early 60's. But, the Government
had no mechanics which protected people at that time.

Next I would like to ask, back in 1965, I guess during
the height of the effort to destroy the Klans as you put it
a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released figures that
we had something like 2,000 informers of some kind or another
infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10,000 estimated member-
ship.

That's right.

I believe these are FBI figures or estimates. ‘ That would
mean that 1 out of every 5 members of the Klan at that point
was'an informant paid by the Government and I believe the
figure goes on to indicate that 70 percent of the new members
in the Klan that year were FBI informants. Isn't that an
awful overwhelming quantity of people to put in an effort such
as that? I'm not criticizing that we shouldn't have informants
in the Klan and know what is going on to revert violence but it
just seems to me that the tail is sort of wagging the dog. For
example today we supposedly have only 1594 total informants,
both domestic informants and potential informants. Yet, here
we have 2,000 in just the Klan alone.

Well, this number of 2,000 did include all racial matters

and informants at that particular time and I think the figures



we tried to reconstruct as to the actual number of Klan
informants in relaton to Klan members was around 6 percent, I
think after we had read some of the testimony on it. Isn't that
right, Bill? Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan
had a group called the Action Group. This was the group if you
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony that he was left out of in
the beginning. He attended the open meetings and heard all the
hoorahs and this type of information but he never knew what was
going on because each one had an Action Group that went out and
considered themselves in the missionary field. Theirs was the
violence. In order to penetrate those you have to direct as
many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in mind
that I think the newspapers, the President, Congress, everyone,
was concerned about the murder of the three civil rights
workers, the Lemul Penn case, the Violet Liuzzo case, the
bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one
tremendous problem at that time.

QUESTION: I acknowledge that.

MR. ADAMS: Our only approach was through informants. Through the
use of informants we solved these cases. The ones that were
solved. There were some of the bombing cases we never solved.
They're extremely difficult, but, these informants as we told
the Attorney General and as we told the President, we moved
informants like Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the
bodyguard to the head man. He was in a position where he

could see that this could continue forever unless we could

NW 55240 DocId:32989817 Page 205 —8-



create enough disruption that these members will realize that
if I go out and murder three civil rights, even though the
Sheriff and other law enforcement officers are in on it, if
that were the case, and in some of that was the case, that I
will be caught, and that's what we did, and that's why violence
stopped because the Klan was insecure and just like you say

20 percent, they thought 50 percent of their members ultimately
were Klan members, and they didn't dare engage in these acts of
violence because they knew they couldn't control the conspiracy
any longer.

QUESTION: I just have one quick question. Is it correct that in
1971 we were using around 6500 informers for a black ghetto
situation?

MR ADAMS: I'm not sure if that's the year. We did have a year
where we had a number like that of around 6000 and that was
the time when the cities were being burned. Detroit, Washington,
areas like this, we were given a mandate to know what the

situation is, where is violence going to break out next. They

weren't informants like an individual that is penetrating an
organization. They were listening posts in the community that
would help tell us that we have another group here that is
getting ready to start another fire fight or something.
QUESTION: ++. Without going into that subject further of course we
have had considerable evidence this morning where no attempt
was made to prevent crime when you had information that it
was going to occur. I am sure there were instances where

you have,

We disseminated every single item which he reported to us.

To a police department which you knew was an accomplice to

Not necessarily knew.

Your informant told you that, hadn't he?

The informant is on one level. We have other informants
and we have other information.

You were aware that he had worked with certain members of
the Birmingham Police in order...

That's right. He furnished many other instances also.

So you really weren't doing a whole lot to prevent that
incident by telling the people who were already a part of it.

We were doing everything we could lawfully do at the
time and finally the situation was corrected when the Department
agreeing that we had no further jurisdiction, sent the U.S.
Marshals down to perform certain law enforcement functions.

...-This brings up the point as to what kind of control
you can exercise over this kind of informant and to this
kind of organization and to what extent an effort is made to
prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing
that you were supposedly trying to prevent.

A good example of this was Mr. Rowe who became active in
an Action Group and we told him to get out or we were no longer
using him as an informant in spite of the information he had
furnished in the past. We have cases, Senator where we have had

We did not tell him to participate in violent activities.
That's what he said.
I know that's what he says, but that's what lawsuits
are all about is that there are two sides to issues and our
Agent handlers have advised us, and I believe have advised: your
staff members, that at no time did they advise him to engage
in violence.

Just to do what was necessary to get the information.

I do not think they made any such statement to him
along that line either and we have informants who have gotten
involved in the violation of a law and we have immediately
converted their status from an informant to the subject and
have prosecuted I would say off hand, I can think of around
20 informants that we have prosecuted for violating the laws
once it came to our attention and even to show you our policy
of disseminating information on violence in this case during
the review of the matter the Agents have told me that they
found one case where an Agent had been working 24 hours a
day and he was a little late in disseminating the information
to the police department. No violence occurred but it showed
up in a file review and he was censured for his delay in
properly notifying local authorities. So we not only
have a policy, I feel that we do follow reasonable safeguards
in order to carry it out, including periodic review of all
informant files.
Mr. Rowe's statement is substantiated to some extent with

an acknowledgment by the Agent in Charge that if he were going

MR. ADAMS:

to be a Klansman and he happened to be with someone and they
decided to do something, he couldn't be an angel. These are
words of the Agent. And be a good informant. He wouldn't
take the lead but the implication is that he would have

to go along or would have to be involved if he was going

to maintain his liability as a ---

There is no question that an informant at times will
have to be present during demonstrations, riots, fistfights
that take place but I believe his statement was to the
effect that, and I was sitting in the back of the room and I do
not recall it exactly, but that some of them were beat with
chains and I did not hear whether he said he beat someone with
a chain or not but I rather doubt that he did, because it is
one thing being present, it is another thing taking an
active part in a criminal action.

It's true. He was close enought to get his throat cut
apparently.

How does the collection of information about an
individual's personal life, social, sex life and becoming
involved in that sex life or social life is a requirement for
law enforcement or crime prevention.

Our Agent handlers have advised us on Mr. Rowe that
they gave him no such instruction, they had no such knowledge
concerning it and I can't see where it would be of any

value whatsoever.

FOR NEARLY 50 y 50 years, Mr. J. Edgar
Hoover was a folk hero and the organiza:
tion that he shaped and headed was
thought of as the finest law enforcement
agency inthe world. Butnow theskeletons
are coming out of the closet. :

. Recent disclosures that Mr. Hoover
kept derogatory data on congressmen and
many.others, sought to discredit the Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr.,: : evidently ap-
proved a whole range of “dirty tricks” ina
war against various groups, and suc-
cumbed to political pressures of presi-
dents are tarnishing the irmage both of Mr.
* Hoover and the FBI.

o> +
Political abuse of the agency dates back
to the Roosevelt administration and in-
cludes spying on newsmen, government
officials and civil rights leaders under
Laer of both parties, according to
enate testimony.

The FBI's campaign against the Ku
. Klux Klan and its violence was called this
week the bureau’s “finest hour.” But a
one-time informant said the agency rare- .
‘ly acted to head off Klan attacks against
blacks and civil rights workers and that
the¥ BI condoned his participation in acts
of violence while ah was a Klan -
member. : |

The informant, Mr. Gary T. Rowe Jr:,

7 Mir. James B. Adams, the FBI’s deputy
associate director for investigation, told
the-senators the bureau did make mis-
takes but said he does not believe a

“balanced picture of its achievements has ~

emerged because “‘of the necessity to zero

in on abuses.”

The abuses area matter of concern. The |

role of an informant may be a dirty one

and it may be argued that now and then ©

the FBI has to resort to underhanded
tactics to deal with crime and violence.
~But the process of riding rough-shod-ever
civil liberties of those whose only fault

. was participating in the civil rights
movement, or those suspected of some-
thing by the White House, or the persecu-
tign of Dr. King has no justification at
all. :

'

_ Apparently it has been an accepted rule

in such agencies as the FBI or the CIA that

if the director ordered staff members to

engage in illegal or unconstitutional ac-
tivities, that was to be done.

,——— :

The Congress, which is elected by the

~people~to -represent ~their~interest, -has

- dene very little to oversee either the FBI.

or the intelligence community, tobe onthe °

- lookout for abuse, or to question what was
~ going on. sate

Mr. Hoover ran the burea”’ 3s a personal 7
fiefdom. And such was his , ‘tical clout -

- In many respects, it has done that. But

- asSen. Walter Mondale observed, it was a.

* consistent bungler in the field of political :

activities. ae
« The disclosures are saddening
the FBI, most of all, needs no such blots on
its reputation. But the message of such
disclosures comes through loud and
clear: Never again can the people and the
Congress take it for granted that the
government agencies are pure — or that
the White House is above reproach. And
henceforth, no FBI director should be
permitted to pou length of time fat

Plan to Discredit -
Militant Revealed

From Press Dispatches

WASHINGTON. — Late FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover approved a plan to discredit a Midwest black
militant leader with anonymous letters accusing him of |
adultery and of being a bureau informant, according to
FBI documents.

‘The documents, made available by the Senate intelli-
gence committee, show the bureau's campaign against

_ Charles E. Kosn lasted from 1968 to 1971 and was ap-

proved at each step of the way by Hoover. However, it
was unclear whether the letters were ever actually sent
to Koen, who a committee spokeswoman said is currently
a minister in Cairo, IIL. , >

According to the FBI documents, the campaign
against Koen began in November 1967 with a proposal by
St. Louis FBI officials to send him anonymous letter criti-
cizing him for referring to the possible use of violence in
his public speeches. :

‘Two months later, Hoover authorized the FBY’s Balti-
more office to send an anonymous letter to the No. 2 man

_ in the Black Liberator movement informing him that

Koen was working for either the CIA or FBI. The letter,
signed “A Soul Brother,” said Koen “was in Baltimore
last week and spent most of his time in the Justice Build-
ing. Don’t know whether that cat was talking to CIA or
FBI.” pena

In other developments, Democratic House and
Senate leaders have called for congressional inquiries
into the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Democratic Whip Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., urged a
“thorough probe” by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

porter for Newsweek magazine. They
were ordered as part of an investigation

sald, .

The other Kennedy approved taps were

and a congressional staff employe, Elliff
said, adding that they were related to an
investigation of efforts by foreign inter-
ests to influence U.S. economic policies.

Courtney Evans, a former liaison be-
tween Hoover and Kennedy, told the com-
mittee there is no evidence Kennedy ap-
proved the taps beyond a 30-day trial
period in 1963, But Evans said the assassi-
nation of President John F. Kennedy

occurred during that ime, and the late
attorney general was taken away from his
normal duties.
Elliff said investigators have found in

wiretaps placed on the kome telephones of i

“Hears 2:Sides

WASHINGTON (AP) — A top FBI official Tuesday
called the campaign against. the Ku Klux Klan the bu-
reau’s “finest hour.” But a one-time informant said

agents rarely acted to head off Klan attacks against
blacks and civil rights workers.

+ The informant, Gary Thomas Rowe Jr., wearing a
hood to mask his face, told the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee that FBI officials condoned his participation in
acts of violence while he was a Klan member from 1960
to1965. They also ordered him to sow dissension within 4
the Klan by sleeping with the wives of as. iad Klan

_ Members as possible, he-said, t

+ James Adams, the FBI's deputy associate di ector
for investigation, testified Rowe never was told to” in-

tee However, Sen. Walter Huddleston (D-Ky.) said
5 Rowe’s control agent has in effect corrobrated his story
py telling the committce Rowe “couldn’t be an angel-and

‘To The Commercial Appeal:

_,During the lengthy Watergate tur-
moil, I had an uneasy and unexplainable
feeling of animosity toward the news
media. Many people did. Even one televi-
sion reporter lamented the fact. “We did-
n't create Watergate,” he said, “we just
reported it. Why blame the news media
for it?”

At the time his statement seemed
superficially true, But since the confusion
and emotionalism of that time have died
down and we have been separated from it
by time, an element of objectivity has
been added to the feelings I had and in
retrospect I can now identify them
properly, = -°——F -

No, the news media didn’t create”
Watergate. But there have been many,
many scandalous situations that the public
had a right to know about that have gone
unreported for years — a drunken con-
gressman on the floor of the House, ques-
tionable relationships between public offi-
cials arid underworld figures, etc. There
are many things I'm sure we'll never

. know that the news media had access to

but never reported, I’m sure that Water-
gate would be overshadowed by the af-
fairs of some of our other presidents. And
this is not to say that two wrongs make a
right, either. It’s just that by singling out
Mr. Nixon to expose, the news media, in
effect, were sitting in judgment on him, It,

wasn't their reporting of
their motives in doing so.

‘Just as now with the exposure of the
FBI involvement with the Dr. Martin Lu
ther King scandal. They aren't exposing
the facts the FBI uncovered in their sur-
yeillance (for fear of damaging Dr. King's
reputation), just the methods the FBI used
jn uncovering those facts. What
hypocrisy. seerseeiat

Suppression of the news is suppres-
sion no matter what the reason. If a man’s
reputation is good enough reason for it,
then why are they condemning J. Edgar

- Hoover — a dead man, unable to come to
his own defense? What of his reputation?

It’s the news media’s selectivity in
reporting events that the public objects to
— not the facts themselves. People’s mo-
tives are sometimes much more important

than their actions.

‘Their efforts to discredit one man’s
reputation while shielding another's have
cost them the respect and confidence of
the American public.

A. years-long personal vendetta con-
ducted by the FBI’s late director, J.
Edgar Hoover, against the late Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr., has now been re-
vealed in testimony before the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

If the American people aren’t appall-
ed by.the revelations, they should be.

Some of the facts of the FBI’s cam-
paign of harrassment agaiast King, and
its continued efforts to compromise him,
have emerged piecemeal! in the past.

But only now, in the light of evidence
presented to the committee, is it possi-
ble to assess the degree to which the
FBI under Hoover transgressed against
the civil rights of King and thousands of
other-sitisens.

For, as James Adams, FBI assistant
director in charge of intelligence, told
the committee this week, there was no
legal. basis to justify the seven-year ef-
fort to discredit King. During that peri-
od, only one surveillance of King was
approved by an attorney general, Robert
F. Kennedy.

In spite of mammoth wiretapping and
bugging cperations aimed at proving
that King wes under “Communist influ-
ence,” no real evidence was found.

Beyond that, the FBI at Hoover’s urg-
ing did its best to compromise King with
tales of alleged marital infidelity. It also
took upon itself the task of finding a
“new national Negro leader” to promote
in place. of King. Nothing came of that.

And in 1964, shortly before King was

“Hoover, King and the FET

to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the
FBI sent him an anonymous letter con-
taining a veiled suggestion that he com-
mit suicide,

Committee testimony also shows that
during Hoover’s directorship the FBI
compiled dossiers on half a million
Americans, often using “dirty and dan-
gerous” tactics similar to those used
against foreign spies.

These transgressions — and they
were transgressions, no matter how
well-meaning the motives may have

been — are difficult for Americans to~
, comprehend in the context of their free

and open society.
And, coming on the heels of revela-

«__tions of similar transgressions by the

CIA in recent years, they are doubly
hard,

But now, at least, the facts are on the
record, and it isn’t too late to begin a
fresh chapter i in the history of an agency
that has, in the main, served this coun-
try well.

FBI Director Clarence Kelley has
urged Congress to exercise more control

over the bureau and thus help “restore *

any breach of credibility”
suffered,

“I would not object at all to come to
Congress and report to the committee
with oversight authority and tell them
exactly what we are doing and how we
are doing it,” he said.

‘Black Leaders Say:
| Acts Against King”
More Than Believed:

* Memphis black leaders who were associated with Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. before his assassination here in
1968 said yesterday they were generally aware that Dr.
King was threatened by the FBI. is

However, most said they had not reafized the extent
of the threat, and one said the disclosures that the FBI
had waged a campaign to discredit Dr. King bring into
question the investigation of his murder.

‘The staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee Tues-
day revealed that the FBI’s campaign had included send-
ing Dr. King a letter which he interpreted as a sugges-
tion that he commit suicide. the planting of 16 electronic
bugs and 8 wiretaps and an effort to Promote another
black leader.

This calls for a whol he log at the investigative
process that went into the King murder,” said Rey. Sam-
uel B. Kyles, pastor of Monumental Baptist Church and
head of Operation PUSH.

The black leaders said Dr. King had mentioned at-
tempts by the FBI to intimidate him but had never gone
into detail.

“On occasion he said he knew he was being spied on,
that his room was bugged. But his position was that he
-was not plotting to overthrow the government, | he was not.
a Communist and he was not in conspiracy,” said Mr.
Ryles.

“We had not had a discussion on the threats: He had
mentioned to me, in fact to a eroup, of us, about being
intimidated by the FBI,

“He said he was not goihg to be intimidated, but he
did not go into detail, That was just in a general conver-
sation when we were discussing about being prepared to
pay the price,” said Rev. H. Ralph Jackson, director of
the AME Church's Department of Minimum Salary.

The black leaders believe the-animosity of the late J.
Edgar Hoover, then director of the FBI, was personal and
said they didn’t then realize its extent.

“King became an obsession with him because he let
it become personal,” said Rev. Henry L..Starks, pastor of
St. James AME Church.

“I don't think people really understood the extent of
Hoover’s personal dislike of King. I think he felt he
should have been given the Nobel prize that year — any--
body but Dr. King,” said Mr. Kyles. Dr. King received .
the-Nobel nzace prize in 1965, 34 days after he received
the letter suggesting suicide from the FBI. ~ i

The black leaders said they also felt threatened, at -
the time of their major civil rights activities in the 1960s.
“I'm certain that the people working with Dr. King

“were aware they were being spied on and things would--

be used against them and that they were in as.much
danger from law enforcement people as from people out-
side the law,” said Vasco Smith Jr., now a County Court
squire.

Mrs. Maxine Smith, his wife and the executive secre-
tary of the Memphis branch of the NAACP, said she and
others were aware Jong’ before King's death that tele-
phones of civil rights leaders were tapped and that law
enforcement agencies were looking for information that
could-be-used-to discredit them,

She said she also believes her telephone has been
tapped sporadically since her election to the Memphis
Board of Education.

Mrs. Smith and others were outraged because of the
FB activities and surprised at their extent. 7

“T could never conceive that people could be this
cruel, this brutal,” she said. “If this country is willing to
destroy some of the greatest minds it can pr

. can't understand what this country is all about.” 7



FD-350 (Rev. 7-16-63)

THE REVELATIONS about former

“RBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s obsession

with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. fall
heavily in Memphis,

Tt was the FBI which took over the
investigation of the assassination of Dr.
Ring here after the April 4, 1968, tragedy.
Details of the investigation learned later
showed that it was a herculean effort
which resulted, with an assist from Scot-
Jand Yard, in the arrest of James Earl
Ray. At the time of King’s death, however,
‘suspicions of a conspiracy were rampant,
especially among blacks.

‘The suspicions were fed by. the stand-
ard retort of “no comment” to questions

-and the instant and total embargo on
. information by Jaw enforcement agencies.

‘The evidence of an FBI campaign to
destroy King’s influence brought out in

. Senate Intelligence Committee hearings

tggravates those lingering suspicions
even though there has been no persuasive

evidence of coverup or conspiracy.

EVIDENCE in the committee hear-
ings shows that Hoover ordered reports
that King was not a threat to the country
rewritten to coincide with what must be
considered his personal prejudice. Hoov-
er’s fixation against King is evident in the
tawdry letter and tape recording sent
anonymously by the FBI to King 34 days
before he received the 1964 Nobel Peace
Prize. The sender, after alleging knowl-
edge of unsavory activities by the civil
rights leader, said he had “only one way
out.” That way has been construed to
mean suicide.

King did go on to accept the prize.
And he went on; until his death in Mem-

-phis, to marshal efforts in the struggle

against injustices to blacks and the poor.
Despite the FBI’s six-year effort to dis-
credit him, neither his resoive nor his
courage were shaken. Indeed, Hoover's
failure can be regarded as particular cor-
rohoration of that resolve and that cour-

Dr. King And The FBI

The FBI’s campaign against King
should not be taken as a general indict-
ment of the bureau. It should not include
the thousands of professionals within the
bureau who always have and continue to
do valuable service. And even though it
has become fashionable of late to criticize
Hoover, it should not be forgotten that he
was the man who seized control in the
1920s from political hacks and hangers on
and built the FBI into what is still consid-
ered the most efficient law enforcement
agency in the world.

Hoover was a man who stayed on be-
yond his time, secure in a power nurtured
by self-appointed sycophants. His career,
despite contemporary criticism, was more
admirable than not, but in the final chap-
ter he cast a shadow on that in which he
had so much pride. 7

aan

A POLICE czar is contrary to the

-ideals of this nation. Such power must not

be allowed for one man again. Account-
ability must be demanded, even as it is
being demanded now.

ta recent speech, the present direc-
tor, Clarence Kelley concedes that
“perhaps our operations will derive bene-
fit from the unprecedented surge of news
media and official interest in the FBI.”

It is unlikely Hoover would have
made such a concession.

But having said that, Kelley also
Pointed out that “the threat posed by le-
thal bands of revolutionaries, hate groups
and extremists who openly espouse vio-
lence and hostility to our system of gov-
ernment” still exists.

“Unchecked,” he said, “these ped-
dlers of death and destruction represent a
very genuine threat to the freedom and
tranquility of people like you — law-abid-

ing and productive citizens throughout the

nation.”

That fact should not be forgotten,
even as the FBI is being held accountable
for past sins and struggles to regain the
public confidence it needs if, it_is to he

WASHINGTON. — (AP) — The FBI con-
ducted hundreds of break-tne—egaiast
“domestic subversive targets” over a 26-
year period ending in 1968, the chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee said
today. oy

Releasing information supplied to the
committee by the FBI, Sen. Frank Church,
D-Idaho,. said there were 238 break-ins
conducted against 14 “domestic subver-
sive targets” from 1942 to 1968 and
“numerous entries” against three other
similar targets from 1952 to 1966.

Charles Brennan, former head of the
FBI's Domestic Intelligence Division,
testified that the FBI's use of break-ins as
an intelligence-gathering tool began to die
out in the early 1960s.

Brennan said it was his opinion that the

‘ice was curtailed as a result of ins

aged emphasis on organized crime an‘

ivil rights, and of the late FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover's. fear of creating an
embarrassing incident which would give
critics a chance to demand his resignation
as he neared the mandatory retirement
age.

In other action the committee wants*to
question former President Nixon about a
CIA program of opening and copying for-
eign mail to U.S. citizens, even including .
one letter to Nixon. . i

The decision to ask Nixon to testify on
this and other matters was announced *
Wednesday by Church, James Angleton,
former CIA chief of counterintelligence,
told the committee intelligence agencies

illegally opened private mail over a ‘period
of 20 years.

The victims, according to Angleton’s
‘testimony and statements by Church, in-
cluded Nobel Peace prize winner Linus
Pauling and Martin Luther King Jr.,

intelligence operations, including
break-ins in New York City and Chica-

of extremist and subversive activities ,
and few convictions, Congress was told
Wednesday.

In delivering a comprehensive anal-

break-ins in New York and one in
Chicago in the early 1960s.

ard L. Fogel, an assistant GAO division
director. “We didn’t get any indication

Only 16 of the 676 cases were refer

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Memorandum
TO +] ALL EMPLOYEES DATE: 9/8/75
hia SAC, MEMPHIS (66-2150)

exci SENSTUDY 75
Re Bureau nitel dated 9/4/75.

The Bureau has pledged full cooperation with
the Senate Select Committee (SSC) arid has set forth
new procedures relating to SSC staff interviews of
current and former FBI employees. The Bureau in the
past on learning of SSC interest in a current or
former employee has alerted that employee of possible
interview and reminded him of his confidentiality
agreement with the Bureau and suggested that if he
is contacted for interview, he may contact the Legal
Counsel Division by collect call for further information,
Usually the employee is told that he has a right to
legal counsel but the Bureau cannot provide same; that
the Bureau has waived the confidentiality agreement
for the interview within specified parameters and
that there are four privileged areas in which he is
not required to answer questions, These areas relate
to information which may identify a Bureau source,
reveal sensitive methods or techniques, reveal identities
of third agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies
or information from such agencies and areas that might :~
adversely affect ongoing Bureau investigations. A
supervisor has been provided for such consultations with
the employee or former employee.

Effective immediately the Bureau will no
longer provide on-the-scene personnel for consultation
‘purposes and the prospective interviewees should be
told that if they desire assistance of this nature
during the interview they may contact either personally
(if interview is in Washington, D, C.) or by collect
call the Assistant Director of the Intelligence eee
Mr. W. R, WANNALL, or in his absence, Section oD,

This change in procedure should not be
construed as lessening the assistance we are furnishing
to current and former employees.

The Director further advised he was exploring
avenues with the Department of Justice to arrange
legal representation as necessary for current and former
employees without expense to them. Results of this
effort will be forwarded to all divisions,
