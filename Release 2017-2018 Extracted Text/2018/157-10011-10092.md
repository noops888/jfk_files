MR. OLSEN: To use the house term, he was a spook?

MR. MARCHETTI: Yes. He was a very exotic character.

And all kinds of stories float around about Jim Angleton. And

I am sure that some are nothing more than apocryphal and some

are pure rumor.

What intrigued me about this Runge thing is that

subsequently another reporter - and this time the guy identi-

fied the man he had been talking to - the man he had been

talking to was Bill Harvey, who was one of the people respon-

sible for exposing Philby, in fact Philby gives Harvey the

credit in his book under a pseudonym - that Harvey said to

this guydoh, yes, the Agency - to this reporter -- yes, the

Agency has been penatrated, it may even, be now -- he made some

pompous Statements of that nature. But then when the guy tried

to dig deeper, Harvey held him at arm's length.

MR. OLSEN: Who is Harvey?

MR. MARCHETTI: Bill Harvey was a scenario officer.

He bad been among other, things, chiet of Baser

He had been Head of the Cuban task force.

MR. OLSEN: Which Cuban task force do you refer to

now?

MR. OLSON: Yes. You mentioned that in your book, I

believe, don't vou?

MR. MARCHETTI: I was in the Agency at the time, that

happened, but I knew practically nothing about it in the Agency

For one reason, I didn't pay any attention to it.. I had no

reason to. But it was after getting out of the Agency.

kind of use in the us you might be aware of?

MR. MARCHATTI: That wasn't what I meant by that.

What I meant was, it worked good under laboratory conditions

here, but when I would take it out to the field, it wouldn't

work.

MR. MARCHETTI: No, I was not.

But that is that system that people are talking about

now,

the laser people bugging system, where they can get

building across the street there and direct a beam here and

pick it up. It has become quite popular in recent years, at

least they talk about it.

MRow OLSEN: YOu mean in the spy literature?

embassies at page 199. And there is no reference to any

particular embassy. Are you avare of any activity where the
