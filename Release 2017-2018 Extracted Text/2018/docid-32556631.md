investigation:

According to the PJSN (Police Judiciaire, Streté
Nationale), subject registered at the Hotel Bristol, Paris,
on 1-16-65. At that time he gave his date of birth as
4-1-16 in Illinois, and ‘presented U. Ss. passport B 4019963,
which was issued 10-16-61 at Chicago, Illinois. He was

- accompanied by DIETGARD ROSE MARIE FUEGER, who was born

Identity Card RZ_ 45437, which was issued 8-12-61, and her
home address was listed as 177 Promenade des Anglais, Nice,
