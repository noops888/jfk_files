On 3-1-65 the Police Judiciaire (Criminal Police),

Strete Nationale, furnished the following additional information

in the captioned

matter, which had been developed by further

investigation:

According to the PJSN (Police Judiciaire, Sûreté

Nationale), subject registered at the Hotel Bristol, Paris,

on 1-16-65.

At that time he gave his date of birth

4-1-16 in Illinois, and

presented U. S. passport B 4019963,

Which was issued 10-16-61 at Chicago, Illinois. He was

accompanied by DIETGARD ROSE MARIE FUEGER, who was born

12-3-38 at Seewalchen, Austria.

According to the hotel

records, FUEGER was listed as being in possession of French

Identity Card RZ. 45437, which was issued 8-12-61, and her

home address was listed as 177 Promenade des Anglais, Nice,

France.

It was subsequently ascertained by the PJSN that

through an error at the reception desk of the hotel, the

identifying information was erroneously attributed to FUEGER

at the time she registered.

The PJSN later interviewed

THERESE GARELLI, another customer of the hotel at that

time, verified

that the identity card in question actually

belonged to her, and established that she had no knowledge

of or connection with subject or FUEGER.

The PJSN stated that subject and FUEGER departed

the hotel on 1-20-65 for an unknown destination.
