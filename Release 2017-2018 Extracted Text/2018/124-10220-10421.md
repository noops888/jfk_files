where possible, has been verified. His identity was re-

cently determined, and CIA plans to intervlew him 1f,

or when, he departs Guba for Mexico City. BACKu)

be conducted to determine if there is such an individual

in the MANOLO RAY group known as the Junta Revolucionaria

tion, New York will advise Miami of the results of their

investigation conceming this individual.

information of the Bureau, the CIA agent now handling this
