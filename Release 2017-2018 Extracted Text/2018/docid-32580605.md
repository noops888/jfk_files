RE: JOHN’ROSELLTI, aka ,
AR

ROSSELLI resided at his Los Angeles apartment
7/30/ 31, and 8/1/63, but LA 4396-c* furnished no information
other than the fact that he was at the apartment on these dates.
This’ source and a neighborhood source advised he did not return
to his apartment evewing 8/1/63 and not there morning 6/2/63.

JACK WALTERS, PCI, Manager, Beverly Crest Hotel,
Beverly Hills, California, advised that MABHICE FRIEDMAN
and wife, NORMA arrived at this hotel on 7/27/63 and are still
at the hotel. FRIEDMAN is part owner New Frontier Hotel,
Las Vegas, and close friend of ROSSELLI. PCI said that
FRIEDMAN has not left taWh since’ arrival and goes daily to
the Friar's Club in Beverly Hills. .

Sales Manager, Doheny Plaza Apartments, where
ROSSELLI has made a reservation to buy an apartment, stated that
no further committment has been made by ROSSELLI and the
"Reservation" is a very loose arrangement, binding neither
on ROSSELLI northe apartment owners. The manager stated that
inasmuch as ROSSELLI has put no money down he does not
pelieve ROSSELLI is really serious about purchasing an
apartment. :
