JOHN• ROSELLI, aka

ROSSELLI resided at his Los Angeles apartment

7/30, 31, and 8/1/63, but LA 4396-C* furnished no information

other than the fact that he was at the apartment on these dates.

This source and a neighborhood source advised he did not return

to his apartment evening 8/1/63 and not there morning 8/2/63.

JACK WALTERS,

PCI, Manager, Beverly Crest Hotel,

Beverly Hills, California,

advised that MABHICE FRIEDMAN

and wife, NORMA arrived at this hotel on 7/27/63 and are still

at the hotel. FRIEDMAN is part owner New Frontier

Hotel,

Las Vegas, and close friend of ROSSELLI. PCI said that

FRIEDMAN has not left toon since arrival and goes daily to

the Friar's Club in Beverly Hills.

Sales Manager, Doheny Plaza Apartments, where

ROSSELLI has made a reservation to buy an apartment, stated that

no further committment has been made by ROSSELLI and the

"Reservation" is a very loose arrangement, binding neither

on ROSSELLI nor the apartment owners.

The manager stated that

inasmuch as ROSSELLI has put no money down he does not

believe ROSSELLI is really serious about purchasing an

apartment.
