In a memorandum dated 2 August 1964, the Commission requested
permission to publish in it s report certain memo provided by CIA.
Among them was our memo dated 22 July relative to apparent incon-
sistencies in material furnished the Commission by CIA and the
Department of State. Our memo of 11 September 196 denied this
request on the grounds that the information therein was for back-
ground use only. However, Mr. Slawson requested orally that we
provide a memo for publication which contained the substantive
material in our 22 July memo. The oral request was made on ap-
proximately 16 September 196), and the attached memo was prepared
and forwarded to the Vomission on approximately 1 October 196).
The date of the item is 11 September 1964, and is one of an unknown
number backdated in the office of DDP before forwarding.
