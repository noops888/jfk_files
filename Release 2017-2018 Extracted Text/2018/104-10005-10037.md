BY SR/CI/RESEARCH entitled

"CERTAIN QUESTIONS POSED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT FILES"

See. XAAZ-22406 for chronological listing.

In a memorandum dated 2L August 1964, the Commission requested

permission to publish in it s report certain memo provided by CIA.

Among them was our memo dated 22 July relative to apparent incon

sistencies in material furnished the Commission by CIA and the

Department of State. Our memo of Il September 1964 denied this

request on the grounds that the information therein was for back-

ground use only

However, at Slawson requested orally that we

provide a memo for publication which contained the substantive

material in our 22 July memo.

The oral request was made on ap-

proximately 16 September 196k, and the attached memo was prepared

and forwarded to the 'omission on approximately 1 October 1964.

The date of the item is 1l September 1964, and is one of an unknown

number backdated in the office of DDP before forwarding.
