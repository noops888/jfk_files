Office of Legislative Counsel
23 August 1978

DDCIs:

Pardon the form of this communication, but it
Should get to you this morning early.

Profiising negotiations on the Proenza and’ Mexico
history came apart yesterday eveming when Blakey came
back on the scenes ie seemed to be on the verge of
agreeing that they would accept a five months period
from the Proenza 201 file (not the ops file) and
Sanitized sections of the Hexico history, limited to

ue Blakey and Cornell only. No junior or other HSCA
ia eee staffers. We viewed this as showing that the papers
: had nothing to do with the HSGA charter, while showing
good faith at the same time.

Blakey arguesgthat he must see the entire Mexico
City history (some20]years worth) to understand the
Station, which he Intends to try to evaluate. He also |
7 : . plans to go to Havana'again, where he plans to inter~
1 : : suetcesi view Proenza, and wants to know everything about her,

: : etce, in pr: ation for his meeting wi
continue to

th hers We
vel it hasn't anything to do with the
SS seca sa a real HSCA charter.

Blakey made it clear that if he sees it he will
want staff members Also to see it, the likely |
candidates being highly umacceptable for their remark |
able ianaturity.

Stokes is out of town, but Blakey says he can get}
in touch with him. If we have to go throngh Blakey i
Stokes! answer doubtleas will be "zive."

We Seem to have run this course,
the threat of supbeena hanzng over us, I propose an _
early meeting: Acting 020 (perhaps with Chiefs LA Div~ |
isbn and GA Staff), General Counsel, lesislat
and Mee sy :
