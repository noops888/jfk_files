American who had strong anti-American views and who was a
professed Marxist? Would they have any interest in that

kind of person?

Mr. Nosenko. Here were are coming to a very interesting!

and sensitive question. From mid-1950, by the order of
Central Committee Communist ewe Soviet Union, KGB was
prohibited to make any approachment and recruitment of
members of the Communist Party of the West.

Mr. Klein. I am not asking about a member of the
Communist Party.

Mr. Nosenko. Your question is, and if he is some type
of mnie here, the question maybe he is possibly a member
of Communist cParty, and to check it for KGB very difficult
if he is a member of ‘Communist Party or not of his country.

Mr. Klein. Would they ask him if he is a member of

the Communist Party? :

i
Would they check it?

Mr. Nosenko. No, they would -not ask him.

Mr. Klein. they wouldn't ask him?

Mr. Nosenko. ‘No; till they were leave the Soviet

Oswald was allowed to stay in the Soviet Union after he said |

Mr. Klein. They would rather keep him in the Soviet

Union? : :
|

Mr. Nosenko. No,| they would rather prefer they washed

their hands, Mr. Klein; they are not making decision, KGB.

In, Soviet Union decisions are made by the Central Committee

of the Cohimunist Party, and General Secretary and Politburo,
not by KGB. KGB a servant of the Politburo and Central Commit,
tae Communist Party. : |
Mr.- Klein. Going by the facts as you have told them

to this Committee --

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.

Mr. Klein. -- why wasn't he put on a plane and sent
back to America?

Mr. Nosenko. KGB washed their hands. Then from Intouri

it was given information Ministry of Foreign Trade; Ministry

of Foreign Trade reported to the Soviet Government. As I saia

I assumed the Chairman was surely asked; he told his opinion
of the KGB, and up to the Soviet Government how they, would
decide.

Mr. Klein. Could he have been brought to the U.S.

Embassy and told them he is an American, "You take care of

him; we don't want him"?

it wasn't done.

BLUME b.
Soviet citizéns with foreign. A foreigner can marry a Soviet

citizen, by the law. There is not a thing that KGB can in an

way try not to give, not to make it possible, but this is in H

cases when the person who is marrying a foreigner worked in
some sensitive place, let's say, in missiles, rocket
industry production, was in process of -any place of his workr
ing seeing classified material. In these cases, KGB will try
to put different type of fences. But it is unlawful, In
accordance with Soviet law, marriage is allowed; he doesn't |
need to ask permission of Soviet Government or anyone. And his
wife, Marina, wasn't working in any place which was sensitive|
from the point of view of Soviet security.

Mentally unstable it doesn't-mean that he is raving
mad; it is*mentally ‘unstable.

Mr. Klein, You testified that not only was Oswald not
spoken to when he first said he wanted to defect but even after
the decision was made to allow him to remain in the Soviet

)
|
Union, still nobody from the KGB spoke to him, is that correct?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.
|

Mr. Klein. You also tetified to the extensive resources;

that were devoted to put physical and technical surveillance

the facilities involved? }

Mr. Nosenko. - No, sir.
Mr. Klein. -= in the fact ‘that, on the one hand, you
put all these resources into following Oswald around, trying to
See who he talked to and what he does and, on the other hand, |
you don't even have a. person go and talk to him and ask him, |

“Tell us your background; tellus about yourself."

Is there any contradiction? ,
Mr. Nosenko. Even in the United States, yes, sure, for
you, for me just now American citizens, yes, sure, but ee
no.
Mr. Klein. They don't talk to people there? i
Mr. Nosenko. They can talk and cannot to talk, but I
don't see contradiction there. ‘Anyone, any foreigner who. will

be staying, even if this defector not on his own, but, let's

i
say, KGB pushed him to stay, to defect, he still will be watched

and on him-will be put this same type of work that was

put on Oswald, not less.

Mr. Klein. You talk about their society is different than
ours. -Is it unusual that they allow an American to defect
and. live. there without ever questioning him, to ask him if h

Mr. Klein. They purposely don't speak to him; is that
your testimony?
Mr. Nosenko. -In this case they didn't speak with him

because he didn't present interest for the KGB and becatse

ihe was mentally unstable.

Mr. Klein... You.testified that you read the reports of

two. psychiatrists who examined Lee Harvey Oswald at the

hospital after he cut his wrist, is that. correct?

Mr. Nosenko. "Right.

be doing, and at the same time a person feels attitude on the
part of those who helped him to come CIA? I felt something
going on.

Mr. Klein. -You testified to us today. that you didn't
know how wrote the summary of Oswald's file in the First Depart-
ment. because you never had an opportunity to read it. Did you
ever tell anyone that Fedroseve:and Matveev, Fze-d-r-o0-s-e-v-e
and M-a-t-v-e-e-v of the First Department, Second Chief
Directorate, took the file and wrote a second "spravka", which
you told us was a summary?

Mr. Nosenko. Summary.

Mr. Klein. Did you ever tell anybody that?

Mr. Nosenko. Must be I told, it is again right, because
you see, not Fedroseve -- Fedroseve was Chief of First Depart-
ment, American Department, and I will repeat what I told you
yesterday. Matveev has come to take file, but surely Fedroseve
who is Chief of American Department, he had given call to Chief
of Seventh Department. He was involved in this; that is why I
mentioned him. He was Chief of First American Department.

His deputy, Colonel Matveev, has come, and not alone; with him
was a couple of officers, has come and told that Gribanov

ordered and Fedroseve giving call to Department, we must take
it, and took. Who of them wrote, I do not know, no .doubts :that Fedroseve,

and Matveev. were participated in the preparation of ‘documents.

Did you ever tell anybody that? |

in this case when Oswald was allowed to stay. In the moment

Mr. Nosenko. I could say my opinion, yes.

Mr. Klein. Does it say anything there aboutya meeting

Lee .Harvey Oswald, from your testimony, was greeted somewhat

like this in’the U.8.S.R. ‘His’ treatment was.much different

12 | from yours. fe

@ 13 | One thing he was not an intelligence agent, of course.

But you have indicated that he was kept at arms' length by the

caused the KGB to be less interested in him than if.it was |

13 | Mr. Nosenko. Right.

19 Mr. Preyer. Although he was kept at arms' length: by the |

. that he lived very well here? relatively speaking. He cer- {

But amount of pay of his was analogical to the amount of pay
of the Director of this Institute, besides what he is

whom they want, who had given them valuable information.

In case of -- excuse me -- was Annabella Bucar defected
something early '50s. She was working in American Embassy in
Press Department. She also received, in spite of the fact
was making very. good money in the Soviet Union, she was working

for Moscow Radio, she was receiving life pension of big amount,

of Minister, of Ministry, of this or that industry.

Mr. Preyer. But the defector who was not giving informa-
tion? ,

Mr. Nosenko. Now, he will be given a little bit something,
pension like was Oswald, to Oswald given pension. I don't
know what was given to Webster, a worker, who was defected in '59
and by the way, in very short period of time-he decided he i
doesn't like the life in the so-called Soviet paradise. He
wanted to return back home, but if he received it will be
analogical to what Oswald received, not more.

@. 4 Mr. Devine. Why did you defect?
5 Mr. Nosenko. I défected because I for years of my life

6 | has come to number of conclusions that the whole society, the
7 | whole system, is dictatorial system, nondemocratic system,

8 || the true police state system, and especially working the

9 || KGB opened eyes for me. My defection was strictly on ideologi+

and that is why when I contacted CIA in '62, I s- psychologicall

I was ready, ideologically was ready and psychologically ready

to defect, but. the question of family was bothering me.

Mr. Devine. But not enough to keep you there?

Mr. Nosenko. Not enough to keep me there. And in '64
I has come knowing that I will never return.

Mr. Devine. You were willing to abandon your family?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir, because I didn't see possibility
to take family out: I was living the last four or five years
as a man with two souls, splitted personality, one I must show
and was showing, as good KGB officer, as a good Communist, as

a patriot of the Soviet system, the Soviet Union, and the other

| part of me, the true part I am not believing in what I am

telling, I am not believing in the system, I do not like it,
I do not want it, and I consider what phony things are going
on because I was working in KGB, I knew it. I simply couldn't
more tolerate to be with this double splitted personality.

Mr. Devine. How did you dispose of your children and your
wife in Russia?

Mr. Nosenko. The thing was psychologically, my had, had
in my mind. help me. My mother was rather rich, after death of
father, she was very rich woman and she had a lot that will be
enough not only for my children but their children and grand-
children. From the point of view of material they will never

Mr. Devine. Yes,but as a defector would there not be

reprisals taken by the Soviet Union against your family?

Mr. Nosenko. Sir, before the death of Stalin it could
be taken drastic measures against the family, but after the
death of Stalin, from middle 1950s, quite a little changes took
place in the Soviet Union, and the family will not suffer.

Another thing, oh sure, will be certain things. which they
cannot achieve. Let's say my brother who studied later in
the same Institute what I finish, Institute of International
Relations, he will never have possibility to go abroad, but
he will never be put in jail, can never be exiled from Moscow,
the same, nothing happened with family.

Mr. Devine. The fact that you were a KGB man didn't your
defection eatise some irritation among those in power over thereq

Mr. Nosenko. Sure.

Mr. Devine. Did they want to get you back, didn't they
want to get even with you?

Mr. Nosenko. Oh, yes, and they are looking for me.

Mr. Devine. But they took no reprisals against your family.

Mr. Nosenko. No.

Mr. Devine. How do you know that?

'

Mr. Nosenko. Well, I do not know exactly, but you see, |

it was, let's say, in '40s and maybe up to death of Stalin.

Mr. Sawyer. I see.

I will tell you what bothers:me about your testimony, very
frankly. You stated that they would be very interested in a \
member of the American intelligence community that they could |
even compel to defect. Here you had a willing defector, a guy
who said that undoubtedly that he didn't like America, and

that he did like Russia, and he wants to defect, and nobody

even interrogates him, according to you, as to what exposure or

\



(OP SECRET 97

experience he had, He might have worked in the missile silos,

2 |The might have done anything, but nobody asked him, and that he
3 | lives there for a period of, a long period of time. Here is a
e. 7 4 guy that is totally willing to talks. It is not like approaching
5 | somebody who doesn't want to talk to you or that might not want
6 || to talk to you. And here is a fellow who was a radar operator,

7 experienced to some degree, and I don't know to what degree,

8 |} but apparently the Russians don't know to what degree either,
9 | because nobody asked him,
10 | but they didn't ask him even about that, and it is very rare
_ 11 |} to have one come.
12 I have listened to Radio Free Cuba, where they air all
e.. 3 | kinds of propaganda, and this guy would have been certainly
14 good for propaganda when he loved Russia and hated the United
“1S States. And I just, with those Occ seen se. I very frankly

16 | find it almost impossible to believe that they did not

16 | Mr. Nosenko, as I piece it together, there are four
q

17 || possibilities for this Committee to believe. Let me sketch
1g | out what those possibilities are.

19 One, that you told the truth in 1964, but you are now
20 || misleading this Committee.

ra] Two, that you told an untruth _in 1964, basically your

2 | statements in 1964 were not true put you are telling the truth

93 || now.

74 Three, that in fact you were dispatched here’ by the KGB,

or the Soviet Government, because of apparent but unreal

connections between the Soviets and Oswald and the assassinatio

100

of President Kennedy. Obviously the USSR would need this for
obvious reasons. They would badly need this for all sorts of
international reasons.

And finally, the fourth option is that you were dispatched
here by the Soviet Government and the KGB because there was an
actual connection between the KGB and the assassinationvof*
President Kennedy.

These are the items which I have picked up in the last
two days that.would .tend to lead some people to believe the
last of the four, or at least the third to the last of the four,

either that the KGB dispatched you here.because they needed it

dispatched you here because in fact they did collaborate with
Oswald.

First, Oswald goes to Russia. You say he is rejected, b
they grant him a pension, however..small.

Second, they grant him the pleasures of a hunting club,
even though you said earlier he was mentally unbalanced, and
you are allowing him to use a gun.

Three, they allowed him to marry in Russia.

Four, they gave him a. job,

Now, in -- not talking about the time when you were {
under stress and incarcerated, but just talking about the two

months prior to that -- the FBI questioning, and the prearrest

»against Oswald, you’ said, yet later on you said you had seven

story makes no sense.

The rejection of Oswald's offer to defect makes absolutely
no sense to me.

Mr. Sawyer has’ just pursued that momentarily. I think. that
can be rejected by us, by reasonable people,prima facie. I see
ho reason to accept that part of your story whatsoever.

The exposition, taking zai ofE to worry about the exposi~
tion, and so forth, was demonstrated a fraud.

No reprisals against your familys. Nobody was working 7

to eight large files, you only read the first portion of one
file. You said no KGB ever ‘talked to Oswald regarding

letting him defect. The reason you gave us for that was that he
slashed his wrists and you concluded he was. unstable. Yet prior
to that discovery of his instability, you granted him a visa

in two days and he asked to be permitted to defect prior to
slashing his wrists, and therefore you had to make the decision
prior to slashing his writs, prior to knowing that he slashed
his wrist, that you were going to reject him. That doesn't
hold..water either.

Finally, you said in your testimony American defection was
very rare. ‘All the more reason, if it only happens once every -
year or a couple of times a year, or three times between '56
and '59, it ig totally incredible to me that he would not have |

been interrogated. No reasonable person can believe that story

eo TOP. SECRET | a

You said he was not interesting, you were not interested

io 21 in him, the KGB rejected him. Despite that, you were “recruiting
3 right and left all kinds of people'to assist in the espionage
4 operation."
5

Now, all of these things, Mr. Nosenko, leads me to be
6 || very, very disturbed by your story because it simply just on tHe

7 || ace of what you told us last night and tonight, can't possibly

, 8 |lbe true.
9 In the first place, you remember too much now. You remember
10 too much in the way of details after 15 years. Therefore, I
1 jj have great difficulty accepting any of your story.
2 We as a Committee of the United States Congress are charged
[ 13 }with trying to assess what actually happened in the assassinatian
i4 }of President Kennedy. That is the central story. You have not

prior to our recess a’ few moments ago you indicated that you
felt that the tapes and the FBI and the CIA interrogations of
'64, '65, and '66 should not be considered as reliable

Is that not correct?

- Mr. Nosenko. Yes, because I considered the whole arrest
was unlawful, without due process of law, illegal arrest,
what was the finding as unlawful by Rockefeller Commission.

Mr. Edgar. Thank you.

You were held under those spartan conditions and you
indicated that those statements would have to be unreliable.

Now, I have three specific questions, then, to ask you.

Have you ever told the CIA that these statements could
not be considered reliable?

Mr. Nosenko. Sure, when we started, they change the
situation, they moved me from spartan conditions, started to
talk with me as a human being, to treat me as a human being.

eo 2 42 major piece of evidence, and was so considered by the Warren

@ 4 nation of Lee Harvey Oswald, and I think the key part of your

6 jlabout any inconsistencies in it, but are you right on the big
7 question, namely, wasLee Harvey Oswald a KGB agent?
8 I want to mention, I have been a little surprised by your
9 !testimony, bythe gaps in your knowledge of Oswald, and really
0 Ihow little you knew about him. For example, when he went to
W IMinsk, he’ was tranferred out of your oversight, I take it, and
12 jas I understood you, you did not know he was married until
@ : 13 en on, and did not know he had gone back ‘to the United

19 Mr. Preyer. Right. Now, I am not questioning you about

20 |ithat. The question I wonder, that that brings to my mind is,

21 lic Oswald-had been a KGB agent, are you certain you would have |
known it? In other words, if you didn't even know he was

married, didn't even know he had gone to the United States, |

24 |couldn't he have been a KGB agent in that period without your

When she was there, did she interview Oswald?

Mr. Nosenko. I know it is now reading here the books. I
didn't know that she interviewed. I only found out it with
living in the United States, with reading books.

Mrs. Burke. That she interviewed him. That didn't show
in your file?

Mr. Nosenko. I didn't read her book -- this is what in
some other books mentioned that she had interviewed him.

Mrs. Burke. Let me’ ask again about Oswald in Minsk, and
first of all, can American tourists go to Minsk easily?

Mr. Nosenko. Minsk is open city, yes. 7

Mrs. Burke. It is an open city now. Was it an open }

You know, there is one thing that is bothering me, and
that is the inconsistency and the greater detail that is present
today than in your earlier statements.

Could you give-us an explanation of why there is more de-
tail today?

For instance, in your earlier statements I noticed you
refer to the interpreter as a tourist, the tourist guide, as

seem to-me that this guy has already indicated just by that act

you decide then that you are going to accept him because you
are worried that it might cause some embarrassment after Camp

in Russian. So you knew he spoke Russian at that time. And yet!
that was one of your criteria.

Me Nogenkol, :Wéll,. ‘sir‘++.> Panere

Mr. Sawyer. Something else I am a little curious about.
Apparently, coming here, wanting to defect, ‘wanting to leave
America, wanting Russia, here is a guy that if he didn't
know anything would be apparently capable of going back to the
United States at the behest of KGB in areas of the country that!
Russian diplomats and so forth, KGB people weren't: allowed to gp
and dig up information for. them and come back. Here is a guy
you didn't have to threaten, he volunteers. And it seems stranye
you wouldn't talk to him or be interested in him just from that
point of view.

And how -- and another thing that greatly bothers me,
how did you know that he, being in the Marines, you knew that,
but how did you know he wasn't a cryptographer or how did
you know he wasn't stationed in the Office of the Joint Chiefs

'

of Staff as a guard or as a messenger or a clerk, or that he
worked with U-2s, which apparently he did. Why would the KGB
not at least find these things out, with a guy that- wants to i
go to Russia, wants to be a Russian?

Mr. Nosenko. Sir, I only can repeat you, when on him was |

received the first information about his arrival, checkup was |

made on him. There wasn't any existing material in KGB, any

knowledge about him. He never was before in the Soviet Union.

In judging by the question --

Mr. Sawyer. Why weren't they asking, why wouldn't they

ask, that's the question. Why wouldn't they ask?

Mr. Nosenko. They are not --

Mr. Sawyer. Apparently they knew he could speak Russian.

Mr. Nosenko. -- asking Americans approaching.

Judging by the questionnaire, they decided, the KGB decide

Seventh Department, he is not an “interesting target.

Mr. Sawyer. Well, why would a person like this not even

be interesting for something like the Tokyo Rose, on some kind

of propaganda program where he could say how bad things were
in the United States, and why he didn't want to stay theres
anymore and how great they were in Russia, like these

propagandists do?

Mr. WNosenko. Sir, I am telling you why it was decided,

and how KGB was thinking about him.

Mr. Sawyer. I yield back the balance of my time.

Did you conduct in the KGB a program to compromise and

Mr. Nosenko. I was working, when I started to work in the
KGB in 1953, the first year I was working against American
correspondents.

Mr. Edgar. But the KGB, not you personally, but the KGB
aid have a policy of going against. journalists and trying to
compromise them, yes or no?’

Mr. Nosenko. ‘Trying to recruit or compromise them.

Mr. Edgar. Did they censor all the journalists' notes
that they could gather from the journalists? Did they censor
the notes before they allowed the story to go out?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.

Mr. Edgar. Priscilla Johnson interviewed Oswald on the
15th of November, 1959. Would the KGB have looked at her
notes from that interview?

Mr. Nosenko. Sir, they -we censored not by the KGB, but
there is special -- it is government organization was censoring
this. Some materials are coming to the KGB, some are not
