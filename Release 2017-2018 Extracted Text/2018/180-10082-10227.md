MEMORANDUM - February 28, 1978

FROM:

Robert Blakey

Fonzi & Gonzales

RE:

Interview Delfin J. Campana (Team 3- Issue B)

Background: Reference was made to Delfin Campana by

Ross Crozier, former ClA case officer assigned

to

the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE).

Crozier said Campana was

an

employee of the ClA and

worked

as a

"singleton," that is, not a case officer

handling Cuban groups but an individual given a

variety of assignments.

It was

suggested that he might

possibly have knowledge relative to the identity of

Maurice Bishop and information concerning the alleged

association

of Oswald with Miami Cuban groups.

Details: Campana

said his association with the U.s.

government began in Cuba in the mid1950s when he

became a member of the Buro de Represson Anti-Communista

de Cuba (BRAC), an

organization which, he said, was

formed by the

American Embassy in Cuba and trained by

the FBl there. (The

name of the FBl agent he recalls was

Nacho Caranza (phon.)

As such, he was involved

in

anti-Batista operations in support of Fidel Castro.

Campana said he knew Castro personally as

result

of

having

been

close to the

family of Castro's wife.

Campana said he regularly reported to the ClA in Havana

to keep the Agency current on his anti-Batista activities.

His contact was

Among the operations he

informed the ClA about prior to conducting

became known as one of the most significant of Castro's

military victories,

the capturing of a large train load

and ammunition between Havana

and Santa

That seizure was supposed to

have been coordinated with

a political uprising and declaration of independence

eastern half of the:island,

with Carlos Prio appearing in Santa Clara

That, he said, would have

forestalled

Castro from eventually taking control.

Associated

with him in the capture of the arms train, said

Campana, was ansindividual known

as "Diego."

Campana

confirmed that Diego's true name was Victor Paneque.

He believes Paneque is now in the Miami area and said

he would be willing to help locate him.

Campana said

that his later anti-Castro activities

consisted of

involvement with the triple A organizatior

(working with Sanchez Arango, Tony de

Verona and Tons

Santiago), and of masterminding the escape of key

anti-Castro leaders on

an individual basis.

He was

able to do this, he said, through his contacts on

the ship,

Rio Escondito,

which was later involved in

the Bay of Pigs operation. Finally, in July, 1960,

after having

been

informed that Castro had become

aware of his activities, Campana himself fled Cuba

aboard the same ship.

Campana

first

landed in

Jacksonville when

he escaped

from Cuba.

There he was

immediately greeted and

debriet by an

FBI agent

whose

name he doesn't recall

but describes

him

as being of

average height, well-built,

and having red hair and reddish complexion.

This FBI

agent took him to Miami

and

had him report to the

Immigration and Naturalization Service and tell the

fabricated story that he

arrived on a boat through

Key

West.

Campana said he was then

introduced to an agent of the

CIA

whom

he knew only

aS

"Bob."

This "Bob" told him he

wanted him to relax in Miami for a couple of months before

beginning operations for the ClA.

"Bob" invited him to

his home in the southwest section of Dade County, a very

large house on

Le Jeune Road, a number of times

for dinner.

"Bob" was married and then had two children. He was próvided

with cars

and a chauffer by the ClA,

said Campana, who

described him as having thin, light-brown

hair, brown eyes

and a wide forehead.

Eventually, said Campana,

"Bob"

introduced him

to Doug

Gupton, the cover name of the individual handling

propaganda operations at the JM/WAVE station.

Campana

said he worked with Gupton on propaganda programs for

the Bay of Pigs operation.

Among the other ClA agents he worked with was Roberto Espin,

who worked under Gupton

charge of Radio

Swan. Both he

and Espin were, at one time, both involved in dispersing

ClA funds to Agency operatives on a monthly basis.

He

would, for instance, said Campana, be given

perhaps $80,000

in cash in a bag and distribute it as

payroll to Cubans

involved

in anti-Castro activity in Miami. He said he

recently told Espin that now he thinks they were the only

TWO

"stupid Cubans."

Neither of them, he said, stole a

penny of Agency money.

tarly in 1962, said Campana,

he was asked by the Agency

to go to the

Dominican Republic and prepare a

report

on the possibilities of Fallado becoming president there.

The station chief there, said Campana, had been submitting

reports on the liklihood of

that.

Campana said that

after he

investigated the situation he reported that

Juan Bosch would become president and take an anti-u.s.

posture.

That later came to pass.

He said he doesn't

remember the name of the station

chief, only that he was

a young,

German

fellow.

At any rate, he said, when ne

returned to the United States he was given a routine

lie detector test about his activities in the Dominican

Republic.

After that, he said,

he was

not given

any

more ClA assignments.

He said

he was never told the

reason for it.

"'| was

mad as hell because

I was always

faithful to the Agency," he said.

His activities on

behalf of the Agency were terminated in 1962.

Other information related by Campana:

_Following

the assassination of President Kennedy, he was

never questioned by the FBl or the ClA in relation to

either his

own activities or those of Cuban groups with

which he was

associated.

- A good person

to speak with concerning ClA-Cuban activities

in Miami would be Gus Villodo, a

friend of Alfredo

Duran's. Villodo, said Campana, "was a very active member

of the ClA."

-He knows Frank Fiorini Sturgis but never worked closely

with him in anti-Castro activities.

He said Tony Santiago

knows

him very well and he will provide an introduction

to Santiago.

-he is a very close triend of Rolando barcia, who was also

ery active with the ClA and is now chief of security for

the Venezuelan secret police.

-He never worked with Eugenio Martinez but saw

him once

operating a ClA boat in

the Florida Keys.

-He has only this information about ClA agent David Morales

aka "El Indio":

When his good friend

and anti-Castro

Teader

plinio Prieto was captured by Castro, he arranged for his

wife and children

escape to Miami

and be put up in a

motel. Campana said Morales showed up at the motel and

attempted to

have an

affair with Prieto's wife. Campana

said

4.

at one point he was looking for Morales with a gun in

order to shoot him.

-Campana said he had no association with any activities

originating in the New Orleans area.

-Campana said he was told but has no specific information

about the fact that oswald was not only in Miami at

one point but actually went to Cuba for a conference

with Castro.

He said he feels personally that castro

did not directly order Oswald to kill

President Kennedy

but may have subtly

planted the seed in his mind. He

says he has no specific evidence for that theory, only

his personal knowledge of Castro's character.

provide no information about the true identity

of Maurice Bishop or any possible

leads because,

he was never involved with Aloha 66 or Antonio

Veciana.
