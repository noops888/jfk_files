the various unofficial estimates which we have been

which are worth reporting;

Our delogram no. 456 pi Juse 19 mentioned unfovourable

references in

Chotrols apeech mode. at Cardenas on June 18

to the use of small. istande around Cuba obviously the

Balonmas were meant - for illicit counter-zevolutionary

activities.

In onbaoquent conversation with the Ambassador

Fidel Castro clained that ho

(our telegram no. 469) or the orcitonent of the momont and

sometimes carried. away

that he did not intend any attack on Britain.

2.

As you will soo fron or tolomam no. 456, the references

in the specch to Fronce were rather more pointed.

Iho Fronch

Chargé d' Affaires told un that he made a protest to the

Cuben Government about these remarko, which we believe to be

based on countor-revolutionary. claims

originating in litani

that, even

if the Americans and the British rofused to allow

their territory

to be used to liberate Cuba

other more

Irionaly countries would. The Ironch Charge d'Affairco confirmod

that there was no fronch tercitory closer than dartinigue

and Guadeloupe no that the French would not countenance te

use of these iclonds, evon it this vere prncticaule.

We did not think Castrolo semarks unduly offensive

and did not, therefore,

propose to protest.

therefore, no question of liaising with the French.

Frencl Imbaasy did not tell us in advance of their

intentions.

We do not now whether they had

instructions fron France

or decided to take action on thoir own initiative.
