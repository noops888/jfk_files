From a confidential source it was ascertained that in
April 1960 ANGELO BRUNO claimed he had been able to recover most
of his investment in an undisclosed gambling casino in Cuba, but
had difficulty in removing the money from Cuba. From an additional
source, BRUNO later stated that he had been able to get this money
out of Cuba and designated the sum he received as $180,000 for the
damage done to the gambling casino, He indicated that he was
surprised that an unknown individual had refused to accept a
$20,000 offer for making this settlement even though the settlement
was made at a time, when the insurance premiums, had lapsed.

JOSEPHSTASSI is also known as JOE/J}ROGERS..

It was requested that an additional inquiry
be made by the Legal Attache, London, in recontact
with their source to ascertain.if ANGELO BRUNO possibly
held other insurance besides that tesulting in the $185,000
claim being paid 4/59, $70,000 of which was reinsured by
Lloyds of London, @)

7 Extensive inquiry in this regard has developed
that there was a $185,000 payment made by the American
International Insurance Company, #258 Havana Street,
Havana, Cuba, As set forth herein, this policy was
No. 303-806-F. [However, the point of inquiry to Legal.
Attache, London,. should be to establish if ANGELO BRUNO
was the recipient of this $185,000 payment, less adjust-
ments, or if JOSEPH STASSI.was recipient of this payment
considering that Legal Attache, London, prior communication
on 4/27/61 relates that Col, CUMMING had advised that the
subject had received the $185,000 payment ](S)

fe is requested that the Legal Attache, London,
clarify whether BRUNO or STASSI received the money and
any additional information available that could possibly
be developed further in the United States which could
ultimately prove to be of evidentiary value against
ANGELO BRUNO. ¥@¥t should be noted that BRUNO has been
designated by” the Bureau as the target of "early

‘ prosecution" under, the Criminal Intelligence Program :

and therefore is the subject of concentrated Bureau
