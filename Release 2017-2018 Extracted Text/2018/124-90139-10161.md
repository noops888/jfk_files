Be alert for possible conflict of interest between

Bureau and CIA and,

During contacts with PSI, endeavor to determine,

without revealing the above CIA information, whether he is in

contact with any other agency. In this connection,

PSI has

been connected with MRP which was of operational interest to

CIAO

It is possible PsI,

in his activity for the uRP, was

actually doing work for CIA without knowing it since

CIA

frequently operated in organizations, such as uRP, through

cutouts.
