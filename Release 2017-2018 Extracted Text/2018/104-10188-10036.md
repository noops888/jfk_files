PROJECT LIFSAT

PROJECT REVIE

I. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Coverage

Project LIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet official

Installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Project LIENVOY

assumed this responsibility. This freed LIFEAT to provide, with 1ts

coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which

could better support not only the Station's CE effort bus alse other

Statior. operations against the Soviet target.

In this effort, LIFEAT

covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence

Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Samples

of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follows:

HMM-6479, 15 June 1962 (Mexican Winners of Sovies Scholarships

to Patrice Lamumba University)

HIMA -19826, 21 September 1962 (Transmittal of LIFEA? Report -

Vladilan I, SAMPHIN)

SOKOLOVSKAYA)

HMMA-19996, 12 October 1962 (Sovlet Personnel Assigned to Mexieo

City)

B. LIFEAT has remained a primary. source on this target throughout the

past project year.

Further, LIFEAT Information 1s considered a

MItful source of operational leads by the responsible Case Officer.

Selected examples of the valuable intelligence product derived fro

the Pollah coverage are:

C. Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yusoslav official Installation in Mexico City

has provided

a wealth of information on the contacts, aotivities, and

travel of members of that nission.

Since the Station's effort against

D. Cuban Coverage

During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuban target was

directed toward

the support of KUBARK operations in this

flold and was

not designed to provide positive intelligence.

LILEAT covered a total

of 10 lines in direct support of operations in this fleld.

Most of

the product of

this ares of operation was forwarded by cable to JiWAVE

and Headquarters, Examples of pouch communications in this fleld are

E. American Coumunist Group In Maxico (ACGM).

As noted in past project reviers, most of the targets in this group

have been covered at the request of OutiNY, and the raw take has been

processed by them. Vuring the period July 1962 through May 1963

approximately 390 reels of take vere passed to the local ODENVY for

their processing.

On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This

office feels the coverage mentloned 1s quite valuable and many userul

leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to

travel in and out of Mexico of Anerican Communists who are in contact

wilüh individuals on whon coverage is maintained".

Typical examples

of reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of tha ACGM are:

HXW-1922, 10 Ausust 1962 (Albert MALiZ, Noah SEBORER, Charles

HMMA-19678, 24 August 1962 (Albert NALTZ-Margaret MALTZ)

HNMA-21299, 7 May 1963 (Charlos SMALl and Noah SEBORER)

F. Exile and Revolutionary Activitles

During the pust year this area of activity, in addition to the already

noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of the

InFEAT effort.

Most of the Information provided by LIFEAT in 1t3

coverage of targets in this area mas not avallable from other sources.

hhile Coverage has been provided on Spanisi Republican, Guatemalan,

Costa Rican, and Nicaraguan exiles, the bulk of this produot has

resulted from the coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo and various of

his acquaintances, the "take" being forwarded to Headquarters and Station

Guatemala by elther weekly cable sumaries or irmediate action cables

when warranted It is noted that the coverage has been most rewarding

G. Counter-Intelligence Information

Mexico City Station's Related Mission Directive places greatest

emphasis on operations in the CI/CE area.

LIFEAT was able to provide

& continuing worthwhile contribution in

the attainment of the Station's

objectlves in this field.

Coverage Included that on AEGENERATE, Carlos

Humbert ILIESCAS (who acts in the capacity as covert liaison link

between the CP and the Soviet Embassy), and a PCM safe house.

In

addition to the continuing operational support in the CI/CE ileld, the

following informational reporting was provided.

HMM-6625, 10 August 1962 (Soviet Scholarship for the Daughter of

David Alfaro Siqueiros,

H. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

puring the past project year lifeat continued actively supportinz the

operations of lexico City Station through the production of leads and

only through the use of al

_ telephone tap operation. Indead,

1t 1s in this area, secure support to the Station's operations, that

LIFEAT 1s of greatest and linique value to the Station.

The following

1s a list of selected contributions by LIFEAT of operational support

and leads provided to the various Station Case Officers and Station

operations as a whole:

The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station

the home of a known Sovie: I:ellleonce officer stationed in Mexico

of both the family of the Seriet officor and his maid.

This infor-

mation nado possible the seiiing of a time for the situal entry into

the target, and continuing corerajo (Ineluding live monitoring of the

target line immediately preceding the operation) by LIFEAT sade

tap operation.

Further LIFEAT coverage has, in addition to giving information on

the dally actluities and corners of soviet ofticinis, provided an ex

-. cellent check on the contaces of three KUßARK controlled doublo agenta

with their Sovlet Case Offleers. This coverage has enabled the prepor

sible Case Officer to suide his operations with Increased assurance

that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control.

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activiiies in this area were concerned primarily

with support to the ANSTRUT operation.

Coverage of relatives of

AYSTRUT-2 provided an excellen: "indow" Inio the operation which

enabled the responsible Case Ofilcers to nove with more certainty

and security in developingel's operation.

The Case Officers Involved

considered the LIFEAT coverere an essential check on the activities of

Initial stages of the opera lon.

ation, sufficient early warning was Elven by LIVEAT so that the

operation could save been carried out. Another example of this

tyre of lead mae the data avallable from LItrAT coveraço that a

new location maz being sought for the Y'goslav Embassy, and which

apeciflo iocations were under consideration. Armed with tile Informa-

tion the Station his heen able to malo a technioal casing of one of

the prospective sites and obtain Information nocessary for entry into

the other sites.

LIFEAT/Exllo: As noted previously, LIVIAT coverago of the exilo

As noted ill paragraph I. E. above, the local office of ODENVY

considers this coversee

"quite valuable".

As also nolod in previous

clans and provides sreater seourity for long term asseta who may have

been in contadt with now terminsted agents.

H. Conclusion

It 1s the opinion of the Mexico City Station tiat the support provided

other Station operations, the chez Information and leads,

and the

ability.of the

| LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targeta

without revealing Station Interest to the liaison forces, woll justify

Che expenditure of funds, elme, personnol and socurity rink.

As 1t has

been noted in the past, that even with the Stazion's envolvecent in che

the present

could ond KUPARK partiaipation in that L

coverage, must be ivailable to once again undertake coverago of the

official Sovlet and Czech offloial targets in Mexico City.

Therefore,

LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operationa

and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive

intelligenco, leavea 11 reailly avallable for rocall into the Soviet-

Czech coverage.

It 1s the Stazion'a firm opinion that tho LIFEAT

projeot provides a subatantial and vital contribucion in tuifiinone the

several priority oujeotives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

I.

There la attached a list of the lM's produced from LITAT provided

mnierlal during to period July 1902 through May 1903, as a by-product

of lho projeat's prime reeponsibility of providing support to Station

cperations.

II. Progreas of the Operation

The objeatives of the LifeAt Project are of a continuing, nature and

are therefore not conaldered

for fulfillment during, any given period of

time.

Fer this reason percentage fleures an to completion of project

objectives canno? be draw, lowever, an Inalcation of the coverage

provided in working toward fulfillent of the objectives can be noted

In tiat approxinatoly 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the

period July liél throurt April 1903.

LISAT has been in dully opera-

c1or during the revier perlod with the average number of lines covered

per munth being 19, and a high In October 1902 of 25 lines covered.

III. Plarning for the Puture

As was indicated at the tine of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes

to remain uncommitten to coverages that require the expenditures of

a freat portion of LIPPAT resources but provide coverage of but one

target.. -nuch as Sovie% Pabassy coverage.

It 1e added emphatioally,

however, that mhould the need arise for LIFEAT to akaln assure such

respons1u11141es, 11 18 fully able to do so. Until such time LIFEAT

wili continue to enjoy treater flexibility in tho erployment of lts

assets, ergoclally in the areas in which the Station does not miah

V. Expenditures

18. Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1964. All figures

are U.S, dollars per jear (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Marican pesos).

Changes

In estimated costs for particular ltens will be noted. These reflect not

only the continued inflationary trend in the lexican econony, but also

the LIFEAT operational emphasis of support to Station operations.

In thle

letter case particular line coverage

1s of shorter duration, causing

greater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and crosses and

frequent shifting of basehouse sites.

In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries vas

Increased somewhat (due to raises granted DRABAND and ZINSMEISTER during

the past year) and reduced considerably in the field agent category (due

primarily to termination of three well paid agents. Overall funds

requested for FY 1964 total $83,800 compared to $99,000 granted for use

in FY 1963 - a reduntion of $15,192.

A greal part of this reduction was .
