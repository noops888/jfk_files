A, Soviet Coverage

Project LIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet official
installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Project LIENVOY
ts responsibility. This freed LIFEAT to provide, with its
| coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which
could better support not only the Station's CE effort but alse other
Station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT
7G covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence
: Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Sampl
of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follows:

Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav. official installation in‘Mexico City

has provided a wealth of information on the contacts, activities, and
travel of members of that mission. Since the Station's effort against
this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has: been, used extensively to provide the basic operational and

‘personality:data necessary for’ this stepped-up program, Examples of

LIFEAT produced positive intelligence and general operational informa-
tion on this target are as follows: E

Cuban Coverage .

During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuben target was
directed toward the support of KUBARK operations in this field and was
not designed to provide positive intelligence, LIFEAT covered a total
of 10 lines in direct support of operations in this field, Most of
the product of this area of operation was forwarded by cable to JHWAVE
and Headquarters, Examples of pouch corsmnications in this field are

As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this croup
have been covered at the request of QHENVY. and the raw take nas been
processed by them. During tne period July 1962 through May 1963
approximately 390 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for
their processing. On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, “This
office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to
travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are in contact
with individuals on whom coverage is maintained", Typical examples

Exile and Revolutionary Activities

During the past year this area of activity, in addition to the already
noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of the
LIFEAT effort, Most of the information provided by LIFEAT in its
coverage of targets in this area was not available from other sources.
While Coverage has been provided on Spanish Republican, Guatemalan,

Costa Rican, and Nicaraguan exiles, the bulk of this product has
resulted from the coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Rermejo and various of
his acquaintances, the "take" being forwarded to Headquarters and Station
Guatemala by either weexly cable summaries or immediate action cables
when warranted, It is noted that the coverage has been most rewarding
in the case of AREVALO and the recent coverage of

Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting the
operations of [iexico City Station through the production of leads aud
the providing of information on selected targets in the manner avatlable
only through the use of a telephone tap operation. Indesd,
it 1s in this area, secure support to’ the Station's operations, that
LIFEAT is of greatest and unique value to the Station, The following
isa list of selected contributions by LIREAT of operational support

and leads provided to the various Station Case Officers and Station
operations as a whole:



LIFEAT/Soviet: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station
efforts in this area was amiy displayed in its support of Station
assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against

the home of a Known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico
City under officiel cover, LIZEAY information provided vital infor-
mation whicn enabled: the Stavion to'establish a pattern of acticn,

of both the family of the Scviet officer and his meld. This infor-
mation wade possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into
the target, and continuing coverage (including live monitoring of the
target line immediately preceeding’ the operation) by LIFEAT made
possible # degree of security fer this operation which would not have
been possible without the support of a tap operation,
Further LIFEAT coverage has, tn addition to giving information on

the daily activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an ex=
cellent check on the contacts of three KUAARK controlled double agents
with their Soviet Case Officers, This coverage has enabled the reepon-
sible Case Officer to guide his operations with Increased assurance
that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control.

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activities in this area were concerned primarily
with support to the AMSTRUT cperation, Coverage of relatives of
AMSTRUT-2 provided an excelient “window” into the operation which
enabled the responsible Case Officers to move with more certainty

and security in developingthis operation, The Case Officers involved
considered the LIFEAT coverese an essential check on the activities of
the principals in the case which was especially valuable during the
initial stages of the operation, Travel plans of ANSTRUT-2 provided
by LIFEAT were also essential to the timing of the operation, Also
in the Cuban area LIFEAT coverage of G-2 agent enabled the Station’

to gain an insight inte his contacts and activities, Further, recent
initiation of coverage of a Cutan Commeroial Official gives evidence
of producing solid information of ecumercial transactions and Mexican
Commeratal contacts of the Cuban Government,

LIFEAT/Polish: LIFEAT continzed its coverage in the ATKNAVE/SECHICK
operation, (See previous prefect renewal for background of this case
and the LIFEAT participation in it.) Of great interest to this operation
was LIFEAT information indfeatirs that the wife of [EXKAVE had become
aware of his interest in another moman, and later revelation of reassim-
ment end travel plans of SEXRAYE. :



LIVFAT/Yugoslav: In addition to the usual information concerning
the Yugoslav officials and their daily contacts and aotivitt :
LIFEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operation:
Onn example wae a lead-w:ic:. revealed that a diplomatic courier

would be travelling alone and taking a new travel route while
carrying an official pouch, With this early waming, the Station

waz able to plan an operation to provide access to this corresyon-
denice, .Althours: Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-
‘ation, gufficient early warming was given by LIFEAT so that the
opezation could wave been carried out, Another exarple of this

type of lead was the data available from LIHAT coverage that a

new location waz being sought for the Yugoslav Enbasay, and which
syecifio iocations were under consideration, Armed with this informa-
tion the Station hs heen able to make a technical easing of one of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into

the other eltes,

LIFEAT/Exile1 As noted previously, LIFEAT covorago of thw exile
activities was the single major effort by LIFEAT during the project
year, In particular, LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo,
which Included lengtay periods of "Livo-monttoring™, on oocasion
calied for coverage of five lines, Cabled summaries of LIFEAT
information were provided Headquarters and Station Guatemala, It

1s believed that the trportence of this LIFEAT coverage onn not be
stressed too much, LIFEAT Coverage of a Costa Rican Communist exile
reeident in Kexico City has lead to a wealth of operational Leads

to reveal trmediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on
tna itfe of an LYE official by one group of the Republican Exiles,
Ultizetely, LIFEAT revealed the departure from Mextoo of two of the
ringleaders in tre plot.

LIFEAT/CI/CE1 At Headquarters request LIFEAT SopeEAES was established
on @ former SMOTH agent whose past actions gava/for some suspicion of
his present aczivities, Product from this line has revealed an effort
by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the senior ClACID
official ‘in Mexico, Early warning by LIFEAT has made possible the
preperation of counter action (see HYMA-21764), LIFEAT has also
provided coverage of a suspected RIS support agent, This coverage
had provided the background sacerial necessary for checking on the
activities of this suspect agent, Continuing LIFEAT reporting on the
Awerican Communist Group in.Nextco (ACGN) has provided ODENVY:with
great quantities of information on aolivities of leftist friends of

of the ACOM including their travel plans to México and in some cages
Cuba. As noted iu paragraph I, E. woove, the local office of ODENVY
considers this coverage “quite valuable". As also noted in. previous
renewals; LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check
cn‘active and former agents increases the security of present opera-
tions and provides greater security for long term assets who may have
been in contact with now terminated agents,

H, Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support: provided
other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the
ability of the LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets
without revealing Ton interest to the liaison forces, well Justify
the expenditure of funds, time, personnel and security risk, As it has
been noted_in the past, that even with the Station's envolvesent in the
parallel, ILIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by

the present or a change_in
could ond KUEARK participation in that project.

For. that reason, LIFEAT,. in addition. to maintaining’ its present heavy
coverage, mist be available to once again undertake coverage of the
offictal Soviet and Czech official targets in Nextco City, ‘Therefore,
LIFFAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations
and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive
tntelligenco, leavon tt readily available for recall into the Soviet-
Czech coverage, It 18 the Station's firm optnion that the LIFEAT

project provides « substantial and vital contribution in fuifilment the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive,

I, There 1a attached a list of the IMs produced from LIPFAT provided
raterial during the period July 1962 throuyh May 1963, a8 a by-product
of the project's prime reeponsidility of providing support to Station
cperations,

II, Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and
are therefore not considered for fulfillment during, any given period of
time, For this reason percentage figures as +o completion of project
ovjectives cannot be drawn, However, an inatcation of the coverage
provided tn working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted
in that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
pertod July 1261 through April 19 LISEAT has been in daily opera-
tion during the review pertod with the average number of Lines covered
per month being 19, and a high in October 1362 of 2 lines covered,



AIZ, Planning for the Puture

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
: ‘to Remain ‘uAcommitte1 to coverages that require the expenditures’ of
Ee aie .  & great portion of LIFZAT resources but provide coverage of but one
target...much as Soviet Embassy coverage, It ie added emphatically,
however, that should the need arise for LIFFAT to avain assume such
Fesponsibilities, it 1 fully able to do 80, Unt{l such time LIFEAT
wili continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the exployment of ite
assets, ecyectally in the areas in which the Station does not wish
to reveal

Vv, Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for
FY 196% in the arwmt of 249,000.00, The proposed budget for FY 1964
ta broken down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request,
Part II, and totals%3,%3,

VI, Status of Commitments

There are no comiteents other than those noted In the project outline
submitted herewith and in the individual contracts and oral agreements
(memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the
various LIFEAT pereonnel.



Even with the operational exphasis of the LIFEAT Project being
on Station operational support, it is thought sienificant to
Anelude a List of HHM's produced through ‘Nay 1963 (approximately

PROJECT LIFEAT
' "PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

1, Area of Operations

‘This operation 1s run from Mexico City Station and is concemed with targets
located within Mexico City,

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, datly information
on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel
thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected tritviduals and
groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests. Presently,
LIFEAT stresses flexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and
CIACE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis,

3. Background

Project LIFEAT was originated on 3 October 1950 as a telephone tap
te operation....Actual- initiation of: operations under this authority occurred

on 18 January 1951, and the operation has run continuously froa the'date,

The project was opened with the installation of a single tap and has grown

in the past eleven years to covarage of as many as thirty lines in 5 given

ponth,

‘The LIFEAT Project 1s a operation oucpletely intependent from any
arrangenent, It ta staffed by KUDARK contract employees with the
sajority of personnel being indigenous controlled agents,

During the past twelve years, Project LIFFAT has produced gore than 97,000
(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support
of Mexicc City Station's specific objectives, and contrituted satertally to
the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet-Satellite
Bloo and core recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition,
LIFEAT has been of cunsiderable value tn sonttering the activities of the
American Cocmunist Group in Mexico (ACGH), as well as the activities of the
exile groups and local Conmnista,

With the LIEWOY's assumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovakian
official installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continnous
coverara of these two targets, These assets were then employed in direct
support of Station operations--a role ideally suited for a[_____Joperation
such as LIFEAT, and extremely important to the security and ruccess of Station
operations.

technical operation targeted eyainst the official LIFRODE mission in.
Mexico City, LIFEUD=22 and 23 were to have béen the basehousekeepers
for thia operation. When it was found that the MKTRAP operation could
not be.routed to this basehouse because of teclinical considerations,
the base was employed as a photosurveillance base targeted against
the LIERODE mission, Since this operation is not connected with
LIFFAT operations or personnel, these two agents will no longer
be carried under the LIFEAT project.

for une as an altertiate LIFFAT basehousekeeper, However, due to o
change of plans envolving agents‘'s availability for LIFEAT work,
she was never recruited and this clearance was cancelled on 25

January 1963.

Operational Clearances

See Section 9 above,

Cover

There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously

employed in the LIFEAT operation, With the new agents employed since the |
last project renewal, cover is aa follows:

@, LIFEUD-24 has natural cover of manger of a small profitable
“medicine distributorship in Mexico City, Subject's office
hours and activities are therefore not scrutinized by a superior

and subject can devote the necessary time to his LIFEAT duties and cover

his LIFEAT salary without difficulty.

>, LIFEUD-26 has natural cover of housewife (wife of LIFFUD-24) and
mother, She performs ber LIFFAT duties only in her home (LIFEAT
ANNEX VI).

¢, LIFEUD-25 has natural cover of the wife of a retired businessman
(LIFEUD-4), A veview of LIFEAT personnel files during the past
year revealed she hai been included on her husband's clearance
request in 1953 but had never been granted clearance in “her
ow right", This was corrected when on 3 January 1963 LIFEUD-25
was granted a full CA,

‘the responsibile Case Officer and are updated as necessary,

Telephone contact concerning the projeot and with the ggente is kept to a
minimum, Pre-arranged open code is ysed for phone conversations between
Case Officers and agents,

‘These systems of contact and commnfcation appear suitable for the project
and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints. Locations
and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequently to
decrease the possibility of arousing the suspictons of the residents of areas
in which meetings are held.

Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: ideology and
financial gain, A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the local
police should discovery occur,

Security

During the past projéct year there were no incidents which were beyond the
capability of the personnel immediately involved to isolate and remedy
immediately, In contrast to previous years, there.was no instance of
teleptione work crews approaching a basehouse to ¢! remove the tap
lines running to that basehouse, Some of the made in the telephone

danger to the ‘operation unless a full “investigation ts made of one of

these unusual connections, During the past project year no such investigation
has been undertaken, and no suspicion of the LIVEAT linenen has been revealed

to date,

‘The greatest dangérs faced by LIFEAT in the past year centered on two
developments: 1) the continued efforts of the telephone company toward moderni-
zation of the Mexico City telephone system and 2) the investigation lainched by
the Secretaria ¢e Comunicaciones y Obras Publicas (SCOP) to determine if the
telephone company has not been providing maximum possible service to Mexico

City residents by holding from use certain "spare pairs” of every cable and

aistribution box:

In the first development (which has been in-process for thé past few yeara ~
and was so noted tri pact project renewals) the most noteafle incidents which
effect LIFEAT security are the installation of new underground cables re-
placing the old overhead telephone wires (thereby reducing accens to target
lines and tap routing Lines) and the institution of a more efficient aysten
to keep track of daily assignments of (thereby

A number of ideas have been tried to bypass this problem but
as yet no natisfactory solution has been found. LIFEAT personnel are continuing
their attempts to negate this problem, too, ,

As to the SCOP investigation, which 1s presently being pursued with more
vigor than is usually found in Mexican bureaucracy, the problem here is also
two-fold, First is the problem that the SCOP crews have cuthority to enter
any (and eventually all) telephone distribution box and check back on each
connection in these boxes to see if they are actually in use, On one occasion
they have rung back on a “spare pair" which was in use by LIFEAT to route a
tap to a basehouse, Although no security problem ensued it is an example

of the daily danger faced by LIFEAT in this case,

It should be noted at this point that the LIFEAT operation could “blow”

at any time’ through any ofa large nunber of security dangers LIFEAT

faces in its daily operation as a effort. _LIFEAT personnel.are.. -
trained and experienced in taking whatever action is necessary to negate

or leséen the damage as necessary, but it 16 true that there can occur @

Training

Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for
the experienced personnel are handled primarily by the “outside” case officer,
David M. WILSTED, Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and-continually reviewed with

the agents,

Equipment and Support

With the funds requested for this purpose in last approved project renewal,
LYFEAT audio and dial tape recorders were replaced during the past year,
Except for the usual problems discovered in equiprent which has been
shipped for-any distance, this new equipment has worked well since initial
use in the operation, It te believed that there will be no need to purchase
additional large amounts of special equipment for some years in the future,
provided that there 1s.no radical shift necessary in the tap techniques
presently employed in the operation.

Timetable

LIFEAT has been in continuous operation since its inception in January 1951,
and as a vital Station operational support asset,"4t.is planned to continue

it indefinitely,



- 28, Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1968, All figures
are U.S, dollars per year (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Mexican pesos), Changes *
‘in estimated costs for particular items will be noted. These reflect not
only the continued inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also

. the LIFEAT operational emphasis of support to Station operations, In this
‘latter casé.particular line coverage 1s of shorter duration, causing
greater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and crosses and
frequent shifting of basehouse sites,

In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries was
increased somewhat (due to raises granted DRAEARD and ZINSMEISTER during
the past year) and reduced considerably in thé field agent category (due
primarily to termination of three well paid agents,) Overall funds
requested for FY 1964 total $83,605 corpared to $99,000 granted for use
in FY 1963 -- a reduction of $15,192. A great part of this reduction was
possible by programing no new equipment purchases for the coming year
(see paragraph 16 above),
