alroraft are sweeping back and forth and

at that time, we also observed parked at
dockside 10. probable frog missile trans+
porters along with their support equipment,
This ship pulled in, this equipment was
apparently loaded, and moved away from the

John Seali, ABC:

Mr. Secretary, you said that certain
equipment associated with the remaining
Seviet forces has started to move out.

Can you give us some details on that and
what you think it means?
Mr. McNamara:

Yes, I don't wish to over-emphasize
this point, I don't wish to mislead you
into thinking that there are clear indica-
tions that the four Soviet combat forces
which I described as having on the order
of 1,200 men apiece, roughly 5,000 in total,
are at the present time moving out of Cuba,

But it is a fact that certain of the equip-
ment formerly assigned to those forces,
specifically certain of the rocket equipment
has been moved out of Cuba, What this
implies for the future, I can't state.

(p. 39, Special Cuba Briefing)

On 6 November 1962 low-level photography revealed five probable frog missile
transporters and two probable frog missile launchers at the Remedios Military Gamp.
On 9 November 1962, a sixth probable transporter was sighted, Based on these figures,
| plus the existence of four such major Soviet military camps, it was estimated that

from 24 to 32 frog missiles were probably in Cuba (assuming 3 or 4 missiles per
launcher), Subsequent analysis of all photography to date fails to reveal any

definitive count of frog missiles in Cuba or any indication of outshipment of
frog missiles. Therefore, the estimate of betweon 24 and 32 frog missiles

in Cuba remaing the beat figure. It ahould be noted that this is an estimate
net acount, The estimate is based upon what was sev by photography coupled
with knowledge of Soviet organization and practice.

On 26 Fecember 1962 high-level phatography revealed ten probable freg
miseile transporters on the dock at Mariel, No frog missiles or frog missile
launchers were detected, A Soviet merchant ship was simultaneously photo-
gtaphed approaching the dock at Mariel on which these transporters were
detected. Photography on 29 December 1962 revealed no frog mixzeile trans-
porters or associated equipment on the dock at Mariel but the merchant ship
had not departed. Whether the transporters were loaded aboard this vessel
and placed in the held or whether the merchant vessel unleaded additional
frog missiles which were transported by the ten teaneporters to aome other
location in Cuba, we do not know. The presumption by CLA mad the Watch
Committee wae that the transporters were loaded aboard the cad: | Apaced

APPARENT STATIC SITUATION CONTRADICTION

STATEMENTS ¢
Mr, McNamara : Me, MeCone

f
Mr, En BS ! Mr, Kendall:

.» Along with this equipment removed
from Cuba,. we estimated that 5,000 Soviet
soldiers and technicians have also depart-

‘ ed the island, Remaining in Cuba, there-
fore, are the defensive weapons systems
shown here at their deployed locations,
along with the approximately 17,000 Soviet
troops. and techni¢ians.

(p. 32 - Special Guba Briefing, 6 Ped 63)
Mr. McNamara?

In summary, then, ladies and géentle-
men, we havé recorded the entry of Soviet
offensive weapons systems into Cuba and we
have reported the introduction into Cuba

of & substantial quantity of Soviet military

personnel and Soviet military equipment,

defensive armé; Soviet military personnel

on the island, including technicians increased,

we believe, to a total of approximately
22,000 by roughly the let of November.
That total, as Mr. Hughes reported to you,

Mr. Melemara also indicated
that he considered Cuba to be a
lessening military threat since
military péople and equipment are
being moved out. I think thia is a
direct quote, “There appears to be
some continuing movement cut," This
is contrary to the faformation at least
Ihave. My information is that after
the migséiles and the IL-28s were moved
out, with the reduction that you have
indicated to 5,000 personnel there has
only been a rotation of people home
and & continuing movement in of the
supplies and spare parts and backup
ammmition for such things as SA-2.
WiLL you comment on that?

Mr. MeCone :

Yes, sir, we observed the withdrawel

of what appears to be about 5,000 men

Question: (Unidentified « Believed to be

Ann Bordone, Northern Virginia Sun)

Mr, Secretary, I gather from what you
day that in redent weeks Cuba has become
less of a military threat to the United
States than it was at the time right after
the crisis, after the missiles and the
bombers were removed, less of a threat in
the sense of, I think you aaid, 5,000
Russians had returned to the jom@land,

It 4s a lesSening threat to the United
States, from what I gather,
Secretary McNamara:

Cuba is a lessening military threat
to the extent that the military personnel
of the Soviet Union and their equipment are
being removed. As you point out, 5,000 Soviets
military personnel have moved out in the last
eight or nine weeks, and there appeara to be
some continuing movement out, What Phe future
holds, I can’t say.
(>, 50 - Special Cuba Briefing, 6 Fed 63) w

and the bombers were removed. It te
eseumed that thie personnel are the ones
that were in charge of these units and
responsible for them, and also possible

some collateral support end security

forces in connection with those particular

Weapons systems,

The removal of the troops occurred
almost concurrently with the removal
of the equipment.

Now, since then we have observed
what we feel is a relatively static
situation with, as I sald yesterday, .
with some rotation, We are continually
getting intercepts, oné as recently
as yesterday, speaking-of going home,
but we interpret this from our observa-
tion as rotational rether then a

withdrawal,

Senator Stennis:

If counsel would yield just there;
Mr, McNomara, that very point there,
about the Beoretary saying it was @ \

want you to have to pass on Mr.McNamara's
testimony,

But how could there be such a

difference in your testimony? Da you

Yea.

Senator Stennis:

Yourself?

MeCone?

Yes, we have access to the same
i facts, It is a matter of judgement,
Senator Stennis:

A matter of judgement only?

Mr, MoGone:

T have expressed by views and I
think, Mr. Chairman, you will have to
ask Me, McNamara bow he reached his
: conclusions.

Senator Stennis: |

It is highly coumendsble thet you |

1/ conflict between you.

| Mr, McCone:
None what so ever,
Senator Stennis:
I say I wes avotding the interference
in the record or even in the Comittee
i but this is a matter of judgement and
you certainly don't see any lessening of
the military strength after the with-
areal of the 5,000.
(ep. 93-95, Testinony Stennis Comittee)

FACTS:

Since the departure of thé last contingent of the IL-28 bombers and the personnel
secompanying them, we have observed no significant change in Soviet military forces in
Cuba. There hevé been some small shipments of militery-associated transport and a
munber of large crates which could contain additional coastal defense ¢ruise missiles
arriving in Cuba, However, there have been no major changes in the personnel
situation. My. MeCone’s statement. that, "We are continually getting interéepts, one
a8 recently as yesterday, speaking of going home, but we interpret this from our \
observation as rotational rather than o withdrewal," is confirmed as easentially the :
interpretation of the Intelligence commnity. On this basis we would consider the
present situation ag one of neither build-up nor reduction but rather static.

No, and I think perhaps what you have in
