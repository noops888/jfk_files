SUBJECT: Apparent Contradictions:

Mi. McNamara versus Mc. McCone

In response to your request,

attached are three separate papers

addressing the three apparent contradictions concerning FROG missiles,

the "static situation,"

and submarine bases.

Each of these papers presents in sequence the relevant statemente

or testimony with an indication of source, the facts pertinent to the

testimony as provided by DIA, and a brief conclusion. Some statements

by Mr. Hughes of DIA have been included since these statements are used

Mr. Hughes: (Briefing)

This photograph was taken of the LaBoca

Pier area (Mariel) on 27 Dec 62. Agatn our

aircraft are sweeping back and forth and

observed this Soviet ship moving into the

horbor ares from out in the ocean sector,

at that time, we also observed parked at

dockside 10 probable frog missile trans-

porters along with their support equipment.

•This ship pulled in, this equipment was

apparently loaded, and moved away from the

LaBoca area. This is one of the firet

photographs that we have firming up at least

the fact that some of the Soviet tactical

rocket forces have departed the leland,

John Scall, ABC:

Mr. Secretary, you said that certain

equipment associated with the remaining

Soviet forces has started to move out.

Can you give us some details on that and

what you think it means?

Ms. McNamara:

Yes, I don't wish to over-emphasize

this point, I don't wish to mislead you

into thinking that there are clear indica-

tions that the four Soviet combat forces

which I described as having on the order

of 1, 200 men apiece, roughly 5, 000 in total,

are at the present time moving out of Cuba.

But it is a fact that certain of the equip-

ment formerly assigned to those forces,

specifically certain of the rocket equipment

has been moved out of Cuba. What this

Implies for the future, I can't state.

(p. 39, Special Cuba Briefing)

FACTS:

On 6 November 1962 low-level photography revealed five probable frog missile

transportere and two probable frog missile launchers at the Remedios Military Canap.

On 9 November 1962, a sixth probable transporter was sighted. Based on these figures,

plus the existence of four such major Soviet military camps, it was estimated that

from 24 to 32 frog missiles were probably in Cuba (assuming 3 or 4 missiles per

launcher). Subsequent analysis of all photography to date falls to reveal any

frog missiles, Therefore, the estimate of between 24 and 32 frog miasiles

in Caba remalan the beat figure. It should be noted that this is an estimate

not a count.

The estimate in baied upon what was seen by photography coupled

with knowledge of Soviet organiaation and practice.

On 28 Fecember 1962 high-level photography revealed ten probable frog

mientle transportere on the doci at Martol. No frog mipalles or frog missile

launcheze were detected. A Soviet merchant ship was simultaneously photo-

graphed approaching the dock at Mariel on which these transporters were

dotected. Photography on 29 Docomber 196% revealed no frog minallo transe

porters or associated equipment on the dock at bariel but the merchant ship

had not departed. Whether the traneporters were loaded aboard this vessel

and placed in the hold or whether the merchant vessel unloaded additional

frog missiles which were transposted by the ten transportera to some other

lecation in Cuba, we do not know. The presumption by CIA and the Watch

Committee was that the transporters weze loaded aboard the ship.

CONCLUSIONS:

The estimate of 24 to 32 frog missilee was made on 9 November 1962 and

remains unchanges.

Me. Kendall refora to Frog Misallos being shipped out, Mr. MeCone refera

to Erod Missile Launchere presumably loaded on a ship. and Mr. McNamara refers

Vr. Secretary, I gather from what you

less of a military threat to the United

States than it was at the time right after

the crisis, after the missiles and the

bombers were removed, less of a threst in

the sense of, I think you said, 5,000

Russians had returned to the lomeland.

It is a lessening threet to the United

States, from what I father.

Secretary McNemara:

Cuba is a lessening military threat

to the extent that the military personnel

of the Soviet Union and their equipment are

being removed. As you point out, 5,000 Soviet

military personnel have moved out in the last

eight or nine weake, and there appears to be

some continuing novement out. What the future

holds, I can't say.

. 93-95, Testimony Stennis Comittee)

Since the departure of the last contingent of the IL-28 bombers and the personnel

secompanying them, we have observed no significant change in Soviet military forces in

Cuba.

There have been sone small shipments of military-associated transport and a

number of large crates which coula contain additional coastal defense cruise missiles

arriving in Cuba. However, there have been no major changes in the personnel

situation. Mr. MoCone's statenent that, 'We are continually sotting intereepts, one

as recently as yesterday, speaking of going home, but ve interpret this from our

observation as rotational rather than a withdrawal, " 1e contired as essentially the

Interpretation of the Intelligence community. On this basis we would consider the

present situation as one of neither build-up nor reduction but rather statie.

Regarding Mr. McNamera's statement concerning, "A lessening military threat,"

from the standpoint of offensive capabilities against the United States as currently

known and estimated by the Intelligence cormunity, this would be a correct statement,

with the removal of the offensive MRiMe and the Il,-28 bombers, the military threat of

Cuba vie-a-vis the United States in lese than it was prior to this action on the part

of the soviet Union. However, there 15-29

The statenent concerning "A lessening military threat" in the context of

APPARENT SUBMARINE BASE CONTRADICTION

STATELENES :

Mr. McNamara

Question: (Unidentifled Source)

Mr. Secretary, are there any sea-baged

offensive weapons of the Polarla type or

others operating in and around Cuba?

Secretary McNamare:

No, and I think perhaps what you have in

mind is that there are recurring mmore that

the Soviets have established submarine bases

on the shores of cube, bases which might pre-

sumably be used for submarines carrying

missiles. We have no evidence whatcoever

that such based have been established. As

a matter of fact, we have positive evidence

that they have not been.

(p. Il - Special Cubä Briefing, 6 Feb 63)

Mr: McCone

SECRET

We know of no submarines in the

vicinity of Cuba at the present time.

In October there were four submarines

that we hed under surveillance that

were west of the Azores, and & nother

ship ta the vicinity of the Azores

which we likewise had under survelllance.

They are building a harbor under

the cover of a flshing trawler harbor.

I have no doubt but what they will

inatall in Cuba facilitles for the

mainterance of submarines.

The soviet nuclear submarine fleet

and, its missile launching fleet is

growing, at you know, and it would be

very convenient for then to have a

place to operate out of.

Mr. Kendall:

Now, on the question of submrine

base capability in Cuba, Mr. MeNamera

vas quite euphatle that there was none

end, as I recall, it was your judgement

that the developments of such bases

was either in being or very probably

for the future.

Can you verify your podition on that?

Mx. McCone :

Yes, I think my position was thet

there appeare to be under construction

a merine base the announced purpose of

which was to service fishing trawlers and

sinilar ships but I had no doubt but

what it would and could serve as a sub-

marine servicing bose; that the existence

of such a base would be highly desirable.

However, we cannot say absolutely

that that particular base is to be a

bubmerine base.

(D. 101 - Testimony Stennis Committee)

FACTS : .

The joint Moncow-Havana ennouncement of the signing of an agreement to construct

"a fishing port" capable of handling a large nunber offishing trevlers and the

facilities for processing the catch caused considerable apprehension and speculation

within the Intelligence community as to the real purpose of thie port. It woo

epeculated that such a facility coutd be used as a base for servicing Soviet submarines

at sea, we have no evidence that thie is the intonded purpose of the fishing port.

Mr. NcCones statement that, "there appeers to be under construction a marine bade, "

is an unfortunate choice of words in that our Information indicates that construction

is due to begin in Februray 1963 and therefore the base could at best be only in the

initiol stages of construction. We have no evidence that work has actually sterted

on this construction. At the present time we are unable to deternine whether or not

the flohing port could be used as a subuarine base. At the request of DIA the Navy

has undertaken & study to determine the suitability for using this fishing port or

any other facility in Cuba as a submarine base. This stuäy should be completed

within the next week.

CONCLUSION:

There 19 no evidence that construction has started.

There ie no evidence thet the flahtng port viil be used as a submarine base.

We have not been able to determine whether the fishing port site could be used

as a submerine base. (Study has been undertaken. )
