NOTE FOR : The Director * [ec 37% 2112/8
FROM : Haviland Smith =
SUBJECT : - The HSCA Investigation of the Mexico City Station

1. The memorandum from Scott Breckinridge, attached hereto, dated
15 June, addresses only one aspect_of our problem with the HSCA. In the
fall of this year, the HSCA will prepare a report.for the Congress which will
be unclassified. There seems every likelihood that this report, whether we
are able to contest it successfully either with the Committee. or perhaps even
in the Courts, will contain sensitive information, .the revelation of which
will be very damaging to our interests..in Mexico. Not only will this report

provide evidence ‘of our: unilatera s]Jagence activity. in Mexico. C.
activities! are. against Mexican: L . npr

“mel a

Sun PORN CO ) Th

example, is their telephone tap activity, the evidence from which will be

an integral part of the HSCA's conclusions.

2. Mexico City is a focal point for. Soviet intelligence operations
against the continental United States. There is a long, documentable history
of Soviet activities based in Mexico being run into our Country. ~The relation-
ship that\we have with the Mexican ‘Security: S icesis a critical. ingredient
in.our ability to protect ourselves against. these Soviet intelligence acti-
vities. You will recall that the Boyce-Lee. case was brought to our. attention
by of the Mexican government.. If, as we suspect, the Conmittee
ublishes the kind of information spelled out above, the result on this

will.be disastrous. It will seriously weaken our
ability protect our country from Soviet intelligence activities.

3. We believe that the issues raised by Chairman Stokes in his letter
to you affords an.excel lent. opportunity. for you to underline to tim some of
the problems which are inherent in an ultimate declassification and~publica-
tion of the sensitive information they have: gleaned-from.aur files an general
intelligence activities. in.Mexico City. This may not prove to be helpful
in dampening the ardor of the HCSA staff, but it most certainly will put
them on notice that the course they are taking will have direct repercussions
not only on CIA activities in Mexico City, but on our bilateral relations
with that country.
