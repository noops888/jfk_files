NOTE FOR

FROM

SUBJECT

: The Director

: Haviland Smith

:. The HSCA Investigation of the Mexico City Station

1. The memorandum from Scott Breckinridge, attached hereto, dated

15 June, addresses only one aspect. of our problem with the HSCA.

fall of this year, the HSCA will prepare a report for the Congress which will

be unclassified.

There seems every likelihood that this report, whether we

are able to contest it successfully either with the Committee or perhaps even

in the Courts, will contain sensitive information, the revelation of which

will be very damaging to our interests in Mexico. Not only will this report

pravide evidence of our unilateral intelligence lactivity in Mexico City, which

activities are against Mexican Law, but it will also contain proof that ele

ments of the Mexican Government are involved in activities which are illegal

under their own constitution. The best example of this, but not the only

example, is their telephone tap activity, the evidence from which will be

i thermal part ot the us a onclusions.

Mexico City is a focal point for Soviet intelligence operations

against the continental United States.

There is a long, documentable history

of Soviet activities based in Mexico being run into our Country. The relation-

ship thatiwe have with the Mexican Security Service is a critical ingredient

in our ability to protect ourselves against these Soyiet intelligence acti-

vities. You will

recall that the Boyce-Lee case was brought to our attention

of the Mexican government. If, as we suspect, the Conmittee

publishes the kind of information spelled out above, the result on this

will. be disastrous.

It will seriously weaken our

ability to protect our country from Soviet intelligence activities.

3. We believe that the issues raised by Chairman Stokes in his letter

to you affords an excellent opportunity for.you to underline to him some of

the problems which are inherent in an ultimate declassification and publica-

tion of the sensitive information they have gleaned from our files on general

intelligence activities. in Nexico City.

This may not prove to be helpful

in dampening the ardor of the HCSA staff, but it most certainly will put

them on notice that the course they are taking will have direct repercussions

not only on CIA activities in Mexico City, but on our bilateral relations

with that country.
