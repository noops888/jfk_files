1. As per reference D Heddquarters concurs in this program and has offered
to forward requirements if JMIAVE so desires. Since this approval wes obtained
from Headquarters, I have taken the following steps: (A) requested and obtained
some requirements from IS to be uscd in this program and (B) through PASSAVOY
have requested some basic information as to specific facilities for use in this
program. AMBUD-1 is to advise us on the following matters: if the Hotel Monroe,
for which AMBUD receives approximitely $600 per month, has npace available for
the establishment of an interrogation center; if AMBUD.has individuals now,99 its
payroll who could be used in this program as interrogators and translavore’t tf
AMBUD-1 has, as requested, advised the group members of AMBUD to each appoint
an individual as "Jefe de Informacion" in such cases vhere one does not already

exist. -

2. My primary purposesin setting up this collection program £5/to obtain
useful information and to make AMBUD a useful organization with a purpose in mind--
@ purpose with » practical gad visible ends. AMBUD is a large organizetion couposed
of a numberogf,exayps and individuals which also has effilfates who are rot actual
members. The eee nel avaibbk to it is undoubtedly unequailed in the WAVE aréa,
From this vast reserve of manpower, there is every reason to believe competent
interrogators can be found, although most of them would naturally need training in
interrogation and reporting techniques, which factor can be surmounted. In addition
to the AMBUD personnel supply, there is also a vast, untouched number of sources im
of information in the WAVE area. For example, part of each plane load wkks of exiles
which arrives from CUba is released by Immigration; the remainder (about 2/3) are
gent to CAC, Of that number all are screened at CAC and about § are ectually
interrogated at CAC due to the lack of personnel to handle any more cases. In othex®
wmrix addition, no women arriving from Cuba are interrogated at CAC. Therefore,
the number of persons who are potential sources of information available to AMBUD
would be approximately 2/3 of all teose arriving from Cuba, plus all the women.

3. I think we should approcah this information collection program with an

aim of, ing it an aztual going concern and not a hol¢iag operation or as just
a2 ioaky Bo’ keep AMBUD busy x make them feel they are contributing to the casse.

As 2 result, I plan to make up a chart,or table of organization,of aa actual
interrogation center for this purpose, In addition, I will make an estina

oF any additonal expenses which might be involved in the near future. Since I
have had actual KUBARK ‘expdrisnee in an interrogation center, I believe Ian
at least somewhat.qualified to make certain suggestions. (FYI: inthe
KUBARK| interrogation Center created for the interrogation o
Fepatriates from the USSR, I was chief of the CE Section. In additéon, 1 trained

» several Folite Inspectors and Officers in interrogation techniques.

Also, I was head of a five-man] interrogation teem.)

4. ‘An interrogation center of the type I havé in mind, after serious consideration

“of the personnel, facilities and sources available to AMBUD, should put AMBUD on

the operational map, so to speak, and should also do credit to JMWAVE. This center’
would uot be in opposition to, or in competition with CAC, since the sources tapped
would be those they are'not physically able to handle and the women vho now ave
under no one's Jurisdiction for such matsarss purposes. 4
5. At: your conventence 1 woulg,1!ke the opportunity to discuss this program |
vith you and to also talk about the/requirenents for passing to ANBUD.
