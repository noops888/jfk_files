there {s no Senator available for that Purpose, but both you and
I are contemplating having a Senator swear you in and ask you if
your transcript is true to the best of your knowledge at some
Point as soon as possible as it can be arranged after today's

Mr. Halley. Yes. The statement that you have just made
is my understanding of the agreement that we entered into prior
to this conversation going on the record.

Mr. Baron. Thank you.

Let us‘bagin then with ‘some very‘broad questions
about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you
were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with the
IMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in
approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-

quarters. TI was Chief of Foreiqn Intelligence Activities for thb

Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from thosk

duties to conduct a survey of the opportunities for running

intelligence operations against Cuba. I was released from those|

intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations
against Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence
for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was

your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

TOP SECRET



Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

S.€,, Wasnington, 0.C. 2000

is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

I want to qualify that. Undoubtedly, there wera some
actions that were being conducted in the Eastern European area

that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Bay of Pigs

operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until

approximately February of 1962.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the Agency?

Mr, Halley. I joined the Agency originally in 1951.

Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the
nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of '62}

Mr. Halley. When I was first assiqned to the Agency, I was
an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency
training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities
where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.

I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany.‘.In the
course of that. service, I spent most of my time working on the
Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in
Soviet operations and East German operations.

Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American
affairs prior to February of '62?

Mr. Halley. Yes. In the period 1960-62, I.was ‘responsible!
for setting up operational activity in Latin America that

was targetted more explicitly on the Fastern European satellites

to some extent on the Soviet Union. This was in a period of tim

where the Eastern European satellites were expanding thétr

Presence in Latin America. In my duties in the Eastern European

Division, I was responsible for gqettina this program coing in

Latin America, so I did have an extensive exposure to Latin

America: in the period '60 to '62, as I recall those dates.

The accuracy of those dates can be chacked from ny official

travel records, and so on.

Mr. Baron.

During that period of time you were actually
in Latin America helping to set up this progran?

Mr. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but I

fravelled to Latin America during this particular period of

time.

Mr. Baron.

Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the

course of that operation?

Mr. Halley. Not specifically. I think I transitted Cuba

on air stops being routed to various countries. 1 think I was

at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.

Mr. Baron.

Not long enough even to talk to the people at

Mr. Halley. No, I had no contact at any time with the

attitude, {£ you dia?

Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad

political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was

much More narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European

targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly

specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.

Mr. Baron.

Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as Part of,

the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not.

Mr. Baron,

Coming then to February of '62, is that the
point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?

Mr. Halley. No.

When I first entered into this survey,

it was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment,

to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that

particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task

Force that was attempting to expand intelligence coverage of

Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular

point in time.

Mr. Baron.

At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completes this survey.

These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into

from my service records, but after having completed the survey

Mr. Baron. Would you assume that that was sometime before

Mr. Halley. Yes. It was probably before that, but as I
Say, there are a couple of weeks gap that we would have to look
at my service record to get the exact dates, but certainly it
could have been March, it could have been April: But I reserve,
you know, the right to check my record if that is a critical
point in terms of what you are trying to establish.

Mr. Baron. Certainly.

T should say generally at this point, if anything we cover
today gives you that kind of problem it would be immensely
helpful to us if you would check your answers against. documents
that might be available in the CIA.

Mr. Halley. Yes, all right.

Mr. Baron. In fact, let me ask you if you would check that
one out, because it would be useful to know exactly when you
joined the JMWAVE station.

During the period of time before you joined SMWAVE, while
you were conducting the survey, did you report to anyone other
than William Harvey?

Mr. Halley. In a formal sense, this TDY was conducted on
behalf of the task force commander, who was Mr. Harvey. While

Iwas in Miami conducting the survey, I obviously discussed

“survey to see what kind of activities could be conducted against

matters pertaining to that survey to the team who was then in
charge of the operational activity in Miami. That team was
essentially headed by Mr. Al Cox,,who has since died.

Mr. Baron. Was that team the equivalent of JMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. Yes.

Mr. Cox was the head, then, of what woul:
be the equivalent of the JMWAVE Station.

Mr. Baron. Was he the head of JMWAVE until the woint when

you replaced him, or until the point you became Chief of the
JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. That is correct. .He was the head of that
unit until such time as I replaced him.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware during this survey that you

were conducting of any link between Task Force W and the so-callba
Special Group in the White House which was part of the National
Security Council structure and used the project namec! MONGOOSE
for anti-Cuban operations?

Mr. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted

this survey was that there was a three-man group in existence

which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a

Cuba. The other members of that particular group were General
Lansdale and Mr. Helms.
This three-man group had subordinate to it for all practicafl

Purposes the task force unit which was managed by Mr. Harvey.

used, that is Project MONGOOSE, or whatever you said. I do not

know the exact words you used. I am not familiar with that
terminology.
Mr Baron. . During the whole Period of your involvement

with JMWAVE, you were not made aware of Project MONGOOSE as

such?

Mx. Halley. I am not aware of Project MONGOOSE. 1 do not
recall it as an acronym, eryptonym or anything else that was in
common usage in my conversations.

Also, you have to understand that during that particular
time, Mr. Harvey was subordinate to the normal Agency chain of
command. In other words, he had parallel lines, if you will.
There was this three-man Task Force to whom he was reporting
regularly. At the same time, as the Task Force Commander, he
was reporting to the then-DDP who was Mr. Helms.

Mr Baron. You began your survey just about the time that
Mr. Helms replaced Mr. Bissell as pop?
Mr. Halley. That is right.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the command relationship

Harvey as head of Task Force W? Did that group task Harvey
directly, or did Harvey's assignments have to come through Helms

and through the DCI as opposed to this group that did not includ

the DCI?

Mr, Halley. My understanding of it at the time was we were

TOP SECRET



Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

really talking about parallel lines. In other words, this
three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of
that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came back
from one of these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey
it was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two

channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task

force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr.

Helms who was the DMP.

Mr. Baron. As far as Mr. Ilarvey was concerned, an assign-
ment or order from Richard Nelms was an order to be taken’ at
face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the
stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Would that have been
your operating understanding?

Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes.
Certainly an instruction received from Mr. Helms was a valid
Agency instruction.

Mr. Baron. The DCI at this point was John McCone.

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of the relationship

‘between this three-man group and John McCone at that point?

Mr. Malley. Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to
Miami, I came back on a regular basis to review operational
plans and programs. On one occasion I accompanied Mr. McCone
to the White House to give a presentation or sit in while the

presentation was being made.

Mr. Baron. Where was this? What was the forum in which
the presentation was made.

Mr. Halley. This was a meeting with President Kennedy and
other members of ‘the then-Cabinet were present at that particular
Meeting.

Mr. Baron. Was that a Cabinet meeting or.was it a Special
Group meeting as a sub-unit of the National Security Council?

Mr. Halley. You know, that happened in 1962. This is
1975. I do not recall then with precision as to whether it was
a meeting of the Cabinet or whether it was a meeting of the
National Security Council, or whather it was a meeting of the
Special Group.

Mr. Baron. That: is perfectly understandable. Do you recalh
which Cabinet members were present at that meeting?

Mr. Halley. .Yes.. My recollection of that was that Mr.
McNamara was present, Mr. Rusk Was present, Mr. Kennedy, the
Attorney General, was present. You know, I am just vague now
at this particular point. Those are the ones that stick out in
my memory as being praesent.

Mr. Baron. Was the DCI present?

Mr. Halley. Yes, the DCI was present, and he gave a
Portion of the presentation. As I recall, Mr. FitzGerald gave
the other portion of the presentation.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that that group might have gone

Mr. Halley. No, I am not,

Mr. Baron. You are not familiar with the term Special

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of the term Special Group.

earlier, that particular time, I cannot distinguish between

whether this was an ad hoc meeting or this was a Special Group

Mr. Baron. Did you assume at that time that the three-man
group that you referred to, ‘includdng- the Attorney ‘General,
General Lansdale and Richard Helms, had a formal relationship
to this larger Special Group? In other words, was that three-

man group 4 kind of decision-making sub-unit of the Special

“Group, or do you think it operated entirely independent from

the National Security Council structure.

Mr. Malley. I do not think I can give you an authoritativel
answer to that. I would go back to what I Previously told
you. When I entered into this project in February of '62, the

chain of command that I was familiar with was this three-man

group in constant contact with Mr. Harvey. The second chain

of command, paralleling that, was Mr. Harvey reporting to the

DDP and the DDP subsequently reporting through his chain of
command to the Director, and that would be the only way that
I could characterize that with any accuracy, E

Mr. Baron. Did those two chains of command continue. .
as the channels of decision-making and tasking when you were --
or during your tenure as Chief of Station.at -JMWAVE?

Mr. Halley. That relationship changed, and again I do
not have the date at my fingertips at what time that changed.
I know that shortly thereafter I was in Miami, General
Lansdale came down to visit me, to talk with me, about the
Progress that was being made in the operational program. At
Some point after that, this three-man group for all intents
and purposes disappeared. General Lansdale was reassigned;
the group broke up; subsequent reviews of the Program were made
at the Special Group level. As an example, we would have to

submit every month the number of operations that we were going

to run, such as infiltrations into Cuba through what would be

“paramilitary means, and these were approved hy the Special

Group. There was an approval procedure for setting those up,
SO Subsequently the three-man group disappeared and the regular
mechanism of the Special Group came into play.

Iam sorry, I cannot give you a precise date for that

change, but I am sure it is in the record and I am sure you evenl

“done against Cuba. As soon as that was more or less agreed

of material for you. 1 feel that You would just have to gat
those dates for the record,

Mr. Baron. We can do that.

Would you say that every major operation that you undertook
at JMWAVE would have been approved by the Special Group or at
least they would have been put on notice of the nature of any
major operation that you were planning?

Mr. Halley. Why do you hot define for me what you consider|
to be a major operation so we do not get into, you know, a
Problem? Ifyou feek-that you Sed ee

Mr. Baron. Perhaps we can turn it around and say, could
you characterize the kinds of operations generally that you
would refer to this three-man group initially, Pg the Special
Group later, for their approval, or at least to put them on
notice,.. the kinds that you might not refer and instead proceed
unilaterally?

Mr. Halley. Initially, the three-man group was seized

with the problem of conducting the survey of what could be

upon, my understanding of this, as I told you, thr three-man
group was disbanded or atrophied or went on to other things
and then the formal mechanism came in for approval, that is,
the Special Group. as Procedures. became more formalized, we

had to submit a monthly schedule of the kind of operations that

TOP SECRET

would be conducted against Cuba in the paramilitary Fields,

In other words, if wa were going to run an operation that
was going to be a cache replacement in the Cuban mai land, that
had to be put in, say in our October schedule, that dctober
schedule had to be submitted to the Washington Headquarters so
they could make it available to the Special: Group sometima in
September. So r would regard a cache, say the lowest kind of
Operation in terms of sensitivity, and then you could’ move up

from team infiltrations that had to be approved in advance,

Fesupply missions, Paramiltary operations against fixed instal-
lations would all be approved.

Mr. Baron. If there had been any Operation with}the
assassination of Fidel Castro, or other high Cuban government
leaders as its objective, would such an operation havi been
referred to either the three-man group or later the Special
Group.

Mr. Halley. If such an operation had been Proposed. from

Miami, it would have had to have gone through that particular

Process,

Mr. Baron. Your answer seems to indicate that only
Operations that originated at the JMWAVE Station would be
referred up for approval. Is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is the kind of aetivity that I have
firsthand knowledge of. When I became the Station Chief, I told

in Cuba were plans to assassinate any number of people in Cuba.

Mr. Halley. Right, and T will stand by my answer; that is,
T put forth no plans, I know ef no plans put forth, you know,
during my tenure in Miami in which assassination was part of
the operational rationale. You know, the only way we can clarify
this perhaps to your satisfaction is to digcuss gome specifics,

with those within the framework of that general statement that
T made, you know. I know how Cubans talk. I know the rumors

one hand, the Agency chain of command from the DDP to Harvey
fo you at JMWAVE, and on the other hand, the three-man decision

Helms. Would you say in the early days that this three-man

group appeared to you to be in control of the decision making

in a less formal way than they were later under the Special
Group?

Mr. Baron. Who. briefed you on the existence of the body?

Mr. Halley. My recollection of the initial briefing was
from Mr. Harvey.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall how he described that three-man

very active for me, therefore, I do not remember with precision
that conversation in all of its details. I do recall my first

“an assassination weapon among other uses a desirable capacity?

Therefore, when we were standardizing weapons to our
paramilitary teams, things like that, weapons would be discussed
in terms of, you know, muzzle velocity, rateiof: fire, .weight ~
of the weapon for the Cuban to eaeey because many of them were
quite small. In this context, peopla would discuss what is
the range, can a guy use it to shoot somebody at a particular

for close combat?

Therefore the term assassination was just a part of the life
of the fabric at that time. That is what I am trying to get
across. I just cannot articulate any more eloquently than
that.

Mr. Baron. I think you are being quite eloquent and

In other words, was that phrase used positively?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not. It is the kind of thing
that weaves itself into, you know, a conversation.

For instance, if you are planning a commando raid against

implanting your «target and the guard stumbles on you, you know,
the guard force then becomes an immediate! risk to your operation
and usually there is a fire fight. Therefore, this becomes a

Therefore, in this context you are talking about range, you
know, one of the key factors becomes what is the accurate range
of a weapon if fired by an expert marksman. Therefore, that is
the kind of thing that would go into, you know, discussions of
weapons.

Mr. Baron. When you were discussing weapons with high
range and low muzzle velocity, was this ever discussed in the
context of shooting Fidel Castro or other key Cuban leaders as
opposed to targetted shooting on a commando raid.

Mr. Walley. I can recall, you know, no conversation in
which it was narrowly focused on the question of Fidel Castro.

“documents. You know, I am sure there is a Maxwell Taylor Reportl,

appreciated.

Mr. Halley. I think what I would like to do is to try to
put this into some perspective.

The perspective really starts with the failure of the Bay

of Pigs Operation. After the failure of the Bay of Pigs, the

Kennedy Administration wanted another look taken at the problem

of Cuba. In order to get that other look started, the Kennedy
Administration created this threa-man task force or this three-
man group and wanted to see what else could be done against
Cuba, and that is when I came into this Problem in February of
"62.

Mr. Baron. Is it possible that the three-man group that
you are referring to is actually the Robert Kennedy-Maxwell
Taylor Board of Inquiry into the reasons for the failure of the
Bay of Pigs operation?

Mr. Halley. This three-man group stemmed out of that
inquiry. What its relationship was to the inquiry, I do not kno
because I was not involved and I never had an opportunity once

I plunged into this job, to go back and read those historical

and so forth, but I have never read it.

All right.

Therefore, my first task-wherl I became involved in this
was the task of coming up with an operational plan to see what

kinds of intelligence could be collected in Cuba, so that by

collecting this intelligence, an assessment could be made based
on hard facts as to what could be done against Castro. In other
words; the difference here was that people thought that the Bay
of Pigs operation was not soundly grounded in intelligence.
Therefore, this was an attempt to start the collection of
intelligenca to sea what could be done. °

In order to collect intelligence at that particular time,
it was believed that all avenues of approach should be used,
so that meant classical foreign intelligence operations,
counterintelligence operations, the debriefing of refugees, and
the use of paramilitary means to put teama into Cuba to collect
intelligence on that part of the island that could not be
covered by what you would call the more classical means of
foreign intelligence collection.

As the program was started essentially by me or accelerated
by me, we in fact got caught up with the Cuban Missile Crisis -4
that is, the advent of the Soviet intervention into Cuba -- and
our whole effort shifted to covering that Soviet build-up in

Cuba, and this was an integral Part to our having detected the

“Soviet build-up and the United States government taking the

actions which they did, that is, to verify this.

There was a great problem for a while when we ware all

“whether there were any economic pressures that could be brought

Then we took a look again, because we knew an awful lot
more about them than we had when we started in February of ‘62,
to see what could be done against Cuba, and it was clear at
that point that no external invasion was going to be possible,
because that was something that was excluded by: the Khruschev-
Kennedy agreement and then it was not feasible. In any event,
therefore it was a question of what could be done. So we were
collecting intelligence to continue to stay on top of the
situation. We were attempting to establish contacts with the
military establishment in Cuba to see if there was any force
that was opposed to Castro within the military establishment

that would be used to alter the situation and continue to see

Primarily to the ways and means of finding a dissident group

within Cuba-that might be capable of overthrowing Castro,

number one, and number two, of finding means of undermining
the economic strength of the Castro government.

Mr. Malley. In addition, we were continuing to support
certain elements of resistance, you know, that were still there
that were not in the Army.

Mr. Baron. What kinds of elements were those?

Mr. Halley. These were paramilitary forces that were in
Cuba, that we had put in or established contact with, or People
who were already in the bush who we had already established
contact with or they had established contact with us, and we
were providing them with food, weapons dnd so forth so that they
could survive. So that it was a multifaceted approach at that

That went on from the middle of '63 until the middle of

Mr. Baron. Can we turn now to the structure of the JMWAVE
Station and explain that a bit? Iow large was the Station?
What was the command. structure within the Station?

Mr. Halley. The Station started expanding in whatever
timeframe it was, somewhere after the survey was completed. It,
must have started expanding sometime in March of 1962. You
know, by the time that it was at its peak, which was probably
somewhere just before the Cuban Missile Crisis, July, August
of 1962, it was either the largest or the second largest -- ny
recollection was that it was the second largest station in
existence at that time. I would not want to be pinned down on
a particular number of people on any particular day.

Mr. Baron. Could you give some idea as to the number of
employees at the Station during its peak?

Mr. Halley. I would say somewhere in the neighbordhood of,

questions.

Mr. Baron. Right.

Mr. Halley. Let me try to divide that and deal with each
question separately.

Let me first deal with the vessels. Every vessel that we
had was appropriately registered. There were no short-cuts:
insofar as the U.S. Coast Guard was concerned. That is, any
vessel that was registered in the United States met appropriate
safety standards and so forth, so we were not putting any
vessels into the water that any citizen could not have put into
the water. That is we are talking about ten, fifteen, twenty
foot boats, thirty foot boats, thirty-five foot boats, things
like that. These boats were owned in‘elther a. corporate-name

a rendezvous between two vessels which wera our vessels, and
this was coordinated with the Coast Guard.

Then there was the Paramilitary Branch. This was the

established contact with resistance groups. This was a group
that also worked in putting in caches that would supply people,

dealt with exiled refugee groups that were involved in radio

Mr. Baron. Why were they called L pills?

Mr. Hallev. Everything has a number or nomenclature, I
do not know.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear of poison pills to be used
in assassination operations against Fidel Castro or other
Cuban leaders?

Mr. Halley. No.

Is that referencing to this material that I might have

provided for Harvey? Because if that is the case, I can dispel

Mr. Baron. You would not have access to poison pills?

Mr. Halley. That is what I'm trying to clarify what it is
that you are trying to establish from me.

In other words, if you are Saying --

Mr. Baron. Let us move further, I think wa can be more
specific now.

We have a document that. I am about to show you. I just
wanted to clear up. the background of it before we discussed
the document.

Mr. Halley. Let me just make this point. If you are
talking about drug pills, I had no source of such things, so

if that is the nature of your question, I can say I had nothing

to do with that. If you are talking about, you know —-

Mr. Baron. Arms and equipment --
Mr. Nlalley. -- weapons or something, yes, that was in my
inventory. I could have issued that to Harvey, you know, guns,

ammunition, plastics, that kind of thing I could have had

‘access to, yes. That is why I am trying to sort out really

where the thrust of your questioning is.

Mr. Baron. There were two prongs: to the question, you
have picked both of them up. One is whether you had ever heard
of poison pills in connection with an assassination operation

against Fidel Castro, and your testimony would be that you had

Mr. Halley. That is right.~ I would not have had access

Mr. Baron. You never had any such correspondence?

Mr. Halley. I talked to Walt Elder on the phone. You know

activity. Yes, I have looked at that kind of thing. But I
have not looked at the specific IG Report. I have not read it,
I have not seen an extract of the IG Report.

Mr. Baron. Were you given any specific instructions as to
the kinds of things that, you could say or not say here today?

Mr. Halley. _ You know, nothing beyond what you and I
touched on which you have already put on the record.

Mr. Baron. Which is an excerpt from the Inspector General's

Report of 1967 at pages 49 and 50, and I will ask you to read
the portions that I will bracket which deal with a report of
a meeting between yourseif and William Mlarvey involving the
supply of arms and equipment.

(Pause) ’

Mr. Halley. I have no reason to doubt this. I may have
provided this support. I do not recall sitting in a parking lot
observing --

Mr. Baron. For the record, wa are discussing the passage
that begins, “When the pills were given to Varona through
Roselli, Varona requested arms and equipment needed for the
support of his end of the operation. Roselli passed the request
to Harvey. Harvey, with the help of (Mr. Halley], the chief
of the JMWAVE Station, procured” .---

Continuing.--And then it continues to say a large Shospine
list of arms and equipment, which cost about $5,000 and were
supplied in a parking lot of a drive-in restaurant in a rented
U-Haul truck.

Would the cost of $5,000 have been an unusual expenditure
at that time at JMWVAVE Station for arms and equipment?

Mr. Halley. No, $5,990 would not have been an unusual
expenditure.

Mr. Baron. Not unusual enough, in fact, for you to have
a particular memory of the event?

Mr. Halley. No.

Now that I read over this thing, I do recall, as I told

you earlier before you showed ma this document something about

a rented truck and being involved with Harvey in providing him
some logistical support for an activity. I do not recall this
specific list of equipment being-involved, you know, soiewhere
you got this and if I could check it against the files, if there
are any files available, I could verify whether this is correct.
or not.

Mr. Baron. Whether or not the particular list is correct,
you would say that these couple of passages from the IG Report
generally characterize youf involvement with Harvey in this
one incident correctly?

Mr. Halley. I would want to sharpen this up, because you
have one, two, two paragraphs here. In the first paragraph
there is a reference to some pills. I had nothing to do with
any pills. I have no recollection of any pills.

Mr. Baron, Let us jump then to the very last statement and
let me ask you if this confirms your own sense of your knowledge
The report says: “Harvey says that [Halley]" -~ here I
am using your alias =--"never knew to whom delivery was made nor

for what purpose. [Halley] was merely called upon to furnish
support for a headquarters operation from which he was otherwise
excluded."

Mr. Halley. I would say that is correct.
IT want to go back to these other points, though, because
IT want to be meticulously correct here. I do not recall the
specifics of this inventory of equipment. I do not recall,
you know, sitting in a parking lot, surveilling any kind of a
vehicle.: On the other hand, I do recall having been involved

that and that is the thing that has me a little perplexed here

Mr. Baron. At that time, if Harvey had made a request of
you to supply $5,000 worth of equipment like explosives,
detonators, .30 caliber rifles, .45 caliber handguns, radios
and boat radar, would you have supplied that equipment to Harvey
or to anyone he designated without asking him what the purpose
of the operation was? :
Mr. Halley. Yes, I would have supplied 4t to Harvey or
to his designated representative, depending on how that person
identified himself to me with the equipment that he requested.
That was my chain of command and, if he had told me that he
had wanted this material for any operational activity, I would
have ‘seen to it that it was issued to him. That is the way the
Agency functions.
Mr. Baron. Would it have been standard procedure in a
paramilitary operation to procure equipment that would not have
been traceable to the United States as the IG Report indicates
was done in this case?

It depends on what was the

) while Castro was scuba diving, but the problem of Castro being

of 1960 involving connections between CIA officials and people
who have been characterized as members of the Mafia, of the
gambling Syndicate who had interests in Havana and which involved
the passage of poison pills to people inside Cuba purportedly
for use against Castro in the restaurant that he frequented.
And this plot by William larvey's own admission was directed
by Harvey during ilarvey's tenure as the Chief of Task Force W.

Mr. Halley. I take due note of what you are saying. I
have no knowledge of that. I will ba glad’to comment-on any
of thé names. My commenting on names is in no way to reflect
any knowledge on my part of this particular activity, because
I have no knowledge of it.

Mr. Baron. You have already stated that you have no
knowledge of any assassination effort involving poison pills?

Mr. Halley. | Yes.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear of any assassination: schemes
which may or may not have been put into effect involving
exploding sea shells that Castro might pick up by scuba diving?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not recall any exploding sea shells
an avid scuba diver is well-known to me. As I recall, somewhere
in this thing there was a refugee group or Cuban exile group
or somebody at one timé in this whole activity who had focused
on the question of whether Fidel Castro was vulnerable at the
time that he was scuba diving.

exploding sea shells.

Mr. Baron. You do not recall ever hearing Desmond

FitzGerald mention that subject or hearing that Desmond
FitzGerald was involved in exploring that possibility, planting

an exploding sea shell?

Mr. Halley. The exploding sea shell is enough of an off-

beat kind of thing that I think I would have recalled it. I

don't recall it.

I do recall Castro's scuba diving, and that representing

a@ vulnerability and somewhere in the recesses of my memory,

that does strike a bell with me that some exile group, somebody

was talking about Fidel Castro being vulnerable while he was

scuba diving.

Mr. Baron. Did you!ever hear of a plan to present Castro
with a skin-diving suit in which Beceeeia injurious to his health
would have been cultured, bacteria that would have produced
tuberculosis and would have produced a dreadful disease?

Mr. Halley. I have never heard of any bacteria approach
to the problem of dealing with Fidel Castro.

I do want to come back to this that I do recall something
about scuba diving, you know, on the range of Fidei being
vulnerable at the time he was scuha diving, but I do not recall
exploding sea shells or bacteria.

or indirectly, of any involvement-of John Roselli in Cuban
operations?

Mr. Halley. Other than reading the papers --

Mr. Baron. Other than what you read recently in the papers
did you acquire any knowledge during your period as Chief of
Station at JMWAVE of John Roselli's involvement in Cuban
operations?

Mr. Halley. No. I had the impression from Mlarvey going
off that he was meeting with somebody, and at one point in time
I came to the impression that he was meeting a guy by the name
of John. Who John was, I had no idea. Wa were involved in an
attempt to try to find two Soviets at one point who were of

a member of one of ths casinos in Cuba at some time.

Mr. Baron. Do you remamber who that was?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not. I do not remember the man's

recollection when I was in Miami, Santos Trafficante was in the

I also think that there was soma large scandal, when I was
in Miami, that was played up in the Press. I forget, some
Federal agent who was somehow involved with the Mafia and with
the Syndicate and there was some*linkage in the Press between
Santos Trafficante, Cubans and the Federal agent;,.but I do not

Roselli that you had no knowledge of his connection with any
CIA sponsored operation against the Cuban government or against
Castro personally?

Mr. Halley. At the time that I was there -- you know, I
want to caution you that I have read the Press. If I have
trouble sorting this out, I want you to understand that --

Mr. Baron. I understand that clearly.

Mr. Halley. -- that this is a dilemma for me. Obviously
I told you I made my own deduction that John, the one that
Harvey was in touch with, must have turned out in. the context of
20/15 hindsight to be John Roselli. At the time, I did not
know that.

Mr, Baron. The same question for Sam Giancana.

Mr. Halley. Again, I say in answer that at the time that
I was involved in '62 and '65 I did not know anything about
Sam Giancana. I have since read in the Press about him.
Therefore, the name is familiar to me today.

Mr. Baron. Did you know at that time that Sheffield
Edwards, who was then Director of the Office of Security, was
connected in any way. with those efforts against Castro personall
or against the Castro government?

Mr. Halley. At that time, Shef Edwards was known to me
as Director of Security. That is all. I had no knowledge of
his involvement in any activity against Fidel Castro in a
personal sense.

Shef Edwards did help Security Officers assigned to my
staff in Miami. Therefore I would periodically go to him about
the performance of his officers who were on my staff. So during

in the early stages of an assassination plot against Castro

Mr. Baron. One more nama that wa already discussed, that
is Tony Varona.
Mr. Halley. Yes.

Mr. Baron. You said that you did know Tony Varona?

Mr. Halley. I know of Tony Varona, that he was leader of
the consejo, the revolutionary counsel that had been set up to
sort of administer the Bay of Pigs operation. In the post
Bay of Pigs era, Nua Cardona and Tony Varona were people who
still appeared on the exile seene and were prominent. We had
some dealings with Nua Cardona, officers in the Station had
dealings with Nua Cardona and Tony. Varona to pay off, you know,
injuries to peopoe who had been suffered during the Bay of Pigs,
I know who he is and so
forth, the name is very familiar to me. I never personally met
with Tony Varona.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that William Harvey had an
independent line of communication with Tony Varona?
I am not.

Mr, Halley. No,

Mr. Baron. Would it surprise you if that were the case?
Mr. Halley. The Tony Varona thing would surprise me,
frankly. I think I would not -- I would be surprised, yes.

Mr. Baron. Why is that?

Mr.

Halley. Wall, because here is a-case where the guy
was a prominent exile figure, essentially residing in Miami, and
I knew of no contacts or had “no reasons to suspect any contacts
with this kind of an exile figure, though once it specifically
appeared, I was aware of and it was discussed. This was done
under FitzGerald's stewardship with the Task Force. I was
aware of that. I would be surprised if somuone was in touch
with Tony Varona and I did not know about it. If you told me
that is what happened, that is what Harvey has testified to,
I accept that. I am surprised by it.

Mr. Baron. What was the nature of the CIA relationship
to Artime?

Mr. Halley. Well, the Miami Station had no direct: relation
ship with him. As to the nature of the project, you know Artime'

ran‘from the Agency, from other people who actually worked with

‘him on a first time basis.

Mr. Baron, Were you aware of a project called AMLASH?

Mr. Halley. Let me make sure we are talking about the same
thing.

Mr. Baron. We have just gone off the record to straighten’
out the fact that we are both talking about the same Cuban’ high
military officer who was known to the CIA by the eryptonym of
AMLASH.

Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Halley, that you and I agree
that we are referring to the same person that we have identified
off the record?

Mr. Halley. Yes, we have.
Mr. Baron. Were you aware of contacts between AMLASH-1,
as he was known, and Artime?

Mr. Halley. I think at the time that this was going on, I
do not know whether I was or I was not. -- I was aware that the
CIA was in touch with AMLASH.

Mr. Baron. Did: you deal directly with the case officers
who ran AMLASH? :
Mr. Halley. I did not. My recollection of this AMLASH
case is as follows. .At:some point in time; I-had.a conversation
with Desmond FitzGerald in Washington during one of my periodic
visits to Washington from Miami. We discussed at that meeting

‘the nature of our approach to the military establishment in
Cuba. In the context of that conversation, Mr. FitzGerald asked
me if I thought whether it would be a good idea for him to meet
one of these Cuban military personalities, and he subsequently
identified to me the personality he was talking about was

AMLASH-1.

My advice to him was that it would probably not be & good
idea for him to meet himy and the only thing that I could see
coming out of that kind of a contact would be that he, Mr.
FitzGerald, would get a personal feel for what makes some of
these People tick, in human terms, and that that probably was
too high « prica to pay for the prospect if anything went wrong,
an individual as prominent in Washington as, both within the
Agency and the social world in Washington, would be exposed in
the Press. That would create a flap that I thought was not

worth what would be gained from that meeting.
Mr. Baron. Would this have been in the fall of 1963?

Mr. Halley. I have no recollection of the time.

Subsequent to that, Mr. FitzGerald told me that he had

indaed met him and that he had had an interesting conversation

with him. I subsequently recall that this gentleman was met

in Spain at some point in time --

Mr. Baron. This gentleman being AMLASH-1?

Mr. Halley. This gentleman, being AMLASH-1, was met in

Spain. I also recall after having left the Cuban activity that

“I read a Press article showing that. he had been apprehended

for him.

conversations with Desmond FitzGerald, though, in the first

in the second instance his reaction to his contact with AMLASH-1
do you recall FitzGerald mentioning to you the fact that
AMLASH had requested assurances that‘high éfficials of the U.S.
government would stand behind him if he undertook operations on
behalf of the CIA?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall this at the time.

You know, I also want to say, as you probably know from
the record, I was later Chief of the WH Division from 1972 to
1973, and I did read some of the files. I am familiar with
the case. But at the time -- I am trying to be schizophrenic,

you know, to put this in the time sequence in which we are

+talking about. My recollection of that is that I did not know

that.
Mr. Baron. It would then be your testimony that Mr.

FitzGerald never broached with you the subject of making a

officials of the U.S. government would stand behind him?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall that kind of a conversation

taking place with FitzGerald inthis timeframe that we are
talking about.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall any such conversation at any
point?

Mr. Halley.

No, I do not, in the timeframe that we are

talking about.

Mr.

Baron. When I say at any point, I mean at any point
since 1962.

Mr. Malley.

Well, you know, in the period 1972-73, I did

were a series of meetings. You know, I know who the case
officer was and so forth.

Mr. Baron. You never discussed the subject directly with
FitzGerald?

Mr. lialley. With FitzGerald, no. I can only say that my
knowledge of that is secondhand from having subsequently read
the files.

Mr. Baron. Was it your impression at that time that one
of the objectives of the contact with AMLASH-1 was the assassina
tion of Fidel Castro or other high Cuban leaders?

Mr, Halley.

No. I never had the impression that assassina

tion was a thrust of the activity. In other words, we were

FitzGeralé and his staff were working on what I was doing in

Miami to try to establish contacts with the Cuban military.

In other words, we saw this as a multi-faceted approach. First,
we wanted penetrations of the Cuban military so that we could
collect intelligence. What were their strengths, weaknesses,
what was their mood, where were things going? Secondly, we
wanted from these sources operational intelligence. Who -~ in
other words, who in these groups were dissatisfied as Fidel
consolidated. Who could provide leadership for a counter-
movement. against Fidel?

We were looking for people, once we had identified them,
to see if we could establish contacts with any of these leaders
so we could see whether there was a basis for working toward
an overthrow of the Castro government. You know, those were
the basic steps.

Now as you got down to talking about how you overthrow
Castro, obviously the question comes in of how does a ‘group who
wants to run a coup or take power take power, and obviously
one of the things that has to be looked at is where does the
control of the various units. So our discussions were all in
that context.

surprise you now to learn that at least part of the contact

with AMLASH would have involved planning for an assassination

and if you have-not, you should talk to the people who ran the
Artima operation, when this was set up, I think t parti¢ipated
in giving Artime some tutorial training for a couple of weeks
when this operation was first established in order to familiariz
him with some of the problems of trying to manage a large
operation against Cuba because he had been out of things for a
couple of years.

Mr, Baron. Were you aware that he had been supplied a
weapon which we already agreed could be characterized as an
assassination weapon?

Mr. Halley. You say "we." You and I?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

Mr. Halley. Which weapon was that?

Mr. Baron. A high-powered rifle with long-range and low
muzzle velocity.

Mr. Halley. I am aware of the fact of this project that
Artime was involved in that he got a number of weapons, any
number of which could have.been used for sniper type activities.
I am aware of the fact that he had a base in Nicaraqua to
‘have vactivities, so I would find it hard to sinqle out a weapon.
My recollection of that that he was given a large number of
weapons.

Mr. Baron. Was one of Artime's objectives to have been
to assassinate Fidel Castro?

Mr. Halley. Not that I am aware of.

“whole cover’ story, if you will, for him.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear any discussion to the
effect that the Agency was attempting to achieva through Artime
indirectly. what they did not want to achieve directly ina
fashion that would be attributed to tha CIA, namely the
assassination of Castro?

Mr. Halley. I think that you have tied two issues together
there and I do not think I can answer the question that way.

T would like to separate the question into two parts.

Mr. Baron. Go ahead.

Mr. Halley. The first part, as I mentioned to you earlier
the CIA did establish a relationship with Artime and he was
given funds and other support to run his approach to solving
the Cuban problem. le was one of two such activities that were
run at the time. And therefore I think that your statement is
correct that perhaps he was set up so that there could be no
direct attribution in his activities to the United States,
because he set up a base in Nicaragua, and the story as I recall

it was put out that he was receiving assistance from the

So, yes, there was an attempt to set him up as a parallel
track or a separate track. That does not follow from that, in
my perspective, that was geared towards an assassination
operation, because that was a fantastically large operation

involving lots of people, you know, with substantial amounts of

money. I was opposed to it at the tima. And once it was set
up, and I did what I was supposed to do, which was to train
Artime and contribute to his training, I then did not pay an
awful lot of attention to the thing except what I picked up,
you know, over the years, and again in the '72-'73 period,
and talked to officers who had, you know, mere intimate knowledg¢
of it and got an appraisal of it as to what they thought had
occurred.

Mr. Baron. Had you heard at any point that Artime was
supplied weapons for the specific purpose of assassinating
Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, not for the specific purpose of assassina-
ting Castro.

Mr. Baron. Was it your general impression that AMLASI~1
was a reliable agent?

Mr. Halley. I really'do not know that much about him,
you know. This was an operation that was run at that time out
of Washington and, you know, my knowledge was as I described it
to you, the conversations with FitzGerald, Madrid, newspaper
‘articles, so forth, in that particular timeframe.

Mr. Baron. Did the CIA to your knowledge use any gambling
Syndicate contacts inside Cuba or people outside Cuba who were
connected to gambling interests inside Cuba for any operational
purpose including the intelligence gathering?

with gambling interests in Cuba for intelligence gathering?

specific that you want to pursue, if you can give me some other’
clue than that, I just do not, out of my past memory, I simply

Mr. Malley. Well, Executive Action is some sort of a
euphemism -- to eliminate somebody, I guess is how it appears
in the popular jargon.

Mr. Baron. Did you hear it in the Agency?

Mr. Halley. No, I think that this is a term that has been
bandied about in the Press that has come about in the Press to
ba synonymous with killing somebody or something like that.

Mr. Baron. It is not, as far as you know, a euphemism in
common usage within the Agency?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Halley. Let me go back. You asked me about ZRRIFLE.
This is one of a thousand or hundreds of cryptonyms. Every day
I read, you know, hundreds of pages of traffic, so when you ask
me do I know what ZRRIFLE is, I must answer you off the top of
my head no. I have tried to be helpful. T have asked you
several times if you could give me a steering tip or show me
what direction you are going, I might be able to try to comment
on it, but 2RRIFLE as such means nothing to me. You really
could not expect that it would, given the thousands of these
things that come across my dssk.

Mr. Baron. That is absolutely understandable. I want to
try to see what happens in the way of getting an unrefreshed
recollection from you, then I will go back over these two,
especially the next one, QJWIN. Do you recall a CIA asset who
went by the cryptonym QJWIN?

forth, normally it would have something to do with Spain. Tt
does not ring any bells with me, That {s all I can give you,

a sort of Pavlovian response. You flash OJWIN on the screen,

Mr. Baron. Harvey has testified, as has Richard Bissell,
I will represent to you, that instruction was given by Bissell
to Harvey to set up, to develop such a capability in early 1961
and that Harvey took steps to develop such a capability in
coordination with an asset in New York named QJWIN and I think
that period of greatest activity was in 1962 and WIN was
involved in spotting potential assets among the criminal under-
world in Europe and might be used for any number of dirty
deeds.

Mr. diGenova. It should be emphasized that the Executive
Action Plan that you are referring to has had as its goal the

incapacitation of foreign leaders, one possibility of

-incapacitation being the ultimate weapon, assassination. It

was just not assassination. It was a spectrum of activities
that could be used to incapacitate a foreign leader anywhere
from illness, chemical warfare, and then including death.

Near the beginning of this article, it mentions that JMWAVE

Mr. Halley. .I do not recall whether that is an accurate

right ballpark for your activities at the peak?

Mr. Halley. JI just have no recollection of the dollar
figure. You might want.to get that figure when you can retrieve
it in the files. It is available.

Mr. Baron. Were the operations of JMWAVE coordinated with
other Latin American CIA Station's, as the article indicates
here?

Mr. Halley. I think my recollection of that phase is that
Cuban activities with othe Latin American’ stations were
coordinated with JMWAVE.

Mr. Baron. Coordinated with JMWAVE?

Mr. Halley. Washington.

Mr, Baron. Was that. delegated by Washington to you?

Mr. Halley. No. Essentially Washington had the overall

“coordinating responsibility, but that needs some elaboration.

Let me say that we would become aware in our activities in
Miami that a number of interesting people had come in on a
flight to Mexico City. We would send a cable down to Mexico
City with an information copy to Washington, outlining who we

were interested in, and I would probably Send somebody down to

Mexico to look at the particular Cuban or the operational
opportunity in conjunction with the Station Chief in Mexico
City. So we were in some cases a clearinghouse

The final coordination authority rested in Washington. I
will say that if Miami wanted to do something and for local
political reasons in Mexico thé Mexican Station Chief did not
want to do it, that would be adjudicated, not by Miami, but by
Washington.

Mr. Baron. Let me quote you a passage here and see if it
comports with our discussions earlier of spacial arrangements
you may have, the JMWAVE Station may have had, with law enforce-
ment authorities in Florida.

The article says: "All the boat missions to Cuba were tech

nically illegal under the Neutrality Act, the Maritime Laws,
and Immigtation statutes, so that the Station had to work out
special acrangements with Customs, Immiqration and the Coast
Guard."
Is that generally accurate?

Mr. Halley. Immigration, there would not have been
coordination on a particular, you know, boat dispatch. On the

other hand, let's say if a mission aborted for some reason and

a small boat could not recover its position and get back to the

mother ship to be picked up and it was: adrift or cama in to one
of the islands or came in to the Florida coast anywhere and was
picked up and picked up by Immigration inspectors, then they
would ask to have their case referred to a particular individual

Phrase, But then Immigration would get in touch with us and say
we have this group, here is what they say, what is your interest
in this particular group, and then that would ba adjudicated

at that point,

Now the third group was Customs. Customs did have a
number of patrols and at times when boat loadings were conducted
off the Florida Keys in particular, those were coordinated with
the Coast Guard so they would not be expending their manpewer
fo run down groups that were extricating with us, in fact the
Agency was doing.

Mr. Baron. The article continues to say: “rt was illegal
for agents to travel around with machine guns and Plastic |
explosives in the cars, as they often did. The station had to
establish liaison with seventeen police jurisdictions alonq
the Florida coast and into the Keys. The result was that
any agant who was arrested for anything from drunken driving to
illegal possession of firearms would be quickly released."

Is that accurate?

were:no vehicles moving, manned by these Cubans with arms and

In other words, you are coming back to the same point
because as-I explained to you, the weapons were only given to
them on the vessel and taken back from them when they came back
from a mission, so that the statement is not actually correct

the case would be looked at at that particular point and if he
had a Saturday Night Special, you know, there would not be any
intervention on his behalf because it had nothing to do with
his task on the behalf of CIA.

I did mention to you earlier we had training camps in vario
parts of the State. If somebody came out of the training camp
and did get drunk and was picked up and did not speak English
or something and the police jurisdictions did have a way of
getting in touch with us and we might intervene on a case of
disorderly conduct.

Mr, diGenova. How was that established, the relationship o

liaison with these jurisdictions. Had it been set up with

JMWAVE directly through Washington and down through the FBI?
How had that been done?

Mr. Halley. It varied, When we started expanding the
operation, you know, there had already been a Station there
and there also were two security units in the greater Miami

area. In some cases the existing contacts et the Station were

| expanded, the same with Dade County. In other cases, the

security of personnel who had established contact with other
jurisdictions were used to effect the introduction. In some
cases, we had our security people who were on my staff go out
to these jurisdictions and identify themselves simply with a

with these jurisdictions and therefore a liaison was opened on
that basis, a multiplicity of approaches.

Mr. Baron. The article discusses the fact that regular
commando raids were run out of JMWAVE Station to the shore of
Cuba, and that those commandog-were equipped with all kinds of
explosives and armaments.

Is that generally a fair statement, that we were running on|
@ regular basis commando raids to Cuba?

Mr. Halley. Yes. There were a serias of commando raids
run from the Miami Station against targets in Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Were assassination weapons, that is, high-powerp
rifles with low muzzle velocity and telescopic sights, supplied
to those commando teams as a matter of course?

Mr. Halley. .No, they were not. For most of those
commando teams, you were looking for a different kind of a
weapon. You are looking for a weapon with a high range of fire
power over a short distance to deal with an emergency situation

rather than the kind of, you know, weapon that we are talking

In other words, you would find that type of a group armed
with a submachine gun, as for example.

Mr. Baron. I£ an assassination weapon as we have
described it was supplied to a commando team, they would have

to have a specific purpose in mind for its use?

:

Mr. Halley. Yes.

Also, again, all of these weapons were controlled, the
weapons that were issued at the time of the mission on the
mother ship and picked up on the team's return to the mother

ship, so there was accountability for the weapons.

Mr. Baron. “Would it have been unusual to supply what we
have called an assassination weapon to a commando team?

Mr. Halley. Well, that depends on the mission: For
instance, let me use an example.

Most of the missions that were run were run aqainst targets
wthat were in fairly close proximity to the shore. If you are
going to put a party to attack your objectives, let us say the
objective was a petroleum storage tank, if you were going to do
this by putting charges up against the petroleum storage tank
that meant that you had to have a group infiltrate close

énough to put the charges on the tank. Some distance away
from them you would give them a second element of the commando
team which would be providing covering fira for this group in
case they got into trouble and cannot handle it on the ground.
This covering fire group might have had @ light machine gun,

a Belgian weapon. They could have these kinds of weapons and
they did have these kinds of weapons which in the definition youl
are using could be used as a Sniper weapon or whatever, but the
basic reason for having that weapon was.to provide fire support

this mission was over and they returned, those weapons were

so that we did not have weapons disappearing out of our

Mr. Baron. Such weapons, high-powered rifles with telescopic

Mr, Halley. We had high-powered rifles. I cannot think noy
of a case where there was a sniper scope attached to the rifle
I can think of no case where there was a silencer attached to
a rifle in any of these commando raids. ‘There were a number of
raids conducted, some of them involved teams of fifteen or

Mr. Baron. In the Harper's article, it says that Martinez
indicated that "More than once he was given personal charge cf
weapons drops in which special rifles with silencers and tele-
scopic sights were left in designated inland spots."

Do you know of a factual basis for that statement?

Mr. Halley. Martinez is undoubtedly factually correct when
he says he put caches on the ‘coast ofCuba that contained weapons
I do not know how he would be able to tell what kind of weapons
were in the cache. The reason I say that is that when one of
these missions were planned, the cache was put togather and

packed by our logistics group and once the cache was put

together it was brought on board the vessel and the cache was

then turned over to the team for infiltration so he would never
have seen the contents of the cache, he would not have opened
it up because it was always in a sealed container.

It is conceivable that in the pre-mission briefing that
he got before he went down that he was told that we are putting
in a cache containing a radio or putting in a cache containing
weapons because that would influence what he selected as a
cache type. In other words, if it were a radio, we would want
it higher and drier than we would 2 can containing weapons that
were wraped in cosmolene and so forth. He miqht know that they

Mr. Baron. Pid you know of any weapons drops that were

made for the purpose of supplying someone inside Cuba with a
weapon for the assassination of Fidel Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, not for that clearly stated purpose. As
I told you, we put a lot of weapons caches in. The weapons were
multi-purpose weapons, could be usgd. I know of no cache that
went in specifically for the task of playing a contributory role
to dssassinating Fidel Castro.

Mr. Baron. It would not have been contrary to the policy
directives under which you were operating at the time to
supply such a weapon to someone inside Cuba who miqht have
access to Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, it would not have been. For instance,
I can remember several resistance groups thdt’we had that had tw
three hundred men that we were supplying on a regular basis.

Mr. Halley. Inside Cuba, that were essentially living in

got ammunition to them and so forth, And that was why I was
very careful when you mentioned this linkage before to saying
that I could not be a guarantor as to what these men would do
with these weapons once they got their hands on them, They
were free agents.

Mr. diGenova. Were there any restrictions, once, for

example, those weapons caches were delivered either by land or
air -- and we have spoken to Mr. Murray who was in the Havana
Station, for example, for awhile and Arthur Avignon who
was head of the Havana Station for awhile who indicated that
they were aware of the weapons drops and. were intimately
familiar with where they would be

Mr. Halley.

That was all before my time. I have no

knowledge of that. During my time, we made no drops by air.
Mr. diGenova. Were there any limitations that were
placed of how the weapons would be used that were delivered into

Cuba to these internal resistance groups?

Mr. Halley. I cannot speak to this period that you are
addressing.

Mr. diGenova. During your period.

Mr. Halley. During my period, the weapons were issued

essentially as self-protection for the people who were living

in the bush. Secondly, to be used in a military operation at

such time as we got the whole package together. Thirdly, they

I'were to be used for self-protection if they conducted raids,

ambushes, sabotage operations.

Mr. Baron. There is one further quote from Martinez in

this article that I would like to ask you to comment on

He is quoted as saying: “I took a lot of weapons to Cuba, sol

of them were very special weapons for special purposes. They

TOP SECRET



410 Fit Street, S24 Warmington, ©.C. 20903

were powerful rifles with sophisticated scopes, Springfields
with bolt action, rifles only used by snipers. They were not
sent to shoot pigeons or to kill rabbits. Everyone in the
Underground was plotting to kill Castro and the CIA was helping
the Underground. I was with the Underground as wall as the CIA,
so you can see I was involved in, the plots too, but that is

also obvious."

You commented before that there was a lot of talk in the
air about assassinating Castro. Martinez seems to ba taking
that a few steps further, saying that thera were actual plots
underway in the Cuban Underground to assassinate Castro and
that people who worked with the CIA were aware of those plots
and were aiding them in effect by the weapons they were
supplying.

Is that an accurate statement?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not think I can go along with that
statement. Martinez’ role as I described it to you, he is
accurate when he says that weapons were put -in-and that

he participated in putting them in. I again question how he

would know what was in each cac I just do not see that, and

I would have to accept that as a sort of secondhand statement
by him because: of" the way that the caches were put together.
I just do not see his knowing that.

Now I don't want to exclude, however, that any particular

kind of weapon did not go to Cuba. Maybs bolt-action

Mr. diGenova. Could he have found out about this after

| the fact from people that he knew in Cuba, members of the

resistance in Cuba that he knew of who would have told him the
nature of the items that they would have received in a cache
delivery? Would that be one way that he could have found out?
Was he that intimately involved, to your knowledge?

Mr. Halley. He was not at the time. This is the period
that I am familiar with, '62-'65. I do not know. Maybe some
of these people have come out since then, and maybe he has
talked to people who have come out in '68, '69, things like that
I cannot exclude that.

At the time, I do not think, however, he would have had
that kind of firsthand knowledge, and therefore I have trouble
with that statement and I cannot identify with it.

Mr. Baron. The Harper's article says: "By the end of
1961, several men affiliated with the CIA had already been
foiled in attempts to kill him" -- meaning Castro -- "among
them, Luis Toroella, executed; Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, still in
prison; William Morgan, executed; and Antonio Veciana, escaped
to the United States. Had these men succeeded, their efforts
would have been tied to the U.S. only indirectly, if at all."

Mr, Halley. No, there is no connection that I know of
between these names and CIA, This guy Luis Toroella does not
ring any bells with me. Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo was a leader of
Alpha 66. He may have been in Cuba in ‘61. During the time

that I was involved in Cuban affairs he was in exile for -- he

was in Miami for -a long period of time.

Mr. Baron. Can you explain what Alpha 66 is for the
record?

Mr. Halley. Alpha 66 was a Cuban exile organization that
was engaged in a number of raids against the Cuban government
They claimed to have attacked Cuban shipping, fishing boats, and
cleimed to have an organization in Cuba that was a resistance
organization. Gutierrez Menoyo was therefore a well-known name
to me. We had no direct contact with him.

William Morgan is also a well-known name. Wis activities
and exploits in Cuba are well-known to anybody that has dealt
with Cuban affairs.

between any of these people and assassination attempts against
Fidel Castro?

this, I would have no reason to doubt. I would have no basis
for proving it, wither.

forth, and the Agency had no contact with him during that
Period of time.

Mx. Baron. Are you aware of his ‘ever having been on the
payroll of the CIA?

Mr. Halley. I personally am not aware of it, and I think,
you know,if ybu had gone to the Agency that they must ‘have ‘given
you all sorts of traces on this fellow and.told you the same

thing.

Baron. Are you aware of the AMOT program?

Walley. Yes, I am.

Baron. How'was that spelled?

Halley. AMOT.

Baron. What was that program?

Halley. That was a program involving a Cuban emigre
group that was used as an operational support mechanism to

support the Miami Station.

Mr. Baron. What kind of support did they provide?

Mr. Halley. They were interviewers of refugees who came
out of Cuba. They provided translator personnel to translate
the Spanish language publications that were of interest to us.
They provided information on the various mainstream activities
that were going on in the Cuban exile community.

Mr. Baron. Did they provide support for paramilitary
operations against Cuba?

Mr. Halley. They might have identified people whom they
thought we should interview or look to or see if they would
fit into other paramilitary programs. In other words, they
had the contacts.in the Cuban community. Say we had a require-
ment for a diesel engineer. We would say to the AMOT organiza-
tion, we would say we are looking for a Cuban who is a diesel
engineer who has a first engine's license, and they would go
through all of their contacts until they would come up with

one, a Week or ten days or whatever, having identified

the fellow, where he was, what he was doing.

Send somebody around to talk to him independent of them and
pick him up to work for us in our maritime activities.

It was that kind of operational support.

Mr. Baron. People who were part of this program were
not used as paramilitary operatives, at least insofar as they
operated under the aegis of this program. There were some of
them who may have been in the paramilitary program and then
left it and were subsequently picked up in the AMUT organiza-
tion.

Could we go off the record for a moment?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Malley. We are now back on the record.

The AMOTs also worked with us on a common project, which
was monitoring Cuban naval traffic, things like that, so they
were used across the hoard for operational support tasks.

Mr. Baron. One more general question.

Did the JMWAVE Station have an operational relationship

the FBI?

Mr. Halley. I would not --

Mr. Baron. Was the FBI involved in supporting your
activities in any way?

Mr. Halley. I would rather phrase that in my language,
because I think

Mr. Baron. Go right ahead.

Mr. Halley. Ido not know if your question means the same
thing to me. I would prefer to say we had a liaison relation-
ship with the FBI, that is, on matters dealing with counter-

intelligence matters. There was a regular-exchange of data

with the FBI. There was an exchange of name traces on people

that they were conducting investigations on, for countérintelli
gence purposes,We would trace certain individuals and with the
FBI there were a couple of counterintelligenca cases that we
discovered that were turned over to the FRI.
So this is in the context of the normal CIA-FBI liaison
that existed between the two aqencies.
But the FBI was not involved in supporting

Mr, Baron.

correct?
Mr, Halley. I do not know what you are driving at

there. I am having a little trouble with that. are you saying

that the FBI dispatched paramilitary teams to Cuba as

an organization?

Were they involved in paramilitary training

Mr. Baron.

“of any of the CIA operatives?

Mr. Halley. No. The FBI did not train any CIA personnel

during my tenure in the Miami Station.
Mr. Baron. Did the FBI at any point provide with you
links to people who had gambling interests inside Cuba?

Mr. Walley. No. We covered the gambling thing previously.

Mr. Baron. Were you aver mada aware of a CIA attempt to
secure the aid of a pilot, a Cuban pilot, to arrange for an
“accideht," to occur to Raul Castro when he flew on a Cuban
plane?

Mr. Halley. I read this somewhere in the record in post
years, but I was not aware of this at the time, at the time I
was in Miami.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that serious consideration had

Mr. Halley. I went through this before before you came
in and explained to Mr. Baron that the subject of assassination
was constantly being discussed in the Cuban community and was a
part of the fabric of the times.

Mr. diGenova. That I am aware of. You are not the only
one who has expressed that. knowledge that they were all saying

let's kill him, let's get together: °.

Mr. Halley. There was a lot of discussion of this kind of
subject of assassination and that is why I keep trying to be
precise that there was no programmatic operational program that
I was aware of to assassinate Castro.

Mr. Baron. Although the context in which we discussed the
talk that was in the air of assassinating Castro was coffee shop
in Miami and conversation among Cubans as opposed to conversa-
tions among high CIA officials back in Headquarters, were you

aware that there were at least serious discussions of the

use of assassination against Castre at CIA Headquarters?

Mr. iialley. No, I was not. We are plowing the same ground|
that we covered before in this.

As I indicated to you, people would come out of Cuba and
discuss these kinds of things. Some of these were reported in,
you know, traffic back to Washington. People would discuss
what are the prospects of somebody assigned to assassinate
Castro. In that particular context, yes, discussions on the
assassination of Castro took place. That is why I keep coming

back, if you are saying that if anybody outlined an operational

plan to me, did I help construct the plan, did I make a contri-
bution to a plan, my answer is again no. Wa talked earlier,
you asked me about those exploding sea shells of which'I said

I had never heard of but I had heard discussions of Castro's
vulnerability because he was a scuba diver. And you asked me
about bacteria, I said I had never heard of an introduction of
bacteria, but I had heard again about Castro's vulnerability

in this context. Where I heard it, as I told you before, I do
not remember,

Mr. Baron. I realize We are plowing some of the same
furroughs again. I am trying to be meticulous in the way you
were before. You just now said that the subject of assassina~
tion probably came up in the context of discussing the contin-
gencies of Castro's death. Did it come up in terms of discus-~
sing whether or not a plan should be put together to assassinate
Castro, whether or not an operation should be mounted --

Mr. Halley. “I cannot recall any such discussion, but in

any state where there is a leadership dominated by one man, it

‘is always a discussion of succession. That question has come

up, you know, if something happened to Fidel Castro, if he is

thrown over, if he does something foolish himself or if somebody

is successful in assassinating him, somebody who decides sudden-

ly to take his machetti and just get out in the sugar cane

field, again, the question was, who replaces Castro, and we

Generally focused on Raul. There was talk of a collective

leadership.
These are all kinds of things that are always done.against

that kind of a one-man state, whether it is, you know, a

Communist state or whatever you want to talk, call it a

military dictatorship or a dictatorship of the Right or the

Left.

Mr. Baron. Again, discussion of what to do upon the
contingency that Castro dies, by whatever means --

Mr. Halley. Non-Agency induced.

Mr. Baron. As opposed to this, which is my tion:
Were you aware of any kind of a discussion at CIA Headquarters
on whether or not the CIA should induce the death of Fidel
Castro? 7

Mr. Halley. I do not recall any such discussion. That
is why I have gone into all this background to try to explain
the mood of the times and that is why I keep referring to, in
my sense of the word, as a professional intelligence officer,

of an operational plan, I was not a participant in any discus-~

‘sion in which an operational plan for the assassination of

Castro was discussed. That is, I think, the heart of the
matter.

Mr. Baron. TI have no further questions.

in terms of reporting from Miami?

Mr, Halley. Could we go off the record?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. diGenova. Mr, Halley, we have just had a brief
discussion here about some of the things that were covered
before I arrived by Mr. Baron and*you. I do not want to cover
any more of that ground.

it is my understanding in discussing the structure of
JMWAVE's relationship with Headquarters, General Lansdale's
name came up, and that on one occasion, General Lansdale actually}
came down to Miami to visit the Station to qat firsthand
knowledge of what was transpiring. Is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. diGenova. Do you have-any idea when that was?

Mr. Halley. No. I stated earlier it was in 1962. It
Probably was in the summer of 1962 hecause it was after my
family arrived in Miami. I do not remember the exact dates.
It could be established probably from records of the Agency.

I do not recall it specifically.

Mr. diGenova. To your knowledge, did he-travel by himself
or was he with compatriots or aides?

Mr. Halley. My recollection of that was that he came down
on a special airplane. There may have been other people on the
plane with him, I do not recall, but he landed at Homestead
Air Force Base. As I recall, we picked him up from there.

Mr. diGenova. Did General Lansdale travel under his own

or under a cover name?

Mr. Halley. Throughout the time that he was in contact

me and the Station he was operating as General Lansdale.

Mr. diGenova. Did he have contact when ha was there with

of the assets themselves? ~

Mr. Halley. le had no contact with any Cubans that I am
aware of. He did spend the night that he came down with some
friends at Homestead Air Force Base, but I do not recall, I
would have no way of knowing what he did that evening.

Mr. diGenova. For the time that he was at JMWAVE he was
with officials such as yourself who had a supervisory capacity
at JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. diGenova. I have no further quastions.

Mr. Baron. On the record, I just want to thank you for
your testimony here today. It has been a long day and we
have gone over a lot of things quite carefully and it has been
most informative.

I would also like to ask you, if you would, to pursue for
us that one name of the man who was connected with gambling
