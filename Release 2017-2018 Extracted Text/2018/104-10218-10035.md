‘l. Identification — rl 7 i
Mexico City, Mexico. Support for singleton contract agent

operating into right-wing political milieu in Mexico for

intelligence purposes with some covert action by-product.

2. Objectives

a. Objective The objective of this project is to provide
support for a U.S. contract agent who has access to a wide variety
of right-wing political elements and organizations in Mexico.

b. Conduct of Project The contract agent, LIHUFF/1, was born
in Mexico and has had a long history of business experience in
Latin America, as well as, over the past fifteen years, in Mexico.
At the present time, he is|
which gives him a great deal of mobility
in both American and Mexican business circles. Generally, it is
from the Mexican business community that the financing and support :
for right-wing political movements, organizations, and institutions
eminate. Given the general trend of recent Mexican regimes, as
well as the present one, toward more governmental regulation and
manipulation of the economic life of the country, the Mexican
businessmen continue to support right-wing political movements or
ostensibly nongrofit civic, research, and other types of organiza-

their philosophy and taking action in the politico-cconomic fields.
LIHUFF/1 has natural access through his present position and past
extensive experience in the business community here. Over the
years, as a matter of fact, his numerous associations with these
elements have earned him their trust and respect. In addition
the past four years he has funded

organization, consisting primarily

(a tagazine on

politico-economic affairs), and
a Student organization). Also, he.
has handled LICHANT/1 who has a history of, and numerous associa-
tions in, the Mexican right-wing political arena. These and many
other contacts of this type will provide the basis for his reports -|
on this particular segment of the political spectrum in Mexico.

c. Targets Right-wing political elements and organizations
in Mexico. This would include not only
and but and numerous
others of political significance on the Mexican scene. In connection
with LICHANT/1's present

a.

3. Background,

Developments Leading '.p to Project.

(1) Mexico, politically, is a country in which, _

Increasingly, a centrist political concensus is developing
based on the impact of education and economic development.

- On either side though of this growing central political

spectrum are extreme ‘left and extreme right wings which are
quite active and quite vocal and which have an influence in
the form of individuals, organizations, and movements greatly
out of proportion to their numbers, Political disturbances
and efforts to induce jack of stability eminate in the main
from these two extreme wings.
slowly, it is possible and probable. that these two wings wil
intensify their efforts and become more and more radical.

The Station has intelligence coverage of the extreme left-
wing, but has neglected the equally. important extreme ‘right-
wing when, in the final analysis, any threat to Mexican
political stability by fomenting unrest and incidents does,
and will continue to, eminate from the right-wing as well as
the left-wing.
RMD, the long range national policy objectives of the U.S.

toward Mexico are to encourage a stable democratic government

As the centrist force grows

Assumin g that, as indicated in the present

and political environment, then coverage of the right-wing

is required if for no other reason than meeting normal Station

responsibilities for political reporting. HBFINCH contacts
in.this area have been, and probably will continue to be,

virtually nil.
contacts are non-existent.

LIHUFF/1 was first picked up as a contact by

for some three years (while

engaged in business in Panama}. He has been in a continuing

ever since then. This relationship developed from "contact"
into formal contract status in November 1962. LIHUFF/1 has
handled Station congtacts and activitics with LIHUFF /2

_. as well as LICHANT/1] from 1962 to date, In
‘addi tlon? ‘he has done a good deal of reporting on right-wing
activities from other sources and other contacts of his.
Subsidy, of the LIHUFF activity for MHSPAWN purposes

will be terminated effective

“30 June 1965. Use of LICHANT/1 will be continued in an
intelligence reporting capacity and,in a limited way, for
covert action efforts.

b. Prior Negotiations. There have been no prior

negotiations with the Mexican Government, intelligence or
security services, or ODYOKE elements on this project.
LIHUFF/1 has been used in the past, prior to his contract
with KUBARK, as a source by ODIBEX and ODMARK.

c. .Relationship to Other Projects. This project
has no relationship to any Gee Station project.

d. Utilization of Same Operational Assets,
_ CEHUFF/1 has not beenutilized:on any other project, past. or
present, except to the extent|he was involved with the LIHUFF
activity indicated:-in subparagraph 3a(2) above.

4. Qperational Assets.

a. Personnel.

(1) LIHUFF/1 (OA granted on 10 October 1962
with no number forwarded to field) -- Subject was born in
Mexico, is fluent in Spanish, and is about 49 years old.
Since World War II, he has been in private business in Latin
America, first in Panama and then in Mexico from 1950 on.
During World War Il, he was in Army intelligence in China and,
therefore, had an understanding of covert operations prior to
his KUBARK experience. While in Panama, he was employed by
there for several years * to organize a net

Tected against a target of high priority interest". This
association was terminated by reason of his move to Mexico

for business reasons,

Although he was in contact with this

virtually from his time of arrival in Mexico, he was

not picked up as

luntil November 1962. His

ties has been natural:

Mexican Government. Contact with him is covered by a social
relationship between his case officer and.himself; this is
easily maintained. given the large American community in Mexico
City. He hes had no formal intelligence training other than
that he received from the Army during World War 11 and on the
job with KUBARK. Control of Subject is no problem inasmuch

as he is an American citizen and has had considerable
experience with KUBARK by now, His motivation is that of an
attraction to this type of work, being a U.S, citizen In a
foreign area, natural concern forhis business interests, and,
probably, the compensatory return from KUBARK. He is witting
of his KUBARK association and, aside from his World War If
intelligence experience with ODIBEX, in 1961 he had an .
intelligence relationship with. ODIBEX which has long since
been terminated.

(2) LICHANT/1, (0A granted on 22 April 1963,
but no number forwarded to field) -- Subject is a ene
conservative Mexican educator and intellectual about 49 years
of age. He has alternated between working in various
capacities for the i i
universities. At the present time,
position which gives him unique access
the general fields of education and politics as well as
considerable contact with other influential people in right~
wing circles,, He was recruited by LIHUFF/1 im August 1962
on the pretext of doing research work and collecting infor-
mation for LIHUFF/I's general use for business purposes.
Subject has natural cover for obtaining: information on right=
wing activities from others due to his long association with
right-wing activities as a student, educator, and government
servant. Contact between Subject and LIHUFF/1 is maintained
under the guise of Subject has
had no intelligence training from KUBARK other than that
imparted by LIHUFF/1 in discussing his reports. There has
been no problems in control since essentially. Subject under-
stands that this is a business relationship with certain
requirements involved for it to be sustained. Subject's
motivation is that of an intellectual ly-convinced conservative
who has common objectives and outlook with LIHUFF/1 on
political and economic matters plus the financial aspect of
the LIHUFF/1 relationship. Subject is not witting of KUBARK
or ODYOKE interest in his activities and reporting. He has no
known contacts with other intelligence or security services,
past or present.

b. Mechanisms, There will be no mechanisms Involved

the extent of the compromise, there would be’ no repercussion
Insofar as other operations or activities per se were
concerned except that there might be some tightening of the
poneral operational climate for a while. If, somehow,

SHUFF/I's true role were disclosed, he could probably be
backstopped with a minimum of publicity through high-level
Station contacts with the Government (explaining the Station
Interest In right-wing circles as attempting to follow what |
they were up to In case they became a threat to the stability
of the present government).

No coordination Is desirable or required with other
ODYOKE or PBPRIME elements, with the Mexican government, or
with other governments and ingest ence services.. It Is
