SUBJECT

:Donn MtV ON, luthor or 21GA liticle, and

Juan ERjUIAGA, Subject of Article.

1. Donn Hale MUNSON, born 1005, reiident of Los

Angeles, approached LICONET/1 in 196k claiming he

represented a large group. of Cuban exiles in the Los

Angeles area. NUNSON

asked LICCtrT/1 about the location

of training camps, etc. LICONET/1 roported the discussion

to Station Mexico City and was instructed to avoid NUNSON.

Donn Hale MUNSON is probably identical with the Donn MUNSON

who authored the saga article. There are no additional

identifiable traces on MUNSON.

2. There are nunerous traces on Juan ERQUINGA sircorbe,

arus to Cuban revolutionaries in 1055. A1chough RI was un-

able to locate the repore, it was classified co Manolo MY's

201 file. This nould tend

to support the 5024 claim that

any weapons suoplied bu ERCUlAGA's firn went to the JUlE

crowd, not to any Agency supported group.

Arcos in obtaining his freedom but admitted

he had no commo or means of making coutact

with him in prison.

D.

Raj is interested in expanding his

propaganda radio broadeasts.

He spoke in terus

of ronting timo on a U.S. short wave station

to beam broadeasts to Cuba.

This would be

done at his own expense. He also mentioned

ithat during Roid's former administration in

the Dominican Republic he had been promised

a site and permission to set up a short wave

station for Cuban broadcasts.

He may explore

this possibility with Balaguer's present

government during one of his business trips

to the D.R.

I suggested he sound out other

stations in L.A, to see if he could get some

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meetings with Manolo Ray, San Juan, Puerto Rico

MIG-21--Defecting Pllot--ot al.

In lengthy discussions on this point it developed

nation sinco he first called the matter to AMBADGER's

attention almost two months ago.

The basis of the "Nig

Plot"

1o & tip

he received from

an inside contact which was

brought to him

by someone exiting Cuba.

inside contact reliable but profers not to identify him.

Ray has not been able to determine if the inside contact

is personally in contact,

or can

arrango contact, with the

Mig Pilot who reportedly is fed up with the situation in

Cuba and plans to defect with his airplane whenever he has

The "tip" Ray received was to this effect

1.C., that there is a Mig Pllot who is disenchanted and

plans to defect with his plane.

One point Ray was spocific

that the plane was described as "one of the smaller

Migs" and according to Ray it 1s not & 11g-21.

20 .

After Ray's original contacts with AMBADGER on this

subject (wherein the plane was apparently erroneously

identified as a MIG-21) Ray claims ho sent a message to the

inside contact requesting the complete detatls-we had asked

for.

He has received no reply.

In response to my request

at

the mooting on 13 October 1966 he told me at our subsequent

meeting

on

15 October that he attempted to reach his inside

contact by phone but was unsuccessful.

He was urged to

continue until he reached the party and to obtain as much

detail on this

matter as possible so we could hopefally

clarify the situation.

He assurred me he would follow through

on this and report to AMBADGER.

(It seemed pretty obvious to

me after two discussions with Ray on this subject that he has

no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on

the "Mig

Plot"

and consequently may never be able to verify

the original "tip" and obtain further details.

and sources reiterating again that therefore it was essential

that he confirm

the plane,

modol, pilot, etc. reported to

him to determine if the operation was feasible.

We spent sometime discussing his "image" both

• inside Cuba and with the exiles.

He agreed that at the

present time it could hardly be lower and something rather

dramatic was needed to improve it.

We both agreed that if

he could pull off a successful operation to defect a MIG-21

pilot with his plane it would do much to restore his and :

the JURE's name and prestige.

NENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

Personal Situation:

an san juan his no saineering ad pla dung office

a personal friend and JURE colleague who is in the

publicity business.

RAY said he just signed a

contract for the planning of a commercial develop

ment site in San Juan,

from which he will realize

several thousand dollars profit.

His principal

(and pet) project is the promotion and attempt to

raise through private funds the financing of a

plant to mass produce low-cost prefabricated housing

designed by him. He claims with an investment of

$200,000 he can

mass produce prefabricated homes to

for $3,000 which would be ideal for Puerto

Rico's needs.

Recent Trip to Santo Domingo:

RAY said his recent trip to Santo Domingo

was strictly for business purposes.

He hopes to

start a small project in Santo Domingo to produce

prefabricated housing.

The small project he has

in mind can get underway with an expenditure of

$80,000, which he feels confident can be raised

in Santo Domingo.

He said he naturally talked with

some people in the government about Cuba and the

JURE, but that the government must become stronger

and more confident before there would be any possi

bility of obtaining their assistance-or blessing-=

in conducting any activities against Cuba.

Internal Contacts.

d. One gets the impression that RAY lives

somewhat removed from the actual realitiesd the

•Cuban

internal situation.

He has & tendency to

compare

the

internal situation today with that

which existed in Batista's time when he (RAY) was

one of the leaders of the 26th of July underground

resistance

movement in Habana. RAY maintains

direct personal contact with many new arrivals

seeking asylum both in Puerto Rico and the U.S.

and also undoubtedly receives a certain amount of

general information and gossip from other JURE

contacts and supporters.

He claims to have many

friends and former associates illside, which is

probably true, but does not have any regular or

secure means to communicate with them.

It appears

obvious that these friends and contacts are not

working together, if at. all, and that he has no

cohesive resistance group or force as such inside.

I questioned him about several personalities

such as Carlos Franqui, Pedro Miret, Emilio Aragones,

and others.

He had no specific information

on their activities in recent months but said he

"could get

it if you want it."

In summary on this

point, it would appear that RAY and the JURE main-

no regular contact with any internal "supporters":

that he undoubtedly still has many former friends

and supporters inside but just what they would do-

far they would go--to support him is a moot

JURE Propaganda Activities.

The JURE, Manolo RAY, Emilio Guede, and

others, have a half-hour weekly program which is

carried on 4 different Puerto Rican radio stations

between 6:30=7:30 PM each Sunday.

which is taped in advance,

features commentaries on

news and events in Cuba,

interviews with recently

arrived refugees, and other items of current interest.

The program is composed without cost

and all radio time on the 4 stations is donated free

of charge.

and fighter in the 20th of July norement against

Batista, he knows the value of propaganda in preparing

the general populaco for resistance.

He also knows

that propaganda is uscless and counterproductive

without follow-up positive results.

He speaks of

continuing his local radio broadcasts (which he

readily admits are useful only to maintain some

spirit amongst the oxiles for possible future use),

and at some

later dato--he has no timetable--hopes

to obtain facilities in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, or

some othor site where he can beam broadcasts into Cuba.

His intention being to follow-up the broadcasts with

action.

He speaks again of clandestine entry into

Cuba himself

to contact sources within, prove to

people that there is a resistance movement, and to

form

a nucleus for later action.

He openly admits

the blunder

of his last "publicized" return and that

if it is done again it must be completely clandestine

and

unannounced.

He seems to have no fear of returning

and claims

he still has plenty of frierds who would

hide and help him.

sources in Miami surely knew of several"fraily run"

operations which

could take him successfully to Cuba

Financial Situation.

•RAY made no request for financial assistance

and from all indications is doing fairly well in his

local business.

RAY plans to travel to the U.S. inarly November for

about

two weeks and said he would visit JURE representatives

in several large cities, including D.C. He will be in touch

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY / FiLe

1. During a brief TDY stopover at Headquarters on 23 August 1966,

QUSPORT -I said he had talked with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto Rice

on 22 August.

According to QUSPORT-I, RAY had no additional pertinen

information ange in Mir diSpat inside once or he recent meetings

inside support in Cuba and contacta who are anti-regime and prepare

o assist him when needed. He did not reveal to QUSPORT-I, however

who the people were or where they are located.

2. RAY told QUSPORT -I that he wanted very much to see the writer

concerning a delicate operational matter. When pressed by QUSPORT -1

RAY said he had access to a MIG pilot in Cuba who was ready and anxious

to leave Cuba and was willing to fly out a MIG aircraft. RAY did not

mention the name or location of the pilot or the model MIG aircraft he was

flying.

Neither did he discuss his ways and means of communication with

the pilot and how he had determined the pilot's intentions to defect with

his airplane.

RAY told QUSPORT he wanted to discuss the matter with the

He admitted that a MIG aircraft might not now have as much value

to the U.S. because of the recent access to a MIG-2l in Isreal but that it

would have tremendous propaganda value if a Cuban pilot defected and

brought out a MIC. He said he particularly wanted to discuss the matter

with the writer because if the operation were successful he did not want

Manuel Artime and the MRR or any other exile group taking credit. He

wanied to make sure that he and his group received all the propaganda

advantage which he would in turn expluit internally as further evidence to

his supporters inside that the JURE was active on the island. RAY in the

latter part oi the conversation on this subject when he learned QUSPORT -1

was coming to Washington the following day, asked him to check with the

writer to determine if it was OK for him (RAY) to discuss this subject with

AMBADGER. (AMBADGER is the man who was recently introduced to RAY

in San Juan by Harry Mahoney as the man who would insure that any

intormation RAY wanted passed to the Agency would reach them. ) QUSPORT

told RAY that if he did not receive a phone call from him before the evening

of 20 August he should give AMBADGER all the details.

3. 1801d QUSPORT 8u phore RAY and assure him that Iwanted

him to jass all the details to AMBADGER even though according lo

QUSPORT-l's arrangement this was aut necessary.

OUSPORT-I was

unable, however, lo reach RAt by phone during the afternoon of

nO August.

About 3 p.in. on 50 lugust I received a collect phone call

from AMBADGER from San Juan.

AMBADGER was very excited and

said he had to see me right away. liter he settled down a bit he told

me he had just left RAY and his tro local lieutenants Emilio GUEDE

and Arturo VILLAR (the so-called triumvirate of the JURE). He said

RAY had contacted him and the four of them discussed the possibility

of defecting a Cuban MIG pilot and having him bring out his plane. In

essence and from what I could discuss over the phone the details were

substantially the same as those given to me by QUSPORT -I earlier in

the day. AMBADGER said he needed my guidance right away and

further urged me to come to San Juan to discuss the matter with RAY

who was pressing AMBADGER to see me.

He said he had agreed to see

RAY latter that night, I told AMBADGER I could not make the trip in

the next few days and that further there were a few basic facts I needed

to convince me that RAY really had the potential to pull off the operation.

I told AMBADGER to see RAY later that evening and to try and determine

the following:

a. Name of the MIG pilot.

b. Military field where he is stationed.

c. Type MIG he flys.

d. RAY's commo if any with the pilot.

e. Estimated timing for the defection, i. e.. has the pilot

indicated he was ready to defect and awaiting instructions,

etc.

I asked AMBADGER to phone me if he could develop any further

information AMBADGER phoned Mr. Mahoney on the afternoon of

24 August to report he had attempted to obtain further details from RAY

following his conversations with the writer but that RAY had replied he

did not know the name of the pilot or other details of the operation. (See

Mr. Mahoney's meino attached)

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meeting with ANBANG-1, 28 April 1966

Andrews as Tid April 1908 the undersigned, usine the name

contacted ANBANG-1

the Hotel Sheraton in San Juan,

Puerto Rico. The following

points were discussed,

in addition to matters pertaining to

& projected

meeting of Cuban exiles, covered in a separate

AMBANG seemed much less aggressive than

when I used to talk to him a year and a half ago.

He seemed dispirited about the exiles and their

chances of ever doing anything to settle affairs

in Cuba.

The exiles do not seem to have any plans

for doing much of anything.

AMBANG-1 agreed that

the overthrow of Castro will probably come from the

inside, and that the exiles will have little

influence on the move that accomplishes it.

feels this is not all to the bad since, as le says,

there are a number of good men in Cuba in Important

posts who have

gotten sucked bit by bit into support

of communism but are really not communists.

him I believed the US would probably be willing to

such persons if they achieved the overthrow

of the regime and that the US would probably oppose

a wave of vengeance against "decent revolutionaries".

I told him this because I thought there was some

chance he might spread it about and the word might

"decent revolutionaries" in CubA,

In general, AHBANG-1 had less information

curge situation than I did.

He told me that

had been in telephone contact with the family inside

## Page 87

Cuba about 25 April, that Arcos was as of that

Jate still in prison but the charges against him

were thin and it was hoyed he would be out in a

few days.

(This means there was at least one

nore telephone call than we knew of previously,

and this has probably

served to increase the

pressure on Arcos).

I asked AVBANG-1 if his

contact with Arcos

in late 196% might not

have

been responsible for the arrest. AMBANG-I said

he did not think so.

We talked some about the

symbolic value of the Arcos family and I expressed

a strong interest in Arcos's welfare and in getting

the latest news about him.

I did this on the

chance that AMRANG-1 might assume Arcos had been

cur agent and we were concerned about him.

I do

not know if he will actually construe my remark in

this way, however, but it seemed like an opening

to use an important exile channel as a possible

deception mechanism.

AMBANG said he does not

believe there is any truth to the charge of financial

dishonesty levelled against Arcos.

d. Rene RODRIGUEZ Cruz (201-224329): AMBANG-1

as a compulsive, capable of doing harm

to anyone,

including Fidel Castro.

but does not know his associate

Carlos Laplace, who shows up in Mexico from time to

I raised the matter of Rene RODRIGUEZ merely to

sound

ASBANG out, but it may be he thinks we have

some special interest in him.

e.

About Osmani CIENFUEGOS (20T-270T64), AMBÄNG

stated

he was a member of the PSP

in the middle 1950's.

He is a competent architect but otherwise a person of

limited capacity.

He is not a member of the inner

circle of the Old Guard PSP and never was.

He got

involved with the PSP out of opportunism, he is a

schemer, self seeker and very unreliable.

f. I told AMBANG I had heard Emilio Aragones had

been arrested.

AMBANG was surprised and said he would

why he should have been selected to make two recent

AMBANG, does not have the qualities of an adminis-

trator but he is very good at situating himself

and dealing.

as many say.

AMBANG regards Hart as a much

more decent

person than Aragones and to be well placed

in Aragone's old job because he does not have

notoriously close

connections with any of the

personalities or factions within the 26th of July

but gets along with them all.

Concerning the differences between the city

and

sierra fighters

in

the 26th

of July, AMBANG stated

they are real and that the city group fought and

suffered much

more.

AMBANG believes this is not the time for the

US or exiles to make menacing gestiues against Cuba,

for this would merely provide Castro with distractions

from internal problems

and perhaps enable him

to rally

popular support.

2.

I believe that later in the summer it might be a good

dea to have another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exil

hinking, and feeding more deception thought:

Communit infiltration of the government. After the arrest aad

Imprisonment of Huber MATOS In Ocroser 1999. RAY made bla

concern koown to CASTRO and was aubeequently dismiesed and

replaced by a Communias.

Between the time of his diamlesal and

October 1960, when he extilirated to the United States, RAY devoted

bie time to the organization of the Movimiento Revoluclonario de

RAY cid aot like many of the othor leaders becalee be bellered

they did nor truet him. In fact, many oi the Cuban exiles were

reported to have stated that serving under RAY was nothing more

new revolutionary organ was needed. In the summer of 19t2 be

proposed that a military junta be lormed in which each of the different

exile groupe would be represented and have a vote on the junta'a

activities.

He believed thia would give more unlty to their cause

and insure against blatant failures. He was highly critical of bob

the invaslon attempt of 1961 and with himeoll for giving his approval

to the operation. RAY fell that his new organization would be able

to avoid similar failuses. The new group was tormed at that time

The position of. JURE within the Cuban exile

connuntly was

weakened after Ray

failed to

keep his widely

publicized promise to land in Cuba by 20 May 1904.

Since then

tho organization has been clatively inactive®

Recontly Ray

has been making an effort to again establish a strong JURE.

On

22 May 1965 he gave a lecture

in Miami to JURF delegates from

Tampa, Orlando,

and Miami,

in

which he stressed the need to

raise

money for the

organization.

The feeling

ot some member's

who

attended

that it was rather late

asking people to

delegates

of the JURE was held in Tampa, Florida, from 3

5 July 1965

to discuss the program and

future plans of the JUrE.

On 5 and 6 July Ray held discussions with representatives of

RETRACE®

LA 45365, dated & June 1985

1.

Further to our telephone conversation of 16 June

we should like to clarily that whereas it is true that we

had, and to a limited degree have, contact with lanuel Ray,

who apparently bought sone of the arna impounded by the

Calliornle authoritles in the Erquiaga plant, ve are in

no way connected with Subject. Ray purchasod these weapons

strictly on his own initiative. He was neither counselled

to do so by us nor have ve ever referred his to Erquiaga.

Furthermore this Agency has no connection Ghatever with

any of the individuals

nontloned in the paragraph 1 listing

of roference.

What little contact we naintain with Ray 1s

aainly within the contaxt of our conoral interest in keeping

abreast of Cuban exile activities.

Our Interost In Erguinga,

therefore, was in heoping with this goneral interost.

3.

We are most appreciative of your los Angeles

offico's elforts on our behall.

Should the fad query your

Los Angoles office about our interest and connections with

Subject 1€ 13

suggested that they answer along the lines

set forth above.

It 1a also requested that your office

continue to keop us apprised

of the current developments

in this case.

(a) 059 Bpeed Letter Reply, undated

The folloving 18 tant to clarify ref. (a), and to bring yo

- up-to-date.

un unnaned source of TBI-LA advised that office tha

subject, then representing the last three of the above business atyles,

called on hia 1n April and inquired as to the latter's ability to tura

out vaguely described peral products, supposedly office equipment items.

This presumbly us a protext ss subject called again in lay, then repre

senting Communicationg Specieltles,

and asked 1f (this FBI) source could

about 1,000 silencers, for use on 9 ma machine pistols, and

mant (very confidentially) for a customer in northern California.

Bubject implied for himelf ar earlier ascociation with Consolidated

Electrodynaice Corp., a ilghly reputable scientific instrumot mnuo

facturer, and with Aerojet General Corp., which we knuw to be dabbling

ln ordnanco specialtles. Subject also made reforence to some vague

Balos or business relatsonship with "the City of Commerce concern that

sus raided recently", undoubtedly Erquiage Arma Co.

2. YBI-lA feels it aust alert Custone on the off-chance that

subject may be exporting unis Item, and also that it cannot afford

not to advise the State of California Departnent of Juetice, since

mere possession of a allancer 1a a felony, and prior knowledge, ta

the event there was a major incident of uny kind, would be difficult

to explain.

MEMORANDUM FOR THS RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with AMBANG/1, 7 April 1965

1.

Subject phoned (collect) from San Juan on the

morning of T April

1965.

he underaigned

Antonolll, spoke with him.

ANBANG/1

Ad, danted to know

whether we had any further information on the status of the

legal case

arising from the seizure of the armg being

manufactured for him by the Erquiaga Manuracturing Company.

He was told that we had receivod further information lud catin

that the case was undertaken by the state authorities and

that there wore son Irregularitlos Involved In the search

warrant.

Under the circumstances, we plan to take no action

to interfere with the legal process since it would appear that

the manufacturer has a very good case, and since federal

involvement with publicity hungry state authorities could lead

to totally counterproductive publicity and complications.

Al sald he understood and agreed.

He asked how long the

matter might be delajed.

He was advised that thie would have

to be checked with the

manufacturer's attorney, but since the

seizure took place, it would appear that the court would have

to take prompt action to rule on ita legality. He was told

that a hearing was scheduled for 6 or 7 April

on the mattor.

Rico

2.

He sald that he had chocked with his man in Costa

who had spoken with President Orlich and with Daniel

Oduber.

They had advised that they

cannot receive the arns

in Costa Rico at the present time bocause of publicity and

scandal raised by the oppusition.

They are willing to consider

the matter later.

A/I said that the manuincturer had been

unable to locate in his files the original purchase order for

the arms which was aigned by Oduber.

A/l said that ho has a

signed copy In his possession. Ho was advised not to nec this

without checking with Oduber since its use might hurt Oduber's

chances of winning the presidential elcctions.

A/1 sald he

would not use this paper since he agreed that

the friondship

of the PLN 18 more important, even than the arms, which are the

key to his current plans.

Me praised the PLN's past support

and said he did not vant to risk losing this support.

SUBJECT: Phone Call from ANLANG, 1 April 1965

Subjeet phoned (collect) on 1 April to determine

what information I had arrivod at concerning the seizure

of arms being made to his order by the ERQUIAGA Manufacturing

Company.

I told him as far as we were able to determine

on the basis of incomplote information that the arms had

ernseized by the State of California and that their lega

right to effect the seizure is open to question. I. said I

could not give him more definite information because we

are awaiting word on the specifie statutory authority for

the solzure.

He said that in view of this situation ho wil

proceed on the

premise that the arms will probably be

returned

will continue efforts to arrange the exporta-

stir on costa that the sere me ca see nate an

it might be well for him to check on the current

climate there.

He said he would.

5.

He claims that he now hos DR agicement to import

the arms and that ihe guestlon of re-export to Venezuela

has been abandoned.

G.

He will phone on 6 April to see if we have further

information.

MEMORADUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Communication from AVBANG, 29 March 1965

AMBING (A) phoned (collect) from Puerto Rico

on 29

Narch 1965.

that the seizure

of arms being

manufactured for his organization by the ERQUIAGA Nanu-

Incturing Company in the Los Angeles area of California

was very damaging to his plans.

He said there sere some

493 submachine guns being manufactured by this company.

20

of these are for replacements for possibly defective guns.

He said each weapon is marked with a special mark and a

serial number which will make them attributable to his

organization.

He further said that the kuns were paid for

except for $9000. Erquinga left California about a month

ago with the job unfinished, and A sald that they had been

negotiating with Erquiaga's partner.

He did not give the

name of this individual.

He said that there was some ques

tion as to how much was

owed

had

on the arms, but that the partner

agreed

on the

$9000 figure.

2. A asked if we could arrange to have the arms released.

3.

I said that I would have to look into the legal

aspects of the

problem since the question of the title

the charges under which they were confiscated would have to

be clarified.

I pointed out to A that if the title had not

yet passed to him despite his payments, and if the charges

under

which

the arms were seized are valid, he might have no

other recourse

than a civil suit against the Erquiaga Company

to recover the money paid.

A was very insistent that he must have those specific

arms because of

the markings and the importance of the

psychological effect that these would create.

5.

I asked how long he would be in Puerto Rico and he

said he would

remin a week or ten days.

I told him

that !

could not give him

an answer at

this time,

and it was agreed

he would phone me again on Thursday, 1 April.

6.

Immediately after this conversation, I contacted

Mr. Mayo Stunz in 00,

who agreed to query his Los Angeles

office

immediately to find out the legal status of the

seizure.
