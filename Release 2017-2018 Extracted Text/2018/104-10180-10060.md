24 March 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: COperational Meetings with Nonolo Ray

1, Manolo Ray arrived in Washington, D.C., by air
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 20 March 1967 on a personal
business trip. At the request of AMBADGER he phoned the
writer and we met for approximately 1} hours in the bar
of the Hotel Ambassador in downtown Washington, This
meeting was followed by a luncheon meeting on 21 March
at the Occidental Restaurant. Ray returned to San Juan
on 22 March. The following are the highlights of our
conversations. :

a. Ray claims he has "lost access” with 1)
"the MI€§ pilot whom he had previously reported
,/ 28,2 defection target. He no longer has any
means of contacting him or of knowing his
present whereabouts or attitude,

b. He claimed he does not have any
direct comminication--or access--to any
significant military or government officials
in the Castro regime.

c. He still maintains his half hour radio
broadcast over Puerto Rican radio stations, This
program is prepared by his people and the radio
time donated so the cost is minimal,

d, Although he maintains contact with
active members of his "movement" they have no
present or projected plans for "action" except
in the propaganda field.

e. His business in the prefabricated
housing field is progressing satisfactorily.
He has obtained private financing to start a
7 prefab plant in Santo Domingo and recently

visited Panama where the prospects are good.

2. Future Plans:

a, Ray mentioned that his organization

_ plans to send a representative to Mexico City
- before the end of March to talk to Gustavo

Arcos’ sister who recently left Cuba, Ray is

Q- PH QT"



&

-2-

anxious te do everything possible to assist
Arcos in obtaining his freedom but admitted
he had no commo or means of making contact
with him in prison,

\ b. Ray is interested in expanding his
* propaganda radio broadcasts. He spoke in teras
of ronting timo on a U.S, short wave station
to beam broadcasts to Cuba, This would be
done at his own expense, He also mentioned
; \that during Roid's former administration in
j/ the Dominican Republic he had been promised
\ a site and permission to sot up a short wave
station for Cuban broadcasts. He may explore
this possibility with Balaguer's present
government during one of his business trips
to the D.R, I suggested he sound out other
stations in L.A, to see if he could get some
free time and replay for his Puerto Rican
_ material and have since mailed him via
: ‘ AMBADGER’a. list of stations in L,A, who are
\ known to have accepted and used other Cuban
a exile tape broadcasts. At my suggestion he
! prepared a brief outline of what he would
like to do in the radio/propaganda field
and what he would hope to accomplish.

3. Ray mentioned that he thought someone should
utilize Pardo Llada, who now lives and works on a
newspaper in Cali, Colombia, in propaganda activity

against Castro.

4. Ho did not ask or hint for any financial
assistance for his organization,

5, We discussed briefly the Olympic Games to be held
in Winnipeg, Canada, this summer, AMBADGER had asked him
to bring up the subject. I told him in essence that we
were not interested in inducing the defection of any
athletes but that if he received any information indicating
that any of the Cuban officials attending the games might
be disaffected we would be interested in checking out any

loads.

In general Ray was as usual pleasant, friendly
and talkative, It is evident that he is now concentrating
on earning a living for himself and his family. However,

at the same time ho maintains a keen interest ir Cuban

developments; hope to maintain somewhat of a namo for
Aincelf apd Sts orgasdartion in oxile circles by a
limited amount of propaganda activities and stands
ready and willing to help in any major plans if and
when they should ever materialize.

7. Regular contact will be maintained with Ray
in Puerto Rico by AMBADGER who Ray speaks highly of and
is pleased with the handling arrangement.

25 October i966

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meetings with Manolo Ray, San Juan, Puerto Rico
13 and 15 October 1968

MIG-21--Defecting Pilot--et al.

1, In lengthy discussions on this point it developed
that Ray hasbeen unable to obtain any more pertinent infor-
mation since he first called the matter to AMBADGER's
attention almost two months ago. Tho basis of the "Mig
Plot" is a tip he received from an inside contact which was
brought to him by “someone exiting Cuba. Ray considers the
inside contact reliable but prefers not to identify him,
Ray has not been able to determine if the inside contact
4s personally in contact, or can arrange contact, with the
Mig Pilot who reportedly is fed up with the situation In
Cuba and plans to defect with his airplane whenever he has
an opportunity. The "tip" Ray received was to this effect
4.c., that there is a Mig Pilot who is disenchanted and
plans to defect with his plane. One point Ray was specific
on was that the plane was described as “one of the smaller
Migs" and according to Ray it is not a Mig-21.

2, After Ray's original contacts with AMBADGER on this
subject (wherein the plane was apparently erroneously
identified as a MIG-21) Ray claims he sent a message to the
inside contact requesting. the complete details-we had asked
for. He has received no reply. In response to my request
at the meeting on 13 October 1966 he told me at our subsequent
meeting on 15 October that he attempted to reach his inside
contact by phone but was unsuccessful. He was urged to
continue until he reached the party and to obtain as much
detail on this matter as possible so we could hopefally
clarify the situation, fe assurred me he would follow-through
on this and report to AMBADGER, (It seemed pretty obvious to
me after two discussions with Ray on this subject that he has
no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on
the "Mig Plot" and consequently may never be able to verify
the original "tip" and obtain further details,



+2-

3. apy cvcui f outlined fer nim in general the
U.S, Government interest in obtaining a modern version of
the MIG-21 and the financial and other rewards available
to a pilot who would bring one out. I emphasized that ‘any
activity along this line would have to be strictly Ray's
and the JURE's operation and done through his contacts
and sources reiterating again that therefore it was essential
that he confirm the plane, model, pilot, etc. reported to
him to determine if the operation was feasible.

4. We spent sometime discussing his "image" both
inside Cuba and with the exiles. He agreed that at the
present time it could hardly be lower and something rather
dramatic was needed to improve it. We both agreed that if
he could pull off a successful operation to defect a MIG-21
pilot with his plane it would do much to restore his and-
the JURE's name and prestige.

5. Although Ray is obviously far removed from the
action agent (the pilot), if such exists, the idea of the
operation intrigues him and he will undoubtedly do everything
he can to stimulate some action. Any further information
developed by him will be forwarded to us through AMBADGER. ~

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY
—_

1, The following are the highlights of meetings held
with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto, Rico, on 13 and 15
October 1966, The matter of the possible defection of a
MIG-pilot previously reported by RAY has been covered in
a@ separate memorandum:

Personal Situation:

a. RAY has an engineering and planning office
in San Juan which he shares with Emilio Guede,
a personal friend and JURE colleague who is in the
publicity business, RAY said he just signed a
contract for the planning of a commercial develop-
ment site in San Juan, from which he will realize
several thousand dollars profit, His principal
(and pet) project is the promotion and attempt to
raise through private funds the financing of a
plant to mass produce low-cost prefabricated housing
designed by him, He claims with an investment of
$200,000 he can mass produce prefabricated homes to
sell for $3,000 which would be ideal for Puerto
Rico's needs,

Recent Trip to Santo Domingo:

b, RAY said his recent trip to Santo Domingo
was strictly for business purposes. He hopes to
start a small project in Santo Domingo to produce
prefabricated housing, The small project he has
in mind can get underway with an expenditure of
$80,000, which he feels confident can be raised
in Santo Domingo, He said he naturally talked with
some people in the government about Cuba and the
JURE, but that the government must become stronger
and more confident before there would be any possi-
bility of obtaining their assistance~-or blessing--
in conducting any activities against Cuba,

MIG-21, Defecting Pilot, et al.

¢. This matter has been covered in a separate
memorandum, -

SECHET



SECRET

Internal Contacts,

d. One gets the impression that RAY lives
somewhat removed from the actual realitiesa the
Cuban internal situation, He has a tendency to
compare the internal situation today with that
which existed in Batista's time when he (RAY) was
one of the leaders of the 26th of July underground
resistance movement in Habana, RAY maintains .
direct personal contact with many new arrivals
seeking asylum both in Puerto Rico and the U.S,
and also undoubtedly receives a certain amount of
general information and gossip from other JURE
contacts and supporters, He claims to have many
friends and former associates inside, which is
probably true, but does not have any regular or
secure means to communicate with them. It appears
obvious that these friends and contacts are not
working together, if at,all, and that he has no
cohesive resistance group or force as such inside.

I questioned him about several personalities
such as Carlos Franqui, Pedro Miret, Emilio Aragones,
and others, He had no specific information at all
on their activities in recent months but said he
“could get it if you want it." In summary on this
point, it would appear that RAY and the JURE main-
tain no regular contact with any internal "supporters";
that he undoubtedly still has many former friends
and supporters inside but just what they would do-~
or how far they would go--to support him is a moot
question,

JURE Propaganda Activities,

e. The JURE, Manolo RAY, Emilio Guede, and
others, have a half-hour weekly program which is
carried on 4 different Puerto Rican radio stations
between 6:30-7:30 PM each Sunday. This program,
which is taped in advance, features commentaries on
news and events in Cuba, interviews with recently
arrived refugees, and other items of current interest-
regarding Cuba. The program is composed without cost
and all radio time on the 4 stations is donated free

of charge.



Future Plans,

€. RAY is a man who is relaxed, is now engaged

in making a legitimate livelihood for himself, his
wife and three children but still seriously dedi-
cated and motivated towards seeking the overthrow
of the Castro government. He has a realistic outlook
to a considerable degree, although as mentioned in
paragraph d., above, his viewpoints on the reality
of the internal situation in present day Cuba are

saiae somewhat naive. As an experienced resistance organizer
and fighter in tho 2Gth of July movenent against
Batista, he knows the value of propaganda in preparing
the general populace for resistance. He also knows
that propaganda is useless and counterproductive
without follow-up positive results, He speaks of
continuing his local radio broadcasts (which he
readily admits are useful only to maintain some
spirit amongst the oxiles for possible future use),
and at ‘Some later date--he has no tinetable--hopes :
to obtain facilities in Venezucla, Puerto Rico, or
some other site where he can beam broadcasts into Cuba,
His intention being to follow-up the broadcasts with
action. He speaks again of clandestine entry into
Cuba himself to contact sources within, prove to
people that there is a resistance movement, and to
form a nucleus for lat action, He openly admits
the blunder of his last “publicized” return and that
if it is done again it must be conpletely clandestino
and unannounced, He seems to have no fear of returning
and claims he still has plenty of friends who would
hide and help him. He made an off-hand reference to
the Agency furnishing him assistaace to enter clan-
destinely at some future date, He was told that his
sources in Miami surely knew of several"family run”
operations which could take him successfully to Cuba
if and when he was ready to return,

Financial Situation,

g. -RAY made no request for financial assistance
and from all indications is doing fairly well in his
local business,

about two weeks and said he would visit JURE representatives

with AMBADGER who will be vacattoning in the U.S. at that
time and hopefully they will be able to get together with
the writer while in D.C, In any event, RAY obviously likes,
respects and accepts AMBADGER as our yo-between in San Juan
and I believe he will keep AMBADGER posted on most of his
activities,

3. Manolo RAY, as exiles go, certainly seems like one
of the better of the lot and contact on the scene by AMBADGER
on a regular basis should be adequate to keep up with his
activities. Occasional contact by an Agency staff officer,
however, could be useful in keeping AMBADGER's relationship
fully alive.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

JF&E

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY,

1. During a brief TDY stopover at Headquarters on 23 August 1966,
QUSPORT-I said he had talked with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto Rico
on 22 August. According to QUSPORT-1, RAY had no additional pertinent
information concerning his alleged inside contacts or his recent meeting
with Garcia Bango in Madrid, Spain. RAY continues to insist that he has
inside support in Cuba and contacts who are anti-regime and prepared
to assist him when needed. He did not reveal to QUSPORT-1, however,
who the people were or where they are located.

2. RAY told QUSPORT-1 that he wanted very much to see the writer
concerning a delicate operational matter. When pressed by QUSPORT-1
RAY said he had access to a MIG pilot in Cuba who was ready and anxious
to leave Cuba and was willing to fly out a MIG aircraft. RAY did not
mention the name or location of the pilot or the model MIG aircraft he was
flying, Neither did he discuss his ways and means of communication with
the pilot and how he had determined the pilot's intentions to defect with
his airplane. RAY told QUSPORT he wanted to discuss the matter with the
writer, He admitted that a MIG aircraft might not now have as much value
to the U.S. because of the recent access to a MIG-21 in Isreal but that it
would have tremendous propaganda value if a Cuban pilot defected and
brought out a MIG. He said he particularly wanted to discuss the matter
with the writer because if the operation were successful he did not want
Manuel Artime and the MRR or any other exile group taking credit. He
wanted to make sure that he and his group received all the propaganda
advantage which he would in turn exploit internally as further evidence to
his supporters inside that the JURE was active on the island, RAY in the
latter part of the conversation on this subject when he learned QUSPORT-1
was coming to Washington the following day, asked him to check with the
writer to determine if it was OK for him (RAY) to discuss this subject with
AMBADGER. (AMBADGER is the man who was recently introduced to RAY
in San Juan by Harry Mahoney as the man who would insure that any
information RAY wanted passed to the Agency would reach them.) QUSPORT
told RAY that if he did not receive a phone call from him before the evening
of 20 August he should give AMBADGER all the details,

Der 239218



I told QUSPORT to phone RAY and assure him that [ wanted
him to pass all the details to AMBADGER even though according to
QUSPORT-I's arrangement this was not accessary. QUSPORT-1 was
unable, however, to reach RAY by phone during the afternoon of

20 August.

4. About 8 p.m, on 20 August I received a collect phone call
from AMBADGER from San Juan. AMBADGER was very excited and
said he had to see me right away. Alter he settled down a bit he told
me he had just left RAY and his two locc! lieutenants Emilio GUEDE
and Arturo VILLAR (the so-called triumvirate of the JURE), He said
RAY had contacted him and the four of them discussed the possibility
of defecting a Cuban MIG pilot and having him bring out his plane. In.
essence and from what I could discuss over the phone the details were
substantially the same as those given to me by QUSPORT-I earlier in
the day. AMBADGER said he needed my guidance right away and
further urged me to come to San Juan to discuss the matter with RAY

"WHG was pressing AMBADGER to see me. He said he had agreed to see

RAY latter that night, Itold AMBADGER I could not make the trip in
the next few days and that further there were a few basic facts I needed
to convince me that RAY really had the potential to pull off the operation,
I told AMBADGER to see RAY later that evening and to try and determine
the following:

a. Name of the MIG pilot.
b. Military field where he is stationed.
c. Type MIG he flys.

d. RAY's commo if any with the pilot.

e, Estimated timing for the defection, i. e.. has the pilot
indicated he was ready to defect and awaiting instructions,

etc,

I asked AMBADGER to phone me if he could develop any further
information, AMBADGER phoned Mr. Mahoney on the afternoon of

24 August to report he had attempted to obtain further details from RAY
following his conversations with the writer but that RAY had replied he
did not know the name of the pilot orother details of the operation. {See
Mr. Mahoney's merino attached)

S. As soon as time permits I plan a short trip to San Juan to see
AMBADGER and to sit down with RAY and try and clear up many of the
obvious questions concerning his Madrid/Cuban internal contacts and
the MIG pilot. :

1 tely 2036 hours on 23 August 1966
pce HC called se to report t he had just
recetved a call from AMBADGER fron San Juan, Puerto Rico.
AMBADGER had a report from AMBANG that agexts of his inside
Cuba were prepared to fly a HIG 21 to the United States.
asked AMBADGER for more information but AMBANG
claiged that he did not have any additional detatla. (In
view of ANBANG’s previous reluctance to source his information
theres always a certain skepticism abo.t AMBANG's claims
Of accomplishaents.) told AMBANGER to find out +
from AMBANG the who, where, why, what. when. and how and to
report Dack. AMBANG stated that he did not have this ine
formation but they planned to go ahead with the operation.
Williamson told him that if a Cuban pilot wanted to fly a
MIG 21 to the U.S. we could do nothing to stop hin.

2. At 1400 hours on this date AMBADGER called ne to
= report that he had discunsed suggestions with
AMBANG who had replied that he honestly didn’t know the name
of the pilot or the details of the operation. In short, he
had been tnformed by @ contact of hia in Cuda that sono of
his people were going to steal a MIG 21. {AMBADGER com-
Rented that AMBANG did not appear to be evasive or reluctent
to discuss the satter but apparently didn't know the details.)
In any event, AMBANG atated that they vere going ahead with
the operation and planned to "do some damage” defore they
loft and AMBADGER asked for my approval, 1 told\AMBADGER
that I couldn't approve anything like that and thought that
the chance of losing the aircraft outweighed the possible
gain, I suggested that if they were going abead with the
operation anyvay it would be of more value to just get the
aircraft. AHBADGER replied that AMBANG appeared adamant in
this respect and wanted to be certain that 1f the operation
vas successful that he be allowed to take all tae credit for
it. IT replied that if in fact he was resporsidie for the
operation he could nave all the credit,

it + FT have called Lt. Col. Norman H, Stuzer, Yellow
Bande Officer, U.8. Air Porce, extension 3207 and informed
his that there ia the “possibility” of a MIG 31 pilot, de-
fecting to the U.3, in his aircraft, He in turn hes

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: IDEN A

1. IDEN A telephoned IDEN B on 15 June 1966
who asked hin to como to Hadrid as soon as possible
so that he could be back in San Juan before the 25th
of June. The implication was that IDEN A should be
back in San Juan in time to talk to a PBRUMEN who
was with the PDRUMEN delegation to the Tenth Central
American and Caribbean Games, (IDEN C, was a
delegate to the Games).

2. IDEN A and IDEN B developed a plan that
involved tzo action agents already inside PBRUMEN.
One was to assassinate AMTNUG either by rifle fire
or resote controlled radio activated explosives
while the other agent was to ostablish a military base
in the ‘central part of PBRUMEN. Station
apoke with IDEN A who reported that he hee a
would topple within the next few months and that
he already had a group inside PBRUMEN.

3. IDEN A was interviewed upon his return
to San Juan where he reported that be did not have
any firm evidence that ANTIWUG would topple within
the next fev months but only that he intuitively believed
that AMTHUG's downfall was imminent. le kased this
on reports that things were getting worse in PERUHEN
and that the people were ready to revolt. ile also
based it on the tact that he now has two action agents
‘of the wase caliber as AMLASI! tnside PBRUMEN who are
ready to do his bidding.

4, TDEN A's ‘agents’ inside PHYUMNEN are probably
IDEN C, who might cooperate with IDTK R but not necessarily



-2-

eith IDEN A. Further there 1s no firm evidence tha®
caee eee agaleds ihe presuut regiae in PBKUKEN. IDEN D
is another possible contact. Again, other than soa
unsupported allogations there is no independent

firm evidence that IDEN D is anti-regine.

5. IDEN A also claimed in) that
IDEN E had dont him a aessage and that he wae congidered
a potential ally. Ke explained this in San Juan
by sayang that during a preso conference his name
had been mentioned and that IDEN E replied that he
considered EDEN A to be his friend. IDEN A rationalized
feat 4f IDEN E had not wanted to indicate in sone way
that he vas “with” IDEN A he would have taken this

opportunity to blast hia.

6. I debriefed IDEN A on his Madrid trip and
intentions gererally before I introduced him to
AUBADCER/1.” I had first asked in if he would mind
reporting to us via a trusted PPRUKEN exile noe living
ja gan Juan and, after I bad identified AMEADGER/1, he
replied that he knew him and respected ard Liked hia,
Tee three of us had a mecting and it wan agreed that
THEN A would keep AMBADGER/1 complotely informed of
Aye plans and that AMRADGER/1 would conve7 them to
ge in PRPRIME. IDEN A refused to roveal tho
‘Sentities of bis agents inside PERUEN deapito stroug
pressure. flo also stated that IDEN F and 1o0h G would
aeeee tn know about his arrangement vith AMDADGER/2
reve ith KUDARX. IDEN F and IDEN G, together with
1DEN A, are the triuavirate of tho JURE.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with AMBANG-1, 28 April 1966

1. On_28 April 1966 the undersigned, using the name
Andrews. as Tn the past, contacted AMBANG-1 (201=2:19298) at
the Hotel Sheraton in San Juan, ‘Puerto Rico, The following
points were discussed, in addition to matters pertaining to
R projected meeting of Cuban exiles, covered in a separate d
memo,

a. AMBANG seemed much less aggressive than
when I used to talk to hima year and a half ago.
He seemed dispirited about the exiles and their
chances of ever doing anything to settle affairs
in Cuba.

b. The exiles do not seem to have any plans
for doing much of anything. AMBANG-1 agreed that
the overthrow of Castro will probably come from tho
inside, and that the exiles will have little
influence on the move that accomplishes it, AMBANG-1
feels this is not all to the bad since. as ho says,
there are a number of good men in Cuba in important :
posts who have gotten sucked bit by bit into support
of communism but are really not communists, I told
him I believed the US would probably be willing to
deal with such persons if they achieved the overthrow
of the regime and that the US would probably oppose
a wave of vengeance against “decent revoluttonaries",
I told him this because I thought there wns some
chance he might spread 1t about and the word might
get back to “decent revolutionaries” in Cuba,

c¢. In general, AMBANG-1 had less information
on the purge situation than I did. He told me that
relatives of Gustavo ARCOS (201-205568) in Puerto Rico
had been in telephone contact with the family inside

SECKET



-2-

Cuba about 25 April, that Arcos was as of that
date still in prison but the charges against him
were thin and {it was hoped he would be out in a
few days, (This means there was at least one
more telephone call than we knew of previously,
and this has probably served to increase the
pressure on Arcos), I asked AMBANG-1 if his
contact with Arcos in late 1964 might not have
been responstbie for the arrest. AMBANG-~1 said
he did not think so. We talked some about the
symbolic value of the Arcos family and I expressed
a strong interest in Arcos's welfare and in getting
the latest news about him. I did this on the
chance that AMRANG-1 might assume Arcos had been
cur agent and we were concerned about him. I do
not know if he will actually construe my remark in
this way, however, but it seemed like an opening
to use an important exile channel as a possible
deception mechanism, AMBANG said he does not
believe there is any truth to the charge of financial
dishonesty levelled against Arcos.

d. Rene RODRIGUEZ Cruz (201-224329): AMBANG-1
regards him as a compulsive, capable of doing harm
to anyone, including Fidel Castro, AMBANG-1 knows
him quite well but does not know his associate,
Carlos Laplace, who’ shows up in Mexico from time to
time.

I raised the matter of Rene RODRIGUEZ merely to
sound AMBANG out, but it may be he thinks we have
some special interest in him.

e. About Osmani CLENFYEGOS (201=270164), AMBANG
stated he was a member of the PSP in the middle 1950's.
He is a competent architect but otherwise a person of
limited. capacity. He is not a member of the inner
circle of the Old Guard PSP and never was. He got
involved with the PSP out of opportunism, he is a
schemer, self seeker and very unreliable,

f.’ I told AMBANG I had heard Emilio Aragones had
been arrested. AMBANG was surprised and said he would
inform me if he heard anything about it. I raised
this to supplement rumors I am trying to spread through
exile mechanisms.

§



&. AMBANG stated that Pedro Miret (201-169120)
is a man of slight capacity who would not be to
upset of the Castro regime fell so long as he did
net get his throat cut in the progress. I expressed
a great deal of interest in Miret, asking especially
why he should have been selected to make two recent
trips.to Moscow. AMBANG did not have any idea. I
raised the subject of Miret, again, to put him into
the exile rumor mill as a person of special interest
to the US, and thus to flesh out some of the other
parts of our program.

h. Armando Hart (201-222675), according to
AMBANG, does ‘not have the qualities of an admints~-
trator but he is very good at situating himself
politically, organizing politically and, in general,
wheeling and dealing. He is NOT under his wife's

“thumb, as many say. AMBANG regards Hart as a much
more decent person than Aragones and to be well placed
in Aragone's old job because he does not have
notoriously close connections with“any of the

» personalities or factions within the 26th of July
crowd but gets along with them all.

i. Concerning the differences between the city ;
and sierra fighters in the 26th of July, AMBANG stated
they are real and that the city group fought and
suffered much more.

j.. AMBANG believes this is not the time for the
US or exiles to make menacing gesttues against Cuba, i
for this would merely provide Castro with distractions
from internal problems and perhaps enable him to rally

popular support.

2, I believe that later in the summer it might be a good
idea to have another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exile
thinking, and feeding more deception thoughts,

Dirute on 15 June 1966 who asked him to come to

Madrid as soon as possible so that he could be back

tn San Juan before the 25th of June. The implication

was that the Subject should be back in San Juan

in tige to talk to a cuban who was with the Cuban delegation
to the Tenth Central American and Caribbean Games. (Jorge
GARCIA-EANGO Dirube, Rafae@l's brother, was a delegate

to the Canes.)

2. The Subject and Rafael GARCIA BANCO developed
a plan that inyolved tvo action agents already inside
Cuba, ne was to assassinate Fidel Castro Ruz. either
by rigle fire or remote controlled rad{o activated
explosives witle the other agent was to establish a
military base in the ‘central part of Cuba’. Station
spoke with the Subject who reported that h
believed Fidel CASTRO would topple within the next few
months and that he already had a group inside Cuba.

1. The Subject telephoned Rafael GARCIA-BANGO i
i
i
!

3. The Subject was interviewed upon his return
to San juan where he reported that he did not have any !
firm evidesce that CASTRO would topple within the next f
few montts but only that he intuitively believed that ~
Castro's downfall was imminent. He based this on
reports that things were getting worse in Cubs and that
the people were ready to revolt. He also based it on
the fact that he now bas two action agents ‘of the
same cAliter as AMLASH inside Cuba’ who are ready to
do his bidding.

4, The Subject's ‘agents’ inside Cuba ere probsbly
Jorge GARCIA RANGO Dirube, who might cooperate with his



-LLANUSA had not wanted to indicate in sone

brother but not necessarily with the Subject. Further
there is no firm eviderce that Jorge is against the present
regime in Cula. Aldo SANTAMARIA, Chief of the Cuban

Navy, is another possible contact. Again, other than

some unsupported allegations there|is no independent

firm evidence that SANTAMARIA is anti-regime.

3. The Subject also claized in Madrid that
Jose LLANUSA Gobel Minister of Education and leader
of the Cutan delegation to the Tenth Games. had sent
bim @ message and that he was considered a potential ally.
He wxplained this in San Juan by saying that during
® press conference his name had been mentioned and that
LLANUSA replied that he considered the Subject to be
his friend. The Subject rationalized that if
y that he

was, with’ the Subject he would have taken this
opportunity to blast hin.

4. I debriefed the Subject on his Madrid trip
and intentions generally before I introduced him to
AMBADGER/1. I had first asked hin if he would nind
reporting to us via a trusted Cuban exile now living
in San Juan and, after I had identified AMBADGER/1]. he
replied that he knew him and respected and liked him.
The three of us had a meeting and it was agreed that
the Subject would keep AMBADGER/1 completely informed
of his plans and.that AMBADGER/1 would convey thea
to me in Washington. The Subject refused to reveal
the identities of his agents inside Cuba despite
strong pressure. He also stated that Dmilio GUEDE
and Arturo VILLAR would have to know about his
arrangement with AMBADGER/1 and with CIA. GUEDE and
VILLAR, together with the Subject, are the triumvirate

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: AMBADGER-1

1, On this date, Subject called me from
San Juan, Puerto Rico to report on his meeting with
AMBANG-1 on 1% July.( AMBANG-1 remained adamant concerning
his refusal ‘to reveal the names of bis sources inside
Cuba. However, AMBADGER-1 bekieves that AMBANG-1
ia in a better frame of mind than previously and he needs
some added push to reveal the names.

2. AMBADGER suggested that Growery come to
Puerto Rico to give AHMBANG-1 that added push. AMBADGER=-1
said that AMBANG-1 speaks fondly of Growory and he
believes that Growery might convince ANBANG-l to reveal
the namos. Alternatively, AMBANG-1 and AMBADGER-1 could
come to Washington, D.C. for discussions with Growory.

3. 1 agreed to write ABADGER-1 the details
of processing his wife's citizenship. AMPADGER~1
wanta to process his wife's citizenship in Montreal.
I also agreod to look into the matter of transmitting
money to lis mother in Cuba at a rate of exchange
more favorable than one to one.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD :

SUBJECT: Manolo

I talked to AMBADGER at 0800 (Home 766-3337) and
told him that both “The Engle” (Williamson) and I
agreed that our position was firm. We would not give
Manolo REY any support or assistance until he
cooperated with us fully by giving us the names of his
sources. I told ANBADGER that’he should be firm with
REY and likened it to a blind date, i.e., it could
be a beautiful romance if both sides cooperated but it
would be a very bad date if ke wanted it to be a
one sided affair. AMBADGER is having lunch with REY
this afternoon and will write me the results by airmail.

contain the following information from sources of varying
reliability regarding Subject.

2, Manuel RAY Rivero wae born on 13 June 1924 in Hevana,
Cuba of a middle-class family, RAY attended the University of
Havana, where he received a degree in engineering, After graduation,
he worked 99 a civil engineer in Havana until 1943, when he wae
awarded a scholarship to the University of Utah in recognition of
hia outstanding work; however, he did not receive o degree becau:
of failure to submit a required thesis, He later became president.
of the Havana Society of Civil Engineers end worked on the Hotel
Hilton projec? in Havana until 1957,

3, RAY wae unknown yoliticaily until April 1957 when he
Joined the anti-BATISTA Movimiento de Resistencia Civica (MRC,
Civic Resistance Movement), By August 1957 he had become the
nccretary-general of the MRC in Havana Province and wae a
member of the provincial directing committee of the "26th of July
Movement" headed by Fidel CASTRO, and was reoponsible for
coordination between the two grouse. Under RAY's leaderalhip the
MRC was the targest anc most important organization eupporting
the "2cth of Jcly Movement" during the last two years of the revolution,
Although the MRC concentrated mostly on prozaganda and logistic
support, tt did organize its own sabotage and action groupe in late

1953,

6-FOREHR DSSEE

Works in the provisional government of Manucl URRUTIA, which
post he held tor ntout ten montne, Because of his work in the
revolution sad hie outstanding performance as Minister of Public /
Worke, RAY reportedly acquired a considerable yo; ulor following

in Cuba,

$. RAY strongly supported the stated alma of CASTRO'e
revolution, but he reportedly became inczeneingly disturbed about
Communist infiltretion of the government, After the arrest aad
imprisonment of Huber MATOS tn Octover 1959, RAY made his
concern known to CASTRO ond was subsequently dismiosed sad
rerlaced by a Communist, Between the time of his dismissal sad
October 1960, when he exfili rated to the United States, RAY devoted
hia time to the orgenizetion of the Movimiento Revoluciona rio de
Pueblo (MRP, Peo;le'e Revolutionary Movement), an anti-CASTRO
group, Under RAY's leaderehip the MRP became ne of the most
important aati-CASTRO movements at that time,

6 After his departure from Cuba, RAY spent some time
in the United States, and then went to work in Pverto Rico on public
works projects sponsored by the Puerto Rican government. During
that time, he remained in contact with other Cuban eaile leaders
and engaged in Joint opesations with them against the CASTRO segime.
RAY cid not like many of the other lead becauee he believed
they did not trust him, In fact, many of the Cuban exiles were
reported to have stated that serving under RAY wae nothing more
than "Fidelism without Fidel Thia ted RAY to the decigion that a
new revolutionary organ was needed, In the summer of 19t2 he
propoeed that a military Justa be formed in which each of the different
exile groups would be represeated and have a vote on the junta’s
activities, He believed this would give more unity to their cause
and insure against blatant failures, He was highly critical of both
the invasion attempt of 1961 and with himeelf for giviag his azproval
to the operation, RAY felt that his new organization would be able
to avoid similar failures, The aew group was lormed ot that time
and was called the Juata Revolucionaria Cubana (JURE, Cubaa
Revolutionary Junta), :

7, Since the founding of the JURE, RAY has kept bia oatie
CASTRO activitins within its framework, During the last two yeara
he-has devoted most of his ettention toa possible infiltration of

post he held tor ebout ten montns, Because of his work in the
Fevolition aad his outeianding performance as Minister of Public ,
Works, RAY reportedly acquired a considerable 90; ular following

in Cuba,

RAY cid not like many of the other leaders because he believed
they did not trust him, In fact, many of the Cuban exiles were
reported to have otated that serving under RAY waa nothing more
than “Fidellsm without Fidet", This led RAY to the decision thet a
new revolutionary organ was needed, Inthe aummer of 19t2 be
froposed that a milltary Juata be formed in which each of the different
exile groups would be re;reseated nad have a vote on the junta's
activities, He believed thie would give more unity to their cause
aod ingure againet blatant failures, He was highty critical of both
the invasion attempt of 1961 and with himeelf for giviag his azproval
to the operstion, RAY felt that hia acw organization would be able
to avoid similar failures, The ew group was lormed at that time
and wae called the Juata Revoluctonaria Cubana (JURE, Cubea
Revolutionary Junta). .

‘SOURCE:

Manuel Ray Rivero, leader of the Junta Revolucionaria Cubana
(JURE, Taban Revolutionary Junta), will arrive in Miami from
Puerto Rico on 31 July 1965 to meet with the Miami council of

JURE.

Field Comment; The position of. JURE within the Cuban exile
Conmunrty was weakened after Ray failed to keep his widely-
publicized promise to land in Cuba by 20 May 1964, Since then
the organization has been relatively inactive, Recontly Ray
has been making an effort to again establish a strong JURE, On
22 May 1965 he gave a lecture in Miami to JURE delegates from
Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, in which he stressed the need to
raise money for the organization, The feeling of some members
who attended the lecture was that it was rather late to start
asking people to contribute moncy to the JURE, A meeting of
delegates of the JURE was held in Tampa, Florida, from 3 to

5 July 1965 to discuss the program and future plans of the JURE,
On 5 and 6 July Ray held discussions with representatives of

the Segundo Frente Nacional del Escambray (SFNE, Second National
Front of the Escambray), concerning a unification of the two

organizations,

REVERENCE: LA 453-65, dated 2 June 1965

1, Further to cur telephone conversation of 16 June
we should like to clarify that whereas it is true that ve
had, and to a limited degree have, contact with Manuel Ray,
who apparently bought some of the arns impounded hy the
California authorities in the Zrquiaga plant, we are in
no way connected with Subject. Ray purchased these weapons
strictly on his own initiative. He was neither cuunselled
to do so by us nor have we ever referred his to Erquiaga.
Furthermore this Agency has no connection whatever with
any of the individuals mentioned in the paragraph 1 listing
ef reference, What little contact we maintain with Ray is
Sainiy within tho context of our goneral interest in keeping
abreast of Cuban exile activities. Our interest in Erquiaga,
therefore, was in keeping with this general interest.

3, We aro most appreciative of your Los Angeles
office's efforts on our behalZ., Should the Foi query your
Los Angeles office about our interest and connections with
Subject 1% 12 suggested that they answer along the lines
set forth above. It is also requested that your office
continue to keep us apprised of the current developments

You will notice that the FBI in Los Angeles nas enquired if the
company or any of the individuals meant anything to us. We
will have to reply.

2. 1 sugg@est you advise Crimmins and that our reply
be to the effect that we are aware that the arms being manu-
factured by Ergiaga were destined for the JURE, that we have
been interested in monitoring the case as part of our responsi-

the Agency has no interest either in the individuals involved

MEMORANDUM FOR THS RECORD
SUBJECT: Conversation with AMBANG/1, 7 April 1968

J, Subject phoned (collect) from San Juan on the
morning of 7 April 1965. The undersigned,whom he calle
Antonelli, spoke with his. AMBANG/1 (A/1) wanted to know
whether we had any further information on the status of the
-legal-case arising fromthe seizure of the arms being
manufactured for him by the Krquiaga Manufacturing Company.

He was told that we had received further information ind'cating
thi the case was undertaken by the state authorities and

that there were some irregularities involved in the search
warrant. Under the circumstances, we plan to take no action
to interfere with the legal process since tt would appear that
the manufacturer has a very good case, and since federal
involvement with publicity hungry state authorities could lead
to totally counterproductive publicity and complications,

A/) said he understood and agreed. He asked how long the
matter might be delayed. He was advised that this would have
te be checked with the manufacturer's attorney, but since the
seizure took place, it would appear that the court would have
to take prompt action to rule on its legality. He was told
that a hearing was schediled for 6 or 7 April on the matter,

2. He said that he had checked with his man in Costa
Rico who had spoken with President Orlich and with Daniel
Oduber. They had advised that they cannot receive the arms
in Costa Rico at the present tine because of publicity and
scandal raised by the opposition. They are willing to consider
the matter Inter, A/1 said that the manufacturer had been
unable to Jocate in his files the original purchase order for
the arma which was gigned by Oduber. A/l said that he has a
signed copy in his possession. Hv was advised not to use this
without checking with Oduber since its use might hurt Oduber's
chances of winning the presidential elections. A/1 said he
vould not use this paper since he agreed that the friendship
of the PLN ie more important,even than the arms, which are the
key to hig current plans. He praised the PLN's past support
and said he did not want to risk losing this support.



3. A/1 said that negotiations with the Dominican
Government concerning the arms continue.

4. He said he would phone me on the week of 123 April
1965. :

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Phone Call from AMBANG, 1 April 1965 \

1. Subject phoned (collect) on 1 April to determine
what information I had arrived at concerning the seizure
of arms being made to his order by the ERQUIAGA Manufacturing
Company. \

2. © told him as far as we were able to determine
om the basis of incomplete information that the arms had
bech=seized by the State of California and that their legal
right to effect the seizure is open to question. I. said I
could not give him more definite information because we
are awaiting word on the specific statutory authority for
the seizure.

3. He said that in view of this situation he will
proceed on the premise that the arms will probably be
returned and will continue efforts to arrange the exporta-
tion.

4. I told him that the seizure had caused quite a
Public stir in Costa Rica, and while we did not have all
the facts, it might be well for him to check on the current
climate there. He said he would.

5. He claims that he now has DR agreement to import
the arms and that ihe questiun of re-export to Venezuela
has been’ abandoned.

G. He will phone on 6 April to see tf we have further
information.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Communication from AMBANG, 29 March 1965

1. AMBANG (A) phoned (collect) from Puerto. Rico
on 29 March 1965. He said that the seizure of arns being
manufactured for his organization by the ERQUIAGA Manu-
facturing Company in the Los Angeles area of California
was very damaging to his plans. He said there were some
493 submachine guns being manufactured by this company. 20
of these are for replacements for possibly defective guns.
He said each weapon is marked with a special mark and a
serial number which will make ‘them attributable to his
organization. le further said that the guns were paid for
except.for $9000. Erquiaga left California about a month
ago with the job unfinished, and A said that they had been
negotiating with Erquiaga's partner. He did not give the
name of this individual. He said that there was some ques-
tion as to how much was owed on the arms, but that the partner
had agreed on the $9000 figure.

2. A asked if we could arrange to have the arms released.

3. I said that I would have to look into the legal
aspects of the problem since the question of the title and
the charges under which they were confiscated would have to
be clarified. I pointed out to A that if the title had not
yet passed to him despite his payments, and if the charges
under which the arms Were seized are valid, he might have no
other recourse than a civil suit against the Erquiaga Company
to recover the money paid.

4. A-was very insistent that he must have those specific
arms because of the markings and the importance of the
psychological effect that these would create.

5. I asked how long he would be in Puerto Rico and he
said he would remain a week or ten days. I told him that [
could not give him an answer at this time, and it was agreed
he would phone me again on Thursday, 1 April.

6. Immediately after this conversation, I contacted
Mr. Mayo Stunz in 00, who agreed to query his Los Angeles
office immediately to find out the legal status of the
seizure. Ws

On 1 March 1965 Manuel Rivero, leader of the Junta Revolu-
cionaria Cubana (JURE, 2 may Revolutionary Junta), said that he
and his group have no plans for action against Cuba at the present
time. He and his group, according to Ray, have changed their
plans completely with regard to the fight against Communism in
Cuba. Ray believes that it would be almost impossible to use
gucrrilla tactics during the Castro régime; for this reason, he
believes it would be preferable to begin operating clandestinely
in the large urban centers and then slowly expanding operations

to the rural areas of Cuba,
