29 August 1962

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Suary of S/i Training and Issuance of Materials.

AGENT : AMLASH/1

PLACE : Paris, France

DATE : 17-22 August 1962

TRAINER:

1.

AMLASH/1 was instructed in S/w techniques by the under-

signed in a Paris Station safehouse on 17 and 18 August, and was

siven an Sid review in the final briefing session held in the hotel

Toon of Wallace A. Growery (Madrid Station C/O) on 22 August.

Instruction was given in the use of carbon writing system No. 15136

and in the use of liquid developer system No. 56638 .

The "scorch"

method of development was also demonstrated to A/1 as an alternate

system. A total of five hours was devoted to this instruction.

2. All, who was recruited a short time prior to coming to

Paris, was introduced to the idea of using sw by the undersigned

diring discussions held in Copenhagen. Although for security

considerations, he was akeptical at first about using such a means

of communication, he was without undue effort convinced that any

productive relationship depended upon his being able to communicate

with his c/O on a regular basis through. the medium of S/n letters

sent through normal mail channels.

It was apparent from his early

questions that he was unfamiliar with the principles of S/i and clandes-

tine communications in general. After further talks in Paris with

Growery on 16 Angust, A/i was fully prepared to arcept the concent

of S/ communications,, and arrangements were made for this instruction

to begin the following day.

The first training session on 17 August lasted a little

more than two hours, and was devoted to an explanation of the s/d

preparation of a letter containing S/. A/1 also prepared an S/w

letter of his own under the supervision of the undersigned. He

messaze and experienced only a little difficulty at first in remember-

ing all the steps in sequence necessary for the preparation of an S/W

message. He was generally attentive to the instruction given. How-

ever,

1n keeping with his terperment, he was a little impatient

during the preparation of the S/W message itself upon the cover

letter. At the end of this session, he demonstrated that he remembered

the basic steps in a satisfactory manner, particularly considering

that it was his first day in S/W Instruction.

The second period of instruction took place in the same

safehouse, lasting about two hours.

This session was

devoted to a

review of the Sid procedures and the preparation by A/1 of another

practice S/ letter. Following this, A/1 was

development of S/# messages, using the liquid developer No. 55538

the scorch systen of development was also demonstrated. A/1 was

impressed by the simplicity of the liquid developer and the immediate

reaction which it produced. The undersigned developed one message;

then h/1 was allowed to prepare the developer from its dry pill form

and to develop a second practice S/W message for himself. Followins

the period devoted to sw development, a general revien

communications was held, the basic points apparently being well-fixed

1n A/l's mind.

5. During the final fornal meeting with A/1 vil 22 August

with Growery and the undersigned participating, the latter gave A/1

& general review of all the S/i procedures

which were to be used

In his contact with KUBARK. He also was provided with the following

Items:

3. Two shoets of s/i carbon paper ( 10. 5681a)

Forty-seven pills of developer

C.

One tablet of writing paper provided by TSD and

known to be compatible with the carbon sheets.

D. 3 No. 2 pencils of French manufacture.

E.

One ball-point pen with water-resistant ink.

F.

Two accomodation addresses: one in Madrid for

regular ecatact; one in New Jork City for rapid

emergency contact (see attached S/i data sheet).

G. Appropriate indicators (see S/w data sheet)

It is noted that A/1 did not have a secure accomodation address in

PBRUMEN to give us at this time. He was told, however, that it was

imperative that he provide one for us by S/W letter within two weeks

of his return to PBRUMEN. This he stated he would do.

During the last S/w review, A/I was shown a photograph

of one of his practice messages which he had prepared.

He was quite

interested in seeing this, which served to illustrate a number of the

training points which had been covered during previous instruction.

Generally, A/1 was an interested pupil and it is believed that he

will be able to carry out the instructions in & proper manner. He

is quite security conscious, a factor which it is believed, will add

to his attempts to seek perfection in his S/i correspondence and

In the secure storage of his S/i materials when not in use.

It is

also known that A/1 practiced his S/W techniques in his hutel room

after leaving the 22 August meeting.

This is known because he had

an additional question to ask us at a brief meeting on 23 August.

It should also be noted that the TSD technician who

developed A/l's practice letters recommends that for best results,

all letters from A/1 be subjected to ammonia fuming before immersion

In the developer.
