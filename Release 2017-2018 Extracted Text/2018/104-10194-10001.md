PROFESSIONAL...

There's nothing outstanding ahout Tarasoff - just an ansrira joe trying to make

a llving and without, the anhition, energy, perspicalty to make use of a salenble

article: knowledge of Russian.

Physically he's sort of soli, tonis to be over

weight - he's about 588ntall, and about 190 in weight.

sas personality 1s on

the negative side, his manner dull.

Tarasoff was greatly irtorested in the possibility of sorking for the US Govern-

And he has about reached the end of the line

salary wise as a maintenance man or building succrintendent.

Tarasoff is will-

ing to work in D.C. but Insists on a GS 7 because he has to eupport a wife and

two children. He does not mind the sedentary aspects of Froject Detail I

doubt if he'd be interested in anything, that wasn't seirtary.

the other aspects of Detail

and I sould

think, from talki?? with him

would be quite able to handle a job on Detail.

He can crarciate - reads with

a great deal of ease.

Ris PHS I notive indicates he's

interested only in p/s -

this is not what he

told me; he is interested in US alss out he will to ofs id

I recormand tarasoff for a rs 7 on Project Detail.

Begend the

relatively. technical

aspect of producing transcriptions, which he'decomplishes with time-

liness,

accuracy and thoroughness, he strives to provide the Station

and Headquarters with an insight in depth on the local Soviet com

plement.

He does this capably, particularly when one understands

the limitations of his technical access.

His wife, a contract em-

ployee, assists him in the preparation of the technical product.

However, her over-all contribution goes beyond this, since Subject

and his wife work together in effort to distill the meaning of their

product in terms of personality assessment. They are uniquely well

adjusted to their deep cover circumstances, are of little burden

administratively to the Station, and are presently interested in

continuing their assignment in Mexico Clty indefinitely.

For your information, we have been advised by the

Mexico City Station that once

Nr. Tarasoff has retired

relationships, he will probably not be asked

to go into

any detail about his past cover jobs that would require

anyone to call upon these firms

past,

MEMORANDUM FOR: SI

SUBJECT

: Retirement Planning

Miess D.

1. The established policy of the Agency favors early retirement of

its employces who, as you know, are normally expected to retire when

they become eligible for a full annuity. The prospect of retirement

deserves serious thought and planning, and you should therefore know

that you will be eligible for retirement, according to our records,

during November, 1970.

2. Planning ahead can bring about, with each passing year, definite

progress toward.your.retirement goals.

The Agency is anxious to assist

you in planning for your retirement. It is even more important, as an

employee, that you begin now to plan for this occasion.

You deserve to know as much as possible about the general subject

of retirement and more specifically about the retirement policy itself.

your annuity, life and health insurance protection, opportunities for other

employment, Social Security benefits, and educational materials available

on the subject. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory

service should be made available to you at least five years prior to the date

of your eligibility.

4. You are requested to call the Brecutive Secretary of the Board,

Mr. Howard G. Phillips,

on extension 6972 to arrange an appropriate time

to discuss any plans you may have and benefits available to you upon

retirement.
