His team spirit and dedication are shown by the fact that on several
occasions, in. spite of advancing axe and recent illness, he spent long
hours in basco houses on livé-monitoring assignments. He will be
greatly missed when he retires in the near future.

As previously noted, this officer does not handle operational funds
or have supervisory responsibilities. lo has had no cover problems,
nor has he required any unusual administrative support, other than that
which is: to be expected in connection with his forthcoming retirement.

This officer has also been called ipon to transcribe material from :
audio operations, in addition to the telephone material which is his
normal assignment, He has also handled this well, although his advan-
cing age and less acate- hearing make this task much more difficult
for him..

re Ray Lexy i
Subject has continued to demonstrate a very hfgh level of
interest and competence in his work, Beyond the relatively. technical
aspect. of. produciag transcriptions, which hé!@ecomplishes with. time-
liness, accuracy and thoroughness, he strives to provide the Station
and Headquarters with an insight in depth on the local Soviet com-
plement, He does this capably, particularly when one understands
the limitations of his technical access. His wife, 9 contract em-
ployee, assists him in the preparation of the technical product.
However, her over-all contribution goes beyond this, since Subject
and his wife work together in effort to distill the meaning of their
product interms of personality. assessment. They are uniquely well
adjusted to their deep cover circumstances, are of little burden
administratively to the Station, and are presently interested in
continuing their assignment in Mexico City indefinitely,

+ Reads Russien rapidly and looks out for material of intercst to others as he
scans, Is adaptable and flexible and handles several different technical fields with
equal facility. Can tackle almost any subject without previous experience and turn out
ja good job. His native knowledge of Russian is of considerable benefit to the whole
section. Selects the. salient points fron masses of uséless or repetitive material with
Hintelligent Judgment, and compiled reports which are pointed and concise. Hia only
deficiency. of any consequence is the slight avkvardness and occasional lack of clarity
bis written English style. His English has inrroved considerably during the past two
ears, but sometimes the failure to use the most precise term or the right connective
complicates for the reader a conception vhich is verfectly clear to the writer.

its employees who, as you know, are normally expected to retire when
they become eligible for a full annuity. The prospect of retirement
deserves serious thought and planning. and you should thercfore know
that you will be eligible for retirement, according to our records,

during November, 1970.

2, Planning ahead-can bring about, with each passing year, definite
progress taward your. retirement goals, The Agency is anxious to assist
you in planning for your retirement. It is even more important, as an
employee, ‘that you begin now to plan for this occasion,

3. You deserve to know as much as possible about the gencral subject
of retirement and more specifically about the retirement policy itself,
your annuity, life and health insurance protection, opportunities for other
employment, Social Security benefits, and educational materials available
on the subject. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory
service should be made available to you at least five years prior to the date

of your eligibility.

4. You are requested to call the Executive Secretary of the Board,
Mr. Howard G. Phillips, ‘on extension 6872 to arrange an appropriate time
to discuss any plans you may have and benefits available to you upon
