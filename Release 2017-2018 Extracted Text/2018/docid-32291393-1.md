WEEKLY SUMMARY

DALLAS DIVISION

Re Dallas airtel to Bureau, 10/8/62.

RE: GENE LESLIE STOKES, ET AL

ITWP; ITWI

(DL 168-19)

On 10/16/62, PCI JAMES C. JACKSON advised STOKES had

not called him on Monday night (10/15/62) as per previous custom,

but did call him early 10/16/62 and advised that from now on the

10218722

line would be obtained sometime on Tuesday and would now be based

on games played this year.

On 10/17/62, PCI advised STOKES

had contacted him night of 10/16/62 and

told him that Stoks and

his "backers" had

had a difference of opinion and that the "backer!

was now going to "get things done right".

The "backer" told STOKES

that he was going to have the parlay cards printed in Hurst from

now on and therefore STOKES would not be needing JACKSON any

further. STOKES was still to distribute the cards to customers

at the Ling-Temco-Yought Corporation, Grand Prairie, Texas.
