I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION RELATED THERETO 7

A, Oliver @, SCANTLING Segment. (in relation to project objectives.)

1. “Zo collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK. personnel
and physica facilities." SCANTLING has continued to provide worthwhile in-
formation in support of this objective. | (See previous project review forwarded
‘by HMMA-20052 of 18 October 1962.) During the past year SCANTLING ves used to
follow up leads produced by both LIFEAT;ana LIENVOY in support of this objective.
In particular SCANPLING provided, in blueprint detail, casing reports on the
homes cf two Soviet intelligence officers who are. targets, for Station technical
operations. !

ANELING also is used to aid the Station in maintaining ‘current records
nees of Soviet personnel living in Mexico. . This is accomplished by
‘ollowup of LIENVOY leads which indicate Soviet. interest in renting
fie properties.

a. Support of the sensitive AMROD operation, in which Reymond H. .
GERENDE also played a vital role, ves of singular importance to
the success of the operation, SCANTLING's many fields of op-
erational experience were draim on fully and he thereby provided,
a unique contribution to the operation.. Without the assistance
of SCANTLING and GERENDE with their unique qualifications, this
operation vould have beef difficult in the extreme 1f indeed et
all possible.

». th support of the Station's harassment campaign against’ Juan Jose
AREVALO Bermejo, launched at the request of Headquarters,
SCANILING again provided the means for carrying out a large portion
of the. ection teken. ‘ SCANILING's efforts ranged from the wailing
of "poisoned" candy, to the, target. to the placing of threatening
phone calls. SCANTLING also made calls to various Mexican news-
papers and mailed "montage" pictures of AREVALO and @ Soviet in-
telligence officer to Guatemalan newspepers in the campaign to
Giscredit end discourage AREVALO in the Guatemlen. Presidential
campaign.

c. SCAHTLING is used as the elterriate contactin a sensitive LAURICLE
project. This is for the purpose cf minimizing the danger of the
action agent in this project being recognized. as being in contact
with en obvious PBPRIME citizen, SCANILING's contribution to this
operetion has been noteworthy both from the standpoint of security
and sgent handling.

&. SCANILING continued to conduct numerous pretext and neighborhood’
investigations. As in the-past many of these investigations were
reletion to highly sensitive cases.

2. "To collect operational information and identify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENIRAP operation,
handlea by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective.

LIENERAP operational emphasis continues to remain in the area of photo stakeout
of prominent Mexican Coumunists end is presently working fulltime on providing
pictures of individual Cormnists, homes suspected of being meeting sites used
by the.Cotmnist Party and the Communist Party Headquarters itself. LIENTRAP
has also recently. begun to be used on ZRKNICK leads.’ It is expected that .
activities of LIEVERAP in.that letter area will expand in the, coming” year.

3. "fo provide operational support to Station operations including the
renting of hotel rooms and safe apartments, renting and servicing of post office
voxes, and conducting counter-surveillances.” CERENDE's contribution to the
AMROD operation was noted in paragraph I.A.3.a. above. GERENDE's comprehensive
area imowledge and personal operational capabilities enable bim to make a
valugble contribution in-such operations as AMROD and also enable him to procure
the most desireable safe sites in support of the. Station's operations. ‘The
project's assets, particularly GERENDE and LIEMPTY-10, presently provide 20

‘7° post office box mail drops for use of Mexico City Station and other Stations.
Although it is platined to reduce this nmiver considerably during the next year,
(since other Station assets now can provide a number of live accommodation
addresses), @ number of post office boxze will be retained for use in future
operations.

4, The quality and quantity of opsrational inforiation produced by the
photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control and supervision
is considered by the Station worthwhile and in some cases unique. It is con-
cluded, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be contimied.

G. Relationship to the Related Mission Directive

As noted in the examples given above, Project LIEMPTY has provided valuable
support to many Station operations and thereby bas been a contributing factor to
the fwlillnent of the Related Mission objectives of thé Station. ‘The project
has mced any positive intelligence hor is it intended to do so. The

estimated costs of the project for the coming year.

Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the purpose of Project Renewal)

I,. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

_ AeA m ine Reo

A. Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities:."". SCANTLING has continued (see pre-
vious Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA~17999, 31
October 1961, HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18
November 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this. ob-
jective. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex-
.tensively to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex-
cellent example of this blending of various Station support assets was the
investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both
LIENVOY ard LIFEAT indicated the possibility of launching a successful
technical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIMERICK _
intelligence officer assigned to Mexico under diplomatic cover. with the
aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed
by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station
support assets, were successful in installing a technical device in the
target.

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping
current records on the residences of the many Soviet personnel in Mexico
City. This is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of
all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters,
{See previous project renewal requests for additional details.)

2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in-
terest operating : in Mexico". SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-
formation, on other Station targets:

a. On the basis of a lead from the ODAC installation: in
Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an
operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural
machinery (ot U.S. origin) which was in transit to Cuba. To
mount this operation, a precise and detailed casing of the imple-
ment was essential, This SCANTLING was able to accomplish ia
one trip to Veracruz wii ‘hat contribured subprantistytoy

the operation,



14-00000

b,. SCANTLING provided the Station a detailed investigation
of Harotun ("Harry") KOPOIAN, employee of American Communists
Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which determined the residence
of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and connections,

c, In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of
an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected
Station technical operation.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances,"" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples:

. a. SCANTLING completed a detailed and secure interview of
* the fiancee of BESMOOTH to determine her connection with the
principals in the MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection i
with procurement of documents used in the flight behind the tron i
Curtain. This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING
was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an
admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview,
b. SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work
in the BEXKNAVE/BECHICK operation. SCANTLING - gave his t
usual competent performance despite the fact that the role assigned.
him was unique to his experience.

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive |
Station Soviet double agent which contributed significaprly to that |
operation.

d, SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of
GPIDEAL 4s part of the Station's effort in providing maximum
protection for the GPIDEAL party,

2, In addition,.SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and.
ighborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive.
SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by
ODACID and other ODYOKE components.

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING
is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, For example,
SCANTLING tandled LIEMBROIL-2 until the return of LUMOTOR-14 in July
1962, SCANTLING is also used ic spot and rent safe acu:
for other Station operations.

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be com-
pletely fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made
important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives
specifically and to other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time
and other intengible factors, unquestionably justifies his continuation
as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities through usé of photographic base houses, *

‘Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective, To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above objective. This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for
Project Renewal. (HMMA~15979)

2, “To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective.
Among LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographic assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have
never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party.
Headquarters, During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover
the recent move of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had
of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site,

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.,
rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances,""
GERENDE is. used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments. for other
Station operations.and activities.,- GERENDE's. comprehensive area.”
imowledge and personal operational capabilities.combine to.make him an
extremely valuable ation asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

4, The quality and quantity of operational-information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE s control
and supervision is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique. The
Station concludes, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project
should be continued,

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in previous project renewals, it can readily be noted that
Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in
this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related
Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive intelligence
nor has it been intended that it snould do so, The project's sole purpose
* is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information
in support of other Station operations,

IL, CHANGES

‘There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the
past project year affecting either objectives or personnel,

Il, EFFECTIVENESS
There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter
the validity of the remarks made in Section II of 1960 project renewal re-
quest (HMMA 15979)

IV,- PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation,
which was described in 1960 renewal request, is still present but has
caused no known difficulty, .At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the
LICALLA base was reactivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator con-
tinues to be alert for any. unusual incidents which might indicate that the 2,
base has been compromised, a :

Vv. PLANS

‘The Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum
size and does not plan to expand it during the coming yzar. Efforts will
be continued co refine and bette lize the existing project organizational
arrangements, As in the.past, ration will continue its efforts to
improve the compartmentay ion ty of the proje



14-00000

Vi. COSTS

A, Past Project Year ~ Station finance records indicate that Project |
LIEMPTY expended approximately $26, 250 during Fiscal Year 1962

(1 December 1961 - 30 June 1962) and has thus far during Fiscal Year i
1963 (through 30 September 1962) expended about $7,000.00. It is

anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last two

months (October and November 1962) of the project year, This will

make a total expenditure during the project year of about $43, 250, or

$6, 250,00 under the budget estimate of $49, 500.00.

B, Next Project Year - Of the total $49,900.00 budget, itemized below,

approximately $30, 400.00 should be expended during the remainder of
Fiscal Year 1963 and the balance, $19, 500.00 should be expended during
Fiscal Year 1964, Normal accounting procedures will be used for all ex-

penditures.
