BS 166-845

On February 24, 1971, Boston PC JOAN CRANE,

advised

SA MARTIN P. CONLEY that RUDOLPH SCIARRA will

seek to establish an alibi at the forthcoming trial for

the MELEI and MARFEO murders. SCIARRA will use a priest

and a doctor to testify that SCIARRA was with them and

therefore not with "RED" KELLY at the times that KELLY

plotted with SCIARRA at the Gateway Motel.

RUDOLPH SCIARRA and his wife, LUCY, are angry

with BOBBY FAIRBROTHERS and his wife fornot supporting

them and therefore the SCIARRA's and the FAIRBROTHER'S

are not presently on speaking terms.

It is noted that federal indictments remain

pending in captioned matter only against subjects,

MANOCCHIO and VENDITUOLI.

On 12/8/70, U.S. District Court, Judge

ANDREW CAFFREY, Boston, Mass., granted the Government's

motion to dismiss the Federal indictments against

RATMOND L.S. PATRIARCA, RUDOLPH SCIARRA, JOHN ROSS,

MAURICE LERNER and ROBERT FAIRBROTHER.

The government

requested this dismissal since these 5 individuals

had previously been convicted of conspiracy to murder

under Rhode Island law:

By communication dated February 26, 1971,

the New York Division furnished the following inform-

ation:
