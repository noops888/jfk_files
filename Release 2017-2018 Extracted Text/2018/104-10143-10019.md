Mr. G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director

Select Committee on Assassinations
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Blakey:

Along with other requests, your letter of
6 July 1978 seeks access to the Office of Personnel
files of certain employees. .We have some reservations
about making available everything contained in these
employees' files. .

First, there is a variety of personal information,
the revelation of which would intrude unnecessarily on
the employee's privacy. Further, an Agency officer's
file is more than just a compendium of his career; there
is much detail on assignments, including the countries
where he served, the cover used,-a rather detailed de-
scription of duties, and information on a wide variety
of operations which are outside our understanding of
the scope of your investigation. Perhaps it would be
possible for a member of my staff to discuss the specific
area(s) of HSCA interest with your representative. A
mutually agreeable solution should be available.

Since your investigator/researchers have had the
opportunity to interview or depose employees of interest,
it would appear that the above course of action would
supplement whatever narrow areas the personal interview
left uncovered.

Sincerely,

S. D. Breckinridge
Principal Coordinator, HSCA
