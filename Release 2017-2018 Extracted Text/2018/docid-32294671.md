On the evening of December 22, 1959, MM 660-C {
telephonically contacted Special Agent C. GRAHAM HURST
and stated he had some information that he had failed to >
furnish in the past because he feared for his life as a ~
result of passing it on. He said-he still feared for his ~ fv
life, but he realized this was something big and wanted to ‘ )
call it to the attention of the FBI in order that the proper ~~
agency, United States Customs, could be advised of what is

happening to the extent that information is leaking from ie oat
the files of Miami U..S. Customs Office. Confidential Fe
Informant (CI) said there is no question in his mind that Be
he will be killed if the information is disseminated exactly )
as he relates, inasmuch’as he can only determine that three

arid ROTHMAN swore CI to secrecy that he would not reveal to
anyone under any circumstances that these reports had been
in ROTHMAN's possession. CI stated he knows this is hard
to believe; however, as proof he saw something, he said the
communication was dated December 7, 1959, and had what 1,
appeared to be File Number 23-801. CI said as best J
can recall, the file related how MAR ATZ, Miami! bondsman
who is \son-of Miami Top Jewel Thief ABF\KATZ, had gone to
GiARLse FORKED, much publicized Miamfadventurer and pilot
who hag \been involved in gun-running to Cuba,in the past,
to get HORMEL to get an airplane for him. It set forth
that HORMEL was working with U. S. Customs on this matter,
as was a man named HOGAN, who is with Liberty Aviation at
Miami International Airport. Also set forth was that the
airplane in question somehow was thought to contain jewelry
from a $35,000.00 jewel theft on 163rd'‘Street, Miami, and
an FBI Agent named STADTMILLER was mentioned.

It then related how thé plane was stopped and
Cubans were found aboard with dynamite bombs. CI was
exhaustively questioned about any further specific details,
but said this is all he can recall. CI said he cannot
specifically say what happened to the above-referred-to papers,
exceptthat apparently the man who brought them to the Biltmore
Terrace Hotel had to return them to some place or person.
CI said on a later date, he had an opportunity to say some-
thing to ROTHMAN about the man who CI saw bring the papers
to ROTHMAN, and ROTHMAN indicated the man who brought the
papers was a waiter who is an undercover man for Customs
and who gets the papers from someone else. CI said he had
hopes he would hear from several sources about ROTHMAN' s
having access to U. S. Customs reports, and then he would
not have been so apprehensive about passing on this informa-
tion, but it has not been a subject of conversation anywhere
and CI feels he has been close enough to the situation and
has enough sources of his own that if it were known, even
among a close circle of people, he would have heard it 4)

by anyone is tha IE, who is_attorney for ROTHMAN,

Special Agent HURST pointed out to CL that it would
be necessary to pass on the above information to U. S. Customs.
CI said when he called to furnish this information, he knew
that: it would have to be furnished to U. S. Customs, and he
desired that this be done, as he felt that more and more
people's lives would be endangered if and when more reports
are obtained by ROTHMAN from Customs if he can obtain them
as he claims he can. CI said that anyone, such as HORMEL,
from the underworld, who furnishes information, will more than

7 WALLACE D. SHANLEY, U. S. Customs, Miami, contacted the
Miami Office and advised he had received information from
a Confidential Source that MARTIN KATZ, son of Miami Top
Jewel Thief, ABE KATZ, was attempting to rent a plane for
a short, quick flight out of Miami that afternoon. The
purpose of the trip was not explained to the informant
of Customs. SHANLEY furnished the information for whatever
value it might have and said he was going to follow the
matter to see if any Customs violation resulted.

Since MARTIN KATZ is the son of Miami Top Jewel
Thief ABE KATZ, and since a $35,000.00 jewel theft had
recently occurred of Center Jewelry Store, Miami, in view
of possibility the plane was going to be used to transport
this jewelry, Special Agents JAMES E, HASTINGS and GEORGE
STADTMILLER interviewed Miami PCI CHARLES HORMEL for any
information he might have regarding instant flight referred
to above, as HORMEL has in past been involved in flying
matters in the Miami area of questionable nature. HORMEL
then advised he had been approached by MARTIN KATZ on the
morning of November 28, 1959, and been requested to get a
plane for a three-hour trip. HORMEL was to select a landing
place near Miami, and he was to land there and pick up
several suitcases. PCI had selected a landing strip near
Homestead, Florida, and the trip was being postponed to
11:00 p.m., November 29, 1959. HORMEL was under impression
flight entailed a smuggling operation into Cuba, and, there-
fore, this information was furnished to SHANLEY of Customs
on November 28, 1959, for whatever action deemed necessary.

On November 29, 1959, SHANLEY advised the Miami
Office he had determined above-mentioned flight had as its
ye: shipping arms and ammunition to Cuba and, therefore,
no firther action was taken by the Miami Office in,connec-
, tion with this proposed flight.

: On November 30, 1959, SHANLEY advised the Miami
‘five Cubans had been arrested by U, S. Customs at a

small airport near Florida City, Florida, on November 29, 1959,
while in the process of Yoading three packages of dynamite
aboard a Cessna twin aircraft belonging to Liberty Aircraft.
SHANLEY advised that in the pland jat the time of the arrest
were CHARLES HORMEL and GEORGE-F, » who had flown the
airplane to ‘that site. SHANLEY mfidentially advised that
the information leading to the arrest had been confidentially
furnished by HORMEL and, therefore, HORMEL and HOGAN were not
arrested. SHANLEY did not say on what charges the above men
were arrested. .

It is noted that on December 3, 1959, HORMEL was
interviewed by Special Agent JAMES E, HASTINGS concerning
HORMEL' s furnishing information to U. S. Customs. HORMEL
said he is presently under sentence in a Customs case and
they have two more cases pending against him. HORMEL said
as a result of this, he had been furnishing Customs with
information in hopes it would do him some good in future
trials involving his past activities. At this time, HORMEL
was advised that since he was furnishing information to
organizations other than the FBI, that the FBI was not going
to contact him in the future. As a result of this, the 137-
case on HORMEL was closed in the Miami Office.

It does not appear to the Miami Office that with
the above facts this constitutes a violation over which the
Bureau has jurisdiction. In order to further protect the
informant, and since the alleged "leak" apparently is in
the Miami Office of U.S. Customs, it is recommended that
the above information be furnished by the Bureau in Washington
to the Headquarters of U. S. Customs through established
liaison channels. It is recognized that information might
be received from time to time by any organization that
there is a "leak" which information might be treated lightly,
as it might be attributed to the bragging of a hoodlum, It
is felt that in order to convince U. S. Customs that there
is a leak, it will be necessary to relate to them the entire
facts set forth above, including their file number, name of

persons who have information in their file, but it should

be pointed out to Customs that it is felt if all of the
information is set down in anything other than a confidential
file maintained on a national level, then the life of the
informant is in great danger. It is noted that this informant
was formerly carried as a Top Jewel Thief of the Miami Office
and in connection with investigation of Jewel Theft Matters,
was developed by Special Agent HURST, to whom this informa-
tion was furnished, as‘a result of almost daily contact by

I Special Agent HURST. During this investigative period,

| the identity of Special Agent HURST became known to many

t of CI's criminal associates, who know there has been a

close association between the CI and Special Agent HURST.

It is felt that CI can be developed to furnish information

| of great significance and for this reason, it would be better
} if no one at U. S. Customs, except on a national level, know
that this information came from the FBI, as that factor alone
could jeopardize informant.

As a bh e-background information, th¢ Biltmore

Terrace Hotel,;although to all outward appearances /a' first-
class hotel, ts frequented by a number of Cubans who are
anti-FIDEL CASTRO and the hotel has the reputation of being
a’"hot bed" for Cuban revolutionary activities. The hotel
is allegedly owned by ex-associates of BATISTA and NORMAN

AN,, according to informants, runs the hotel, but does
ot publicly admit this. ROTHMAN was arrested by Bureau Agents
‘-“in Miami, Florida, on July 2, 1959, and is presently out on

bond.

This arrest was.in case entitled, "BERNARD J, EZHAYA; |

was indicted in Chicago on four counts of pledging stolen
Canadian Government bonds in the amount of $138,000.00. \

These bonds were part of loot from burglary committed on 4
May 3-4, 1958, of Brockville Trust and Savings Company of

Brockville, Ontario, Canada, which has been described as the

world's largest theft, involving a loss of approximately twelve
