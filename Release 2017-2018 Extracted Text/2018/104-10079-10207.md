SUMMARY of Relevant Information on Lee Harvey OSWALD at 0’

2h November 1963.

—_—_——

1. Our first information on OSWALD came from a technical
operation in Mexico City and was cabled in on 9 October 1963. It
revealed that on 1 October 1963 Lee OSWALD had been in touch there
with Soviet Consul Valery KOSTIKOV about a telegram which the
Soviet Embassy was supposed to send on him to the Soviet Embassy in

Washington. The data showed that OSWALD haa also been at the Soviet
Embassy on 28 September. Traces showed OSWALD was a former U. S.
defector to the USSR and on 10 October CIA Headquarters notified the
FBI, State end the Navy (OSWALD had been a Marine). Our Mexico Station
was told to pass its information on OSWALD to the Mexico City offices
of the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Embassy.

Since our Agency is not supposed to investigate U.S. citizens abroad

without special request, we did nothing further on the case.

2. After the assassination of President. Kennedy on 22 November,
: Mexico Station, which immediately recalled its earlier report on OSWALD
and cabled us about it, began researching all its files and records for

reports which might relate to him. It turned up pictures of @ man

than OSWALD. Mexico Station has, to date, found no pictures of

OSWALD entering the Soviet or Cuban Enbassy.

3. The search did reveal more data from technical operations,
however. This information, which comes in in great masses, had not
been previously associated with OSWALD because his name is not
actually mentioned in it, but the subject matter shows it is about
him, and our expert monitor says the voice is identical with the :
voice of 1 October known to be OSWALD's.

4, his further technical information covers a round-robin of

telephone calls and visits which OSWALD made to the Soviet and Cuban
Embassies in Mexico City between 27 September and 3 October 1963.

This has been supplemented by reports on his travel in and out of Mexico
obtained by the U. S. Consulate in the border town of Nuevo Laredo from
Mexican Immigration Service records.

5. In brief, all this information shows that Lee Harvey .OSWALD
entered Mexico (apparently by car) at Nuevo Laredo on 26 September
1963, claiming he was a photographer, living in New Orleans and bound
for Mexico City. On 27 September he was in Mexico City phoning the
Soviet Embassy to ask for a visa so he could go to Odessa, USSR. On

28 September, he was at the Cuban Embassy, and Silvia DURAN, a Mexican

Employee of the Cuban Embassy, telephoned the Soviet Embassy about his

problem. It seems that OSWALD (whose name is not mentioned) wented a

Cuban transit visa so he could go to Cuba and wait there for a Soviet

visa which would permit him and his wife to go on to the Soviet
Union. Silvia DURAN asked assurance that the Russians would grant
him the visa. A while later a Soviet official calls Silvia DURAN
back and explains that the visa applicant had been dealing with
the Soviet Consulate in Washington about the same matter and that
they could not be sure that he would ever get the Soviet visa.

The Soviet official added that the applicant had a letter showing
he belonged to an organization in favor of Cuba. Silvia DURAN and
the Soviet official agree to table the matter.

6. On 28 September 1963, OSWALD again visits the Cuban Embassy
and talks to Silvia DURAN about the same matter, and she phones the
Soviet Embassy. OSWALD also talks to a Soviet official on her phone
and says he will came to the Soviet Embassy and give him what is
apparently a forwarding address where he can be reached. There is
some hint this address may be in Cuba.

q- Onl October, OSWALD has his phone conversation with Soviet
Consul KOSTIKOV about his visa, and on the same day, OSWALD phones
the Soviet Military Attache about the same matter. The Military Attache
gives him the number of the Consul. Finally, on 3 October, OSWALD”
phoned the Military Attache again and tried to talk about a visa, “but
the Military Attache again referred him to the Consul and give him™
the right phone number.

8. That same day, 3 October 1963, OSWALD drove back into the

United States.at the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo, Texas crossing point. He

had travelled on a Mexican Tourist Card in lieu of passport.

them. She confirmed the information given above, saying nual Lee
OSWALD had professed to be a Commmist and an admirer of Castro. She
and her husband are being held incommumicado.and their arrest will
not be made known, for the time being. —

10. Observation of the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico
and of their principal intelligence officers, including KOSTIKOV,
since the assassination of President Kennedy, by both technical and
physical surveillance, shows nothing unusual.

11. Mexican President Lopez Mateos is aware of this case(and
