HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

This responds in full to a December 18,
1978, letter to the Attorney General signed by G- Robert
Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, which asked
that the FBI declassify, in toto, a Secret, September 14,
1978, response made to 16 interrogatories pertaining te
Yuri, Ivanovich Nosenko which were propounded by the
Committee in its letter of September 5, 1978.

Declassification of the September 14, 1978,
response required coordination with the Office of Legis-
lative Counsel, CIA, which interposed no objection to
declassifying certain portions of that response.

The Committee's attention is invited to the
fact that CIA did suggest, with regard to the response
to interrogatory number "8", that the FBI "... may wish
to correct the dates on which the FBI did not have direct
eccaie to. Mr. Nosenko, to read 3 April 1964 until 8 December
68. ; :

For the convenience of the Committee, the
following declassified, verbatim reiteration of the
September 14, 1978, response is provided.

This responds in full to the following enumerated
interrogatories submitted for consideration in a Letter,
dated Scptember 5, 1978, to the Attorney General and signed
by G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA.

"], On what dates and for how long was Nosenko
questioned by the FBI about Lee Harvey Oswald- . =. -°.
from 1964 to present?" F 7

The files of the FBI indicate that Yuri Ivanovich
Nosenko was interviewed regarding Oswald and/or the assassi-
nation of President John F. Keanedy on February 26 and 27;
1964, and on March 3," 4 and 6, 1964. The FBI files do not
record the specific duration in whole oF in part as to
topical discussions, of those five interviews; however,
summary communications indicate the February 27, 1964 inter-
view was conducted on the afternoon of that date and the
March 4, 1964 discussion of Osyald occurred at the outset
of an afternoon interview or that date.

#g, When Nosenko was questioned by the FBI about ©
ea Lee Harvey Oswald, who did the questioning?"

The FBI interviews of Nosenko, during which he was
questioned about Oswald and/or, the assassination of President
Kennedy, were conducted by Special Agents’ {SAsj AleKso .
Poptanich, Maurice A. Taylor and Donald EB. Walter on
February 26 and 27, 1964; by SAs Poptanich and W. Marvin
Gheesling on March 3 and 4, 1964; and by SAs Poptanich,
Taylor and Walter on March 6,. 1964.

"g, What background, if any, did the interro-
_ gator have in interrogations? What knowledge
_ did the intevrogator have with respect to Oswald's -
background?" : :

nel.

There are 10 retrievable FBI statistics upon which

to base a quantification of the interrogatory experiences of
the SA personnel who interviewed Nosenko on the £ive pertinent
occasions. Suffice it to say, the techniques of cooperative .
and hostile interrogations are integral aspects of the training
and almost daily duties of SA personnel. In that regard, it

_ ds noted that during the February and March, 1964 interviews
SA -Poptanich had almost 13 years of SA experiences SA Taylor
had over 31 years of SA experiences SA Walter had completed
almost 17 years of SA experience; and SA Gheesling had over
13 years of SA experience. Further, their respective personnel
files disclose the following:

SA Poptanich was then fluent in the Russian Language
(Nosenko's native tongue). The Annual Report of Performance
Reting, dated March 31, 1962, noted that SA Poptanich, during
the previous twelve months, had participated in the interro-
gation of a Soviet defector and his knowledge of the Russian
language and mores of the Russian people proved most helpful
relative thereto. é :

Q SA Taylor, on September Zl, 1962, received an incen- .
tive award in recognition of the superior fashion his responsi-
bilities were discharged over an extended period of time. The
Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Washington Field Office,
sites in submitting a recommendation for the incentive award,
commented that SA Taylor had demonstrated exceptional ability
in the interrogation and debriefing of three Soviet defectors,
all of whom were intelligence officers. SA Taylor's Perfor-
mance Rating for the period April 1, 1963--March 31, 1964,
noted he was recognized as the finest interrogator on the
Soviet espionage squad in the Washington Field Office, which :
accounted for his asSignments to interview Sovict defectors. ~~



House Select Comaittee on Assassinations
U. S. House of Representatives (HSCA) -

“x SA Walter was the recipient of a personal letter of
Commendation, dated October 3, 1963, from the Directer, FBI,
for his superior work in the handling of a very sensitive,
complicated, fast-moving, and highly publicized espionage case.
Previously (on November 7, 1954), he bad yeceived @ meritorius
salary increas¢ for his outstanding york on another espionage
case, successful interrogation being the key aspect of that
investigation. oS asses?

SA Gheesling,, at the time of the pertinent Nosenko
interviews, served as a Supervisor at FBI Headquarters and
had considerable experience in espionage, intelligence and
counterintelligence investigations. SA Gheesling supervised
the field investigation of Oswald (from the latter's return to
the United States on June 13, 1962 until September, 1962, and

from November 22, 1963 through mid-1964). He was assigned
exclusively to supervisory responsibilities relative to the
assassination of President Kennedy.

‘ While the specific knowledge of Oswald's background,’
possessed by these SAs at the time of the Nosenko interviews,
: can be answered only by the SAs themselves, SA Gheesling's
bead prior assignment to supervision of the Oswald investigation
would tend to indicate that he, at least, was quite knowledge-
able of data contained in FBI files concerning Oswald.

"4, On the dates that Nosenko was questioned ebout
_ Oswald, does there now exist or did there ever exist:
a. a tape of the questions esked and Nosanko's
answers; : 7 :
b. a transcript of the questions asked and é HE

As noted in FBI memorandum dated June 19, 1978,-
captioned as above, and which was prepared in response to HSCA
letter, dated June 13, 1978, to the Attorney General, FBI

ox verbatim transcripts of FBI interviews with Nosenko thet
concerned Oswald and/or the assassination of President Kennedy.
A_docuent has been located which indicates that ‘FBI personnel
id record the Februaty 26 and 27, 1964, interviews of Nosenko,
among others. Since no recordings oF transcripts have been
located, it can be assume: that the recordings were used by
the interviewing SAs to check the accuracy of their notes
prior to dictating the results. of the interviews. It is
further assumed that, upon verifying the accuracy of summary
reportings of the interviews, the recordings were disposed of
since they had served the purpose for which they were made,
although no record of such, disposition can be found. Summary
reportings of the five pertinent interviews are extant, and
were delivered to the HSCA on March 21, 1978.

"g, What criteria, if any, was used to determine:
a. what subjects to question Nosenko about; :
b. how much time to devote to each subject?"

Z FBI files do not contain a specific enumeration of
criteria used to determine the particular subjects Noseako
was to be questioned about nor the amount of time to be devoted

to each subject in the questioning. e

"g, What significance — with respect to possible
foreign involvement in the assassination as vel
as to the issue of Nosenko's bonafides (sic}—did

statements about Oswald?"

The FBI, during the years 1964-1968, considered
Nosenko's statements about Oswald te be very Si
of his initial reportings, the veracity of which had to be
assessed in relation to the totality of information furnished
by him, The FBI perceived Nosenko's statements about Oswald,
depending upon a subsequent, definitive resolution of Nosenko's
pona fides, to be the most authoritative information available
indicative cf a lack of Soviet governmental involvement in the

assassination of President Kennedy.

the FBI attach today to Nosenko's statements about
Oswald?" a

a

é The FBI does not perceive any significant evidence of

foreign involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,

nor does the FBI perceive any credible evidence that Nosenko's

_ defection was a Soviet ploy to mask Soviet governmental
involvement in the assassination. Therefore, the FBI is
satisfied that Nosenko reported the facts about Oswald as he
imew thea.

"g. If the answer to question 6 is different from
* the response to question 7, when did the change
occur and why?" i

The FBI had no direct access to Nosenko from
April 3, 1964 until April 3, 1969, and therefore was not in
a position to make an objective assessment of his bona fides
nor of the veracity of information furnished by him. Thus,
information provided by him, in early 1964, was. accepted at
4 face value and qualified in terms of the source and the
conditions under which it was received. On October 1, 1968,
the FBI advised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that,
based upon a review of material provided by CIA, the FBI
_found no substantial basis to conclude that Nosenko was not
a bona fide defector; however, the FBI did not reach any
overall, definitive conclusions regarding his bona fides
because of a lack of access to Nosenko and all collateral
information pertinent to such an assessment. Effective
May 11, 1977, the CIA and FBI concurred that Nosenko was 4
bona fide defector, based upon an assessmeat of the :
totality of information furnished by hin.

f

As indicated in the responses to questions 7 and &,
the FBI, as of October 1, 1968, found no substantial basis to
conclude Nosenko was not a bona fide defector; as of May 11,
1977, accepted a CIA assessment that Nosenko was a bona fide
defector; and has not perceived any significant evidence,
from 1964 to date, that Nosenko reported other than the facts
about Oswald as he knew then. E :

"15, Did either the FBI or the CIA have primery © .
responsibility for investigating Nosenko's state-
ments about Oswald? If neither had primary
responsibility, was there any division of
responsibility?" - : ee

: The FBI had primary responsibility for investigating
Nosenko's statements about Oswald that pertained to his
{Oswald's) activities in the United States, including the
assassination of President Kennedy. The CIA had primary
responsibility for investigating Nosenko's statements about
Oswald's activities abroad.

"16, What communication, if any, existed between
the FBI and CIA with respect to evaluating and/or
investigating Nosenko's statements about Oswald?"

The FBI forwarded a letter, dated March.6, 1964,
from the Director, FBI, to the Director, CIA, enclosing
memoranda dated February 28, 1964,-and March 4, 1964, cap-
tioned "Lee Harvey Oswald," which summarized the results of
FBI interviews of Nosenko regarding Oswald on February 26
and 27, 1964, and March 3 and 4, 1964. The results of a CIA
interview of Nosenko on January 23, 1964, regarding Oswald
were furnished to the FBI in a letter from the CIA dated
April 28, 1964. These particular pieces of correspondence,
while not setting forth any specific requests or investiga-
tive leads, were furnished for purposes of evaluation.

Where information is not provided, it is either
not retrievable from FBI Headquarters files or is not being
