MEMORANDUM FOR: Haviland Smith, Jr.
SA/DDCI
FROM: Lyle L. Miller
Acting Legislative Counsel
SUBJECT: Spot Report_Dated, ?4 May 1978--Expression of
~ Concem by|Belgial Service|with "U.S. Law'

on Reporting to the Congréss

1. (S) Subject memorandum notes that a registered .
concern over a "copy of a U.S. law ... which cot interpreted as obliging .
CIA to identify 'to certain members of the Congress' its’ sources" and sources’
of liaison services if mown. My view is that the quoted "U.S. law't is the
intelligence charter legislation (S. 2525/H.R. 11245), which, of course, is
not yet law but which could be mischaracterized as such. We have received
expressions of concern from other liaison services regarding provisions in
the charter legislation.

2. (U) There is no provision in the charter legislation that explicitly
would require the CIA to disclose intelligence sources to the Congress.
There are, however, several provisions that could be construed to extend
the reach of the Congress into sources and liaison matters. These pro-
visions include the following:

a. Subsection 114(j) would require that .all proposed
liaison agreements be reported to the oversight committees.

b. Subsection 137(b) would require notification to the
Oversight committees whenever an entity of the Intelligence
Conmmity: requests a foreign service to engage in. any activity.
in which the U.S. entity would be prohibited from engaging
without prior Presidential approval.

c. Subsection 152(a) contains. the overall congressional
oversight provisions, requiring, among other things, .that the
oversight committees be kept "fully and currently informed"
and that the Executive will furnish to the committees “any
information or material ... whenever requested ..."



3. (S) There are, of course, other documents which could give rise
to a misimpression that the CIA could be required to disclose intelligence
sources to the Congress. For example (only the first of these is a "U.S.
law"): :

a. The Hughes-Ryan Amendment (section 662 of the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended), which requires notification’
to the Congress of covert action findings.

b. ‘The general oversight and reporting requirements in
S. Res. 400 and H. Res. 658 which established the two intelligence
oversight committees; these, of course, are not binding on the
Executive Branch.

c.. The general oversight and reporting requirements in
section 3-4 of E.0. 12036, which, if read without reference to
the section's prefatory language or if read bya person not at
all familiar with our Government, could be construed as requiring
that the Executive Branch must provide: any information the
oversight committees request.

d. .H. Res. 222, which established the House Select Committee
on Assassinations, provides for a broad. mandate to conduct an
inquiry into. the assassinations of. President Kennedy and Martin
Luther King; yet the terms of the Resolution, while providing |
standard subpoena authority and so forth, do not remotely.
touch on intelligence. The Memorandum of Understanding between.
the DCI and the Chairman of the Assassinations Committee,
although not a public document, discusses the mamer in which
identities of intelligence sources will be retained or deleted
from material to which the Committee has access.. There.are no
references to liaison sources or arrangements, however, in the
Memorandum of Understanding:. Beteeterteae

e. H. Res.. 252, which established the so-called “Fraser”
Committee" to investigate aspects of Korean-American relations,
similarly grants the Committee a broad investigative mandate,
including subpoena power, but does not have anything to do
with intelligence sources-or liaison matters. ~ The: operative
Memorandum of Understanding recognizes the authority of the
DCI to excise sensitive information from material made available
to the Committee.



: 4. (S) In sun, although it is possible thu[____lexpression
of concern ‘could have been based on one or more of the items mentioned in

paragraph 3 (it would of course be interesting if the service had obtained
a copy of one or both of the Memoranda of Understanding discussed above) ,
in my view the reference probably was to intelligence charter legislation.
