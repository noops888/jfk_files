over to the AM, in order that it might carry out its

various activities. MM Tol said the AM receives from

fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollars monthly

from the Cuban Revolutionary Council, in order to

carry out certain underground activities in Cuba.

He

indicated that the AM has received monthly financial

On October 9, 1961, MM T-4, who is personally

acquainted with CELSO LUIS PIMIENTA, advised he had

learned that the latter individual had said an anti-

CASTRO group called the 30th of November had purchased

an HT-4 radio transmitter and a BC-348 receiver from

Aircraft Radio Marine Company, located at Northwest

36th Street, Miami, Florida, for the sum of thirteen

hundred dollars. PIMIENTA said this equipment was set

up for clandestine operation in the home of a woman

named LEONOR TALAVERA, located at_ 1500_Northwest 25th

Avenue, Miami, Florida.

PIMIENTA said a woman was

going to operate the equipment; however, it was sub-

sequently learned that the woman was not qualified

to operate the equipment, and the idea was dropped.

PIMIENTA related that the 30th of November

group thereafter contacted PIMIENTA and asked him if

he would operate the equipment from the above described

reSidence.

PIMIENTA said he told the group he did not

want to have anything to do with that equipment, but

if anything, he would use his own personal transmitter.

PIMIENTA said he thereafter took his trans-

mitter to the above described residence, but he never

made a contact with

anyone in Cuba, or any other

country for that matter, and indicated he subsequently

took his radio equipment out of that residence.

PIMIENTA said he believed the 30th of November

group was bluffing, and contrary to their statements,
