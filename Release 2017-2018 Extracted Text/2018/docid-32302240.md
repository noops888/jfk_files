On November 28, 1959% a confidential source

they have a ready market for it. Mrs. HICKMAN added that her

husband seems to be quite enthused about this matter, tells

her it is a legitimate enterprise and that it will be very

lucrative.

She related that HICKMAN never does confide in her

about the details of any deal he is working on, and adds

that she knows very few of his associates.

She claims she

was in Zurich with HICKMAN from May to August, 1959.

Mrs. HICKMAN added during that time HICKMAN never mentioned

any Canadian bonds to her and never Indicated he was anxious

to contact any American authorities for any reason at all.

She stated while HICKMAN was in Europe on this trip, he was

constantly travelling and for that reason she did not have a

lot of personal contact with him. She pointed out she

spent part of her time with her son, daughter-in-law and

grandson in an Army base in Bordeau, France. She pointed out

at the present time she is somewhat worried about HICKMAN,

because she has not heard from him for a week or two, pointing

out the last time she heard from him he was in bed with a

bad case of the flu in Switzerland and she was concerned that

he might be seriously ill.

As Indicated above, on December 10, 1959, a

confidential source abroad advised the Miami

FBI Office that

PAUL BERT HICKMAN was In custody at Bern, Switzerland in

The file also reflects that after several hear.

ings on the matter the Judge still upheld his stand that

BROWDER should be granted a new trial.

On November 24, 1959, PICHARDO appeared at the

FBI Office in Miami accompanied by Attorney RICHARD BOOTH.

BOOTH is the attorney for BROWDER. BOOTH explained to

SA JOHN P. LENIHAN that he is the attorney for PICHARDO,

stated that PICHARDO is now residing in Miami, and stated

PICHARDO did not want to discuss any phase of

the BROWDER

case with Agents of the FBI.

SA LENIHAN determined after meeting PICHARDO,

that he is identical with FBI f641798B.

On November 24, 1959, Immigration & Naturalization

Service (INS) Investigator JOSEPH THURMAN, advised that INS

had a case on PICHARDO. He related.

that PICHARDO came in

through Customs at Rey West, Florida on November 22, 1959,

claimed to be an American citizen and was readmitted on that

basis.

A search of his luggage, however, disclosed a Cuban

tion underway to determine if PICHARDO had actually served in

the Cuban Air Force, in which case PICHARDO would have lost his

citizenship. THURMAN stated PICHARDO apparently was going to

deny having served in the Cuban Air Force, and had engaged

Attorney RICHARD BOOTH in order to hold his status as a

naturalized American citizen. Mr. THURMAN stated that a hear-

ing was set in the PICHARDO matter for December 4, 1959, but

it was likely that this hearing would be postponed by the

INS to give them more opportunity to investigate the matter

further.
