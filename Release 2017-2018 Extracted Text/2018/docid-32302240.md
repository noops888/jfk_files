On August 21, 1959, RICHARD B, JAFFE, PSI,
advised SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR., that NORMAN ROTHMAN, L
manager of the Biltmore Terrace Hotel, Miami Beach,
Florida, had been associated with some anti-CASTRO
elements in the Miami area and they were discussing
placing a half million dollar price on the head of
CASTRO's associate, WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN. PSI added
that ROTHMAN and others discussed having an American crime
syndicate sign a contract to effect the assassination of
MORGAN on behalf of the Dominican dictator TRUJILLO, who
would furnish the money. ROTHMAN told PSI that he had
purchased dynamite for some people in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, who had been responsible for blowing up several
Cuban airplaines at the Miami International. Airport—
recently. ROTHMAN did not disclose the identity of the
"crime syndicate" he referred to but he described it as
"the organization."

ROTHMAN added that "the organization" does not
desire to take over gambling in Cuba in the event CASTRO
is-overthrown but they do desire to obtain business con-
ecessions and franchises. ROTHMAN added that he personally ,.
expected to receive a hundred thousand dollars for a share
in the contract to assassinate MORGAN.

On August 24, 1959, JAFFE advised SA LEMAN L.
STAFFORD, JR., that ROTHMAN told him that he is.in solid
with the MANARINO gang in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and ~
would be able to obtain money to assist in toppling the
government of FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba.

On August 31, 1959, JAFFE advised SA STAFFORD '
that ROTHMAN was in the process of obtaining a U. S. 7
passport for the purpose of traveling abroad. ROTHMAN
di@ not disclose his destination, ‘date of departure, .
itinerary or purpose of the trip. B
é On September 18, 1959, MM 635-8 advised SA
GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR., at Miami, that EDWARD BROWDER
claimed he had paid $25,000.00 each for two boats that
looked as though they were former LSTs and which’ were

quantity of stolen Canadian bonds and mentioned that thirty
million dollars worth of stolen bonds are involved.

pleaded not guilty’on this new indictment and trial date

BROWDER had to stay within the limits of the Southern
District of Florida or the continental limits of the United
States. Judge CHOATE stated his intention was that BROWDER
had to stay within the continental limits of the United’ .
States and if BROWDER wanted to leave the country at any
time, written permission should be obtained from Judge
CHOATE.

At the hearing on December 4, 1959, BROWDER :

On November 28, 1959, a confidential source is

abroad advised the Miami Office that efforts to locate HICKMAN
in Switzerland have been unavailing. ‘This source stated that :
HICKMAN had registered at the Grand Hotel Dolder in Zurich, ores
on May 28, 1959, that he visited Basel, Switzerland on that same
date, that he visited Zurich on July 20, 1959, and that he
was believed to have been in Lugano, Switzerland on July 23,
1959. () : : : -

On December 7, 1959, Mrs. PAUL BERT HICKMAN was
telephonically contacted by SA JOHN P, LENIHAN. She stated
her husband is still in Switzerland, and can be contacted
care of Ducatal A. G., 77 Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich, Switzerland.
She added HICKMAN travels considerably. Mrs. HICKMAN asserted
that her husband's return date to the United States is uncer-
tain,but estimated it would be at least two months hence.

On December 8, 1959, Mrs. PAUL BERT HICKMAN was 1
reinterviewed at her residence. She stated her husband is
still in Switzerland, so far as she knows, although she has
not heard from him for a few weeks. She added tht he is

associates, probably BROWDER included, will buy gold bars,

in Mexico and fly the gold from Mexico to Switzerland, where
they have a ready market for it. Mrs. HICKMAN added: that her
husband seems to be quite enthused about this matter, tells
her it is a legitimate enterprise and that it will be very
lucrative.

She related that HICKMAN never does confide in her
about the details of any deal he is working on, and adds
that she knows very few of his associates. She claims she
was in Zurich with HICKMAN from May to August, 1959.
Mrs. HICKMAN added during that time HICKMAN never mentioned
any Canadian bonds to her and never indicated he was anxious
‘to contact any American authorities for any reason at all..
She stated while HICKMAN was in Europe on this trip, he was
constantly travelling and for that reason she did not have a
lot of personal contact with him. She pointed out she
spent part of her time with her son, daughter-in-law and
grandson in an Army base in Bordeau, France. She pointed out
at the present time she is somewhat worried about HICKMAN,
because she has not heard from him for a week or two, pointing
out the last time she heard from him he was in bed with a aa:
bad case of the flu in Switzerland and she was concerned that +
he might be seriously i11.

As indicated above, on December 10, 1959, a
confidential source abroad advised the Miami FBI Office that
PAUL BERT HICKMAN was in custody at Bern, Switzerland in
connection with illegal arms traffic and gold smuggling.
This source stated HICKMAN was in touch with EDWARD BROWDER,
JR. and that BROWDER might go to Bern, Switzerland to assist
HICKMAN. @)

The file also reflects that after several hear-
ings on the matter the Judge still upheld his stand that
BROWDER should be granted a new trial.

On November 24, 1959, PICHARDO appeared at the
FBI Office in Miami accompanied by Attorney RICHARD BOOTH.
BOOTH is the attorney for BROWDER. BOOTH explained to
“SA JOHN P. LENIHAN that he is the attorney for PICHARDO,
stated that PICHARDO is now residing in Miami, and stated
PICHARDO' did not want to discuss any phase of the BROWDER
case with Agents of the FBI. :

SA LENIHAN determined after meeting PICHARDO,
‘that he is identical with FBI #6417983.

On November 24, 1959, Immigration & Naturalization
Service (INS) Investigator JOSEPH THURMAN, advised that INS
had a case on PICHARDO. He related that PICHARDO came in-
through Customs at Key West, Florida on November 22, 1959,
claimed to be an American citizen and was readmitted on that “
basis. A search of his luggage, however, disclosed a Cuban
Air Force uniform. For that reason, the INS had an investiga .-
tion underway to determine if PICHARDO had actually served in ,
the Cuban Air Force, in which case PICHARDO would have lost his
citizenship. THURMAN stated PICHARDO apparently was going to
deny having served: in the Cuban Air Force, and had engaged
Attorney RICHARD BOOTH in order to hold his status as a
naturalized American citizen. Mr. THURMAN stated that a‘hear-
ing was set in the PICHARDO matter for December 4, 1959, but
it was likely that this hearing would be postponed by the
INS to give them more opportunity to investigate the matter
further.
