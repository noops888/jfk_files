’ A staffer from Rep David Mcintosh (R-IN) district office called asking whether CIA had a packet of unclassified Kennedy
assassination material we could send to the Congressman's district office. I told him that under.the 1992 law bearing on
the Kennedy records, all declassified material was being turned over to the National Archives (NARA.) | advised him to
contact the Archives, but suggested to him that the material consisted of a large collection of documents rather than some

book or compilation that could be easily sent to him. (U)
