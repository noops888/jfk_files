MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

SUBJECT : Yuriy Ivanovich WOSENKO

Summary

1, The Director has requested that there be con-
ducted immediately an exhaustive examination regarding
the possibility of damaging publicity and embarrassment
to the Agency should it become public knowledge that we
have held Subject incommmicado for over two years. This
memorandum seeks an advisory epinion from the General Coun-
sel on the Agency's legal basis for its handling of Sub-
ject to cate, on the position that could best be@ assuned
i= the Agency were called upon to defend its uandling of
Subject, and on tegal cma of Subject's eventual dis-
posal.

Background

2. Subject voluntarily established contact with CIA
representatives in Geneva in 1962. He identified himself
as a staff officer of the KGB's Internal Security Direc-
torate and offered to sell counterintelligence information.
This offer was accepted and he was recruited as an agent
in place and debriefed on counterintelligence matters dur-
ing five meetings in Geneva. He than returned to the
USSR. He came to Geneva again in January 1964 as the
security officer for the Soviet disarmament delegation,
After a number of meetings with his CIA haadlers he de-
fected on 4 Pebruary 1964 and was secretly taken to Frank~
furt, Cermany, crossing the Swiss-German border on the
night of 4/5 February with alias U.S. Army identity cocu-
mants. In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,
Subject wrote out an asylum request, requesting political
asylum from the U.S. Government (see Tab A).

3. Because serious doubts about Subject's bona
had arisen on the basis of the information he had pr
vided both in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964,
it was originally planned to do a detailed bona fides de-
briefing and assessment in Germany before making any

Gecision about moving Subject to the United States. How-
ever, unprecedeated action by the Soviet Government in
ect to the defection of one of its citizens forced
scuary, unicent. ed Soviet

2G the news to the press that Sub-
act, described as an “expert attached to the Soviet Dele-
gation to the Disarmament Conference" had disappeared,
and that it was presumed that he had defected. Because
of mounting pressure from the press, wnich included much
speculation that Subject was a high level scientist or ~
disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Depart-
ment would make a brief announcement acknowledging Subject's
request for asylum in the U.S. and identifying aim as a
member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February (see Tab
B). On 11 February, the Soviat Government delivered a
note to the American imbassy in Moscow asking how Subject
left Switzerland and requesting an immediate interview
with him and his releasa. On 12 February, Soviet Ambassa-
dor to the Disarmament Conference. TSARAPXIN hald a press
conference in Geneva in which he accused the Swiss Govern-
ment of failure to cooperate in locating Subject. Although
the Swiss categorically rajected these charges, the Ameri-
can Ambassador to Switzerland recommended that Swiss
authcrities be allowed to interview Subject to convince
themselves that Subject had left Switzerland of his own
free will.

4. On 12 Fekruary,, on the instructions of the Dirac-
tor, Subject was brought to the United States, Ne travelled
by commercial air, again using alias U.S. Army identifica-
ticn, and was admitted to the country at New York City
(in true name) on parole under the provisions of Section
212 (da) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (see
Tab C).

5. On 13 February, representatives of the Swiss and
Soviet Embassies in Washington advised the State Depart-
ment that they desired interviews with Subject. On 14 Febru-
ary, in Noscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO called in
Ambassador KOHLER and protested “impermissable activities"
on the part of the U.S. in Subject's case. Soviet press
spokesmen took an even harder line to Western. correspond-
ents, and accused the U.S. of kidnapping Subject. On the
afternoon of 14 February, at two separate interviews,
Subject spoke first to Swiss Embassy and then to Soviet
Embassy representatives (see Tab D). At these interviews,
which were also attended by State Department and INS

officials, Subject confirmed that he left Switzerland of
his own free will to seek asylun in the U.S. Ia addition,
ct replied to questions of the Soviet Embassy repre-
ative to the effect that ue was renouncing his Sovi
citizensnin. On the avening of 14 February, the U.S.
State Department made a brief formal reply to the Soviet
protest, then issued a brief statement to the press noting
that the interviews had been held and trat Subject had
confirmed his desire to remain in this country.

6. From the time cf his arrival to 4 April 1964,
Subject was housed in an Agency safehouse in the Washing-
ton area. During this period, regular systematic debrief-
ing was commenced, and Subject was made available to
representatives of the FBI for debriefing on matters affect-
ing their responsibilities. Although allowed out for
evening and week-end excursions, Subject was at all times
accompanied by 0/S personnel. In addition, Subject took
@ two-week vacation to Hawaii, again accompanied. by case
officers and security guards. Evidence continued to mount
that Subject was a KGB plant. and at the same time it be-
came obvious that it would be impossible to proceed fur-
ther to resolve the many suspicious points and contradictions
that had arisen without changing the conditions in which
Subject was being held. Subject was growing increasingly
uncocperative, especially when sensitive areas were touched
upon, and constantly pressed for the legalizaticn of his
Status in the U.S. and the issuance of an alien registra-
tien car@. At the same time, Subject's heavy drinking
and cther unruly personal habits were causing increasing
Gifficulties to the security personnel charged with keep-
ing him under control and out of trouble at all times, and
it was clear that it was only a matter of time before he
created a public scandal. More important, he was in a
position to communicate with the KGB since physical control
could not be absolute.

7, On 4 April 1964 Subject voluntarily underwent a
polygraph examination. The results of this examination
indicated deception on a number of critical points indi-
cating that he was sent out by the KG3 to perform one or
more missions. which also involved his penetration of the
Agency and its operations. It was decided, therefore,
that the physical circumstances of Subject's stay in this
country would have to be drastically changed if the Agency
were to carry out is counterintelligence responsibilities
and adhere to the terms of the parole agreement. As a
result, Subject was moved to quarters where his movements

were sus pending resolution of bor
remained in this status to the present time,

8. It is worth noting that had we not taken the above
action but accepted Subject at face value, it is quite pos-
sible that we would have proceede th a series of opera~
tional actions on the basis of Subject's information. The
results of some of these actions could nave been very em~
barrassing to the U.S. Government politically and damaging
to U.S. national. security. For example, Subject's chief
operational proposal at tie time, one that he was most
insistent we should proceed. with immediately, involved the
sexual compromise of Vladimir Paviovica SUSLOV, the most
senior Soviet official in the United Nations Secretariat,
holding tne position. of Undersecretary in Charge of Poli-
tical and Security Council Affairs.

Bona Fides

9. Since April 1964, hunéreds of hours nave been
devoted to interrogations of Subject (in which he has
willingly cooperated) and a great deal of time has been
spent on exhaustive collateral investigations. We con-
clude that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt
that Subject is a KGB agent who established contact with
CIA and subsequently defected on XGB instructions, ane
that he came to tha United States on a deception mission.
The implications of tais mission have a grave and direct
bearing on U.S. national security. Although our findings
are supported by the results of two polygraph @xaminations
(assecond one has just been administered), we must note
that the nature of the evidence is inadmissable in a
court of law. In any case, it is clear that Subject has
not been in a position te perform any overt act of trans~
gression of U.S. espionage laws since 4 April 1964 when
he ves placed in a restricted area and deprived of any
conceivable meats of communication with the KGB.

20. Subject doss not admit that he defected on KGB
orders or that he came to the U.S. on a KGB mission. He
has admitted, however, that he made numerous lies about
his personal history and about the details of his KGB
service to U.S. officials, both before and after arriving
in the United States. (A translation of a handwritten
statement by Subject about these lies is attached as ‘fab E.)

Coordination with Other U.S. Government Agencies

1l. USIB Members. In accordance with the DACI’s
ruling relating to a defector who has been a member of

5.

a hostile intelligence servic Subject's status and
handling was discussed at an ecutive session of USIB
and decided on an ad hee basis, NOSENKO defected on

A ybruary, and the Secretary of ttorney
General, the Special Assistant to President on National
Security Affairs, McGeorge Bun eral Carroll, Direc-
tor of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the FBI were
all notified immediately. On 5 February, General Carter
reported the defection to an executive session of USIB
and followed this up with formal statements to USIB mem
bers on 11 and 19 February (see Tab F), which stated that
Subject's bona fides had not yet bean established. It
was agreed Ehat no DS number would be issued to Subject,
and that he would be handle@ on a special basis by this
Agency. In fact, normal USIB interest in Subject aa a
defector dropped off drastically as it kecame quickly
apparent that he had no positive intelligence interest
of value to any part of the community.

12. The President was informed of the full extent
of our suspicions about Subject's bona fides by the then
Director, Mr. McCone, on 11 February 1964. “Mr. Patrick
Coyne, Executive Secretary of the PFIAB, was given a simi-

lar briefing by Mr. Halms on 19 February 1984.

13, Generals Carroll and Fitch of DIA were also sub-
sequently informed of the problems about Subject's bona
fides (see Tab G).

14. ‘fhe Secretary of State, Ambassador Thompson,
and other senior officials in the Department of State
were informed of our reservations about Subject's bona
fides and our fears that he might be a dispatched KG3_
agent. In discussions about the possibility of Subject's
eventual deportation, the Secretary of State expressed
serious concern about the adverse reaction that such a
move might have on other potential defectors (sce Tab H).

.

15. The Director of Security, State Department, was
informea of the bona fides problem at an early date. We
have worked closely with this Office since then on the
problem of evaluating the significance of Subject’s in-
formation as it affects the security interests of the
State Department.

16. The problem of Subject's bona fides took on
particular significance and urgency in respect to the



13-00000

According to Subject's

GS line of responsibility for
arvey Oswal nile Uswald vas in the Soviet Union,
after the assassination of President Kennedy, Suiject
particinated in an investigation of Oswald's activities
in the USSR. In the course of his official duties, nae
alleges that he nad read Oswald's dossier. Subject was
therefore in a position to vouch for the fact that the
KGB had never had any interest in Oswald, considered nim
to be “abnormal” and were delighted to get rid of him.
{For good measure, Subject threw in a story about Oswald's
being a poor shot.) As Mr. Rankin, the Chief Counsel of
the Warren Commission commented, if Subject's story could
be accepted at face value the Commission could easily
terminate its work sooner than it had expected. Rankin
was informed therefore that there were aspacts of Subject's
information that caused us grave concern and that we were
not able to say that his information on Oswald should be
accepted uncritically (sse Tab I).

17. Because so mech of Subject's information affected
U.S. internal security matters for which the PBI bears
primary responsibility, and because of the possibility
that Subject was a KGB plant has a direct bearing on the
validity of certain FBI opsrations, the FBI has been kept
fully informed on our views about Subject's bona fides
and our progress in interrogating and investigating hin
from the moment of his defection to the present time.
Thus, C/CI_ informed the FRI liaison officer about our
Renee veesone on Subject's bona fides as early as 5 Febru-
ary 196 Or of the FEI 4 ty for
Thverkal Security, William Sullivan, have been kept com-
pry tehy ue to ake ger since and we have coordinated
all Tiajor aspects Of our handling of Subject with then.
After a long meeting with Sullivan and other FBI repre-
sentatives to review Subject's case on 1 April 1964, the
FBI interposed no objections to our proposal to restrict
Subject's movements and commence nostile interrogation
(sea Tab J). Subsequently, the FBI has formally agreed
with our findings on Subject, at least to the extent that
"On considering carefully the results of your interroga-
tions of Yuri NOSENKO and your analysis of his statements
and activities, it does appear he is not what ne purports
to be, While this Bureau is not in a position to draw
any conclusion in this case, we do recognize it is possi-
ble that NOSENKO could be a Soviet plant or agent provoca-
teur.”. (See Tab K.)

18, The then Acting Attorney General + hichola
Katzenbach (and several ers of his staff) were apprised
F our reservations about Subject on Z April 1554 and an
opinion was sought from h: both as to interpretation of
the exclusion and parcle agreement, and as to how we should
proceed in the event that it proved necessary to deport
Subject from this country. Pertinent memoranda are attached
as Tab L.

Queries from Congressmen, the Press, and the Public

19. There have been several queries. from congress~
men about Subject's status and whereabouts, and from the
press about the possibility of interviewing Subject. The
general formula that was worked out to answer such requests,
adapteaé as necessary to fit the specific request, runs as
follows:

"Yuriy Nosenko requested asylum in the United States
in February 1964. His request was granted. The
information Mr. Nosenko is providing is regularly
made available to appropriate agencies of the
Government. However, publicizing. this information
and its source could only increase the possibility
of Soviet reprisal against Mr. Nosenko and ethers
who may seek. asylum in the Free World.*

Several specific examples are attached as Tab N.

Efforts to Keep the KGB from Learning of Our Awareness of
Subjace’s true Status
20. From the time we learned that Subject had been
sent to this Country on a KG3 mission it was obvious that
if we were to have the time to analyze and resolve this
case, and to plan and execute appropriate countermeasures,
it was essential that we attempt to keap the KGB from
learning of our awareness of Subject's true status. Con-
sequently, detailed knowledge of the depth and scope of
our suspicions about Subject, and the implications thereof,
has been restricted to a vary few people in the Agency
and the intelligence community. Nonetheless, as can be
seen from paragraphs 11 to 12 above, we dic advise key
policy echelons and principals in the intelligence com-
munity, even though this carried the inevitable risk of
leakage. As you can see from Tab H, we have not disclosed
eur suspicions about Subject in our responses to press and
congressmen, Even in our formal correspondence to the
PFIAB, for example, the most we have said is that "Sub-
ject's bona fides has not been established" (see Tab F).

Subject's Status

22, fo recapitulate, Susject entered the United
States on 12 February i864 cn parole to t
the provisions of Section Z12 (4) (5) of the Tnmigration

and Nationality Act. As we understand it, parcle re-
sponsibility is delegated to the Agency by the Atter
General and the DCI on 10 February 1955, which states:

“AEter parole of such aliens. tt ibaeeibes Tntei-
ligence Agency will assume res: for care,
supervision and control of a s gree it

elieves consistent 7
needs of the United States during eone st aiaaG @ of
their parole status,”

In accordance with our understand ng of this a
and because we have reason to believe that Sub
conscious and willing agent of a hostile intelligence
service, we have seen to it that Subject was under our
Civact obgervation and control at all times from tha

moment cf his arrival in the United States From 12 febru-
ary te 4 April 1964 it was possible to keep Subject ata
location where he could enjoy a certain amount of movemsnt
and of sontact with the outside world. Since 4 April 1964,
for reasons explained in paragraph 6 of this» memorancum,

to very few within it). Authorization for Subject. to
remain in 8 country under the Special Agreement Pro-
cedures has been periecically extended by the Lenigration
and Naturalization Service. The current extension is good
until 17 February 1967 (see fab N).

23. Although his freedom of movement has been severely
restricted, Subject has not been maltreated and ne has not
made any’ formal complaint about his treatment. On the
contrary,. we have several written statements from him in
the past year in which he states that our handling of him
was justified and even beneficial {sea Tab E).

bisposal

24. From the time that Subject was brought to this
country we have thought about tne possibility of his event-~
ual deportation as a contingency measure. You will recall
talks on this in which you participated in the spring of
1964: at that time we thought that it might Le possible
to mitigate the political and propaganda drawbacks of a
forced deportation by announcing that Subject has con-
fessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time. how-
ever, and in view cf our much firmer conclusions about
Subject's real role and mission and our clearer understand-
ing of what this implies, it is apparent that great practi-
cal problems stand in the way. of his deportation to
either the USSR or a third country.

@. USSR: Subject has categorically stated on
numerous occasions that he will never contemplate
return to the USSR, and although we suspect that he
might secretly welcome such a move, we would expect
him to act out his part to the end with loud protests
that he was being shipped to his death, ete. When
the pessibblity of expulsion was discussed with De-
partment of State officials in 1964, both tha Secre-
tary of State and Ambassador Thompson expressed
their concern for the adverse effect this might have
on other potential defectors. Forcible repatriation
of political refugees is against long established
U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse viclent
reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United
States and the congressmen representing them. Under
these circumstances (and we can be sure that the KGB
will dco whatever they can to promote the furor), an

18 renounced his Soviet citizenshio. The
anly lecation cansidered so far fer turnover to the
Soviets has been Berlin, which was used for the
exchange of Abel-Powers and Lonsdale-Wynne, and for
the transfer of several Scviet defectors who re-
quested return. Subject does not appear to fit
either category. On the other hand, if Subject were
to agree to turnback, there is a real question as to
whether the Soviets would accept him in Serlin as
they did the others in the past. Their current
practice is to handle repatristion of Soviet citizens
through the Soviet Embassy in Benn. Finally, if
Subject were accepted by the Soviets on the basis of
forced repatriation, the Soviets might carry through
the charade, try Subject as a traitor, and give wide
publicity to statements by him about his “maltreat-
ment by CIA,” etc.

b. Third Country Although we believe it
likely that Subject would accede to depertation to
& third country, there is certainly no country in
the free world on which we could conceivably try to
, unload Subject without first informing them of nis
true status. Even if we considered this a desir-
able cbjective (and we do not), it seems certain
that the Department of State would veto such a piece
ef inter-governmental duplicity: on the basis of the
political risks involved. By the same token, it
appears very unlikely that any country would agree
to accept this Gangerous and troublesome Soviet
agent if they knew what they were getting. Finally,
even if we were somehow able to induce another coun-
try to take Subject off our nands, it is obvious
that at best we would have succeeded in exchanging a
short term, latent problem for actual and persistant
ones. Once legalised in the West, with his movements
uncontrolled and with free communication with his
KGB superiors, Subject would have tremendous opportuni-
ties for creating adverse publicity to the Agency
and creating other serious trouble without ever con-
travening the laws of the country in which he re-
sided. We cannot even exclude the possibility that

a case, the possibilit
ment are almost limitless.

25. Regardlass of where Subject is deported to,
several factors must be considered. Would it be necessary
to serve Subject with a formal warrant of deportation?

Tf so, would he have the right to demand and receive coun-
sel? a

Alternative Course of Action

26. Given sufficient time we believe that we could
persuade Subject to confass. Although there have Leen
certain recent signs of erosion in his ability to stick
to his story, and perhaps even in his will to resist, we
cannot estimate how long a period of time might be re-
quired, but we do not believe that he is prepared to hold
eut forever. Once Subject confessed, we estimate that we
would require approximately a year in which to debrief
him, because it would be primarily from minute examination
ef the details of how anc when he was trained and briefed
by the KGB that we would expect to obtain a better reading
on the true nature and extent of KGB penetration of U.S.
intelligence agencies and activities. During that period
we would still wish to maintain the present circumstances
of handling Subject, and would continue to respond to out~
side inquiries to the effect that Subject fears for his
Rife, doesn't wish to be interviewed, etc. Upen conclu-
sion of this debriefing period--and depending on our esti-
mate of the sincerity and completeness of Subject's
confession--we would then be prepared to provide Subject
a new identity and an opportunity to settle in the U.S.
or elsewhere.

27. Finally as can be seen from the summary in para-
graphs 10-17 aboye, and from the materiel attached in
the tabs, we have coordinated every significant aspect
of Subject's handling with the other U.S. Government agen-
cies who have a direct stake in one or another aspect
of Subject's case. Specifically, we would not contemplate
proceeding with any specific plan to dispose of Subject
without coordinating this with the Department of State,
the Department of Justice and the FBI.

28. We would like the General Counsel's comments
with particular respect to any gaps he may detest in any
aspects of the Agency's. legal position on Subject's case,

saggestions for improving this cositicn, and, specifically,
nis views on whether tie authority for parole granted to
the Diractor in 1955 has been validated or updated by

that the General Counsel's review specifically include
identification of possible legal actions which tne wife

or anyone else could initiate in federal or state courts,
probable legal and publicity consequences of any such action,
and determination of legal defenses and ways of handling -
publicity. In reviewing this case and preparing an opinion
it is requested that the case not be discussed with anyone

outside the Agency.
