according to him, as follows. 2

2. After NPIC had done its fine work during the
Cubdn missile crisis it appears that two different types
of recognition were given. Determinations were made
first on Certain individuals whose contributions were
such that they should receive an Agency medal award. A
second group of some 200 were then identified for their
level of contribution and received some kind of certifi-
cate from the White House signed by the President. Mr.

was in the latter group and espouses the cause

that a “special medallion" should have been given along
with the White House certificate. Mr. also
Spoke to me’ on this matter on Saturday, and has a good

recollection on the whole matter

3. Will you do what you can on the matter and pre-
pare me a letter to be sent to Mr.

John F, Blake
Deputy Director
for
Administration

MGNORANTUM FOR THE RECORD

____]- Rettrea Employee

The meeting vith Mee] on 6 May 1975 vas to satisty hig
qeguset to review bis offizial personnel rile (this matter vas
tetng treated’ in the manner of a request under the Freeda: of
Information Act). Location: Main Reception Interview Roca at

Readquarters Building - 3. p.m.

The-duration of the meeting was one (1) hour of vaich tine
Me lused approximately 7 to 8 minutes to quickly thunb.
thru the OPF. It is my impression that’ he was gurprised: 1) ve
eizy Stowing hin to see all the material in the tile (he cesertbed
viidly, @ 1971 unpleasant encounter vith Me. Rehols, the Director
oF Fersonnel, who refused to show him a document 4nd would onty
Tea to him @ suall portion fron it - this esased his Feq and
subsequent interview with the UCI, Mr. Welma), and 2) at the
reality that the file contained nothing actually derogatory

(ne stated he had geen and signed the fitness reports so these

represented nothing unknown).

The major portion of the time vay consumed tn ny listeaing
to. bis evaluation and assessment of the various supervisors and
Sorwockers at NPIC and their shortcomings. He regaled ne wits
much of bis background and history with the military and initial
arritcation and entrance on duty with the Agency; hia Personal
acquaintance and relationships vith notables - @ foraes Amerizaa
Astassador to Ethiopia, Joseph Simonson, the Enperor of Sthiopia,
several Generals and Congressional Personalities, Mr. Helms ani
hr. Arthur Lundahl, and his membership in the Explorer Club,

Presently he is Vice President for Sales of the Environmental
Coatings Industries: Corporation located in Annandale, Virginia ~
the company removes corroston and stains from surfaces. He
offered the company services at the 17h Alumat session, to
clean the stains from the Nathan Hale statue at the froat of the
building, at a cost of $300. He plans to follov-up on his prow
posal, since he has not heard anything from the Agency.



He mentioned that Mr. Blake,

(1975 Alumni bay) was to explore and advise him [
posalbility of. striktag and issuing a medal to avout

Pereonnel (of whom he ts one) for
aspects of the 1952 Cuban crisis.

Our meeting ended vith mr.)
intention of "going efter anybody,

at the direction of the pcr, |

(_____|) of the
200 Agency

their partictpation in certain

_| indicating he had ‘no

“but he was curious what ‘vas in. .

his file, and that vas the basis for asking to see it.

I concur with the rater's comments. We have been making every effort
to aid Mr.) __\in becoming an asset to RED as a laboratory technician.
fo date, there has been little noticeable progress; in fact, the temper out-
bursts menticned above indicate a deteriorating condition. Unless this
Situation Improves, it may be necessary to recommend tersination action.

As I have stated in previous comments, it's unfortunate that he cannot
find a position which takes advantage of his expertise in photography, since
this would go a long way to resolving his problems.

GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY

oucATIONAL AND Parcnovosica’s

August 24, 1966

“Name: Me, Myroslaw A, Maksymiec

Mr. Myroslaw A. Maksymicc, age 19, came to this Burcau on August 1,
1966, in connection with the Veterans Administration's educational and
vocational counseling progran for former servicemen, Mr. Maksymiee is
marvied, has two children, ages Five and Cight, and is employed by a federal
ceegemmental agency as a’ photographie research technician (G3 09/3). He
rreartd from the United states Army in 1961 in the grade of Master Sergeant
“after serving for over 20 years with primary duties as an intelligence
photographer, His education includes cight ‘years of formal schooling, a
high school completion equivalence certificate, and additional courses with
the Graduate School, Department of Agriculture, and the United States Armed
Forces Institute, Mr. Maksymiec stated that he was interested in further
cducation at the college level in order te improve himself both personally
and professionally in a field related to hic present vocational activities,

In addition to several conferences with the undersigned, Mr. Maksymieo
fas Gdministered a battery of educat tonal and vocational tests. report
Spntains the results. of these conferences and tests, the results of which
should not be interpreted either as conclusive or final. They should be
Spnsidered primarily as. indications of varios psychological factors that
Should be seriously considered by Mr. Maksymiec in making decisions concer-
ning his educational and vocational goals. :

In order to determine Mr, Maksymice's ficlds of vocational ‘interest i
he was given the Kuder Vocational Preference Record, When compared to a :
se egSentative group of men in the national population, Mr. Maksymiec in-
dicated that his interests are ignificantly similar to persons who are
gnsaged in computational, scientific, and jiterary activities. Men who have
interests similar to Mr. Maksymice's ace found in various enginecr ing fields,
astronomy, scismology, ‘economics, Psychology, and technical publ icat tons i
writing. These fields are closely allied to his present occupational endeavors,

On the Educational Inperest Inventory, a device that is beneficial
fo an individual in discovering lis interests in various fields of study,
Mr. Maksymiec's responses indicated that his study interests are very
in physics; high in engineering, chemistry, earth science, and h Story and
political sciences high average’ in communication, zoology, and mathematics;
and average in. psychology. The arcas in which he showed low to average
interest were music, education, industrial arts, agriculture, botany,
Sociology, literature, art, business administration, and economics.



Name: Myreslaw A. Maksymiee

Nr. Maksymiec also took the Amy General Classification Test, Civilian
fdition, to find out his overall lovel of mental, ability. Wis score revealed
that he exceeds approximately 78 percent of adults in general mental capacity
as measured by this instrument, A safer evaluation of his performance ie
that he is probably in the upper 25 percent of alults regarding his global

intelligence,

on the Michigan Vocabulary Profile Test, an ‘instrument that attempts’
fo measure a person's intellcctual interests as well as the amount of infor-
mation he.has retained in various areas of knowledge, Me. Maksymiee indicated,
when compared with college freshmen, that he exceeds approximately 50 percent
in his hnowledge of human’ relations, 69 percent in government, and 67 percent
in the physical sciences. On the lower side, he does as well or better than
2 pereent in his familiarity with commerce, 31 percent in mathematics, and
24 percent in fine arts,

In order to find out Mr. Maksymice’s ability to handle English, a
basic necessity for one to perform well in college, he was given the
Cooperative English Tests. when compared-to college freshmen, he showed that
he execeds from 52 percent to 78 percent in his uneestanding of vocabulary;
from 5 to 17 percent in his ability to comprehend what he reads; from? to
11 percent in his speed of comprchension; and from 18 to 36 percent in his
overall ability to know and understand what he reads under timed conditions.
In his skill to express himself properly in English, he exceeds from 1 to ;
6 percent of college freshmen. When reading and expression are combined !
info one score, it may be said that Mr. Maksymiec exceeds from 6 to 12 per-
gent of college freshmen in his overall usage of Engiish.

I

The results of the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymiec has made |

the most of his learning opportunities both within and outside the military |
service. Although he completed only eight years of school, he has acquired i
a ‘considerable amount of knowledge by observation, reading) and personal |
pxperience. In spite of his broil experiences and acquired knowledge, it will :
be necessary. for him to improve his reading and writing skills in Lnglish, :
however, before he begins cullege courses. Although he manifests a high |
|

|

t

i

|

interest in engineering and scientific fields, he should probably not con-
sider these Ficlds as majors hecmise of his deficiency in mathematics. ft
is believed the skills in English can be devcloped but it is doubtful if
the mathematical deficiencies can’ be overcome sufficiently to major in a
scientific area. It is probably advisable, therefore, for Mr. Maksymice to
consider one of the social scicnces as a college major. His background in
photography and military subjects, combined with a college major in an ap-
propriate Social science, would probably provide him with the necessary
Gualifications to become a geographer or an intelligence analy/st in govern-

ment service,

It_is understood that Mr. Maksymice has enrolled in Montogomery Junior
College, Takoma Park, Maryland, for the 1966 fall semester and that he will

and written expression, After he completes this instruction, he might con=
sider working for an associate of arts degree social science at’ this
junior college with the ultimate goal of tran ferring later to a four-year
college to work toward a bachvlor degree,

I have appreciated knowing and taking with Mr. Maksymice and I trust
he will contact this Burcau if he requires further counseling assistance.
My best wishes go with this report in whatever plans Mr. Maksymice makes
concerning his future plans and goals.

Dear Mr. Lundahl:

While I would like to make public the truly
outstanding accomplishments of the National
Photographic Interpretation Center, I realize
that the anonymity of an orpanization of your
high professional competence in the intelligence
field must be maintained.

I do want you und your people to know of my
very deep appreciation for the tremendous task
you are performing under most trying circum=
stances. The analysis and interpretation of the
Cuban photography and the reporting of your
findings promptly and succinctly to me and to
my principal policy advisers, most particularly
the Secretary of State and the Secretary of

‘Defense, has been exemplary.

You have my thanks and the thanks of your
yovernment for a very remarkable performance of
duty and my personal commendation goes to all of
you.

Sincerely
