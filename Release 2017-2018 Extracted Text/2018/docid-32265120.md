014336

I responded to Judy Miller's office (3-E-854)

in the Pentagon this date and viewed U.S.A.f. file (Regis-

try #4198089), accompanied by a secretary during my inspec-

tion of the file's contents.

Essentially, the subject's file reveals he enlisted

in the United States Air Force 8-30-62 in Dallas, Texas,

for a period of six years.

He received an honorable dis-

charge 8-29-68 at Hensley Field, Dallas, Texas. His assign-

ment as a member of the 136th Ail Refueling Group 75211,

Air National Guard, Hensley Field, Dallas, Texas

changed from Basic Airman to Sergeant (Specialty Account-

ing), but not geographically.

This record goes on to reflect he was born in Dal-

las, Texas, 7-25-40, lived with his mother, Gladys H. Florer

at 3609 Potomac, Dallas (father deceased), attended local

schools ultimately graduating from N.T.S.U. (Denton, twenty

miles north of Dallas) with

B.B.A. in accounting in 1962.

Aside from basic training, he received no special

education while assigned to "Air

Rf1g Go (TAC), Tex ANG,

USNAS, Dallas, Texas."

His service Serial Number is listed as AF 25988326;

Social

Securityl

JFK Act 6 (3) ; married Barbara Watson (dob

10-13-44) 8-28-66 in Wichita Falls, Texas, changing their

residence to 3736 Glencoe, Apartment #117, Dallas, Texas

75206 (later moved to Apartment #202) •

He was promoted to Airman Third Class 11-24-62 and

to Sergeant 11-4-63.

A check of his attendance record discloses he normally

pursued his military career on weekends.

Example: 11-9-63 (Sat.)

11-10-63 (Sun.)

12-7-63 (Sat.)
