2. On 7 May 1973 we were advised by Station WH/Miami that
two employees of a Station WH/Miami proprietary had:told the

tation that one Rene VIERA Gonzalez, a Cuban exile ‘journalist
whe writes for Diario Las Americas and owns. the Westchester
Mali Bookstore in Miaml received a call in early May from one

..{GOTTLIEB is believed to be Sanford GOTTLTES, 11102 ‘Brandywine
St., Kensington, Md. who was formerly an employee of the
National Committee on Sane Nuclear Policy". ‘A pretext call to
the Washington bureau of the New York Times verified: that one
"Sandy" Gottlieb was employed there.) COTTLIEB asked VIERA
vhat people in Miami were saying about the Watergate’ case and

asked about the activities of Reinaldo PICO (former 2506
Brigade member), Orlando PIEDRA (former Chief of Cuban Bureau

was amicably terminated in 1972) and Juan A. PAULA (former
WH/Miami proprietary employee and former Controller of
Revolutionary Democratic Front-FRD-and currently employed by
an OGC proprietary) were still in the Miami area, He wes aiso

(PAULA and Antonio Felix GENOVA Corzo, a WH/Miami proprietary
employee recently purchased a jewelry business) and he knew ~
that Reinaldo PICO had resided in Venezuela and had racently
returned to the United States. The phone conversation lasted
about 45 minutes and GOTTLIEB told VIERA that if he. .cane to

nitially in English but continued in Spanish... VIERA said he
provided no information to GOTTLIEB on the basis that he is a
Cuban exile and did not want to get involved in internal U.S. .

SANJENIS or Juan A. PAULA. (Attached are summary biographies
