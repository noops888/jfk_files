in Chicago. Concerned re: citizenship. Six year association
with JMNAVE. Received six weeks basic tradecraft course

in New York in Sept. 1964. Started work in 1960 for JMWAVE as
Prinicpal Agent, handled a number of political action agents
and spotted and developed several candidates for recruitment
for the Bay of Pigs. Since much of his activity was more overt
