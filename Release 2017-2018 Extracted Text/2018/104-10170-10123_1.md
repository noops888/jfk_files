SUBJECT:

Counter-Revolutionary Organization, 19 February 1971

Alpha 66, and 1ts Activities

• lo

A reliable source of the Miani Field Oftie furnished the following

information.

Alpha 66 was founded in late 1962 or earis 1963 by Eloy Gutterrez

Menoyo, Armando Fleites, Antonio Vectana, Andres Vasario Sargent, De. Diego

Medina and others, as a cover for the Secoud Nativall Eront of Escambray.

3. In 1966. 1t separated from the Second National Front of Escambray.

On 6 Jan 71 Andres Nazario Sargent became the "unice Leader" of Alpha 66.

They are alleged to have 300 active members and 3,100 inactive members. Up

to 6 Jan 71 there vere no ex-members of Brigade =it6 registered as active or

inactive members.

There are professionals, former sealthy men and farmers who

are active members.

Raids against Cuba commenced In 1963, the List raid was in October

1970 in Banes, Oriente Province, where 15 men allegedly Landed.

[c/s Coment:

Sources, arriving on the airlift, hare reported that of these 15 men five

were killed and two taken prisoners at Baire, Ties also said rumors were

that the remaining eight were either killed or. tries prisoners.] There have

been three landings,

one in 1967 and two in 1970, also 14 raids from 1963 to

October 1970. They have also attacked une ship on the high seas and tho ships

while in Cuban harbors. During the attack on the high seas 1l fishermen were

taken prisoners and brought to the US.

They were later returned to Cubil.

These Lindings; raids and attacks on ships have been allegedly corducted to

awaken the dormant status of counter revolutiorn activities and to create

a state of revolutionary conscience within the Cubins who still readin in Cuba.

5.

Some people consider Alpha 66 to be i conster revolulionary organization

with a leftist tendency.

There are rumors that it das a clandestine group, with-

in Cuba, who gathers intelligence informition for it. However, to my knowledge

these rumors have not been confirmed.

6. In mid-1970 the Miani FUl raided the Alpia dó office, and took part of

their files with them.

Apparently Alpha 6ú had deplicates hidden because today

duplicates of the files which the fBI removed are in tneir filing cabinets.

7. On occasions some of their leaders have teen arrested, or interrogated,

but have been

set free soon thereafter.

At the present time aljsha 66 dues not

have the full cooperation nor backing of the majorig of the Cuban exiles.

fact it is very licited.

To my knowledge there is no prominent exile connected

with Alpha 66; the reason being that they are under the impression the organ-

Ization, as a whole, has leftist tendencies.

As far as I know there is no established siltionship between Alpha co

and the "Truth about Cuba Cormittee", nor do I have Jay knowledge that it is

organizing any type of "Cuban Mafia".
