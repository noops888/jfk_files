1. QUESTION: If Fidel should suidenly die or be killed, whst kini of struggle
for power would ensue ani whet element would win out?

2. ANSWER: "Even the gusanos say it would be useless to «ill Fidel; the thicg
would go on. No one thinks Fidel's death woul? be useful to the counter-revolutio:
Maybe it would in the long run, but certainly not in the dort run. It is hari to
what would happen. Power is in the hands of a few people. Some small group (gruzi :
would form and take power strongly into its hands and hold the thing together. W
would heppen tnen is again hard to say; even harder is it to pyedict which elenent
would win out. But generally speasing, the varBudos (and a small group of thes, st
that) would win out, and not the coeminists. In the latter connection, people in
Havana seem to think that Blas Roca and Lazaro Peng are nox longer powerful figures.
Of the old co.cmunists, Carlos Rafael Rodvicuez is the most prestigious. R Nurez
Jimenez could make a comeback, although he is not too important at this time. The -
Minister of Labor, Martinez Sanchez, is very important.
