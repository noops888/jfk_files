Background

ELENA GARRO DE PAZ, OT MISE GARRO as MT. THOMAS calle

her, 19 a well known figure in Mexican political, social and

literary circles.

She was a playwright and well

known to many

officials of the Embassy including the then Ambamandor FULTON

PRESHAN, the then Deputy Chief of Minaion CLARENCE A: BOONTRA,

and many others. All of thome officials expressed to me on

various occasione the opinion that Mins GARIO 1s a vory interesting

vivid imagination and frequently appears to be

waable to distinruinh

between truth and fiction.

Although Interentina, they nil considere

her' as highly unreliable an a source of inferition except for

Mr. THOMAS who apparently placed consistent crodence in what alas

GARRO said.

when miss ankao visited this ofitce in lovember 1904s whe

claimed that she had seen Lal HARVEY OBVALD' at a part alven at

who acquired this intelligence information, I feel a

responsibility for seeing it through to its final evaluation."

It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS has now decided that he

and not the FBI or the Department of Justice is the one to

decide how the story given by Miss GARRO is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-

ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction

of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate the action taken by that agency is, of course,

untenable.

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS' judgment is

raised by item 3 of paragraph 10 of his memorandum furnished to

the Secretary of State.

Any reference to the

relationship between the head of CIA Mexico and top Mexican

officials, if true, is a very highly classified matter and any

"leak" or

revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such

an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political

situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as

to Mexican-American relations.

The delicacy of the situation

has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban

allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in

Havana was

acting as a

Government

Mr. THOMAS, however,

included such a highly

classified reference in

a memorandum which he classified only

as "confidential"

, contrary to regulations relative to classification

of documents.

While this reference relates to the activities and

operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of

primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the

ureau's attention for consideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS

urrent allegations. (9

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded

for, use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to

Dallas which received a copy of referenced letter.
