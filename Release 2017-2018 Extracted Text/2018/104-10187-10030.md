Headquartors will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in

order to cover three Yugoslav lines.

Two of the lines which were disconnected

were Cuban Embasay lines, both were not in uad by the Cubans. One 'as in

the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not uccupied by

other Cubans.

The other was a talephone in the Cuban Embassy which was

never answered.

The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the

Embassy.

They have also asked fos the telephone company to repair 11-92-11.

As soon as thee lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslar

Embassy linea will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish on the

Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and d8 of 18 und 25

September the Yugoslav lines (three).

These transcripts are received sach

norning for the day before. During September, the LIENVOY monitors

transcribed 1396 pages in addition to the daily resumen.

The outside translatora now working on LIENVOY transcripts are

Orville HORSFALL, stalf agent, who is used for almost any backlog which

begina to occur.

David B, SCHLAGETER, field contract igent, who transcribes she

Czech take.

Victor W. OBOLD, Career agent, who trariscribes the Yugoslar portion

of the Yugoslav take.

Douglar T, FFINGLASS, stulf agent. who continues to transcribe the

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad - Federal Sccurity Police

The principal functions of this security untt are to:

(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,

an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and

3) :perform investigatlons and arrests of primarily political

offenses. The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,

insecure, and unrellable.

Their professional characteristics

re best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.

The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as

Director General of DFS 1s precarlous.

10. Politica

A Marxist antl-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in

Mexico, Politica 1s printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,

the same Shop which prints La Voz de Mexico.

In addition to

the modest revenues derived from a circulation of 15,000

to 25,000,

PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy.

that Politica frequently experiences a

great degree of difficulty in printing

of the PRI, the PPS, the

the CNC and the UGOCM.

The MLN's objective Is to gain leftist political represen-

tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists

into its camp.

As a consequence of this objective, the mission

of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and

peasant masses.

MENORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Chief,, Foreign Intelligence

TDY to Mexico CIty

1. Alter taking a good look at LUBNVOY and LIFBAI, I vould agree

with the persona I talked with in Moxico; they maintain that any well-

run tap operation should produce substantial intelligence information,

provided the targets are of intelligence Intorest, and provided aleo

there are people at the station who look for 1t aul are able to racog

nize 1t. The case of LITEAT is Interesting in this respects It has

been deprived of Ila most productive lined in favor of LIERVOX, and

yot 1te Intalligence production compares favorably wit that of the

othar productive tage, except LIENvor.

2. Mexico has people who can detect any little Item of Intel11-

gence significance.

Thile Includes the Chief of Stailon, sho goes over

the highlights of the previoua day's take every morning and marke

cortain items for action by atation case officers or reporta oiiicero:

The reports officors work on copies of the tako at the came time.

3. There are several aspecte of LIENVOY that make it an excellent

operation and an outatanding producer of intelaigence.

I will deacriba

then in detail when uy notes cot here fron the station. The principal

factors in the success of Lusivoy seem to be the following.

a. The agreement unde with top Maxican officials, unlike

many auch agreements elsewbere, lo as mich in effect today as 1t

the targeting le not based on personal politica;

the intercept staff has atayed on the job; the equipment is con-

eldered to be on loan fiom CIA.

b. The native wonttoring staff has reached a peak of effec-

Ivenese that evaryone at the station praises very highly.

HMMW-|1831 dated o August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was

not well informed on the say the Mexico Station exploita operational leade from

LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART has instructiona to alert

¿be Station immediately if a U.S. citizen or English apeaking person tries to

contact any of the target installations. This is done by a telephone call from

outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B. RIGGS inaide the Station.

Emergency neetings are arranged in double talk (inceting for coffee or lunch),

RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a pre-arranged downtown

location and recoives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation.

The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible

for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters is notified by

cable of the action taken. Only in rare casea is information on a U,S, citizen

Other leade appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen. They

also are exploited by the Station case officer responsible for the target where

the lead appears. For example, on le Auguet 1903 Boris KAZANTSEV,

recently arrived Counsclor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target

in Mexico, called his wife at their residence.

The number was not listed but

was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the

number was the switchboard of the martment house where KAZANISEY and

several other families live. The reason the Station checled out this number

was to put unilateral coverage on it if possible; however, the switchboard was

boyond the Station's capability tohandle.

Maryknoll priest Felix McGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on

38 July 1963, MEXI-5565 reported detaile of this contact. This cable was sent

to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Profe88or WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louidiana contacted Mexican

Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marsist intel™

In both of these cases, there sem to have been departure from the

extreme cautlon with which the Mexico Station has alvays handled the LIENVOY

material. Admitting that the cables do not set out enough facte to enable us

to make a final Judgment, ve still feel a little uneady about this use of

LIENVOY material.

In the first case, the Station sent an agent to the suspect's

hotel, posing na a Cuban Embussy official to "trap" him into revealing his

intenttons.

The scheme, which was adnittedly clever, succeeded, but we vere

concerned about what would lave happened if the Cubane themselven had decided

to contact the individual.

Would not the LINVOY operation have been exposed

We crant that the Cubane and other bloc personnel in Merlio

City may suspect LINVOY exists, but they do not know 1t - yet. Incidentally,

we had no traces on the PEPRNER lavolved.

3. The second case involved the detection, spprehension and deportation

of a Cuban Is agent whose whereabouts were learned through LlENvOY.

we cannot really judge the possible riok to

to Heedquarters

before nction was taken.

In general, arrests, deportation,

trapping, or other actlon agalnst security suspects should he approved by llead-

where in the opinion of the Chief of Station, the added tina

needed would seriously impair ODYOKE, socurity or the securlty of our operations.

The Mexico Station has always done this, and the coincidence of two recent cases

where It was. not done inspires us to mery you. Please let us know your views.

LIMMA -21845

On 5 June 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Siaff Agent, arrived in

Mexico to replace Howard G. SA FARANO. the Station translator for Russian

language conversations apocaring on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines. SAFARANO

departed PCS on 18 June thus freeing an Inside slot for use by an operations

FEINGLASS' usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability

to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Soviei coverage. This,

despite Headquarters assurance that he coul do these transcriptions. However,

he has seitled into outside living conditions with a ininimum of difficulty.

For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribingte

Spanish portion of the above take. There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes

numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS

was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish.

The backlog is being

retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. In addition to the Russian trans-

crotions, FEINGLASS also clips the iranscripts for individual dossiers thus

relieving the Siation Case Officer for Soviet opcrations of a clerical task.

After the arrival of HORSFALL, the Mexico Station will revlew requirements

for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of

FEINGLASS.

In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested

full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines. In addition, Thomas G.

URQUIART (ps) while on remporary duty in Mexico was given access to the

LIENVOY tap center io review the traffic on a current basis.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY information.

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided

details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE daca.

In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance

informaiion when reservations were made. Confirmation of the travel Is,

of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might

be U.S. citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for

political or other reasons. On 20 Muy 1963 an English speaker identifying

himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political

asylum for himself, his wife and seven children. Subsequent investigation

revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S, Embassy in Mexico.

Appropriate U.S. agencies were advised of Subject's contact with the Soviet

Embassy.

5. Liaison.

During this reporting period there were no mectings between the

Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular contact was

maintained with LIELEGANT and LIERGO.

(nut not to leave with) LITENSOR. When Chief of Station told LITENSOR that

he was to read the telegram (which concerned GPIDEAL's statements and

position on Cuba) to him, LITENSOR asked if he could dictate what Chief of

Station read to him into his (new) dictaphone. This he did. Both LIl'ENSOR

and LITEMPO/2 were pleased with the strong, definite and concise position of

They were also graccful that Ambassador MANN had got permission

to give them this report.

Catesory station files recoive the clips pertainin;, to soviet commerinal

activities, propaganda activitles,

suviet contacts, etc.

Very often, a sincla

clipping may have to be copied to be sent to the files of several Individual

Suriets and/or to une or nure eaiegury files.

5. Unfortunately, the Station does not have sufficient personnel

to mialyze and collate periodically the LIENVOY and other station

product in the individual Soviet files for transmittal to leadquarters for

Its inforation; or possibly more important, for eventual tranomitial to nother

Station where a Soviet from Mexico City 13 recasioned. Headquarters attention

is directed ainin to MEXI-9885 of 17 January 1962 and allied correspondence

re, arding the desirability of having a trained leadquarters TDYer work on these

aerials at the Station.

Headguarters may now wish to reinventicate the

possibility of finding a quallfied staffer for this TDY acolument.

The Cuban efforts at propaganda in Mexico in winich the Cuban

Ambassador to Mexico conferred with Raul Rod, Cuban Foreign

Minisicr, and suggested to him tha: Fidel Castro vrite a short

message to the Mexican people in Sicilpre On its ninth anniver

sary of publication (see HAINA 19399).

The negarive treatment to a Czech commercial representative

by Mexican Immigracion authorities (see NMALA 19158).

The refusal by the Pan American Institute of Geography and

History of the Organization of American Stats to permit Teresa

Proenza Proenza, Third Secretary and Cultural Artache at the

Cuban Embassy, to atrend the meeting held by i: (see HMM 0438).

The embarrassment caused by lie immoral bchavior of Mexican

female delegates to the Cuban 20 July celebration held in Havana

in 1901 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the periodical

Politica as told io Teresa Proeiza Pruenza.

D. Liaison

With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 2% June - 1 July,

liaison activiries greatly increased. COS visited LITENSOR on 28 June.

LITENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit

and the sufety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the hands ve LITENSOR.

A: this meeting LITENSOR indicated his amoyance with the Cubans, (Sce

NEXT 1253).

LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief of Station a list of persons who

were put under surveillance in connection with the GPIDEAL visit.

The list

also indicated those who were arrested. (Sev MEXis 1241 and 1264).

At a meeting held on 28 May 1962, the Chief of Station, LIELEGAVT,

and LIENVOY/2 met with LIEVVOY/1 and obrained his agreement to hire

LIEVVOY/ 14 10 work under LIENVOX/3 as a technical inspector in Telefonos

de Mexico.

The purpose in putting LIE.VVOX/14 in this capacity is to have a

man who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who "would see

wise others might be rapping telephones" in Telefonos de Mexico. Further-

aure, LIENVOY/1 agreed to see to it that LIENVOY/14 would have "the

range and authority" io do the work.

Putting LIENVOY/I# as a technical inspector within Telefonos, could

create problems for the LIFEAT Project. At the same rime WILSTED is re-

studying the LIFEAT system, improving it, rightening up the security and

alerting the base houses to watch for any abnormal acrivity on present taps.

I: as been understood by the LIENVOl case officer that this has been done

and it will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports.

E. Security

For a report on security of the LIE.WVOY site for June 1962, see

peragraph 2 E of HMMA -19319 (RYBAT-1597) dared 10 July 1962.

As was stated at the end of that paragraph, any surveillance or

security threat of the LIENVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be

handled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Starion in LITENSOR.
