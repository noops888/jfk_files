Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in
order to cover three Yugoslav lines, Two of the lines which were disconnected
were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubana. One was in
the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by
other Cubans. The other was a telephone in the Cuban Rmbassy which was
never answered, The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas! line moved to the
Embassy. They have also asked fos the telephone company to repair 14-92-14,
‘As soon as these lines are worki ain, coverage of two of the Yugoslav
Embasoy linea will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban Lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and ag of 13 and 23
§ eptember the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each
morning for the day before, During September, the LIENVOY monitors

PERSONALITY BRIEF

1. General Lazaro CARDENAS del-Rio

. As a pro-Communist, anti-United States former (1934-1940)
President of Mexico, CARDENAS plays an important role itn the
political activities of Mexico by virtue of his being the
spirtual leader of a great part of the Mexican left, His
leftist sympathies appear to fall primarily with the current
regime in Cuba (He alledgedly is a close personal fiend of
Fidel CASTRO), secondarily with Communist China, and

lastly with the USSR.
2. Braulio MALDONADO Sandez

MALDONADO is a politically unscrupulous pro-Communist
former Governor of Baja California. He is a nutional leader
of at least three Mexican leftist organizations: (1) FEP
(People's Electoral Front), united single front of Mexican
Communists and Leftists; (2) MLN (Nationa} Liberation.
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Cuba Communist Front; and
(3) CCI (Independent Peasants' Center), radical, anti-Mexican
Government organization. Having been banished from Mexico
until after the 1964 elections for anti-government activities,
MALDONADO is currently in Europe and secking admittance to
the USSR, obstensibly to visit his daughter who is a student
at the Friendship University in Moscow,

3. Alonso AGUILAR Monteverde

AGUILAR is a prominent pro-Communist Mexican intellectual
who is the titular head of the MLN (National Liberation .
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Communist front. Me is a
full-time professor at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico and maintains active contact with several international
leftist and Communist figures. He has recently travelled to

Cuba and Warsaw.
4. Jorge Leonidas TAMAYO Castillejos

TAMAYO is a Communist professor at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, Heis a leading member of many Communist
front activities in Mexico including the CMP (Mexican Peace

SUB 273


Committee), the MLN (National Liberation Movement), and the
CEM (Circle of Mexican Studies). He has been in contact with
several leftist figures of various echelon, including Gen.
Lazaro, CARDENAS,.the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, and Polish,
Soviet; and Chinese Communist officials. TAMAYO's son has
studied in Warsaw and travelled to the USSR and Communist

China.
5. Jose David ALFARO Siqueiros

ALFARO, one of Mexico's most prominent artists, has been
imprisoned for eight (8) years as a consequence of the role
he played in the Communist-inspired railroad stike of 1959,
He is a leader of the PCM (Mexican Communist Party) and has
visited the Soviet Union, He fought for the Loyalist Army
in the Spanish Civil War and was later arrested in Mexico
for complicity in the murder of Leon TROTSKY's secretary.
ALFARO has a long history of pro-Communist, anti-U.S. leanings.

6. Roberto ROMERO Adams

ROMERO is an informant for the Cuban Intelligence Service
in Mexico.

7. Enrique GONZALEZ Pedrero

Pro-Communist professor at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, GONZALEZ Pedrero has contributed to the
writing or editing of at least five (5) leftist publications
in Mexico, He is a member of the National Committee of the
MLN, has alledgedly received training in the Soviet Union,
and has travelled to Cuba twice in recent times,

8. Ignacio ACOSTA Lagunss

Pro-Communist ACOSTA, a lawyer, is an aide of General
CARDENAS and a leading member of the MLN, He frequently has
contact with high-level personnel of both the Cuban and
Soviet Embassies in Mexico City. Mis political activities
include travel to Cuba and the Soviet Union, aid in the
management of the Communist Trade Fair in Mexico, and a great
deal of participation in promoting sympathy for the Cuban

Revolution in Mexico,


-3-

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad ~ Federal Security Police

The principal functions of this security unit are to:

(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,
, (2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and

(3) .perform investigations and arrests of primarily political
offenses, The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,
insecure, and unreliable. Their professional characteristics
are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.
The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as
Director General of DFS is precarious,

10, Politica

A Marxist anti-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in
Mexico, Politica is printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,
the same shop which prints La Voz de Mexico. In addition to
the modest revenues derived from a circulation of 15,000
to 25,000, Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the
MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy, AS an
indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the
capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it
is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a
great degree of difficulty tm printing and circulating itself
due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,
the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual
interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the
ranks of the PRI, the PPS, the PCM, the CNC and the UGOCM.

The MLN's objective ts to gain leftist political represen-
tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists
into its camp. As a consequence of this objective, the mission
of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and
peasant masses,

12, Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)

The CTAL has recently been replaced by the CUTAL (Single
Confederation of Latin American Workers). Until recently, the


pro-Communist, CTAL, which is described as being the liaison
bureau of the WFTU (World Federation of Trade Unions) whose
headquarters are in Prague, was headed by Vicente LOMBARDO

Toledano.

13. Prensa Latina

Operatiéng directly under the Cuban Communist regime,
Prensa Latina is obstensibly a press service. In reality,
however, it is the official propaganda organ of the Cuban
Government. Prensa Latina works closely with Tass, the
Soviet Agency; with Hsinhua, the Chinese Agency;and with
Cetepka, the Czechoslovakian Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence
SUBJECT: TDY to Mexico City

1. After taking a good look at LIRNVOY an4 LIFEAT, I vould agree
with the persons I talked with in Mexico they maintain that any well-
run tap operation should produce substantial intelligence information,
provided tho targets sre of intelligence interest, and provided aleo
there are people at the station who look for it and are able to recog-
nize it, The case of LITBAT is interesting in this respects It has
been deprived of its woat productive lines in favor of LIZHVOY, and
yet ite intelligence production coapares favorably, with that of the
other productive taps, except LIENVOY.

2. Mexteo has people who can detect any little itew of intelli-
gence significance. This includes the Chief of Stacion, who goes over
the highlights of the previous day's take every morning and marke
certain {tems for action by station case officers or reports officers.
The reports officers work on copies of the take at the came time.

3. ‘There are several aspects of LIENVOY that make it an excellent
operation and an cutstanding producer of intelligence. I will describe
thea in detail when ay notes cot here fro the station. The principal
factors in the success of LIRSVOY seem to be the following. -

@. ‘The agreement mede with top Maxican officials, unlike
many such agreenents elsewhere, 1@ aa mich in effect today as it
was at the start: the targeting 19 not based on personal politica;
the intercept staff has stayed on the Job; the equipaent is con-
sidered to be on loan from CIA.

b. ‘The native monitoring staff hue reached a peak of affec-
tiveness that evaryone at the station praises very highly.

c. ‘The station is organized to handle the tuke speedily as
soon ag it comes in. The Chief of Station, the case officers, the
reports officers, all work on it at the same time and excnange
views on hot items. They de not let reports backlogs accumulate,



Sen

4. Bach new item ono target person is linked to a past
histery; what appears as a fraguentary bit in a- conversation
becases a peaningful developesnt, in a contimuous story. Contie
muity on the Job makes this possible.

@. ‘The equipwent is kept in gocd vorkiug order by complete
cleaning dod checking of each unit once a month. The 32 unite
in use today are those installed in 1959.

4k, .A detailed description of LIBNVOY and its counterpart LIFRAT
should provide good models with vhich to compare other tap operations.
It chould give criteria for good procedures. It ahould givs some. idea
of. the desirable size of such operations, considering the available
targets, the size of the atation, and the other taske and operations of
the station. It should shov viat the station puts into ite tep opera-
tions and what it gets out of then. LIENVOY and LIFKAT are an interesting
example of two interacting operations, one Joint and the other independ.

ent.

5. My otay in Mexico was as interesting and fruitfil as it was
enjoyable. And I hope it was not too great a burden oa the station.

12 September 1963

Dear Willard:

This may seem to you like a voice out of the void, but I
always carry in my mind your repeated invitations to visit you
and remember clearly your acquaintance and kindness to ay
brother, Strangely enough it seems to continue to be true
that the only escape from this jail-like desk is back to ny
old area where I nevor expected to return--I even had one this
Spring. Just now I have a specific reason for wanting to
visit your place, that is, in addition to our own personal

reasons,

For some time I have boon bent on trying to push for sore
positive information from taps and audio, I realize taat it
de taken for granted around the world that the purpose of taps
anc audio is for operational leads, particularly in the KUDESS

field,

In one or two places in the world, positive production is
outstanding and have beon making a study gor sowe time
trying to see why it works in some cases and not in others.
One of the outstanding examples is LIFEAT and especially LISX¥OY.
Tnese seen to be far ahoad of other similar operations around
the world even though they eeem to approach the problem
sonevhat similarly. It occurred to mo that we might find out
what makes yours so especially effective by having one of ay
people go to your station for a few days to talk with you and
your officers and get the detailed story, I could then take
another look at the other operations and see what's missing or
what's wrong, I'm suro this would be of great help to the
place as a wnole, If you agree, I will send Paul V. Levister
(iden), the editor of our Foreign Intelligence Series (our
Btaff doctrinal papors, the first few of which have been
dispatched to you), He could be in Mexico City on or about
23 September, or any time thereafter that is more convenient
for you and your people, Could you let us know your reaction
by cable, and 1f it's favorable, when you would prefer to have
levister arrive, Ye would confirm his ETA by cable.

On 7 August 1963 the Station EE case officer requested LIENVOY coverage of
the Yugoslav lines, Arrangements are being made to put these Lines in within

the near future,
3. Processing of LIENVOY Information,

The Station continues to receive full transeripta in Spanish from ten
Lines (five Cuban Embassy aad five Soviet Embaasy), DIR-60764 dated
13 August 1963 aeked the Station to send to Headquarters one copy of the full
transeripts from the Cuban Embassy lines, These are being forwarded on a
weekly basis, The first group is being forwarded as an attachment to HMMA=22000
dated 21 August 1963, If they do not please Headquarters officers who desire
them, it is requested that the Mexico Station be promptly advised with any

suggestions for changes,

On 6 August 1963 Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, arrived in Mexico
to work presently ag a unilateral monitor but eventually as the supervisor of
a tap center either under LIENVOY or LITEMPO. He has established himself
outside and ie presently at work eliminating the backlog of Sovict tapes,

Douglas J, FEINGLASS continues to do the Russian from LIENVOY,
the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from
the LIPAWN audio operation, In addition, FEINGLASS sends clipped transcripts

to the Station ready for 201 files.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Informatign,

HMMW-l1831 dated 6 August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was
not well informed on the way the Mexico Station exploits operational leads from
LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART haa instructions to alert
the Station immediately if a U.S. citizen or English speaking person tries io
contact any of the target installations, This is done by a telephone call from
outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B. RIGGS inside the Station,
Emergency nwetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch).
RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a presarranged downtown
location and receives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conver sation,
The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible
for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters is notified by
cable af the action taken. Only in rare cases is information on a U.S, citizen
passed without prior Headquarters approval.



CONTINUATION OF

‘DISPATCH HIMMA#22005

Othet lvade appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen, They
also are exploited by the Station case officer responsitle for the target where
the lead appears, For example, onl Auguat 1903 Boris KAZANTSEV,
recently arrived Counsclor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target
in Mexico, called hie wife at their residence, The number was not listed but
was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the
number waa the switchboard of theapartment house where KAZANTSEV and
several other families live. The reason the Station checked out this number
was to put unilateral coverage on it if pousible; however, the switchboard was

beyond the Station's capability tohandle,

Maryknoll priest Felix McGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on
$i July 1965, MEXI-5565 reported details of this contact. This cable was sent
to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Professor WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louisiana contacted Mexican
Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel=
lectual and professor at the University of Mexico, and arranged to meet with
him on 31 July 1963, MEXI-5563 reported this contact to Headquarters for
dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Bartolo (fnu) contacted former Governor of Baja California, Braulio
MALDONADO Sandez on 16 July 1963 regarding the sale of Cuban pesos. MEXI~5569

1. The referenced cables describe tvo recent incidents in which the
Mexico City Stution made use of LIENVOY information to take investigative or
punitive action against security suspects. ‘The first reference reported the
Adentifying end ."tropping" of a PRPEIME citizen who was offering his services
to the Cuban Exbassy, and the second reported the deporting of a Cuban IS
agent identified by LIENVOY material.

- . 2+ In both of these cases, there svems to have been departure from the
extreme caution with which the Mexico Station has alvays handled the LIEWVOY
material. Admitting that the cables do not set cut enough facts to enable us
to make a final Judgment, ve still feel a little uneasy bout this use of
LIENVOY material. In the first case, the Station sent an agent to the suspect's
hotel, posing as a Cuban Fmbussy official to "trap" him into revealing his
intentions. The scheme, vhich was admittedly clever, succeeded, but ve vere
concerned about what vould lave happensd if the Cubans themselves had decided
to contact the individual. Would not the LIENVOY operation have been exposed
to sane extent? We grant that the Cubans and other bloe personnel in Nexivo

City may suspect LIENVOY exists, but they do not know it --- yet. Incidentally,
ve had no traces on the PEPRIMER tavolved.

3. The second case involved the detection, spprehension and deportation
of a Cuban IS ogent viose whereabouts vero learned througa LIENVOY. Fron the
fev facts ve know about this cane, we cannot really judge the possible risk to
LIBNVOY. The Mexico Station created LIENVOY and has alvays guarded ite security j
with scrupulous care. Has there been « change?

|

4, Finally, pleasenste that both these cases should have been reported
to Heedquarters before action was taken. In general, arrests, deportation,
trapping, or other action against accurity suspects should be approved by Head-
quarters, except where in the opinion of the Chief of Station, tho added time
needed vould seriously impair ODYOKE security or the security of our operations.
‘The Mexico Statica has alvays done thia, and the coincidence of two recent cases
vhere.1t was.not done inspires us to query you. Please let us knov your views. i

O1PATCH 1

On 5 Jame 1963 Douglas J, FEINGLASS, Staff Agent, arrived in

Mexico to replace Howard G, SAFARANO, the Station translator for Russian

language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines, SAFARANO

departed PCS on 15 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations

officer, FEINGLASS’ usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability

to transcribe the Spanish portion of the recls from the Soviet coverage. This,

despite Headquarters assurance that he coull do these transcriptions, Howeveg,
_ he has scitled into ourside living coadizions with a minimum of difficulty.

- For the present, a monitor from tae LIENVOY tap center is transcribing he
Spanish portion of the above take, There is a Station backlog of Sovict tapes
numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS
was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish, The backlog ts being
retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives, In addition to the Russian trans-
crptions, FEINGLASS also ellps the cranscripts for individual dossiers thus
relieving the S.ation Cas¢ Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task,
After the arrival of HORSFALL. the Mexico Station will review requirements
for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of

FEINGLASS,

In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested
full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines, In addition, Thomas G,
URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the
LIENVOY tap center co review the traffic on a current basis,

4, Exploitation of LIENVOY information,

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided
details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE dara,
In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance
information when reservations were made, Confirmation of the travel ts,
of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

‘The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might
be U.S, citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for
political or other reasons. On 20 May 1963 an English speaker identifying
himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political
| asylum for himself, his wife and seven children, Subsequent investigation

revealed that he was also a protection case at the U,S, Embassy in Mexico,
Appropriate U,S, agencies were advised of Subject's contact with the Soviet
Embassy.

5, Liaison,

During this reporting period there were no mectings between the
Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular contact was
maintained with LUELEGANT and LIERGO,

6, Security,

There were no security incidents within the project during this
month, As reported in MEXI-5S170, 26 June 1963, the true name of a
KUBARK case officer was revealed co the Cuban Embassy by a caller who
refused to identify himself, From the transcript it apgeared that the Cuban
Embassy was not interested in making comiact with the caller who claimed to

have details of KUBARK operations in Mexico,

the next few weeks,

8. Personnel, ae

‘On 17 June Robert B, RIGGS resumed meciing Arnold A REHART and]
routine case officer functions for LIENVOY, Gregory PARMUTH meets
Douglas J. FEINGLASS daily to deliver and receive the Soviet Embassy
traffic, PARMUTH's assistance in obiaining living quarers and necessary
sterile office furniture was responsible for the case with which FEINGLASS
was able to se:tle into his.ourside staff agent status,

In the opinion of Thomas G. URQUHART, who has spent some tine
inside .h2 cap center, Arnold F, AREHART is doing a commendable job In
the management of the center, - In addition, AREHART has a general aware-
ness of the take from each line, When leads of tnierest appear, he notifies
the Scatton immediately so that action can be taken,

Willard C, CURTIS contacts LIENVOY-2 when the Station desires
coatact with the Mexicans directly or when AREHART is absent,

1. Transmitted herewith, for purposes of Headquarters faniliarizaticn,
is a typical one day LIENVOY product of the Soviet lines. (iste that the
Station has additional LIFEAYT coverae on the personal lines ef colonel
Aleksandr .icor;;iyevich SIDOROV and Svyatoslav Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, and on the

office line of Vludimir Ivanovich SAMOKHIN).

2. Except for the weekend period, the Spanish languace transcript
reaches the Soviet case officer on the day followin; the actual transcription ~
at the most usually two days after the transcription. ‘the Station's Russian
Jencua;e translater.transcrives the Russian language portions innediately, and
thio product reaches the Soviet case officer about an hour or two after receipt
of the Spanish reporting. Simultaneously, flimsy copies of the above have been
yiven to the reports officer and to other interested Station offizers. The
first copy is kept in a Station chrono file, for purposes of perzanent record.

It Lo annotated for ZOMAR purposes.

3. ‘he Soviet officer, Lucy A. DillinGr, and other cfficers, read the
product quickly for the Lmmediate purpose of obtuinin.; exploitable LCIMPROVE

or other operational leads, and/ur reportuble intellixence, Arter this initial
ping of sisnificant

acanninz, the product is literally cut up, with each e.
conversation sent to COS and to various Station officers for their infornation
and/or action. Whenever pertinent, the actual LIENVOY clip is seat to Head-
quarters, for inforsation or action - or a owunmry of the clip is sent to
Headquarters in dispatch form. Each clip is eventually routed to the Station's
rejistry where indexiny and filin; is corpleted.

4, ‘The Station finds that this Soviet LIENVOY clipping program provides
the files on the individual soviet staffers with a rather yocd ricture of their
activities and personality. (‘These individual files are of ccurse aumented
with information derived from double agent operations, LIEMPIY reporting, Head
quarters provided information, ODASID reportin;,, newspaper clippings and other
miscellaneous reporting). In many cases, however, the backbone cf a Station

file on a Soviet may derive principally from bite and pieces of LIRWOY product.

is directed azain to MEXI-9005 of 17 January 1962 and allied correspondence
recarding the desirability of having a trained Headquarters TDYer work on these

‘The Cuban efforts at propaganda in Mexico in wrici the Cuban
Ambassauor to Mexico couferred with Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign
Minister, and st Fidel Castro write a short
message to the Mi n people ii on its ainth anntver=
sary of publication (see HMMA 1.

The negative treatment to a Czech commercial representative
by Mexican Immigration authorities (sce HMMA 19158),

The refusal by the Pan American Inszitute of Geography and
History of the Organization of American States to permit Teresa
Proenza Proenza, Third Seeretary and Cultural Attache at the
Cuban Embassy, to attead the meeting held by i (see HMM 6438).

The embarrassment caused by thg,immoratbetavior of Mextcan
female delegates to the Cuban 26 July celebration held in Havana
in 1961 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the perlodical
Politica as told to Teresa Proenza Proenza,

D. Liaison

With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 29 June - 1 July,
laison activities greatly increased, COS visited LITENSOR on 28 June,
LITENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit
ad te safety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the haads of LITENSOR,
this meeting LITENSOR iuicated his aaaoyance with the Cubans, (See
XU 1253),

LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief of Station a list of persons who
were put under surveillance tn connection with the GPIDEAL visit, ‘The list
also indicated those who were arrested, (Sec MEXIs 1244 and 1264),

Acta meeting held on 25 May 1962. the Chief of Station, LIELEGANT,
and LIENVOY/2 met with LIENVOY/L aad obtained his agreement to hire
LIENVOY/14 to work under LIENVOY/3 as a cechnical in: ‘or in Telefonos
de Mexico, The purpose in putting LIENVOY/L4 in this capacity is to have a
: who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who “would see

others might be tapping telephones” in Telefonos de Mexico, Further-
more, LIENVOY/1 agreed to see to it that LIENVOY/14 would have "the
range and authority” io de the work,

Putting LIENVOY/14 as a technical inspector within Telefonos, could
create problems for the LIFEAT Project, At the same time WILSTED is re~
studying the LIFEAT system, improving it, tightening up the security and
alerting the base houses to watch for any abnormal activity on present taps,
It tas Deen understood by the LIENVOY case officer that this has been done
ic will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports,

E, Security

For a report on security of the LIENVOY site for June 1962, see
peragraph 2 E of HMMA-19319 (RYBAT-1S92) dated 10 July 1962,

As was stated at the end of that paragraph, any surycillance or
security threat of the LIENVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be
dled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Starica to LITENSOR,

Remembering the other Fiat at the end of the block, which waa quite
visible from the corner of Panuco ard Ifuison, the urdernigned decidad
to delay entry into the safehouae and casually walk down the block.

The undersigued cut across Hudeun Streez tu avoid walking close to the
parked car and as he walked on Lerma, noticed the prasence of a alow
moving car behind him, This did avt arouse tow much suspicion siace

“this area apparently specializes in street walkers and the local "tenories™

came abrest of the car and the driver almost stopped and stared at the .

noted aa he made tha sudden turn inte Mississippi that the other vahicle
braked as soon as he passed Minsteaippi and, tt seemed to the under=
signed, was backing up toward Misaiavippi, At thia point the undersigned
poured the coal into the old Green Hornet and left the area, The ondere

about. ‘The evidence ve turned over to Didc Orcas has psyctiological impertance
vecause President is now aware that DIAc Ordaz also knows part of the story.
He oan vevor be sure that DIAZ Omias will not use this te pupport his oun

“anti-comuniot convictions if a showxiown betwen tus Comiea and antt-Connies

should occur in Mexico,

4. fIA2 Ordas has apked ns through CAS whether I wo.dd have any objection
if the informaticn wa furnished hin were made public ahould an azprocriate
occasion arise in the future. he said there vould be no mention of the U.S.
Gevt and that Cobermeion vould present tha evidence as collected by ite

5. I recommend that CAS and [ent authorize me to inform DIAL Ordas that
we have no objection on the basis ouclined by him. Season for my recemmend-
ation ie that on the one hand ve lows little by blowing tho microphone oneration
einca battery is cohedulod to expira soon in any cass, We believe we are ina
position where we can safely deny thet wo had anything te do with placing microe
phone. In this connection Diss Oras obviously believes our story that wo
pieked up signal by routine dialing of different frequencica and that microphone
was presumably laced by Soviets to check on their satellites. on othar hand
affirmative answer to DIAZ Orda will also implicitly suggest the vosstbility
that the time may come when we ourselves aight wish to make this inforsation

public, I can think of no better incentive to Lopes Matcoo to break relations
with Cuba than possibility Mexican public might eventually become aware of
extont te which Mexico has tolerated Cuban intervention in spite of ite vaunted
devotion to the doctrine of non-intervention.

6, Finally I wish to say that I realise all of these mansuvers involve
some risk to U.S. but I believe resurgence of Communist influence in last two
months requires unusual counteraction on our part.

7. DIAZ Ordas has returned material to CAS for safe keeping and it is
now in our possession, He claims he made no copies and we believe this probably
