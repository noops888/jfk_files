stout in build and has dark skin "like that of a Hindu."

2. Although the names reported in this dispatch and reference are not

the same, perhaps

they could be tied together as the one reported in reference

could have been garbled in transcription. Until we have confirmed the identity

of the two in question, we shall work under the assumption that there are, in

fact, two people Involved.
