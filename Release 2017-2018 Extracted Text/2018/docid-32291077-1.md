LEGAT WAS LED TO BELIEVE RICARDO WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF DISIP AND

ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED THAT RESULTED IN THE PROMPT ISSUANCE OF A

VISA TO THE TORRES AGUDO CHILD

(g)

RICARDO RECONTACTED LEGAT A FEW WEEKS LATER TO EXPRESS HIS

APPRECIATION FOR ASSISTANCE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED, AND LEGAT THEN BE-

CAME AWARE RICARDO WAS MERELY AN AUXILIARY MEMBER OF DISIP, AND THAT

HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE PERSONAL SERVICE OF LUIS POSADA RICARDO RE-

VEALED HE WAS ALSO A NEWSPAPER REPORTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER AFFILIATED

WITH THE MAGAZINE "VISION," AND INDICATED HE DEVOTED MOST OF HIS TIME

RESEARCHING NEWS ARTICLES INTENDED TO DISCREDIT THE CASTRO GOVERN-

MENT. HE CLAIMED PARTIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NEWSPAPER ARTIQE THAT

TIVE AND TERRORIST ACTIONS BY ANTI-CASTRO GROUPS IN THE US. RICARDO

CONSULATE IN PORI-OF-SPAIN. LEGAT ADMITTED THERE WAS NO SUBSTANTIVE

EVIDENCE OF RICARDO'S IMPLICAT BUT THAT THE COINCIDENCE OF HIS

FRESENCE THERE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, COUPLED WITH HIS EMPLOYMENT

RELATIONSHIP WITH LUIS POSADA, HAD GIVEN LEGAT CAUSE TO WONDER.

THE DISIP OFFICIAL RELATED DISIP HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE RICARDO WAS
