lack of financial forward planning. ICPIPIT believes that it would

be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a

portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both

life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-

cussed this with

V1 and he has agreed to the desirability of

such a program.

He is willing to participate in such an arrangement

and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.

We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals

which he has received from the local representative of a reputable

WOLADY insurance fimm.

2. ICPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the

cost of a life insurance program forL

V1. (This WOFIRM portion

not to exceed $50 per month.) From an administration standpoint

this would merely take the form of an increased monthly paywent and

we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were

indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW -

during the reduction of files attendant upon the LCPIPIT move,
