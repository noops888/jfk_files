1. After considering several alternatives and given
lack of financial forward planning, LCPIPIT believes that it would
be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a
portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both
life insurance and_a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-
cussed this with yu and he has agreed to the desirability of
such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement
and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.

We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals
which he has received from the local representative of a reputable
WOLADY insurance firm. :

2. _LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the
cost of a life insurance program for[_Vl. (This WOPIRM portion
not to exceed $50 per month.) From an administration standpoint

this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and
we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were
indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

while they reserve finite comment until all the returne (per above) are in, the
Medical Staff did stress the paramount importance ‘Bloper reet and of not over-
taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular,
warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed,
and complete absence of alcohol, in order to prevent a relapso, So long 2s these
caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some
more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However. since he
also has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the
offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimum for the
time being.

as carried on “OFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary
and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Head-~
quarters to discharge! Vi's WOLADY tax
obligation. These taxes are remitted through the
Covert Tax Committee. This procedure was devised
to honor the original "tax free” commitment made
at the time of his recruitment and at the same

citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT. a ae

to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.

cial entitlements to be funded to him by QRPURE, which has also

» agreed to repatriate|| ‘1 to WOLADY. This has been done
for operational reasons to enable ‘1 to qualify for
foreign residence. Should QRPURE obliged to honor this commit-
ment, WOFIRM will guarantee this QORPURE commitment and will
reimburse QRPURE for any costs incurred.

of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-

its provisions are still in effect.

describes an internal WOFIRM procedure; certain aspects of para-

Until April of this year (1968), I lived mainly on assistance
from my wife's family and occasional freelance journalism

Stamford Brook, London, W.12 for us —= the price of the
house being considered a loan to be repaid over the years

as is possible. My children’s school fees were paid by
convenant by my brother-in-law, as well as a grant in
convenant to my youngest daughtere

I was not a legal resident of the U.K. until 8 April

This revision reflects most of the suggestions made in Reference A.

2. As said in Reference B, Wi. does not fall into the
category of WOPIRM asset usually handled by LCPIPIT. This fact
plus the very stringent security considerations which must apply
to this operation dictate that certain proced:re be followed in”

a case. Handling of this case has been facilitated by

2. yiis employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965,

was originally formalized by a Letter of Agreement for a period

of three months, replaced by a Memorandum %f Oral Commitment dated -

1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains in effect (as
amended) since that date, ‘1*s employment continues on a

month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a

30-day notice.

3. [____)1 receives the following financial entitlements:

a. Compensation so computed as to give[_—*(Vl a
“tax-free“ income of $800 per month (this figure
effective 1 July 1967).

NOTE: The actuai breakdown of Yi's finances
as carried on WOFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary

and $70 per month tax su nt withheld at Head-
quarters to discharge 1's WOLADY tax’ ”

obligation. These taxes are remitted through the
Covert Tax Committee. This procedure was devised
te honor the original "tax free" commitment made
at the time of his recruitment and at the same
time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY
citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.

b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel

agreed to repatriate| 1 to WOLADY. This has been done
for operational reasons to enable[ Yl to qualify for

MEMORANDUM FOR: CCS/NC

SUBJECT: ORPURE/__J/1 Relationship

1, This will confirm our conversation of 18 September 1967, in
which we discussed| /t"s plan to visit CRPURE some time

during the week of 25 September 1967, and you agreed to give CRPURE/2

prior warning of this visit. In accordance with the same conversation
/l was briefed that his visit should be mainly a question of

o- but that no substantive discussions affecting thir ostensible rela-
tionship (i.¢., amount of money, amount of| y

ORPURE, ete.) were to take place. You were to brief CRPURE/2
along the same Lines, and alco to indicate to him that, contrary Teal

original thinking, we would now like to havel /1 givens
whenever ORPURE/2 feels he can do so.

2, In addition to the above, we would appreciate it if you would
take up with ORPURE/2 (and/or ORPURE/1, a2 appropriate) the pos-
sibility of increasing the amount of money funded de pmeemmene via
ORPORE. As indicated to you, we would like to increase the current
$100.00 monthly to $300.00 monthly, but would like your careful
examination with QRPURE principal(s) that this amount Is not exces-
sive elther in terme of their willingness to handle or in terms of
CRPURE's ostensible ability to cover.

and our thought of perhaps including

GRPURE (along with other] as a name on the door or on
bie letterhead, Would QRPURE/2 (or CRPURE/1) have say objections?
Would he have any objections if any of the other names are of more

It would not be operationally feasible or desir-

able to let him know in advance which these would be, but since both

QRPURE's have been briefed carefully ast 1's

Ithese might be.

4. For operational reasons, we would prefer that the arrange-
mente indicated in paras 2 and 3 above not be broached until after

finances as carried on WOFACT books is $700 monthly salarys
$100 non-accountable operational allowance; $70 tax supple-
ment withheld at HOS to discharge ‘l*s WOLADY tax
obligation. These taxes are remitted through the Covert
Tax Committee.

b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel,
unless these are reimbursed by other sources in which case
WOPACT will offset such outside reimbursement against WOPACT -
financial obligations to yi. Since security considera—
tions generally preclude letailed accounting for mis- ‘
cellaneous travel expenses, per diem will be paid at the
Bate of §20 per day during periods of authorized travel.

This per diem authorization was qualified by a
ruling of Chief of Station, yicrEPiT dated 12 July 1965:

*1f subject is absent from his home station on
authorized travel for part of one day and returns to _

his home station the night of the dame day (i.e. if F

Approval applicable to[____/l- We do have a copy of the -
Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW -

during the reduction of files attendant upon the LCPIPIT move,
or possibly it was inadvertantly not forwarded to LCPIPIT. At
any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy.

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI of

REP: A. PALP $933 (Ul 96553)
B. OFLA 3128 (18 Hovember 1965)

1. We have discussed the substance of the question raised

in Hef B through the regular Headquarters channel with
QDENVY Rop bere who has acted as a point of liaison for
material in the past. fo passed on, also, the satorials whic!

you propared for the ODENVY representative with whom you are
rt Conrece: in We raised spocifically the question of
pass: identity to the jODzNVY representative,
which you montionod in of B, stating t, B80 Zar as KUDARK
is » ve had no objections. The ODSHVY representative
here, however, thought that this might serve to confuse goac-
whet the lines of coordination for| jantormation, for
which ODENVY headquarters kas sole responsibility. Ue there-
fore felt that we sbould continue tho present arrangozent by

which, in effect, identity is beld here at the point
whore his material within originates. He appreciated,
however, your initiative in filling in tho Fise'g

jon:
representative on the tarcots which] lean sorvice, thus
alerting hia to possible leads he might look into. Ho suygests.
also that we be kept avare of your liaison with ODENVY in the
field to guard sainst false confirmation or other possible
duplication which could lead to confusion here in
quar aoe of QDEHVY responsible fer processing the
patorial.

2. With respect to [tiscussed in Ref 4,
and Q's possible relat: DW: + We will report separately.

individuals end groups in vartous countries.

3. From the beginning, 1 has proved wore than satisfactory as an
agent. ke hae carried out assignaents given to hin with knowledge and tact and
the proper spirit, has used his own initiative as much as our guidance, and has:
not violated our instructions, No one will argue that ne hasn't proved to be
better than we collectively thought be would be, and in terms of his om
abilities—apart from targets which may or may not be accessible to him-—he is
getting better all the tize,

4, Last year, about a year later than Ji etsht have expected his
salary to go up from $600 to $800, we raised it to $793, He was pleased, and he
has not conplained as euch as he used to about a shortage of fumds, (Presumably

lis responsive to the generally good treatment he has had, to the :
respect for hin as sn fodividual and tie appreciation of hie services; probably
he {8 carried along as such by bis own personal satisfaction in knowing he is
weeting requiresents and continually breaking new ground.)

S. Nevertheless, LCPIPIT believes the time has coue to raise frre
salary to the prosised level, We can all agree that ve are still setting bis
services cheap; 1 receives no quarters, living allowance, or educational
allowance for his children, His increased gratitude, the relief he will undoubt—
edly feel at being able to reduce his present financial vorries, are more than
worth the extra $100.

A source of this Bureau who has furnished reliable
information in the past recently advised that during the :
Fall of 1966, a member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marsist- fiat
Leninist organization stated that one . ji
suspected of being a spy for the Central Intelligence agency . fee
According to this individual, recently had been in
in the company "Of a female secretary from Paris,

jome is in New Rochelle, New York, At that time

remarked his travel and activities were possible
ecause he had married a wealthy English woman, Other things
were said which aroused the suspicions of the Italian.

According to our source, the Italian pro-Chinese
~Leninist subsequently relayed his suspicions concerning
ito Rene Raindorf, a member of the Central Committee

of the Communist Party of Belgium (Marxist-Leninist).

he had indicated the Belgian pro-Chinese
communists would look into the charges of the Italian Marxist~
Leninist.

based, hovever, only on preliminary file checks and investigation and is sub-
ject to a further final reviev when all investigation is completed.

(2) Requirements passed to Subject will be confined, insofar as it is opera-
tionally feasible, to instrictions for the refinement and compleveness of the reporting

operational assigazeazs supporting or servicing other AUEARK’ Operations, nor will he
participate directly and/or viztinsly in cbe spottin: ead/or recraicueat of other ageat¢.

(3) In addition to this bacsground, cercain of Subject*s past statenents and
behavior are inconsisven with, and give rise to en sacertainty about, che navire and
degree of his presen:ly professed motivations and lcyalties. It is impossible to
resolve this uncertainty with the nowledse now avaiiabie. At the present time,
therefore, it is believed that his bona fides have not been estadlished to an extent
which vould varrent handling him in any vay than "at arms length”.

4, Q feels that she is enotionally unstable--his firmess in dealing vith
her, his making {clear he was not out for ner body, have made him a guardian
and true friend. She seems to be a good political reporter, understanding ber
own (confused) political yearnings and where her various contacts stand; she =
also seems to have a good memory for details. Q says that her “anti-revisionisn”
is incipient anti-Communism, He could eventually recruit her as an ODYOXE witting
Sgent, but that would take a lot of time and trouble; with mich less effort he
could effect a| nd indeed, he nas already done this on an
informal basis by making it clear that he was for his
friends, She would undertake further assignnents for aim, ie actually asked her,
“Suppose I asked you to go souewhere, would you go?" To which she replied, "If

it's not cold." It {s unlikely, however, that she would be able to return to

because off ——sifhostility. Wherever she goes, her main asset will be ber
physical attraction,

5. She could be debriefed further on any point raised in the tape interview.
The ideal would be to have the questions by the time Q goes to lin the second
half of April, but thie does not seem to be a likely possibility.
