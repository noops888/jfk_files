and tho undersigned) consijer him nost dependable ard deserving of addi- ©. -
tdonal responsibility. He has show great initiative and application in
his duties with the LIPSTICK team.

2. He will graduate from a local college the beginning of June 1955 and

4s considering accepting employment with a PBPRIME firm in Mexico City.

Ag-all young men vho have just graduated from college, he is looking for .
employment with a fiture and with sono degree of security. He. has indi-

cated his desire of vorking for KUBARK on a full-time besia end it is

thie Mission's desire to so employ him, It is presently ccutemplated

that he will assume the duties of Jeromo K, NASHWDNTER in charge of the :
LIPSTICK team, working in association with LIFSTICK-19, Chaster D. FOLLI= ©

suited to assume, He will be given LIFINGER credentials with which be +

will be able to backstop the team ani also to engage in investigative work “-'/
for the solution of leads which the surveillance produce, ,

3. As has been stated in paragraph 2 above, he is desirous of accepting

@ job that bas a future, Although he could be retained on LIPSTICK as an
agent on a full-time basis, this-vould not satisfy his ambition for. secure
employment with a future. It is therefore requested that Headquarters

write a contract for LIPSTICE-20 similar to that of David M, WILSTED's -
present contract at the equivalent salary of a GS-7 with the usual overtine .
Provision that is included in WILSTED's contract, In order to provide for “

that this Mission te authorized by cable to Place the subject on a wv
full-tine salary tnets. under the LIPSTICK project at 2,000 Noxicas pesos

Per month or $160,00 U.S, :

4. | Generally. ths following duties are contemplated for LIPSTICK-20 for

full tine employmnt; (1) he will be given credentials in a local police

service, and togsthar with LIPSTICK-19 and others, msintain the investi-

gativo office of the LIPSTICK teams (2)-he will be able to backstop the

team with these crodontials and engage in investigative work to solve the

many loads that tho surveiitances produce; (3) ho will prepare rouah

reports based upon the LIPSTICK surveillances; (4) he will provide a tele-

Phone central part of tho day to which the LIPSTICK team will be able to

5. As an assistance to Headquarters in the granting. of contract status : :
to LIPSTICK-20, there is being forwarded by separate cover a revised” PRQ,

Pert I, which was completed. by LIPSTICK-20, This PRQ is considerably more
complete than the initial PRQ vhich was submitted to Headquarters based

upon inforzation gathered froa ACID files and friends of the subject,

The Case Officer vas in receipt of erroneous information regarding the

@nswers to Questions 10 and 28 wherein reference is nade to the fanily

dairy business. Th PRQ submitted as & separate cover attachment to E oe
this dispatch correctly reflects the correct answers to those questions, E

6. It 4s realized that Reference B does not @pply to individuals in

the Subject's position since he is not a eitizen of FBPRIE,. Howover,
this individual does satisfy the other requirements of Reference B, i.e.
Jangunge ability, aroa knovledge and natural cover potential, It ie
believed that, if civan a contract, LIPSTICK-20 wil? be willing. to work
on @ career basis for KUBARK and vill f112 a very great need of this |
Mission. Indigenous agents of his education, social status, intelligence
and ability are not froquently to be found. ‘Therefore his addition to the
staff of the Mission as a contract agent is recommended. 2
