contimity of emyloyment. between the time that the subject graduates

fron college and the time that his contract is ready, it is requested

that this Mission be authorized by cable to place the subject on a :

full-time salary tils under the LIPSTICK project at 2,000 Mexican pesoa

per month or $160.00 U.s.

Generally the following duties are cantomplated for LIPSTICK-20 for

full tino employmnt: (1) ho u1ll be given credentials in a local police

service, and togither with LIPSTICK-19 and others, maintain the inveatl

gatiro office of the LIPSTICK team, (2) he will be able to backstop the

team with these credontials and engage in investigative work to solve the

many leads that the surveillances produco; (3) he will prepare rough

reports based upon the LIPSTICK surveillances; (4) he will provide a tole

phone central part of the day to which the LIPSTICK team will be able to

report their positim in code; (5) ho may, at some future dato, be used aa

• LIPE:T translator since he is completely bilingual; and (6) he nay, at

some future date, bo used on other operational duties in a siniler manner

as other contract agents are employed nt this Misaion but only after he

has proven hinself and Headquarters concurrence has been obtained.

5.

As an assistanco to Headquarters in the granting of contract statua

to LIPSIICK-20, there is being forwarded by separate cover a revised PRQ,

Part I, :hich was completed by LIPSTICK-20.

This PRQ 18 coralderably more

complete than the initial PRQ which was submitted to Headquarters based

upon information gatherod fron WACID files and friends of the subject.

The Case Officer was in receipt of erroneous infomation regarding the

ansvers to Questiona 10 and 28 wherein referenco is nade to the family

dairy business.

The PRQ submitted as a separate cover attachment to

this dispatch correctly reflecta the correct answers to those questions,

6.

It is realized that Reference B does not apply to indiriduals in

the Subject's position since he is not a citisen of PBPRDE.: However,

this Individual does satisfy the other requirements of leference B, 1.0.,

language ability, area knowledge and natural cover potential.. It 1B

believed that, 1f liven a contract, LIPSTICR-20 wil: be willing to work

on a career basis for KUBARK and will f1ll a very great need of this

Mission®

Indigenous agents of his education, social status, Intelligence

and ability are not frequently to be found.

Therefore his addition to the

staff of the Mission as a contract agent is recoumended.
