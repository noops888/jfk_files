them he wished to join this

committee. During the latter

part of May of this year he recelvid a membership card in

this organization which bore a date of May 28, 1963, and

was made out in the name of LEE H. OSWALD and was signed

He described this card as being gray in

was signed by A. d. hidell, and it pore in the lower

right hand correr the Wunber 33 which he said indicated

cards and exhibited both of them.

Since becoming a member of the national

committee, OSWALD said that he has been receiving the

monthly circular of the committee which is about seven

pages in length. He claimed that he could not recall

the name of this publication.

Since receiving his membersbip card in the

New Orleans chapter of the committee he said that he had

spoken with alDeLL on the telephone on several occasions.

On these occasions, HIDELL would discuss general matters

of mutual interest

in connection with committee business,

and on other occasions he would inform him of a scheduled

OSWALD admitted that on one occasion

Last Wednesday, August 7,

1963, OSWALD said

he received a note through the mail from

HIDELL.

The

note asked him if he had time would he mind distributing

some Fair Play literature in the downtown area of

New Orleans.

He said HIDELL knew that he was not working

and probably had time.

HIDELL also knew that he had

considerable literature on the committce which had been

furnished to him by the national committee in New York.

Since he did not have anything to do, OSWALD said he

decided he would go down to Canal Street and distribute

some literature. He denied that he was being paid for

his services, but that he was doing it as a patriotic

duty •

About one p.l. on August 9, 1963, OSWALD said

that he went down on Canal Street by himself and started

distributing committee literature. He said be had made

up a placard which he hung around his neck with a piece

stringica pracare va

The placard was made up of brown cardboard.

On the placard were several pieces of literature which

expressed the aims and purposes of the committee. At'

the bottom of the cardboard placard he said he had printed

in black capital letters the words "Viva FIDEL." From

this time until around four p.m. he said he distributed

a throwaway which was prepared on yellow paper, 6" & 9"

These

individuals became very angry, tore up the throwaways,

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960,

edition of "The New York

Times" newspaper contained a full-oage advertisement

captioned "What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed

by the Fair Play For Cuba Committee (FPCC) .

advertisement announced the formation of the FPCC in

New York City and declared the FPCC intended to pro-

mulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize

the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11,

1961, reported that at a hearing conducted before the

United Statos Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on

January 10, 1961, Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified

himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC.

also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the Cuban

Government which were applied toward the cost of the afore-

mentioned advertisement.

"On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during

the first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a

struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist

Workers Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within

the FPCC and thereby influence FPCC policy.

however

during the past year this source observed there has beer

a successful effort by FPCC leadership to minimize the

role of these and other organizations in the FPCC so

that today their influence is negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

the National Headquarters

of the FPCC is located in

Room 329 at 799 Broadway, New York City:

According to

this source, the position of National Office Director

was created in the fall of 1962 and was filled by VINCENT

"TED" LEE, who now formulates FPCC policy. This source

observed LEE has followed a course of entertaining and

accepting the cooperation of many other organizations

including the CP and the SWP when he has felt it would

ever, LEE has indicated to this source he has no lutention

of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other

organization.

LEE feels the FPCC should advocate

resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the

United States and support the right of Cubans to manage

their revolution without interference from other nations,

but not support the Cuban revolution per se.

The CP and the SWP have been designated pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.

CORLISS LAMONT

On September 28, 1963, LOUIS F. BUDENZ testified

before the United States Senate Permanent Investigations

Subcommittee that EARL BROWDER, as head of the Communist

Party (CP) in the United States, had referred to CORLISS

LAMONT as one of the "four prides" of the CP because

CORLISS LAMONT was ready to cooperate with any Communist

front or any Communist cause BROWDER made this reference

at a National Committee meeting of the CP in the garly

1940's. BUDENZ also recalled that LAMONT was a member of

the CP when he, BUDENZ, was a member.
