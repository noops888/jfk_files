b. This is an earnest of the

desire of moderate Baathist

leaders

in Damascus to preserve workable re

lations with Iraq, partly as a

counterbalance to Cairo and partly

to preserve what remains of Baathist

influence in Baghdad.

3.

Turkey

a. Prime Minister Inonu's

coalition government is about to

collapse.

It has long been shaky.

Last week it was dealt a severe set-

back

when the opposition Justice

Party, heir of the Menderes regime,

emerged from local elections as the

country's majority party.

c.

Now the Peasant Party, one

of the

three in the coalition,

has

voted to pull out, and probably will

do so as soon as Inonu gets back from

Washington. Another partner, the

Turkey Party. has wanted to pull out|

A new coalition is at least

a theoretical possibility, with a

number of independents taking the

place of the Peasant Party, but

Inonu probably would not be prime

minister.

e. The military are working

for an all-party coalition. This

way, they feel, they could keep

tabs on the Justice Party, but the

Justice Party is not likely to buy

this arrangement.

1.

As matters now stand, the

military would take over the govern

ment itself before it would let the

Justice Party form one.

USSR wheat

a.

]the decision to buy wheat abroad

was taken to avoid lowering reserves,

which he has described as ample for

one or two years. We think the sit-

uation is more serious than that.

(Cont 'd)

b. This year's harvest was

clearly very bad.

The weight of

evidence suggests that Soviet grain

stockpiles have been far drawn down

this year and are not sufficient to

protect the country from another

poor harvest.

c. Our estimate is that total

grain production each year since

1958 has been well below that year's

level of 125 million tons, while

the population has continued to grow.

d. We have seen

signs

of extensive slaughtering in

anticipation of fodder shortages

during the winter.

This runs counter

to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to

build up the livestock industry.

e. We have also noted that

the extensive wheat purchases weaken

the USSR's gold reserves at a time

when it hopes to expand its imports

of machinery for a huge chemical

fertilizer program.

In addition, we have seen

signs of stringent measures to pro-

tect the grain supply, accompanied

oy public discontent in some areas

over the absence of bread.

Peiping last week con-

cracted for some 300,000 tons 01

Argentina.

b. This adds to the 1,000,000

tons just contracted for with Aus-

but is still far below

the 5,000,000 tons the Chinese have

normally imported in recent years.

Additional suppliers will be hard

to find.

Czechoslovakia-

USSR

a. Czech President and party

boss Novotny has gone to Moscow,

evidently for economic talks, judg-

Ing by the composition of his dele

gation.

b.

Novotny's background of

Stalinist excesses have put him on

the wrong side of Khrushchev.

They

also have given rise to control

problems, particularly in the frac-

tious Slovak party where pressures

for liberalization have made their

mark.

C.

Party problems and Novotny's

leadership may thus also come under

review.

d. A curious sign of the times

is the fact that, although president

Novotny is in Moscow,

the presidential

flag has remained up

at the official

residence. It might simply have been

an oversight, but the symbolism wil

not be lost to the people in prague.

7.

Cambodia

Cambodia, as expected, has

asked the Geneva

co-chairman to call

the Geneva conference participants

together (in Djakarta) to discuss

measures "to ensure the internation-

ally

guaranteed and controlled neu-

tralization of Cambodia."

b.

Last year when this

came

up, the French were inclined

to go

along with some such idea.

They have indicated to us

that they still feel Sihanouk should

not be turned down, and Sihanouk is

obviously hopeful that they will

exert pressure on us and the British.

d.

Sihanouk seems to be hoping

for at least a rump session attended

by conferees who are willing to do

his bidding.

d. Adoula's government already

subversives, which now numbers about

50, is being helped by the Communist

e.

It operates fairly freely

in the

loose circumstances which now

obtain in Brazzaville. . Its activities

may soon become a serious source of

friction between the two countries.

NOTES

South Korea

With 85 percent of the vote in, Pak

Chong-hui's Democratic Republican Party has already

won an absolute majority in the National Assembly

elections held yesterday.

Venezuela

The country's three major presidential

candidates were the targets of unsuccessful assassi

nation attempts yesterday as Communist led terror

ists moved into the

final week of desperate attempt

to wreck next Sunday's elections. A US Embassy of-

ficial was also the intended recipient of a "Christ-

mas package" containing a bomb. Yesterday a US

rubber warehouse was set afire and destroyed by

terrorists.

Indonesia-Philippines

Indonesia-Malaysia

Indonesian-inspired press re-

ports yesterday claimed a British military plane

was shot down near the North Borneo border.

G.

Cambodia is cutting its diplomatic rep-

resentation abroad to a bare minimum as an austerity

measure following curtailment of Us aid.

Sihanouk

announced last week that this would be done, saying

that missions in Communist countries would not be

affected since those countries "protect" Cambodia.

Curiously enough, among the missions being closed

down are those in New Delhi and Bangoon.

USSR-US

Pravda this morning reports on Gromyko's

Ealks with President Johnson, giving top play to

Senator Fulbright's remarks about the desirability

of a meeting between the President and Khrushchev.
