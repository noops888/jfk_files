SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Mr. Kenneth Brooten, Former
Assistant Counsel, House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA)

1, On 11 May 1977, the Office of Legislative Counsel received a
telephone call from the office of Representative Henry Gonzalez
(D., Texas) asking that this office contact Mr. Brooten, who is now
practicing law in Florida. It was stated that he had information of
interest about the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The
undersigned responded to this request but was umable to reach Mr.
Brooten until this date, since he was out of town.

2. I reached Mr. Brooten in his office in Florida and identified
myself to him as representing the Office of Legislative Counsel of the
CIA. I reminded him of the last time we had met in December 1976 when he

meeting. Mr. Brooten stated that he had been receiving "dribbles of

Counsel of the HSCA, When I learned the intent of his call, I asked

He agreed to this.

“hired most of the people on that staff except me." I responded that
the HSCA was George Cary's and my account and that I knew nothing about

leave the impression with him that we would not be contacting him further

on this matter.
