MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
| + SUBJECT: . Statement Prepared by AELADLE

‘The following statement vas dictated by AELADLE on 27 December
1961. Due to technical difficulties, the transcription of his
statement is incomplete. :

. "As it is known to you, my decision to go over to the

West was made by me practically since back in 1955. -There-
' fore, ince that time I have studied the entire activity

of @il the Soviet (intelligence) organs, life in the Soviet
+i Union from thia standpoint or from thie angle: I try to

think of hov, in the future, when I vould go over to the West,

, bow I cculd help the West in the organizing of the cold war

Qgainst the Soviet Union, against the regime that exists in
the Soviet Union and the other countries behind the Iron
Curtain. Therefore all these questions vere thought cut by me
very carefully in @ historical plane, a political plane, an
intelligence plane, and a counterintelligence plane. Now
‘that this etep has already been taken by me, I have been ex-
Pecting that your important people, people of authority in
your authoritative organizations, the most authoritative in
iS the country, will give du consideration to ay proposale and

myself. T have been expecting that right from the beginning

‘thie whole thing will be considered political haste. The
leaders of your country, after they becove convinced that I
* Made thie step on the basis of most sincere convictions and

Fe

Concerning Finland,--I thovght that after that it will be
. Of great interest to leaders of your country to hear me out

On the basic questions concerning thingi that are taking
«Place in the Soviet Union, on questions which represent the

threat to the Western countries from the Soviet Union 2ad
otter countries behing the Irun Curtain. On these subjects
which I peraonaily may be of help in the future, I thought
> that this case would be of wreat interest to the President. 1

,this I have proven by, for example, by giving all the information

invent,

that the most serious attention will be given to this
whole affair. I thought that right after the step that I took, i 7
thay vould hold a aeeting of the National Security Council, H
during vhieh I vould be able to report to the members of this i .
Council on all the political and other activities. I expected Hae
that I vould be given the possibility of appearing before se
Rational Security Council, and to repors to the organ which is
concerned with the security of the U. S. A., what is being done
along the line of intelligence, at least of intelligence egainst H
the United States ani other democragic countries, in order that i
the people responsible for the security of the United States
would at last understand vhat a great danger the Soviet Unicu
represents; the great danger that the Soviet Union represents
to the United States and to the West as a whole because I ox
certain, that vba. I knov, vhat I could report is of great
interest as far es the organization, the measures that have to
De token and the struggle agsinst this danger are concerned.
,, Secondly, I thought that my defection to the West, my plans
.’ concerning ay help to the West in organizing a struggle agains’
the Soviet system, against Soviet Intelligence, against the
Boviet Police, vould be of great interest to other denocratic
countries such as England, France, West Germany and Others. T
“"ghought that the President would find it possible to invite
for ® short counsel, the heads of governments-of other demo-
cratic countries, so tint I-vould also be able to report to all.
| of them on what is being done by the Soviet Union against these
countries, as vell as against the West aa a whcle, because I
know that on the basis of my report, it would be possible to
take more effective and important counter-messure;
