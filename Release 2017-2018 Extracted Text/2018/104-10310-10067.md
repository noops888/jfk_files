SUBJECT : Oswald Flight Inquiry by Time Magazine Ly
j f

Hayes Gorey of Time is writing a piece on Oswald. Ls
He finds in the Warren Commission report a letter
from Helms to Rep. Rankin. . It is exhibit 2274. The letter Ue

says there were no October 10 flights from London to Helsinki
but that the Agency will dig still further to clarify this

point. tick

This has to do with the passage of Oswald from London a)
to the Soviet Union, I gather.

Mr. Gorey's query is: a
Was the digging done? What did it show?

Is there anything we can do to help Mr. Gorey.

SUBJECT _. : Oswald Flight Inquery by Time Magazine

Pursuant to Mr. Thuermer's request to provide

Mr. Gorey of Time magazine information on Agency efforts
clarifying whether or not there was an October 10, 1959
flight from London to Helsinki, Agency records indicate
a message was received dated 24 June 1964 which reflected
that there was a direct flight from London to Helsinki
on 10 October 1959. It was FINNAIR Flight 852 which
arrived Helsinki at 2333 hours. This information was
passed on July 1, 1964 to Representative Rankin. Efforts
to ascertain if there. were other more circuitous flights
from London on that date were explored without apparent

success.
