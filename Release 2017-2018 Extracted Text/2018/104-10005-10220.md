MEMORANDUM TO:

Mr. Rocca, Chief, CI/R&A

SUBJECT

Lee Harvey Oswald - Review of controversial data on

201-289,248

dissident Cubans scheduled to be

Commission. Our mission was to examine some FBI reports, called to

our attention by Dr. Goldberg, containing references to persons in

Cuba.. The reports were unclassified and destined shortly for public

release with most of the other Oswald case exhibits.

According to

Dr. Goldberg, some of the remarks made about the Cubans reflected

disloyalty on their part toward the Castro regime and probably would

hurt them when the evidence became public. We examined about two

dozen folders containing FBI reports. Most of the information was

developed by the FBI in the Miami area when interviewing Cuban refugees

relative to the Oswald case.

The WH representatives concurred with Dr. Goldberg's view and

recommended that all controversal data be deleted. During the inspection,

they recognized the names of several individuals now in Cuba who undoubt-

edly would suffer as a result of the unsolicited publicity.

Dr. Goldberg

said that he would delete all of the offensive itens and thanked us for

our cooperation. He said that he also had invited the FBI to look over

the material and was expecting a similar review by that agency. In any

event, Dr. Goldberg said he would exercise his own official prerogative

and abide by our wishes.
