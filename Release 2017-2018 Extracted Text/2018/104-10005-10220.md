diss

wblisheol by Warren Commission
On 3 November 1964, I took’ Sam Halpern, oat Trettin,
land Nester Senchez of the Cuban desk (WH/SA) to the Warren

ssion. Our mission was to examine some FBI reports, called to
our attention by Dr. Goldberg, containing references to persons in
Cuba. The reports were unclassified and destined shortly for public
release with most of the other Oswald case exhibits. According to
Dr. Goldberg, some of the remarks made about the Cubans reflected
disloyalty on their part toward the Castro regime and probably would
hurt them when the evidence became public. We examined about two
dozen folders containing FBI reports. Most of the information was
developed by the FBI in the Miami area when interviewing Cuban refugees
relative to the Oswald case.

\

The WH representatives concurred with Dr. Goldberg's view and
recommended that all controversal data be deleted. During the inspection,
they recognized the names of several individuals now in Cuba who undoubt-

id edly would suffer as a result of the umsolicited publicity. Dr. Goldberg

\" said that he would delete all of the offensive items and thanked us for
our cooperation. He said that he also had invited the FBI to look over
the material and was expecting a similar review by that agency. In any
event, Dr. Goldberg seid he would exercise his owm official prerogative
and abide by our wishes.
