RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

' INCOME TAXES

A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal income tax on

monies received from the Bureau without jeopardizing their security. This plan

will go into effect immediately in the San Francisco and Philadelphia Offices for

a trial period of one year. Payments for services to certain security informants

and sources will be subject to a twenty per cent withholding tax. No tax is to be

withheld from payments made (1) to other than security informants and sources,

(2) for reimbursement of expenses, (3) under the authority of the SAC or (4) to

informants who have been able to report Bureau income on their Federal tax

returns without jeopardizing their security or without challenge from IRS. In

the latter instance, the Bureau must be advised as to the identity of each

informant and the method used by him to report his Bureau income.

Proper records must be maintained of amounts withheld and such

amounts must be placed in a special checking account. "At the end of the tax

year, the tax liability will be determined on money paid by the Bureau to those

informants from whom tax has been withheld. Necessary adjustments will be

worked out with the informants and the net amount withheld forwarded to the

Bureau.

This money will be turned over to a special representative of IRS

without disclosure as to identities of informants, except for coded numbers.

These numbers can later be used for identification purposes in the event it

becomes necessary to substantiate income tax payments.

Other offices may now utilize the withholding system where it

would be helpful; however, where it is not used, continue to instruct all informants

to pay their taxes on income received from the Bureau by such method as may

be proper and feasible.

Detailed instructions and exhibits are enclosed concerning the

procedure to be followed in the accounting and control of money withheld.

WITHHOLDING OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX

FROM PAYMENTS TO INFORMANTS AND SOURCES

INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEDURES

Introduction:

A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service

(IRS) which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal

income tax on monies received from the Bureau without jeopardizing

their security. This will require the withholding of twenty per cent

of any payments being made to such individuals for services rendered.

Money so withheld will be immediately deposited to a special checking

account, to be used for this purpose only, set up in the name of the

SAC and ASAC. This account should, ir possible, be in a different bank

than that in which the regular office Confidential Fund (blue slip) or

Double Agent (white slip) accounts are maintained. Any bank charges

incidental, to this special checking account are to be paid from the

regular office Confidential Fund. •Attached to these instructions are

10 Exhibits which are to be used as guides in setting up records for

the maintenance and operations of the withholding accounts. Hereafter,

any teference to informants refers to both informants and sources.

This plan will apply only to those informants or groups of

informants authorized by the Bureau.

Accounting Instructions:

When a payment is to be made to an informant subject to this

plan, the amount to be withheld for income tax purposes will be

twenty per cent of the total for services. A check will' be drawn on

the regular office Confidential Fund to cover the total amount of the

authorized payment.

This check will be cashed and the amount for taxes

Immediately deposited in the special checking account set up for this

purpose.

A duplicate deposit slip is to be obtained for use in posting

to the ledger accounts. Payment to the informant will then follow and

the receipt to be executed by the informant for such payment should show

not only the amount received as reimbursement for expenses and the

authorized payment for services, but also the amount withheld for

Enclosures (10)

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 35

## Page 36

Federal income tax purposes (Exhibit 1). A Record of Income Tax

Transactions (Exhibits 2 'and 3) will be maintained on a calendar-year

basis to record the informant's name, symbol number, period covered,

and the amounts'incidental to such transactions. Beginning with the

first payment to an informant involving tax withholding, a new

indiVidual ledger sheet (Exhibits 4 and 5) must be set up. The amount

of money withheld for income tax purposes should also be listed on

the Blue Slip, Form FD 37, prepared with respect to the payment

(Exhibit 6).

At the end of each month, entries in the Record of Income Tax

Transactions and the individual informant's ledgers will be totaled

and reconciled. A monthly report (Exhibit 7) is to be mailed to the

Bureau in the same manner as the reports for the regular office

Confidential Fund, no later than the 20th of the following month. All

payments involving the tax account must be vouchered prior to the

submission of this report.

In the event an informant subject to this plan is transferred

to another field division, all records must be forwarded to the new

field division, together with a check for the amount of income tax

withheld.

Determining Informant's Tax Obligation:

At the end of the tax year, the contacting Agent will obtain

from the informant his compieted Federal income tax return based on his

regular income, exclusive of money paid to him by the Bureau. The

contacting Agent will not question the accuracy of the return except to

point out obvious errors. The contacting Agent will furnish the

informant's tax return to a qualified Special Agent Accountant who will

prepare a separate return to include Bureau income. The accountant will

compute the tax owed by informant on the combined earnings. The

difference between the tax computed by the informant and that computed

by the accountant will represent the amount of tax to be paid by the

informant on money received from the Bureau. The accountant who

prepared the return will sign on the line "Signature of Preparer Other

Than the Taxpayer." The contacting Agent will have the informant sign

the return prepared by the accountant as a certification that the

informant has reviewed it and found it correct in every respect. The

informant will file his original tax return with the Internal Revenue .

Service (IRS). The return

prepared by the accountant, together with a

Photostat of the informant's original return, will be maintained in the

informant's subfile.

## Page 37

If the amount withheld from payments to the informant during

the year exceeds the amount of tax for his Bureau income, the refund

due the informant will be withdrawn from the special checking account

and paid to him at the time he signs the return prepared by the

accountant. A receipt (Exhibit 8) must be obtained from him. If the

amount withheld during the year is not sufficient to cover the tax on

Bureau income, the difference should be collected from the informant

and a statement (Exhibit 9)

obtained from him. Entries for any

adjustments, either refunds or additional payments, must be made in

both the informant's ledger (Exhibits 4 and 5) and the Record of

Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) for the calendar year involved.

Instructions to Informants:

The contacting Agent must, fully explain the withholding

procedure to any informant concerned. With regard to the informant's

original tax return, the informant should clearly understand that

(1) neither the contacting Agent nor the Special Agent Accountant is

In any way certifying to its accuracy, (2) if his original tax return

Is questioned by IPS, it will be up to him to settle the matter with

IRs, and he cannot plead that it has been examined and approved by an

Agent of the FBI, since such"

statement'is false and the informant would

be uncovered.

Iransmittal of Tax to Bureau:

After all adjustments have been made in the income tax

withholding or payments to informants, a report of Federal Income Tax

Deductions (Exhibit 10) will be prepared. The net amount of the tax

indicated on the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) will

be withdrawn from the special checking account by means of a check made

payable to the Chief Clerk, FBI. This report and check will be forwarded

to the Bureau, together with receipts for refunds that have been made

showing the transmittal of the tax funds to the Bureau should be made in

the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2). When received at

the Bureau, the tax money will be turned over to a special representative

of IRs with the amounts 'for each informant identified by a coded number;.

thus, the informant's connection with the FBI will be protected.

However, the coded number can be used for identification purposes in

the event it becomes necessary to substantiate the informant's income tax

payment.

WASHINGTON, D.G. 20535

Its Reply, Please Refer 10

File No.

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

- INCOME TAXES

No Number SAC Letter 64-E dated July 6, 1964, advised that

effective January 1, 1965, all field divisions must utilize the Bureau

Federal income tax withholding plan for payments to security informants

and sources. In order to place the plan in effect, you were to discuss

the matter with each informant and source where circumstances warranted

using the procedure and advise the Bureau by November 1, 1964, of the

identity of each exempted informant and the, method used by each such

individual in reporting his Bureau income.

Communications being received from the field indicate that

the plan is being utilized for many informants but, at the same time,

there are a great many instances where the informant has not had any

difficulty in reporting his Bureau income in the past-and, therefore,

these informants are being exempted by the field from the withholding

plan. The procedure was devised by the Bureau to afford informants

a method of reporting Bureau income in a secure manner and should

be utilized wherever necessary to prevent any embarrassing situations

in the future such as those which occur when an informant finds it

necessary to disclose his receipt of income from the FBI in response

to inquiries from Internal Revenue Service or it is later found that

taxes have not been paid on Bureau income. There should be no further

instances of this type and you are reminded that if situations do arise

in the future where it is learned informants are not reporting Bureau

income and they have not used the withholding procedure, administrative

action will be considered by the Bureau in each such case.

CRIMINAL INFORMANIS

1084 - D

DO DETININION

Aù individual who furnishes valuable information within oni criminal

investigative jurisdiction or concerning other criminal matters of

interest to the Bureau

ILLUSTRATION

This type informant includes members of the underworlds those who closely

associate

with criminals or have intimate krowledge of

criminal activities.

typical examples o1 such persons are madams, prostitutes, pimps, fences,

сод me, hijackers, robbers, burglars, hoodlums, gangsters, and tause

individuals wio associate with or have knowledge of such persons.

. I

The listing of an individual as an approved Bureau informant is dependent

upon whether le or

she can regularly furnish valuable criminal information.

In most instances

an individual will be approted who has:

Furnished worth-while information in two or more Bureau cases

Furnished worth-while information in one Bureau case and better than

average informationirelating to criminal intelligence investigations ]

Furnished worth wbile information in at least one Bureau case and in

one other state or local case which is acted upon by the responsible

authorities so as to obtain corroboration of the. informant's report

Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in

one other federal case which

is acted upon by

the interested Federal

agenoy, so as to obtain corroboration of the informant's report

DO DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

One of the most important resporsibilities of an Agent is the identi-

fication of prospective

criminal informants and the developnent of pros

pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute

information to the Bureau.

20

Criminal informants are used to:

juvai lugiüires duu reinesses

Report cases we would not otherwise receive

Report plans to commit offenses

Advise of general criminal activities

30

Informants are developed from those who volunteer to be of assistanca;

from subjects in cases investigated; from persons interviewed during

investigations; and from selected prospects who are clearly in a posi-

to obtain worth-while information.

Their development frezuently

requires patient, protracted effort to find a basis for persuading

them to cooperate in furnishing imornation.

40

attempting to persuade individuals to act as

informants to avoid any allegations of unaue influence. An individual

who is in custody and who offers to furnish information generally does

so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in return.

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity or any reduction in sentence

to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves

in a position where they migut subsequently be accused of having done so.

5.

Once an individual has started to cooperate and furnishes information

his continued cooperation can frequently be assured through

be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to

DEPARIMENT POLICY AND OPINION

has issued instructions to tell all USAs that informants of

the Bureau shall not be intervierea os subpoenaed without prior consent of te

Department.

Any deviation from this policy should be immediately brought to

the Bureau's attention.

On 7-10-52 the Department furnished an opinion regarding the question wether

an informant could be prosecuted for technically violating the law while

attempting to obtain evidence regarding a Federal violation.

The Department

"...If the intent throughout was

to assist the government agonts in

the enjorcement of the law, and not to violate or to cover-up, for a vio

the law, it is not believed a case for prosecution could be made

against such an informer...."

"The procedures to be followed by informers working under the supertision

of your agents in the aid of

enforoing the statutes coming within your jurisdic-

tion largely rests upon your sound discretion....It is not believed that an

informer would be otherwise immune from prosecution for actions which would

subject a Federal enforcement officer

TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM

1.

The top echelon criminal informant

program is aimed

specifically at developing

informants who can provide a continuous flow of quality criminal intelli-

gence information regarding

the leaders of organized criminal activity

throughout the nation.

It is directed at developing informants in the

following categories:

Informants who are

members of La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

Informants who can furnish significant information regarding other

organized criminal groups

Informants at the top level

of organized gambling activity who can

provide information that will enable the Bureau to effectively

..

enforce the anti-gambling statutes

Paêuamanus who can produce accurate and authentic date regarding the

extent of

graft and corruption in each sector of the nation

Informants who can furnish information which will enable the Bureau

to prosecute the hoodlum hierarchy

2.

The development of informants who can provide information of this caliber

is mandatory to insure the Bureau meets its commitments.

This program calls for the selection of

Dear Sir:

It has been noted in connection with confidential

disburserents being made by special agents for which reim

bursement is claired by blue slip that in many instances the

receipt is executed in the name of an agent or person other

than the agent claiming reirbursement.

It is desired that whenever possible the receipt

be made in the name of the agent who pays the bill and who

will claim reimbursement. It is understood. that in all

instances this will noù se practical, for instance, if Agent

Smith makes arrangemerts for the rental of an apartrent for

surveillance purposes and he is later transferred from this

assignment the bill ordinarily will be continued in his name and

paid by another agent. In instances such as this the agent

who pays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per-

•sonally paia

same and that he is claiming reimburserent there-

for. If the receipt is made out in the aame of an alias

boing used by the agent thảs lust should ba amplaineà in the

blue slip.

In those instances waere, payment is made to an

intormant Ior services rendered over a definite period the

date of the beginning and ending of the period shound be

indicated on the blue slir.

This matter should be brought to the attention oi

all special agents under your supervision and the blue slios

sibmitted should be carefully checked by you to see that they

conform irith the above instructions. Close attention to this

matter irill obviate the necessity for returning expense accounts

for correction.

Very truly yours,

The Bureau has noted an increasing trend on the part of Special

Aguido in Guigo of angioving concidencial expenaliures which say au some

time be subject to question.

The Sureau refers Darticularly to those ex-

penditures made by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential informants.

It has been necessary for the. Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

imburse certain Agents for expenditures made when it appeared that the ex-

penditures rade were out of line in so far as necessity for the securing.

of the information ras concerned.

The Bureau has further noted a tendency

growing up in the field for Special Agents in Charge to approve confidential

expenditures for 10$ and 15% and other very minor anounts which probably

should be subject io further scrutiny by the Special Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenditures but must insist that each Special Agent in Charge personally

review and approve such expenditures as are made by employees under his

jurisdiction.

It is understood that with the type of internal security

work presently being performed by a great many Special Agents, certain

necessary. experditures must be made in connection with physical surveil-

lances and lika matters; horever, it shouid be understood that a Special

Agent, in so far as food and entertainment are concerned, is under certain

The Bureau will continue its present policy of returning to any

Agent without reimbursesent any confidential expenditure which does not ap-

pear to be fully and thoroughly justified. The Bureau must, of course, in-

sist on each Special agent in Charge making it his personal responsibility:

without delegation to other subordinate employees the review of confidential

expenditures: to definitely ascertain that the expenditure has been proger

and that the expenditure of the funds in question has been of material bena-

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present tise

.of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential

fund and the submission of monunly reports in connection theremin.

You are anare, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the

confidential fund in each field office, including therein its status

with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursemenus which

have been made during the current accounting period. .

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-

mit such sonthly staterents promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to othermise maintain an accurate

record upon the casis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent

in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection,

a review of blue slip itens received at

the Bureau over a period of time reflects an increasing number of pay-

ments in the nature

of so-called "advances" to confidential infore-

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companics

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10

to $20.

At the time the monthly statement is submitted by the field

office involved, such statements invariably fail to indicate that the

expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances.they

are inproperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 61

---

## Page 62

-2.

an accurate accouning on the part of the bureau

In

respect thereto.

For. your guidance in the preparation of future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly

the manner in mich disoursements, advances, refunds, or purchases

are to be listed. All subsequent

monthly statements

prepared by

your office should de submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Special Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the

expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue

slips.

For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-

odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of

a money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-

ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren-

dared by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

of rooms, and the obiaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of

a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the bureau is necessarily aware of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that

such receipts be obtained for

confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise

practicable to do so. Hereafter, confidential items will be sus-

pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beading, clothing, and

related luems utilizes in the conduce or various plants and other

confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the

field office inventories.

Accordingly, it is

desired that you forward to the Burcau in the near future a detailed

report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased

and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the Bureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by each of the respective field offices

having control, custody, or possession of such equipment.

With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate nor-expendable receiving slips.

Such slips should indi-

cate that the iten was purchased through the submission of blue

slips.

The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips subnitted

and

suspensions from the youchars will be made in those instances

where field offices lail to submit non-expendable receiving slips.

Accordingly,

desired that the non-exper

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein

your immediate personal attention and supervision: It is expected

that

in the future there will be strict compliance with the foré-

going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

cies

may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

that such ex-

confidential expenditure made by any Special Agent of the Bureau unless such

an expenditure was made for the purpose of securing information relating to

matters under the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau, it not being pos-

sible to secure such information in any other manner.

In making such expenditures, all Special Agents must bear in mind

that rapagment can bo mado only in dhi cruno do i vificänius vun Do mado vinci

• the payment for such confidential information was made in the interest of che

Government Service, and that the amount paid represented expenditures incurrea

in making confidential investigations.of alleged plots or conspiracies against

the United States Goverrment or for the purpose of securing confidential in-

formation pertaining to violations of the Federal Statutes which could not

otherwise have been secured. The information contained on the confidential

item subaitted by tre Agent in question should be such that it will be readily

ascertainable at the Bureau that such expenditure was essential and necessary:

when Bureau authority nas been granted for an experditure

of this nasure, the field office is required to give suon authorization on the

confidential item submitted to reclaim the expenditure.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expendituree.

In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the administrative Division, it is noted that in rany instances there

on looking the thes

will be no recora of the expenditure having been euthorized. .

In the future when authorization is granted for expenditures of this

nature, the Administrative Division must be advised.

In the field office is

granted authority by letter, a copy of the letter must be made for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517.

If authority is granted telephonically, it will be necessary

that the official or supervisor granting the authority notify the Aîministrative

Division by enorandim, giving the name of the verson to whom payment is authorizea

ana the field oifice involved.

The above instructions are to be placed into effect immediately in order

to preclude ihe delay which is now being experienced. in determining whether the

SAC LETTER

RE: ACTIVITIES OF THE

CONFIDENTIAL FUND

The Bureau is desirous at

the present time of bringing to your attention

the absolute necessity for the careful handling of expenditures from the Con-

You are aware that under existing Bureau regulations it is absolutely

essential that an appropriate statement pe submitted at the end of each conth

reflecting the condition oi the Confidential Fund in each field office, including

therein its status with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements

which have been rade during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to submit such

montaig steterents promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly

difficult to properly audit the Bureau's recoras in connection therewith. As

set out in SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, all Confidential Furd rerorts

should be received at the Bureau no later than the 20th of the following month.

• For your guidance in the preparation of future monthly reporis concern-

Ing Confidential Fund expenditures: there is enclosed a sample form which outlines

briefly the proper method of preparing the report. In addition, there is enclosed

a sample form which outlines the method which should be used to

summarize the

payments to inforrents and confidential sources. In this regard your attention

15 directed to Section (A), SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, which is

reTised In that the Atomic

Energy informants should be deleted from the report.

The surmary should now reflect payments to Criminal and National Defense

Confidential Sources.

It has

noted that in a great numbei

instances Special Agents

have not been sucmitting receipts to justify the

experditwes for which re-

Imbursements are being claired through blue slips.

The Bureau is awere of the

fact that receipts cannot be secwed in each and every irstance, aue to

exigencies peculiar to certain types of activities, nevertheless, receipts

should be obtained wherever possible.

In connection with the preparation of the blue slips it has been

noted that some are being preyered too much in detail. In those instances where

the payrent is made to an authorized reguler paid infomant, the following

Infornation is sufficient to support the claim:

I. Amount of payrent

2.

Name and symbol, number of informant

3. Case

4. Date of authorization letter or teletype

5. Period of payment

A sample foru reflecting the proper method for preparing a blue slip

1s attached,

The Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re-

claiming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the toucher that the item was

suspended fron a previous voucher. It is pointed out that no reference should

Do made to the previous voucher nos should the igent state that the item was

suspended unless he forwards the original Stetement of Difference with the

voucher.

Iour attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a

limited amount of lunds available to operate the Confidential Funds of the

Ilela divisions, therefore, you should rake every effort to operate on your

present fund.

It is pointed out that a more frequent submission of Confidential

Fund vouchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the funa.

In the future when an office desires to establish a Confidentiai

Fund, it will be necessary that the office urnish the Bureau full and complete

justification.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your

irmediate personal attention and supertision.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

RE: CONPIDENTIAL FUND

ACCOUNTING ERCCEDURES -

FBI. FORIT BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently being followed by the various field divisions which were

förwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

from a review of the suggestions submitted along with these

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling

the operations of the confidential Funds maintained by the various

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accpunting

procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Che shall be

used to reflect any transactions

that would affect the amount of

the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that.

nuulü affec unis rund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fund.

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau.

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received from the Informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balance

of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount to

be accounted for.

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be

utilized to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total

fund. This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample

(Exhibit Number Two), which reflects examples of various transactions

which will affect the Fund.

This ledger should be retained indef1-

nately and should be used as the basis for the preparation of the

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 84

## Page 85

monthly report.

All columns should

be ruled off at the end of the

calendar month and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number

One should reflect all cash recelpts and disbursements.

The debit

side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from

the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau.

All payments made

to criminal Informants and

sources should be reflected

in the

column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security informants

or sources should be reflected

"Security;"

and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either

of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone

companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box rental, etc.,

should be reflected in the column captioned "Miscellaneous."

The

credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds

from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous

payment.was of a criminal, security. or miscellaneous nature.

• Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the sureau;

checks

in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases

should

be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas any

refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which •

must be returned to the Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the

"Refunds" column.

Like-

wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be

recorded here. (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.)

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, 1.e., in either the

Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to

Bureau column. Ilkewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts

column, there

should be a

corresponding entry in one of the credit

columns, 1.e., In either the Refunds of Payments column or in the

Receipts from Bureau column.

- It is to be further noted that the totals of column

Number za will be of assistance in the preparation of the

"Sum-

mary of payments to Informants" In connection with the monthly

report. The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the credit side of column one

from the

3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources. • This section

of the ledger should be divided into three parts; namely, Criminal,

security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a

separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid

criminal confidential source.

divided into tro sections; namely, an unvouchered file ars a

vouchered file.

These icrms can be used by the employee

responsible

for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue

slips for submission

io the Bureau.

Of course, these blue slips

should not be prepared until such

time as the

receipt from the

informant 1s obtained from

the Agent making the payment, and in

those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by

Agent making the payment.

the

At the time the voucher is prepared, those

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

prepared

and retained in the accounts receivable file until reim-

bursement is made, by the Bureau. At the time reimbursement is

received, the voucher should be

removed together with the attach-

ments and

a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement

was received from the Bureau.

The Request for Funds forms attached

to the voucher may then be destroyed.

In the event an Item has

been suspended from the voucher and returned to the field office,

1t would

be necessary to remove

the Request for Funds form from

the voucher on wich the blüe vily vas requesued and revarned to

the unvouchered file until such time as it is resubmitted or 1t is

determined

It will not be resubmitted.

5. Monthly Report.

As you are aware, the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared

and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month following

the period during which the expenditures were made.

These reports

should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

the present form for this report have been suggested and after a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the

reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example

(Exhibit Number rive).

The monthly report

submitted to the Bureau

should be prepared under the direct supervision of the Special

Agent In Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly

designated

• Field

supervisor.

The fund should be audited once each

six months, on June 30 and december j1.

personally

This audit shall be

performed by a Special Agent Accountant. The report of

chis audit

shall be forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of

July and the twentieth day of January.

In those Instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training

and Inspection Division during a, regular inspection, the next

regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the speclal Agent

Accountant of the Field Division.

With regard to the summary of expenditures section of

the Confidential Report, It 1s desired to illustrate the following

points:

a. All transactions during the calendar

month should

be shown.

b.

All items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

c .

The explanation should reflect the

name and symbol number of the informant as

well as the period covered by the payment and

in case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief

statement to describe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund to be accounted for

must be fully explained in a cover memoran-

.aum. An examole of such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the Bureau. Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connestion with the summary of pagments to informante.

you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed

separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-

tion. This breakdown should include such payments as post office

box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank

charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for

prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants

or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them should be included

. under miscellaneous

expenditures.

6. Preparation of Blue Slips.

As was pointed out here-

tofore, the

blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment.to:the

informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the

payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant. A blue slip should be prepared at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the ltem have been

received from the Agent making the payment.

recent mateces

All blue sllos should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make

• proper review ol the expenditures. Samples are attached

reflecting payments made to informants under Eureau authority

(Exhibit Number Six): SAC authority (Exhibit Number Seven), and

miscellaneous expenditures (Exhibit Number Eight). These

samples

are general but should be used

as a guide for preparing all blue

slips.

In addition to the attached samples, it is desired that

the following

be kept in mind in connection with the preparation

of blue slips:

a. One blue slip should be used for each

payment. It is not desired to have numerous

payments listed

on a single blue slip in view

of the possibility of error which would result

in the necessity of suspending the entire blue

s11p; whereas if only one payment were

listed

on the blue sl1p, It would be possible to re-

turn only the one item and the remaining 1tems

could be processed for payment. "i

b.

The authority must be clearly reflected

on the blue slip.

When authority is based

on

the letter from

the Bureau, actual date of the

Bureau letter shall be used

as the date of the

authorization.

Then the field office, by letter,

requests authorization and receives notice that

authorization has been granted in the form of a

copy of the field office letter returned by the

Durces with

• tho Bureau approval champod thorooR,

the date of the authorization in this instance

shall be the actual date of the field office let-

ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

0 .

The actual period of time covered by the

payment to the informant must be reflected in the

body of the blue slip.

For example, see

reflected in body of

Exhibit Number

"Period"

SiX.

It is

also essential that the period covered be carefully

compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent

exceeding the Bureau authorization, both by time

and amount.

Receipts should be obtained whenever

possible.

In instances where they are not obtained

either because of the

refusal of the Informant to

execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain

one, the appropriate notation should be reflected

on the blue slip.

d. FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the

Agent reflecting receipt of money from

the SAC is

only to be used when the receipt signed by the

informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

be claimed

on a voucher of the

Charge.

If the receipt reflects payment was made

to the informant by the Assistant Special Agent in

Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed on a

voucher of the Assistant Special Agent in Charge.

In instances where the receipt reflects that payment

was made to the informant by someone other than the

blue slip may be submitted for payment on the

voucher of either the Special Agent in Charge

approval of the Special Agent in Charge; however,

the Special Agent in Charge may delegate authority

to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or an

approved field office supervisor to sign his name

as approving official followed by the initials of

the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or the

supervisor.

h. Receipts obtained by personnel which

reflect payments to informants and sources should

reflect the ACTUAL DATE payment 1s made to the

informant or source.

• The receipt should in no

Instance

The Receipt

ment to an official of the bank by name for serv-

ices rendered.

ant has been paid under Bureau authority, pay-

ments cannot be made under the authority of the

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A)

CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES - I want to draw to your attention

the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential

expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing Manual

provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility

of each Special Agent

• in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of Seat

of Government employees

to be judicious

in authorizing expenditures.

En ha mano and to practice propca euciving.

For your information, Inspectors will, in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine

the propriety of each expenditure and will trace

through the files information received and results obtainea,

following the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that

in the event an expenditure is encountered which is not proper

the employees involved will reimburse the Government.

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of

the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which it

is felt will eliminate some duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

The sug-

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to informants on SAC authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants. It was suggested that the

In-

formants' files be checked and

the amount paid prior to July 1,

1954, be entered on the Informants' individual ledger pages.

This would apply only to payments made under SAc authority.

It is felt that this

suggestion will

save considerable

time and work in the field. and vou are accordinglv instructed

to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting

procedure.

Very truly. yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

Ing items to your attention:

1. There has been a noticeable lack of receipts to support

blue slips.

Receipts should be obtained in every possible instance.

2. Failure to properly explain lack of receipts has been

noticed in numerous

instances.

If the informant refuses to execute

the receipt, a statement to that effecü should be included on the cius

this should be fully explained on the blue slip. This

does not apply to blue slips reclaiming bank charges.

3. All blue slips must show to whon the payment was actu

4. The receipt signed by the informant should reflect the

name of the person actually making payment. Any departure from this

should be fully explained on the blue slip.

5. In the future where a symbol number has been assigned

to the informant, only the symbol number should be reflected on tre

FD-221 and FD-221a forms; however, the name of the informant shall te

In the preparation of future blue slips, the

following instructions should be adhered to:

The blue

the name used by the informant in signing a receipt for

payment must be explained

on the blue slip. When a name

other than the Individual's full correct name is used in

Initial development as an Informant, his full correct name

should be used on the blue slip as soon as lt is known,

together with references to the previous names used in

contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure 1s necessary to enabls the

Bureau In porpoily inciul payments and to make sure that

811 payments to one individual are consolidated. It has

been noted In some instances that blue silps are submitted

snoring the full name and on subsequent payments they are

submitted showing the individual's miádle name as & last

This 1s especially true In connection with Spanish

names. This practice leads to the possibility of carrying

a separate account of payments under each name.

Make sure that the necessary employees of your

office are aware of this and the need for consistency.

In addition, where an informant or individual

the blue slip claiming reimburse-

This 1s necessary to Insure that the

(D) UTILIZATION OF FORM FD- 221a - INFORMANT MATTERS --

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

" the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

FD-221 and informant receipts. The matter concerning security 10r

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security.

MENORANDU: FOR

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Sir:.

In connection with expenditures of a conidential nature

for which reimbursement is claimed by blue slip, jouaro advised that

such

expenditures rust be linited strictly to investigative cases

of major importance merein monies may be raiu to confidential

informants or lor confidential purposes, reimburserent for wich

could not be claimed by regular personal service voucher mithout

jeopardizing the successiul completion of the investigation.

You are, therefore, savised that it will not be neces

sary to continue

the retention oi copies of confidential blue

slips in the various fieid division files.

The present field

blue slip files should be foriarded lo the Washington head-

quarters of the Bureau under personal and confidential cover.

Very truly yours,

Dear Sir:

It has been noted in connection with confidential

disbursements being made by special agents for which reit-

bursement is claired by blue slip thet in many instances the

receipt is executed in the name of an agent or person other

than the agent claiming reimbursement.

It is desired that whenever possible the receipt

be made in the rame of the agent who pays the bill and who

will claim reimbursement. It is understood. that in all

instances this will noù se practical, for instance, if agent

Smith makes arrangements for the renual of an apartment ior

surveillance purposes

and he is later transferred from this

assignment the bill ordinarily will be continued in his name and

paid by another agent.

In instances such as this the agent

who pays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per

sonally paid same and that he is claiming reimbursement there

for. If the receipt is made out in the aame of an alias

boing ussd by the usunt this duct should be explained in the

blue slip.

In those instances iàere payment is made to an

informant for services rendered over a definite period the

date of the beginning and ending of the perica shouta be

indicated on the blue slir.

This natter should be brought to the attention of

all special agents under your supervision and the blue slips

sibmitted should be carefully checked by you to see that they

conform iriin the above instructions.

Close attention to this

matter irill obviate the necessity for returning expense accounts

for correction.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

The Bureau has noted an inereasing trend on the part of Special

Aguou in Chango un apiurina Confidenuial expendlures wich bay at sole

time be subject to question.

The Sureas refers particularly to those ex-

penditures made by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential informants.

It has been necessary for the. Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

imburse certain Agents for expenditures nade when it appeared that tre

penditures made were out of line in so far as necessity for the securing..

of the information ras concerned.

The Bureau has further noted a terdency

growing up in the fleld for Special Agents in charge to approve contidential

expenditures for l0g and l5% and other very minor amounts nich probably

should be subject io further scrutiny by the Spacial Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenditures but eust insist that each Special Agent in Charge perscnally

review and approve suon expenditures as are made by enployees under his

jurisdiction.

It is understood that with the type of internal security

work presently being performed by a great many Special Agents, certain

necessary, expenditures must be made in connection with physical surveil-

lances and like maiters;

however, it should be understood that a Special

Agent, in so far as food and entertainment are concerned, is under certain

MODEFENSexpense at the present time, even though he is not assigned to conridentia?

survaillances ard when any charge is made for reimbursement for expenditino

BUY made by him in connection with the succassful handling of a surveillance

united matter, only that portion of the charge which would be over and above his

snags regular living expenses should be submitted.

"The confidantial infornation item as above was paid in the

mitted and is now and will be held in the confidential files

of the Federal Bareau of Investigation and will be open to

inspection for any purpose by the representative of the Comp-

troller General at any time he may desire."

The Bureau will continue its present policy of returning to any

Agent without reimcursesent any confidential expenditure which does not ap-

pear to be fully and thoroughly justified. The Bureau must, of course, in-

sist on each Social Agent in Charge making it his personal responsibility:

without delegation to other subordinate employees the review of confidential

expenditures: to definitsly ascertain that the expenditure has been proper

and that the expenditure of the funds in question has been of material bene-

fit and advantage to the Government.

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time

,of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential

fund and the submission of monthly reports in connection therewith.

You are aware, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential

that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the

confidential fund in each field office, including therein ils status

with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements mich

have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-

mit such monthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurave

record upon the basis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent in Charge may be definitely determinea.

In this connection, a revien of blue slip items received at

the Bureau over a ceriod of time reflects an increasing number of Day-

ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10

to 920. At the time the monthly statement is subaitted by the field

office

involved, such statements invariably fail to indicate that the

experditures in question vere "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances.they are improperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712

Page 134

---

## Page 135

-2-

an accurate accounting on the part of the sureau in respect thereto.

For. your gaidance in the preparation of future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which ouulines briefly and succinctly

the manner in mhich disbursements, advances, refunds; or purchases

are to be listed. All subsequent

monthly statenents prepared by

your office should be submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Special Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the

expenditures for which reimbursement is being clained through blue

slips.

For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-

odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been secured.

It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of

a money order and the money order receipt autached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-

ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren-

dared by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of

a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the bureau is necessarily aware of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for

confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise

practicable to do so.

Hereaîter, confidential items will be sus-

pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beading, clothing, and

related items utilized in the conduct of various plants and other

confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the field office inventories.

Accordingly, it is

desired that you forward to the Burcau in the near future a detailed

report indicating the type and quantity oi such equipment purchased

and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the Bureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by each of the respective field offices

having control, custody, or possession of such equipment.

With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices vill

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate non-expendable receiving slips.

Such slips should indi-

cate that the item was purchased through the submission of blue

slips.

The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted.

and suspensions frow the vouchers will be made in those instances

where field offices lail to submit non-expendable receiving slips..

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 135

Accordingly,

desired that the non-exper

payment.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein

attention and supervision: It is expected

that in the

future

there will be strict compliance with the foré

going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

cies may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

IIC: AUTZORIZING IUPENDITURES

FROM CORFTDENTIAL FUND

It has been noted that various officials and supervisors are granting.

authority to the fiela offices to make expenâitareg from the field office

confidential fund.

Winen Bureau authority has been grantea for an expenditure

of this nature, the field office is required to sive such auchorization on the

confidential iten submitted to recleim the exteraiture.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expenditures. In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the Administrative Division, it is roted that in rany instances there

till be no recora of the expenditure having been euthorized. .

In the future when authorization is granted for expenditures of this

nature, the Administrative Division rust be advised. Ií the field office 1s

granted authority by letter, a copy of the letter must be rade for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517. If authority is granted telepnonically, it will be necessary

that the official or supervisor granting the authority notify the Administrative

Division by nehornam, giving the name of the person to wnom payment is authorizea

and the field office involved.

The above instructions are to be placed into effect immediately in ordes

to preclude the delay which is now being experienced in determining whether the

expenditures claimed by the various offices were properly authorized.

It has b

noted that in a great number

instances Special Agents

have not been sucmitting receipts to justiîy the experditures for which re-

Imbursements are beirg clained through blue slips. The Bureau is awere of the

fact that receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to

exigencies peculiar to certain types of activities, nevertheless, receipts

should be obtained wherever possible.

In connection with the preparation of the blue slips it has been

noted that sore are being prerared too much in detail. In those instances where

the payment is rade to an authorized regular paid informant, the following

Infornation is surficient to suppori the claim:

Amount of payment

3.

Name and symbol number of Informant

Case

Date of authorization letter or teletype

5. Period of payment

A sample forn reflocting the proper method for preparing a blue sliv

1s attached.

The Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re

claming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the voucher that

the item was

suspended Iron a previous voucher. It is rointed out that no reference shouid

be made to the previous roacher nor should the igent state that the item was

suspended unless he forwards the original Steterent of Difference with the

roucher.

Your attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a

limited amount of funds available to operate the Confidential. Funds of the

field divisions, therefore, you should make every effort to operate on your

present fund.

It is pointed out that a more frequent submission of Confidential

Fund vouchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the fund.

In the future when an office desires to establish a Confidential

Fund, it will be necessary that the office furnish the Bureau full anà complete

justification.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your

Immediate personal

considerable increases in such expenditures are being made in the

Its informant coverage.

The Bureau wishes to poirt out to you, however, that it is

your personal responsibility to see

that such expenditures are totally

justified in every instance where made.

you should insure yourself

that the bureau is receiving full value for the funds experded by it.

Effective immediately, you are instructed that in any in

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

June 9, 1954

FASHINGTON 25, D.C.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND

ACCCUNTING PROCEDURES -

FBI FORM BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently being followed by the various field aivisions which were

forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

and from a review of the suggestions submitted along with

these

aporarat has been dete,

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for hanaling

the operations of the confidential Funds maintained by the various

field divisions should be established.

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accpunting

procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Che shall be

used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of

the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that

nuüiu aideco unis lund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fund.

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau,

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received from the informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balance

of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount

-to

be accounted for.

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be

utilized to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total

fund.

This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample

(Exhibit Number Two, which reflects examples of various transactions

which will affect the Fund.

This ledger should be retained Indefi-

nitely and should be used as the basis for the preparation of the

NW 55320 DocId:32989712 Page 157

## Page 158

monthly report. All columns should be ruled off at the end of the

calendar month and the cash balance brought forward.

Column Number

One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements.

The debit

side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from

the fund except any refunds made to the Bureau.

All payments made

to criminal informants and sources should be reflected in the

column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security informants

or sources snould be reflected in the column captioned

"security;"

and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either

of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone

companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box rental, etc.,

should be

reflected in the column captioned "Miscellaneous."

credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds

from payments previcusly made regardless of whether the previous

payment. was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous natüre.

• Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;

checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases

should

be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas any

refund from an Informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which

must be returned to the Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the

"Refunds" column.

Like-

wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be

recorded here. (Note entries, Exhibit Number Iwo.)

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, 1.e., In either the

Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to

Bureau column.

Likewise, for every entry in the Casn Receipts

column, there

should be a

corresponding entry in one of the credit

columns, 1.e., In either the Refunds of Payments column or in the

Receipts from

Bureau column.

- It 1s to be further noted that the totals of column

Number za will be of assistance in the preparation of the

"sum-

mary of Payments to Informants" in connection with the monthly

The

amount of cash on hand can

always be determined by

subtracting the total

of the creait side of Column one from the

total of the debit side of this column.

3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources.

This section

of the ledger should be divided into three parts; namely, criminal,

security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a

separate page for each paid criminal Informant and each paid

criminal confidential source.

The security section should reflect

a separate page for each paid security informant and each paid

confidential source.

Under the Miscellaneous section, pages

should be set up for rental of space for plants or surveillances,

regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the Confidential

Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regulai

basis.

Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-

rants, rental of safe deposit boxes, etc., may be included on a

single page as the expenaltures come up.

A sample of an informant

oage is attached Exhibit Number Three. It is to be noted that

this page reitects the following information:

a, the date of authorization

b. the authorization

c. period covered by payment

date of payment.

e. amount of payment

In connection with the date of authorization, you are

instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter

to the field division in cases where authorization is made by

Bureau letter and

the date of the Incoming letter when authorization

is made by stamping "approved" on a tickler copy of a letter

received from the field division requesting

authority.

Before making any disbursements from the confidential

Fund to an informant,

the authonization should to shocked

sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and that the

period covered by the

the payment cate

payment is in agreement with the existing

authorization. These authorizations should be posted in the

ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau.

In conrection

with sAc authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

is being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July I, 1954, the present serial in the informant's

file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

•date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954;

form FD-228 should be removed from your form book and your supply

destroyed.

4. After a careful review of the many suggestions received

in response to SAC Letter Number 54-0, a lorm (FD-235 Icr request

ine funds from the confidential Fund has been designed, a coDy oI

which is attached. You may print a supply of this form

for use in

your office. FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have

been approved for your office.

A COpy of FD-235 is to be placed in

the FBI Form Book.

This form

should be prepared in duplicate by

the Agent requesting the funds, and after approval by the Agent

supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the SAC for his approval

before

any disbursement 1s made from the Confidential Fund. After

approval of the form by the sAc and aiter the employee handling

the disbursements frcm the fund has carefully verified that the

payment is in accordance with existing authority, one copy of the

• form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file which should be

divided Into two sections; namely, an unvouchered file ari a

vouchered file.

These forms can be used by the employee responsible

for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue

slips for submission io the Bureau.

oi course, these blue slips

should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the

Informant is obtained from the Agent making the payment, and In

those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the

Agent making

• the payment.

At the time the voucher is prepared, those

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

prepared and retained in the accounts

receivable file until reim

bursement is made, by the Bureau.

At the time reimbursement 1s

received,

the voucher should be removed

together with the attach-

ments and

a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement

was received from the Bureau.

The Request for Funds forms attached

to the voucher may then be destroyed.

returned to the field office,

It would be necessary to remove

5. Monthly Report.

As you are aware, the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential rund is presently prepared

and submitted to the bureau by the twentieth of the month following

the period during wnich the expenditures were made.

These reports

should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

the present form for this report have been suggested

and after a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the

reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example

(Exhibit Number Five).

The monthly report submitted to the Bureau

should be prepared under

the airect supervision of the Special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent In Charge or a regularly

designated Field Supervisor.

The fund should be audited

once. each

personally periormed by a Special

Arent accountant.

In those instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training

Inspection Division auring a, regular inspection, the next

• regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the fleld Division.

With regard to the summary of expenditures section of

the Confidential Report, It 1s desired to illustrate the following

points:

a. All transactions during the calendar

month should be shown.

b.

All Items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

C .

The explanation should reflect the

name

and symbol number of the informant as

well as the period covered by the payment and

In case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief

statement to describe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund to be accounted for

musi be fully explained in a cover memoran-

.dum. An example of such a transaction would

be a refund received Irom an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the BureaU.

Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connostion with the summary sê paymente to infoamante.

you are advised that ail miscellaneous payments must be listed

separately frcm payments made to informants or sources of informa-

tion.

This

breakdown should include such payments as post office

box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank

charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for

prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants

or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them should be included under miscellaneous

expendltures.

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed out here-

tofore, the

blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment to:the

informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant.

A blue slip should be prepared at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been

received from the Agent making the

payment.

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make

a proper review of the expenditures. Samples are attached

reflecting payments made to informants under Eureau authority

In addition to the attached samples, It 1s desired that

the following

be kept in mind in connection

with the preparation

of blue slips:

&. One blue slip should be used for each

payment. It is not desired to have numerous

payments listed on a single blue slip in view

of the possibility of error which would

result

In the necessity of suspending the entire blue

slip; whereas If only one payment were

listed

on the blue s1lp, 1t would be possible to re-

turn only the one Item and the

remaining 1tems

could be processed for payment. ":

It 1s

also essential that the period covered be carefully

and amount.

Receipts

should be obtained whenever

possible.

In instances where they are not obtained

either because of the refusal of the Informant to

execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain

one, the appropriate notation should be rerlected

on the blue slip.

d. FD-221 which 1s a receipt signed by the

Agent reflecting receipt of money from

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES - I want to draw to your attention

the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential

expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing kanual

provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibillty of Seat

of Goverrment employees to be judicious in authorizing expenditures

En he mano ara to practice proger economy.

For your Information, Inspectors will, in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine the propriety of each expenditure and will trace

through the files information received and results obtained,

folloring the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that

in the event an expenditure is encountered which is not proper

the employees involved will reimburse the Government.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -

ACCCUNTING PROCEDURE'S

Reference 13 nade to No Number SAC Letter 54-0 which

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of

the confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which 1t

is felt will eliminate sore duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

The sug

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to informants on SAC authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants. It was suggested that the

in-

formants' files be checked and

the amount paid prior to July 1,

1954,

be entered on the informants' individual ledger pages.

This would apply only to payments made under SAc authority.

It is felt that this

suggestion will save considerable

time and work in the field. and vou are accordinalv instructed

to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting

procedure.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(D) UTILIZATION OF FORM FD-221a - INFORMANT MATTERS -

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

" the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

FD-221 and informant receipts. The matter concerning security for

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security:

RE:

SECURITY INFORMANTS AND

SOURCES - INCOME TAXES

No Number SAC Letter 63-E dated March 27, 1963, contained full

details and instructions for a withholding plan through which it was hoped

security informants could satisfy their Federal income tax obligations

arising from payments made to them for services without jeopardizing

their security. The plan was tried or a limited basis and has proven to be

sourd and effective. As a result, it will be expanded to include all field

divisions effective January 1, 1965. Under the plan, payments to certain

security informants and sources for services rerdered will be subject to a

20 per cent withholding tax.

There are four categories of circumstarces in which taxes will

not be withheld. Taxes are not to be withheld from payments made (1) to

other than security informants and sources, (2) for reimbursement of

expenses, (3) under SAC authority, or (4) to informants who have been able

to report Bureau income on their Federal tax returns without jeopardizing

their security or without challenge from the Internal Revenue Service.

To place the plan into effect, you should immediately review the

personal situation of each security informant and source. Where circumstances

warrant using the procedure, the matter should be discussed with each informant

or source involved. It should be explained to each that the withholding procedure

to be placed into effect January 1, 1965, is being adopted to afford a secure

method of meeting Federal income tax obligations in regard to money receired

from the FBI for services. The Bureau must be adrised by November 1, 1964,

of the identity of each informant to be exempted from this program and the

method to be used by each in reporting his Bureau income.

In operating the plan, you should be alert to streamline the procedures.

For example, instructions call for a check to be drawn for the gross amount of

an authorized payment. After it is cashed, the amount to be withheld for taxes

is deducted and deposited in the special checking accourt; however, it is not

necessary to make.

a deposit in connection with each such transaction. If it

would simplify the matter, there would be no objection to making one deposit

at the end of each day for the total amount of money withheld that day from

payments to all informants.

(E) PAYMENTS TO COXFIDENTIAL INFORKANTS - The Bureau has received inquiries

regarding the amount a Special Agent in Charge may approve paying an informant

without prior Bureau authority.

You are advised you may approve payment of an amount up to $50 to an

informant in a specific instance for information subnitted. The blue slips

submitted for clairing these payments must clearly and adequately explain the

circumstances and summarize the infornation obtained so the Bureau will be in

a position to intelligently pass such

slips for payment, receipts to be attachea

wherever possible.

This does not change the present instructions that prior Bureau author-

ity must be obtained before paying an informant on a regular basis at a rate

exceeding S10 per month, but applies only to specific instances in which it is

expedient or necessary to expend money to obtain information concerning matters

or persons under investigation which information is not otherwise obtainable.

'his of course does not apply to expenditures for entertainment. You will be

held responsible to insure the Bureau receives full value for all the money

expended by you and such matters must receive your personal attention and ap-

proval.

(C) CONFIDENTIAL INFORNANTS - Full coverage of all our investigative activities

must be naintained

and the use of paid confidential informants is necessary. With

out a constant and

careful check of the production of these paid informants, it is

possible that full value will not be received for the

services rendered.

You are instructed, therefore, to personally review all reports submitted

by paid confidential informants either National Defense or General Investigative

to be certain that they are providing information commensurate with the amount of

money being paid to them. If it is determined after a personal check of each paid

confidential informant that the Bureau is not receiving an adequate return, pay-

ments should be immediately discontinued and the Bureau advised. Likewise, if

you feel that any informant's compensation should be adjusted based upon a de-

crease of his activity, a summary should ce furnished to the Bureau together with

vase recommondatione concorning a dicago iri jagauù iè iii.

After you have completed this check of all paid confidential informants,.

you should continue to afforà this matter your personal attention to insure the

Bureau at all times receiving a full return for any money paid to informants.

thenever

your recommendation is not aunloved, correspondence will be prepared

(D) "SECURITY INFCRMANTS - CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - PAYMENTS -- A SIt-

Juation recently arose

whereby

an Informant complained that he signed

receipts for money which he did not receive from the contacting

Agent. It developed,

that the Agent was in the habit of obtaining

a receipt for a specific Bureau-authorized amcunt, but if in the

opinion of the Agent the Informant did not deserve the full amount,

only a part of. the authorized sum would be furnished to the Informant

at the

time the receipt was obtained. The Agent would then deposit

to his own personal account the sum which he had not given to the

informant with the idea in mind of later furnishing to the informant

from his personal account an appropriate sum when he felt the

Informant deserved the additional money.

As a result, confusion

arose as to whether the informant received the fully authorized sum.

This type of operation, of course, results in falsification

of records and. Is highly Improper. The handling of Government funds

1s a serious responsibility and all employees should exercise good

judgment at all times.

Whenever anyone in the Bureau's service 1s

charged with

the duty of handling Government money, the rules and

regulations in connection therewith must be strictly followed. If

a receipt is obtained from an informant, or anyone else, the

iscipleit luai be paid in sull in accordance with the receipt.

I want each Special Agent in Charge to review carefully

the methods presently in operation in his Division concerning the

handling of the confidential fund, particularly as it relates to

informants, and make certain that disbursements and receipts are

being handled in the proper fashion.

You are reminded that the proper maintenance and handling

of the contidential fund is your personal responsibility and it is

imperative that the Bureau's regulations be followed expliciely..

INFORMANTS - You are reminded of the need to closely follow matters

involving payments to informants to insure that the Bureau is getting full

value for money expended and that the record shows complete justification

for all payments made.

Requests for authority to pay informants must be supported

by a summary of the information previously furnished in sufficient detail

to allow an intelligent analysis at the Bureau. The communication should

also show anticipated future coverage informant will provide and an

appraisal of the informant's value. You should also outline the nature of

the expenses incurred by the informant for which payment is being

requested. Payments for services must be made on a strictly c.o.d.

basis, and payments for expenses can onlr cover expenses actually -

incurred by the informant in obtaining iniormation fet the Bureau.

(H) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently there

were held at the Seat of Government specialized conferences concerning

militant black nationalist investigations and racial informant matters.

These conferences were attended by representatives from key field

offices handling the major portion of the Bureau's work in this field.

The conferees

were unanimous in their observation that

money is the primary motivating force in developing racial informants.

In view of this,

they recommended that each Special Agent in Charge be

given authority to expend up to $400 in the development of racial

informants instead of the $200 the majority of Special Agents in Charge

• may now expend on their own authority.

I concur with this recommendation of the conferees and .

effective March 15, 1968, the Special Agents in Charge of all field

divisions are authorized to expend the sum of $400 in the development

of racial informants. In this connection, you are reminded that money

expended for informant development must be on a c.o.d. basis and full

value must be received in proportion io the amount of money expended.

Appropriate Manual change will be forthcoming.

(D) SECURITY INFORAIANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS - AS yOu

are aware, all security informants and sources receiving compensation

from the Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information

furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has

been noted that some informants and sources have been paid consistently

the same amount each month with no variation in payments during

periods when the informants or sources were less productive, which

leads to the illogical implication that information furnished or expenses

incurred or both seldom, if ever, vary.

This practice must be

discontinued. Your informants and sources must understand they are

independent contractors remunerated on a C.O. D. basis, and they must

never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary..

This matter will continue to receive careful consideration

al the Seat of Government and you will be held accountable to insure

that payments are for value received and no fixed patterns continue to

develop. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling security informants and

sources.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - SUBMISSION OF JUSTIFICATION

LETTERS -- Effective immediately justification letters for security

informants should be submitted each six months instead of each four

months as was previously required. Current authorized payments for

four months should be considered extended to six months from the

effective date. Under item four, requiring a "summary of information

furnished and/or services rendered during pertinent period, " you

should henceforth include a brief statement as to what coverage or

information furnished is available only from that source. In the event

there, is none, a specific statement to that effect should be set out..

As I have previously emphasized, it is the responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to insure all expenditures for information

are on a c.o.d. basis commensurate with the value of the information.

Excessive coverage of routine matters resulting in unwarranted

expenditures for the same incormation must not be approved. Good

judgment must be exercised and, where possible and warranted, efforts

of established informants must be directed into areas where increased

-coverage is poored, auch ae the Now Teft and nther radical subversive

groups. You must not be complacent with mere numbers but take

positive steps to insure your coverage of subversive groups is suf-

ficiently flexible to adequately meet the Bureau's responsibilities in this

reminded of the necessity that automotive equipment used in surveillances

you are authorized io make appropriate use of renial equipment where

necessary; however: It is your responsibility to see that such rental

equipment is compietely iustified. Whenever such use will be extensite

the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and equipment

in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way

jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped

surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatment.

The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment

separately from our normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.

Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the

same separate lacilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance

trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance

(B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you are aware

informants and sources receiving compensation from the Bureau are

reimbursed on the basis of the value of the information reported,

services performed and expenses incurred. An increasing tendency

has been observed in fieid submissions to request special payments or

justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based

- on personal needs ci the informant as distinct from the value of infor-

mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred.

The

personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness

or other pressing necessity for funds, do not meet the basic criteria

of information furnished or related expenses. Informants should not

be influenced to believe we.will pay for such personal needs. The

basic concept that the informant is selling information of value on a

c.o.à. basis, much as an independent contractor, and is not an

employee must be adheredto and understood by contacting Agents and

the informants.

This does not, however, preclude use of imagination and in-

muraiûu tich u source of consiniorable potential value needs financial

inducement to engage in gathering of iniormation under conditions which

will take time to reach fruition and may involve considerable risk and

hardship. In such instances you should fully develop the facts and

present them to FBIHQ for approval prior to making any commitment.

This matter will continue to receive careful attention at FBIHQ

and you will be held accountable to insure that payments are for value

received. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling informants and sources.
