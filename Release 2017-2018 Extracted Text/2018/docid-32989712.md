“A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal income tax on
monies received from the-Bureau without jeopardizing their security. This plan
will go into effect immediately in the San Francisco and Philadelphia Offices for
a trial period of one year. Payments for services to certain security informants
and sources will be subject to a twenty per cent withholding tax. No tax is to be
withheld from payments made (1) to other than security informants and sources,
(2) for reimbursement of expenses, (3) under the authority of the SAC or (4) to
informants who have been able to report Bureau income on their Federal tax
returns without jeopardizing their security or without challenge from IRS, In
the latter instance, the Bureau must be advised as to the identity of each
informant and the method used by him to report his Bureau income.

: Proper records must be maintained of amgunts withheld and such
amounts must.be placed in a special checking account. ‘At the end of the tax
year, the tax liability will be determined on money paid by the Bureau to those
informants from whom tax has been withheld. Necessary adjustments will be
worked out with the informants and the net amount withheld forwarded to the
Bureau. This money will be turned over to a special representative of IRS
without disclosure as to identities of informants, except for coded numbers.
These numbers can later be used for identification purposes in the event it
becomes, necessary to substantiate income tax payments. t

Other offices may now utilize the withholding system where it
would be-helpful; however, where it is not used, continue to instruct all informants
to pay their taxes on income received from the Bureau by such method as may
be proper and feasible.

Detailed instrugtions and exhibits are enclosed concerning the
-procedure to be followed in the accounting and control of money withheld.

_ WITHHOLDING OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX |
FROM PAYMENTS ‘TO INFORMANTS AND SOURCES

INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEDURES

Introduction:

A system has been worked’ out with the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal
income tax on monies'’received from the Bureau without jeopardizing
their security. This will require the withholding of twenty per cent
of any payments being made to suche individuals for services rendered.
Money so withheld will be immediately deposited to a special checking
account, to be used for this purpose only, set up in the name of the
SAC and ASAC. This account shotild, if possible, be in a different bank
than that in which the regular office Confidential Fund (blue slip) or
Double Agent (white slip) accounts are maintained. Any bank charges
incidental, to this special checking account are to be paid from the
regular office Confidential Fund. .Attached to these instructions are
10 Exhibits which are to be used as guides in setting up records for
the maintenance and operations of the withholding accounts. Hereafter,
any teference to informants refers to both informants and sources.

This plan will apply only to those informants or groups of
informants authorized by the Bureau.

Accounting Instructions: .

ca When a payment is to be made to an informant subject to this
plan, the amount to be withheld for income tax purposes will be
twenty per cent of the total for services. A check will be drawn on
the regular office Copfidential Fund to cover the total amount of the
authorized payment. This check will be cashed and the amount for taxes
immediately deposited in the special checking accouht set up for this

‘ purpose. A duplicate deposit slip is to be obtained for use in posting

to the ledger accounts. Payment to the informant will then follow and
the receipt to be executed by the informant for ‘such payment should show
not only the amount received as reimbursement for expenses and the
authorized payment for services, but also the amount withheld for

Enclosures (10) +

NW 55320 DocId:32989712 Page 35


Federal income tax purposes (Exhibit 1). A Record of Income Tax
Transactions (Exhibits 2 ‘and 3) will “be maintained on a calendar-year
basis to record the informant's name, symbol number, period covered,
and the amounts’incidental to such transactions. Beginning with the
first payment to an informant involving tax withholding, a new
individual ledger sheet (Exhibits 4 and 5) must beset up. The amount
o£ money withheld for income tax purposes should also be listed on
the Blue Slip, Form FD 37, prepared with respect to the payment
(Exhibit: 6).

At the end of each month, entries in the Record of Income Tax
Transactions and the individual informant's ledgers will be totaled
and reconciled. A monthly report (Exhibit 7) is to be mailed to the
Bureau in the same manner as the reports for the regular office :
Confidential Fund, no later than the 20th of the following month. All
payments involving the tax account must be vouchered prior to the
submission of this report.

In the event an informant subject to this plan is transferred
to another field division, all records must be forwarded to the new
field division, together with a check for the amount of income tax
withheld. « a

Determinirig Informant's Tax Obligation:

+

At the end of the tax year, the contacting Agent will obtain
from the informant his compieted Federal income tax return based on his
regular income, exclusive of money paid to him by the Bureau. The
contacting Agent will not question the accuracy of the return except to
point out obvious errors. The contacting Agent will furnish the
informant's tax return to a qualified Special Agent Accountant who will
prepare a separate return to include Bureau income. The accountant will
complite the tax’ owed by informant on the combined earnings. The
difference between the tax computed by the informant and that computed
by the accountant will represent the amount of tax to be paid by the
informant on money received from the Bureau. The accountant who
prepared the return will sign on'the line "Signature of Preparer Other
Than the Taxpayer." The contacting Agent will havé the informant sign
the return prepared by the accountant as a certification that the
informant has reviewed it and found it correct in every respect. The
informant will file his original tax return with the Internal Revenue .
Service (IRS). The return prepared by the accountant, together with a
Photostat of the informant's original return, israel be * maintained in the
informant's Subfile,

NW 55320 DocId:32989712 Page 36 2


. If the amount withheld from- payments “to the informant during
the year exceeds the amount of tax for his Bureau income, the refund
due the informant will be withdrawn from the special checking account
and paid to him at the time he signs the return prepared by the
accountant. A receipt (Exhibit 8) must be obtained from him. If the
amount withheld during the year is*not sufficient to cover the tax on
Bureau income, the difference should be collected from thé informant
and a statement (Exhibit 9) obtained from him. Entries for any
adjustments, either refunds or additional payments, must be made in
both the informant's ledger (Exhibits 4 and 5) and the Record of
Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2): for the calendar year involved.

Instructions to Informants: a
The contacting Agent must, fully explain the withholding

procedure to any informant concerned. With regard to the informant's

original tax return, the informant should clearly understand that

(1) neither the contacting Agent» nor the Special Agent Accountant is

in any way certifying to its accuracy, (2) if his original tax return

is questioned by IRS, it will be up to him to, settle the matter with

IRS, and he cannot plead that it has been examined and approved by an

Agent of the FBI, since such*statement is false and the informant would

be uncovered,

Transmittal of Tax to Bureau:

After all adjustments have been made in the income tax
withholding on payments to informants, a report of Federal Income Tax
. Deductions (Exhibit 10) will be prepared, The net amount of the tax
indicated'on the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) will
be withdrawn from the special checking account by means of a check made
payable to the Chief Clerk, FBI. This report and check will be forwarded
to the Bureau, together with receipts for refunds that have been made
and statements of additional tax collected. The necessary entries
showing the transmittal of the tax funds to the Bureau should be made in
the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2). When received at
the Bureau, the tax money will be turned over to a special representative
.of IRS with the amounts ‘for each informant identified by a coded number;
thus, the informant's connection with the FBI will be protected.
However, the coded number can be used for identification purposes in
the event it becomes necessary to substantiate the informant's income tax

payment.

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES*- 7
- . INCOME: TAXES a : eo,

No Number SAC Letter 64-E dated July 6, 1964, advised that
effective January 1, 1965, all field divisions must utilize the Bureau
Federal income tax withholding plan for payments to security informants
and sources. In order to place the plan in effect, you were to discuss
the matter with each informant and source where circumstances warranted
using the procedure and advise the Bureau by November 1, 1964, of the
identity of each exempted informant and the method used by each such
individual in reporting his Bureau income.

Communications being yeceived from the field indicate that
the plan is being utilized for many informants but, at the same time,
there are a great many instances where the informant has not had any
difficulty in reporting his Bureau income in the past-and, therefore,
these informants are being exempted by the field from the withholding
plan. The procedure was devised by the Bureau to afford informants
a method of reporting Bureau income in a’ secure manner and should
be utilized wherever-necessary to prevent any embarrassing situations
in the future such as those which occur when an informant finds it
necessary to disclose his receipt of income from the FBI in response
to inquiries from Internal Revenue Service or it is later found that
taxes‘ have not been paid on Bureau income. There should be no further
instances of this type and you are reminded that if situations do arise
in the future where it is learned informants aré not reporting Bureau
income and they have not used the withholding procedure, administrative
action will be considered by the Bureau in each such case.

Very truly yours,
“John Edgar Hoover «4

ha undividval who furnishes valuable information within our crimingl
investigative jurisdiction or concerning other criminal matters of
interest to the Bureau

Bo ILLUSTRATION .
This type informant includes members of the underworld, those who closely
associate with oriminals or have intimate krowledge of criminal activities.
Typical examples of such persons are madams, prostitutes, pimps, fences,
con men, hijackers, robbers, burglars, hcodlums, gangsters,and those
individuals who associate with or have knowledge of such persons,

C.° CBSERVATION

The listing of an individual as an approved Burcau informant is dependent

upon whether be or she can regularly furnish valuable criminal information,

In most instances 4n individual will be approved who has:

1. Furnished worth-while-information in two or more Bureau cases

2. Purnished wort ile information in one Bureau case and bahia chan

.t average information{relating to criminal intelligence investigevions ]

3. Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in
one other state or local case which is acted upon by the responsible
authorities so as to obtain corroboration of the. informant's report

4o Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in
one other Federal case which is acted upon by the intérested Federal
agency, so as to obtain corroboration of the informant's report

De DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

1, One of the most important responsibilities of an Agent is the identi-
fication of prospective criminal informants and the development of pros—
pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute
information to the Bureau.

20 Criminal informants are used to:

a, Solve cases

ve Lveave fugitives amu wabuesses

c, Report cases we would not otherwise receive
a. Report plans to commit offenses

e. Advise of general criminal activities

3.0 %Informants are developed from those who volunteer to be of assistance;
from subjects in cases investigated; from persons interviewed during
investigations; and from selected prospects who are clearly in @ posi-
tion to obtain worth-while information, Their development free tly
requires patient, protracted effort to find a basis for persuaiin
them to cooperate in furnishing information.

4 Care must be exercised in attempting to persuade individuals to act as
informants to avoid any allegations of undue influence, An individual
who is in custody and who offers to furnish information generally does
so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in return.

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity or any reduction in sentence
to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves
in a position where they might subsequently be acoused of having done so.

5. Once an individual has started to cooperate and furnishes information
.of value, his continued cooperation can frequently be assured through
payments for services rendered and information furnished, There should
be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to informants who
supply substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain
the assistance.

6. Another important factor in the initial problem of getting a potential
informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treatment
sometimes generated during the handling of a case, Agents must be alert
to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects and to capitalize on
them, Should a subject indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,
and should he be qualified to act as a real informant by virtue of his
background and associates, then affirmative action should be tuken to re-
contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities.

K. DEPARTMENT POLICY AND OPINION
The Department has issued instructions to tell all USAs that informants of
the Bureau shall not be interviewed or subpoenaed without prior consent of the
Department. Any deviation from this policy should be immediately brought to
the Bureauts attention, ‘

On 7-10-52 the Department furnished an opinion regarding the question whether
an informant could be prosecuted for technically violating the law while
attempting to obtain evidence regarding a Federal violation, The Department
stated ".,.If the intent throughout was to assist the government agents in
the enforcement of the law, and-not to violate or to fcoover-up! for a vio-
lation of the law, it is nct believed 2 case for prosecution could be made
against such an informer...."

"The procedures to be followed by informers working under the supervision

of your agents in the aia of enforcing the statutes coming within your jurisdic—
tion largely rests upon your sound discretion.,.,It is not believed that an
informer would be otherwise immune from prosecution for actions which would
subject a Federal enforcement officer to prosecution,”

L. TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM
1, The top echelon criminal informant program is aimed specifically at developing
informants who can provide a continuous flow of quality criminal intelli-
gence information regarding the leaders of organized criminal activity
throughout the nation. It is directed at developing informants in the
following categories:
a. Informants who are members of La Cosa Nostra (LCN)
bd. Informants who can furnish significant information regarding other
organized criminal groups a
c. Informants at the top level of organized gambling activity who can
provide information that will enable the Bureau to effectively
enforce the anti-gambling statutes
i+ Tatvsmeuvs wie can proauce accurate and authentic data regarding the
extent of graft and corruption in each sector of the nation
e. Informants who can furnish information which will enable the Bureau
to prosecute the hood@lum hierarchy

2. The development of informants who can provide information of this caliber
is mandatory to insure the Bureau meets its commitments.

3. This program cells for the selection of targets for development. The
selection should be based upon a combination of a particular hoodlumts
qualifications by virtue of his position in the organized hoodlum element
and upon circumstances indicating his possible susceptibility to development.
To insure maximum security for an individual under development, he should
be assigned a cymbol number immediately upon being designated for attention.
The symbol number for these individuals should be followed by the suffix
PC to insure that they will be distinguished’ from regular criminal
informant, The Bureau should be promptly advised whenever an individual
is added or deleted from your program.

4, When requesting authority to add a target, include sufficient data in

C a(UACBlcommunicetion to indicate(that]the individual is a logical

t choice for inclusion in your program. (For purposes of security, this
initial communication should always be transmitted by secure teletype and

shouldJinclude such data regarding the proposed target as a complete

description,[a summary of his arrest record, and information indicating

that[he has Jaccess to significant information[concerning Jtop level

racket figures. Insure that the program is not diluted by requesting

C authority to add targets who[{should Imore appropriately be considered PCIs.

5. A penetrative investigation of each individual selected as a target
should be conducted prior to any approach of the individual. After
completion of the penetrative investigation, request the Bureau to approve
the interview of the target. The letter requesting such authority should
set forth the approach to be utilized in the interview. A full exploi~
tation must be made of any circumstances which place a target in a

Dear Sir:.

‘ In connection with expenditures of a confidential nature
for which reimbursement is claimed by blue slip, youare advised that
such expenditures must be limited strictly to investigative cases
of major importance wherein monies may be paid to confidential

J informants or for confidential purposes, reimburserent for which

: could not be claimed by regular personal service voucher without-

jeopardizing the successful completion of the investigation,

ae You are, therefore, advised that it will not be neces~
sary to continue the retention of cogies of confidential blue
‘slips in the varicus field division files. The present field
blue slip files should be forwarded lo the Washington head~
quarters of the Bureau under personal and confidential cover,

Dear Sirs

3 It has been noted in connection with confidential
disbursements being made by special agents for which rein

bursenent is claimed by blue slip thet in many instmces the
receipt is executed in the name of an agent or person other

_ than the agent claiming reimbursement,

It is desired that whenever possible the receipt
be made in the name of the agent who pays the bill and who
will claim reimbursement. It is understocd. that in all
instances this will not ve practical, for instance, if Agent
Smith makes arrangexents for the rental of an apartment for
surveillance purposes and he is later transferred from thi
assignment the bill ordinarily will be ccntinued in his name and
paid by another agent, In instances such as this the agent
who vays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per-
.sonally paid same and that he is claiming reimbursement there-
for, If the receipt is made out in the name of an alias
bea: cd ty the agent this fact should

rey
blue slip.

In those instances waere, payment is made to an .
informant for services rendered over a definite period the
date of the beginning ard ending of the period shoukd be
indicated on the blue slip. :

This matter should be brought to the attention of
all special agents under your supervision and the blue slips
stibmitted should be carefully checked by you to see that they
conform with the ahove instructions, Close attention to this
matter will obviate the necessity for returning expense accounts
for correction, :

CUSE

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present tine
,of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for v
continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential
fund and the submission oi monthly reports in connection therewita,

You are aware, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-
lations it is absolutely essential that an appropriate statement
sudmitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the
confidential fund in each field office, including therein iis status
with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursenents which
have been made during the current accounting period.

‘any of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-
mit such rconthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it
is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's
records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurate
record upon the vasis of which the accountability of each Special
Agent in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at |
the Bureau over a period of time reflects an increasing number of pay- ~
ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-
ants. The sa is true of "deposits" with electric light companies
and other ut ties, which deposits usually range in amounts fron $10
to $20. At the time the monthly-statement is submitted by the field
office involved, such statements invariably fail to indicates that the
expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts
of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-
stances they are improperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

NW 55320 Docld:32989712 Page 61
:


7 ry sate 2- + i
an accurate accounting on the part of the Bureau in respect thereto.

For.your guidance in the preparation of future monthly
reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being
enclosed nerewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly
the manner in which discursements, advances, refunds; or purchases
are to be listed. All subsequent monthly statements prepared by
your office should be submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Special Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the
expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue
slips. For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-
odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-
ceints therefor having been secured. it is believed that such
items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of
a money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-
ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren=
dered by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental
of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other
items of a related nature where a receipt could. reasonably be secured,

Although the Bureau is necessarily aware of the fact that
receivts cannot be secured in each end every instance, cue to exi-
gencies peculiar to certain types cf investigative activities
nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for
confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise
practicable to do so. Hereafter, confidential items will be sus-
pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-
volved are- properly supported by the necessary receipts.

_ Likewise, the Bureau has noted-with considerable concern
increased purchases in the form of furniture, bedding, clothing, and
related items utilized in the conduct -of various plants and other |
confidential investigative activities. This is ial particular sig-
nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-
sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable re are not being taken
up properly on the field office inventories. Accordingly, it is
desired that you forward to the Bureau in the near future a detailed
report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased
and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the Bureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be .
maintained simultaneously by each of the respective field offices
co having control, custody, or possession of such equipment. With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate non-expendable receiving slips. Such slips should indi-

cate that the item was purchased through the submission of blue

slips. The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted

and suspensions from the vouchers will be made in those instances

where field offices rail to submit non-expendable receiving slips.- , - cere

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein
your ij diate personal attention and supervision: It is expected
that in the future there will be strict compliance with the foré-
going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-
cies may be logically concluded th a minimum of delay.

an expenditure was made for the purpose of securing information relating to
matters under the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau, it not being pos-

sible to secure such information in any other manner.

In making such expend itures, all Special Agents must bear in mind

The Bureau is desirous at ithe present time of bringing to your attention
the absolute necessity for the careful handling of expenditures from the Con-

the evbmissicn of moathly ruports dn cottwotion thesevlth.

You are aware that under existing Bureau regulations it is absolutely
essential that an appropriate statement be submitted at the end of each month
reflecting the condition of the Confidentiel Fund in each field office, including
therein its status with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursement ts
which have been made during the current Eivaureckans ng period.

Many of the field offices have in ‘the past failed to submit such
nontkiy steterients promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly
difficult to properly audit the Bureau's records in connection therewith. As
set out in SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, e11 Confidential Fund rerorts
should be received at the Bureau no later than the 20th of the following manth.

* For your guidence in the preparation of future monthly reports concern- _
ing Confidential Fund expenditures. there is enclosed a sample form which outlines
briefly the proper method of prev: the report. In addition, there is enclosed
a sample form which outlines the metnod which should be used to summarize the ~

> payments to informants and confidential sources. In this regard your attention

is directed to Section (A), SAC Letter No. 23, dated April +, 1950, which is
revised in that the Atomic Energy informants should be deleted from the report.
The susmary should now reflect payments to Criminal and National Defense
Confidential Sources.

nGegHEEEes It has o. noted that in a great nuxbeMJF instances Special Agents
have not been submitting receipts to justify the exrerditures for which re-
imbursements are being clained through blue slips. The Eureau is awere of the
fact thet receipts cannot be secured in each end every instance, due to
exigencies peculiar to certain types of activities, nevertheless, receipts
should be obtained wherever possible.

In connection with the preparation of the blue slips it has been
noted that some are being prerared too much in detail. In those instances. where
the payment is made to en authorized reguler paid informant, the following
information is sufficient to support the claim:

1. Amount of payment
2, Name and symbol number of informant
- 3. Case i
4, Date of authorization letter or teletype
5. Period of payment

A semple form reflecting the proper method for preparing a blue slip
is attached, Ei ones :

~ he Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re-

H claiming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the voucher thet the item wes
suspended from a previous voucher, It is pointed out that no reference should
be made to the previous youcker nor should the Agent state that the item was
suspended unless he forwards the original Stetement of Difference with the
youcher,

Your attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a
limited amount of funds availeble to operate the Confidential Funds of the
field divisions, therefore, you should wake every effort to operate on your
present fund. It is pointed out that a more frequent submission of Confidential
Fund vouchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the fund.

In the future when an office desires to esteblish a Confidential
Fund, it will be necessary that the office furnish the Bureau full and complete
justification. : 7

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your
immediate personal attention and supervision.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND
ACCOUNTING FRCCEDURES -
FBI FOCRH BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures
presently being followed by the various field divisicns which were
forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,
and from a review of the suggesticns submitted along with these
reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling
the operations of the Confidential Funds maintained by the various
field divisions should be established. :

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accounting
procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining
- a Confidential Fund:

: 1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Cne shall be
used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of
the fund authorized for the field division, Transactions that
wuld affect vis Tuna are:

a, Temporary or permanent increases in the fund,

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an
informant for which the office has been reimbursed by
the Bureau.

at ¢e. Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases
and refunds received from the informants in cases
similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balence
of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.
This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount to
be accounted for.

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be S
futiiizea to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total
fund, This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample
(Exhibit Number Two), which reflects examples of various transactions
which will affect the Fund. This ledger should be retained indefi-
nitely and should be used as the basis for the preparation of the waa

Ts \ a couanadapedsiWodawit seveesee*eummsetazanatatssiassticsesaiia 7 ECE eerseenl



_monthly report. All columns should be ruled off at the end of the
calendar month and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number
One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements. The debit
side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from
the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau. All payments made
to criminal informants and sources should be reflected in the
column captioned "Criminal; all payments to security infcrmants
or sources snould te reflected in the column captioned "Security;”
and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either
of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone
companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box rental, etc.,
should be reflected in thé column captioned "Miscellaneous," The
credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds
from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous
payment. was of a criminal, security. or miscellaneous nature,

-Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;

i checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases
should be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas any
refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which
must be returned to the Bureau because the vayment has already
been vouchered, should be reflected in the "Refunds" column, Like-

wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be
recorded here, (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.)

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every
entry in the Cash Disbursements cclumn, there should be a corre-
sponding entry in one of the debit columns, i.e., in either the
Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to
Bureau column, Likewise, for every entry in the Gash Receipts
column, there should be a corresponding entry in’one of the credit

| columns, i.e., in either the Refunds of Payments column or in the
| Receipts from Bureau column,

7 — It is to be further noted that the totals-of Column

+ Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "Sum-
mary of Payments to Informants" in connection with the monthly
report. The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by
subtracting the total of the credit side of Column One from the
total of the debit side of this column.

-3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each
paid informant and for each paid confidential sources. - This section
of the ledger should be divided into three parts; namely, Criminal,
Security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a
separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid
criminal confidential source, The Security section should reflect

ae e e
a separate page for each paid security informant and each paid
confidential source, Under the Miscellaneous section, pages
should be set up fer rental of space for plants or surveillances,
regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the Confidential
Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regular

‘basis. Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-~
rants, rental of safe deposit boxes, etc., may be included on 4
single page as the expenditures ccme up. A sample cf an informant
page is attached (Exhibit Number Three), It is to be noted that
this page reflects the following information:

the date of authorization
the authorization

period covered by payment
Gate of payment

amount of payment

-02007R

In connection with the date of authorization, you are
instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter
to the field division in cases where authorization is made by
Bureau letter and the date of the incoming letter when authorization
is made by stamping "approved" on a tickler copy of a letter
received from the field division requesting authority,

Before making any disbursements from the Confidential
Fund to an informant the anthorizat ch te cheekcd te be
sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and that the
period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing
authorization, These authorizations should te posted in the
\- ledger at the time they are received frem the Bureau. In connection

“ with SAC authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

is being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's
file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that
-date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954;

form FD-228 shculd be removed from your’form book and your supply

destroyed,

4, After a careful review of the many suggestions received

in response tc SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-
1 ing funds from the Confidential Fund has been designed, a copy of

which is attached, You may print a supply of this fcrm for use in

your office, -FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have

been appreved for your office. A copy of FD-235 is to be placed in

the FBI Form Book. This form should be prepared in duplicate by

the Agent requesting the funds, and after approval by the Agent

Supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the SAC for his approval

‘NW 55320 DocId:32989712 Page 86



NW 55320 Docld:32989712 Page 87

before any disbursement is made from the Confidential Fund, After
approval of the form by the SAC and after the employee handling
the disbursements frcem the fund has carefully verified that the
payment is in accordance with existing authority, one copy of the

“form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file which should be
divided inte two sections; namely, an unvouchered file ard a
vouchered file. These forms can be used by the employee responsible
for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue
slips for submission so the Bureau. Of ccurse, these blue slips
should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the
informant is obtained from the Agent making the payment, and in
those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the
Agent making the payment. At the time the voucher is prepared, those
forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be
attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been
prepared and retained in the accountsS receivable file until reim-~
bursement is made by the Bureau, At the time reimbursement is
received, the voucher should be removed together with the attach-
ments and a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement
was received from the Bureau, The Request for Funds forms attached
to the voucher may then be destroyed. In the event an item has
been suspended from the voucher and returned to the field office,
it would be necessary to remove the Request for Funds form from

he v mor on which thc blue oliv wes requesved and revurned to
the unvouchered file until such time as it is resubmitted or it is
determined it will not be resubmitted.

5. Monthly Report. As you are aware, the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared
and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month following
the period during ch the expenditures were made. These reports
should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

. the present form for this report have been suggested and after a

veview of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the A
reports should be prepared in accordancé with the attached example
(Exhibit Number Five). The monthly repcrt submitted to the Bureau
should be prepared under the direct supervisicn of the Special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly
designated Field Supervisor, Tne fund should be audited once-each
six months, on June 30 and December 31, This audit shall be
personally performed by a Special Agent Accountant. The report of
this audit shall be forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of -
duly and the twentieth day of January. in those instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Insvector from the Training
and Inspection Division during a, regular inspection, the next

‘regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the Field Division.

6/9/54

-4.



With regard to the summary of expenditures section of

the Confidential Report, it is desired to illustrate the following
points; :

a. All transactions enrtne the calendar :
month should be shown, 7 ‘i

b. All items should be listed in order by
date and by check number,

e,. -The explanation should reflect the
_ name and symbol number of the informant as
well as the period covered by the payment and
7 “in case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief
statement to deseribe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the
total amount of the fund to be accounted for
must be fully explained in a cover memoran~
dum. An example of such a transaction would
be a refund received from an informant for
payment which had already been reimbursed by
the Bureau. Any such refund, if not already
forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted
with the report,

In ccnnecticn with the cummary of payments to infeorments,
you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed
separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-
tion. This breakdown should include such payments as post office
box rental, telephone service, rental of space for Plants, bank
charges, rasteurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for
prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informant
or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or
expenses incurred by them should be included under miscellaneous
expenditures.

6. Peete of Blue Slips, As was pointed: out here-
tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds
form with the exception that the date of actual payment. toithe
informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be
obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt
obtained from the informant. A blue slip should be prepared at

.Such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been

received from the Agent making the payment. t

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but
should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make
@ proper review of the expenditures, Samples are attached
reflecting payments made to informants under Bureau authority

WW 55320 DociId:32989712 Page 86



"(Exhibit Number six), SAC atithority (Exhibit Number Seven), and
miscellaneous expenditures (Exhibit Number Eight). These samples
are general but should be used as a guide for preraring all blue
slips. In addition to the attached samples, it is desired that

the following be kept in mind in connection with the preparation
of blue slips:

a. One blue slip should be used for each
payment. It is not desired to have numerous
payments listed on a single blue slip in view
of the possibility of error which would result
in the necessity of suspending the entire biue

7 slip; whereas if only one payment were listed
: on the blue slip, it would be possible to re-
turn only the one item and the remaining items

could be processed for payment.s «3

b. The authority must be clearly reflected
‘on the blue slip. When authority is based on
the letter from the Bureau, actual date of the
Bureau letter shall be used as the date of the
: : authorization, Then the field office, by letter,
7 requests authorization and receives notice that
authorization has been granted in the form of a
copy of the field office letter returned by bine
Turcau with the Bureau approval stamped
the date of the authorization in this instance
shall be the actual date of the field office let-
ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

ec, The actual period of time covered by the

payment to the informant must be reflected in the
‘body of the blue slip, For example, see "Period"

—reflected in body of Exhibit Number Six. It is
also essential that the period covered be carefully
compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent
exceeding the Bureau authorization, bcth by time
and amount. Receipts should be obtained whenever
possible. In instances where they are not obtained
either because of the refusal of the informant to
execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain
one, the appropriate netation should be reflected
on the blue slip.

ad.” FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the
Agent reflecting receipt of money from the SAC is
only to be used when ‘the receipt signed by the
informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

e. In all instances where the receipt signed
by the informant reflects payment was made to him
by the Special Agent in Charge, reimbursement must
be claimed cn a voucher of the Special Agent in _
Charge. If the receipt reflects payment was madé
to the informant by the Assistant Special Agent in
Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed on a
voucher of the Assistant Special Agent in Charge.

In instances where the receipt reflects that payment
was made to the informant by someone other than the
Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Special Agent
in Charge or where there is no payor designated, the
blue slip may be submitted for payment on the
voucher of either the Special Asent in Charge

or the Assistant Special Agent in Charge. When

the receipt reflects that payment was made by a
person other than the one claiming reimbursement,
Form FD-221 must be executed and attached to the ~

-blue slip, It is advisable to nave the inform-

ant's: receipts’ executed in the name of the
employee actually making payment or in blank in
order that the Special Agent in Charge or the
Assistant Special Agent in Charge may claim
reimbursement.

Ff. The Bine slin shold not reflenh the
number of the check issued and no reference
should be made on the blue slip to the inform-
ant's: field file number,

ge. All blue slips submitted on the monthly
expense vouchers of Special Agents must bear the
approval of the Special Agent in Charge; however,
the Special Agent in Charge may delegate authority
to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or an
approved field office supervisor to sign his name
as approving official fcllowed by the initials of
the Assistant Special Agent in’ Charge or the
supervisor, .

h. Receipts obtained by personnel which
reflect payments to informants and sources should
reflect the ACTUAL DATS payment is made to the
informant or source, The receipt should in no 7 .
instance reflect any other date. The Receipt
should also show the EXACT AMCUNT paid to the
informant or source, ‘and every Special Agent sub-
mitting receipts should thoroughly understand

this procedure,

i. All vouchers containing blue slips must
be forwarded to the Bureau addressed to Assistant
Directcr, Administrative Division, Attenticn:
Voucher Unit. They must be sent via‘ registered
mail, return receipt requested and cannot be
intermingled with other mail. Confidential Fund
monthly reports should also be submitted in this
manner to the Bureau.

: 1. Miscellaneous, It is desired to bring the following
miscellaneous items to your attention:

. a. When submitting blue slips covering
payments to informants from another field
division, the informant should be identified
on the blue siip by indicating his name, symbol
number and field division.

: b. The words Confidential Fund should never
be fentioned on a blue slip. When claiming for
bank charges, the blue slip should reflect pay-
ment to an official of the bank by name for serv-
ices rendered. Bee a

7 ec. Payments under the authorization of the
SAC are Limitcd to $200.00 te syiwiidl lurorwmanits
and sources; and to $100.00 to security informants
and sources, This maximum is considered as all
payments made to an individual regardless of the
length of time between payments. Once an inform-
ant has been paid under Bureau authority, pay-
ments cannot be made under the authority of the
“SAC even in instances where the informant has been

discontinued as a regularly paid informant.

ad. The ledger page’ that is used in Exhibits
One, Two and Three is size 9°1/4 X 11 7/8 inches;
and for Exhibits Number Cne and Three, four-column
paper is used, and eight-column paper for Exhibit
Number Two, The type of binder that should be

! expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing Manual
provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for
every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility
of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that fuli value
is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of Seat
of Government employees to be judicious in authorizing expenditures .

Caer office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

: slips to determine the propriety of each expenditure and will trace
‘ through the files information received and results obtained,

7 following the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through
with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that
in the event an expenditure is encountered which -is not proper

the employees involved will reimburse the Government,

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -
ACCOUNTING PRCCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which
set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation or
the Confidential Fund,

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which it
is felt will eliminate scme dunlication of work in ccnnection
with the establishment. of these accounting procedures. The sug-
gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining
whether payments to infermants on SAC authority are in excess
of the $200,CO amount for criminal informants and the $100.60
amount for security informants, It was sugsested that the in-
formants! files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,
1954, be entered on the informants! individual ledger pages.
This would apply only to payments made under SAC authority.

. It is felt that this suggestion will save considerable
time and work in the field. and.vcu are accordinglv instructed
to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting
procedure,

Very truly. yours,

BLUE SLIPS

In the preparation of future blue slips, the
following instructions should be adhered to:

The blue slips should show the correct name of
the individual being’ paid. Any difference between this and
the name used by the informant in signing a receipt for
payment must be explained on the blue slip. When a name
other than the individual's full correct name is:used in
Anitial development as an informant, his full correct name
should be used on the blue slip as soon as it is known,
together with references to the previous names used in
eontacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure is necessary fo enehjle the
Bureau fo nvororly cuutsui payments and to make sure that
all payments to one individual are consolidated. It has
been noted in some instances that blue slips are submitted
showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are
submitted showing the individual's middle name as a last

“mame. This is especially true in connection with Spanish

names. This practice leads to the possibility of carrying
a separate account of payments under each name.

Make sure that the necessary employees of your
office are aware of this and the need for consistency.

In addition,where an informant or individual
known to have been formerly contacted by another division
is paid by your division, the blue slip claiming reimburse-
ment should refer to the fact that he is formerly from the
other division, This 13 necessary to insure that the
Bureau's accounts of payments are properly credited for
payments made,

The Bureau has noted that in many instances the
field 1s not following instructions concerning the forward-
img o£ vouchers containing confidential items (blue slips)
to the Bureau. The Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II,

vouchers containing confidential blue slips must be sent
by Registered *ail, Return Receipt Requested, the inner
envelope addressed to the Assistant Director, Administrative
Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Attention Voucner
Unit. Monthly reports of confidential expenditures must be
handled in the same manner. The envelope should not be

ct marked Personal and Confidential. You should bring this
matter to the attention of all employees responsible for
handling the mailing of these items.

MONTHLY REPORTS OF CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES

In examining the above-captioned reports, the

Bureau has noted that- the field is not being consistent
in the way the expenditures are summarized on the last

. page. Some reports include payments made to PCIs or PSIs
with those to "Sources." Payments to PCIs or PSIs should

. be included with "“Informants" and not with "Sources." Only
those payments made to Confidential Sources, Panel Sources,
and Sources of Information should be .included under
Sources" in che summary, rake sure tnau tne persons
responsible for the preparation and review of the report

are aware of the above.

(D) UTILIZATION OF FORM FD-221a - INFORMANT MATTERS --
Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants
(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to
give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as
follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize
"the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No
change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,
FD-221 and informant receipts. The matter concerning security for
all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose
’ of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security.

PROVIDENCE QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time
,of ag@in bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the
continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential
fund and the susmission of monthly reports in connection therewith.

You are aware, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-
lations it is absolutely essential that an appropriate statement be
submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the
confidential fund in each field office, including therein its status
with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements which
have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-
mit such monthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it
is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit vhe Bureau's
records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurate
record woon the basis of which the accountability of each Special
Agent in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at
the Bureau over a period of time reflects an increasing number of pay-
ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-
ants. The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies
and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10
to $20. At the time the monthly-statement is submitted by the field
office involved, such statements invariably fail to in@icate that the
expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts
of which are to te subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-
stances -they are inproperly recorded in such a manner as to precluds



NW 55320

res i

For.your guidance in the preparation of future monthly
reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being
enclosed nerewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly

the manner in which disbursements, advances, refunds; or purchases
are to be listed. All subsequent monthly statements prepared by
your office should be submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in 2 great number of cases 7
Special agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the
expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue
slips. For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-
odicals suvscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-
ceipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such
items, wherever practicable, should be paid for py the issuance of
a money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-
ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren+
dered by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental
of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other
items of a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the Bureau is necessarily aware of the fact that
receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-
gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,
nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for
confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise
practicable to do so. Hereafter, confidential items will be sus-
pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-
volved are- properly supported by the necessary receipts.

_ Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern
increased purchases in the form of furniture, bedding, clothing, and
related items utilized in the conduct -of various plants and other
confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-
nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-
sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken
up properly on the field office inventories. Accordingly, it is
desired that you forward to the Bureau in the near future a detailed
report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased
and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried
on the Bureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be
maintained simultaneously by each of the respective field offices
having control, custody, or possession of such equipzent. With
reference to future purchasee of this kind, the field offices will
be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of
appropriate non-expendable receiving slips. Such slips should indi-
cate that the item was purchased through the submission of blue
slips. The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted
and suspensions from the vouchers will be made in those instances
where field offices fail to submit non-expendabdle receiving-slips. -

Docld:32989712 Page 135



Accordingly, desired that the non-expe@ ceceiving slips |

oo ‘ - covering pur es of furniture, bedding, and“¥ther equipment by
eet blue slips, be attached to the voucher when it is submitted for
payment.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein
‘your immediate personal attention and supervision: It is expected
that in the future there will be strict compliance with the foré-
going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

7 . cies may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

exigencies peculiar to certain tynes of activities, never theless, receipts
should be obtained wherever possible. .

In connection with the preparetion of the blue slips it hes been
noted that some are being prerered too much in dete In those instances. where
the payment is rede to an authorized reguler vaid informant, the following
inforration is sufficient to support the claim:

1. Amount of payment
2. WNeme and symbol number of inforzant
- 3. Case
Date of authorization letter or teletype
5. Period of payment

A semple form reflect ing the proper method for vreparing a blue slip
is attached. on .
i a “The Bureau has also noted in many instences that Agents, when re-

t claiming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the voucher that the item was
suspended from a previous voucher. It is pointed out that no reference should
De made to the previous voucher nor should the Agent state that the item was
suspended unless he forwards the original Stetement of Difference with the
voucher,

: Your attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a

: : limited amount of funds available to operate the Confidential Funds of the

i field divisions, therefore, you should make every effort to operate on your

i present fund. It is pointed out that a more frequent submission of Confidential
Fund vouchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the fund,

In the future when an office desires to establish a Confidential
Fund, it will be necessary that _ office furnish the Bureau full end complete
justification,

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your
immediate personal attention and supervision.

Very truly yours ,

John Edgar Hoover

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND
ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES -
FBI FCRi BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures
presently being followed by the various field divisicns which were
forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,
and from a review cf the suggestions submitted along with these
reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling
the operations of the Confidential Funds maintained by suing various
field divisions should be established,

. Effective July 1, 1954, the following eoeoonting
procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining
a Confidential Fund: i

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Cne shall be
used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of
the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that
wUuid aliecu ois Tuna are:

a, Temporary or permanent increases in the fund,

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an
informant for which the office has been reimbursed by
the Bureau, :

e. Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases
“and refunds received from the informants in cases
similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balance
of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division,
This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount to
be accounted for,

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be
lutiiizea to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total
fund. This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample
(Exhibit RKumber Two), which reflects examples of various transactions
which will affect the Fund. This ledger should be retained indefi- ;
nitely and should be used as the basis for the preparation of. the_

|

NW 55320 DocId:32989712 Page 157



_monthly report. All columns shculd be ruled off at the end of the
calendar month and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number
One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements. The debit
side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from
the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau, All payments made
to criminal informants and sources should be reflected in the
column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security infcrmants
or sources snculd te reflected in the column captioned "Security;"
and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either
of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone
companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box: rental, etc.,
should be reflected in the column captioned "Miscellaneous," The
credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds
from payments previcusly made regardless of whether the previous
payment. was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous nature,

-Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;
checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases
should be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas any
refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which -
must be returned to the Bureau because the payment has already
been vouchered, should be reflected in the "Refunds" column, Like-
wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be
recorded here, (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.)

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every
entry in the Cash Disbursements cclumn, there should be a corre-
sponding entry in one of the debit columns, i.e., in either the
Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to
Bureau column. Likewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts
column, there should be a corresponding entry in‘one of the credit
columns, i.e., in either the Refunds of Payments column or in the
Receipts from Bureau column.

— It is to be further noted that the totals of Column
Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "Sum-
mary of Payments to Informants" in connection with the monthly
report. The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by
subtracting the total of the credit side of Column One from the
total of the debit side of this column,

3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each
paid informant and for each paid confidential sources. This section
of the ledger should be divided into three parts; namely, Criminal,
Security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a
separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid
eriminal confidential source. The Security section should reflect

a separate page for each paid security informant and each paid:
confidential source. Under the Miscellaneous secticn, pages

should be set up for rental of space for plants or surveillances,
regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the Confidential
Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regular

‘basis. Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-

rants, rental of safe deposit boxes, etc., may be included ona
single page as the expenditures ccme up. A sample cf an informant
page is attached (Exhibit Number Three). It is to be noted that
this page reflects the following information:

.» the date, of authorization
.» the authorization

« period covered by payment
. Gate of payment

« amount of payment

.0Re007R

In connection with the date of authorization, you are
instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter
to the field division in cases where authorizaticn is made by
Bureau letter and the date of the incoming letter when authorization
is made by stamping "approved" on a tickler copy of a letter
received from the field division requesting authority,

7 Before making any disbursements from the Confidential
Fund to an informant, the authorization should be cheekecd to be

sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and that the
period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing
authorization, These authorizations should be posted in the

ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau. In connection
with SAC authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment
is being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's
file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

‘date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. cn July 1, 1954;

form FD-228 shculd be removed from your’form book and your supply
destroyed,

4, After a careful review of the many suggestions received
in response to SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-
ing funds from the Confidential Fund has been designed, a copy of
which is attached, Yeu may print a supply of this form fcr use in
your office, -FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have
been approved for your office. 4 copy of FD-235 is to be placed in
the FBI Form Book. This form should be prepared in duplicate by
the Agent requesting the funds, and after approval by the Agent
Supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the SAC for his approval

6/9/54
NO NUMBER i
SAC LETTER NO, 54-G -3-

soe ee ee

‘NW 55320 DoclId:32989712 Page 159 ©



before any disbursement is made from the Confidential Fund. After
approval of the form by the Sic and after the employee handling
the disbursements frem the fund has carefully verified that the
payment is in accordance with existing authority, one copy of the
‘form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second
copy retained in an eccounts receivable file which should be
divided into two sections; namely, an unvouchered file ard a
vouchered file. ‘These forms can be used by the employee responsible
for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue
Slips for submission to the Bureau. Of ccurse, these blue slips
should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the
informant is obtained from the Agent making the payment, and in
those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the
Agent making the payment. At the time the voucher is prepared, those
forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be
attached to the tickler copy of that vcucher after it has been
- prepared and retained in the accountS receivable file until reim-~
bursement is made by the Bureau. At the time reimbursement is
received, the voucher shculd be removed together with the attach~-
ments and a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement
was received from the Bureau, The Reauest for Funds forms attached
to the voucher may then be destroyed. In the event an item has
been suspended from the voucher and returned to the Pield office,
it would be necessary to remove the Request for Funds form from
the voucher on which the blac oliv wes reydested and returned to
the unvouchered file until such time as it is resubmitted or it is
determined it will not be resubmitted,

5. Monthly Report. As you are aware, the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared
and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month following
the period during wnich the expenditures were mede. These reports
should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

7 . the present form for this report have been suggested and after a

i review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the
reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example
(Exhibit Number Five), The monthly report submitted to the Bureau
should be prepared under the direct supervisicn of the Special
Agent in Cha , Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly
Gesignated Fleld Supervisor. Tne fund should be audited once-each
six months, on June 30 and December 31, This audit shall be
personally performed by a Special Agent Accountant. The report of
this audit shall te forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of -
July and the twentieth day of January. In those instances where
the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training
and Inspection Division during a, regular inspection, the next

> regular six months! audit shall ke omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the Field Division. .

With regard to the summary of expenditures section of

the Confidential Report, it is desired to illustrate the following
points;

a. All transactions during the yeatenees
month should be shown,

b. All items should be listed in order by
date and by check number.

¢. ‘The explanation should reflect the
name and symbol number of the informant as
well as the period covered by the payment and
in case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief
statement to describe the expenditure,

d. Any transaction that affects the
total amount of the fund to be accounted for
must be fully explained in a cover memoran-~
dum. An example of such a transaction would
be a refund received from an informant for
payment which had already been reimbursed by
the Bureau, Any such refund, if not already
forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted
with the report.

mnesticn with tha sz

you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed
separately frcm payments made to informants or sources of informa-
tion, This breakdown should include such payments as post office
box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank
charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for
prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants
or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or
expenses incurred by them Should be included under miscellaneous
expenditures.

In co ary of phrmente to infnomente

6. Peers of Blue Slips. As was pointed: out here-
tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds
form with the exception that the date of actual payment-toithe
informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be
obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt
obtained from the informant. A blue slip should be prepared at

.such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been

received from the Agent making the payment. :

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but
should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make
@ proper review of the expenditures, Samples are attached
reflecting payments made to informants under Bureau authority

SAC LETTER NO, oA Eid .

NW 55320 Docld:32989712 Page 161



(Exhibit Number six ), SAG authority (Exhibit number Seven), and
miscellaneous expenditures (Exhibit Number Eight). These samples
are general but should be used as a guide for preparing all blue
slips. In addition to the attached samples, it is desired that

the following be kept in mind in connection with the preparation
of blue slips:

a. One blue slip should be used for each
payment. It is not desired to have numerous
payments listed on a single blue slip in view
of the possibility of error which would result
in the necessity of suspending the entire blue

a slip; whereas if only one payment were listed
: on the blue slip, it would be possible to re-
turn only the one item and the remaining items
could be processed for payment,» «>

b. The authority must be clearly reflected

‘on the blue slip. When authority is based on

the letter from the Bureau, actual date cf the

Bureau letter shall be used as the date of the

: : authorization. Then the field office, by letter,

; requests authorization and receives notice that

: authorization has been granted in the form of a
copy oe _ field office letter returned by the
Burcat the Burcau appreval stamped thercon,
the date of the authorization in this instance
shall be the actual date of the field office let-~
ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

ce. The actual period of time covered by the
payment to the informant must be reflected in the
‘body of the blue slip. For example, see "Period"
reflected in body of Exhibit Number Six. It is
also essential that the period covered be carefully
compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent
exceeding the Bureau authorization, beth by time
and amount, Receipts should be obtained whenever
possible. In instances where they are not obtained
either because of the refusal of the informant to
execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain
one, the appropriate notation sheuld be reflected
ci on the blue slip.

d.° FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the
Agent reflecting receipt of money from the SAC is
only to be used when ‘the receipt signed by the
informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

e, In all instances where the receipt signed
by the informant reflects payment was made to him
by the Special Agent in Charge, reimbursement must
be claimed on a voucher of the Special Agent in |
Charge. If the receipt reflects payment was made
to the informant by the Assistant Special Agent in
Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed on a
voucher of the Assistant Srecial Agent in Charge.

In instances where the receipt reflects that payment
was made to the informant by someone other than the
Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Special Agent
in Charge or where there is no payor designated, the
blue slip may be submitted for payment on the
voucher of either the Special Agent in Charge

or the Assistant Special Agent in Charge. When

the receipt reflects that payment was made by a
person other than the cone claiming reimbursement,
Form FD-221 must be executed and attached to the ~

-blue slip. It is advisable to have the inforn-

ant's: receipts’exécuted in the name of the
employee actually making payment or in blank in
order that the Special Agent in Charge or the
Assistant Special Agent in Charge may claim
reimbursement.

fF. The Blve slin.shavld not reflent the
number of the check issued and no reference
should be made on the blue slip to the inform-
ant's- field file number,

&. All blue slips submitted on the monthly
expense vouchers of Special Agents must bear the
approval of the Special nt in Charge; however,
the Special Agent inc may delegate authority
to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or an
approved field office supervisor to sign his name
as approving official fcllowed by the initials of
the Assistant Special Agent in’ Charge or the
supervisor, .

h. Receipts obtained by personnel which
reflect payments to informants and sources should
reflect the ACTUAL DATS ment is made to the
informant or source, The receipt should in no i .
instance reflect any other date. The Receipt
should also show the EXACT AMCUNT paid to the
informant or source, ‘and every Special Agent sub-~
mitting receipts should thoroughly understand
this .procedure,

SAC LETTER NO, 54~G

NW 55320 DocId:32989712 Page 163


1. All vouchers containing blue slips must
be forwarded to the Bureau addressed to Assistant
Directcr, Administrative Division, Attention:
Voucher Unit. They must ‘be sent via'registered
mail, return receipt requested and cannot be
intermingled with other mail. Confidential Fund
monthly reports should also be submitted in this
manner to the Bureau.

7. Miscellaneous, It is desired to bring the following
miscellaneous items to your attention:

. a, When submitting blue slips ‘covering
payments to informants from another field
Givision, the informant should be identified
on the blue siip by indicating his name, symbol
number and field division.

b. The words Confidential Fund should never
“pe mentioned on a blue Slip. When claiming for
bank charges, the blue slip should reflect pay-
ment to an official of the bank by name for serv-
ices rendered,

ec, Payments under the authorization of the
SAC are limitsd te $200.00 to or L duPoimaiits
and sources; and to $100.00 to security informants
and sources, This maximum is considered as all
pan payments made to an individual regardless of the
length of time between payments. Once an inform-
ant has been paid under Bureau authority, pay-
ments cannot be made under the authority of the
“SAC even in instances where the informant has been
discontinued as a regularly | paid informant.

: a. The ledger page’ that is used in Exhibits

27 One, Two and Three is sige 9'1/4 X 11 7/8 inches;
and for Exhibits Number Cne and Three, fqur-column
paper is used, and eight~column paper for Exhibit
Number Two, The type of binder that should be

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES -- I want to draw to your attention
the absolute importance of making certain that any co’ dential
expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing Manual
provisions and thet the Bureau receives appropriate value for
every dollar expended, Although it is the personal responsibility
of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of Seat

of Government employees to be judicious in authorizing expenditures
ta he meade ong te

practios preper coon.

For your information, Inspectors will, in each field
office inspection, review in the neighberhood of one hundred blue
slips to determine the propriety of each expenditure and will trace

i through the files information received and results obtained,
: following the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it t zr
with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that
in the event an expenditure is encountered which -is not proper
the employees involved will reimburse the Government.

Very truly yours,
John Edgar Hoover

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND ~
ACCOUNTING PRCCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which
set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of
the Confidential Fund. :

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which it
is felt will eliminate scme duplication of work in connection
with the establishment. of these acccunting procedures. The sug-
gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining
whether payments to infcermants on SAC authority are in excess

of the $200,CO amount’ for criminal informants and the $100.00
amount for security informants, It was sugsested that the in-
formants! files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,
1954, be entered on the informants! individual ledger pages,

This would apply only to payments made under SAC authority.

It is felt that this suggestion will save considerable
time and work in the field, and .vcu are accordinslv instructed
to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting
procedure,

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

BLUE SLIPS
; In the preparation of future blue slips, the
- following instructions should be adhered to:

The blue slips should show the correct name of

the individual being’ paid. Any difference between this and
7 the name used by the informant in signing a receipt for
: payment must be explained on the blue slip. When a name
other than the individual's full correct name is used in
initial development as an informant, his full correct name
should be used on the blue slip as soon as it is known,
together with references to the previous names used in
contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure is necessary to enshie the
Bureav to properly ctuirol payments and to make sure that
a@ll payments to one individual are consolidated. It has
been noted in some instances that blue slips are submitted
showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are
submitted showing the individual's middle name as a last
“name, This is especially true in connection with Spanish
names, This practice leads to the possibility of carrying
@ separate account of payments under each name.

Make sure that the necessary employees of your
office are aware of this and the need for consistency,

In addition,where an informant or individual
Imown to have been formerly contacted by another division
is paid by your division, the blue slip claiming reimburse-
ment should refer to the fact that he is formerly from the
“other division, This is necessary to insure that the
Bureau's accounts of payments are properly credited for
payments made.

The Bureau has noted that in many instances the
- field is not following instructions concerning the forward-
: hg o£ vouchers containing confidential items (blue slips)
to the Bureau. The Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II,

‘ 8/12/58
SAC LETTER NO. 58-47 oe Bee

NW 55829 « Docld:32989712 ‘Page 184



Section 7, Subsection A, Item 2d, (2), provides that all
vouchers containing confidential blue slips must be sent
by Registered #ail, Return Receipt Requested, the inner
envelope addressed to the Assistant Director, Administrative
Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Attention Voucher
Unit. Honthly reports of confidential expenditures must be
handled in the same manner. The envelope should not be

mt marked Personal and Confidential. You should bring this
matter to the attention of all employees responsible for
handling the mailing of these items.

MONTHLY REPORTS OF ‘CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES

In examining the above-captioned reports, the
Bureau has noted that the field is not being consistent
in the way the expenditures are summarized on the last
. page. Some reports include payments made to PCIs or PSIs
: with those to "Sources." Payments to PCIs or PSIs should
7 . be included with "Informants" and not with "Sources," Only
i those payments made to Confidential Sources, Panel Sources,
and Sources of Information should be included under
“Sources“ in vhe summary, make sure that the persons
responsible for the preparation and review of the report
are aware of the above.

(D) UTILIZATION OF FORM FD-221a - INFORMANT MATTERS ~~
Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants
(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to
give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as
follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize
“the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No
change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,
FD-221 and informant receipts. The maiter concerning security for
all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose
* of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security.

File No. : :

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND
SOURCES - INCOME TAXES =
eau.
No Number SAC Letter 63-E dated March 27, 1963, contained full
details and instructions for a withholding plan through.which it was hoped
security informants could satisfy their Federal income tax obligations
arising from payments made to them for services without jeopardizing
their security. The plan was tried or. a limited basis and has proven to"be
sound and effective. As a result, it will be expanded to include all field
divisions effective Jantary 1, 1965. Under the plan, payments to certain
security informants and sources for services rendered will be subject to a
20 per cent withholding tax. ’ >

There are four categories of circumstances in which taxes will
not be withheld. Taxes are not to Be withheld from payments made (1) to
other than security informants and sources, (2} for reimbursement of
expenses, (3) under SAC authority, or (4) to informants who have been able
to report Bureau income on thejr Federal tax returns without jeopardizing
their security or without challenge from the Internal Revenue Service.

é mire

* To place the plan into effect, you should immediately review the

perSonal situation of each security informant and source. Where circumstances
warrant using the procedure, the matter should be discussed with each informant
or source involved. It should be explained to each that the withholding procedure
to be.placed into effect January 1, 1965, is being adopted to afford a secure
method of meeting Federal income tax obligations in regard to money received
from the FBI for services. The Bureau must be advised by November 1, 1964,
of the identity of each informant to be exempted from this program and the
method to be used by each in reporting his Bureau income.

In operating the plan, you should be alert to streamline the procedures.
For example, instructians call for a check to be drawn for the gross amount of
an authorized payment. After it is cdshed, the amount to be withheld for taxes
is deducted and deposited in the special checking accourt; However, it is not
necessary to make a deposit in connection with each such transaction. If it
would simplify the matter, there would be no objection to making one deposit
at the end of each day for the total amount of money withheld that day from
payments to all informants.

as may be proper and feasible. «

(2) PAYMENTS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS ~- The Bureau.has received inquiries .
regarding the amount a Special Agent in Charge may approve paying an informant
without prior Bureau authority.

You are advised you may approve payment of an amount up to $50 to an
informant in a specific instance for information submitted. The blue slips
submitted for claiming these payments must clearly and adequately explain the
circumstances and summarize the information obtained so the Bureau will be in
a position to intelligently pass such slips for payment, receipts to be attached
wherever possible.

fhis does not change the present instructions that prior Bureau author-
ity must be obtained before paying an informant on a regular basis at a rate
exceeding $10 per menth, but applies only to specific instances in which it is
expedient or necessary to expend ey to obtain information concerning matters
or persons under investigation which information is not otherwise obtainable.
This of course does not apply to.expenditures for entertainment. You will be
held responsible to insure the Bureau receives full value for all the money
expended by you and such matters must receive your personal attention and ap-
proval. 7 :

money being paid to thes it is determined after a personal check of each p2.

have adequate justification for any approval or recommendation made
by you. For your information, fieid inspectors will bring with
| ‘them a representative number of blue slips executed by you and will
“trace these expenditures through appropriate files in order to
determine that value has been received for expenditures. Any
questionable items will result in interviews with employees and _

not authorize continued payments to security informants and con-
fidential sources furnishing information in security cases for
periods longer than three months. In the past the Bureau has
authorized continued payments to certain of these tndividuals for
periods as long as six ménths; however, this will no longer be the
ease and it will be necessary to justify continued payments to
security informants and to obtain additional authority for such

ee : The above will not change any authorizations presently

in effect even though they may be for ‘a six-month pericd, When
submitting justification for continued payment for any of ycur

‘ security informants, however, you should limit the pay period to
three months. Hs

It is pointed out that requests for authority to con-
tinue payments to informants should be submitted to the Bureau
at least two weeks prior to the expiration of the carrent pay

by the former Agent who claims amount was subsequently given to the

In order to eliminate unjust claims that Special Agents

informants, and sources either on the SAC's authority or on prior
Bureau approval, receipts are to be obtained in every instance where
it is possible to do so.

Receipts obtained in the future should clearly show the

In transmitting the receipts to the Bureau, they should
not be stapled to any other documents but should be enclosed in an

PAYMENTS ON SAC AUTHORITY

In specific instances in which it is necessary and ex-

pedient to expend money to obtain information concerning matters
or persons under investigation which is not otherwise obtainable
or to_advance expense money to enable an individual to obtain such
information, SAC may now approve such payments to a single individual
uo to $200 and totaling not more than $200 on a c.o.d.
rdless of the numer of payments. This applies only to

individuals who are not* being regularly paid for services or expenses
: on Bureau authorization, An individual who is paid on SAC authority
should not be described in correspondence as an informant or source
who is being paid on a "regular basis" or on “Bureau authorization."

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - RACIAL INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL
INFORMANTS - CONTROLS EXERCISED OVER PAYMENTS TO BUREAU
INFORMANTS -- You are reminded of the need to closely follow matters
involving payments to informants to insure that the Bureau is getting full
value for money expended and that the record shows complete justification
for all payments made.

7 Requests for authority to pay informants must be supported
by a summary of the information previously furnished in sufficient detail
to allow an intelligent analysis at the Bureau. The communication should
also show anticipated future coverage informant will provide and an
appraisal of the informant's value. You should also outline the nature of
the expenses incurred by the informant for which payment is being
requested. Payments for services must be made on a strictly c.o.d.
basis, and payments for expenses can only cover expenses actually _

incurred _by the infor i ining int ion for the Bureau.

The present Bureau system regarding the authorization
of payments to informants affords close supervisory control in the field

(H) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently there ve Wht i
were held at the Seat of Government specialized conferences concerning A fon
militant black nationalist investigations and racial informant matters.
These conferences were attended by representatives from key field 7
offices handling the major portion of the Bureau's work in this field. *

The conferees were unanimous in their observation that
money is the primary motivating force in developing racial informants.
In view of this, they recommended that each Special Agent in Charge be
given authority to expend up to $400 in the development of racial
informants instead of the $200 the majority of Special Agents in Charge

+ may now expend on their own authority.

Iconcur with this recommendation of the conferees and
effective March 15, 1968, the Special Agents in Charge of all field
‘divisions are authorized to expend the sum of $400 in the development
of racial informants. In this connection, you are reminded that money
expended for informant development must be on ac.o.d. basis and full
value must be received in proportion to the amount of money, expended.
Appropriate Manual change will be forthcoming. BEEEE

(D) SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you
are aware, all security informants and sources receiving compensation
from the Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information
furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has
been noted that some informants and sources have been paid consistently
the same amount each month with no variation in payments during
periods when the informants or sources were less productive, which
jeads to the illogical implication ihat information furnished or expenses
incurred or both seldom, if ever, vary. This practice must be
discontinued. Your informants and sources must understand they are
independent contractors remunerated ona C.O.D. basis, and they must
never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary.,

This matter will continue to receive careful consideration
at the Seat of Government and you will be held accountable to insure
that payments are for value received and no fixed patterns continue to
develop. These instructions should be called to the attention of all
Special Agents in your office handling security informants and
sources.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - SUBMISSION OF JUSTIFICATION
LETTERS <- Effective immediately justification letters for security
informants should be submitted each six months instead of each four
months as was previously required. Current authorized payments for
four months should be considered extended to six months from the
effective date. Under item four, requiring a “summary of information
furnished and/or services rendered during pertinent period," you
should henceforth include a brief statement as to what coverage or
informa tion furnished is available only from that source. In the event
there is none, a specific statement to that effect should be set out.

As I have previously emphasized, it is the responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to insure all expenditures for information
are onac.o.d. basis commensurate with the value of the information.
Excessive coverage of routine matters resulting in unwarranted
expenditures for the same information must not be approved. Good
i judgment must be exercised and, where possible and warranted, efforts

(B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As a are aware
informants and sources receiving compensation from the Bureau are
reimbursed on the basis of the value of the information reported,
services performed and expenses incurred. An increasing tendency
has been observed in field submissions to request special payments or
justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based

-on personal needs of the informant as distinct from the value of infor-
mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred. The
personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness
_or other pressing necessity for funds, do not meet the basic criteria
of information furnished or related expenses. Informants should not
be influenced to believe we.will pay for such personal needs. The
basic concept that the informant is selling information of value ona
c.0.d, basis, much as an independent contractor, and is not an
employee must be adhered to and understood by contacting Agents and
the informants.

This dees not, however, preclude use of imagination and in-
muvaliod When  scurce of anneidershta notential value needs financial
inducement to engage in gathering of information under conditions which
will take time to reach fruition and may involve considerable risk and
hardship. In such instances you should fully develop the facts and
present them to FBIHQ for approval prior to making any commitment.

This matter will continue to receive careful attention at FBIHQ
and you will be held accountabie to insure that payments are for value
received, These instructions should be called to the attention of all
Special Agents in your office handling informants and sources.
