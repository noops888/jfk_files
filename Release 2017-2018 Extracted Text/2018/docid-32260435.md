LARRY CECIL HUFF

of. lawful age, being produced, sworn, and examined on the

part of the Committee, deposeth and saith:

MS. BRADY: I have a few introductory remarks and

then we'll go into the questions.

First of all, for the record, I would like the

record to indicate that I, Surell Brady, have been designa-

ted by the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U. S.

House of Representatives, pursuant to House Resolution 222

and Committee Rule 4 to depose witnesses for the Committee.

Let the record also reflect that the witness, Lar-

ry Huff, H-u-f-f, is appearing voluntarily; that he has been

sworn by Federal Judge Marshall Neill, and agrees voluntar-

ily to be deposed.

Mr. Huff has been advised by me that he has the

right to have counsel

present at the deposition and that

Mr. Huff has voluntarily waived the right to the presence

of counsel.

Is that correct, Mr. Huff?

THE WITNESS:

That is true.

MS. BRADY: Mr. Huff has already stated that he

will

speak freely and accurately about matters covered by

the deposition and that he is under no restriction that

would prevent him from answering questions fully and accur-

ately or with any intent to deceive or withhold information.

Q Do you know when you received that assignment or

roughly when you received it?

A On or about 14 December 1963.

A.

It shows the month, jecember; year, 1963; day, the

14th; the model of the aircraft, which is a C-54-T; the ser-

tal number of the aircraft, 50855; departing Kaneohe Bay,

Hawali, for Wake Island; aboard the plane was chief warrant

officer Morgan, the pilot; the duration of the flight to

Wake Island was 11.1 hours; and the flight continues on into

Tachikawa, Japan; and aboard the same aircraft, the same

pilot, and myself as navigator.

This is where we let the CID team depart, debark,

our aircraft.

And where was that?

A. Tachikawa Air Force Base, Japan.

• Where is Tachikawa in relation to Atsuki, Japan?

A

Just a short distance; it is in the general vi-

cinity.

closer than Tokyo International.

Do you remember when you received these orders?

A. I would have received these orders the day prior

to departing Kaneohe Bay.

Q.

Was that the normal procedure for your flights?

A Yes; it is cálled operational orders signed by the

commanding officer to send us on a flight.

A.

The commanding officer was a Major

Rice. I do

have a piece of paper with his name on it.

Well, I thought I had a piece of paper which had

his name on it. He was a major. He was the commanding of-

ficer of it.

That's all right.

Were they written orders?

Oh, yes, they were written. They were typed or-

ders, is that what you mean by written?

Q

Yes.

A. Yes, typed orders, and he had his signature, to

send us on the flight.

@ And that is the way you always received orders?

A

Except in emergencies; sometimes we didn't have

time to get orders and we just went out, but this particular

case we were on orders.

Q.

Where do the orders from Commander Rice originate,

do you know?

A Where did they originate; they come down from Com-

mand, which would be Fleet Marine Corps, Pacific, Camp

Smith.

And who was the commander of the Fleet at that

time?

A.

Q

Lieutenant General. Carson A. Roberts.

Do you know for a fact that that these orders or-.

iginated with Lieutenant General Roberts of if they were

from Washington?

A I don't know for a fact but it is my conclusion

that they came from Headquarters, Marine Corps. I didn't

see the actual dispatch from Headquarters, Marine Corps, to

Commanding General Fleet Marine Corps, Pacific.

@ Now, the CID men you transported for the investi-

gation, had you flown with them before?

Not to the best of my knowledge.

Do you know or do you remember now any of their

A

Approximately how many were there?

A

Ten to twelve.

But they were investigators from CID?

A.

That's right.

& Was this assignment, to transport the CID inves-

tigators, a normal part of your duties or was it an unusual

assignment?

Usually we transported Commanding General Fleet

Marine Corps, Pacific. That was my reason for being atMarine

Corps Station, Kaneohe, but there were other times when they

would send us out on special missions.

Who were some of the other members of the crew be-

sides yourself and Commander Morgan?

tination.

@ Were you informed of the purpose of the flight?

A With conversation with the passengers aboard the

aircraft is the only way I was informed.

And what did that conversation tell you?

A It just told us that we were taking them out to

the Far East to investigate the doings of Lee Harvey Oswald

while he was stationed at Atsuki, Japan.

Q Did you receive any type of briefing before the

mission?

A : No, never.

Q During the flight, did you receive any information

about Oswald's connection to the military?

A On the return flight-this is on a different date,

but not on the flight going to the Far East.

Q

At that time, on the return flight, what informa-

tion did you get about Oswald and the military?

A I read the final report made up by the CID men,

which went to the Commanding General Fleet Marine Corps,

Pacific, on the duties, the type of person, that Lee Harvey

Oswald was while he was stationed at Atsuki, Japan.

Q

We will return to that later.

After you left the investigators at Tachikawa in

Japan, what did you do?

From Tachikawa we returned to our home base in

Kaneohe, Hawaii.

Did you make a return flight with the investiga-

tors?

20

A

Yes, ma'am.

Do you know what date that was?

A.

Yes, ma'am; I'll look in my log book again.

I made two flights during that period of time re-

turning me to Tachikawa Air Force Base, on December 20, 1963,

and then on January 29, 1964.

When you returned in December 1963 was that in

connection with this investigation?

To the best of ny knowledge, that I can remember

at this time, it was to pick up the CID team that we sent

out there.

Q.

So you believe you picked them up in December

22

23

1963?

.

Yes, ma'am.

Was it the same crew on the return flight?

Yes, ma'am, I would say it was the same crew as

we only had two aircraft at Hawaii, and we always flew to-

gether the same.

Q And what was the identification on the return

flight on the plane?

A.

On the return flight it was a VC-54-P; serial nun-

ber, 90392; and Captain Kruse, K-r-u-s-e, was the plane

commander on that particular flight.

And was it the same group of CID investigators

Q

returning?

A

Yes, ma'am.

Q

At that time, on the return flight, did you have

any conversations with the CID investigators about their

investigation in Japan?

A

Just ordinary talk, you know, ask how they went,

how things went for then, you know, and--

(Interrupting) Was it your understanding they had

spent the entire time in Japan investigating Lee Harvey Os-

• 19

20

wald?

Yes, ma'am.

And did they give you any other information about

their investigation or the conclusions they came to?

A.

to.

Aboard the aircraft in flight.

Did the report have any classifications or mark-

Q

ings on it?

A.

Yes, ma'am; secret, classified secret, and it was

for Marine Corps eyes only.

@ Was it typed on handwritten?

A.

It was typed, it was a finished product.

& And what are your recollections from that record

that you read?

My recollection is it was their conclusion that

Lee Harvey Oswald was not capable of performing an assassi-

nation on his own.

& Do you remember what details the report went into

or how they conducted the investigation?

A

This was his psychological make-up, it was their

believe that he was just not the type that--

Q

(Interrupting) If you recall; did the report con-

tain interviews of people who had known Oswald?

A.

Military people and civilian people around the

area, yes, ma'am.

Q

Was it unusual that you would have been able to

read that report on the return flight?

No, ma'am.

Qi :

Why was it not unusual?

A. I had a secret clearance, and I could always see

the reports laying around on the type of flights that I did.

Did everyone on that flight have a secret clear-

ance, to your knowledge?

•A.:

Yes.

Q

When did you receive your secret clearance?

I have that here with me, too.

It was dated 5 March 1956.

Q

And where were you at that time?

A. I was stationed at Cherry Point, North Carolina.

Right now you are referring to a document for that

information.

• What is that document?

Certificate of Clearance for Handling Classified

Material.

Q. And is there a commanding officer's signature?

A No. There is a By Direction of James C. Lindsey

signature. That is the man who approved the clearance.

Q. Was the fact of this flight classified?

A... All flights and movements of personnel are con-

sidered classified in the military.

• Is there any other information from that report

that you can recall at this time?

..A.

No, ma'am.

proximately December of I963 when you were reading it?

Yes.

@ Did you ever see the report or hear anything more

about it after that flight?

A

No, ma'am.

@ Do you have any knowledge as to how it was stored

or where after the investigation?

A

Due to my military career, I would say it was

either stored at Camp Smith, Hawaii, in the Intelligence

Division, or sent on to Commandant Marine Corps, Washington,

D. C.

Were there any Naval Intelligence officers?

A No, ma'am.

Did you receive any type of debriefing after that

investigation flight?

A

No, we never had debriefings on these types of

flights, never had any debriefings.

Were you ever instructed to keep the contents of

Q

Yes.

Q

Did you ever hear of another investigation about

Lee Harvey Oswald or the assassination by the military?

A Yes; I was talking to Master Gunnery Sergeant

George Moffett at El Toro, Califomia, which is a Marine

Corps station, and he informed me that they were sending a

flight to Dallas, Texas.

And this date, according to my log book, when I

was in California, was November 23, 1963.

And why did you have occasion to speak to George

Moffett, what was your relationship to him?

Well, George Moffett was the senior navigator at

Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro. I happened to be in El

Toro at the time when the President was assassinated, and

the next day I left for Hawaii. And I had the conversation

about the assassination and he said, he told me, that they

were sending a team fróm Camp Pendleton and El Toro to Dal-

las.

Was he to be part of that team?

What were his responsibilities with that investi-

gation?

A.." He, again, also was the navigator for the air-

craft.

Q

Did you ever speak to George Moffett again about

that investigation?

A Not to the best of my knowledge, though it could

have been in general conversation.

Q From your later conversation with George Moffett,

do you know if the investigation in Dallas took place?

A. To the best of my knowledge, through hearsay,

through George, it definitely took place, yes..

Q... Did you ever hear any report. or see any report

about that investigation?

A No, ma'am.

Q. Do you know what conclusions that investigation

reached?

A.

No, ma'am.

Q

You have explained that your normal assignment was

navigator for transport

flights, is that correct?

•Yes, ma'am.

Q: From which office did you usually receive orders?

Usually we got our orders from Marine Corps,

Pacific, Camp Smith;

they came down to us.

Q

And where did your flights usually take you?

To the Far East.

Always to the Far East?

A Well, the Far East and the West Coast, because

General Roberts was Fleet Marine Corps, Pacific, Commander,

so he was on inspection tours all of the time.

MS. BRADY: If we could go off the record so I

could check my notes--

(Thereupon a short recess was had.)

MS. BRADY: On the record.

BY MS. BRADY:

Q

Mr. Huff, for your normal assignments out of Camp

Smith, what type of identification did you carry?

A Our passports, which were dummied up, and our ID

cards on our flights, and my log books.

& When you say your passports were dummied up, what

are you referring to?

A.

They give us a passport in Hawaii that was not a

true copy. It doesn't even have my wife listed or children

listed in it. When we went out on secret flights we had to

have it with us..

Q

Who issued that passport to you?

A.

The passport office in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Q.

Do you have that passport with you?

A.

Yes, ma'am.

Q.

And what is the number of that passport book?

A.

Z. 091237.

And what is the date of issue of that passport?

A.

3 April 1962.

Q

Is all of the information in that passport about

you correct?

A. ": No.

Q What information is not correct?

A: It says wife and minors; none; and I had three

children and a wife at that time.

Q.

So the information was purposely--

(Interrupting) Deleted.

& And you were instructed to carry this with you on

all flights?

On all of our flights in the Far East, yes. If

we ever got shot down, we were supposed to tear this off. and

burn it, the front cover.

You have stated that you flew near Atsuki Air Base.

What was your understanding of the nature of the work at

Atsuki?

A.

I was stationed at Iwakuni, Japan,

in 1958 and '59

and '60, and we had to fly every day--not myself personally

but our squadron had to fly every day to Atsuki, Japan, to

get our mail.

a classified base?

A.

And what was the nature of Iwakuni Base, was that

It was partially classified, yes. It was a secret

base.

Did most people on the base need a secret clear-

ance?

Yes.

Were there any normal, nonclassified units at

Iwakuni?

Well, other than your Headquarters and Command,

yes.

25

Was there a hospital at Iwakuni?

A

Yes.

Did that hospital service military personnel who

did not have secret classifications?

Q

A

Yes.

Were they flown in from other areas?

No, not to the best of my knowledge.

Are you speaking of wounded men?

Or men with any type of illness requiring hospital-

No, usually they were shipped out to Yokohama

Naval Base where you have a hospital, not at Iwa.

Q.

From the time that you were stationed at Iwakuni

or later at Camp Smith were you aware of the work being done

at Atsuki, Japan, by the military?

Yes.

Q" And do you know the nature of that work?

Yes; Atsuki is a naval air station. They had a

U-2 stationed there on the east side of the campb.

@ Was all work related to the U-2 classified as far

as you knew?

Yes, ma'am, all work was classified, yes, ma'am.

To the best of your knowledge, was radar work con-

nected with the U-2 classified?

A Most certainly, yes, classified.

@ Mr. Huff, you have kept personal log books of your

flights. What other type of records are maintained for the

military flights that you participated in?

A Well, there is a master log on every flight, mil-

itary aircraft, that is ever taken.

Where is that log maintained?

A It is maintained in the operations office of each

individual squadron and then, in turn, it is sent to the

chief of naval operations for their records.

So an original or a copy would have been main-

tained at Camp Smith for your flights?

A.

The original for my particular flights were kept

at Marine Corps Air Station, Kaneohe; not Camp Smith.

And how were those logs listed, were they listed

by pilot names, by flight numbers or how?

It had the serial number of the aircraft, the

duration of the flight, the CO from point of departure to

the first point of landing; time en route, day flight, night

flight, and the names,

serial numbers of all crew members

aboard that flight.

To the best of your knowledge, were those master

logs ever destroyed periodically?

A

No, they are not. They are kept on file with CNO,

chief of naval operations.

Mr. Huff, how long were you stationed in Kaneohe,

until what year?

A Until Viet Nam broke out, and I will have to look

at my log book.

We were the first outfit in Viet Nam after the

police action or whatever you want to call it started in

force.

As the first Marine Brigade was stationed in Kane-

ohe, also, when we first go in at Da Nang, Viet Nam, and that

would have been March 1965, that I went to Viet Nam.

And how long were you in Viet Nam?

A : I was in there a short period of time. My step

father died and I was transferred back to Spokane here un-

til determination of his death, and then I was transferred

to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro.

Q

Excuse me, when was your step father's death,

roughly, if you know the date or year?

In the fall of 1965 or spring of 1966.

Q. And what was your next assignment after that?

A.

Marine Air Station, El Toro, California.

And how long were you there?

A Until the rest of my time in the Marine Corps. I,

of course, flew in and out of the Far East, Da Nang, Viet

Nam; I spent there one month, I got 31 months combat pay in

Viet Nam.

Q And when did you retire from the military?

A.

1 July 1970.

And that was an honorable discharge?

A Yes.

That is hanging up on the wall at home. I didn't

bring it. You don't need a copy of that, do you?

@ No, that's fine.

Are there any other questions or areas that you

feel we should have covered about the investigation that

you have participated in?

I feel in my own mind this report and/or the re-

CID.

Are there any other areas you wish us to cover

examination of the deposition by the witness, the read-
