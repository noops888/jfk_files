of Lake Okeechobee; where they contacted the Commissionér#
of Hendry County, Mr. CAMPBELL NALL, for the purpose of
opening a training camp at the local airport. Commissioner
NALL was reluctant to give permission to the Cubans for use
of the airport property at Clewiston, because the Federal
Aviation Agency might object. In an effort to persuade g a
Commissioner NALL, the Cubans offered to repair the :
buildings on the airport property and to pay for use
of the airport but NALL objected to this. (Ya)

Also on 4/8/64, MM 639-S advised that JURE
has a bank account at the Central Bank and Trust Company,
Miami, and the account might be in the name of JURE or
possibly in the name of LUIS POSADA. The source stated
that MARIO HERNANDEZ, one of the JURE members visiting
the afore-described training camp, resides at 7146 S.W.
26th Street, Miami. (fm)

On 5/25/64, Mr. KENNETH BLONDUN, an officer
at the Central Bank and Trust Company, Miami, Florida,
advised that there was no account at the bank in the
name of Junta Revolucionaria Cubana or Cuban Revolu-
tionary Junta, or JURE. He advised LUIS POSADA of 1111
N.W. 34th Avenue, Miami, had opened a Special Account in
March, 1964. The record indicated POSADA had served in
