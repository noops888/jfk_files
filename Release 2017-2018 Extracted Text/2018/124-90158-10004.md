On 4/8/64, MM 639-S advised that LUIS

APOSADA, in charge of training for the Junta Revolu-

cionaria Cubana

(JURE) , together with JURE members

MARION HERNANDEZ and LUIS FERNANDEZ, had recently

visited Clewiston, Florida, a town on the south shore

of Lake Okeechobee, where they contacted the Commissioner

of Hendry County, Mr. CAMPBELL NALL, for the purpose of

opening a training camp at the local airport. Commissioner

NALI was reluctant to give permission to the Cubans for use

of the airport property at Clewiston, because the Federal

Aviation Agency might object. In an effort to persuade

Commissioner NALL, the Cubans offered to repair the

buildings on the airport property and to pay for use

of the airport but NAiL objected to this. (9m)

contact with Commissioner NALL, the members of JURE

proceeded to an established training camp located

somewhere between Clewiston and Tampa, Florida, about

80 miles from Clewiston. The source further advised

that JURE had 2 teams of 18-20 men per team, ready to

undertake training in guerrilla warfare. The in-

structors were to be Cubans who had been in the U.S.

Army; the source also believed that 2 or 3 American

instructors might be involved. (K(M)

Also on 4/8/64, MM 639-S advised that JURE

has a bank account at the Central Bank and Trust Company,

Miami, and the account might be in the name of JURE or

possibly in the name of LUIS POSADA. The source stated

that MARIO HERNANDEL, one of the JURE members visiting

the arore-described training camp, resides at 7146 S.W.

Loth Street, Miami. elm)

On 5/25/64, Mr. KENNETH BLONDUN, an officer

at the Central Bank and Trust Company, Miami, Florida,

advised that there was no account at the bank in the

name of Junta Revolucionaria Cubana or Cuban Revolu-

tionary Junta, or JURE. He advised LUIS POSADA of 1111

N.W. 34th Avenue, Miami, had opened a Special Account in

March, 1964. The record indicated POSADA had served in

the U.S. Armyâ€¢

On 6/12/64, Mr. BLONDUN was recontacted, at

which time he made available the monthly statement of

POSADA's account, #4-69-236-2, together with the checks

issued by POSADA during the previous month. Only 5

checks had been drawn on the account during the monthly

period ending 6/4/64, at which time a balance of $18.50

remained in the account. The checks were made payable

On June 19, 1964 MM 639-S was recontacted,

4/29/92

at which time he advised he no longer had close asso-

ciation with JURE at Miami, and therefore was uninformed

as to the current training operation by JURE, however,

he believed that the training camp described in the

caption of this case is identical with the one he had

reported on 4/8/64-Gefm)

The Miami Office will interview persons asso-

ciated with JURE for information concerning the military

training of JURE in Florida and in particular on the

property of Weir W. Williams in Polk County, Florida.
