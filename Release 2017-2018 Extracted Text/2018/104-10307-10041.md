Re:

United States v. Bobbie Joe Keesee

Criminal Case No. 74-1158

Dear Mr. Colvy:

The above-referenced individual is presently under

indictment in the Southern District of California for the

kidnapping of Vice Consul John S. Patterson wo disappeared

from his post on March 22, 1974, at the American Consulate

in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico,

and whose decomposed body

was discovered on July 7, 1974, in an arroyo approximately

8 miles from Hermosillo. Keesee is charged in count one

with conspiring to kidnap Patterson. Counts two, three,

and four charge him with travel across state lines and in

foreign commerce to facilitate and perpetrate the kidnapping.

Count five charges him with mailing a handwritten extortion

note to the American Consulate in Hermosillo from San Diego.

[A copy of the indictment, as well as a copy of Keesee's rap

sheet are enclosed.]

Keesee may, if. certain presently

unresolved jurisdictional requirements are met, shortly be

charged with the actual murder in addition to the five counts

adverted to above:

As you are no doubt aware, Keesee has a number of

federal felony convictions, one of which involved an alrplane

which he stole and flew into Cuba in 1962.

He was later

indicted in the District of New Mexico and ultimately convicted.

However,

during the course of the trial in late 1963, he alleged

that his escapade across the country and eventually into Cuba

cour the

was carried out at the request and direction of the C.I.A.

Whe jury fortunately recognized the absurdity of his story

and convicted him.

However, prior to trial, your agency was

requested to supply, if necessary, a witness who could refute

such a bizarre tale. Although no direct testimony on this

issue was necessary, you agreed to supply such a person

should the need arise. [I have also enclosed copies of your

correspondence with the.U. S. Attorney for your convenience.]

I am afraid insofar as Bobbie Joe Keesee is concerned, history

seems to repeat itself every 10 years. Keesee is now

telling

his attorney, has already told a number of agents, and may

assert at trial, a sinilar type story, i.e., that his

involvement in the above-referenced case arose out of his

relationship with C.I.A. operatives and unidentified

international conspirators.

Although this obviously sounds

a little ludicrous, Keesee

has tried it before and is capable

of trying it again.

Considering that he spent 29 months as

a civilian P.O.W. in North Vietnam and in the process had his

teeth knocked out and all of his toenails ripped out, anything

is possible.

It would be appreciated if you could state in letter

or memo form whether Keesee has ever been employed by the

C.I.A. I am hopeful that a categorical denial of any C.I.A.

employment or sanction will satisfy his defense attorney and

deter him from pursuing this line of defense.

Please be assured :

that I will not call a C.I.A. employee as a witness unless it

becomes actually necessary.

very truly yours,
