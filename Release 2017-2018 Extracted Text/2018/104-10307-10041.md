Washington, D. C. 20505

Re: United States v. Bobbie Joe Keesee
Criminal Case No. 74-1158

Dear Mr. Colvy: ie

The above-referenced individual is presently under
indictment in the Southern District of California for the
kidnapping of Vice Consul. John S. Patterson who disappeared
from his post on March 22, 1974, at the American Consulate
in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, and whose decomposed body
was discovered on July 7, 1974, in an arroyo approximately
8 miles from Hermosillo. Keesee is charged in count one
with conspiring to kidnap Patterson. Counts two, three,
and four charge him with travel across state lines and in
foreign commerce to facilitate and perpetrate the kidnapping.*
Count five charges him with mailing a handwritten extortion
note to the American Consulate in Hermosillo from San Diego.
[A copy ‘of the indictment, as well as a copy of Keesee's rap
sheet are enclosed.] Keesee may, if.certain presently
unresolved jurisdictional requirements are met, shortly be
charged with the actual murder in addition to the five counts
adverted to above. =

As you are no doubt aware, Keesee has a number of"
federal felony convictions, one of which involved an airplane
which he stole and flew into Cuba in 1962. He was later
indicted in the District of New Mexico and ultimately convicted.
However, during the course of the trial in late 1963, he alleged
that his escapade across the country and eventually into Cuba
was carried out at the request and direction of the C.I.A.



Mr. William B. Colby oe August 9, 1974

és
@he jury fortunately recognized the absurdity of his story

and convicted him. However, prior to trial, your agency was
requested to supply, if necessary, a witness who could xéfute
such a bizarre tale. Although no direct testimony on this

‘issue was necessary, you agreed to supply such a person

should the need arise. [I have also enclosed copies of your
correspondence with the .U. S. Attorney for your convenience.]
I am afraid insofar as Bobbie Joe Keesee is concerned, history
seems to repeat itself every 10 years. Keesee is now telling
his attorney, has already told a number of agents, and may
assert at trial, a similar type story, i.e., that his
involvement in the above-referenced case arose out of his
relationship with C.I.A. operatives and unidentified
international conspirators. Although this obviously sounds =;
a little ludicrous, Keesee has tried it before and is capable
of trying it again. Considering that he spent 29 months as

a civilian P.O.W. in North Vietnam and’ in the process had his
teeth knocked out and all of his toenails ripped out, anything
is possible.

It would be appreciated if you could state in letter
or memo form whether Keesee has ever been employed by the
C.I.A, I am hopeful that a categorical denial of any C.I.A.
employment or sanction will satisfy his defense attorney and 7
deter him from pursuing this line of defense. Please be assured -
that I will not call a C.I.A. employee as a witness unless it
becomes actually necessary.

Very truly yours,
