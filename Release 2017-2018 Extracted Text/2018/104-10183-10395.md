REFERENCE: DIRECTOR ‘S4t9, 19 May: 1966
E 1. Some difficulty was initdally encountered in. arranging a
mecting with AMWHIP/2, during his ‘clrreht: visit. “He telephoned. ~

AMWHIP/1 to: kiow of his (A/2's)* association’ With KUPARK (and ‘the.
undersipned heartily 68) he said that’he would-call ‘back when
the coast was clear. Arranzements were finally made for dinner on
24 May, when BUNCE's wife was also present, and lunch of 25 May.

2. AMWHIP/2 was told that we should like to maintain contact
with him after BUNCE leaves Home, but that the person who would be
in touch with hin was aot yet on the scene. After some hesitation
he said that he was willinre to meet a successor on two conditions,
The first was that he would handled by the successor as he has
been handled in the past ! tation)Comment: AMWHIP/2 meant that
he was willing to continue to provide information on the Present
basis - i.e., that he is unpaid, that his cooperation is voluntary,
and that he will not be required to eacage in activity which could
endaner hia security or business.) The second condition was that
he would continue to be handled by. a senior perron, because for
security reasons he wants knowledge of ‘his contact to be as tiphtly
reatricted as possible! tation)Comment: AMWHIP/2 has no know-
Yedue, of course, of BUNCE’s position but has always assumed that
it is important.) AMWIIIP/2 was assured that both conditions would
be wet. 7

+ 9. Per @RLW223055, 11 May 1966 (not to Gritzeriand) AMWHIP/2
was not civen any specific facts about Josef Wilhelm FROTZ. He was
asked if he had seen FROTZ ayain and said yes. He met FHOTZ recently
(about 23 May 1966) at the Hilton Hotel. FKOTZ anid he had been very
busy buf expected soon to have time for a deal if AMWHIP/2 is inter-
estes It seems that FROTZ's uncle is a bishop in Cermany (as report.
ed in GOKE394Z0, 22 march 1966), The Catholic church is ‘engared in
smu,.pling Valuable art objects out of Hunsary (and perhaps other
European satellites, thouyh AMWHIP/2 does not know the latter as a
fact) in order to ryatse money, FHOTZ gets these objects from his
uncle and sells thes, actually or ostensibly for the church.

AWNHIP/2 would like to ;et into the act, which he believes ia lucra-
tive. He explained that FROTZ bas on deposit in a bank in Switzorlan
.a gold-colored or gold-plated statue weizhing about three kilos and
priced at about, 25,000 Syies francs. The. statue case from Runyary.
AWSHIP/2 thinks he haw a buyer, AMWIIIP/2 had taken the precaution
“of checkiny with a Corman credit rating outfit in Germany, however,
and had learned that Fa0Ti had twice been charjed with passin, bad
checks. To AMWHIP/2's direct request, BUNCE said only that FROTZ

ig an East-West trader vho soens to have soacthing of a reputation
tor fraud, AMWHIP/3 sald that he would lixe to try to do business
with FROTZ, both berause he may be involved in matters of some
intelli;ence intercat and because he thinks that he (A/2) could thus
make some money, A/2 nav vo real daner in the association, now that
he has been warned an¢ hia cyoa are open,

12, Repardin, his association with AMLASH/1, AMAINP/2 repented
the information reported in @1#A}41342. He gays that on the occasion
