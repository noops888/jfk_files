1. We would like to take time out in our investigation of the President's
assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.
Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only
major overseas reporter in the case. While this is partly dictated by the
facts of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked the really outstanding per-
formance of Mexico City's major assets and the speed, precision, and perception
with which the date was forwarded. Here it was relayed within minutes to the
White House, ODACID, and ODENVY. :

2. Your LIENYOY data, the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses
were major factors in the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really
ominous spectre of foreign backing.

3. We regret that we have been able to send you so little information in
return, but we have not been given much yet. We do know that Lee OSWALD denied
he had ever been to Mexico except for a jump to Tie Juana. We have quickly
screened the FBI report on the whole case but we do not yet have ea copy for
retention. It does not compromise your sources. Basically, what the New York

Times has printed about the report is all true.

3. We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO
story was the most troublesome. They are still coming in.

your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy
