thines that has impressed me most during my nine months as Chief of the Counter-
intelligence Staff has been the inpact of the publications program on the intel-
Tigence commmity at large. In the CI field, there is nothing in the U.S.
Government comparable to it. With the current intensification of interest in
counterintelligence, it affords the Agency a means of speaking to a wide audience
on issues and problems of abiding concern. Mr, Wigren has done excellent work in
drawing upon the resources of the ;_to-collect and then to. present counterintel-

cations of counterintelligence materials ady one of the new CI

Nr Wigren. 1s doing a quite satisfactory Job of running the R&A External Research
Branch, When“the Group was reorganized he was almost fully committed to Duty No. 3

has accepted the assignment of running a new branch which {3 an amalgamation of
components of several previous R&A branches. Comprising, as it does, the disparate
clements of. defector, contract, and staff officers, Mr, Wigren has done a very
good job of assigning work and getting tt done by this branch. Ie gets along well
with the personnel and seems well-sul ted to the kind of bread-and-buttor research
and analysis which the branch carries out. He is very ‘serious and purposefulin his
approach and-can be relied on to carry out assignments effectively and on time. His
long experience in CI matters and his knowledge of past activities and events in the
Staff are a valuable adjunct to.the branch chief function which he now fulfills:
He is one of very few officers of the former Staff who have been selected to par~
ticipate in the reorganization and reortentation of the Cleffort. He has shown
by his performance and attitude a quite acceptable capability to adjust to the
Present Staff requirements in terns of methodology and intellectual approach. He is
conscientious and enthustastic, and is still feeling his way to some extent
organizationally and functionally in his new position.

He reflects genuine consideration for the costs of performing his functions.

earl

As was noted in the preceding fitness report, Mr. Wigren has a solid and
broad knowledge of the USSR: its history, government, and intellig services.
He #lso has a useful working knowledge of Russian, Consequently he serves in
CU/RHA as senior referent on the RIS, against which target most of the group's

work is directed, as

“A key responsibility in R&A is to serve/the Staff's repository and memory
for essential elements of information about the RIS. Mr. Wigren has organized
this abundance of material effectively, has ensured its retricvability, and con-
tinues to update it,

Mr, Wigren consistently shows sound and dispassionate judgment, He does
not jump to conclusions but digs out the pertinent facts and brings them into
Proper focus, He is skeptical without being negative, He accepts tasks and
responsibilities without quibbling, and he carries oul these assignments suc-
cessfully without needing further consultation or guidance.

He is a quict person who keeps a low profile; but whén a aignificant issue
is at stake, he is firm, even tenacious, when persuaded that the facts are on
his side.

Mr. Wigren is a conscientious and capable rescarch officer
with a good grasp of his material ‘and is able Méllpiugsent it
effectively to audiences of widely varicd sophistication. Since
his last report, jthe basic orientation of SR/CI has changed, and is
now directed almost wholly to the creation and cxploitation of opera~
tions. The organization thus needs more urgently than ever the
digested operational expericnce which it is Nr. Wigren's job to
produce. This has made it.tiecessary. to apply strict priorities

. based: on operational need and relevancy, which has been difficult
for Mx. Wigren, who has no direct operational experience. He
has not been able to get the most out of his people, nor give them
the sort of close .and'consistent guidance which some of them require
in the face of changing or sudden requirements. le has a tendency
to be over-concerned with’ organizational and bureaucratic exercise
to the expense of substantive production. Nonetheless, his reat
qualities came to the fore recently when he produced well and used
his staff effectively on an important and complicated project
He is a distinct asset in his responsible and demanding job.

Mr. Wigren performs his duties with maximum economy

Mr. Wigren has excellent substantive background on the Soviet Union and,
except for a two year period on'a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire
9 yea in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another,
His performance for the past year ina job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's
can only be described as Superior, He has not only assumed responsibilities
greater than those of the previous incumbents; he has carried these out with
a minimum of support and ina calm, mature manner which has earned.
respect on all sides. Although his analysts have often been relatively
inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and
subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contri-
bution during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of
research in. response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish-
ment of improved records and procedures to carry out this program,

Although Mr. Wigren would Prefer eventual assignment to the field as an
Operational officer, it seems to me his greatest potential lies in the kind of
research and support of operations. he is presently performing. { would therefore
recommend that future training be oriented along these lines rather than strictly
operational lines, and that planning for his eventual field assignment should
emphaSize his knowledge of Soviet Intelligence and his ability to deal with
Gther specialists in a "liaison" relation,

Mr. Wigren has also asked that it bo made a matter of rocord that, for
a period of three months in.1356, ho woo actigg chief of the

extent of his rasponsibilitios. Certainly the, routiae business of the
doak waa kept moving. during thie period. I have pointed out with reapect
to the maauer-of hia performnoe of his duties that his fitness report Lo not
on unfavorable onc. The factors which have turned this annual fitnosa
roport into a porsonal crisie for him'are tho simultaneous deferment of
his hopsd-for promotion, and the deferment of an ovorseas assignmont far
him «= both .of which actions naturally refleot on his past performances
T have pointed out that wo have to requiro aprructably bettor than
average performances from officers we send overseas, that I bolieve we
have in the Branch at least one bettor qualifiod candidate for tho
overseas assignment in question, and that T am obliged to give the
ansignmont to the porson-I fool 1s boot qualifiod.

Porhaps understandably, Mr. Wigren continues to bolieve that this |
report la not a fair reflection of hia performance, I have told him
that Ican go no further in attompting to oxplain my judgement and have
asked that he digouss his situation with the Deputy Division Chief
