adopted. in the interest of expositing this screening

process so that those employces who are eligible do participate in the Sys-

ten may be designated

participants as soon as possible.

In your case, the lead of your Career Service has advised me

you do not meet the requirenones of li 20-50 for deafgnation

pant and I have accordingly made the formal determineton required by the

regulation that you are not cligible for designation.

From a review of your

record le appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you bave 15 years of more of Agency service, but have not as

yot performed 60 months of quallying service as required by regulation. My

determination that you aro noe ellable at this time for destination In no

way affects your current status under the Clvil Service Retirement System,

nor does lt preclude reconalderation of your eligibility to partleipate in

the CiA System If you should meet the requirements for dosignation in the

future.

Should you desire further information concerning

the roquirements

for designation as a participant in the ClA Rettrement Syarem, I suggest that

you read parngraph e of Hk 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the limployce Bulletin

dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Publle Law 88-643, The Control IntellIgence

Agency Betirement Act of 1964 for Cortaln Employees."

I't 1s always possible that the records upon which the determination

made In your case may have been Inconplete or innecurate regarding your actual

employment history with the Agency.

If, after studying

above, you have

questions regarding

determination that you are not clagi

ble to parefcipate in the ClA Retirement System, Please

feel froe to contact

officials of your Career Service.

They are familiar with the detalls of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

additlon, you may wish to

your case with the CIA Ketirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine

Bullding (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions

you have regarding your ellaibility, you may request that your case he fornally

considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be

In 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

Mr. Wigren. Is doing a quite satisfactory job of running the R&A External Research

Branch.

When the Group

reorganized he was almost fully committed to Duty No. 3

above.

While maintaining that function at a commendable level of performance, he

has accepted the

assignment of running a new branch which is an amalgamation of

components of several previous R&A branches.

Comprising, as it does.

the disparate

clements of defector, contract, and staff officers, Mr. Wigren has done a very

good job of assigning work and

getting

it done by

this branch.

He gets along well

with

the personnel and seems well-sulted

to the kind of bread-and-butter research

and analysis which the branch carries out.

He is very serious and purposeful in his

approach and can be relfed

on to carry out assignments effectively and on time.

His

long experience in Cl matters and his knowledge of past activities and events in the

Staff are a valuable adjunct to the branch chief function which he now fulfills:

He is one of very few officers of the former Staff who have, been selected to par-

ticipate in the reorganization and reorientation of the CI

effort. He has shown

by his performance and attitude a quite acceptable capability to adjust to the

present Staff requirements in terns of methodology and intellectual approach. He is

conscientious and enthustastic, and is still feeling his way to some extent

organizationally and functionally in his new position.

Me reflects genuine consideration for the costs of performing his functions.

In the past six months the compartmonted naturo of Nr. Wigron's work

has brought him more directly into the DC/CIOPS cognizance rather than the

Cluer of the R&A component as has previoudly been the case.

I think Mr. Wigren's strengths and weaknesses have boon winnowed

thoroughly in previous reporting: He is a rocognized expert in his topic and as

such he represents a considerable capital investment by the Agency in that kind

of expertise. He can irite and he can speak with unusual fluency on his specialty

and in consequence is a key man in the ongoing rosearch and study of sensitive

Soviet intelligence and security organizationd and operations, particularly pone-

trations and disinfornation. This statement is backed up by the production, in

the form of briefing papers,, memoranda, and othor production, which goos out-

eudo the Agency The found he work to bo extremely antiactor earlenes

particularly, it is if he is given the time and specifications which are,

of his meticulous and thoroughgoing approach to hio work. Mr. Wigron could

in Soviet intelligenco and security.

Mr. Wigren is a

with i good grasp of his material and is able Vallpront it

effectively to audiences of widely varied

his last report, ithe basic orientation of

sophistication.

Since

SR/CI has changed: and

1s

now dirceted almost wholly to the creation and cxploltation of opera

tions.

The organization thus needs

more

urgently than ever the

digested operational experience which it is Mi. Wigren's job to

produce.

This

has made it necessary to apply strict priorities

based on operational need and relevancy,

which has been difficult

for Mr. Wigren, who has no direct opcrational experience. He

has not been able to get the most out of his people, nor give them

the sort of close and consistent guidance which some of them regutre

in the face

of changing or sudden requirements.

He has a tendency

to be over-concerned with organizational and burcaucratic exercise

to the expense of substantive production.

Nonetheless,

qualities came to the fore recently when he produced well and used

his staff effectively on an important and complicated project.

Ho is a distinct asset in his responsible and demanding job.

Mr. Wigren performs his duties

That opinion was not discused with me or with

Perhaps the ratings were indeed too hien, but I must say that

considering the Fitnesa' Report form and criteria in use at that time and his

performance in relation

to that of other officers ir. this branch and outalde it,

I would elve him the sam. ratings today for that perica.

The ratingu in this current report will appear clichtly lower than those

of the last report. This lo not entirely due to tre dialerent report form.

Mr. Weren's problems increased in both intensity ard complexity during thie

period, and I do not feel that he met the increased burden with as nuch of ar

Give recommendations for his truining.

sponsibilities.

Amplity or exploin, il appropriate, ralings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D lo provido the best Dosis for determining

futuro personnel actions.

Mr. Wigren has excellent substantive background on the Soviet Union and,

except for a two year period on a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire

9 years in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another.

His performance for the past year in a job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's

can only be described as superior. He has not only assumed responsibilities

greater than those of the previous incumbents; he has carried these out with

a minimum of support and in a calm, mature manner which has earned

respect on all sides.. Although his analysts have often been relatively

inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and

subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contri-

button during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of

research in response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish

ment of improved records and procedures to carry out this program.

Although Mr. Wigren would prefer eventual assignment to the field as an

operational officer, it seems to me his greatest potential lies in the kind of

research and support of operations he is presently performing. I would therefore

recommend that future training be oriented along these lines rather than strictly

operational lines, and that planning for his eventual field assignment should

emphasize his knowledge of Soviet Intelligence and his ability to deal with

other specialists in a "liaison" relation.

I have pointod out with reapeot

to the manier. of hla performanoo of his dutios

that hig fltion roport la not

an unfavorable ono.

The faotors which have turned thin annual fitneso

roport into a porsonal cristo for him are tho simultaneous deforment of

he hopod-for promotion, and the deferment of an ovorseas assignment for

him - both of whioh actiona naturally refloot on his past performance.

I havo pointed out that no have to roguiro appruciably bottor than

Perhaps understandably, Mr. Migren continues to bollevo that thie

report la not a fair reflection of hia performanco. I hava told him

that I can go no further in attompting to explain my judgement and have

asked that he disouas hia situatlon with the Deputy Division Chlof
