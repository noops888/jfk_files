As you may rocall, it was originally thought that

A. OPERATIONAL HIGILIGITS

During the quartor under review AMSCROLL continued with

its program

to discredit the Cuban regime's cconomic management

(o1 mismanagement) and to sock to discourage Free World trado

with Cuba.

To this end AMSCROLL continued publishing its serious

cconomic studies and comnont of the Cuban oconomic arca.

material is mado avaiinblo to sclected flims engayed in intor-

in the sugar trado.

which is beamed to the Cuban nudience and which is incroasingly at

tempting to provide serious comment upon economic developments in

Cuba or those aroas of cconomic activity outside of Cuba which would

have an interost among the Cuban listeners.

ANSCROLL received 15 letters from Cuba which comparcs with 18 re-

coived during the provious quarter. The monthly count was: April

6, May - 5, June • 1.

2. On 30 April AMSCROLL ccased broadcasting over AMTHIGH.

Effective 1 May the program was presented over JMIOPE.

This change

in station (and a consequent change in timo) has perhaps effected

the listenership in Cuba; however,

we expect that any unfavorable

developments will be ovorcome and

that this program will at least

re-gain its previous levol of listoners.

Typical themes included

discussions of Cuba's housing problem, its actual sugar production

measured against Castro's earlier claims of what the production

would be, breakdowns and stoppages at the Cuban refineries, activ

Ities with the Soviet Union and the world sugar market, reporting

the progress of the Venczuelan dock workers boycott of

chose at no one spectate the cute cast criseanse bureau-

A main AMSCROLL cffort continued to be an analysis of the

current sugar crop.

as 13 February ANSCROLL predicted a

harvest within the range of 6,100,000 and 6, 400,000.

6, 101,000 tons.

This estimate was

tons in a release dated 16 June.

These studies received newspaper

brokers and other technicians engaged in this business.

Bots UP and AFP con-

tinued to filo this information which results in its being pub-

lished in the press and usud on radio nows broadasts.

Anscrous continued Its malling prograt to Cuba, and

during this quarter mailings approximated 5,000 hich is tho samo

level as the previous quartor.

B. ADMINISTRATION

The amount budgetod for tho quarter under reviow was

$33,500.00 of which $13, 332.45 was upon to the savings causad

This significant do

cline in expenses was in large part duo

by the cancellation of tho AMTHIGil radio prograz and by continuod

attention to economies of oporation within AUSCROLL itself.

C. PROBLEMS

The Station is not aware of any specific problems having

to do with the ANSCROLL organtzation.

Mention might be mado in

passing of the over presont norale problom (which is by no monna

limited to AMSCROLL) engondored by incrensing economies and ro

UNIDAD MONTHLY, ISSUE, NO. 37, May, 1967

This issue has been almost entiroly devoted to a reprint of I. Andrés Collazo's sta

tement concerning his experience as a CUFLET representative in london. we have a

printed most of the contents of the statement in the fom of a signed amticle sutl

tIed "INSIDE CUTIET".

As 1s known, Collazo tolls of the "dog fights" that have risen between the privateers

(such as FRANGISTAS) and CUFIET over violations of contracts, bad condition of the

ships, ote.

He also discusses the decline in free world shipping to Cuba and 1tg causes, as well

as the nature and background of the shippers that participate In the Cuban trade.

Besides the above, the following 15 Inciuded In this Issue:

PAGE 18.

EDITORIAL: "A OOMUNIST TRUTH": Volsky, the Chiel of the Soviet observing delezation

to the CEPAI meeting in Caracas, said that "Cuba is the minor daughter of the ISSA,

and ninor daughters are papered". The fussian's insolence has roused the anger of

all voll-born Cubans. Jet, there's a lot of truth in sat the fussian said.

Indeed, minor daughters depend on theds parents, get everything they need from that.

and are subject to their supreme authority. Il the daughter works, she must also turn

a gocd part of the fruits of her toil over to her parents.

This is what happens with Cuba and the USSR. The Soviets and their satellites sell

Cuba 78.6% of her imports, dictate the policy of the Havana régina, and take 80% of

her exporta

In view of this deperdence, who can deny that the relation between Caba and Bissia 1a

The fussian oniy lied when he spoke of lipampering". Cuba 1s not paupofed by Mother

Receipt of Information from Unidentified Source within Cuba

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES

Action Required: FYI

Reference:

None

1.

On 27 March 1967, a letter

from Cuba was received at

the postal address given

by the radio program of AMSCROLL.

The letter had been mailed in Habana on

4 March 1967 and the

contents included three photos of an unidentified individual

and one photo each of individuals identified as Reynaldo

*IRSULA Brea and Antonio FERNANDEZ Fernandez.

A note which

was included stated that henceforth the sendor would identify.

himself as *'Parcrasio".

He indicated that if it was desired

receipt of his letter could be mentioned on the AMSCROLL

radio program but that never should any mention of the

contents be mentioned as this could reveal his identity to

the DSE.

Pancrasio stated his help would not be much but

that his letters might contain information which could be

of value.

He wrote that he could not go into detail as

he was unable to spend much time at the typewriter..

Pancrasio concluded by saying the photos of Antonio and

Reynaldo were in the hands of a security agent who had

orders to find them.

They had both been fugitives for a

long time.

The other photo (in triplicate) was

of a

Canadian

citizen whose passport was

ALFONSO,

649 William Street, Key West.

Typed on ohe of the

two sheets of paper forwarded by Pancrasio was a note saying

this was lotter number for for persorin and requosting

Guillermo ALFONSO to forward the papers to the same postal

address which he had previously utilized.

Copies of the

contents of this letter are attached under separate cover.

The one paper,

dated 27 September 1961, appears to be a

list of Costa

Ricans who visited Cuba under the auspices of

ICAP.

The second paper appears to be a list of Brazilians

who visited Cuba, probably in mid 1960 when Janio QUADROS made

a visit to (uba as part of his presidential campaign in

Brazil.

On 2 May 1967, a JMWAVE Officer visited Guillermo

ALFONSO in an effort to identify Pancrasio and develop

sufficient information to evaluate his information and

deterrine the extent of his

access.

ALFONSO claimed he

had no idea as to the identity'of Pancrasio and was unable

to suggest possible candidates from his relatives in Cuba,

former work associates, classmates or neighbors.

ALFONSO

had retained the envelop from Cuba which contained Pancrasio's

second message and a short message to ALFONSO.

The note to

ALFONSO stated that Pancrasio had received ALFONSO's name

and address from some unidentified Individual and that it was

requested

that ALFONSO forward the contents of the letter to

the

AYSCROLL address which was enclosed.

ALFONSO was

cautioned not to mention anything concerning the matter to

anyone, especially to relatives in Cuba.

Pancrasio stated

this was his second letter (not fourth as indicated on the

material which was forwarded on by ALFONSO) and that the

..first had been sent direct to the AMSCROLL address.

It was

stated this was the first letter by which ALFONSO

would

serve as intermediary and that other letters would come

at infrequent intervals.

Pancrasio had decided to use an

Intermediary address as

the ANSCROLL address was too well

known.

Pancrasio concluded his note by saying that he

preferred to remain anonymous and that he would be remaining

in Cuba for two

In addition to the above cited

message, the letter to ALFONSO contained a calling card with

"UNIDAD" NONTHLY, ISSUE NO. 36, APRIL, 1967.-

(1) ANOTHER REGIME OFTICIAL LELECTS IN GIEAT BRITAR: A brief story on the Colla

so defection, followed by excerpte from his original statement. Excerpts include:

reasons why free world sea trade with Cuba is declining (U.S. Black List, Letin

workers' boycott, etio); Cube-trading shipouners take advantage of Castro and over

charge him for charters; the personnel problem in "Yambisas"; the planned deception

for Expo 67 (exhibiting console record players rade up of foreign components and

wood as Cuban made; general corclusion: régine officiale don't know where they are

haaded for.

(2) EDITORIAL: HATED BY FRIMID AND FOES The Russians hate Castro because he has

two timed them in the Sino Sovict lit; the chisese loathe him bacause they regard

him as a mercenary who has sold out to the Soviets, Latin American Rods hate him

as well, because, as they, say, he has promoted fractionalien in their ranks. Anti-

Commists throughout the Anericas hate him too, as there is not a country in the

hemisphere where mothers and wives are not mourning the loss of a dear one to Cas

troite terrorists.

And anti-Red Cubans would not touch Cestro with a ten-foot pole.

Hated by friend and foe alike, how could anyone think that Castro may eventually

survive a chronic ed nonde crisis that his own ineptitute has wrought on the nation?

PAGE TWO:

(1). MOROCCO BREAKS DEPENDENCE QI CUBAN SUGAR: Fron the EIR we take the story on the

Moroccan plan to develop their. on sugar industry at the expense of purchases from

•Cuba. This plan, we stress, is receiving folish financial and technical ald, which

shows to what extent Castro's Red cotrades are concerned with his sugar interests.

an original and one copy of the study in English and an original

....and one copy in Spanish.

Two sots of the one table and the six

support the study are also being forwarded each

addressee.

this is an Anscion prepared study; the author is

ArRant in collaboration with AuSiiiE-1. It

was prepared in

resposse to references A and B.

We have limited this study to an attempt to provo

statistically the very rapid rise of Cuban economic dependency

upon the Soviet Union.

We have intentionally avoided editorial

Izing as the facts speak for

thenselves; thus we have drawn no

political conclusions, nor have we attempted to establish that

this econonic dependency carries with it an implicit policy

control on the part of the Soviets (partly because policy control

does not necessarily follow and, in any event, the reader is free

to draw his own conclusions).

If it does not run counter to Station Santiago's plans,

we suggest that ANSCROLL - a JINAVE asset that studies

conments upon the

econonic scene.-cproduce this study

under its

name for private distribution to its list of sugar bro

kers, trading firms, and International organizations that deal

ECONCHIC RELATIONS BETSEEN

CUBA AND THE SOVIET UNION:

HOW MUCH DEPENDENCY?

aride integratie

Cuba's dependency on

the Soviet Union is known. The question is: how much de

pendency? In order to arrive

at some conclusion we have chosen Cuba"s foreign trade

statistics for the 1959-1966 period.

We will work under the following economic assumption: Economic dependency of one

country on the other can be indicated to a considerable extent by their trade as this

• Indicates the need one country has of the other as a market for its exports and as

a supplier for its imports.

What we will do is to analyze the Cuban Trade Balance for the 1959-1966 period. *

1) According to the assumption we established regarding trade dependency, we can

say that during 1959 Cuba

was

dependent upon the Free Horld for its markets as total

" trade value for that year amounted to $ 1, 305, 700, 000 and trade value with the Free

World represented

$ 1,289,000,000 (or 98.8% of the total trade).

Broken down into exports and imports we see that in 1959 Cuban exports totaled

$ 637,700,000 while total imports were $ 688,000,000. Thus, the trade balance showed

a $ 26,500,000 deficit, which was a reflection of the trend started in 1958 due to

* Every figure in this paper will be given in U.S. dollars únless otherwise

Indicated The sources for the figures used throughout the analysis, the

•table, and charts were: "The Economist", "The New York Times", UN's Econo

#I Reports on Latin America, "Cuba Comercio Exterior" magazine, "Vision"

magazine, "IS News & World Report", and The Economist Intelligence Unit"s

"Quarterly Economie Review"®

It should be remembered that the figures refer only to the Cuban Trade Ba

..lance, loes, imports and exports, and not to the Cuban Balance of Payments

which would reflect loans and financial arrangements, plus the Soviet mili

tary and techical assistance, figures which do not appear in the balance of

trade and which are not available to us with sufficient authenticity to war

rant their use.

the unstable political situation under the Batista regine and the ecunomic insecurity

of the new Castro regime.

Of the above mentioned exports, 97.8% were to Free World countries and only 2.2%

Of the impoth

to Communist countries, Impost-wise, 99.96 were wade from Free Morid countries, while

Ool% were made from Communist countries.

Thus, ve can conclude that Cuba was stitt very much dependent upon the Free World

as rade wling rautina 1959, Further, at least S 623, 800,000 (97.8% of total exports)

was collected in hard currency.

2) In 1960, Anastas Mikoyan visited Cuba and the Cuban Soviet trade agreement was

signed. The effect of this agreement is immediately apparent when viewed through Cu

ba"s foreign trade figures.

Total trade value decreased in 1960 to S 1,168, 000,000 from $ 1, 305,700, 000. Free

World participation decreased more than proportionately, do the value of Cuban trade

with the Free World was $ 897,000,000, while trade with Communist countries increased

(on 2:2 7 272000,000

(ox 23.3% of total trade) versus $ 1, 289,900,000 and $ 15,800,000

respectively in 1959

The trade balance was in favor of Cuba in the amount of $ 68,000,000 as control

of imports, especially from the Free World, established in 1959 was having its effect.

3) In 1961 the whole foreign trade picture was transformed. It was almost the

reverse of 1960. Total trade amounted to $ 1,253,600,000, of which Free World parti-

cipation represented $ 348,600,000 (or 27.84) and Communist trade $ 905,000,000 (or

72.276)

No can look at this another way. In 1960, Cuban exports earned $ 467,000, 000 in

hard currenty. In 1961, the hard currency earnings amounted to $ 166,800,000 since the

$ 138,100,000 value of tuban exports to the Communist gounties represented agreement

valve" or "nomihal hard currency value" as the trade was conducted under barter agrees

ments, with the Soviet Union providing about 10% to 20% ofthe total Cuban export value

in convertible currency.

Cuba was now dependent, economically, upon the Communist World, especially the

Soviet Union.

The fact that little hard currency was obtained from its new trade part

ners further commited Cuba's economy to the Communist Bloc.)

4) In 1962, the trend continued. Total trade was $ 1,257, 000, 0000 of which

$ 1,031,000,000 (82.18) was with the Communist Bloe and only $ 226,000,000 (17-96)

with Free World countries.

Another phenomenon appeared during 1962. The Sovlets, who had been carefui

not

to press Cuba during 1960 with regards to their trade balance (which was favorable to

Cuba by $ 31,000, 000) were shrewd enough to close the gap during 1961. The balance

was favorable to Cuba by $ 11, 200,000. 3

Clearly, the Soviet pressure was on. In 1962, Cuba faced a $ 227,000,000 defleit

with the Cormunist countries. Compounding this is the fact that by 1962 Cuba had spent

30.6% of its hard currency reserves in Free World markets®

Dependency upon the Soviet Union arrived to stay as trade with the Communist World

represented 82.1% of total trade and imports from the Conmunist area bad for the first

time, surp as sed Cuban exports to the Bloc.

3) Two interesting developments occured in 1963.. First of all, total trade ilth

the Communist countries maintained the 1962 level ($ 1,031,000,000 in 1962 and

$ 1,054,900,000 in 1963). But, the Soviet Union tightened the grip by increasing its

exports to Cuba to $ 688, 900,000 (in 1962 they represented $ 629,000, 000), while Cuban

exports to

the Communist Bloc decreased to $ 366, 000,000 (in 1962 they represented

$ 402,000,000) Thus, the imbalance for Cuba Increased to $ 322,900,000 (in 1962 1t

was $ 227,000,000)

At the same time, Cuba attempted an approach to the Free world markets by taking

advantage of an increase in the price of sugar in the world market (sugar averaged

8.48 ets: per pound during this period). Cuba's total trade with the Free World in

ereased to $ 354, 300,000 (1n 1962 it had been $ 226, 000, 000).

Cislaton

Nevertheless, the 1963/trade balance worsened for Cuba as it showed a $ 323, 200,000

deficit. -The Free Morte cruntrios were able to turn the tables on Cuba. (as in 1962

defect an ith the Free biors,

6) For 1964, a favorable world sugar market (average price of 5.86 ets. per pound)

encouraged

•Cuba to continue its flirtation with the Free Morld. The Cuban treasury

was able to handle some hard currency for the first time in the Castro era and Cuban

cormercial missions were sent to Europe and Japan to purchase items no longer availabl

in Cuba.

Total trade increased to $ 1,722,000, 000 and the Free World participation Increased

from $ 354,300,000 (25.28) In 1963 to $ 612,000,000 (35.6%). The Free World spending

spree took its toll as the trade balance with the Free World

showed a $ 30,000,000 de

ficit for Cuba. And here, we are speaking of a hard currency loss.

Not even in the midst of Cuba's affair with the Free World did the Soviet Union

Lose

Joose control of the situation. On January 20, 1964, Cuba was signing a trade agree-

ment with the Soviet Union by which it was cormiting about half of its planned future

• sugar production to the Soviet Union for the next six years. The amcunts Cuba agreed

to deliver to the Soviet Union were: 2,100,000 metric tons in 1965, 3,000,000 in 19663

4,000,000 1л 19678 4,000,000 1л 1968, 5,000,000 in 19693 and 5,000, 000 in 1970. The

Soviet Union did agree to fix the price of Cuba"s sugar at 6 ets. per pound, which

perhaps seems generous in 1967, but hardly a good offer on January 20, 1964, as the

price of sugar on January 19, 1964 was 9,50 cts. per pound. Adding insult to injury

the Soviet Union did not include in the 1964 trade agreement its previous conritment

to provide Cuba with 10% or 20% of the payments in hard currency as it had done in the

1960 agreemente

7) By 1965 Cuba was sending few trade missions abroad, mirtually ceased its hard

he cann

thad

-currency purchases, and found itself with almost no hard currency (the average price

of sugar had dropped to 2.12 cts. per pound),/ During 1965 Cuba faced the Soviet Urion

more empty handed

than before and

the general trade situation returned to 1963 level

except that by now the Communist countries had more participation and the Free World

had less.

Total trade amounted to § 1,551,000,000 (compared to § 1, 410, 200,000 in

1963), but trade with Cormunist countries reached $ 1,195, 000, 000 (compared to

$ 1,054,900,000 1n 1963) Trade with the Free Korld remained at the same level

- $ 354, 300,000 in 1963 and $ 356, 000,100 in 1965, but sith a difference - the Cu

ban defielt in its trade balance with the Free World rose from $ 300,000 in 1963 to

$ 60,000,000 1n 1965.

So, the Soviets continued in control as trade vith the Communist countries rem

presented more than three quarters of Cuba's total trade for that year. The sugar

production had already been mortgaged, the sugar market was depressed, and Cuba was

more and more dependent upen the Soviet Union.

8) Then came 1966, Sugar prices decreased to an average of 1.86 ets. per pound,

Total trade decreased to $ 1,465,000,100 as compared with $ 1,551,000, 000 in 1965.

mom. Irade with Communist countries also decreased (from $ 1,195, 000,000 in 1965 to

$ 1,160,000,000 in 1966) and the Soviets were able to rush a little further and in

creased Cuba's deficit in the trade balance from $ 119,000,000 in 1965 to $ 200,000,000

In 1966.

Free Worid countries also gained. Total Free World trade decreased to $ 305,000, 000

(from $ 356,000,000 in 1965), but the Cuban deficit increased from $ 60,000,000 in

1965 to $ 65,000,000 in 1966.

Our conclusions follow:

_FIRST: Cuba is economically dependent upon the Soviet Union.

SECOND : This dependency is increasing. It has risen from 1.2% in 1959 to 79.28

by 1966.

To buttress this conclusion we boint out that:

• A) Cuba has mortgaged Its sugar production to the Soviet Union.

B) Cuba has exhausted its hard currency reserves.. While an exact rio

is.

not available we estimated it to be about $ 20,000, 000, in December 1964.

c) Cuba does not receive hard currency from its trade with the Contanist

countries under the present barter agreements.

Nor does this figure include Communist technical assis

THIRD: Cuba has lost Its position at a meaningful trader in the Free World, which

In turn has increased its dependency upon the Soviet, Union.

A. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGITS

1. During the quarter under review ANSCROLL continued Ite

campalgn to discredit the Cuban regime's economie mnagement.

As before, the campaign was conducted by the AUSCrOil, radio

program and by serious econoule studies and comment thet were

provided its mailing list of sugar brokors, selected firns

engage: In international trade and shipping, and commorcial and

tochnical Journale.

The Station continues to be encouragod by

ovidence of increased acceptance of the AUSCROl!, efforts.

For

example, AlSChOLi received eighteen letter from Cuba during this

quarter, all of which were in direct response to the radlo program.

of these, twelve were received in larch which repiesents the

highest monthly total since initiating the program.

This compares

with eleven the previous quarter and

only three In

the corresponding

quarter of 1965.

In January, the Vice President of the Association

of Sugar Producers of Puerto Rico called upon the AUSCO:%.

offices to request ANSCROLL's assistance in preparing & chapter

on Cuban sugar production problems to be included in a book this

AMSCROLL received requests from four univeral-

tles or colleges requesting vritten mterial, fron a graduate

student preparing a thesis on the lot of the

Cuban peasant, from

the U.B. Army Special Warfare School iibrary, and others.

The

wire services, particularly Associated Prese

last

quarter-daily except Sunday for ten minutes over ANTHIGH..

In addition,

on 1 January ANSCROLL began a thirteen minute

program each Sunday on AuTHIGH.

These prograns are in large part

confined to subjects of an economic nature with the time on

Sunday devoted to an in-depth analysis of what has occurred in

this area since the previous Sunday.

Typical themes hit through

out this quarter vere: Economie and sociological aspects of

Throughout this period and

"honever possible a particular

effort was made to relate

developments in China to present or posalble developments in

Cuba.

The difficulties of

the Chinese economy provided

examples to which & Cuban "twist' could be put; e.f., the

Chinese and Cuban ocononic failures demonstrate the failure of

demonstrates that Great Britain 18 now gotting the botter part

of the bargain; this story was tilod by

the poor quality of molasses being soid by the Cubans to British

11rms.

Finally, ANSChOiL continued to get mileage from the

Damller-Benz story by reporting that this Gernan firm has finally

rofused to sell spare parts to Cuba; the story was filed by ArP

and publiahed at least by Diario las Anoricas.

5.

A recent development which may have an interesting ..

operational potentlal was a telephone call to AUSCROL: {rom

sarnirow londs, the New York sugar brokers, which vag

trimered by an AMSCIOLL "case study" of the problems being

tacod by a Cuban sugar mill.

The firn told AUSCIO!., that 1f has

for some time suspected Cuban sugar production figures and

wondered 1f AUSCROlL had any such suspicions.

AuschOlL (through

ANFRAMS-1) has written to say it would be most interested in

following any loads from Czarnikow-Ronda that could support a

conolusion that Cuban production figures are false, which 1e

whero this matter now Iles.

The officials of Carnikow-Rionde

are vll know to AUSCROLL and we shall be interested in seeing

what the firm developes for AMSCROLI.

1.

The AMKNOT organization continued during the quarter

mariners who have defected from their service.

•Fifteen diff

erent cases vere handled durlug this period which included

IIve resettlement cases in areas other than IMMAVE.

The remaining eight received assistance in obtain-

obtaining the necessary U.8. Coast Guard certification is slow

and of the four that applied for this during the previous quarter

only two had received the certificationk the end of the current

quarter. During this quarter two nore former Cubar merchant

officers sought through ANKNOT this certification as they expressed

Interest 1 ISTS employment.

The current status is:

In process 6;

Coast Guard certificationa received-2; physical examinations given

In addition, applications for employment together

with the Coast Guard certifications and completed physical examin

3.

The activities of the ANKNOT organization continue to

The Station has four clips from different

papers including one fron El Universal of Caracas.

ANKNOT issued

one prese release during this quarter-which was an "eyewitness"

account of the attempt of four Cuban sailors to obtain political

B. ADMINIBTRATION

4, The AMNOT organization remains constituted

as reported

in the previous fuarterly Report.

However,

in December AMASK 1

was offered a pernanent position as personnel director of a local

shoe company that employs some four hundred people. His starting

salary will be $475.00 per month which will be lacreased riter

the firet three months and increased again after the second three

beat and tore

montbs.

The Station concurred with AMASE-T that he accept. for

these reasons:

It appears that AMASK-1 w111 be

terminated when AMKNOT 1a closed,

(3) this position should solve AlASk-l's personal financial prob

lens, and (4) AMASK has agreed to remain as chairman of ANKNOT

wIthout salary and to continue to lend his name to the organization.

The Station oxpects to replace AMASk-] with AMPOLISH] who appears

qualifled to handle the hand-holding and housekeeping aspects of

AKKNOT •

AMPOLISH-1 1a presently employed by a local

automobile

dealer

and is able to take the necessary time off to handle the

AMKNOT matters.

We see three advantages to this development:

(1) The Station will be spared a possible disposal situation when

ANKNOT 1e closed (1t hag been made clear to AHPOLISH»] that this

1o a temporary assignment that at the most will last for a few

(2) We have offered AMPOLISH-I $200,00 per month versus

monthal for AHASKel, and (3) AMASK-, should be 1a an excellent

position to offer at least temporary employment in the shoe fac

tory to marinera to come.

5.

An estimated total of $2,505.00 was spent during this

quarter.

This anount represents AMASK-1's salary and allowances,

office expenses, and English Instruction for those seeking ISTS

enployment.

Espenses by month were:

October,

$855.00; November,

$825.00; and December (estinated), $825.00.

The allotment for

this activity for the quarter was

$3, 000.00.

PROBLEMS

gration and Naturalization Service over the lack of proper documen-

tation to re-enter the country.

may not have heard the last from him; AMASk-1

recently received a letter from

which said that

was about to sue the shipping line that had employed him for back

salary and loss of personal effects that L

claima the captain

had locked up.

AMASK-1 was advised to ignore the letter in view

of the difficulties already caused and in view of his potential for

further trouble (see paragrapha 2 and 3 of JMWAVE-3990).

his duties with AMINOT on 2 January 1967 as this is the date

Alasket will join the shoe company.

ANKNOT will continue pro-

cassins arplications of those interested in MSTS employment and

In addition the AMLIRA organization provided

and Bouth America.

B.

ADMINISTRATIVE

During the socond quarter of IT 67 the AMLIRA organzation

expended $17,300 and had income of sone $600 fron news stand sales

and advertising.

Both these figures are approximate projections

because the final December figures are not recorded at this

writing.

The net figure for expenditures during the quarter (some

$10,700) exceeds the budgeted amount by approximately $400. However,

this overage will be absorbed in further budgetary cutbacks during

the neut reporting period.

6. Tho AMLIRA activity expendituren also exceeded the budget

allowance during the laat quarter.

To renedy this situation the

following specifie economy measures vill go into effect begloning

I January 1967:

•• One malaried enployoe will be dropped.

It is expected that there will be other savings which will briag

5.

During the second quarter of FX-67 there were expendi

tures of approximately $19,000 by the AMSTRUT-2 activity.

This

figure includes an estimate for the month of December because

the final Iigures lave not been received at this writing.

The

budgeted anount for AMSTRUI-? for the quarter 1e $24, 000 and there

18 an excess of budget authorization over expenditures of approzi

mately $5000.

This figure, however, gives an unreel budgetary

picture of the ALSTHUT-2 activity.

This $5000 w111 remnin as a

part of the budget allotment and may well be expended in a flurry

of AMSTRUT-2 travel, publication activity and or promotion during

• tha next quarter.

In other worda the excess docs not represent

budget. "fat" since the bulk of toe AMSTRUT-2 expenses are not

figured an month to month constants but obligated as the operational

altuntion demends.

6. During December AHSTRUT-2 moved into a smaller house with

• lower rent which wild mean a saving of $100 per month.

addition, it 1s anticipated that a further saving will be realised

in mintenance and upkeep costs.

Go PROBLEMS

The basle agent handling problem presented by AMSTRUT-?'s

excessive generosity and understandable

enotlonal approach to

mercurta! dispos1t1o0, he role which mat be played before the pub

11c still exists.

However, It seems to have lessened somewhat as

ANSTRUT? gaine confidence

in the language and in dealings with the

public.

There 1s little question that a contributing factor to the

lessening of this problem is the reliance placed by AWSTRUT-2 on

AMLYRIC] who serves as business advisor, buffer and hand holder.

B.

The problen of projecting the imge of the AMSTRUT-? Founda-

tion as an independent charitable organization remains.

The appli-

cation for tax enempt status to the state of regiatry

is in the works

and when this application is approved it 1. likely that there will be

an increase of private donations which, because of the new statue, will

be tax deductible.

The problem lies in the dilatory behavior of the

state authorities.

AMSTRUT-2 contimes to be attractive to certain extremist

politiesi groupe whose patriotic claims of objectives would often

appear to parallel those of AMSTRUT-? and the Cuban extle community

as & whole.

AMSTRUT-2 has not always been able to sort out the "good

guys" from

the "bad guys"

and the problem lies in fending off these

extremiat groups and preventing then from exploiting AMSTEUT 3

for

partisan political ends.

(Letters Regarding Greek Shipping and Cuba

ACTION REQUIREN - REFERENCES

Action: FYI

economic research unit of ANSCROLL has throughout the past

year received

seven anonymous letters from Athens.

These letters

describe in detail Greek and Lebanese shipping with Cuba and appear

to have been written by someone knowledgeable of his subject.

The

author apparently has access to ANSCROLL publications as he makes

reference

to "your circulars".

We forward a set of these lett.rs

by separate covor as they may

be of interest and of possible use.

The AiSCROLL shipping studies have made a veiled acknowledgment of

receipt of this

material by referring to information received.from

friends in Greece; however, AbSCRoLL has used

only those facts that

we can check out here.

AS

indicated on certain of the letters

copies of various ones have been sent to the "Ministry for Foreign

Affairs, Washington"; the U.S. Ambassador; London; or the U.S.

Ambassador, Athens. A copy of the last letter received by ANSCROLL was

sent all three.

Dear Dr. Rivas-Vasquez:

In response to your letter of November 19th, concerning

Greek and Lebanese shipping to Red Cuba ports, I am enclosing

some information I have obtained which should fulfill your

requirements.

In the case of the Lebanese Directives, you

will note that no specific reference is made to shipping to

Cuba®

Despite the fact that the enclosed information is not

elessified or restricted, it was obtained from a sensitive

source and I would appreciate it if you would handle this

matter discreetly.

We have been very pleased with the information your

orgenization has been providing us concerning shipments to

Cuba.

I hope tha: the data provided will be helpful to you.

SUGAR

An the Cuban representative to the International Sugrr Council I was able

tó obaerve at firet hand sone of the problems facing the Cuban sugar Industry,

Some observations follows

Interantional Aspests

It to well known that all countrids that import or produce sugar are mitre

efforts

towardo reaching & long-term Sugar Agreemnt that vould stabilize and

solve the

critical situation in the world market of over supply and low price.

Castro's stand to that respect has

been to boycott and undermine such offorts.

Thisi has been clearly reflocted 1n Castro's refusal to participate In the

work coups that have been created for that purpose under the sponsor

ahip of the Secretary General of UNCTAD, Ds. Raul Probish.

Castro belloves that by not participeting in efforte to reach a

Sugar A

greement he can cause the collapse of the mgar industries in the lese efficient

producer countries In order to bring economic hardship to those countries in

tin linerica to which sugar exporte are Important.

Castro'a ultimite and,

courto, la to cause Internal disturbances in these countries and thue to ripen

them for Caatro comuglet subversion;

'This has béen a boomerang to Cuba®

The

hoped-for sconano disanter in the Latin American nattons has not occured. In

Btead»

it is occurring in Cubt. The regime

1a unable to mot its announced

goale (the

goal for

the sugar year 1966 was 6,500, 000 tons whereas 4,455,255

were actually harvested).

To move Its sugar, Cuba has been forced to grant spo

clal discounts, for example to Japan,

and to Great Britain.

This further com

Intarmial Aspects

The blows recelved by fuba'a sugar econouy from the hurricanes and droughte

are nothing compared to the damage caused by the improvisation and Incompetency

of those who today, niamanage our country's affairs.

The

shortage of manpower

for

cutting the cane, the enlistment of inexperienced folunteer" cane cutters,

the fallure

of combine machines from the-ISR, and the doteriorating altuation

In the transportation of the cane crown the eisting economie anarchy.

The régime has been committed by Castro to produce 10, 0U0, 000 tons of sugar

1o 1970, which figure sugar economists in and out of Cube agree 1s most unlkely

However, the attempt to reich this goal is resulting In actlulties that amount

to econonde suicide.

Cuba 1a buying generators In England costing more than one

dillon dollars which will be used to provide power for the "Centros de Acopio"

(reception centers).

The

concept of these centers was tried rany years ago in

Cuba and discarded as both inefficient and uneconomical. There is no reason to

belleve that arything has happened that will change this. So, what to do with

the generators?

One might conclude a discussion of Cuba's sugar problems with the observa

ton that never before In Cuba's

economie

history

has so much discussion, so

many speeches, and so much activity resulted in such a loas of effectivenesa.

This "international solidarity" practiced by Commnist countries kept Cabe,

for a long tina. (1962-1963) from entering Western European rarketo.

Dumping as practiced by these countries,

the lack of adequate stocka for

the Europeans® taste,

difficulties and delays in deliveries (due to shortage of

ships) have made the Europeans shy avay from buying larger quantities of Cuban

leaf,

and,

many European Importers have learned that Cuba is not a reliable

Because of various.

in tho JANAVE aros.

It was agreed that the JAVE exfle group

would furnish the material directly to ldeutity, with a copy

to QUSPOT -2, who, after reculpt of the orticle, would them

approach the cirectors of Identity to ascertain the price

of the article and push for its publication.

ECONONICAS DE UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA.-

LA CALIDAD ACTUAL DEL AZUCAF CUBANO

Por el Ingeniero Raúl Esparza Tabares

ex Director de Investigaciones Tecno-

16gicas del Ministerio del Azúcar (MINAZ) de Cuba Comunista

Este breve análisis de la calidad actual del azúcar cubano va dirigido tanto al

perito en azúcares (como paso inicial de lo que podría convertirse en un estudlo mas

técnico y exhaustivo) como al lector ordinarlo, toda vez que, en Cuba, el azúcar

•cast sinónimo

de rrosperidad económica, y asi,

la calidad del

azúcar desempeña.un pa

pel de gran importancia

en la situación económica global del pais (1).

Sin mas comentarios o notas de Introducción, ofrecemos a continuación el análi-

sis de la calidad actuál del azúcar cubano

lo Materias. Extrañass

a) Azúcar, crudor la Industria azucarera cubana

se caracterizaba por recibir pa"

ra su procesamiento, la mejor calidad de caña de azúcar en cuante a su contenido de-

materias extrañas (menos del 3), Actualmente y por causa de los trabajadores " ve

luntarios" por un lado y por otro a la mecanización de la cosecha de la caña, las ma-

terías extranas que acompañan a la caña al llegar al Central para su procesamiento

ha aumentado al 8% en el caso de los voluntarios y al 19% en el caso de las máquinas

de cortar caña soviéticas. Es: de. señalarse que dentro de la composición de estas ma

• terias extrañas está incrida la tierra, y como quiera que las tierras de Cuba tienen

en su comnostelón un alto contenido de arcillas, estas son muy difíciles de eliminar

en el proceso tecnológico de purificación y afectan grandemente la calidad del azú

car CrU0O.

b) Azúcar Refino, Las materias extrañas, principalmente arcillas de las tierras

llegan hasta el azúcar refino dándole color al mismo y dejando residuos insolubles

al ser disueltas esta azúcar. Esto disminuye la calidad del azúcar refino no sola a

mente para el consumo humano directo, siro que ocasiona graves perjuicios en los in-

dustrias de alimentos que utilizan el azúcar refino. Lo mismo sucede con las indus=

trias de refrescos.

.(1) No es necesario ensalzar la calidad del azúcar cubano que producía antes de

•astro, ya que su prestigio en el mercado mundial es un hecho de sobra con

cido.

Lo mismo puede decirse de los técnicos cubanos en azucar con quie

nes los expertos internacionales han tenido amplia oportunidad de discutir

104 asuntos anucareros a interesnal tulles y sugesenetas ilbramente. Esta

sItuación ya no existe

2. Polarización:

a) Azúcar crudo, En époças anteriores al regimen comunista, Cuba no moducto alú-

cares crudos con polarizaciones menores de 97.0 a 97:5 %, y para muchos mercados

tranjeros se roducían azúcares crudos con polarizaciones superlores a 98.0%*

En la

actualidad un perelento significativo de la producelõri no alcanza esos valores, dán:

dose casos de azúcaros crudos con polarizaciones de 96.0 y 95.0 %

b) Azucar Refinos las calidades mejores de azúcares refinos o blancos se

en los mercados internaclonales principalmente por su grado de polarización, la

deberá ser como mínimo 99.9% Los azúcares refinos en la actualidad bajo el reginep

a) Azúcar Crudo: El contenido de materias insolubles en el azúcar crudo ha aumenta

do aproximadamente en un 250% debido a la mala purificación de los Jugos de

la caña que van a parar hasta el azúcar.

b) Azúcar Reling, El uso de azúcares erudos de baja calidad, la deficiente calidad

del Acido Fosfóstico,

viados por los países comunistas, han tenido

como consecuencia un aumento del porcenta

do considerablemente la calidad de estos ázúcares refinos.

5 • Colos:

a) Azúcar Crudo: El Índice de colos de los azúcares crudos ha aumentado casi en un

las refinerías.

b) Azúcar Refing, Este es uno de los, factores importantes en la calldad de los azú

a la ausencia east total de técnicos con experiencia, y a la baja calidad de los mate

d) Envasegs Los envases que viene utilizando el régimen comunista en los azúca -

Londreso Yo había salido de Cuba el 23 de febrero de 1946 dejando atrás a mi seño

ra y a mis dos hijos, uno de los cuales, Raúl, se encontraba enfermo de hepatitio.

en La Habana

MI señora tuvo que tomar la decisión sin encontrarme yo a su lado, pero habla

que aprovechar la oportunidad que se presentaba y salir por la vía clandestina del

naís. De la odisea puoden dar detalles ellos mucho nejor ana yo y posiblemente los

miembros de la prensa desearán hacerles algunas preguntas al final de mis palabras.

Muy brevemente los diré oue ellos se sometleron al mismo proceso que tantos .....

otros cubanos se han sometido, es decir, lanzarse en bote a srugar el "corredor de

la muerte" con la confianza que Dios los ayudarla a arribar a tierras de libertado

Dos intentos fallaron pero por fin, el tercer intento fue un éxito y al menos el

grupo completo, unas veinte personas, se montaron en el bote y pusieron proa a los

Estados Unidos, el motor se rompló y la travesía fué la mayor parte del tiempo a

vela al cabo de casi dos días el agua y la escasa comida se habfan açotado y en

conces apareció un huaue eriano que desprás de facilitarles agua y algunos alla

mentos lo comunicó al Seruielo de Guardacostas de los Estados Unidos y poco desa

prés en solla Catalla idiolio souse el luyas y rarcaba el sitio faro facilitarle

-la tarea-a-una-de sus unidades navales que ya se encontraba en camino.

La llegada del buque del Servicio de Cursarostas Norteamericano fué real

mente providencial, pues mi familia y los otros tripulantes. del bote observaban

aterrorizados como por la nopa se acercaba velozmente una ¡lancha patrullera cuba»

na, que al ver el buque norteamericano viró en redondo y regresó a Cuba.

Yo mo encontraba en el hotel en Londres y una llamada de larga distancia me

puso al corriente de la situación. Ellos se encontraban a salvo y ahora ne toca-

Da el turno a mí.

Lallamada Informándome del arribo de mi familia: a los EE.lU, llegó precisam

mente cuando me encontraba reunido con el resto de los miembros de la Delegación.

Estos me observaban atentamento, como querieren adivinar lo que se no decía des-

de el otro lado de la línea. Por tanto, tuve que desplegar mis escasas dotes

de

actor teatral y simular que la llamada era oficial desde Cuba.

Anto esta situación, optó por informas, falsamente, a los restantes deiega

dos que el gobierno cubano me había encargado el cuidado de otros asuntos, por

lo que tendría que demorarme algunos días mas de los previstos en Madrid.

Los dije también que me reservaran pasaje a bordo del vuelo de la semana el

culente y les entregué

una carta para mi familia. Llegué a Madrid el A de Mar-

80. Las autoridades españolas me brindaron toda clase de facilidades, incluso

posteriormente la de ofrecerme hasta protección personal, puesto que cuando en el

MINAZ se conoció mil desaparición, el gobierno notificó a las embajadas cubanas en

Londres y Madrid que me encontraran y que me llevaran de regreso para La Habana

aunque tuviera que ser a bordo de un buque cubano y por supuesto, en contra de mi

voluntado

- No deseo tomar mas tiempo para anécdotas personales y si lo he hecto ha 8i-

do porque estimo que ayudan a comprender la verdadera situación que se vivo en

Cuba. La situación de los funcionarios que como en mi caso, desean la libertad

de nuestra Patria, y que nos encontramos sujetos a vigilancia, a represión, mis

Mijos expulsados de la Universidad y sujetos a las mismas privaciones que el reg

to de nuestro Pueblo.

Pasemos ahora al tema principal de esta conferencia, que es a la vez la es

pina dorsal de la econemía cubana y por tanto el factor determinante de la es

tabilidad o de la caída del régimen de Fidel Castro: el AZUCAR.

En relación con el estado de la Industria azucarera en la actualidad es no.

cesarlo comenzar por esbozar la situación en la que se imitan ido lirios.

--Debido-a-la escasez de niezas de repueste, la falta de materiales y la baja call

dad del trabajo, los ingenlos confrontan una situación que es necesario califi ..

car de "caótica". La falta de personal técnico capacitado y de obreros especia

lizados hacen que la operación de producción de los ingenios sea altamente defl

ciente. Por otra parte, la falta de abastecimiento de caña no permite que 108'10

génios funcionen a su capacidad normal, trayendo como consecuencia poca eficien

cia en el trabajo y un alto consumo de combustible adicional, que ocasiona un ay

mento considerable en los costos de producción del azúcar. En relación con los

medios de transporte, rincipalmente los ferrocarriles azucareros, deseamos acla

rar que se encuentran también en pésimas condiciones, a pesar de la adquisición

de locomotoras souléticas, inglesas y francesas, pues las vías férreas no permi

ten el aprovechamiento de este material rodante. Por ejemplo, durante 1965 se

debían de haber cambiado sois millones de traviesas en las vías férreas, mas sin

embargo sólo había diponibles ochenta mil. El resultado es el incremento de los

descarrilamientos que durante la zafra de 1969 alcanzaron un promedio de tres des

carrilamientos diarios, produciendose diez accidentes mortales.

Muchos me preguntan cual será la producción final de la zafra de 1966 y so

bre este punto debo hacer los comentarlos siguientoss Fidel Castro anunció que

la meta azucarera de este año serían 6.5 millones de toneladas y ese anuncio no

sólo fue hecho durante su discurso del Iro. de mayo de 1955, sino que lo repitió

durante su discurso del y de Junio del mismo año. Sin embargo, se admito que di

cha metá no será alcanzada. Ahora bien el estimado actual no excede de 5.1 mi

llones de toneladas.

¿Por qué?

Primeramente se debe mencionar la falta de abono. Este año la aplicación

..do abono fue insignificante, pues el gobierno no tenía las divisas necasarias par.

ra adquirirlo, principalmente en Italia.

El año pasado, sin embargo, se aplica-

---

## Page 202

son aproximadamente 450,000 toneladas.

En segundo lugar, resulta necesarlo hacer referencla à las sombras de caña.

Las nuevas areas sembradas de caña lo han sido de forma deficiente y además se han

utilizado

areas destinadas con anterioridad a la siembra de otras cosechas para.

sembrar caña, como lo constituye, Dor sólo citar un ofenio, el caso de la zona -

situada en los alrededores de Manzanillo y Bayamo, las cuales eran zonas arroco

ras y ahora han intentado convertirlas en zonas cañoras, resultando todo esto en

un fracaso pues la caña es de baja calidad al no sos adecuado el suelo.. Otro fas

tor menos importante poro digno de darse a conocer es la falta de cuidado en las

tareas de cultivo y atención de los cañaverales debido a la escasez de mano de 2

bras

Con estos antecedentes es que hay que analizar el monto de la presente zafra.

Durante 1965 el día y de abril se alcanzó el cuarto millón, pero este año el ter.

cer millón se alcanzó el día 3 de abril lo cual ya significa un atraso de cerca

de 900,000 toneladas. Creo que hay caña para llegar a 5.1 millones de toneladas

ahora bien, lo que hay que preguntarse es si dicha mota, que ya está bastante: por

dobajo de los 6.5 millones anunciados por Fidel Castro será alcanzada o no. El

Partido está realizando una movilización masiva record hacia los cañaverales con

el propósito de intentar cortar toda. la caña pero eso hay que ver si en defini-

tiva lo logran hacer.

Cabe hacer referencia en este momento a lo que se conoce en Cuba por el nog

bre de "pian Perspectivo Azucarero", que es el único plan económico que tiene en

estos momentos el gobierno de Cuba.

¿Qué es el "Plan Perspectivo Azucarero"' comprende tres puntos básicos que

son los siguientess primero, la "rehabilitación" de la capacidad industrial a ni

veles pre-Castros segundo, la "ampliación" de la capacidad industrial, y tercero,

la "concentración" de la Industria azucarera en 70 modernos centrales.

Vamos a tevisar brevemente los tres puntos a la luz de la presente situación.

En relación con el primero, o sea, la "sehabilitación" de la capacidad Industrial...

instalada, es necesario destacar que en 1952 la capacidad de producción de la in

dustrla azucarera era de siete millones de toneladas, pero debido a la escasez

de piezas de repuesto, falta de materiales para las reparaciones,. baja calidad de

las roparaciones y la eliminación de seis ingenios - que fueron precisamente des

mantelados para utilizar las plezas como repuestos lo cual ea ha comprobado ha 51

do un error más - la capacidad industrial se ha reducido a sólo seis millones de

toneladas, es decio, que la actual política ha resultado en la presente merma de

la producción ¡qué progreso! Fidel Castro no ha podido ni alcanzar la capael e

---

## Page 203

dal de reducción azucarera nue Cuta tenía hace nuince años.

El segundo punto, que en cierto sentido debe atemnerarse al primero, es am=-

ollar la canacidad industrial Instalada y ademis construir un nuevo ingenio. Esto

significaría, o sea, para alcanzar esto serfa necesario la importación da un núme

maro considerable de enuipos-para los incentos, cosa totalmente imposible de lle

varse a cabo debido a la escasez de divisas de por sí escasas para la adquisición

de piezas de repuesto- y la falta de técnicos para hacerse cargo de sucervisar y

@jecutar dicha ampliación - también se dete decir que tampoco son suficientes los

técnicos para tealizar de por sí las labores ordinarlas de la zafra con la actual'

capacidado Este parte del plan supone una coordinad ón entre el INA - que sien.

bra la caña - y el MiNaz, pero lo ole sucede en la realidad es que no están en

coordinación ambos organismos y por consiguiente el INRA manda a sembrar cara en

donde no existe canacidad industrial y por su parte el MINAZ está "rehabilitando"

ingentos en donde a lo mejor ya no hay suficiente caña. Esto es sólo una muestra

de la desorganización reinante, desorganización que unida a los factores, menciona

dos Imposibilitan el éxito del "Plan Perspectivo". Esto es una prueba más de la.

incapacidad de la planificación econónica de las altas esferas en dicho gobierno.

(Por cierto que la construcción del nuevo ingento es vital para el éxito del

"Plan" y hasta el momento presente sílo una firma francesa ha hecho ofertas para

dicha construcción, dicha firma es nada menos que la FIVES-LILLE, bien conocida

en los círculos azucareros).

La tercera fase del "plan", es decir, la "concentracón" de la capacidad in

dustrial azucarera en setenta ingenios después de 1970 es sólo un sueño en la men

te de los planificadores. La regresión constante de la industria azucarera no

puede permitis, económicamente hablando, el modernizar y automatizar plantas y

equipos, hasta que los problemas económicos básicos de la producción no estén re-

sueltos.

Los equipos soviéticos no son aptos para realizar estas tareas agrícolas en -

Cuba y su diseño y diffell

operación impiden que cumplan su cometido. Aderas es

das "cortadoras" introducen un 1986 de materias extrañas en el ingenio, lo cual --

ocasiona gran desgasto a las máquinas y equipos del ingenio. Y es procisamente

con estos equipos soviéticos con los cuales se contaba para cosechar 83 millones

de toneladas de caña que serían necesarias para producir los 10 millones de tone

ladas de azúcar anunciados por Fidel Castro como los "10 megatones de azúcar" con

los que iba a derrotar al "Imperialismo' en 1970.

Las metas de producción del "Plan" son las siguientes, Para 1965: 6 millones

de toneladase para 19668 E.5 millones! para 1967s 7.5 millones- para 1968: 8 i=-

Alones: para 1969, 9 millones: y finalmente, para 1970: 10 millones de toneladas

de azúcar. Estimo que el único en Cuba que aún creo en el "Plan" y en sus metas

es Fidel Castro®

No gustaría hacer una breve referencia en relación con otro problema básico

- la baja calidad del azúcar cubano, tanto crudo como refino, actualmente en proce

so de empeorarse. Esto no ha sucedido de casualidad sino como consecuencia de la

• falta y mala calidad de las piezas de repuesto, la ineficiencia en la operación de

los Ingenios, la falta de eficiencia de los trabajadores, y la baja calidad de 10s

productos químicos auxiliares procedentes de países socialistas. Estos problemas

están resultando en una decreciente polarización del azúcar, el envase deficiento

del azúcar de exportación, el aumento de impurezas en el azúcar embarcada a granel,

y las dificultades en cumplir los compromisos de entregas de azucares.

Otro tema de Interés lo constituye la presencia de los "técnicos azucareros"

soviéticos en Cuba. El régimen cuenta en la actualidad con unos 300 técnicos azu

careros soviéticos quienes se supone que sean los sustitutos de los técnicos cuba

nos que han abandonado el país. Los técnicos soviéticos tienon muy poca experien

cla en azúcar de caña y la forma en que dicha industrla opera en Cuba. Además muy

pocos hablan español

y esto les hace aún más difícil su labor. Por lo tanto ni los

técnicos soviéticos ni los equipos soviéticos constituyen una solución para el que.

bradero de cabeza azucarero de Fidel Castro.

Con esto deseo dar por terminada estas declaraciones. Dejo ahora la palabra a

los miembros de la prensa para contestarles cualquier pregunta en relación, no só-

10 a mis palabras, sino a la situadi ón política interna que es un interesante fenó

meno de desintegración, la odisea de

mi familia, el problema de la Universidad en

donde desempeñaba una cátedra, así como cualquier otro tema que resulte de interés.

Muchas gracias.

Dear Prof. Gardlunds

I am pleased to enclore the information that you requested

In your kind lotter of 5/5/66, which I hope will be userul to you in your studies

of price and cost trends in the cano sugar industry.

As you probably know, the Curan suras industry ranked Mrst

placo as a producor of cone

sugar, not only with rogards to largo production vol

ames, but also as concerns high technical efficiency and low produotion costs.

Beforo 1959, the maximan production cost was of 3.5 cente a

round, excopting, of course,

the smallor and moro inofficiont sugar midis that

had not dovolopod any tochnologienl advanços since world war It.

However, in

1965 the coat of production was as high as 5.25 cente a pound, even though, of

course, this latter fisure la carerully concealod by the Communist regims that

rulos my country.

I would like to acquaint you with the Economic Research Bu

reau of the UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA Moromont.

This organiantion 1s mado up of true

Suban oconomiato in exilo. I am sura that

you will find this a very valuable

source of information concerning Cuba's economy.

I thank you very much for the kind and humane phrases that

you havo had for my family and for myself.

Thank Heaven, after throe long years

wo wore able to escapo, oven if at the risk of our own lives, from the Communist

holl. We have como to

this froe land in the hope that we can start our lives all

ovor again under the kind hospitality of this groat Nation, the free and denocrat

le Uhited Statos of America.

Ploase by assured, my dear Professor,, that I am pleased to

place mysels at your service.

Should you desire any informtion concerning the

Cuban sugar industry, I will be more than glad to furnish it to you.

nope that, very soon, a rogimo of lihorty, justice and democratio econonio de

valopmant will prevail in my suffering Fathorland.

Sincerely yours,

Ing. Raul Esparsa S.

November 3, 1965: "Hou Abject Can Castro Hel".- In his recont statement to three

Amerionn and one Spanish journalisto, Cratro appears arrorant and acte as though he

didn't care for an "agglornamonto' with the U.".

Howover, from the context of hie

strtoments it Is quite obvious thit he would like nothing botter than boing redmit

spoken out through Carlon Rafael Rodriguez, following the dovastating, "purge" that 1t

"now wave" are really a think of the pact, why does Old-Guard man Carlos Rafpel now

bring up the fret that Fidel was not one of them at the leginning, and that he was

not a true Marxist- Leniniat?.

Novenber 4e 1965: "The Renction to Camarlock: Chatro's Resentment and Bitterneeß".-

Castro's vow to let diseatisfied

ident Johnson took the challenge and then Cartro tried to sound out the U.'. for co

has uncovered that Fidel Cartro has croater the objoctivo conditiono for fractional

work within the Party with the exclucion of the Old Guard and of the Stulents Diroe-'

torate from the oxecutive bodies of the Party. This revonlr 1 state of internal

rift and decomposition, and such rovolation, coming from a cigrifleant Old Guard

source ruch as Rodriguez, foretsile rather unproictable consequences.

parting with Red China, an' un'er trutal soviet pressure, Castro's Nov. 7 speech

inaugurating a hospital sounds like that of a "conatructive" ruler whose concern 1s

for the wolfnre of the people, and who arks that eame people "to march up the (socia-

list) path".

He is no longer arromnt. Ho belatedly begs for the people's support.

Wht About Latin American Comrunist Partles?".- Castro dismissed the fact that

Chim did not groet the roorminization and chango of the Cuban Communist iarty, but

spite and concern were obvious in the tone of his voice. Cas'ro knows that re has

botrayed Chinn. On the other hand, the Communist Parties

of latin Amorica have not

addrorced Cratro any conpratul-tory messages either, which indicates that they are

beginning to turn their backs on him on account of his "purging" of the old guard.

Under such conditions, Cartro's subservience to loscow is grenter every day. Castro

has entored the most unsurnountable phase of his crisis.

Nov. Ith speech it may be deducted that the U.s.i.R. has only been able to supply him

with weapone, bullets and cannons. We stato the reasons why the U...r.R. will not be

ablo to invest more in Cubs, and that, at the same time, the nations of this Hemisp

here will continue thoir economic boycott of Castro's Cuhr. There can be no economie

coexistence between Red Cubs and the rest of the Continent.

"Continental Resistance to Argression".- Even though the Lima meting of military

chiefe from 17 American countries did not trke up the question of the Inter American

Army, the nesembled chiefs unquestionably took a step towards its establishment, which

will be ultimately decided on by the ?.1.i. Aggression to the Doninican Re:ublle,

"The O.A.i. Should Not Postpone Its Meeting".- The same Castroite agression that.

earlier forced the postponement of the 0.1.:. Conference now warrants that the Conference

Instrurents and agencies to put the O.A.S. in stape to face up to the subvercive threat

October 19: "The Indonesian leople Against the Communists" - This artl.

cle breaks Cuban

deadly silence concerning Indonesian

events, and suf

marizes and, comments such

events, emphasizing that the people and the

armed forces have performed the miracle of recovering democracy for Indo

nesia. HISTORIC DETERMINISM turns against Communism, first in the Domin-

1can Republic, next in Algeria, now in Indonesia, and tenorrow in Cuba.

"Why Doesn't Fidel Talk of the Farty's Reorganization?" - Right after the

news on the reorganization of the Party were confirmed, Castro offered to

let all dissatisfied Cubans out of the country, Among other things, this

offer served as a smoke screen to cover the purge which he had carried

out. Then, complete silence on the subject, so that no one would realize

that the Party has been placed under his absolute personal control. He

fears the reaction of the purged old Commies.

October 20: "Latin America Against Communism", - The Venezuelan Dock

workers? Convention in Caracas, which had an international character, put

out Resolutions in which the workers of the Americas confirm their deter

mination to fight communism.

"The Arrival of the Pro-Consul". Gromyko's trip to Cuba is more than just |

a visit by the Soviet Foreign Minister: 1t is an unannounced inspection

tour by the Fro-Consul to his Caribben colony. Of course, tile trip can

bring nothing good for Fidel.

October 21: "Why 1s Gromyko in Havana?" - Gromyko, breaking all rules of

denocracy, showed up in Havana. What for? Among the other problems faced

by Cuba, he showed up to solve the crisis undergone by the Cuban Comunist.

"The Fussled Cheat", - Castro's "oper-door" offer, which was just a bluff

which he hoped would not be accepted, has caught Fidel in a series of

traps shich he has laid himself. He has had to take resource to a thousand

gimmicks and buts in

order to keep Cuba from losing its

entire population,

but he has been unable to keep Camarioca from becoming a plebiscite of

hostility agrinst his regime.

October 22: "Fidel Castro's Despair" - After he was abandoned by the of

ficers and soldiers of the kebel Army, by the militia and by the people

of Cuba in general, Castro tries to seek refuge in the support of the

youth, which he flatters constantly to that end. If it 1s true that

Cuba!s joung people support Castro, ve challenge him to allow draft-age

youths to leave the country if they wish.

"Che's Letter in Cuban Schools". Castro has ordered that Che's letter

be read and re-read in Cuban schools. The letter, which seems to have

been dictated by Fidel while his victim stood with a foot in the grave,

is a carbon copy of Stalin's procedures. Stalin also demanded that the

"purged" leave letters which he himself dictated, in order to instill the

cult to his personality in the minds of children and form the myth of his

own genius. Castro forgets that such Stalinist methods are still too re-

cent and much discredited.

October 33: "Gromyko and Castro's Woes".- This article emphasises

Castro's deer concern over Gromyko's sudden appearance in Cuba, which

indicates that the Soviet Pro-Consul dropped in to tighten Castro-Com-

munist screws economically as well as politically.

position to Castro's brand of Communism among the old-line Parties in

this Continent. While Castro has Invested millions in subversion, Corvan

lan has patiently walted to caftalize on such investments and on fidel'g

own activities. Today more than ever, the old-line Communist Parties

throughout the Americas are in a hurry to displace Castro completely, and

surge a counter-coup right in Cuba, where Fidel has made a devastating

purge of the Old Guard.

October 25: "Castro's Meno to the Soviet Union".- A comment on the memo

presented by Custro to Gromyko concerning Cuba's needs with respect to

economy, oll, curroney, sugar, transportation equipment, industrial units,

etco, in order that Cuba's econcmy may get rolling again. Gromyko's crisp,

cold reply was that he would forward the demands to the soviet government..

"Mikoy»n-Gromyko". Soon 1t'11 be three yours since Mikoyan, in his

capacity as the Kremlin's Pro-Consul, travelled to Cuba to impose Soviet

decisions on the notorious "missile crisis". Three years later, another

Pro-Consul, Gromyko, shows up in Havana, also to impose Soviet decisions

on the puppet. The Kremlin is moking it plain for Fidel to understand

that he can't last a week longer unless he fully abides by Moscow's orderg.

October 25: "Not Even the Soviet Union Can Save Castro"= This article

comments the internal situ tion of Cuba and Castro-Communism at the time

of Gromyko's departure from the Island. Mention is made of growing dis-

content, of restlessness and dissatisfaction among Cubans, plus the

destruction of Cuba's light industry and agriculture. Other woes of the

Castroites are elaborated on, and, in the end, we call on those who form

part of the Castro government, but who nevertheless love Cubs, to help

put an end to the Red monster and to the anguish of the people.

could donounce Cuban maneuvers to help the Viet Cong.

During

the conferonce, Cobas was flanked by Antonio Arian, ¿ario Pérez and Humberto

tation was wrong®

Cobas added that all Cuban vencola have been ordered to take mil

1tary supplien to North Viet Nam from other Asian Communict ports, and that the Cu

an Embansy In Tokyo servos as coordinator for all such shipments.

Roforring to his former ship, Capt. Cobas explained that the Embaray had ordered

The Cuban diplomats withheld the ship's itinerary and declared that -

the "Aracello" would return to the Japanese port of. Yahata before proceeding to

North Viet Nam. By pretending that the ship would come back to Japan, they hoped -

to deceive the crew and reasure tho Japaneso as to the cargo and the use to which

the ship was being put.

The truth was, however, that, while in North Korea, the

"Aracollo" was to recoive orders to load a cargo of war supplies and sall directly

from thore to llorth Viet Nam.

According to Cobas, this could not be done in the end because the Tokyo Embassy was

warned at the last moment that the North Korean port of Chinnampo was blocked by

1co.

The "Aracello" was now ordered to pick up another military shipment at Shar

ghas and take It to North Viet lam. It was then that Cobas and his shipmates dec

Name

All Cuban ships have orders to carry cargo to North Vietnam to help the

North Vlotnamese war effort. The Cuban Enbassy in Japan Is asting as the coor

dinator for all ahipments of war maturial to North Vlotnam via Cuban shipe from

Communist porte in Asia. The Cutan Embassy In Tokyo had secretly arranged for

tho Aracolio Iglosias to take a shipmont of war mtorials from l'orth lorea to

North Vlotnam. In order to hide their intentions, the Embassy arranged that the

Aracello itinorary be kept up in the air until the last possible moment, then to

fool the crow and the Japaneso they gave the

story the ship would return to Japan

to lead tin cargo at Yahata and thon procood on route to North Vietnan, In real-

Ity, wo wero to roceive instructions on itinerary while in North Korea telling

un to procoed directly to North Viotnam aftor loading the war supplies.

At the last moment, howover, tha Embassy was informed that the port of

Chinnampo was blocked by ice. The Cuban Embassy then hastily arranged for us to

pick up a shipment of arms in Shangal previously soheduled for another Cuban

boat about the ond of January.

Logistical support to tho North Viotnamese is one of the two tasks assigned

to Mr. Nanuol Jorge Cuervo,: the now Cuban Ambassador to Japan. His other func

tion la to erase the bad effects on Japanese-Cuban trade caused by the defection

of the former trade Counselor to Japan, Gilbesto lemany. Tho Cuban government

le very concerned about the prospect of declining trade since already some comp

anies that formerly traded with Cuba, will no longer do so openly.

In genoral, I may say that wenberg of the Cuban merchant marine live under

unbearable conditions. The treatmant we roceive is so bad that no one foala

like cooperating with the marine purposes of the regime, even

In the few cases

where

there might be no treological incorratihility involved.

As examples of this treatment I may mention the constant spying on board

by members of the "G-2". For some reason, the "G-2" ran on board is usually the

radio and telegraph operator. In the "Aracello" we had one by the name of Eduar

do Sanches who was a notorious spy. Aboird we had another man called Yanuel Nía

Rodrigues who was imposed as the Fourth Ingineer, even though he had no training

or ability to perform auch duties.

fall. It is said that some of the diciesed naval officora were aisigned to the

merchant marine, and my men and I know a few instances. It is even true that

• Army officers with no naval experience are being appointed to high naval posi

tions. However, it is most likely that many of the purged officers will have

been shot or imprisoned. Such is. the Cube of today.

Lastly, we wish to emphasize that our decision to scek asylum in the United

States, has been made of our own free will. l'o have been pressured into this deod

sion by no one. Our consciences no longer permit us to serve the cause of a Com

mundat Cuba. Ilke hundreds of Cuhans before us, we who love Cuba deeply cannot

longer andure the tyranny with which she is afflicted.

We approciate with all our heart the help received from UNIDAD R'VLUCINARIA

and we also wish to thank the gentlemen of the Press assembled here, for the at

tention given us.

Francisco Cobas.

PSYCH 'ACTIONS WHEN CURRENT PSYCH EXPLOITATIONS COMPLETED MIGHT BE

MORE EFFECTIVELY ACCOMPLISHED UNDER AEGIS AMICE, ALL SURFACINGS SHOULD

CONVEY IMPRESSION WIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTION IN MERCHANT MARINE.

2. ODACID EXPRESSING SOME CONCERN OVER DEFECTORS' STATENENTS.

RE "ARMS" SILIPMENTS TO NORTH VIETNAM AND DESIRES ASSURANCE STATEMENTS

CAN BE SUPPORTED AT LEAST BY LOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS, IF NOT OUTRIGHT FACT.

OTHERWISE FEAR ENTIRE EFFORT, WHICH THEY FEEL IS NOST DESIRABLE, MAY

AR : FYI

REF: DIR-53981, 28 October 65

As Headquarters is aware, JMWAVE is refuting on a con

tinuing basis and via all appropriate assets commentaries

similar to that discussed in the reference. As for this

particular GOMEZ broadcast the Station prepared a guidance

for AMSCROLL use, primarily its radio, the point of

which

was that GOMEZ had become eligible for the

"Foot "n Mouth

Club" due his admission on 21 October that Camarioca was a

plebiscite and his statement on 22 October, no doubt as a

result of a prod from his Communist superiors that "I think

I made

excessive concessions

..." explaining that the people

are really leaving due to economic reasons.

We agree and

say that the economic reasons are to obtain three meals a

date been into monket a eyes on onto

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

We forward undor separate cover subjoct publication which was

recently sent to AMSCROLL mnil recipients interested in economic

materinl.

In produciny this study a particular effort was made to

keep it objective and factual on the theory that in the case of sugar

the facts spenk for themselvos and need only to be pulled toyethor.

We also believo that objoctive material similar to the attached should

over a perlad of time enhance the reputation of the AMSCROLL economie

scction as a serious and objoctivo outfit that secks to discredit the

Castro regime by publicizing the truth.

The Station would appreciate leadquarters' reaction to this

publication.

Additional copies

are available should distribution via

It may be of interest to report that a copy of the attached

1.- Cuba continues desperate attenots sell surar.- The Cuban sugar monopoly, CUBA

LUCAR, on September 6 concluded a sale of 5,000 tons of raw surar for October 1965

delivery to the trandan sugar organisation.

The origin of this sugar was hidden in

that it nas declared to have originated in the Caribbcan, including Peru, excluding

larket reports were correct in stating that the country of origin was in

The price agreed to was 18 pounds sterling per ton (C and F) Less 55-

shillings per ton to cover the expensos of the tender.

This doal was engineered by

Restzucker of Dortmund, an organisation also selling Cuban sugar to Jordan and which

wishes to keop its name out of those sales.

Another interesting development in Cuba's sugar selling activities during tho month

of Soptember was quoting sugar for futuro delivery at or under the London spot

price on the day the offer was bade. In other words, Cuba is offering sugar under

the world market value.

there was

relative calm during the period, and occasional manifestations

IMSCROLL pross roleases might complain bout continued froc-worl

the radio program would emphasize any

REFERZACE: UFGA 19181, dated 21 December 1964

A• OPERATIONAL

During December there was considerable pressure on AMSCROLL

to join political groupings being formed by ex-Presidents Urrutia

•and Price

Fortunately,

AMSCROLL was able to stay out of both without

incurring the wrath of either.

B. PRODUCTION

Although a number of new propaganda ideas were submitted by

AMSCROLL for approvalg the only new item for Cuban consumption

actually printed during the month was the pony bulletin.

10,000 items were distributed to Latin America and Spain, and 13,700

to

addressees in the U. S.

Most of the two latter categorios were

based on requests from religious, social, and civic organizationg.

Samples of the items and a breakdown of the actual numbers of each

distributed are in the attached ANSCROLL Propaganda Section report.

after a half century it still fails to improve the living standards of

the peoples engulfed, but instead incrcases terror and oppression to

Among letters ruceived during the month was a request from

The total is divided into

In process at montli's and wore a tro yenr annlysis of the

job still- to be done,

for Cuba showing how porsonal and family security are endangerod moro

by not doing anything than by

taking whatever steps against the regime

are possiblo depending upon the opportunities which artso; and a

lcaflot for Latin American distribution

showing on n map of Cuba the

reported sitos for the training of terrorists.

A new departure in

propaganda to Cuba will be tho printing of the

backs of all future

leaflets in script form so that thoy will appear to bo handwritten

lottors if viewed through the unvolopes.

Heretofore AMSCROLL has

beon ontolding othor printed material in a simulated handwritten

wrappor,

but now cach tom will havo its own "porsonal lotto" built

in to save valuablo weight and bulk in the covers while still hopefully

doceiving Cuban postal authoritios.
