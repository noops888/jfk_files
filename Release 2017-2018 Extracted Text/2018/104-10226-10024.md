1. Please pouch additional information about the
Proposed development of “the new AMFRAME orrunization” in
order to onable Hoadquarters to determine if there is any
conflict with the intent of the LNLOFT action approving

the termination of AHSCROLL.

2, As you may recall, it was originally thought that.
distribution of economic data might be handled by AHHIM,

after termination of ANSCROLL, possibly by creation of an
AMHIM economic desk staffod by former AMSCROLL employees,
In any event, neither AHcadquarters nor LNLOPT anticipated
that the termination of one orgunization would be followod
by development of another conducting the same operational
activities. On the contrary, our presentation to LNLOFT
emphasized further reductions of organizational support.

3. In addition to a dotailod description of the
Proposed organization and related administrative and operational
cost estimates, plouse forward more information abog@t plans

for distribution of the new series.

SUBJECT:

TYPIC/OPERATIONAL
AMSCROLL Progress Report
1 April - 30 Juno 1967

1 = CA/MARCHBANK
1 - CA Chrono
1 ~ RI Chrono

A. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

1. During the quarter under review AMSCROLL continued with
its program to discredit tho Cuban regime's cconomic management
(or mismanagement) and to seek to discourage Free World trade
with Cuba, To this end AMSCROLL continued publishing its serious
economic studies and comment of the Cuban economic areca, This
material is made available to selected firms engaged in inter-
national trade and shipping, to commercial and technical journals,
and to sugar. brokers including certain banks and others intcrosted
in the sugar trade. AMSCROLL also continued with its radio program
which is beamed to the Cuban audience and which is increasingly at~
tempting to provide serious comment upon economic developments in
Cuba or those areas of cconomic activity outside of Cuba which would
have an interost among the Cuban listeners, During this quarter
AMSCROLL ‘received 15 letters from Cuba which compares with 18 re~-
ceived during tho previous quarter, The monthly count was: April -

6, May ~ 5, June ~ 4,

2. On 30 April AMSCROLL ceased broadcasting over AMTHIGH.
Effective 1 May the program was presented over JMHOPE, This change
in station (and a consequent change in time) has perhaps effected
the listenership in Cuba; however, we expect that any unfavorable
developments will be overcome and that this program will at least
re-gain its previous level of listeners. Typical themes included
discussions of -Cuba's housing problem, its actual sugar production
measured against Castro's earlier claims of what the production
would be, breakdowns and stoppages at the Cuban refineries, activ-
ities with the Sovict Union and the world sugar market, reporting
the progress of the Venezuelan dock workers boycott of ships of
those nations that also trade with Cuba, the fight against bureau-
ecracy, and cconomic aspects of the Middle East crisis.

3. A main AMSCROLL cffort continued to be an analysis of the
current sugar crop, AS early as 13 February AMSCROLL predicted a
harvest within the range of 6,100,000 and 6,400,000. By 6 May
AMSCROLL was able to refine the harvest estimate from 6,047,000 to
6,101,000 tons. This estimate was further pinpointed to 6, 100,000
tons in a release dated 16 June, . These studies received newspaper -
attention and AMSCROLL has received favorable comment from sugar
brokers and other technicians engaged in this business. As events

are turning out, these estimates appear to have been sound in-
deed, The AMIUIM bulletin continues to give sont replay to those
studies which results in their dissemination throughout Latin

America,

4. AMSCROLL. continued with its monthly release which liste
the Free World ships that trade with Cuba, Both AP and AFP con=
tinued to file this’ information which results in its being pub-
lished in the press and used on radio nows broadcasts.

5.  AMSCROLL continued ite mailing program to Cuba, and
during this quarter mailings approximated 5,000 which is the samo

level as the previous quartor,

B. ADMINISTRATION

6, The amount budgetod for the quarter under reviow was
$33,500.00 of which $13,332.45 was spent, This significant do-
cline in expenses was in large part duc to the savings causod
by the cancellation of tho AMTHIGH radio program and by continuod
attention to economies of operation within AMSCROLL itself.

C, PROBLEMS

7. The Station is not aware of any specific problems having
to do with tho. AMSCROLL organization, Mention might be mado in
passing of tho over presont morale problom (which is by no moans
limited to AMSCROLL) engendered by increasing economies and re-

strictions in operations,

D, PLANS FOR THE NEXT QUARTER

8. A major effort is being made to revamp the ANSCROLL radio
program to increase its effectiveness as a reporter of economic
developments of interest to the Cuban listener. Too often these
programs spill over into tho field of political reporting or unin-
formed comment upon developments in economic areas of which the
script writers are largely ignorant, Our aim is to devise a pro-
gram of economic reporting that will conform to the new guidelines
being developed by the Station for all its radio programs,

FRONT PAGE:
1) EDITCRIAL! "The Arab Tesching":! Arat provertschow that Arabn are wise. They

were not torwise, howaver, when they tick the Soviets as allies and protectors,

Por years, the Huentens oupplied the arsenal the Arabs were building up to wage

holy war against the tiny Jewish enclave, Furthermore, they reiterated their un=

conditional eupport to the Arabs. But wten the “hour of truth" came, the Israel=

is made piecereal of the Arnbs and their Soviet Military hardware. The Russians

failed to come to the assistance of their silies, and both were ridiculed to the

fullest extent. ‘This should be a lessen for Pidel Gistro, who relies on the

Soviets! militery Junk ae much as on thelr support ae “allios".

2) CASTRO HIMELP PROPITIATES "BUREAUCKATISN™? After a brief recess caused by the
mobilization in the cane fields, the ‘wir of bureaucrati sm! was renewed with full
vigor by the Hevana régime, Two Ministers were fired, whole Ministries were "re~

tionalized", and payrolle were trimmed to the core. However, the same régime

that voiced threats of prison terms agains® those that failed to comply with
anti-bureaucrstie inetructions, creates new sources of bureaucratism, such as,

for example, tne Fook Inetitute and the lNiz.foral Institute for Forestry Develop~

men and Products.

1) SUNSHINE, AIR, AND WATER,.., BUT NO ECONOMIES SLLUTICNS? Tre MININDUS Vice-Ministry
for Technical Development has several fantertic projects in hand, such as the har
nessing of solar energy and of the force of the wind, the employment of energy

from tides in scuthern Pinar del Rio, and tte desalinazation of sea water. But,

on top of their intrinsically fantastie cherecter, these projects are paralyzed

due to the lack of technicians and cf techrize] handbooks, What great men Marx,

2) CARTOON? Headlines RYCOTT OF CUbAeTRAVING SHIPS TO BE STEPPED UP? Castro faces

a sinking vessel reamed "Maritisn Trade With Guba" and says? "It seems we have

sprung a leak?!"

160,000 tons of Brasilian sugar, It seems, we point out, that Morocco is determined
to quit Qui as a sxrar supplier, Firat che develops her ow sucar industry, then

UNA VERDAD COMUNISTA

Victor Voltky, Jefe de la Delegsciin Observodora
Soviétice of Xit periode de sesiones de fa Comsicn Eco-
eames de to O.W.U. paro America Lotinc, declaré recien-
tera ate an Caracas que “Cuba Comunista es Ia hije me-
not de Ia Union Sovietica, y 0 las hijos merores haste so
les mimo’.

Palabras son estos que tienon 1a virtud de onardecer
al més indiferento de los cubonos, yo que los mismas re-
fleian e) cite de superiorided con quo #stos orrogontos
comunistos eslavos tratan a nuesta Patra. Sin ombar-
#, 0 puede nogarse que cl insolonte Yelsky dijo une
verdod en Coracas, al menos en cuanta se refiere a fo
primare porte de sy oserto.

Ciertamente, los hijos menores dopenden de sus pax
dres. Son ellos quienes les proporcionan todo fo necesa~
4i9 pore su subsistencia; son ellos quienes determinan,
con Jo inapelabitided que supone lo patria potestad, ai
remke que hon de tomor fos pasos de su oderoble retoio;
7 ten ellos quienes s0 benelicion dol producto de sus
loberes.

Siends oi, no cabe duda de que Cubs es fa
wot de lo Unicn Sovistica, Lo URSS y sus sotél
efecto, venden a Cuba ef 78.6% d
fo URSS es quien detormina Ia politica que ha do seguir
el regimen ‘te Le Habana, y es lo URSS quien recibe, con-
juctamente con sus titeres de Europa Oriental, ef 80% de
Jes productos que exporta avestca Patria. Ante los dat
de este brutal monopolio comercial. y ante fo suprema ou-
torided que ejerce Ia metrspolt sobre su pseudo-colonia
de! Coribe, cquien puede negor que Cuba ss, 6 todos los
efectos practicos, lo hijo menor de ta Union Sovietica?

Haste aqui lo verdad. La mentiro estriba en ol aser-

tds queCuba es Ia hijo “mimada’’ de fo URSS. Porg

EDITORTAL: "A CONMUNIST TRUTH":
to the CEPAL moeting in Caracas, said that "Cuba is the minor daughter of the USSR,
The Russian's insolence has roused the anger of

Volsky, tho Chiof of tho, Soviet observing delegation

and minor daughtors are panpored",
all well.born Cubans, Yet, there's a lot of truth in what the Russian said,
Indood, minor daughtors depond on their parents, get ovorything they need from then,
and are subject to their supreme authority, If the daughter works, she must also turn
a good part of the fruits of her toll over to her parents,

This is what happons with Cuba and the USSR, The Soviets and their satellites sell
Cuba 78.6% of her imports, dictate the policy of the Havana régime, and take 80% of

her exporta,
In view of this dependence, who can deny that the relation between Cuba and Aissia is

that of a minor daughter with respect to her parents?
‘The Russian only lied when he spoke of "panpering". Cuba 49 not pampered by Mother

Russia: she 4s oppressed, exploited and corrupted by her,

1. On 27 March 1967, a letter from Cuba was received at
the postal address given by the radio program of AMSCROLL,
The letter had been mailed in Habana on 4 March 1967 and the
contents inclided. three photos of an unidentified individual
and one photo each of individuals identified as Reynaldo

“IRSULA Brea and Antonio ‘FERNANDEZ Fernandez. A note which
Was included stated that henceforth tne sendor would identify
himself as*'Parcrasio". He indicated that if it was desired
_ receipt of his letter could be mentioned on the AMSCROLL ietattersaactide
radio program but that never should any mention of the
contents be mentioned as this could reveal his identity to
the DSE. Pancrasio stated his help would not be much but
that his letters might contain information which could be

of value, He wrote that he could not go into detail as

he was unable to spend much time at the typewriter.
Pancrasio concluded by saying the photos of Antonio and
Reynaldo were in the hands of a security agent who had
orders to find them. They had both been fugitives for a
long time. The other photo (in triplicate) was of a
Canadian citizen whose passport was retained by the DSE and
was reported as lost for an unexplained motive.

2. On 10 April 1967, the message from Pancrasio was
ac nowledged by radio and he was thanked for his letter and
told to continue his correspondence.

mailed from Habana on 13 March and was directed to Guillermo
ALFONSO, 649 William Street, Key West. Typed on ole. 6:

two sheets of paper forwarded by Pancrasio was a note saying
this was lotter number fovr fren Panernsin and requesting
Guillermo ALFONSO to forward the papers to the same postal
address which he had previously utilized. Copies of the
contents of this letter are attach2d under separate cover.
The one paper, dated 27 September 1961, appears to be a

list of Costa Ricans who visited Cuba under the auspices of
ICAP. The second paper appears to be a list of Brazilians
who visited Cuba, probably in mid 1960 when Janio QUADROS made
Linbetee to Cuba as part of his presidential campaign in
razil,

4. On 2 May 1967, a JMWAVE Officer visited Guillermo
ALFONSO in an effort to identify Pancrasio and develop
sufficient information to evaluate his information and
determine the extent of his access. ALFONSO claimed he
had no idea as to the identity'of Pancrasio'and was unable
to suggest possible candidates from his reJatives in Cuba,
former work associates, classmates or neighbors. ALFONSO
had retained the envelop from Cuba which contained Pancrasio's
second message and a short message to ALFONSO, The note to
ALFONSO stated that PancraSio had received ALFONSO's name
and address from some unidentified individual and that it was
requested that ALFONSO forward the contents of the letter to
the AMSCROLL address which was enclosed, ALFONSO was
cautioned not to mention anything concerning the matter to
anyone, especially to relatives in Cuba. Pancrasio stated
this was his second letter (not fourth as indicated on the
material which was forwarded on by ALFONSO) and that the

- first had been sent direct to the AMSCROLL address. It was

stated this was the first letter by which ALFONSO would

. serve as intermediary and that other letters would come eee reeereeerti

at infrequent intervals. Pancrasio had decided to use an
intermediary address as the AMSCROLL address was too well
known. PRancrasio concluded his note by saying that he
preferred to remain anonymous and that he would be remaining
in'Cuba for two more years. In addition to the above cited
message, the letter to ALFONSO contained a calling card with
the name Dr_Luc B. I CENT, President of the Haitian
Revolutionary Movemen’ ‘On the back of the card was typed in
Spanish "without comment",

6. ALFONSO was instructed to forward any mail received
from Pancrasio in an expeditious manner and JMWAVE will
follow any leads obtained which might help to identify
Pancrasio in order to develop him into a more productive
source of information.

CUBA AND THE SOVIET UNICN: HOW MUCH. ENCY?

Cuba's dependency on the Soviet Union is known, The avestion iss how much de~
pendency? In order to arrive at some conclusion we have chosen Cuba's foreign trade

statistics for the 1959-1966 period.

We will work under the following economic assumption: Economic dependency of one

country on the other can be indicated to a considerable extent by their trade as this

indicates the need one country has of the other as a market for its exports and as

a supplier for its imports.

What we will do is to analyze the Cuban Trade Balance for the 1959-1966 period. *
1) According to the assumption we established regarding trade dependency, we can

say that during 1959 Cuba was dependent upon the Free Horld for its markets as total

trade value for that year amounted to $ 1,305,700,000 and trade value with the Free
World represented $ 1,289,000,000 (or 98.8% of the total trade).

Broken down into exports and imports we see that in 1959 Cuban exports totaled

$ 637,700,000 while total imports were $ 688,000,000. Thus, the trade balance showed

a $ 26,500,000 deficit, which was a reflection of the trend started in 1958 due te

* Every figure in this paper will be given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise
indicated, The sources for the ficures used throughout the analysis, the
‘table, and charts were: “The Economist", "The New York Times", UN's Econo-
mic Reports on Latin America, "Cuba Conercio Exterior" magazine, "Visign”
magazine, "US News & World Report", and The Economist Intelligence Unit's
“Quarterly Economic Review",
It should be remembered that the figures refer only to the Cuban Trade Ba

» lances i imports and exports, and not to the Cuban Balance of Payments

which would reflect loans and financial arrangements, plus the Soviet mili-
tary and teclrical assistance; figures which do not appear in the balance of
trade and which are not available to us with sufficient authenticity to ware

3) In 1961 the whole foreign trade picture was transformed. It was alnost the i

reverse of 1960. Total trade amounted to $ 1,253,600,000, of which Free World parti-

Cuba was now dependent, economically, upon the Communist World, especially the :

ners further cont fea Cuba's economy to the Communist Bloc.) a
4) In 1962, the trend continued, Total trade was $ 1,257,000,000, of which
$ 1,031,000,000 (82.1%) was with the Communist Bloc and only $ 226,000,000 (17.9%)

with Free World countries.

Another phenomenon appeared during 1962, The Soviets, who had been careful not

to press Cuba during 1960 with reoards to their trade balance (which was favorable to
‘Cuba by $ 31,000,000), were shrewd enough to close the gap during 1961, The balance
was favorable to Cuba by $ 11,200,000. 3

————,
: <Cieariy, the Soviet pressure was on, In 1962, Cuba faced a $ 227,000,000 deficit

with the Communist countries. Compounding this is the fact that by 1962 Cuba had spent

Dependency upon the Soviet Union arrived to stay as trade with the Coumunist World

time, surp as sed Cuban exports to the Bloc.

5) Two interesting developments occured in 1963, First of all, total trade with
the Communist countries maintained the 1962 level (s 1,031,000,000 in 1962 and
$ 1,054,900,000 in 1963), ,But, the Soviet Union tightened the grip by increasing its .
exports ‘to Cuba to $ 688,900,000 (in 1962 they represented $ 629,000,000), while Cuban

eae ee Cera OPT: COO ey ne

exports to the Communist Bloc decreased to $ 366,000,000 (in 1962 they represented
$ 402,000,000)," Thus, the imbalance for Cuba increased to $ 322,900,000 (in 1962 it
was $ 227,000, 000).

aacouf on

At the same time, Cuba attempted i approach to the Free World markets by taking

advantage of an increase in the price of sugar in the world market (sugar averaged

8.48 cts# per pound during this period). Cuba's total trade with the Free World in =

ereased to $ 354,300,000 (in 1962 St had been $ 226,000,000).

Nevertheless, the 1963,trade balance worsened-for-€vba-as-it showed a $ 323,200,000

6) For 1964, a favorable world sugar market (average price of 5.86 cts. per pound)
encouraged Cuba to continue its flirtation with the Free World, The Cuban treasury
was able to handle some hard currency for the first time in the Castro era and Cuban
conmereia] missions were sent to Europe and Japan to purchase items no longer availabb
in Guba,

Total trade increased to $ 1,722,000,000 and the Free World participation increased
from $ 354,300,000 (25.2%) in 1963 to $ 612,000,000 (35.6%). The Free World spending
spree took its toll as the trade balance with the Free World showed a $ 30,000,000 de-

ficit for Cuba, And here, we are speaking of a hard currency loss. :
Not even in the midst of Cuba's affair with the Free World did the Soviet Union
mere Se control of the situation, On January 20, 1964, Cuba was signing a trade agree=
ment with the Soviet Union by which it was commiting about half of its planned future
_ Sugar production to the Soviet Union for the next six years. The amcunts Cuba agreed
to deliver to the Soviet Unicn were : 2,100,000 metric tons in 19653 3,000,000 in 1966;
4,000,000 in 19675 4,000,000 in 19683 5,000,000 in 1969; and 5,000,009 in 1970, The
Soviet Union did agree to fix the price of Cuba's sugar at 6 cts. per pound, which
perhaps seems generous in 1967, but hardly a good offer on January 20, 1964, as the
price of sugar on January 19, 1964 was 9.50 cts. per pound. Adding insult to injury
the Soviet Unicn did not include in the 1964 trade agreement its previous commitment
to provide Cuba with 10% or 20K of the paynents in hard currency as it had done in the \

| 1960 agreement.

7) By 1965 Cuba was sai few trade missions abroad, -virtuatly- ceased-its-hard

~eurrency purchases, and-found -itself with alnost po hard currency (the average price
of sucar had dropped to 2,12 cts. per pound) pus During 1965 Cuba faced the Soviet Union
more empty handed than before and the general trade situation returned to 1963 level5

except that by now the Communist countries had more participation and the Free World



vy... -Trade with Communist countries also decreased (from $ 1,195,900,000 in 1965 to

had less. Total trade amounted to $ 1,551,000,000 (compared to $ 1,410,200,000 in
1963), but trade with Communist countries reached $ 1,195,000,000 (compared to
$ 1,054,900,000 in 1963), Trade with the Free orld remained at the same level
= $ 354,300,090 in 1963 and $ 356,009,900 in 1945, but sith a difference - the Cu«
ban deficit in its trade balance with the Free World rose from $ 300,000 in 1963 to
$ 60,000,000 in 1965. :

So, the Soviets continued in control as trade vith the Communist countries re=
presented more than three quarters of Cuba's total trade for that year. The sugar
production had already been mortoaged, the sugar market was depressed, and Cuba was
more and more dependent upen the Soviet Union.

8) Then cone 1966. Sugar prices decreased to an average of 1.86 cts. per pound,

Total trade decreased to $ 1,465,000,000 as compared with $ 1,851,000,000 in 1965,

$ 1,1€0,C00,000 in 1966) and the Sovietswere able to rush a little further and in =

(from $ 356,000,000 in 1965), but the Cuban deficit increased from $ 60,000,000 in
1965 to $ 65,000,000 in 1966.

Our conclusions follow:

LEIRST : Cuba is economicslly dependent upon the Soviet Union.

SECOND ; This dependency is increasing. It has risen from 1.2% in 1959 to 7
by 1966, a,

To buttress this conclusion we point out that:

A) Cuba has mortgaged “its sugar production to the Soviet Union.
B) Cuba has exhausted its-hard currency reserves. While an exact Figure 1s,

not available we estimated it to be about $ 20,000,000, in December 1964.

“ , ©) Cuba does not receive hard currency from its trade with the Conmuniat

countries under the present barter acreenents.



-66
D) Cubs has a $ 1,132,000,000 trade deficit with the Communist countries
for the 1963 = 1966 period,

Nor does this figure include Communist technical assis~
tance, military equioment, scholarships, and the like.

THIRD: Cuba has lost its position ag a meaningful trader in the Free World, which

in turn has increased its dependency upon the Soviet Union.

A. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

i

{

i 1. During the quarter under review AMSCROLL continued its

{ campaign to discredit the Cuban regime's economic management.

j As before, the campaign was conducted by the AHSC?0i! radio

i program and by serious economic studies and comment thet were

H provided its mailing list of sugar brokors, selected firms

‘ engage.. in international trade and shipping, and commercial and

i technical journals. The Station continues to be encouraged by

| evidence of increased acceptance of the AHSCfOL!. efforts. For

| example, AMSCROLL received eighteen letters from Cuba during this

H quarter, al] of which were in direct response to the radio progran.

+ S{--cieciee—- OF these, twelve were received in March which represents the

: highest monthly total since initiating the program, This compares

if with eleven the previous quarter and only three in the corresponding

quarter of 1963. In January, the Vice President of the Association

of Sugar Producers of Meade Riso called upon the ABSCRO:)

offices to request AHSCAOL!’s assistance in preparing a chapter

on Cuban sugar producticn pecbicae to be included in a book this

person is writing. AMSCROLL received requests from four universi-~

! ties or colleges requesting written mteriai, from a graduate

i Student preparing a thesis on the lot of the Cuban peasant, from

i

aevtinsisin Ramm t, uf So ei jpinpihtatblcew alesis Update

the U.8, Army Special Warfare School iibrary, and others. The
wire services, particularly Associated Press and Agence France
7 Presse, continued to file stories based upon AMSCROLL releases.

2. The ANSCROLL radio program continued as reported for the
last quarter--daily except Sunday for ten minutes over AMTHIGH..
: In addition, on 1 January AKSCROLL began a thirteen minute
: program each Sunday on AMIRIGH. These programs are in large part
confined to subjects of an economic nature with the time on
Sunday devoted to an in-depth analysis of what has occurred in
i this area since the previous Sunday. Typical themes hit through- .
4 out this quarter were: Economic and sociological aspects of wee
bie Castro's "San Andres' speech of 28 Jznuary, an unfavorable —-
7 -° balance of trade with Spain of $30,000,000, significance of Soviet
trade with Chile os compared with Cuba, an analysis of a UN i
economic study of Cuba which shows that rice production in Cuba
has declined 50% silitce 1860, the 2oyal British Institute's
finding that Cuba's economy makes her a poor trading risk, and
a report that Greek ship owners that persist in trading vith

Cuba are being brought to trial. Throughout this period and
whenever possible a particular effort was made to relate
developments in China to present or possible developments in
Cuba. The difficulties of the Chinese economy provided
examples to which a Cuban “twist could be put; e.g., the
Chinese and Cuban economic failures demonstrate the failure of
applied communism in the economic area.

3. AMSCROLL is continuing its analysis of the current
sugar crop. Its releases on this subject continue to generate
interest ard the Station has seen coverage in The Miami Herald,
El Universal (of Caracas), The Times of The Americas, and
Diario Las Americas. ‘The ANSCROLI. releases on Free World
shipping to Cuba were picked up by both AP and AFP and were
published in the newspapers listed in the previous sentence as
well as The Nontreal Star. The AMHIM Bulletin also carries
the bulk of these releases and we can therefore presume coverage
of at least some of this information in jatin America. An
interesting study was an analysis of British/Cuban trade which
demonstrates that Great Britain is now getting the better part
of the bargain; this story was filod by AFP as was a story of
the poor quality of molasses being soid by the Cubans to British
firms. Finally, AMSCNOLL continued to get mileage from the
Dawlier—Benz story by reporting that this German firm has finally
refused to sell spare parts to Cuba; the story was iat tad by AYP
and published at least by Diario [as Amoricas,

4. AMSCROLI. continued its mailing program to Cuba, but on a
further reduced scale. During the quarter about 5,000 were -
mailed versus 5,600 during the previous quarter. We count a
distribution during thie quarter of 7,127 press eee and
economic studies to places other than Cuba.

5. A recent development which may have an inte
operational potential was a telephone call to AMSCROi
Czarnikow-Rionda, the New York sugar brokers, which was
triggered by an AHSCROLL "case study" of the problems being
faced by a Cuban sugar mill. Tho firm told AMSCRO!. that 1% has
for some time suspected Cuban sugar production figures and f
wondered if AMSCROLL had any such suspicions. AMSCROLL (through | t {
AMPRAME~1) has written to say it would be most interested in ’
following any leads from Czarnikow-Rionda that could support a
conclusion that Cuban production figures are false, which is mie
where this matter now lies, The officials of Czarnikow-Rionda :
are well known to AMSCROLL and we shall be interested in seeing
what the firm developes for AMSCROLL.

AMMOP = Progress Re; 1 ~ PW/Chrono

+ : 1 October - 31 Doceuber 1966 1 BEG

A. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGETS

. 1. AMMO maintained contact with party leaders throughout
.-. the hemisphere during the quarter. The majority of the correse
ponéence was handled by AHCRIL/1, the leader of the youth wing,
who was informed by the JUDCA secretery-general, both during his
October visit and in subsequent correspondence, that the AMMOP
. youth wing was performing effective work and that a JUDCA study
Longmen OR ABMOP activities would be forthcoming. The JUDCA secretary~
general favors the incorporation of the AMMOF youth sector into
his organization.

x pout 2. AMMOP youth published two bulletins on their activities
along with an interesting summary on the sctivities of their
counterpsrts in other countries, which was mailed to a list of
contacts and correspondents. Several party officials in other

s countries have requested to be placed on the AMMOP mailing lists,

: ap indication that AMMOP is becoming more widely recognized as a

representative political povement.

3. The AMMOP youth group has also orgenized a series of
seminars which attracted from 30-35 participants during the quar=
ter. The purpose, in addition to offering discussions on such
subjects as politica, labor and agriculture, was to promote more
Group unity and to draw new sources of talent.

8, ADMINISTRATIVE

4.. During the quarter, expenses totaled $2,075.77. This sum
included monthly support to AMMOP, and salary and oferational
expenses of AMCRIS/1, This compares with a budget allocation of
;. $3,750 for the reporting period.

C. PROBLEMS

8. The difficulties in the operation of the AMMOP project
are due largely to the lerk of effective leadership and initiative,
The AHHOP youth wing is operating with reasonable effectiveness
within its sphere but is kampered by the lack of active JUDCA
membership.

D. FUTURE PLANS

6. Additional seminars are projected for the next quarter.
Both AMMOP acd its youth sector will aaintaia active correspondence

‘to gain recognition as knowledgeable and active groups. In addition,

future AMMOP activities will be aimed at creeting a more cohesi
organizational structure, attracting responsible leadership talent
to the or; ization, and gaining greater recognition and possible

financial support and guiducce from the Parent International Move-
meat.

A, OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

1. The AMKNOT organization continued during the quarter
under review with its program of assisting Cuban merchant
2 mariners who have defected from their service, “Fifteen diff-
erent cases were handled during this period which included
five resettlement cases in areas other than JMWAVE, Billets
at sea were found for two more--one as a first mate and one as
a third mate, The remaining eight received assistance in obtain-
ove tenner dng employment or what might be called administrative aid-assis—
tance in obtaining social security numbers, etc.

- 2. Processing continued for those interested in employment
+ -. by the Milt. Sea Transport Service (MSTS). Progress in -~
obtaining the necessary U.8. Coast Guard certification is slow
and of the four that applied for this during the previous quarter
t only two had received the certificationh: the end of the current
ia quarter. During this quarter two more former Cubans merchant
officers sought through AMKNOT this certification as they expressed
= interest in MSTS employment. The current status is: In process--6;
Coast Guard certifications received--2; physical examinations given
‘ * (and passed)--4, In addition, applications for employment together
with the Coast Guard certifications and completed physical examin-
ation forms were forwarded 28 December to the cover company in
Baltimore for 2, The remainder will be forwarded as the Coast
Guard certifications are received.

3. The activities of the AMKNOT organization continue to
receive publicity. The Station has four clips from different
a+, papers including one from 51 Universal of Caracas. AMKNOT issued
one press release during this quarter which was an "eyewitness"
account of the attempt of four Cuban sailors to obtain political
asylum in the Canary Islands. In fact, this was a letter mailed
to AMKNOT by «USPOT-2 and signed in pseudonym. The story was
oat picked up by Diario Las Americas in its 15 December issue.

4. The AMKNOT organization remains constituted as reported
in the previous Cuarterly Report. However, in December AMASK-1
was offered a permanent position ag personnel director of a local
shoe company that employs some four hundred people. His starting
salary will be $475.00 per month which will be iacreased rfter
the first three months and increased again after the second three
months, The Station concurred with AMASE=] that he accept. for
these reasons: (1) The AMKNOT position is uot permanent, (2)
it appears that AMASK-1 will be terminated when AMKNOT 1a closed,
(8) this position should solve AMASK~-1's personal financial prob-
lens, and (4) AMASK-1 has agreed to remain as chairman of AMKNOT
without salary and to continue to lend his name to the organization.
The Station expects to replace AMASK-1 with AMPOLISH-1 who appears
qualified to handle the hand-holding and housekeeping aspects of
AHKNOT. AMPOLISH-1 is presently employed by a local automobile
jary time off to handle the

ry) The Station will be spared a possible disposal situation when
ABKNOT is closed (it has been made clear to AMPOLISH-1 that this
is a temporary assignment that at the most will last for a few
months), (2) We have offered AMPOLISH-1 $200.00 per month versus
$380.00 for AMASK-1, and (3) AHASK-} should be in an excellent
position to offer at least temporary employment in the shce fac~
tory to mariners to come.

5. An estimated total of $2,505.00 was spent during this oo
quarter. This amount represents AMASK-1's salary and allowances,
office expenses, and English instruction for those seeking MSTS
employment. Expenses by month were: October, $855.00; November,
$825.00; and December (estimated), $825.00. The allotment for
this activity for the quarter was $3,000.00.

C. PROBLEMS

6. The chief problem of the period was caused by the antics
of who jumped ship in New Orleans after a run-
in with the ship's captain and after difficulties with the Immi-
gration and Naturalization Service over the lack of proper documen-
tation vo re-enter the country. has been resettled in
California, though we may not have heard the last from him; AMASK~1
recently received letter from hich said that
about to sue the shipping Jine © d employed him for back
alary and loss of personal effects that ‘claims the captain
had locked up. AMASK-] was advised to ignore the letter in view
of the difficulties already caused and in view of his potential for
further trouble (see paragraphs 2 and 3 of JMWAVE-3990).

D. PLANS FOR THE NEXT QUARTER

7. ‘The Station currently plans that AMPOLISH-1 will assume
his duties with AMKNOT on 2 January 1967 as this is the date
AMASK=] will join the shoe company. AMKNOT will continue pro-
cessing applications of those interested in MSTS employment and
will encourage additional applications from those that appear
qualified and interested. Also, AMKNOT, of course, will receive
all ¢efecting mariners that appear in the area and will continue
to encourage, where it can, additional defections.

2. Correspondence with Internatione) Organizations - Correspoo~
deneo was maintained exchanged with the International Commission
of Juriats, the Americas Fund for Free Jurists, and the UM and OAS
International Commizsiona of Human Rights. The subject matter of
this correspondence was identical with the subjects mentionec ia

paragraph ic above.

3. Impact - In an effort to focus attention on the Cuban
political prisoners issue, AMBASAL/1 prepared 2 15 page document on
this subject which he presanted in person in October 1866 to the
Human Rights Commission of the OAS. The president of the commission
told AWBASAL/1 that thie document was the best he had seen on the
Subject and the cummissioa, after discussion, agreed to continue
eiforte to get permission to travel] to Cuba to investigate the
- eharges contained in the document, AMBASAL/1 also visited the UN ‘ ae
5 Human Rights Commission, the Interanerican Federation of Lavyers, 4

the American Fund for Free Jurists, and the president of the Inter
2 national Red Cross. All ip all, the effort to focus attention on
= the political prisoners issue was successful and resulted in wire
at gervice, radio, and press coversge. A total of 23 clippings,
z Gealing with AMBASAL/1's activities im ‘this regard, was sent to
Eeadquarters.

4. Radio - The weekly AMBASAL radio programs were carried
by JMHOPE and tapes of each program were sent to SWDULL/1 for
re-broadcast. The content of these programs was in line with
the juridical nature of the AMBASAL organization, although
editorial comment was frequently made on current themes not
specifically related to the legal field.

B. ADMINISTRATION

5. The 1967 fiscal year budget for AMBASAL is $43,000.00.

_ On a quarterly basis the allotted figure is $10,750.00. During
- this quarter AMBASAL expenses amounted to $11,760.72, a total

.of $1,010.72 in excess of the allotted figure. Of the overall

“quarterly expenses of $11,760.72, agent salaries accounted for

$7,000.00, radio expenses amounted to $1,901.72 and $2,859.00

was spent on printed propaganda, operational travel, and miscel-

laneous office expenses, Total operational expenses for the

first eix months of FY 1867 were $23,987.28, an excess of $2,487.28

over the $21,500.00 allocated for the first half of the fiscal “oe

6. Termination of the principal agent may be difficult.
-Consideration is being given to the possible future use of
AMBASAL/1 25 a singleton agent. The alternative is to assist him
in finding suitable employment; a difficult task given his age
(42), complete lack of English, and aspects of his personality
and character.

7. We do not anticipate any other probleus relative to
the termination of this operation. The AMBASAL newsletters sent
to Cuba were stopped with the October issue and the monthly
bulletin with the November issue. Four of the AMBASAL personnel
were terminated 31 December and the radio programs were baa canta
an December.

+ DD. PLANS POR THE NEXT QUARTER

8. Three AMBASAL employees will be terminated effective
$1 January 1967 and the AMBASAL office will be closed during that
month. It ie planned to permit AMBASAL/1 to retain sche of the
equipment now in his office to encourage him in his Plans to con~
tinue to operate on a scaled-down, independent basis., will

B, ADMINISTRATIVE

“B. During ‘the second quarter of FY 67 the AMLIRA organization
expended $17,300 and had income of some $600 from news stand sales
and advertising. Both these figures are approximate projections
because the final December figures are not recorded at this
writing. The net figure for expenditures during the quarter (sone
$16,700) exceeds the budgeted amount by approximately $400. However,
this overage will be absorbed in further budgetary cutbacks during
the next reporting period.

6. Tho AMLIRA activity expenditures also exceeded the budget
allowance curing the last quarter. To remedy this situation the
following specific economy measures will go into effect beginning
1 January 1967:

a. One saleried employee will be dropped.
Monthly saving....$250

offprints from the AMLIRA magazine will be

b. Publication of monthly pamphlets with selected 1.

from the interview was a sympathetic recounting of the ‘AESTRUT=2

4. The AMSTRUT-2 weekly radio spot on AMTHIGH continued with-
cut schedule change during the quarter, Significant themes included:
comments on the degraded role of women in the Communist state compared
with that in the free world; reference to the nyth of Communist unity
ag revealed by the split between the ChiGoms and the USSR; mention of
the possibility that Cubans will be sent to North Viet Nam tO fight
end die; comment on the treatment of prisoners in Cuba and the UHAP

and editorisl comment on the visit of Haul CASTRO and President

B, ADMINISTRATION

i
i
i
H 5. During the second quarter of FY-67 there were expendi- ;
tures of approximately $19,000 by the AMSTRUT-2 activity. Thie i
figure includes an estimate for the month of December becaure i
H the final figures Lave not been received at this writing. The i
budgeted amount for AMSTRUT-2 for the quarter is $24,600 and there
is an excess of budget authorization over expenditures of approxi-

mately $5000, This figure, however, gives an unreel budgetary

: Picture of the AMSTRUT=2 activity. This $5000 will remain as a

i part of the budget allotment and may well be expended in a flurry
of AMSTRUT-2 travel, publication activity and/or promotion during

tha next quarter, In other words the excess docs not represent

budget. "fat" since the bulk of tne AHSTRUT-2 expenses are not

figured as month to month constants but obligated asthe operational
eituation demands,

6. During December AMSTRUT-2 moved into a smaller house with
@ lower rent which wiii mean a saving of $100 per month, In ;

addition, it is anticipated that a further saving will be realised
in maintenance and upkeep costs.

a C. PROBLEMS : ‘

i 7. ‘The basic agent-handling problem presented by AMSTRUT-2's t
1 mércuria! disposition, excessive generosity and understandable '
i emotional approach to the role which mst be played before the pub- }
i lic still exists, However, it seems to have lessened somewhat as i
i AMSTRUT-2 gains confidence in the language and in dealings with the ‘
Public, There is little question that a contributing factor to the Pp

lessening of this problem is the reliance placed by AMSTRUT-2 on A
AMLYRIC-1 who serves ss business advisor, buffer and hand-holder, \
i

8, The problem of projecting the image of the AMSTRUT~2 Founda- g
tion as an independent charitable organization remains, The appli- i
} cation for tax exempt status to the state of registry is in the works
1 and when this application is approved it is likely that there will be i

an increase of private donations which, because of the new status, will [|
be tax deductible, The problem lies in the dilatory behavior of the j

eppear to parallel those of AMSTHUT=2 and the Cuban exile community
as a whole, AMSTRUT-2 has not always been able to sort out the "good

partisan political ends,

D, PLANS FOR NEXT QUARTER

organizations at Harvard University which wish to sponsor an
AMSTRUT~2 appearance there, The tentative plan at thie writing
is for AMSTRUT=2 to appear during the first part of

11. The ghost-written AMSTRUT-2 book on AMTHUG-1 should be
ready for first reading at least sometime during the next quarter,

12, It 4s planned to have AMSTRUT-2 prepare a rebuttal
(probably, to be ghost-written by AMLYRIC-1) to the interview with
Fidel CASTRO which appeared in the January issue of Playboy maga-
vine,

13, Further speaking engagements and tours by AMSTRUT-2 are
being planned for the next reporting period. It is also planned
that, with the official approval of the tax-exempt status of the
Foundation, an extensive fund rusing campaign will be launched to
provice working capital and funding cover for operational activi-
ties as well as humanitarian and social welfare programs in conso=
mance with the AHSTEUT-2 Foundation charter,

Last year we gave you informetion and full details 37 vessels under
GREEK and LESANON flags which continied, and still CONTINUS trading
with Cuba, the biggest and most influential of them being FRAIGISTAS,
trading under both flags. We tol@ you lest year thet we did not think fare
Frangistas would stop trading. He has not. Galy recently when a group it
of loyal and lawful Greek Owners took the matter to Greex Parliament, ae
the U.S.A, Authorities appeared tc wake up and demanded tat the ttinister ie

of Foreign affairs should ask the Minister of !ercantile Marine. to i
produce a list of Owners still trading with Cuba. How come that a Greek :
Miristee of Mercantile Marina should have a list, a very long List, of :
Greek ships still trading with Cuba, and yet he had done notaing about u
to stop the illegal trading, in contravention of his laws. Few months Bet
ago, few smcll Owners, the small fish of course, were asked to show where :
thelr ships had been trains, knowing of course they had been trading with |
Cuba. The local Courts were still " making enquiries". Nothing was done |

natuarally about Frangistas, whoek is responsible for about 90% of the
whole movements. How can he be prosecuted , by his partners , since it
is more than obvious and clear that wnatever ho docs nas the blessing of \
the authorities, both in Greece and in Lebanon. Frangistas has been

openly boasting, and he has proved his point, that the laws of Greece and }
Lebanon, cnlyepply to-ordinary individuals, not to A1ii. We do not Know :
what the Minister's list is, but we shall not be: surprised if that list t
contains only a fraction of his movements, and he will ro doubt say that

H

H

his contract was signed before the ls Cf course ha will. Any contact i

can be faked and back-dated, with the connivange of the Charterers. 4

The only contrect Frangites had was with the Ruscians and the Russians i

never make contrects for more than one year. He bas signed severi if
.eontracts with the kussians since 1963. But let us forget about the

Russians for a moment. Did he also have lialY years contracts «with t

the Germans, the Chinese, ths Syrians, the French, the Dutch, all :

would not be entzh to cover these, had there been contracts. No, all
his cargoes to Cuba and from Cuba (ith possibly few cargoes with the
Russians carried latest few months after the law) were contracted after
the law, an& vere fixed in the open markets a cargo or tw? or three at a
time, either direct withthe countries concerned or via London, and his
ships have appeared in Freighs lists on the day they were fixei, in
competition with other Owners and flags. If you or the USn Authorities
. were to apooint a reputable Chartering Sroker in London, he would tell
you exactly upon which date, what quantity, what destination. waat rate
of. freight, each cargo was contracted. why do not you ask the Greek and
Lebanon as"horithes to demand that h: prhduces a list of nis 36 vessels
with all their logbooks, the charter parties, the timesheets, the vfreignt
statements, and bandng recéipts and let all these be examined by the
London 3roxer , not the Greek or Lebanon Authorities who cover his ca
dilegal trading. And what about the Cubeas. Did Frangistas also have
very long contracts with the Cubans, signed before the law in 1963, ard
are still valid and unexpired? Is tais why Frangistas was in Havana at
vat end of last year, and again beginning of this year, when ne fixed six
liberties on timecharter for 9) I2 KiXKK months, comiencing early in
1966, ani did he also fix the EFTHYCHIA for three years tinecharter with
the Cubans, @:ring nig vieit in Havana as stated above, before tne law

with private Charterers, not the Russians or Cubans, for the fixing of
his older tonnage , ths Liberties? This takes place at a tima that

Greek and possibly Lebanon Authorities are supposed to be prosecuting him :

for his past sins. This is how much notice ne takes of the Authorities.
Dozens of Masters, Officers etc., intluding Frangistas are suposed to
be in prison, to have paié huge fines, ani to have lost their flags,

in uecordance withe the povisions of the law. To our knowledge no one
has been imprisoned, no one has paid fines, no flag hes been withdrew,
end any time you nt Frangistas do not look f-r nim in his office. Ha
will not be.there. He has no time for offic2, he is too busy with the
Authoriti2s in Athens or Lebanon. ‘/ell , no one could ever imagine

that the USA Authorities would cont‘nue to bataxen for 4 ride , and to
continue giving their aid to countries which use it against then. May

be this, {s the American Policy, who knows. The Usa did in fect say
recently that unless Cuban trading is stopped, they would stop their aia.
Fitstly , 19 this enough, doez it mean they do not mind for trading so
far, so long as further trading is stoppe, hich will clear up and
justify all Frangistas past sins? And secondly, we are certain , Frangi-
stas, will find the way, te continue trading. ino is to stop him. The
aémeticans obviously cannot , the aie and Lebenese will not, therefore
the Show goe3 on. which means CHILic DOES PAY, and stupid those + think

CUBAN TRADING

We expected by now some action from your end or from the American
Authorities to whom we had sent our previous copied comuunication to
you(Washington,Foreign Ministry, and U.S.A, Embassy,London), but regret
that, at least to our knowledgs, no action has been taken yet, and we
assume this by virtue of the fact that the ships we mentioned previously
just carry on the voyages for which have been fixed, and their Owners
openly negotiate further similar business from Tuba , as most of the
trade to Cuba is presently done by Red flag ships. However, we supplement
-our previous letter by gtving you some additional information.

Ae Bane Kerobants in Cuban Trading, but mainly D.‘Enree, of Paris and Gene
- fix vessels or large eggtracte » with a long list of options as to i
where the cargo will/discharged, as often cargoes are shipped end not.
golé until after shipment and sailing of the vessel from loading port.
‘ These options start from Casablanca/Continent and continue into all
Mediterranean/2ed Sea/P.Gulf/Iniia/Colombo/Malaya ports,sonetimes as
far as Japan, freight rate depending at *hich port cargo is discharged,
@ fihal orders are usually given seven cays after sailing from Cubase
‘As stated, the Lebanon Authorities oestensibly allow Lebanon flag ships
‘to carry these cargoes to Arab Countries only, always subject to
- -Yieense. Owners spply for such license for Arab countries, and then
‘4f the. Merchant ordors the ship to say Italy or Germany or Japan, the
ehip just oarries the oargo. Some Owners just do not apply for a license
at all, and the Lebanon Authorities know what goes on, but turns tae
othor way. cae

WB Greek and Lebanon flag ships just carry on trade in Cuba, and if you
-gay they @o not, then either you do not know about it, or they must
sanouflage their flags , or must fake ( as regards eventual destination)
thoir documents , suoh as charter perties , Bills of Leading, manifests
etoe, Bren the number of ships trading in Cuba , given in your

- oireulars , is not correct , it is much larger, may be you do this
intentionsliy for political ressons or maybe because you do not know.

6. Both the Grosk and Lebanon Govormaents are in a position, in accordance
with their famous laws, to stop immediately any ship , to taxe the
flag away , and to imposo upon the Owners very neavy fines end if the
*Gmors.do not pay the fines, then the ship will be imaobilised since
the Govermzont will rofuse cancellation of registry certificate, meanang
that the ship cannot be put in a nothor flag, and thefefore, bescue
virtually not-oristent, They caa do lots of thigs, these Coverments,
but only if they want to and only if they want to apply their laws.
fo our knowdedge, and we oan assure you, ve arevery'«511 informed, no ‘2 :

beca fined, and mayodo , and mostly likely, will never be. !

trading with Cuba, otherwise you will find that one affer another many

In response to your letter of November 19th, concerning
Greek and Lebanese shipping to Red Cuba ports, I am enclosing
some information I have obtained which should fulfill your
requirements. In the case of the Lebanese Directives, you
will note that no specific reference is made to shipping to
Cubs. i
Despite the fact that the enclosed information ts not
classified or restricted, it was obtained from a sensitive
source and I would appreciate it if you would handle this
matter discreetly.

We have been very pleased with the information your
organization has been providing us concerning shipments to

I hope that the data provided will be helpful to you. .

Very sincerely yours,

Wie wrote you few d2ys ago about the iilegal ouban trading and we now —
enclose hyre~ith cutting fron to¢ays , 5th Hoven ber 1966, Pirseus Newspaper
"KarfILla sX2kuSS " from which you will observe that action is now being
taken ( three years too late and after millions of ‘ons of cargo has been
carried to and frou Cuba) against Cuners, Captains etc., of sreek ships.
The Greek Xinistry of Hercantile Marine are also instructing Dort Autho~
rities to enquire and investigate woica ships traded witn Cuba since 1963.
You see , until now , or even now, the Ministry did not know... and now
they will try to find out. No doubt owing to some half hearted pressure by
the Usa authorities , the Greek Authorities are at last compelled to at

ve least show that they are trying to finf out , now , wnich ships traded, -

also n> doubt they will fine some ships which traded and will prosecute

the Captains and the Owners, and perhaps carry out some sort of punishment.

and naturaily it will be th2 small und unimportant Owners they will trace.

The biz and influential will not even de tfaced. If ore nos to be traced,

like Frengistas, they will find 211 necesssry excuses and reasons for

not prosscuting. the job for enquiring , prosecuting, and punishing the

: offenders is left with tnose with whose connivance and knowledge trading

continued since 1953, and still continues, so anyone can imugine, what

kind of a Jod they whl) di ve wonder why no enquiries ware made during

1963, 1964 , I9€5. Sirply d2cause enquiries were not necesszry. You do

not enquire absut something you already know, The latest excuse o° Pren-

-gistas, as we think you already know, cores throiga his brother, woo is

a Professor in Salonica University, that the lew prohibiting Zabsa tradiag

was Unconstitutional]. This joxe was as good as any, even better than the

one 2bout his false or fake contracts and charter partics. His other brother

who is the real tafluence with the Russians and is a timber uerca having

the monopoly 2f#all Russian timber inports into Gree and soue fruits

from Greede to hussia,'is the one who helved to secure sae builcing in

Russia of some 35 large liners and tulk carriers plus a huge fish trawling

fleet, in exchange for Greek products, and sort payment if cash rem the

vast profits thay made out of their 35° seconi nuné liberty vessels in

Cuban trading. zven in this respect, do not forget that this srivilege

of building these fleets( and we um mierstand furt! ‘ner building contracts

are cooking) was only given to the rrangistas clique by the Greek and

Russian Authorities ,end not to any sther Greek Owner. Do the USA Authori-

ties really think that the Greek Authorities ( and in a saaller degree

the Lebanon Authorities) +211 prosecute Frangistas, and even if they do,

for eyewesh , they will find him guilty? You will see that nothing will

happen, ‘Yhat we now have to say, as the only solution, may seen be pres peta

but it is the only way to stop this rot. This is that the Usa should dis-

continue iomedtately , and ythout any notice, all Military and fineanctal

Aid to Greece and Lebanon, with intimation to tien » that they will
consider renewing sane, as soon as firstly ALL trading with Cuba is stopped
immediately disregarding any so called old contracts, and secondly AFTDR

ae they have prosecuted and punished vxeroperly all lawbreakers, szall-and
big ones alike, and after all flags have been cancelled. This second action
is a big ‘debt the USA Authorities owe to all the Greek“and Lebenon Owners
who complied withe laws of their ccuntries and executed the wishes sof the
USA. It “is a moral debt. These people will gain nothing bec-use they
do not ask fpr any money for 311 fortunes they lust in not trading with
Cuba, but the Yoa,as a country krown as just and democratic, will hav 7
failed in their duty if they are comznt to just see discoatiniation of ae
further trading with Cuba , and no punishment for the past sinners. ant ae
talking of sins , we think that the Greek and Lebanon Authorities conaitted
end still conait a bigger sin than the Owners, since tae Owners are sinsly

Simply because they already know all lewbrzakers, andathey have all the

CUBAN TRADING

Your circulars regarding Cuban affairs and trading contain useful
information but it seems that neither you nor the American Authorities
are well informed. You know that, through Anerican pressure, the Greek
Government banned,several years ago, all trading with Cuba for Greek flag
vessels, except few which were on timecharter and were allowed to ran %
their charters, w.ich finished a very long tine ago. Similarly, the Lebano
Gbvernment banned all trading with Cuba for Lebanon vessels, fey months
ago, and only allow, subject special licence, their ships to carry goods
from and and to countries of the Arab League. Both countries passed laws .
to this effect, and both state that infringement 68 the law carries very
heavy fines against the O:mers and Masters, and withdraval of the flage
That is what the laws say, but what is actually happening is another
matter, Greek and Lebanon flag vessels have continued, since banning,
to be fixed, have carried and are carrying cargoes, through 4 nunber of
Owners, such as Yrankistas{ Franco Shipping Co. of Lisbon and Athens,

: per Purvis shipping Co, London, their U.K. Agents), bwkkk owning about

35 Greek and Lebanon flag Liberties and similar vessels, also Viassopoulo,
Livanos, etc., also owning a great nunnber of ships with these flags.

They simply say they do not care a dagn about the ban, and continue to
making fortunes in the Cuban trading, the reason being that as most sali

remains wide open for these people. They do not even try to hide, they
just fix their ships, tiostly in the Baltic Sxchange, London, and Athens,
but also direct with Charterers in Poland, iiungary, Boulrgaria, . oe
Russia, etc. and with Paris, and Geneve. The Governments of Greece and
Lebanon, who made the laws, just look on, doing nothing about it, and
this means that the lews were made, for paper value only. Some of these
Owners fix their ships by name and flag, others just fix a contract

to be carried by ships, to be nominated later, and later they nominate
greek and Lebanon ships. Only the last few days, the following were fixed
on the Loncon market: . Frankistas, 50.000 tons sugar from Cuba to England
for sugar Merchants Tate and Lyle, London, to be carriad in 2 or 3 months,
and Frankistas has already nominated the NICOLAOS F.(Greek flag) and

San Spyridon (Lebanon flag), fpr 20.000 tons and the remaining 30.000
tons are being nominated also for Creek and Lebanon flag ships.The sane
Qwmer just also fixed one cargo for “almo(Sweden), and one to Gdybia,
Poland, He is presently negotiating several other cargoes, fr his

large Greek and lebanon flag ships, whh the aforementioned concerns,
including another contract with Dt Enreo of Paris, via Geneve.

The AIS GIANNIS (Lebanon) was fixed with Dreyfus, Landon , few days

ego, to carry a cargo of beans from Vera Craz and Tampico to Cuba, and
after for sugar to Europe . Another concern trading with Cuba is
Tsavliris of London and Athens ,but this firm is not trading with Greek
Lebanon flag ships. :

The World thinks that you and Amprican Athorities know all that goes on
in Cuba. If so, it means that neither you nor Auerican Authorities know
and do not mind such trading with Greek and Lebano ships if they know.

We have given you some details of th»: latest fixtures. You and American
Authorities can check up without any thouble and when they verify the
correctness, they will no Bonbdt protest imuediately to the respective
Governments, ask them to stop immediately the carriage of these cargoes
and punish their Owners etc., as per their laws, and denand log books,

they brs or you, do not ao anything wout it, it will mean that both
you and American Government knew and know about this illegal trading and
do not mind, in which case, we can more then essure you, that witnin the

next fow weeks, the so far law abiding Ormers of Greek ond Lebanon flag
vessels, will also re-commence or start trading to Cuba, for the simple
Teason that they will feel that they are breaking no laws, eince they
who asked the Governments of Greece and Lebanon to pass the laws, do :
not mind if they ere not complied with. It remains,however , a great ‘
mysteery, beczuse ve cannot baieve that the Anerican Authorities do not
know about this trading and why they have not protested to the Lebanon
and Grevk Governments,and if they do not know, then there is sonething
very drastically wrong with their Intellig-nce.

Anonymous letters are not good things, in fact quite deplorable, but
we trust you will understand the reason for anonymity in this case, and

since vou will no dovbt like to know who wrote it, wecan tell you is H
written on behalf of

that their compliance
if it is proved that

some people who are very bitter and disappointed i

with the law puts them in disadvantage, especially
to comply with the law does not pay. .ie have

given you sufficient information to chec§ facts imreiiately and etop t
all the wrong, doers. If they are not stopped, then your circulars will F

have to incrase,in the very near future, tne number of Greck ard Lebano
ships trading with Guba. .

From the ecdnonic point of view Crstro's csrmmint régim is well on the

* plus the low world price, it ie unible to eupport the Cuban economy. .The second

This economic.chaos has forced the Cuban régime to increasingly desperate
measures in order merely to eurvive, For example, meet, tobacco, eggs, fruit, _ :

TORACCO i

Iwas associated with the tobacco oxporting onterprise (Empresa CUBATABY~
CO) for four years ieluéing three yoars as Assistant “anager. I am happy to
make ny first hand knovledge ‘available,

’ ‘Tid tpdustry 4s canothor example of the administrative clumsiness of the
Gomtunists, Once the second industry of Cuba, and the source of great prestige
for our country, 1t seems to be dooned to total destruction since the Commnist
régime took control of it.

Leaf tobacco production has declined by ovor 30% conparing the 1965 ‘figure
(32,000 M.T.) with the traditional production of over 45,000 M.T. yearly, The
best tabacco fields of tho famed Vuelta jbajo zone, which gave the best wrapper
in the world, have expertenced a sharp decline of over 70 in yield ami quality,
due to lack of fertilizers and the necoscary care. .

About 20% of the plantations are affocted by tho bug, as the fields and
curing sheds are not ‘sprayed. The INR policy. of vory low prices paid and lack
of ineentives given to the most efficient producers has forced the producers to
divert their lands to less risky and more profitable crops, This is particular-
ly true. of the Remedios and Cabaiguén zones, Peasants trained in tobacco grow=
ing have been absorbed by cane growing areas in order to remedy the critical
manpover eftuation in the latter, but at the expense of inflicting grave damage
to the tobacto economy,. This has brought the incorporation of “volunteer” works
ers to the cropping of the leaf, which workers, due to their inexperience in _

- Buch a hemes work, break the leaf, with the resulting damage to its qual=

ity.

Industrial Aspect. - - : : . 2 2

Tho industrial phase of the tobacco, industry has not been better off, and -
in our opinion it has been the one that has suffered most from the inconpetency -
of the régime, The quality, prosentation, and production volume of Cuban cigars
has been seriously affected, not only as fer as production for national consump-
tiori is concerned, ‘but also as regards the portion designed for export, It vould
be endless to'list the wronge that have been done, but they may be outlined thus

1) Loss of quality due to the use of raw leaf tobacco and without ed ne
essary aging. i

2) Failure to deliver to foreign customers due to thé lack of intersediate
materials to finish the product, such as? aluminum tubes for packaging these
cigars, aluminum cases, holders, rings, cedar boxes, ete. 7

3) Continuous complaints are received from foreign importers, ave to the
detection of high percentage of wormed cigars.

4) The traditional blends that gave charact-r to each of the traditional
brands have been changed and altered, which has resulted in the imaginable loss

of quality and prestige.

At first, it wai thought that ‘this wae ofly a manouvor for lover prices. by the
European importers, but, as tine pasied ard oupaTapaco could not place any salea,
the reports, which wore still coming @ given more credence. As a result
of this, I was sent. to‘conduct an on-the-spot investigation in Europe, and, sure.
enough, I discovered that the Poles wore indeed re-exporting our tobacco, with
complete disregard of their signed agreement with Cuba, The. violation was re=

ted to ‘the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade, which instructed CUBATABACO to
institute proteedings to recover:damages fromthe Poles. Cuba sued for {1 mile
lion and the Poles, ‘having being caught red-handed, offered a settlemmnt of
40,000 which was accspted. The paynent ‘was made in dollars, out of. the Polish-
Cuban clearing. Y

This “international solidarity" practiced by Communist countries kept Cuba,
for a long tine. (192-1963) from entering Western Turopean markets.

Dumping as practiced by these countries, tho Jack of adecquata atocka for
the Europeans! taste, difficulties and delays in deliveries (due to shortage of
ships) have made the Europeans shy avay from buying larger quantities of Cuban
leaf, and, any European importers have learned that Guba ie not a reliable
source of supply.

Dus to the above stated reasous, the Communist régime can barely place

1,° This quarter opened with an internal reorganization of
AMSCROLL becoming effective. The reorganization had been under=
taken in the interests of efficiency and economy, The Departments
of Labor, Women, Foroitgn Affairs, Coordination, and Youth were
abolished. This action got rid of largely ineffective people who
had been receiving salaries and will prevent dissipation of AMSCROLL
funds and energies. The new, stream-lined organization is better
able to concentrate upon the field it knows best: economic action.
With ite present staff it is also able to undertake action in
political, youth, and the other fields should this be desirable,

into four categories, They are economic activities, Pree World
shipping to Cuba, dissemtnation of Propaganda, and the AMSCROLL

The. first public surfacing known to the Station of this study. was i
a story that appeared in the Miami News on 26 September. This

story was prepared from an AH! z rele: that was mailed
to the AMSCROLL list of business people, bankers, and traders in~

the U.S., Euro: and Japan. id 7

Also during this quarter AMSCROLL released other studies: -
of an econosiie nature on such subjects as Cuban trade with Spain,
the status of the Cuban oil industry, and the failure of mechanizae
tion of the Cuban sugar industry. Tho bases of these studies wero
provided by the Station, often from information provided by qualified
refugees arriving via the air lift. In other cases, AMSCROLL
personnele~particularly AMFRAME~l-~would interview some of those pate

refugees.

publicize Free World shipping with Cuba, Each month a list is . -

for release to the ‘press, In addition, a special study was mado
‘wegarding the Greek firm Yranco Shipping Company. The wire services
regularly carry this information and 27 published stories on this
‘aubject in U.8., Canadian, and English publications came to the
Station's attention during this period. :

It may be of interest that the publication of the articl
cited in reference cost approximately $200.00 :

2. Through GUSPOT-2 Madrid Station nado contact with Iden

of economic reports concerning Spain and PBKUMEN. it was
agreed wih the directors of Identity that the articles vould

- be paid for at the same rate as paid advertisements; however +
they would appear as exclusive reports of Identity and bear
BO resemblance to a paid advertisement. Because of various.
legal ramifications, Identity agreed to publish only those

‘ articles which were signed. saaseet 7

“3. QUSPOT-2's approach to Identity vas made ostensibly
under the auspices of a PORUMEN exile group with whos he said
he was affilinted, tho headquarters of ehich ore ostensibly
in the JMWAVE area. It was agreed that the JMWAVE exile group
would furnish the material directly to Identity, with a copy
to QUSPOT-2, who, after receipt of the article, would thea
approach the directors of Identity to ascertain the price
of the article and push for its publication. Ia this regard.
Madrid would appreciate continuing with this practice for the

‘2. A result of QUSPOT-2's recent holiday in the JMWAVE area has
beon to establish a correspondence between him and. AMFRAME-1, the
signer of the Suplemento Especial of the AMSCROLL Economic Bureau, a
copy of which Te torenndod by separate cover,  QUSPOT-2 has indicated.
that ho could use AMSCROLL economic studies and that he could arrange
for publication of at least some of these in Identity A. He suggested:
that the original of such publications be sent to Identity B with a
copy to him, -This was done in the case of a recent economic report
which was shortly thereafter published in Identity A. QUSPOT-2 air=
mailed this story to AMFRANE-1 which arrived at about thé same time
as the copy the Madrid Station airmailed to the JHWAYZ overt address,

2, We wish that the article being forwarded by separate cover
also be surfaced in Identity A. The original has been airmailed to
Identity B with a copy to QUSPOT-2 per QUSPOT-2's suggestion. JMWAVE - °
foels that this is a useful mechanism and unless advised to the
contrary we propose to' forward additional AMSCROLL studies to Identity. B
for publication ip Identity A. Should Madrid prefer we, of course, can
an the future forward such articles directly to the Station for
placement instead of airmailing them to Identity B.

3. Studies similar to the one being forwarded are regularly
prepared in English on a number of economic subjects. They are
distributed to shipping firms, certain banks engaged in international
commerce, international trade organizations, international commodity
houses, ete, They are translated into Spanish solely for use in
Identity A; thus, in this sense, these reports are an “exclusive". _

OF RAUL DE RUA CiSTRO,=

My name {s Rail do la Ria Castro, and I vas the Chief Engineer atoard the Cuban MV
STERRA MESTRA until March 20, 1946, when I jumped ship in Maroran, Japan,

Working conditions in the Cutan Merchant:Fleet elso influenced my decision, I
could not stand the intensified espionage on board by merkers of the G-2. It is
worth mentioning that the plan to indoctrinate Cuban merchant crews was a complete
failure, The regime has atardoned the project altogether, an? io now trying to
place loyal Communists as officers and crowmembors, even if they are not qualified
for their jobs,

4s a matter of fact, the lack of qualified personnel 1s an increasing problem, and
another source of trouble aboard Cuban vesséls. During the lact months a total of
twenty nine officials, officers and crewmembers of the Cutan Herchant Narino have
defected (data of up-to-date merchant marine score), After I quit the SIERRA MAES
TRA, for instance,* “there was not a cingle certified enginesr on beard, although
there were several young fellows getting on the job training. Thie is a fact that
should be taken into consideration by the ‘insurance firms that underwrite Cuban

vessels, 2

Most of the vessels are faced with ali sorts of mechanical difficulties, due to
lack of spare parts and a very faulty maintainance, situation tkat gets worse when
consider the scarcity of qualified personnel just mentioned. i

Iam very happy to have Joined those of my fellow Cuban officers who preceded me
in this decision, I wish’ to thank the "Free Cutan Merchant Marine Committes" for
all the attentions accorded me, and I hope to rejoin our merchant fleet soon, when
our vessels again sail inder the flag of a free country.

Mi momre os Ravl do la Ria Castro y hasta ol 20 do marzo de 1966 desenpend ol
cargo dv Jefe de Miquinas do ia Yotonave SIERRA MAESTR 4) Cargo este que abandond

en Mererdn, Japdn, . =
Las ‘condiciones de trabajo cn la Marina Mercante Cubana fueron uno de los motivos

* que me Lievaron a tomar mi decisidn, Tampoco podfa continuar soportando el espio-

uaje ¥ 1s vigilancia a bordo por mienbros del G-2, Vale 1a pena mencicnar quo el
Plan de addctrinamiento para. los miembros de las detaciones de la flota rercante
cubans ha fracasado complotamonte. El rdgimen ha abandonado dicho plan y lo tinico
que hace ahora es sustituir a los que abandonamos los buques por personal “politi=
Caments apto", pero caronte do capacidad técnica para desempevtar los cargos.

De hecho, ol régimen confronta un serio probloma ante la escases de personal técnd
co capscitado y titulado, y dsto constituye otra fuente de problems a terdo de
los teques cubanos. Durante log ultimos moses un total de vointe y nueve funciona
rios, oficiales y tripulantes de la flota mercante cubana han abandonadg sus car=
@°s. Fara quo so tenga una idea sobre la gravedad de este problema resulta necesa
rio sexalar que después que yo abandond 61 SIERRA MIESTR1 no quedd a berdo un sdlo
mequinista con titulo, a pesar de quo varies michachos jévenes se encontratan alli
recibierdo entronamiento, poro por supuesto, an sin‘ol debido titulo, Esta es una
realiis? que debe cer considerada seriamente por las firmas aseguradoras da buques
cubands.

La mayerfa de los buques confrontan dificultades en lo referente al funcicnaniento
debido princlpalmente a la falta de piezas de repuesto y al nantonimiento defectug
80 ¥ poco eficiente y como os natural este problema se acentuva con la escases de
personal técnico capacitado en las dotaciones,

Deseo ranifestar que estoy contento de encontrarme junto a tantos otros cospajeros
de la Marina Mercante quo me han precedido y quiero agradecer publicanente al "Co-
mité de la Marina Mercante Cubana Libre" las atencionos que ha tenido conmigo, asf
como ia ayuda que me estan prestando, y sinceramente ‘espero poder volver a la Mard
na Marcante en un futuro préximo} cuando una vez mis podamos navegar bajo el. pabe~

car de “cadtica", La falta de personal técnico capacitado y de obreros especias
lizados hacen aue 1a operacién de produccién do los Ingenios sea altamente defile
eiente. Por otra parte, la falta de abastecimiento de cafia no permite que los’ 9
genios funcionen a su capacidad normal, trayendo como consecuencia poce eficien=
cia en el trabajo y un alto consumo de combustible adi¢ional, que ocasiona un ay
mento considerable en los costos de produceién del azdcar. En relacién con los
medios de transporte, orinci palmente los ferrocarrifes a@zucareros, deseamos acig
rar quo so encuentran tambidn on pésimas condiciones, a pesar de la adquisicidn
de locomotorss sovidticas, inglesas y francesas, pues las vfas férreas no permi-
ten el aprovechamiento de este material rodanto. Por ejemplo, durante 1965 se
debfen de haber cambiado seis millones de traviesas en las vfas férreas, mas sin
embargo s61o habfa diponibles ochenta mil. E1 resultado es e) incremento do los
descarrilamientos que durante la zafra de 1963 alcanzaron un promedio de tres deg
carrilamientos diarios, producidndose diez accidentes mortales.

Muchos me preguntan cual serd la preduccién final de 1a zafra de 1966 y so -
bre este punto debo hacer los comentarios siguientes; Fidel Castro anunci$ que

_ la meta azucarera de este aifo sérfan 6.5 millones de toneladas y ese anuncio no

6610 fue hecho vurante su discurso del lro. de mayo de 1965, sino que lo repitié

durante su discurso del 7 de junio del mismo aio. Sin embargo, se admite que dj

cha meta.no seré alcanzada, Ahora bien el estimado actual no excede de 5.1 mie

Lones de toneladas. Por qué?
Primeramente se debe mencionar la falta de abono, Este aiio la aplicacién
3 divisas necesarias pa-

ra adquirirlo, principalmente en Italia, E1 afio pasado, sin embargo, se aplica=

Fon aproximadamonte 450,000 toneladas. :
En segundo lugar, resulta necosario “hacer referencia 4 1as stombras de cafla, :

situada en los alrededores de Manzanillo y Bayamo, las cuales eran zonas arroce =

tas y ahora han {ntentado convertirlas en zonas cafioras resultando todo esto en

un fracaso pues la cafia es de baja calidad al no ser adecuado el suelo,. Otro fag

tor menos importante pero digno de darse a conocer es la falta de culdado en las

casez de mano de 9

tareas de cultivo y atencién de los cafisveraies debido a 1:

bra.
Con estos antecedentes es que hay que analizar e] monto de la presente zafra,

Durante 1965 ol dfa 7 de abril se alcanzé el cuarto millén, pero este afio ol ter- -
cor millén se alcanz6 el dfa 3 de abril lo cual ya significa un atraso de corca
de 900,000 toneladas. Creo que hay cafia para llegar a 5.1 millones de toneladas
ahora bian, lo que hay que preguntarse es si dicha meta, que ya estd bastante. por
debajo de los 6.3 millones anunciados por Fidel Castro seré alcanzada 0 no. EL
Partido estS realizando una movi lizactén masiva record hacia los cafiaverales con
e1 propésite do intentar cortar toda.la cafia pero eso hay que ver si en dofini-
tiva lo bgran hacer. :

Cabe hacer referencia en este momento a lo que se conoce en Cuba por el nog
bre de “Pian Perspectivo Azucarero", que es el tinico plan econdmico que tiene en

estos momentos e1 gobierno de Cuba.

eQué es el “Plan Perspectivo Azucarero”? comprende tres puntos bésicos que
son los siguientes 1 primero, la "rehabilitacién" de 1a capacidad industrial @ nj
voles pre-Castros segundo, la "ampliacién” de la capacidad industrial: y tercero,

la “concentracién” de 18 industria azucarera en 70 modernos centrales.
Vamos a revisar brevemente los tres puntos a la luz de la presente situacién.
En relacién con el primero, 0 sea, la “rehabili tacién® de la capacidad industrial _ : iz
“Instalada, es necesario destacar que en 1952 1a capacidad de produccién de la in ;
dustria azucarera era de siete millones de toneladas, pero debido a la escasez
de plezas de repuasto, falta de materiales para las reparaciones, baja calidad de
las reparaciones y la eliminacién de seis ingenios + que fueron precisamente deg
mantelados para utilizar las plezas como“repuestos lo cual ce ha comprobado ha si.
do un error més - la capacidad industrial se ha reducido a sélo seis millones de

aJecutar dicha ampliacién - también se dete decir que tampoco son suficientes los

técnicos para realizar de por s{ las laberes ordinarias de la zafra con la actuat!

coordinaci én ambos organismos y por consiguiente 1 INRA manda a sembrar cafla en

donde no existe caracidad industrial y por su parte 61 MINAZ estd “rehabilitando"

Angenios en donde 2 lo mejor ya no hay suficiente cafla. Esto es sélo una mestra
de la desorganizacién reinante, desorganizacién que unida a los factores. renciona

Ancapacidad de la planificacién econéinica de las altas esferas en dicho gobierno,

(Por clarte que la construéeién del nuevo Ingenio es vital para el éxito del

Plan” y hasta el momento presente s4lo una firma francesa ha hecho ofertas para

dicha construceién, dicha firma es nada menos que 1a FIVES-LILIE, bien conocida

en los efrculés azucareros).

~~ —"es Fidel Castro, ~

ve gustarfa hacer una breve referencia en relactén con otro problema bésico
+ 1a baja cal idad del aztcar cubano, tanto crudo como refino, actualmente en proce
80 de empeorarse, Esto no ha sucedido de casualidad sino como consecuencia de 1a
falta y mala calidad de las piezas de repuesto, la ineficiencia en la operacidn de
los ingenios, 1a falta de eficiencia de los trabajadores, ya baja calidad de los
productos quimicos auxilieres procedentes' de pafses socialistas. “Estos problemas
estén resultando en una decreciente polarizacién del azticar, e1 envase defictente
del azicar de exportacién, el aumento de impurezas en el azdcar embarcada a granel,
y las dificultades en cumplir los compromisos de entregas de azucares,

Otro tema de interés lo constituye la presencia de los “téenicos azucareros"
soviéticos en Cuba. E1 régiten cuenta en 1a actualidad con unos 300 téenicos azu=
careros sovi¢ticos quienes ue supone que sean los sustitutos de los técnicos cuba=
fos que han abandenado e}. pafs. Los téenicos soviéticos tienen muy poca experien=
cia en azicar de cafia y la forma en que dicha industria opera en Cuba. Ademss muy
pocos hablan espafiol y esto les hace atin mds diffcil su labor. Por lo tanto ni los
técnicos soviéticos ni los equipos soviéticos constituyen una solucién para el que :
bradero de cateza azucarero de Fidel Castro.

Con esto deseo dar por terminada estas declaraciones, Dejo ahora la palabra a
los miembros de la prensa para contestarles ‘cualquier pregunta en relacién, no s6~
loa mis palabras, sino a la situad én polftica interna que es un interesante feng
meno de desintegracién, la odisea ‘de mi familia, el problema de la Universidad en
donde desempefiaka una cétedra, asf como cualquier otro tema que resulte de interés.

Muchas graciss.

Dear Prof, Gardlundt

leased to enclore tho informtion that you requested
in your kind letter xe 5/5/66 which I hope will be useful to you in your etuiies
of price and cost trends in the cane sugar industry,

As you probably know, tho Cuban surar industry ranked first
place as a producer of cane sugar, not only with rogards to largo production vole
umes, but also as concerns high technical officioncy and low production costs.

Bofore 1959, the maxima production’ cost was of 3,5 cents a
pound, excepting, of course, the srallor and moro inofficiont sugar mills that
had not dovolopod any tochnological advancos since World War IT, However, in
1965 the cost. of production was as hiph as 5,25 cents a pound, even though, of
course, this latter figure is carefully concealod by. the Communist régim: that

“ yules my country.

I would like to acquaint you with the Economie Research Bu=
reau of the UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA Movonont. This organiaation is mado up of true
Cuban oconomiats in exile. I am sure that you will find this a very valuable
{source of information concerning Cuba's cconony,

+ I thank you very mich for tho kind and hunane phrases that
you have had for my family and for myself. Thank Heaven, after throe long years
we were able to escapo, oven if at the risk of our own lives, from the Commnist
hdl, We have como to this free land in tho hope that we can start our lives all
over again under the kind hospitality of this groat Nation, the free and denocrag

Dear Mr. Lozanos

We address you now on account of the fotlure of the current Cuban
suger harvest, of which failuro you must hove heard not o=ly through our’ "Eco=
homie Intollicence Report”, but aleo from your own sources.

7 © For axamole, the June 10, 196 MerrileLynch bulletin, sets the g
mount of the current Cuban auger harvest st 4,4%0,000 MT, that 6, over 2 million
metric tons below the coal ennounced by Fidel Castre (6,500,000 1), This will ,
rosult 4n 6 scarcity of Cuban suger, wich scarcity will make it very  é4fFicult
for the reoine to fulfill ‘ts suger commitments. to free-world countries, such as
Spain.and Morecco, and at tho eame time to cope with o significant percentage of
the Japanese sugar market, Tho enclosed Memo contains data that may te of intg

rest. to you.

The racent transactions whereby Prazil sold 330,000 MT is tangible
‘evidence of the opportunity that’ existe for free countries in the Americas at
thie timé, thanks to tho failure of the Cubsn sugar harvests

Tt would be extremely rewarding for Colombia to exnlere the inmg
diate possibilities that eixst in those threa markets, as surely some transag
tions could be made that would benefit your country, and which, et the sane tine,
would’ block some of the Cartro-Communists’ own transactions, The letter ore in
themselves difficult becsuso of the scarcity brought about by the failure of the
1966 sugar harvest.

It {ts quito possible that we could cooperate with this Coloabien
endesvor, by informing you of facts we learn concerning the situation in such mag
kets (Spain, Morocco and Japan), markets a6 well as by any personal undertaking,

‘which we could be capable ofs



Likewise, 1f you have any rublication issued by your Assoctation
that you eculd mail to us requiarly, re would apnrecsate your deine so, and if
you wore able to use the atateronts hy Eng. Esparza and Dr. Tarrab in some art}

Cle, wo would like ot obtain a copy of it,

: Honing to hear from you socn, and with the certainty that. any ag
tion on your part “ill mean 8 victory for Colombia as well as for the free Cubans,

RENN REQURED RETERETCES

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1. Beoxinning with the broadcast for 19 Octobor 1965 the Station
at its request began recoiving a summary of cach AMSCROLL AMTHIGH
program, We forward by separate cover theso summaries through the
evening of 20 January 1966 (with tho excoption of the periods of
28-30 November and 2=4 January for which no summary. was prepared).
Henceforth those summaries will be forwarded on an at least bi-weekly

basis.

2. The Station is attempting to improve both the punch and the
quality of these programs, We beliove, for example, that more
emphasis should be placed upon. regime failures.and upxn tho needless
economic moss. Further, we are trying to refine tho “irritability”
factor so far as Castro and the regime are concerned due to the
sensitivity of Castro to this type of attack. Calling Castro (on
19 January) the "Soviets' barking hound dog" is-a sally in this

direction,

3. As usual with programs of this nature the size and reaction of
the audience is most difficult to ascertain, It is somo comfort to be
able to record that during this period 10 letters have been received
by AMSCROLL that have beon inspired by.this program, The President's
uncle, Carlos Dorticos, told AMSCROLL-3 that he had been a frequent
listener to this program and that he had listened to this program at
his home the night before he left Cuba,

"the foar that the U.f. my alter ite rolatione with Cuta ie unfounded (and) there
4o no prospect for a change in our relations", We arrive at the conclusion that U.S.

policy on tho subject will no vary: Cac'ro will be oconomically strancled and there

is no future for Comminiam in thie Continent.

"What About Political Priconers?",- Fidel Castro has takon a rorion of steps that

the Ieland. Evon though no public etatomente hve been mite rhout the political
prironors, it may be expocted that thin mtter han boon considerod in the nogotia-

of Food Industry. Lots of bureaucrats, Tons of paper. Milcs of Red tape. But,

still, no food!

fIntriguc: about tho Tri-Continent1 Conference",= Ben Farka, the metermind of the

‘Tri-Continental Conference schoduled for Hhvana, myrteriously dinapporred in Fare.

We renombor that, whon 1t was thought that this conference would be held in Algoria

Tho character who took up Cho's role in thie Conference, Ben Bark, now vanishes in
Parie. Could 1t be that what happened to Bon Holla is about to happen to Fidel?

November 3, 1965: "How Abijcot Can Castro Hol".- In hie recent statement to three

Amerionn and one Spanish journalists, Castro appenrn arrorant and acte as though he

didn't care for an "aggiornamonto' with the U.S. However, from the context of his

statomonto it is quite obvious thit he would like nothing botter than being re-ainit-

‘is attitude must have boon a terrible disappointmont to his followers, who met
necoscarily seo it as evidence that the U.*.°.R. is in full retreat in its economic

war with the U.S. over Cuba. :

Instead,

Rafael, etrengthened by Mo:cow's backing, hia pointed out, though in a rathor subtle

manner, the action of the unknown mon of tho Farty in tho atruggle against Castroism,

This he did when he indircctly chargol that Castro war a petty-burgeoie.

"Caetro Coupht big Finecre on the Si 10 SJann Noge".= Because

his situation is more difficult every day, Castro hinted that his convereations on

ively

the Cutan exodus meant the beginning of déoper negotiations wth tho U.S. This is

of the U.f, to all Cubans, he left it well establiched that this was done because of

Novenber 9, 1965: “what Goes From Oné Nova 7th te the Cthert.~ We recall that on
Nov. 7, last year, Castro was interviewed by a corree;ondent for the New York Times.
At the same time, he eaid that he would down whatever American U-2 planes he could

with thig surface-to-air antiaircraft miseiles, He alco said that he would uce

“hat About Latin Ancrican Conmunist Parties?".- Castro dismissed the fact that

Chinn did not greet the reormnization and change of the Cuban Commnist ‘arty, but

spite and concern were obvious in the tone of his voice. Cas'ro knows that be has

botrayed China. Qn the other hand, the Communist Parties of Latin Amorica have not
addrosred Castro any congratulrtory mosenges either, which indicates that they are
beginnning to turn their backs on him on account of his "purging" of the old guard.

Under such conditions, Castro's subservience to Moscow is greater every day, Castro

has entered the most uneurmountable phase of his crisis,

After Castro returned from Morcow in 1963, and

a coexistence between Castro and the U.S.

under prescure from Krruchchev, he bepan his first conciliatory overtures with the United

ftates, Nikita had pleaded geographical and economic imposeibility to maintain his com

Castro and the-U.S., on kar part, rejectyCactro-Conmniem. In face of thie eituation,
the men in the Cuban’ armed forces ani in the government have only one dignified course

A Cuban okipper who left his ship in Jaan Doc, 26 confirmed today in tilami that =
Cnotro's logistical support of Viet Nam Rods was tho main reason for his defection,
In a procs conference held at the Biscayne Room of tho Hotel HcAllictor, Francisco.
Cobas, the defecting captain of the Cuban freighter "Aracelio Iglooias", told news-
mon why he and three of his fellow officers decided to seek asylum in the United --

States,

The preso conference waa arranged by UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARTA, a Miami-based Cuban ==
group whom Cobas approached upon his arrival from Japan, Cobas eaid that he had —
acked tho U.R. to help him get in touch with the prose eo that he and his shipmates
could donounce Cuban maneuvers to help the Viet Cong.

During the conference, Cobas was flanked by Antonio Arias, Vario Pérez and Huxberto
Forndndoz, tho three other defecting officers of the "Aracelio Iglepilas", Cobas, ~
Antroduced by U.R. Secrotary General Mario Seiglic, spoke for the group, Said Com
bag that he and his shipmates had refused torun tho risko of transporting war mate=
rialc to North Viet Nam, particularly since they were convinced that such transpor-
tation was wrong. Coban added that all Cuban veusola have been ordered to take mi}
itary eupplies to North Viet Nam from other Asian Communict ports, and that the Cub
an Embassy in Tokyo serves as coordinator for ali much shipments,

Reforring to his former ship, Capt. Cobas explained that the Embaesy had ordered -~
the “hracelio Iglesias" to afi to a Horth Koroan port and to await further instrug
tions there. Tho Cuban diplomats withheld the ship's itinerary and declared that -
tho "Aracelio" vould return: to the Japanese port of Yahata before proceeding to =~

to deceive the crew and reassure the Japanese ac to the cargo and tho use to vhich =

Tho Cuban skipper referred to ill-treatment of Cuban coamen by the Castro regime,
mentioning among other. inotances the constant spying on board by G-2 meng prefer--
ential Customs treatment given Comriunist-Bloc sailorsgand the ridiculously low lo=
cal-currency allowance of 45 per week given to tho Cutane while in foreign ports.
Elaborating on the isdue of ecpionage, Capt. Cobas revealed that the radio and tele

that the two-basic problems confronted by Cuban chipping aro tho obsolete Soviet --

from the coztly effects of th Comtunists' unreliability,

Capt. Fraiicisco Cobas then revealed that he understood that a vast “reorganization”
of the Cuban Havy wa undertaken early this fell, Moct officers, he said, were dig
charged on the grounds of suspected "disloyalty" to the government. Incidentally,

added Cobas, some rotired Army officers who have had no naval oxperience, have also

sion to quit was made of their own free will and that no one had pressured them --
into it, lle denounced Communist oppression of his homeland and said that ho and his

Following Capt, Cobas' atatesent, the newsmon avked Him numerous questions. Most =
of thece referryd to the iscue of Cuban boate being used to carry var supplies to -

Un capitdn cubano que abandond su nave en Japén el 26 de dicionbro confirm hoy
on Miami que el epoyo logfstico de Castro a los rojos de Viet Nam habfa sido el prin
cipal motivo de su desercidn, Mn una conferencia de prensa colebrada en un céntrico
hotel de esta cluded, Francisce Cobas, capitan del carguero cubano “Aracelio Iglesias"
explicd a los periodistas por qué é1 y sus compafioros de oficialidad decidieron soli-
eitar acilo en los EEUU. :

La conforencia do prensa fué convocada por UNIDAD REVOLUCICNARIA, organizacion cu
bana radicada aquf a la que se dirigid Cobas a su llegada del Japén. Cobas dijo que
habia solicitado la aytda de U.R, a fin de ponerse en contacto con los periodistas y
denunolar las maniobras de Cuba Roja en favor de los rojos vietnamitas,

Durante la conferencia, se encontraban junto a Cobas los otros tres cficiales asi~
ledos, nonbrados Antonio Ruiz Arias (Primer Oficial), Mario Julio Pérez Girén (Jefe
de Ndquinas), y Huiberto R; Fornandez (Sobrecargo), El capitin Cobas fue presentado
por.el Dr, Marlo Seiglie, Secretario General de UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA.

Dijo Cobas que tanto 61 como sus compafieros de tripulacién se negaban a correr el
riesgo que supone transportar material bélico a Viet Iam del Norte, maxime cuando a =
brigaban la conviceién de que dicha actitud del gobierno cubano es altavente condena
ble, Affadid Cobas que todos los buques cubanos tienen érdenes de llevar suministres
de guerra a Viet Nem del Norte desde otros puertos conunistas del Asia, y que la Bnba
jada cubana en Tokyo funge como coordinadora de tales enbarques,

Refiriéndose al "Aracelio Iglesias", que capitaneaba, Cobas revelé que la Brbaja-
da cubana en Japén habfa dispuesto que el “Aracelio" zarpare rumbo a un puerto norco.
reano y aguardara allf nuevas érdenes. Los diplomaticos castristas retuvieron el iti
nerario del buque y declararon que el mismo volverfa al puerto japonés de Yahata an =
tos de seguir rumbo a Viet Nam dol Norte. Al hacer ver que el buque regresarfa al Ja
pon, los comunistes se proponfan engafiar a la tripulacién y tranquilizar a las autor,
dades japonesas respecte del carganento del buque y del uso que so iba a dar al miso,
La realidad, empero, era que, durante 1a estancia del "Aracelio" en Corea del Korte,
el miso habréa de recibir la ordan de cargar un enbarque de material bélico y zarpar


“te

diroctamente hecia Viot Nam dol Norte.

Sogiin Cobas, esto no pudo hacorse debido a que, a fitima hora, 1a Bubajada reed
bad el aviso de que el Puerto. norcoreano de Chinnanpé estaba bloquoado por ol hielo,
Wh vista do ollo, so ordend al "Aracelio" lovar anclas rumbo a Shanghai para reco »
gor alif otro carganento do material de guerra y conducirlo al Viet Nam, Fué enton
es que Cobas y sis compafieros decidieron abandonar el buque,

A continuacién, Cobas pasd a axplicar que el apoyo logfstico a los Viet Cong ~
constituye una de Ins tareas encomendadas al mevo enbajador cubano en Tokyo, un com
munista fanitico nonbrado Manuel Jorge Cuervo Nonéndez que tuvo 4 su cargo la adni-
nistracién de varios campos de concentracion on Isla de Pinos,

Refiriéndose a los malés tratgs que recibon los marinos cubanos, Cobas monciond
la constante vigilancia a quo ostin sonetidos a bordo por ol G-2 comunista, asf como
a las consideraciones éspectalos de aduana que se dan a los tripulantes de buques de
otros paises comunistas y a la ridfcula cantidad ($5 semanales) en moneda local que
se da a los marinos cubanos para sus gastos en puertos extranjeros, Dotallando la
cuestign de la vigilancia, revold ol capitin Cobas que on 1a itayorfa de los buques
cubanos el G-2 do a bordo suelo ser ol radiotelegrafista, Como capitan del “Arace.
lio’ Iglesias", el propio Cobas co vio obligado a entregarlo'a otro agente policfaco
dostacade a bordo toda 1a corrospondencia de ciertes tripulantes supuestanente des-

leales al réginon,

Tanbi én dijo Cobas. a los periodistas que los principales problemas que confronta
1a navogacién cubana los constituyen los equips soviéticos anticuados instalados en
muchos buques y las complicaciones y confusiones ‘tburecraticas. Como ejemplo de esto
Wltimo, sefiald Cobas que la agencia oficial de compras del. réginen cubano casi munca
comunica a la coordinadora do fletes (CUFLET) la fecha en que debord cargarse alguna
mercancia en puerto extranjero, Dicha fecha no se avisa hasta Ultima hora, fracasan

Ref: 210


MOVIMIENTO UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA

ty chdpmitor and I have requested political seylum from the United Ftates
because wo aro convinced that Cutan support of the Com-unist war in Vietnam is
wrong and ve refuse tu run tne ricks of transporting var natertal to North Viet
Nam, : .

All Cuban ships have orders to carry cargo te North Vietnam to help the
North Vietnamese war effort, The Cuban Embassy in Japan is acting as the coor=
dinator for all shipments of war material to North Viotnam via Cuban ships from
Communist ports in Asia, The Cutan Embassy in Tokyo had secretly arranged for
tho fracolio Iglosias to take a shipmont of war materials from North Korea to
North Viotnam, In order to hide their intentions, the Embassy arranged that the
feacelio itinorary be kept up in the air until the last possible moments then to
fool the orew and the Japanese they gave tho story the ship would return to Japan
to lead tin cargo at Yahata and thon proceed on route to North Vietnam, In reale

ity, wo wero to receive instructions on itinerary while in North Korea telling
us to proceed directly to North Vietnam after loading tho war supplies.
At the last moment, however, tho Embassy was informed that the port of
- Chinnampo wae blocked by fee. Tho Cuban Enbsssy thon hastily arranged for ue to :
pick up a shipment of arms in Shangai previously scheduled for another Cuban
boat about the ond of January. i
Logistical support to tho North Viotnamese is one of the two tasks assigned
to Mr, Manuol Jorge Cuerya,. the now Cuban Anbassador to Japan, His other func=
tion ie to erase the bad effects on Japanese-Cuban trade caused by the defection
of the former trade Counselor to Japan, Gilberto Uerany. The Cuban governnent
ie very concerned about the prospect of declining trade einco already sone comp=
anies that formerly traded with Cuba, will no longer do so openly.

In gencral, I may say that members of the Cuban merchant marine live under
unbearable conditions, The treatment we receive is vo bad that no one foale
like cooperating with the marine purposes of the regime, even in the few cases
where there might be no ideological incompatibility involved.

As examples of this treatment I may nention the constant spying on board
For some reason, the "C-2".man on board is usually the
In the "Argcelio" we had one by the name of Eduay

by members of the "G-2",
radio and telegraph operator,
do Sanchez who was a notorious spy. Aboird we had another oe called Manuel Ria
Rodiigues who was imposed as the Fourth Sngineer, even though he had no training

or ability to perform such duties, 1s Captain of the "Aracelio", I vas ordered

by tho governont ehipping concern "Yazticas" to give Rua all possible ccopsrat~
fon in the fulfillment of his functions, Ra then camo to see me and acked,
among other things, that I surrerder to him tho incoming and outgoing rail of
cortain apecific crewmen who were euszected of toing arainst the governnent.
"another tnatance of t11+treatnent which Culan scamon resent 19 the discrin
nation to which we are subject by tre Cutan Cuctoms ac compared to the preferre-
tial treatment they accord to foreign eailors, particularly those from behind
the {ron curtain, Yost ovorything we tring from abroad to alloviato tho scarcity
suffered by our familion fa confiscated at the Customs House,

St411 othor reasons for diegust aro the rany cute and élecounts made from ou!
already low pay and, very especially, the fidiculously lov anount of forelgs cut
rency that we are allowed when we eaii atroaé, For spending money in foreign.
Ports, all we got in Jecal currency 1e the equivalent of % per week which, of
course, aro deducted from our basic sslaries, In applying this restriction, no
distinction 1s made between the erewren or the various officer ranks, It 19. $5

for everyone.
Because of all this, and becauce of the terrible conditions under which

_ Communism kéops our homeland, nost Cutan sailore and officers aro staunch anti-

Communists. The Government knows thie, but nevertheless they must employ what
they call "the reactionaries" because of the scarcity of other trained personnel
to man Cuban boats, Their only choice 1s to apy on us constantly, as I Have
just explained,

As to the operating conditions of the Cuban merchant fleet, it 19 vorth
mentioning that.Polish ships, which raze yp a sizable proportion of Cuban ship=
ping, are supplied with Soviot-made squiprent which the Russtans have long dis-
carded as obsolete, Again, my own ship is an example, The "Aracelio” veo come
pleted aa recently as 1963 ina Polish shipyard, Yet, ite radar equipnent 1s 60
obsolete that it is simply not used, since we could never find the parts to re=
pair it when it broke. A German technictan told my Chief Mate here that it must
have been a World-War II unit. :

Excessive bureaucratic red tape ané disorganization is another serious
problem confronted by Cuban shipring acé which often results in considernble
damage to those firms that trade with the Castro tyranny. I will illustrate
thia. The Cuban government agency reepcnsible for arranging maritime tremnspor-
tation for merchandise bought abroad 1s the "Empresa Cubana de Fletos" (CUFLET).


{
i

-3-

The governrent purchasing organization buye morchardise from foreign companios,
but fails to inform CUFLET of the dato on which tho cargo is to be loadod. ALL
atterpts to establich this arg to no avail, Then one day the buying agency
cerves last-ninute notice that the merchandice will be ready for loading.

CUFLET takes pains to find a versol in time but, moro ofton than not, ite hasty
offorts aro in vain, In the moantino, tho seller abroad grovs impatient, as he
has long fulfilled his part of the doal and must continue to pay warchouse costa
because of a delay that {sno fault of his,

This happens all the timo, to the extent that many foreign firms refuse to
deal with such an undopendable customor as the Cuban government, or, foreseeing
the damages they may come to thon because of such inefficiency they impose the
harshest colling terus, .

The unrest and chaos that I havo deceribed 19 not peculiar to the merchant
fleet. Ido not know many details about thie because I have been out at sea most
of the timo since I first heard of St, but T understand thet the Cuban Navy was
alco in such turmoil that practically all ite officors vere discharged early ihis
fall. It is said that sone of tho dicmiceed naval officers were aceigned to the

merchant rarine, and my man and I know a few instances. It is even true that

. Ayny officers with no naval experience are being appointed to high naval post~

tions, However, it is nost likely that many of the purged officere will have
been shot or imprisoned, Such ie the Cuba of today.

Lastly, we wish to emphasize that our decision to scek asylum in the United
States,has been made of our ovn freo will, 'o have been pressured into this decs
sion by no one. Our consciences no longer permit us to serve tho cause of a Cop
munist Cube, Like hundreds of Cubans before us, we who love Cuba deeply cannot

longer endure the tyranny with which she is afflicted.
We appreciate with all our heart the help received from UNIDAD R'VEUCINARIA

and we also wish to thank the gentlemen of the Press assembled here, for the at=

tention given us,

Francisco Cobas.

AR: FYI
REF: DIR-53981, 28 October 65

As Headquarters is aware, JMWAVE is refuting on a con-
tinuing basis and via all appropriate assets commentaries
similar to that discussed in the reference, As for this
particular GOMEZ broadcast the Station prepared a guidance
for AMSCROLL use, primarily its radio, the point of which
was that GOMEZ had become eligible for the "Foot 'n Mouth
Club" due his admission on 21 October that Camarioca was a
plebiscite and his statement on 22 October, no doubt as a
-result of a prod from his Communist superiors that "I think
I made excessive concessions ..." explaining that the people
are really leaving due to economic reasons. We agree and
say that the economic reasons are to obtain three meals a
day, to be able to walk into a market and buy eggs and milk.
The guidance ends with this:' "You may take your foot out of
your mouth now, GOMEZ".

ATOR REO ROR

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

a 1. We forward under separate cover subject publication which was
recently sent to AMSCROLL mail recipients interested in economic
materinl, In producing this study a particular effort was made to
keep it objective and factual on the theory that in the case of sugar
the facts speak for themselves and need only tu be pulled together.

We also believe that objective material similar to the attached should
over a period of time enhance the reputation of the AMSCROLL economic
section as a serious and objective outfit that secks to discredit whe

Castro regime by publicizing the truth.

2. The Station would appreciate Neadquarters' reaction to this
publication. Additional copies are available should distribution via
KMFORGET or other means be desired,

3, It may be of interest to report that a copy of the attached
report has been mailed to Identity, currently in Geneva where he is
represonting his company at the sugar conference. This was done
directly under the AMSCROLL economic section letterhead and via
AMWORD-1's brother, an employee in the research department of

Identity's company,

l.- Cuba continues desperate attempts sel] _sugar.- ‘The Cuban sugar monopoly, CUBA=

ZUCAR, on September 6 concluded a sale of 5,000 tons of raw sucar for October 1965

delivery to the Iranian sugar organization. Tho origin of this sugar was hidden in
that it was declared to have originated in the Caribbcan, including Peru, excluding
Brazil. Market reports were-correct in stating that the country of origin was in ~

fact Cuba, The price agreed to was 18 pounds sterling per ton (Cand F) less 5 --=
shillings per ton to cover the expensos of the tender, This doal was engineered by
Westzucker of Dortmund, an organization also selling Cuban sugar to Jordan and which

wishes to keep its name out of these sales,
Another interesting development in Cuba's sugar selling activities during tho month

of September was quoting sugar for futuro delivery at or under the London spot = =
price on the day the offer was made. In other words, Cuba is offering sugar under

the world market. value, wIGROFILMED
act 2 01985

Example of this were:

Switzerland Sept 9 ~ 10,000 18-10-0 2h dan '66
United Kingdom - 10,000 18-15-0 21.55 Sept

It is difficult to explain this curious behavior in terms other than Cuba's desper~
ate need for foreign exchange. These sales at these prices can only result ina <
net loss to Cuba due to Cuba's inefficient sugar production. This loss will be com
pounded should the present upward trend of world sugar futures continuo (the New -
York price for world sugar on Caribbean port basis has gone from £1.60 on September

1 to 22,10 on September 27).

2.~ Free Shinn’ - Twenty Western vessels called on Red Cuban ports
during the past month of August. The trend continues downward; the August 1963 tg
tal was 24, and the one for August 1964 was 41, which means a decrease of 51%, when

August 1965 (20 vessels) is comparéd to August 1964.
Great Britain led the "maritime fifth columnists" with 11 vessels, followed by Leb-

anon, Greece, France, and Italy with 2 vessels each, and Cyprus with one.

Already 852 vessels are being kept out of the Red Cuba trade by its owners or opera

October confirm last month's report that an increase in boycott activities against
vessels flying the flags of countries still trading with Communist Cuba.

6.~ Japanese Trade Mission gets "chilly" reception in Latin America due to Red Cuba
deals.- A Japanese Trade Mission, headed by tir, Kazue Kitagawa, President of "Sumi
tomo Electrical Industries" came under fire while touring Mexico, Venecuela, Brazil,
“argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and,Peru, Latin Americans brought up matter that Japan

was indirectly financing subversion by providing Castro with an average of $1 mil--
lion dollars a month for the last 4 years. Japanese were told to choose between the

Red Cuban market and the Latin american market.

Some examples follow: article by L. Rojas Ospina in "Excelsior", Mexico, Sep, by
1965; in Brazil, a speech by Congressman Flaviano Riberiro dated Sop.’ 4, 1965, and
an article by Gustavo Corcao published in "Diario da Noticias", Rio de Janeiro, Sep.

for the Recovery of the artistic and Cultural Heritage of their country was able to

block Cestro's attempt to se]i art works and raise $2 million dollars, Cuban edles

mood Mowlazadeh, contained religious and funeral pieces, but case #107, forwarded

from Switzerland, contained solid gold and silver objects.
Ttalian Customs hsve impounded Castro's "treasure".

8.- Castro "shaky" j»~ After the "defog
tions" of Luis Ricardo Alonso - Ambassador to England -, Gilberto R. Alemany -Trade
Councollor in Japan-, and several members of: the Cuban "Muse Hall" playing in Pa
ris, the regime recalled its Ambassador to Prague, Armando Flores Ibarra, and the -
following members of the Cuban Embassy in London: Maria Fernandez, Osmani Martines
Vazquez, Moises Dias, Nario-Garcia, and Armando Lobeto,

Meanwhile, different rumors plegued Guba (many of them stemming from official state
ments): attempts on Castro's life, internal dissontion resulting from the "ultima--
tum" given to militiamen to return weapons; new boatloads of Cubsn refugees arriving

to Floridian shores; and Security Police Chief Valdes’ statements zeroing-in against:

“terrorism, sabotage, and resistance".

We attach herewith a reproduction of an article from the Caracas
newspapor El Universal of 10 September describing the organization
of 2 committee of European shippers to fight the discrimination
these shippers fancy they suffer in Latin America, We are curious
why such a group should be organized and to what purpose. Could this,
for example, be a reaction to the efforts to boycott ships that trade
. with Cuba? The Station will appreciate Headquarters' comment if it
appears that this group may become important and if it is or will be

from ite trade with Japan,”

A highly illustrative exanple 4s the case of Venezucla,

a 1.- Yenezuolat Trade Rolations with Jazan ard Communint attaczn.

@e~ Japan was able to obtain US% 133.5 aillion for tho period 1958-
1963 from its favorable trade balance with Venezuela, Tho favorable result in tho
trode balance for the Jan-Jul 1964 pericd totaled UE} 12.4 million,

: Recently, C. ITOH ard HIT.CHI clesed inportant agrecnente with
i ‘ the Venezuelan Phone Co., and C. ITOH was able to get en irportant contract with
: a "Corporation Venszclana de Potréloo",

b.- On tho other hand, Venczucla is considered by all oxperts a9 a
price target of Conmunion. The important arns caché discovered in Pararunr ‘0.
varde the ond of 1963, prompt tho Verozuclan cwvermment to accuso the Cas’
mullet régine during the IX Meoting of Porcign Affairs Vinisters of the Ac
on July 26, 1964. Since this incident, cuxcreua subvercivo activities have ¢
great loses to both the Poople and the goverraont of Venezuela, and to foretza --
firne ae voll.

Seutoerent | Lees than a month ago, another izportant arns cache was dice
ered in Los Tequea, Miranda State; and once core the hard of Castro-Commnis:1
traced and found.

G.= Then, whon tho situation ic fully analyzed, it fo a fact that
_ Venezuelan hard currency goes to Japan, ard froa there it goon to Castro, in order



to aid torroricm against tho Vonozuolen Pacple, the danocratic government, itr <=
businessmen, and oven Japanese interests in that country. Isn't thia a completo
Mogi oporation? ‘

2e- The Organization of Arericna Staten (Cis).

On July 26, 1964, tho OAS, during the IX Mecting of Foroign Affaira
Mintetore of the Asoricas, hold in ashington, D.C., dondeanod the Castro-Ccisrus
nist rogino and roquosted from itc monbor-countries, and from all free world ccuns
tries outeide tho Homlcphero, to coase diplozatic ard trado relations with Cuba.

3e~ The Inter-American Yorkers Creanizntjon (ORIT),

During its VI Continental Congross, held in Voxieo City, on Febr:
6, 1965, recommonded the maritimo boycott which was already in progrooe ursicr tho
Jeadorahip of tho. Vonozuclan dockvorkors.

Racontly, after 17 veosele hive suffered tho boycott, a statozent,
mado by international labor leadora during the IV Congreas of Venozuelan Dockwarit-
ers, hold in Caracaa from October 9 to October 13, 1965, reaffirmed tho boyco!.t.
Japanoso voseols have boen boycotted due to this defensive reacure of the workura
of this Homophere.

4e= Tho Management Boycott.

The Chambor of Commerce of the Asericas, during its XV Annual Conven=
tion hold in Miami, Pla., U.S.A., adopted a resolution on June 16, 1965, along the
gaze lines of tho OAS ard ORIT reconmondations, Since then, a Manageront Beycott

- Cornittee has boon formed, and already about three dozens of Latin Azorican Chic

bers of commerce support this campaign.

5. Public Opinion.

‘Tha Japanese Trade Mission that toured Latin America left behind tho
following reaction:

a. Moxico: Article "América Latina, Japén y Castro" by doctor Lao~
poldo Rojas Ospiiia, publighed by "Excelsior" on Soptembor 4, 1965

bem Brazil: Article "Japan Halps Fidel Castro" by Gustavo Coreno,
published by "Diario de Noticias", on Septender 2, 1965.

Article "Japan and Latin Azorica" by Mircea Buoscu, Fublished by
Diaric de Notid as", on Soptonbor 9, 1965.

G.= Peru: Congressman Ricardo Tezoche Bonitez pointed out Japan's ate
titude, due to its trade rolations with Comzunist Cuba during a spoech mado in Coa
grese on September lat., 1965. Congroasmen Tenocho's statezonte recolved art
coverage in tho local press and were object of an “igonce France Proase” wiro.

Chile: The leading "El Iarcurio" newspapor devoted one of its
editorial extisios de during | Septenber 1965 to point out the sace thing.

AND_ SUGGESTIONS 5
hy= Conclusion: oe
l.= Japan is prosently aiding Castro-Commnism, : 7

2.~ Japan 4s highly dependent of Latin Axoriea in onder to achieve further
coonente prosperity.

*.4n contradiction,

4e- Japan ray suffer coneidorable losses in ta Latin Anericah markote 4f
trade relations with Communist Cube continue,

8,

Suggestions:

1.= The benofits derived fron Cuban sugar purchasos are no longer availa-
to Japan, beeauso, due to the drop of prices in tho World Sugar Market, Castro
ot continue to givefirsis privilores that resultcd of high prices, with enough
in to manouver and still recoive benofite.- After prices hitting a post-World
TI low, Castro haa no margin for those oporations, |

: 2.- Japan could very vell substitute its purchases of Cuban sugar by in-
ing its purchases to Taiwan ard Australia, end even better, to Latin szerican
ios like Brazil, tho Téninicen Republic, end Peru, as it used to do previous
concentration of dealings with Castro-Commniem, Purchasing more suger from
cratic Latin Anorican would improve Japan's inago and at the same time it would :
cilalnate dite present trade dangers due to its dealings with Cuba,

"You say recall that, in mid-May this year, the Communist Cuban «=

"On that occasion, we wrote the Greek government calling their at-
tention to the need to save the honor of Greece by severing all ties ~~
diplomatic and commercial-- with the Red government of Cuba. At that =
time, we warned that the gangster Galbe was typical of the new promotion
of Red Cuban "diplomats" --mostly undesirable Communists trained oO Pee
form-tasks of espionage and agitation-- and substantiated our assertion
with a quote from Odon Alvarez de la Campa, a defecting Cuban Giplonate
who had charged Galbe by name during a press conference in Madrid."

"Today, two new defections from the Cuban Foreign Service prompt us
to re-open the Galbe case. We refer to those of Mssrs. Gilberto R. Ale

ULR. REPORTS

SOVIET "FISHING" BASE IN HAVANA

UNIDAD REVOLUCI ONARIA (UR) has learned from its underground sour =
ces in Cuba the following infermation:

The Russians are constructing docks, warehouses, freezers, dry -=
docks, buildings with communication equipment and other necessary ins-
tallations for the operation of a fishing fleet in the east coast of =
the port of. Havana, according to the Cuban-Soviet agreement of Septem-

ber,..1962.

These constructions ‘are directed and supervised by Soviet techni-
cians with the collaboration of Cuban "slave work". The Soviet Union
furnishes all the necessary equipment and machinery, in addition to <=
the above mentioned supervision and technical assistance; Cuba offers
the labor as well as the basic construction materials,

It was stipulated that the Soviet Union and Cuba would share in ~
equal parts this fishing terminal which original cost was $12 million
"pesos" but now it has come UP, bg $30 millions and is expected to be ~
finished by the beginning of 1966.

However, it has.been learned that due to the large sum owed by ~ |
the Castro-Communist tegime to the Soviet Jnion, the Russians have de~
cided that these facilities will be for their exclusive use once they

are concluded,

All the fish caught will be taken to this terminal, processed and
exported to the Soviet Union and Lurope in Russian vessels, without -
any profit for Cuba, nor the Cuban fishing vessels will be allowed to

use Said installations,

This area of the east coast of the pogt of Havana will be closed
as soon as installations are finished and bnly Soviet personnel will-
have access to that zone,

This absolute control of the Soviets in the same port of Havana~
nas led many tothink that said enceriisies will not only serve for ~

operating Soviet trawlers - which activitjes in espionage, infiltratim
c. subversive and terrorist agents are well known = but that it might
hide military constructions, Submarine pens, and other installations ~
that could threaten the sectrity of the Hemisphere.

UNIDAD REVOLUCICHARIA (UR) ha podide conocer a través de sus fuentes clandeg
tinas a Cubs los siguientes infornes!

Ios rusos estén construyendo muelles, diques secos, naves refrigeradas, plan
tas de comunicaciones y derds instalaciones neces:rias para las operaciones
de una flota pesquera en la costa este dél puerto de la Habana, conforme a
lo ectipulado en el acuerdo Soviético-Cubano de Septiembre de 1962.

Estas construccfiones se llevan a cabo bajo la djreccién y oupervisién de téc
nicos soviéticos, con la colaborecién de "trabajo esclavo" cubano, La Unién
Soviética facilita todos los equipos y maquinarias, ademés de la mencionéda

supervisién y asistencia técnicas, y Cuba pone la arena, piedras y materia-
les bésicos de construccién, aparte de la mano de obra.

Se habla estipulado que la Unisn Soviética y Cuba usufructuasen a partes
igueles esta terminal pesouera de vastas properciones, cuyo costo original
era do $12 millones de "pesos", pero que ya asciende a $30 millones y que se

espera estard terminada para principios de 1966.

Sin emtargo, se he podido conocer que debido a le cuantiosa suma que el régi

“en Castro-Comuni ste adeuda a la Unién Soviética, los rusos han determinado

oue estas instalaciones serén para su uso exclusivo una vez terminadas.

Toda la pesca ser llevada a esta terminal, procesada y exportada para la
Unién Soviética y Europa en mercantes rusos, sir aue se derive provecho algu
no para Cuta y sin que los pesqueros cutanos puedan hacer uso de dichas ins=
talaciones.

Esta drea en Ja costa este del puerto de La Habana ser4 cerrada en cuanto se
terminen las instalaciones y sélo el personal soviético tendré acceso a esta

zona.

Este control absoluto soviético en el rropio puerto de La Habana ha hecho
pensar a muchos que dichas instalaciones no sélo servirén para las cperacio~
nes de los "pescueros" rusos ~cuyas actividades de esfionaje, infiltracién
de arentes subvereivos y terroristas son harto conocidas~ sino que pueden es
conder construcciones rilitares, bses para submarinos y otras instalaciones
que amenacen la seguridad del Henisferio.

a simple slip of papor now attached to al) propaganda mailings
roquesting the recipient to send the form back to ANSCROLL's post officq
bex, oy to any other address in the free world for forwarding to
AMSCROLL, a8 a chuck on how much propaganda is getting through, During
tho period AMSCROLL sent out 58,000 envelopes containing 130,000 items,

5, To Latin America primarily, with a scattering of items to
Europe, Asin and’ the United States, ANSCROLL sent out 30,000 items
indluding its tabloid house organ (which is now cut down to 4 pages
from its former 8, and is published only once a month instend of twice),
several booklets reprinted by continued request of correspondents (one
of the largest orders having come from Dominican General Wossin y Weset
shortly before the rebellion) and a map showing training sitos in Cuba
for Latin Amorican guerrillas (samples in Attachment 3).

6, News releases were issued on a numbor of current topics,
AMSCROLL as usual taking the cconomic warfare angle on the news of the
day as it offected Cuba, The 17 relcases of this period wero sont to
newspapers, wire services, magazines, radio and TV stations throughout
the froo world in approximately 350 copies cach, The local public
media mado use of approximately 65% of AMSCROLL's pross reloases,
Although occasional indications are received that AMSCROLL matcrials
are used in other nowspaper and magazine articles, radio programs and
the like, there is no way of making a good ostimato of the amount of
uch replay, Among tho moro important titlos wero tho following

(copies in Attachment 4):

Froe-World Ships Continue Aid to Cuban Economy;
Cuban Budget Includes Proof Economy Crumbling -- an Analysis}
Possible Soviet Curtailmont of Cuban Aid Seen

Greek Firm Bilked in Cuban Trade Nogotiations

» . Japan Secks Expansion of LA Trade While Defying OAS in
Cuban Trafic

24 Sovbloc Undermining Castro Sugar Markets

@s Castro Auctioning Heirlooms Takon from Fleeing Refugees

. 7, Other political action and propaganda moves noted in paragraph
1, above, wore reported separately in detnil, and a full set of

“black list" correspondence was forwardod to Headquarters in UFGA 21616
with a request for any further MIVIPER leads which might contribute to
the further effectiveness of this campaigns

8, AMSCROLL radio programs, 15 minutes daily over both WMIE and
AMTHIGH, carricd much tho same themes as tho AMSCROLL press roleases,
but with adjustments as necossary for tho Cuban audicnce, e.g., while
AMSCROLL pross releases might complain about continued fred-world
trade with and shipping to Cuba, the radio program would emphasize any

decreases in the number of ships.

9, Reactions to AMSCROLL propaganda continue to arrive from Cuba,
put at a slow pace, Tho 24 letters rocoived during the past poriod
contained 7 newspaper clippings and threo pages torn from telephone
books, as requested in ANSCROLL radio programs, Nine of the letters
mentioned the AMTHIGH broadcasts, one noted receipt of the pony~sized
bulletin and two remitted the small acknowledgement forms which accompan|
11 AMSCROLL propaganda mailed into Cuba, Detailed statistics on these
are submitted in a separate report from JMWAVE, |

Many firms have already eeclized what
froding with Communist Cubo means, ond
heve also token into consideration Cubo's
credit’ unworthiness. ONE BILLION
DOLLARS of foreign debr. Therefore,
these firms hove backed sway from this
shernedul ond riskful merket,

Besides, the people of the Countries

storied by the Venezuelan Federation of
dockworkers in occordance with the first

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

REFERENCE: UFGA 19181, dated 21 December 1964

A. OPERATIONAL

1, During December there was considerable pressure on AMSCROLL
to join political groupings being formed by ex-Presidents Urrutia
-and Pric, Fortunately, AMSCROLL was able to stay out of both without
incurring the wrath of either,

B, PRODUCTION

2. Although a number of new propaganda ideas were submitted by
AMSCROLL for approval, the only new item for Cuban consumption ‘
actually printed during the month was the pony bulletin, This and
other items already on hand, including 5,000 Christmas cards, totalled
47,000 pieces which were sent in 20,000 covers to Cuba, Another
10,000 items were distributed to Latin America and Spain, and 13,700
to addressees in the U. S, Most of the two latter categories were
based om requests from religious, social, and civic organizations.
Samples of the items and a breakdown of the actual numbers of each
distributed are in the attached AMSCROLL Propaganda Section report,

3. AMSCROLL broadcasts continued as scheduled, Chief among the
themes, which also pervaded the two issues of the AMSCROLL house organ
published during the month and the above-mentioned pony bulletin for

Cuba, were as follows:

ae The Congo in lurid detail with outrage at the Communist
hand behind the atrocities, and with scorn for the so-called neutralistg
for their attitude for the rescue mission, AMSCROLL editoralized that
except. for the canibalism, Congo tactics including ravage and wanton
murder are what brought Stalin, Tito, Mao, and Fidel to power,

b, AMSCROLL optimistically sees the start of a counter offen-
sive against the rampages of Communism in Latin America, Examples
cited were Castello Branco's action in Goalz Province, Brazil;
Yenezuclan Army operationg in the Andes; Panamanian preparations to
control agitation on the anniversary of the Canal riots; Argentine
Foreign Minister Zavnla's public denunciation of Sovict colonialism
in Cuba; Jagan's defent nt the polls in Guiana; and "operation
Ayacucho," a seven-nntion military mancuver against an “imaginary®
target which has Latin American Communists screaming "foul!"

ce. “Che” Guevara's statemonts before the UN and during his
telovision interview contrasted with quotations from previous speeches,
espocially his current whining for trade openings with the U, S, as
opposed to past claims that U. S, sugar purchases kept Cuba in a state
of colonialism, Much was mado of tho remark of the Nicaraguan dele-
gato to the UN that Guevara's address on behalf of Cuba was a Russian
speoch with an Argentino accent, It was also noted that "Che" admittéd!
Cuba's support of the terrorism in Venezuela. :

d, Cuba's worsoning economic situation way as heretofore, a
constant theme, Featured this month wore tho obvious failures of the
foraging trips of Carlos Rodriguez and "Cho" Guevara, and a host of
specific examples of matorinl shortages admitted by Cuban public media,

e. The Martinez Sanchez suicide and the lack of precise dotailp,
expocially in its aftormath, got considerable attention in AMSCROLL
propaganda, along with other notes on GO strife,

. ff The Sino-Sovict rift was expected to continue, accarding to]
AMSCROLL, and the situation docs not bode well for Castro's relations
with the now Kremlin leaders, Examples taken from press clippings,

& The CIV boycott against free-world ships trading with Cuba
was favorably noted as another facet of the tightening of the noose
around Fidel's neck.

h, End-of-year broadcasts centered on the decline of Communisi
after a half century it still fails to improve the living standards of
the peoples engulfed, but instcad increases terror and oppression to
forge the populations into automatons for use in the realization of
its mad dream of world conquest,

4, Among letters received during the month was a request from
Palo Alto, California for a complete set of AMSCROLL publications for

the Hoover Institute's archives on world revolutions,

5, AMFRAME-2, who is now sccond man in the AMSCROLL Propaganda
Section by dint of his demonstrated imagination and initiative, came
up with a proposal during the month to test reaction to printed
materials being sent to Cuba, Implemented immediately, it consists
of a small coupon which accompanies cach item mailed to 15,000
addressees on a rotating basis each month, The total is divided into
four groups for sample purposes, each group being asked to respond to
requests for general, readily available information on the basis of
different stimuli, cither to have the respondent's code name announced
over the radio or just listed among the "many" others who are contri~
puting to the effort to overthrow the Castro regime, Theoretically,
the assistance would be more fully acknowledged after the liberation,
On the basis of results achieved during the first few months, the
system will be refined until the most successful method for testing

Cuban audience reaction is found, A report will be submitted when
sufficient returns are in, The AMSCROLL Propaganda Section report,

attached, contains further details and a sample of the coupon,

6, We were pleased to receive EGFA 43043 which credited AMSCROLL
propaganda with a minor MHVIPER score on a West German firm which was
doing business with Cuba, Evidently a number of free-world firms are
disturbed in the same way by AMSCROLL's rabre-rattling letters on the
pospjbiljt ab list, A report is being prepared analyzing
