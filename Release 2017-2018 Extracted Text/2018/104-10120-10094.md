MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Control staff .
SUBJECT: Publication Clearance - HUNT, Everette Howard, Jr.

1. Mr.Hunt is Deputy Chief of a Field Station of the Western
Hemisphere Division and he has been operating under a State Department f
covers 1

2. Mr. Hunt has been granted security clearances for several
novels during his employment with this Agency, In 1949, just prior
to employment with CIA, he published Day of the Serpent, a fictional
work on OSS in China, He has achieved considerable national prom
inence as an author of World War II stories,

3. His full nam is Everette Howard Hunt, Jr. The manuscript
just submitted carries the name Howard Hunt on the title page, His
PHS includes the nickname “Howie" with the explanation that this is
his nom de plume, On the last page of his PHS he stated that an
estimated one million pocket edition copies of two of his books are
in circulation, His present publisher, Fawcett Publications, Inc.,
New York, publishes the 25 and 35 cent books which are sold in
drugstores, newstands, hotels, st@tions, etc., throughout the United
States, It seems quite probable that Mr. Hunt woujd be know as a
writer by persons in the Latin American country where he is now
stationed and that his work will be read by some Latin Americans even
though it is in English, It is not mow whether or not the pocket y
book publishing companies have exported their publications in
Spanish editions to Latin America,

4, Darkness on the Land is the title of ‘the novel for which
security Clearance ~is now requested, There appear to be several
objectionable aspects in the novel when it~is considered in com
bination with the fact. that the author is ostensibly a State Department:
employee stationed in Latin America,

"5. For instance, the theme of the book seems to be that the
mythical country which is the locale of the story is representative gee

of Latin America, It is the impression of the undersigned, as a
reader, that the author speaking through his characters regards the
Latin Americans as ignorant, corrupt, homicidal savages, Some
passages which tend to support this inference appear below.

p. 16 f and also p, 125 £, The American Consul - “Any
particular reason for a revolution now? xxx Does there have to |
be a particular reason in South America? sox" \

p. 41 f, Sr, Pedro Icaza - "xxx In terms of your North
American armies, Latin armies are laughable, xxx That is the
rule in this part of the world, xxx An army has no patriotic
loyalty that holds it to the side of the government, x08

p. 58 f, Sr. Beltran - "Los Indios xox they provide a
stolid background before which the five percent struggles i
and fails or wins, xxx We have mestizos xox the mixed blood }
gives an unbelievable shrewdness, 4 barbaric ruthlessness t :
its possessors.* .

It would seem that the author's fixation in regard to the superiority
of the Nordic to the Latin and Indian races, which permeates the
entire novel, would be most offensive to Latin Americans. The Latin
Americans might well argue that Mr, Hunt, like Erskine Caldwell,

has taken a sample of the illiterate, amoral minority in Latin
America and used it to depict a whole culture,

6. Ina soliloquy on p. 19, Mr. Hunt's North American hero,
Selden, describes Latin American miles as though they are suffering
from a racial or southern continental satyriasis. His play upon
the expressions “mchos huevos" and "cajones* conveys the impression
that the author suffers from a fixation that the Latin American
males as a whole are a race of bravos, The description of this .
characteristic, which he appears to attribute to them, is belabored i
through the mouth of Fedder, a Nazi refugee on p. 100, "It is the H
curse of this continent, Always the men mist wear pistols. They
must wear spurs and carry small whips around their wrists and have
half-a dg¥%en mistresses of whom they boast.so that no man can
question their machismo xo® Again, on p. 163 f, Carlitos, who is
a character of Sufficient importance to be intended as a local *type*",
is made to say, "In this country of mine complete vengeance is held
to be the killing of an enemy and the savage rape of his wife or :
daughter. When one has achieved such vengeance, one realizes that
life can offer no greater triumph. It is then that death becomes
unimportant 2x, It is the nature of our blood. This sort of
writing might be said by Latin Americans to indicate that the author! s
thinking is rooted in the discredited theories of Racism, If, as

if comes to the attention of Latin Americans,will have an equivalent
effect to a Commmist novel depicting America as a gangster. culture. f

7. The women of Latin America are not ignored, Aside fr
brutal passages of stark, sexual realism and sadism involving @
prostitate (p. 148, 155) and a pimpoint study of the confused, .semt-
superstitious religious attitude of the pregnant mistress of the. - .
President who betrays him-(p. 297) - the description of the lati
incident might offend persons of thé dominant religion in South
America - Mr. Hunt has Seldon, his North American hepp, observe on:
p. 18), "Find a woman who will ‘not allow you to~sleep xxx From what
I have seen of your women, there should be many such.® - : F

8. Mr. Hunt also indulges through his characters in some |
sophisticated, political philosophizing, which if attributed ‘to a
State Department or CIA employee might be argued to be a deterministic
philosophy of Defeatism, The following passages seem to support ‘this-
tmference; : : >

Pe 18, the American Consul - "I'm not trying to sell the ©
thing we call Democracy dow here, I tried it for 6 months ~
five years ago - and haven't bothered since, They thought.I
was crazy.® . . oe

p. 82, Seldon, the American hero, - "xxxthe world has been
deceived by propagandists into believing that peace is mankind's
goal, when the contrary has been displayed in the nature of -—— -
man 2co® 7

Pe 84-86, Selden comments cynically on the change of
propaganda once the Germans and Japanese were defeated; and on
our need to put our ow house in order before exporting
"international wisdom or devotion to principles,”

9. At present, there is a committee of. Congress investigating
pocket book publications sold on newstands and in drugstores which
include pgrnographic or sadistic passages. Congressional objection
is not to this school of literature but to“the fact that Fawcett
Publishing Company and others profit from its sale to adolescents .
in 25 cent editios, Artistically, Mr. Hunt might be said to be a
stark realist. Some passages which might be criticized as salacious
or vulgar are indicated below;
