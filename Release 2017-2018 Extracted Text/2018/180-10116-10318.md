Dear Mr. Blakey:

Reference is made to your letter of March 24, 1978, requesting access to

two documents either at this Service or the Central Intelligence Agency

relating to Eduardo Julius Whitehouse, All 241 940.

The first item was a name check made by this Service on June 23, 1963.

This appears to be a request from our Private Bill Unit based on Private

Bill H.R. 7057 introduced in the 88th Congress to restore his citizenship.

When this bill failed to be enacted and was not reintroduced in the 89th

Congress, the work folder was destroyed.

We are unable to locate any reference made to subject dated April 7,

1967. When subject was naturalized in the United States District Court

at Miami on November 19, 1965, he was no longer an alien and does not

come within the jurisdiction of this Service.

Today I spoke with Mr. Marvin 3176-8369)

the Congressional Liaison for the Department of Immigration

and Naturalization in an effort to obtain the dates on

which Santos Trafficante and Judith Campbell Exner re-

entered the United States in the period of 1959-1960.

Mr. Ely told me that if these persons were citizens,

no record would have been kept. If they are aliens,

the Immigration and Naturalization Act would have required

that reentry records be maintained. If such information

were kept, he stated that we would need a letter from the

Chairman to obtain that information. He further stated

that he would feed the information I gave him into their

'computer and would inform us on Monday, September 12,

whether the computer contained the reentry information.

I responded that if such information were contained, we

would supply him with a letter from the Chairman.

Dear Mr. Blakey:

On behalf of the Select Committee on Assassinations, the National

Archives and Records Service has approached the Social Security

Administration, the United States Secret Service, and the Internal

Revenue Service regarding access by the Committee to documents

originated by those agencies.

The Secret Service has advised us that they have no objection to the

release of the documents in question, but that since the information

contained in the documents originated in the Federal Bureau of Inves-

tigation, release to the Committee must be governed by the Committee

agreement with the FBI.

The Social Security Administration has agreed to access to those

portions of the records that were not generated by the Internal Revenue

Service, and the latter portions must be governed by the IRS.

A copy of the letter from the Internal Revenue Service is enclosed.

Sincerely,

items to be used in the preliminary analysis phase of our

5)

scale drawing of Dealey Plaza

small scale drawing of Dealey Plaza

four pictures of Dealey Plaza

2 pictures of the Texas School Book Depository

2 shots of the underpass leading towards

The large scale drawing of Dealey Plaza should be

useful in that the numbers on Houston Street (ex: 240,

235, etc.) are markings that correspond to Zapruder film

markings. Also, the angles from the window to the ground

correspond with the Zapruder film.

Please be aware, however,

that the markings are based on the FBI's measurements and

the Committee cannot vouch for their accuracy.

We are in

the process of compiling our own data independently and will

forward that material when it is ready.

As John and I promised you during our last visit,

the Zapruder film frames corresponding to the shots will

be delivered as soon as we receive them.

Sincerely,

May I ackoon

to get the items to Suzanne Cavanaugh before the end of this

working day.

If additional Library of Congress personnel will be work-

ing on this project, they should report to Room 200B at the

National Archives to get a researchers card, prior to reporting

to Room 6E3 where the research project will

be conducted.

It would be appreciated if you would have your personnel

contact Margo Jackson on the afternoon prior to the day you are

planning to go to the Archives to work.

This is necessary so

that proper arrangements can be made with Archives personnel.

We are having the Russian-language materials, which did

not become Commission Exhibits, viewed to determine if they

fall into the categories which were discussed by Ms. Jackson

and Ms. Cavanaugh.

II so, they will be given to you for

analysis by the Russian division of the Library, pursuant to

the same guidelines as the above items.

In reference to the analysis of the periodicals, we would

like you to analyze The Worker and The Militant for the period

April 1963 - November 1963. Please focus on the following:

a. Cuba

b. Russia

c. Kennedy Administration policy toward Cuba

d. political

associations

e. American leaders' policy toward Communism,

subversive groups, Cuba and the Soviet Union.

HAND DELIVERED

The Honorable Gilbert Gude

Director of Congressional Research

Service

Room 107

Washington, D. C. 20540

Dear Mr. Gude:

Pursuant to our meeting this morning, which was

attended by Stephen Langone and Suzanne Cavanaugh of CRS,

and Margo Jackson and

Richard Billings of the Select Commit-

• tee on Assassinations' staff, certain stipulations were

agreed upon pertaining to our reading project on Lee. Harvey

Oswald.

On Wednesday, May 24, 1978, at 10:00 A.M. Suzanne

Cavanaugh and Margo Jackson will meet at the National Ar-

chives to examine a group of materials believed to have been

read by Lee Harvey Oswald.

After the selection of the appropriate materials,

the CRS project will consist of the following:

1. CRS will prepare an outline consisting of:

a. A paragraph summary of each item; and

b. A discussion as to how CRS could analyze

the items as they relate to motive.

2. CRS will prepare a paper consisting of:

a. A description of the types of literature

Lee Harvey Oswald was exposed to; and

b. A discussion of how these materials may have

provided a possible motive for the assassina-

tion of President Kennedy.

•-Thê Honorable Gilbert Gude

May 22, 1978

Page Iwo

A due date for this paper will be discussed on

May 29th.

We realize that the researcher may have difficulty

making firm determinations as to a probable motive, but we

are confining our expectations to possibilities and prob-

abilities.

In coming to such determinations, the researcher

should consider the following

areas which

may appear in the

literature:

1. Political assassinations.

2. Speeches and statements by Castro.

3. American policy toward Cuba.

4: John F. Kennedy's policy toward Cuba.

5. American leaders' policy toward Communism, sub-

versive groups, Cuba and the Soviet Union.

6. Anything indicating a possible motive for as-

sassination.

As was discussed this morning, it might be helpful if

the assigned researcher reads the following sections of the

Warren Commission Report to get a clearer understanding of

the issues we are pursuing:

pages 254-333, 375-424, and 669-740.

As your study progresses, please feel free to con-

tact the Committee.

Burke Marshall, Esquire

Poverty Hollow

Road

Newtown, Connecticut 06470

Dear Mr. Marshall:

In connection with the

e investigation of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations into the death of President

John F. Kennedy, I am writing to request your authorization to

have the Committee perform sophisticated photographic enhance-

ment and analysis work on relevant frames of the Kennedy

autopsy pictures.

The enhancement and analysis work involved

is critical to the research efforts of the Committee's autopsy

and ballistics experts.

This

determination was made after a

meeting between the Committee's photography panel and Dr.

Michael Baden, a

member of our autopsy panel.

The Committee's present desire is to obtain those

original transparencies and pictures that depict the following

areas of concern: 1) the President's head; 2) the President's

back;: and 3) the President's neck.

At this time, we expect

that our work will be limited to frames 26, 28,

33-34, 38-41,

and 44-48 of the photographic autopsy materials contained in

the National Archives, but it is possible that some other

frames depicting the areas stated above will also become the

subject of analysis and enhancement work.

The Committee's intention is to deliver these items,

under the supervision of personnel from the National Archives,

to the Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of

Southern California Image Processing Laboratory, and the

Aerospace Corporation of California.

National

Archives personnel will remain in constant visual contact with

these materials. Each of the organizations performing this

work has assured me that none of the scientific techniques they

will be utilizing pose any risk of damage to the materials in-

volved. Moreover, because of the sensitivity of these mater-

ials, the experts

performing this work have been instructed

(and have promised) that at no time are any of the frames

H 55923 DocId:32266673 Page 129

involved to be reproduced in their entirety.

Instead, in each

instance, only the particular area of interest within

each

photograph will be reproduced. This precaution is designed

to avoid the possibility of any unauthorized individual ex-

amining a particular frame and recognizing the President. The

Committee has also been assured that all of the materials

generated by these experts, including intermediate and

"waste"

products, will be returned

to the Committee for proper dispo-

sition. All of these materials will go directly from the

laboratories involved to National Archives personnel, so that

at no time will anyone have possession of any autopsy-related

photographic materials in the absence of proper supervision

by the National Archives.

No action will be taken regarding

any of the materials generated by the Committee's analysis

and enhancement work without your prior consent.

As the Committee would like to make these materials

available on Tuesday, February 28, 1978, to our experts at the

Rochester Institute of Technology, we would appreciate a prompt

response to this request.

DI. Trudy Peterson

of the National

Archives has informed me that

she will be available on Monday,

February 27, 1978, to discuss

this issue with you. Her tele-

phone number is 202-523-3132.

Finally, I must apologize for failing to contact you

earlier concerning this matter; I hope that you are not in-

convenienced by the short notice with which this request is

being made. In the event that you have any questions concern-

ing this matter, please do not hesitate to call either Mi.

Michael Goldsmith, the Senior Staff Counsel directing

this

project, or me, at our homes this weekend. My home telephone

number is 703-281-1729.

named Al Jolson. I told her to call back Monday or

sometime this week to discuss this matter with Donovan Gay.

She was

rembeling on and was

mostly coherent and I did

not know how much information to take down. I also did

not give her my name... I talked to Donovan Gay immediately

after the phone call at his home. Gave him all the

details on the phone and gave him the Balitmore address

and told him if he would like I would go by on the way

home and check out to see if it was a boarding house

or whatever?. After following up on the address it turned

out to be a business address of a fur company. Located

at Park Avenue and Saratoga Street in Balitmore.

Dear Mr. Foreman:

I have your letter of May 28, and

I have read the enclosure to it and under-

stand the motives which led you to write

me. While the Chief Justice will undoubtedly

respond to your letter, I would add that the

members of the Commission have given this

matter very detailed consideration. I can

further assure you that the members of the

Commission themselves will evaluate the

evidence and assume full responsibility of

the writing of the report.

Faithfully yours,

Allen W. Dulles

Dear. Jim:

The Commission was discharged by the Presi-

dent upon presentation of its report and delivery of

its files to the National Archives.

There is no

longer any Commission or staff to act concerning your

suggestion in your memorandum of November 8, 1966.

In

my opinion, the former Commissioners and the former

staff of the Commission have no more legal standing

to ask that they be allowed to examine the photographs

and X-ray pictures made in connection with the autopsy

of President Kennedy than any other citizens.

Thus, if you or any other citizen desires to

examine such materials and can persuade the proper

authorities to allow you to do it, that is your right.

For myself, I am satisfied with the testimony of the

doctors who performed the autopsy and whose statements,

in my opinion, were the best evidence of what was seen

and heard at the autopsy.

In the final analysis: I think

our report must stand or fall on the basis of what it con-

tains.

Sincerely,

i Rue Bankin

Dear Art:

I have Just received this morning a tele-

phone call from Jerome Kidder in Frank Hogan's

office who told me he had received a request

from Garrison in New Orleans with regard to a

service on me to appear there. When I told

him I was a resident of the District of Columbia

and not of New York, he said he would return the

papers to Garrison with an indication that the

matter was not in his jurisdiction. I told

Kidder that I had consulted you and that if he

wished further information, he might wish to

call you. He may or may not do so, possibly

will not, as he felt that the information with

regard to my being a resident in the District

of Columbia would cover the matter as far as

he was

concerned.

As ever,

mittee set up to monitor access to those yapers. The third

cormiütee should oppose access by the stafi of the Select Co.:-

mittee and I have so inforned is. wolf, the cider of its legal

stair. In return ir. wolf agreed to keep me informed as to uno

would do the review of the papers and, of nore importance to

us, wiar they night wont to copy for connittee records. It is

my belief that thore is very liütle in the papers you have

that vill be truly pertinent to their investigation.
