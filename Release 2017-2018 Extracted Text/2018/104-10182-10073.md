Handwriting Assessment Report a

: : : “Alastair Wicks AF

The ‘writer seems to be a very clever individual of a high
intellectual’ level” who handles.his ‘affairs. in a independent
vmannér, | Endowed “with .a good intelligence, he is well educated
vandvcultured, ‘He has not ‘only absorbed but, -also;~‘assimi- ated,
he material he has: réad-and studiéd and utilizes*it-in a pur-
-“poséful fashion.’ His thinking'is clear, logical and.versatile.

ce s 3 ‘Re’ discards’ superfluous matters, and,
: possible,'hé deals'witt only the vital points ina

yzing and synthesizing faculties. He
enses- instinctively the implications of

is quite intuitive an
happenings around him.

He is an alert and astute observer. of. small ‘détails vhich
hé relates correctly to their larger aspects, Being quite re-
sourceful, he combines imagination with sober matter-of-factness.
He follows prescribed rules and regulations when absolutely
necessary ard, whenever possible, exercises his mental indepen-
dence. .He forms his own opinion and judgment and. keeps his own
counsel in making decisions. “He, may accept somebody else's
suggestions that he considers suitable for-his purposes but he
isnot actually influenced by others, At times, he may deliber-

: “ately make somebody feel as if he is seeking his advice and
Benes following it, but, in reality, he does what he considers best,
He is very critical and-evaluates by high standaids, He can be
iateeece very outspoken in his criti¢ism or he can cautiously withhold it
depending on his..appraisal of the circumstances, His interests
cover small items of information to large size projects and
operations. While he notices everything that is going on, he
can concentrate on his work.’ When required, he can switch quickly
from one task.to another, His memory. functions well and he can
reproduce facts easily,

He’ possesses: impressive mental- agility - op certo



7 eee The writer.has administrative ability: on a supervisory level.
: Within a military setup,.he could. take orders as well as ‘issue

7 them, although Ke prefers the latter. - He can be systematic and

i “0 methodical in’ his’ approach. .He can work out 'a blueprint .of an

: é : 5 dntvicate undertaking and’‘Supervise its proper. execution. He will

quickly and easily adapt to fluctuations ina situation and change

his tactics accordingly, 7 Beeveaiatt ‘ a :

ut ofa finaticial transaction.” - ieee real

< facility, in expressing himself orally
ean:make-his' points: palatable ard can ‘be quite
“in‘his arguments.’ Also; he can formulate his idéas
es in different ways; di ding.on with. whom he fs |
a He ‘should havée"talert for ‘learning foreign: languages,
He is’ a gifted person who: will exploit-his talents in-line with
the demands that are put -beforée him. Hé-4180 seems to have
physical training and skills. He has a natural feeling for
form, sound and color, He. probably has developed artistic
appreciation and may have an artistic hobby, possibly miusic.

Emotionally, th? writer is complex but fairly well balanced,
Innately impressionable and’ sensitive, he has hardened himself
—in-the-course of his life in‘ order to be less vulnerable, He
has his feelings and impulsés under fairly good control and avoids
‘being carried away by them, In his private life, though, he may
tend to be somewhat éxcitable and-irritable. He is self-centered
and most interested in his personal advantage. This is a trait
that he tries. to cover up by beifig smooth and pleasing in-his
dealings with people. -He possesses natural psychological under-
standing-and can be very. diplomatic. He manages to appear out-
going and social while basically .he is quite reserved and: detached,
He seems to avoid emotional involvements in order to preserve his
objectivity, ieeeeieesitanet



ss

Wis appearance ‘is poiséa and gophisticated, and he knows
how to handle. himself under different conditions, Being an
independent and sophisticated’ individual, he has developed his
own philosophy ahd code'of ethics by which he lives, . He does
tot ;seem' to have -any, qualiis ‘about: doing things: that would not
be conventionally acteptable, vcHe. is very. broad-minded about
himself and othérs, -and he detests: pettyness, even in iwrong-
doing. The: purpose’ justifies the means for him as long ag.the
transaction takes: place-on a ‘Varge “seale. Hée-is “Ost skiliful -

*He is emotionally

apparently an unusually ‘talented person’ who
could function’ in different: typés.of positions: - He could be a

esmib y officer; a éss ‘executive, a politician, an intelli-
gerice ‘agent ‘or-he. could be a-diplomat. "He would -not ‘be suitable
for any kind of routine work;. bit he is well qualified for
mentally ‘challenging ass ignments--the more challenging the better,
‘He is.a diligent: worker whois’ somewhat vain in showing off his
competence, He likes to demonstrate how successfully he can
carry out.a complicated and delicate job. When he is willing
to accept.an assignment, one.can expect a high quality. of work
performance’, but anybody who would expect loyalty from him would
probably be disappointed,
