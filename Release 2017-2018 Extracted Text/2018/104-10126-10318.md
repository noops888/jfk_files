SUMMARY OF MR. HART'S PRESENTATION

I. Defection as a Psychological Phenomenon

Misinterpretation of Nosenko's reactions will
be covered within the context of failure to under-
stand the stresses to which he was subjected as a
defector.

II. 1962 Contacts

Factors leading to an inaccurate record during
the 1962 meetings will be covered.

III. The Role of Mr. X
The influence of another defector -- to be
referred to only as Mr. X -- will be indicated as
resulting in misinterpretation of many of Nosenko's
statements.

IV. Confinement of Nosenko

Details of the confinement will be outlined as
they relate to possible misinterpretation of his
statements under questioning during the period up to
his being reassigned to the custody of the CIA Office
of Security.

The entire presentation will be about 30 pages in
length when reduced to final written form. Mr. Hart's
presentation will not specifically address the question
of Nosenko's statements regarding Lee Harvey Oswald.
Mr. Hart, in studying the Nosenko case, deliberately
disregarded the Oswald aspect of the case inasmuch

as it had by and large been handled by the FBI.

Mr. Hart will argue that, inasmuch as Nosenko is a
bona fide defector, his statements regarding Lee Harvey
Oswald should be accepted as having been given in

good faith and to the best of his knowledge.
