visited the(Warrenton |Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search*0f additional photographs of the
“unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such

that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to.
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
