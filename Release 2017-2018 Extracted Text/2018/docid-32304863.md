PL 137-4887

Pu 872-PC has coupleted three years of college

and served time in the U. S. Navy during World War II.

STEVEN JOSEPH LA TORRE, born 3/11/86, Montedoro,

Sicily, immigrated to the United States in 1903, and has

always resided in the Pittston, Pa+s area.

After arriving in the United States, LA TORRE

sent money to SANTO VOLPL, SR., (Deceased) Philadelphia

File 92-752, Bureau File 92-8318, to pay for VOLPE's

passago to the United States.

VOLPE came to the United

States and becane the leader of the Mafia in the Pittston,

Pa•s area.

LA TORRE, who has admitted membership in the

Mafia to PH 872-PC, was a close associate of VOLPE in a

coal contracting business for several years. LA TORRE was

also a business associate of CHARLES C. BUFALINO (Deceased),

Philadelphia File 92-1590, Bureau File 92-8630, who also

held a leadership role in

the Organization.

Both VOLPE and

BUFALINO were friends of LA TORRE in Montedoro, Sicily.

It is to be noted that CHARLES C. BUFALINO is the

unele of RUSSELL A. BUFALINO, Philadelphia File 92-443,

Bureau File 92-2839, who attended the meeting of hoodluns

at Apalachin, N. Y..

in November, 1957, and is the current

Leader of the LCN in the upstate

Pennsylvania area.

LA TORRE was an influential figure in the

Organization fron the time he cane to Pittston, Pa., and up to

approximately 1945. Sometime around 1945 111 feeling developed

between LA TORRE and the Organization, and as a result he

was looked upon with disfavor and not recognized by the

leaders, including deceased JOHN SCIANDRA, father of ANGELO

SCIANDRA, who also attended the Apalachin meeting.

PH 372-PC has stated it is anazing that his father

was never killed by the Organization, but feels he has

been allowed to live because he has always been respected

and feared.

PH 872-PC has advised that in addition to admitting

menbership in the Mafia, his father, STEVEN JOSEPH LA TORRE,

-2-

PH 137-4887

has confided in him and identified other members of the

Organization. LA TORRE has also related to PH 872-PC

past activities of the Organization, which has included

information concerning the Organization's involvement

in past murders.

PH 872-PC claims he is the favorite son of STEVEN

JOSEPH LA TORRE. He has stated that his father has

enlightened hin on the Organization's membership and

activities for his own personal protection. PH 872-PC

has to date denied LCN memberships however,

the contacting

Agent is not completely convinced that PH 872-PC is a

non-nenber.

PH 872-PC has stated that his father has never

refused to answer questions concerning the Organization,

and he, PH 872-PC, is willing to present him with any

question that he cannot answer.

The first few contacts with PH 872-PC were related

to information he furnished in connection with a matter

entitled, "SAMUEL RUGGERE, ETAL; TFIS,* Philadelphia File

100, bureau File 15-57882, in which Philadelphia is

the office of origin.

PH: 872-PC furnished reliable and

valuable infornation in this matter, and was responsible

for the recovery of stolen property valued at approximately

$44,000.

0л. 5/8-9/67, PH 872-PC identified 38 individuals

as nembers of the Organization or the Mafia.

He has stated

these identities are based upon information he has received

fron his father.

It is to be noted that 30 of these individuals have

been previously identified as LCN members.

PH 872-PC has

also identified JOSEPH LUCO PAGANO and PASQUALE PAGANO

as members of the Organization. It is to be noted that both

of these individuals are subjects of LCN Index Cards of

the New York Office.

Based upon the information set torch above

the Philadelphia Offion believes that PH 872-PC is in a

position to positively identify LN members.

It is realized

## Page 6

P0: 137-4887

that PH 872-PC does not fully meet the criteria set up by the

Bureau; le, a menber can be only identified through a

highly confidential source or an admitted member.

Philadelphia feels,however, that PH 872-PC is an exception

to the rule, and Bureau authority is requested to consider

PH 872-PC an authority in identifying LCN members.
