by OSS in an assignment as a newspaperman (printing chief in a Central
Pacific operation). This approval was withdrawn on 23 December 1944,
however, becanse of non-concurrence by OG/AAF. He was then assigned
to combat infantry duty in the Southwest Pacific; he was not used by OSS.
In February 1945 he visited the’ Honolulu Office of OSS and claimed that



“at Baylor Hospital, Dallas.

he had been recruited by OSS while he was attending infantry school

at Fort Benning in October 1944, He stated that his services were to
have been used to originate and conduct radio, programs in the CBI
theater, that:he had been investigated by Dunn and Bradstreet, ‘and that
in the course ‘of a long distance teluphone’call to the OSS Personnel
Procurement Office he had:been told that-OSS could not ‘use him at that
time but that he'should-keep in ‘touch, The interviewirg officer in

in his hospital room, to which he had:been returned from the operating
room, WOOD said that.he had served overseas with the CLA and had


seen many people killed, "The CLAlare a bunch of dirty cut-throats,
and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they sent one of their men to cut
mine, . They think they are-smart, but one of these days in the near
future [ wili show them who is the smartest, They have about 100
GS-14's walking around with their heads shaped like eggs. . .'. Ehave
been a failure but after I get well I am going to go back to school and
get my degree and fight the CIA with everything that Ican,"

C. Current Developments

informed the Office of Security that at 1600 hours on 27 December he
had_received a telephone call [rom Subject, who had becn his subordinate
in| CI/R&A called Dr. Aldrich, who supplied the following

additional information:



epIET : i

a. WOOD said that he was calling froma pay
Phone in a Sears Roebuck store in Dallas. He provided
a home telephone number, which we have not acen_able *
to verify, and he believes that this telephone is bugged.

b. WOOD had found the telephone number of
Dr. Aldrich in the directory, His only previous call was
made in 1966, when he requested a recommendation for
@ newspaper job for which he was applying: Dr. -Aldrich
referred him to Personnel.

: ¢. Subject told Dr. Aldrich on 27, December that _
he had information which he urgently wanted to communicate
to'CIA. He sounded upset. :

14, C/CI/R&A advised Dr.. Aldrich that if Subject telephoned
again, he should be told that his call had:been referred to the proper.
authorities. Because of the information reported above, ‘there was
a. possibility of provocation.

15. In the mid-afternoon of 28 December 1968 Subject again
telephoned Dr, Aldrich from an.unknown location. He asked whether
Someone would be in touch with him, Dr.’ Aldrich said that Subject's
information had been relayed to those responsible and that hé had no
information about future contact. Subject said that he was not trying
to involve Dr. Aldrich but that he did have information‘to relay. He
sounded less frightened than on his previous call. He suggested that
whoever called or visited him should imself by referring to
information held in common (i.é., Ps Ea 1951-1952), Out of a
job, WOOD had received two or three oiters of employment but was not
Sure of the identities of the prospective employers and feared
Provocation, presumably from Garrison's office. Apparently he believes
that the FBI is monitoring his home telephone.

16. [tis our intent so ask the Bureau to relay this information
to its office in Dallas and‘to instruct an FBI representative to call
upon Subject and request elucidation, because such information



SECaer

as Subject may have, if any, is within the Bureau's jurisdiction

i rather than that of this Agency.
