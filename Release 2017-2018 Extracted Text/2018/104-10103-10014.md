8. Fingnees, The undersigned was prepared. to
give AM TP/1 suigicient funds to cover his expenses and
those of AMLASH during the recent three-week gojourn in
Europe which A/l made at our ‘request. However, A/1 refused
to accept any renunsration whatsoever’, stating that. the
money we had given kin for hig round-trip ticket (¢950,00).
was enough, This, for the record, represents an outlay
conservatively of some $1200 to $1500 by 4/1 frou his own
pocket on KUBARK behalf, not to mention the lost time from
his own business. We believe this. gesture should be
remembered in future dealings: with A/1.

4. General. A/l wes feeling poorly as the result
of a flu-type. cold when we met. He stated that he wold not.
have cone in at all were it not for ovr scheculed meeting.
Nevertheless, he spent willingly several hours with us,
going over the points in which we were interested. The
meeting terminated at 1530 with no incidents of a security
nature noted.

was three years old and hence not very accurate. We did not

press the question, nor suggest mames, as it waa evident

that he felt that his answers would simply not.give a true,

and in particular, guestioned A/l about AMLASH's frame of
mind: and future plang which he may have revealed to A/1L
aitéer Ontrich departed the scene. A/1 wade several points, .
which basically boiled down to the fact that AMLASH was E
still not pleased with the support he was getting from the
USG@ side. The visit with DAINOLD, ‘who acted in the capacity
of a:representative of high levels of the Govt concerned
with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMLASH as far as policyy
was concerned , but he was not af all happy with the fact
that he still was not given the technical assistance for.
the operational plan as he gaw it. A/1l said that AMLASH
dwelt coustantiy on this point. He could not understand
why he was denied certain small pieces of. equipment which
prottiised a final solution to the problema, while, on the
other hand, the USG gave much equipment and woney to exile
groups for their ineffective excursions against: Cuban
coastal targets, According to A/1, AMLASH feols. strongly:
on this: point, and if he does not gat advice and materials

4/1 stated that ANLASIF now has his: feet wet.vis-a-vis:
coonerating with USG and has accepted the fact that he will”
. work profitably. and securely with it. It is this that. we
stand to lose with our procrastination. ° AMLASH ‘also
talked about going to the French terrorist group, the OAS;
: invorder to get. the uaterials and guidance he needs.’ It”
ia belioved that he was talked out of this idea, after the
dangers. involved were discussed with AMLASH.

@, With revard to the radio gear, AMLASH stated
that he did not fecl that he wanted to take one in with’
hin, particularly in view of the recent.arrests: in: Cuba
of agents carrying concealed radios. He was not opposed,
however, at. this time to havingsza radio cached for -him,.
to. be recovered by hiu later.

8. According to AMMIP, if there is any interest
in having. AMLASH link up with other trusted assets in
Cuba, these ‘names ‘would have to be given to him-before he
Vreturned; otherwise he would not trust any other means
used later inside ne get him to initiate or hishesaiai to such ©
contacts. = 7 —_

aid from, or at least discussing his: position, with .
‘Manolo RAY. Towever, he stated that he questioned whether: :
this was the best idea, since. if RAY came to Paris while
he (LASH) was there, people would. conclude that there was
something between the two, Another spot would.be better,

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMLASIT
_ said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris
staffer) “upon his return’ to Paris. (This he subsequently
did on the 15th of November, anieaint to info cihatpbhaa
“from Paris-sonewhat belatedly).

11. °. When AMLASI, A/1, and VENEGAS. were together
in Rome-and Italy, VENEGAS told ANLASH that people were
betting that LASH would not réturn to Cuba... Some had also
questioned his wother on this point. AMLASH reportedly
told VENEGAS to cover all the bets he could as he would
be a rich man. . {It tas at this time, according to A/1,
that AHLASH decided that he had potter return to Havana

alittle sooner than he intciled, in fact almost. as secon
as possible.)

2 ry AMLASTL talked about the “tyro possibilities

of re-taking Cuba - either thru invasion by US troops, or
>is way. He also realized, however, that invasion was
not to be eunsid

ved seriously at this tine. Also, AMLASH
talked ahbowt his ability toe take some men into the hills

. Of-Las Villas: Province and taking the smali towns of

Trinidad sud Topes de Collaates. He said that he and hig:
nen could inst no more than 15 days im the hilla as the
anti-guorrilla fighters sow employed by the Regime were
ives { knew the way to fight, and
ain the hills. ‘Also the Soviet 6quipuent made the govt
forces much nore formidable than in Batista's time. AMLASH
apparently was discussing these ideag with the impression
that this waa the way to set up a provisional rebel govt
and thereby invite and gain US support, By the way A/1
talked, it.is fairly certain that AMLASH realized that
this was not the kind of a pian which could even renotely

‘be expected to receive USG@ aid. Jt is hoped that he

does realize that Ji@vene must first-be taken... or failing
that, a treely sizable niece of land (say, almost an ¢

“entire province): which could be-a true rallying point and

staging ground under complete Rebel control, from which

“the rest of the island could be wrested from the Fidelistas

and the Connunists.

: 13. In summary, the talks with A/1l led the
undersigned to believe that AMLASH is again entering

one of his skeptical moods, one which our actions ‘have
done littie to dispel. Too little and too late.......
