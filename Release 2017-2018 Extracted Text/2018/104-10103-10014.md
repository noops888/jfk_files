then questioned about the identities of follovers

of Major DEnIMS, A/l stated that it would be better to

refer

to slash, as he (A/l) could only give information that

was three years

old and hence not vory accurate. We did

press the question, nor suggect names, as 1t was evident

n0t

that he felt that his answers rould aluply not give a true,

current pleture.

A/1 provided

the full naue of a possible lead

In addition to the above information, the

undersigned discussed various aspects of the AllAS case,

and in particular, guestioned A/1 about A-LASH's frame of

mind and future plans which he may have revealed to A/l

after entrich departed the scene.

A/l made several points,

which basically boiled down to the fact that AMASH mag

still not pleased with the support he was getting fron the

USd side.

The vistt with DAINOLD, who acted in the capacity

of a representative of high levels of the Govt concernod

with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMASH as far as policyy

was concerned, but he was not at all happy with the fact

that he still was not given the technical assistance for

the operational plan as he saw it. A/1 said that AMLASH

dwelt constantly on this point.

He could not understand

why he was denied certain snall pieces of equipsent which

promised a final solution to the problem, while, on the

other hand, the USG gave much equipment and money to exile

groups for

their ineffective excursions against Cuban

coastal

targets,

According to A/1, AlASil feels strongly:

on this point, and if he does not get advice and materials

from USG technician, he will probably bocome fed-up agolz,

and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date.

A/1 stated that ALASI! now has his leet wet visa-vis:

cooperating with USG and has accepted the fact that he mill

work profitably and accurely with it. It is this that we

stand to lose with our procrastination.

AMLASH a150

talked about going

to the French terrorist group, the dAS,

in order to get the naderials and guidance he noeds.

It"

1o belloved that he was talked out of this idea, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASI.

T, With rocord to the radio gear, AMASH stated

that he did

not feel that he wanted to take one in with

hin, particularly. In view of the recent arrests in Cuba

of agents carrying concealed radios. He was not opposed,

however, at this tive to havingsa radio cached for him,

to be recovered by hia later.

8.

According to AMLIP, 11 there 1s any interest

in having ALASI link up with other trusted assets in

Cuba, these names would have to be given to him before he

returned; otherwise he rould not trust any other meang

need

later inside to get him to intiate or respond to such

contacts.

A/l stated that AMLASH talked about getting

this was the best idea, since if lAY came to paris while

he (LASH) was there, people would conclude that there was

solething between the two, Another spot would be better,

thought AMLASH.

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMLASI

said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris

statior) upon his return to Paris. (This he subsequently

did on the loth of November, according to info received

fron Paris-somewhat belatedly).

11. When AMASIl, A/l, and VENEGAS were together

in fome and Italy, VINEGAS

told ANLASH that people were

betting that LASHl would not return to Cuba.: Some hed also

questioned his nother on this point. AlASh reportedly

told VENEGAS to cover all the bets he could as he would

be a rich nan. (It das at this time, according to A/l,

that AMLASh decided that he had better return to lavara

12.

ANTASIl talked

about the two possibilities

of re-taking Cuba - either thru invasion by US troops, or

his way.

le also realized, however,

that invasion was

not to be considered serously at this time. Also, AMASIL

talked about his ability to take some men into the

hills

of Las Villas Province and taking the snell towns of

Trinivad nud Topes de Collantes.

He said that he and his

men could last no more than 15 days in the hills as tho

By the way A/1

talked, it is fairly certain that AMASHl realized that

this was not the kind of a plan which could even renotely

be expected to receive US aid. It 18 hoped that he

does realize

that Javana must first be taken... or failing

the rost of the island could be wrested from the Fidelistas

and the Concunists.
