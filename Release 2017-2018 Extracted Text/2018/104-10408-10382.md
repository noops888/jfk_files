the cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked
in our filea, vhere it was imedietely noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning the
Soviet Eubassy in Mexico City vas probably the Lee OSWALD vho had defected to
the Soviet Union in 1959 and returned to the USA in 1962. Ga 10 October 1963,
the day after the report from Hexico City, CIA Headquarters sent out a cabled
report akout Lee OSHALD's phone call to the Soviet Eubessy; the report went to
tha FSI, the Depertaent of State (because OSWALD vas a U.S. citizen), end to
the Reavy Department (because be vas 4 forwer Nerine). ‘The cabled report to these
agencies highlighted the Liklihood that the Lee OSWALD mentiosed vas probably the

As coon as the name of Lee CSHAID was mentioned in connection with the
assassination of Preaident Kennedy on 22 November, CIA file checks vere beg
and the Mexican station was agked by cable for more informetion on OSWAID.
Within a week, tuenty-seven cabled reports had been sent to the White House, the
State Department, ani the Far.

CIA field stations provided meny ltstw of informetion during the week
wm ofter the assassination. ‘The Nexioo City Station researched its telephone
tepe very thoroughly and came up with several more conversations probably
tavolving OSKAID, tut not actually mentioning this naues these connected him
also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Hexicens vere arrested
and questioned sbout his activities, giving a good picture of vbat be vas really

As poon 68 our Mexico City Station realized that Lee OSWALD vas the prima

House, the State Department, the Federal Buresu of Investigation.

COWAID's name ves not actually mentioned in these additional calls, tut

As far os our records show, CSWAID did not phone the Soviet or Cuban
Enbaseles again until Tuesday, 1 October 1963. ‘The intervening days vere o

A perticularly cinister asyect of OSWAID's dealings vith the Soviets in

Vindimirovich KOBEIKOV. In his 1 October phone call to the Soviet Eabassy,the
guard CHYEKOY suggests thet the Consul OSWALD bad talked to vas KOSTIVOY if he

ta Mts 9 Dower letter to the Soviet Coumlete tn Veshteuten, COVAED gives the

Eubessy guard Iven Ivanovich OBYSDKOY is himself believed to be a KGB
nah from previous assignments as a bodyguerd end survedliest. But umless sone
direct evidence of Soviet complicity is discovered, it is most likely that
CBRAID's dealing with KGB men OBYEDKXOV and KOSTIXOV was nothing more than a grin
coineidence, @ coincidence due in part to the Soviet habit of placing intelligance
men in the Eubessies tn positions where thay receive a large portion of the
viaitors ond phone calls. All of the five consular officers in the Soviet Exbesay

a

ere know or suspected intelligence officers. Although it io not usual for s

KOS agent on 4 sensitive misaion te have cuch overt contact with a Sovict
Fubassy, top secret Soviet intelligence docunents which ost forth Hilitery
Intelligence doctrine state that very inportant ageats can bo mat in official
installations using aa cover for their presence there soma sort of open
business. Thus, vbile it is unlikely that OSWALD's contacts with the Soviet -

Rubassy had a nore eintster purpose, it cannot te excluted.

Some insight on the Cuban attitude tovard the arrest of Silvia DURAN and
the involvement of the Cubsn Consulate in the OSWALD case can be gained from tyvo
intercepted phone calls nade betveen Cuben President Oevaldo DORTICOS ant Cuban
Azbosssdor to Mexico Josguin HERWANDRZ Armas on 26 Now 1963, the day after Silvia
DURAS was xeleased from her first srrest. At 09:40 AM that morning, President
DORTICOS phoned the Aubassador from Havana end asked him several questions sbout a
report which the Anbassadar hei seat in on the arrest of Silvia DURAN ani the
Lee OSWALD case. ‘The whole conversation is consistent with the theory that

OSiWAID merely weoted a visa. The Anbasendor did mention the altercation which

OSWALD had vith Consul AZCUB, eni he says that Maxtcan police trufsed Silvia
DURAU's arms a little shaking her to impress her with the importance of their
questions. ‘hey hai eaked her if she had been intimate with OSWAID end she had
