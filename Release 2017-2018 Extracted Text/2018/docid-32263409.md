Mr. Pocca.

That is correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. Off the reccic.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Rocca, do you understand that you

have a right to have counsel present today?

MI. Rocca. Yes, indeed.

Nir. Goldsmith. And do you waive that richt?

Mr. Rocca. I waive that right.

Mr. Goldsmith. At least for now.

Mir. Rocca.

Yep. I expect that I will be acle to judge

in terms of the caveats indicated here where to ask your

indulgence and just set aside and proceed.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine. No problem.

Have you received a cosy of the committee rules and

MI. Rocca. I have, indeeà. I mean, I've read it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you understand it as well?

Mr. Rocca.

understand it to the extent that it's

possible under these circumstances.

ir. Goldsmith. Do you have any questions about it now?

Mr. Rocca.

I have no questions about it now.

Mr. Goldsmith. Under the committee rules, Mr. Rocca,

a

witness has a right to receive a copy of a deposition transcript.

In other words, whenever a withess gives a deposition statement,

he has a right to receive a copy of the transcript.

However, the Central Intelligence Agency has asked the

comnittee to request of present and former Agency employees

waive their right actually to receive a copy of the transcript;

The Agercy is concerned that the transcript has classified

information in it and would not want the transcrint to leave

the committee's secure areas.

So, for that reason, I would like to ask you whether

you are willing to waive your right to receive a copy of the

transcript.

By doing so, however, you would still have the

full right to review the transcript for accuracy and to make

any necessary corrections. So, all you are waiving is your

right to receive

a copy.

Mr. Rocca.

I ao.

Let me say that membership in the Agency has long since

comported the waiving of constitutional rights ir various

respects.

This is simply another --

Mr. Goldsmith. I won't be asking you to waive any more

rights; I hope.

I would like you to know that the Court Reporter will

be asked to certify the transcript as a complete, accurate,

and true record of all the testimony given.

Mr. Rocca. Mill there be an opportunity to correct it?

There are mis-speakings and that kind of thing, whatever that

word means. It has just been coined in the last year or so,

"I mis-spoke."

Mr. Goldsmith. You will be given an opportunity to review

the transcript for accuracy. If, in your opinion: it is not

accurate, there is a procedure for rectifying those types of

problems.

Now, are you retired from the Central Intelligence Agency?

Mir. Rocca.

I am.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Have you received a copy of Acting

Director Carlucci's 23 March, 1978 letter which, for the

record, corresponds with JFK exhibit number 94?

Mr. Rocca.

23 March, 1978 -- I have.

Mr. Goldsmith. That is the letter that specifically

discusses

the question of secrecy agreements and

Mr. Rocca.

Yes.

It also contains caveats which protect the continued

interest in sources and in methods, which I regara as adequate

under the circumstances, and therefore I accept this, and I

understand.

Mr. Goldsmith. You understand that letter?

Mr. Rocca. Yes. He wants me to tell you all you need

to know in order to get your job done.

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

I believe the letter indicates that so long as questions

relevant to the committee's mandate are addressed to the

witness, the Agency is authorizing you to answer those questions.

I would like to have this marked and offered as an

exhibit.

(The document referred to was marked Rocca Exhibit

Number 1.)

Mr. Rocca. I judge that this is the standard type

of thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

December, 1974.

in 1963?

conversations at about that time, which informed me of this

decision. In other words, it was not a thing that I sought.

Mr. Golasmith. Before we go into your responsibilities

in more detail, would you describe for the record what the

Counter Intelligence Research and Analysis staff did in 1953?

In other words, what was the purpose of that unit?

MI. Rocca.

The unit was designed to bring to bear

analytical intelligence, analytical brainpower, which meant

all source, all overt source comprehension: a study of cases

that had ceased to occupy operational significance, that is,

closed cases; to maintain the ongoing record of overall

quality and quantity of counter intelligence being performed

by the entire DDP operational component: to -- operational

component -- the Deputy Director for Plans.

Mr. Goldsmith. That's just in caps -- DDP.

Mr. Rocca. DDP -- I have listed now three functions,

broadly speaking. To keep the community informed on the

organization's structure and operational potential, that is,

the threat of all intelligence services throughout the world,

that is, by supervising the writing of an encyclopedic

publication, which was cälled the NIS Section 56 at that time.

This was a specific responsibility of the component.

In other words, it was a research support for operational

components. The final major function, and this is important,

is training. We were responsible for the sucervision and

performance of CI training.

So, we kept the CI indicators, the overall record of

CI organization throughout the world -- that is, the adversary

services -- we worked on cases when they had ceased to be of

direct concern to the operational components, and tried to make

relationships between cases.

We were concerned, obviously, on the training side in

working with other parts of the intelligence community, as

well as training inside, and so forth.

I think that those five broad topics -- I could narrow

them down --

Mr. Goldsmith. No, that's fine.

Mr. Rocca. I think this is sufficient to get us started

Mr. Goldsmith. Who was in charge of the CIA's investigation

into the assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, there was no formal

provision for investigation. The investigation was the FBI's

--

not.CIAls responsibility.

Mr. Goldsmith. Within CIA, isn't it fair to say that

initially Jack Whitter was given responsibility for conducting

the investigation?

Mr. Rocca. I don't want to nit-pick your language, but

that was not an investigative responsibility, as I understood

it.

The GP Floor phase, which he headed up --

Floor phase.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you define for the record what

GP Floor is?

Mr. Rocca. GP Floor

was the code name assigned by the

DDP, by Mr. Helms and Mr. Karamissines and the desks, to

characterize cable traffic during the initial phase of the

Agency's relationship with the various authorities and with

its own organizations or components overseas. This is a

code facilitation, a telegram or telegraphic consideration.

And, during that phase, it was indeed Mr. Whitten's respon

sibility. I think he did an extremely good job.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, GP Floor was a code name which was

assigned to cable traffic pertaining to the Kennedy assassination,

is that correct?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, during the period of

November through January, and then it was phased out.

Mr. Goldsmith. And. Mr. Whitten initially had

responsibility for --

Mr. Rocca. Coordinating traffic, for working with the

Dop with respect to what was being done over the whole world,

as far as I know. This was before I got into it.

Mr. Goldsmith. After Mr. Whitten no longer had

responsibility in that area, who took over the responsibility

for coordinating the Agency's investigation?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, there was no further

Mr. Goldsmith. Nevertheless, without a cryptonym being

assigned to it--

Mr. Rocca. And therefore cables would go to the DDP,

would go to Mr. Helms or Mr. Karamissines, the various desks.

In other words, it became a decentralized responsibility.

In other words, there wasn't, as far as I can make

out, a formal placement of

an investigative responsibility.

Mr. Goldsmith. Informally, ho --

Mr. Rocca. I became -- or the CI staff and I for the

staff became then -- because by that time a commission had

been formed -- had "become the point of contact for the

commission.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, informally, the CI staff was

responsible for coordinating the CIA's investigation?

Mr. Rocca. This is where I wonder about the use of the

term -- that is, whatever we had done, whatever we were to do

or did to assist the Warren Commission focused in the staff.

Mr. Goldsmith. In the CI staff.

Mr. Rocca. In the CI staff.

Mr. Goldsmith. At the time, who was in charge of the

CI staff?

Mr. Rocca. Mr. Angleton, and Mr. Hunt was his deputy.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Was that Mr. E. Howard Hunt?

Mr. Goldsmith.

For the record, who is Mr. Hunt?

Mr. Rocca.

Mr. Hunt was Mr. James Hunt, a totally

different person.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why the responsibility for

providing information to the Warren Commission was given to

the CI staff as opposed to Mr. Whitten?

Mr. Rocca. I do not.

I would juage -- and I am guessing now, this is purely

a guess - I never discussed it with him - that as Chief of

the Mexican Desk, which was his former job, the whole parameter

of the case had shifted from its initial phase of October and.

November, where traces came up involving his files and his

handling of the initial leads that developed out of the

Mexican resources, and that he no longer regarded it as

really his primary responsibility.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there any conflict between

Mr. Angleton and Mr. Whitter regar&ing the manner in which the

investigation was to be conducted?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, there was none, and I

did not hear of any at the time -- or since.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that initially Mr. Whitten

was given responsibility for the investigation and that

Mr. Angleton in some manner interceded in the investigation

being conducted by Mr. Whitten?

Mr. Rocca. If so, I do not know this and cannot

sustain that allegation, by any information direct or indirect.

lI have never heard it even as hearsay.

By the whole line of questioning, I judge that you

have your own interests.

Really, Mr. Whitten sat here (indicating) in a

small

desk in WH for the Mexican area.. He was in a position

to develop through the assets of the Mexico station extremely

interesting material, which at the time was not recognized,

obviously, as pertaining to anything like what came out of it

in October of late September, and that was entirely appropriate

to the WH division and area, and functional division.

Mr. Goldsmith. WH stands for western Hemisphere?

Mr. Rocca. Western Hemisphere -- not White House --

underline that, please, because this is another of the canards.

As I say, it was entirely appropriate in the GP Floor

phase that he would have that. But the minute you had a

commission set up outside the line obviously had to be the

Director, and from the Director to his Chief of Operations

overseas, because the spread

involved then all of the divisions.

Here you had Mr. Whitten

being

asked to sign off on cables

that had to do with Netherlands, with U.K., with Australia,

and it would have seemed to me utterly administratively simply

hybrid monster.

So, in effect, the concentration of supervisory

authority on the assistance being given the warren Commission

once they got underway was something, as I uncerstand it,

negotiated between the Commission itself and Mr. Helms.

Mr. Angleton was present.

I may have been present at the

meeting which decided that i & A would be the point of reference.

I cannot recall.

But there is a memorandum -- off the record -- there

and you should have it.

Mr. Goldsmith.

There is a memorandum for the record

which indicates -

Mr. Rocca.. In January, which indicates how that thing

got off. And it dispells, I think, any idea that there was

some kind of internal machination.

vir. Goldsmith. Where would that memorandun for the

record be found - because we have reviewed many files and

have not come across that particular memoranaum?

Mr. Rocca. Well, it shoula be founa in the file.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would it be in the Oswald file?

Mr. Rocca. It would be in the Oswald file, and it

should be around January.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who is the author of that memorandum?

Mr. Rocca. The author of that memorancum must have

been Mr. Helms himself, or MI. Karamissines.

It reflected

conversations that tookplace with Mr. Rankin. It may be a

Warren Commission memorandum.

Mr. Coldsmith.

Would you be able to locate that

memorandum for the committee?

In other words, do you still have a relationship with

the Agency which would permit you to obtain that memorandum?

Mr. Rocca. Well: if you could arrange it for me to go

out there, I would.

Can we have a little bit of a diversion now and perhaps

go off the record? I want to ask about a number of other

people who helped, who would know this.

Mr. Golásmith. Fine. Let's go off the record for a

moment.

But I don't want to go off the record a whole lot

in this deposition.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's go back on the record.

Mr. Rocca.

I have no formal knowledge of it by

direction or indirection, or hearsay.

Mr. Goldsmith. By "it" you are referring to --

coordination of what the Agency was doing, from WH, Mr. Whitten,

to the staff. This was an utterly logical and completely

what I would call inevitable in terms of cost effectiveness and

everything else.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the shift take place right at the

time that the Warren Commission was established?

Mr. Rocca. I have in memory the date 12 January, and

this is something that just comes now right out of my head.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Mr. Rocca.

So, it was pursuant to that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why was the responsibility for the

investigation -- I am using that now in an informal sense,

because I think you feel more comfortable with that - why was

the responsibility given to CI staff as opposed to some other

staff within the DDP?

Mr. Rocca. Because that's our business. CI has

the business of dealing with activity involving espionage,

sabotage, subversion, terrorism, and the whole works.

It is

spelled out in 1-1, Chapter 5. You will find that absolutely

stated formally.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, of all the units within the CIA

in 1963, the CI staff, you are saying, was best suited to be

responsible for this?

Mr. Rocca. That's right, yes, because, in addition, th

staff had the résponsibility for the DDP, for maintaining the

relations, the liaison relations, with the office of security

within the Agency itself, the office of security, and with the

FBI and other agencies. This was by directive 1-1, Chapter 5.

I underline the importance of 1-1, Chaoter 5.

Mr. Goldsmith. That is the CI staff charter?

Mr. Rocca. Charter -- and this shift was precisely

directly in line with the implications of that charter.

This

is my reading now in retrospect.

Mr. Goldsmith. What was the line of reporting within

the CIA with regard to information that was relevant to the

assassination? By line of reporting I mean once information

was

received, who did it go to?

I am talking now about the time the CI staff was

responsible for the investigation.

Mr.

Rocca. There were -- this is where you are going

off, because the CI staff never displaced Mr. Helms in his

direct relations with the Commission. The CI staff never

displaced the direct relations between the Soviet Division,

Mr. Murphy, Mr. Bagley, with the Commission. The CI staff

never displaced the direct relations between Mr. Whitten --

even after it had taken over. In other words, it was a

decentralized approach.

Now the material that did come through of a substantive

nature developed by these components, and particularly the

soviet division, were brought down in the normal flow of day

Mr. Arthur Dooley -- D-O-O-L-E-Y -- a former member of the

FBI who had transferred to the Agency many years before.

Now these people actually were dealing with the actual

working level in the various divisions, or the various

divisional elements, particularly in SB, would be working

with me.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's see if we can clarify this for

a moment.

Overall responsibility was in the hands of Mr. Helms.

Mr. Rocca. That's correct. Now you're talking -- and

that never changed.

Mr. Goldsmith. That never changed from the very beginning?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I am concerned, Mr. Helms was in

charge, and Mr. Karamissines, his deputy, when he was not there.

For sensitive aspects, Mr. Angleton and these two were in

charge, or the division people.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was Mr. Angleton heavily involved in

the investiation, other than occasional sensitive matters

that arose?

Mr. Pocca. I think not. I think this is a correct

meetings.

Let me give you an example of what I have in mina.

Though I was the working level point of contact

with the committee, that is, I knew Mr. Slawson in particular,

and worked, I believe, closely and profitably with him, and

without reservation, there was another historian. In any

event, I was not cleared for the Nosenko case. So, I did not

attend ary of the discussions that took place on that matter,

and that, too, is a matter of formal record.

You should find that record to back that up -- if you

have not found it.

In other words, if you are looking for a fixed point of

investigation here, you have to keep in mind that again, you

haâ access to sources and methods and compartmentation was

observed, notwithstanding the fact that I was the working

level point of contact.

Mir. Goldsmith. So, the Nosenko case would be an

example of a situation where Mr. Angleton would have been

involved.

Mr. Rocca. It was Mr. Murphy.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was Mr. Angleton involved as well?

Mr. Rocca. I don't think he was at the meeting that

concerned it over at the warren

delicious experience of being asked to leave at a certain

Mr. Goldsmith. What would

that would prompt Mr. Angieton to have been involved

in the investigation?

fir. Pocca.

oh, he would have known all of that.

Whatever else, I have no similar story to tall about him.

I have the one 10 tell about myself aná the Nosenko case, which

I was not cleared for.

Mr.

Goldsmith.

But

earlier you said that other then

sensitive matters, is. Ingleton basically was not involved

in the investigation.

I am wondering if you can give an

example of a sensitive matter:

Mir. Rocca.

Well, I would imagine all of the matters

involving the intercept of correspondence, of Oswald's

correspondence - which I saw in 1975.

Mr. Goldsmith.

so, ir 1963, when you were working on

this case, you did not see the correspondence, the cable-traffic:

from Mexico City to CIA headquarters reporting Oswald's

contact?

Mr. Rocca. Very definitely that is not the case and

¡that is not what I said.

I'm talking about the correspondence intercented.

Mr. Goldsmith. Which intercent are you talking

about?

Mr. Rocca. I am talking

about the intercepted mail

¡correspondence.

Mr. Colasmiti. Okay.

You are talking about the ADLINGUAl program?

Mr. Pocca.

I'm talking about that material. Fe would

¡have hancied that.

And indeed, when I read it in 1375, it was clear that

Mr. Papich had come over on Saturcay morning and had taken

all of the material on that file. But that was the first time

¡I knew that that part of -- in other words, there was very

strict compartmentation utilized within the whole groun in

¡order to protect sources and methods at the time that we weze

attempting to help this body.

That's the point that I'm

trying to make.

Mr. Angleton's role would have been, I vould have

imagired, in that connection.

1r. Goldsmith. Mas Mi. Angleton's role peripheral or

central to the investigation?

Mr. Rocca. How can you say with an asset like that

that it could be pericheral? I don't know, because I was not

privy to the materials. But I could guess that it must have

been important for him to but that material of Paçich's to use

immediately.

Mir. Goldsmith.

Well, now much material was generated

py

the HdLINGuAL program?

Mr. Rocca. I have no way of really recalling. It was

substantial file and I see no reason why you shouldn't have it.

Then you can answer the question yourself.

Me. Goldsmith. I want to explain to you, Mr. Rocca,

that the mere fact that --

Mr. Rocca. I don't nean to be impertinent.

Mr. Goldsmith. -- files anc documents are mace available!

to us doesn't necessarily mean shat the files and documents

are accurate.

One of the reason for taking deposition statements

is because files and statements are not alvays accurate. In

fact, one of the purposes of this committee is to verify the

accuracy of the Agency's own files.

Nir. Rocca. I take your point on that.. Let me say that

in ohe respect, for that reason, the oswald file, which was

the file that R & A kept, that is, the material pertaining

i to

the 201 file -- you can be sure is the file because it

was computerized, and you can't change the computer order

without leaving a record. Therefore you can be sure that

everything that went into it is still in it.

Mr. Soldsmith. With regard to the HOLINGUAI. file, you

indicate before,: I believe, that the file was a thick one.

HIs that true?

Mr. Rocca. No, not thick... It must have contained

seven or eight letters or so. But the man who woald know

¡exactly is Mr. Birch O'Neill. He headed the project.

Mr. Goldsmith.

we've spoken to. Mr. Birch 'Neill.

Mr. Rocca.

Of course not.

Mr. Goldsmith. To the best of your recollection, how

many Oswald intercepts were there in the EDDINGUAL program?

Mr. Rocca.

Oh, this would be -- if you have to --

as I say, I read it in 1975 at the moment the Rockefeller

Commission was coming in. I'm sure they looked at the whole

thing -- Mr. Ford, or whatever is the name of the individual

who was concerned. I went through it cursorily with Mrs. Matson.

She is the person who handed me the file. There must have

been five, or six, or seven. But this is pure guess. There may

be twelve, there may be three -- I can't say.

was there more than one?

Mr. Rocca.

Oh, there was more than one.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Getting back to the question of organization, I think

I understand from your testimony --

Mr. Rocca.

: When I say more than one, it involves both

ends, that is, materials going out from Mrs. Oswald and material

coming in from him. I don't know what the proportion is or

even if there were things coming in, or if it was confined

solely to things going out.

Finally, getting back to the question of organization,

very clearly that in terms of overall responsibility: it was

in the hands of Mr. Helms.

•Is that correct?

Mr. Rocca.

That is correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. Other than that, I think you have

indicated that the investigation was decentralized to some

extent in that different area divisions, primarily western

Hemisphere and Soviet Europe were sending information upstream

to headquarters -- and there may have been other divisions

¡as well sending irformation, but primarily it was western

Hemisphere and Soviet Russia -- is thât correct?

were to leave no stone unturnec.

Mr. Goldsmith. And were MI. Helms orders generally

followed?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, they were followed to the

letter, by all that I know of.

Mr. Goldsmith.

so, if you were asking different

to the FBI's?

Mr. Rocca.

Well, as you have already detected, I

object, I think, in principle to the use of the word

"investigation," to apply to the CIA.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, how would you like me to phrase

the question?

I would be glac to do that.

Mr. Rocoa. But at times it made use of investigative

techniques. But I have read enough Bureau reports to know

that on a matter of this kind, the primary investicative

responsibilities were in the comestic authorities, and that

investigations done abroad, even those, were repeated by

the bureau.

Mr Goldsmith. So, the Bureau, in effect, was

conducting an investigation overseas?

Mr. Rocca. The Bureau was the primary investigative

authority.

Mr. Goldsmith. In light of that point -- which is

exactly the point I was trying to rake in terms of trying

to determine what the different areas of responsibilities

were between the Bureau and CIA -- in light of that point,

what was the responsibility of the CIA?

¡ Mr. Rocca. The CIA was to turn over and to develo

any information bearing on the assassination that could be

of assistance to the Warrer Commission.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was that information given directly

to the Marren Commission or directly to the Bureau?

Mr. Rocca. It was given to both in many cases.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, even though the PI isn't

are you saying that in effect the Bureau was the agency

Mr. Rocca

-- authorized, I think is in a grey area,

and where it was never contested that they had primary

investigations.

Mr. Goldsmith. What was the role of Mt. Mecone?

Mr. Rocca. I had no meetings with him during that

period that I can recall, at all.

I have nothing to say that would bear on this.

I am sure he authorized comolte support.

Mr. Goldsmith. But in terms of actual involvement

in the CIA's work in this area, do you know what his

responsibilities were?

Mr. Pocca. No. I can't speak to that.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like now for you to refer

to a document which I will call CIA number 1876. FOr

Mr. Goldsmith. And at that time there was no particular

interest in Oswala, I take it.

so, do you know how that rather why that photograph

was

taken by the CIA officials involved?

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

It was one of a series of pictures turned in by these

two ladies in the normal course of what is the authorized

mission of contacts division, at that time located in the DDI:

of turning up useful foreign intelligence on -- by Americans,

who volunteer. That picture, on the extreme left, hac a

crane in it, an industrial item, in which we were specifically

interested.

That was the way the photograph had been selected!

That crane was cropped out when the picture was published.

Mr. Goldsmita.

Thank you.

That clarifies an important issue for us:

Did the CIA's effort to support the Warren Commission

by providing the Commission with relevant information reflect

any working hypotheses?

In other words, did the Poency say

that certain areas were to receive primary emphasis?

wr. Rocca. I can't speak for all of these other

authorities that were in touch.

I can speak only for what

on

the assumption that a person who spenas four years in the

As a consequence, we lavored very strongly that the questions

that were to be delivered

to the Soviet Union for response

should include very specific inquiries with respect to what

he did -- not just this hospital record,

as it turned out,

135 pages of it - but just exactly what he did. And, as far

as I know, these were excellent questions. They, too, have:

been released.

I have not reviewed ther.

They would still

be useful questions to answer.

The Reporter. Excuse me, but did you say they have

or have not been released?

Mr. Rocca. They have been released, so far as I knov.

I am not sure of that.

There were three pages.

Mr. Golasmit. Okay, let's not talk about those questions.

My question is a general one.

Which areas received emphasis?

Mr. Rocca. The areas that we concentrated or tended

to concentrate on were the Soviet areas because the people he

was in touch with in Mexico had traces, prior traces: as

KGB people.

They were there under consular cover and obviously

could have been doing and were uncoubtedly doing

job in those aarlier contacts.

That is correct; but it has other things

sabotage.

So, the assassination thing should not be highlighted.

Mr. Rocca.

Other defectors that had gone to the

Soviet Union and had been processed in particular ways, his

documentation, his ability to travel anà avoid internal

controls which were exceptional under the circumstances:

reviews of books that were coming out.

Mr. Goldsmith. But again, the overall focus was

Mr. Rocca. I would say, on balance, that was,

as it

came out on our side of it.

Mr. Goidsmith. Fine.

I have another question, before I forget to ask you it;

in

reference to CIA number 1876.

That first paragraph says, "In addition, on sensitive

matters of concern to the investigation, Dick Helms and Murphy

also dealt directly with the connission."

MI. Rocca.

Which was, of course, in the central.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

were there any other sensitive matters that you can

think of?

Mr. Rocca.

That's the only one that I know of.

No.

Let me say that this was a very hastily put together memorandum

and I dia it jeallyin order to have something on the record.

I am delighted I dia, too. I have no regrets. But it could

have been more ample.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the Warren Commission give the

Agency input as to what kind of information it wanted, what

types of leads should be pursued?

Mr. Rocca. Oh, yes.

That was what I was coming to when you asked the other

things that were done.

Well, I was not investigating the thing.

had received all the relevant information, my question was

so you think that the anti-Castro assassination plots were

relevant to the Warren

¿ Commission's investigation?

Mr. Rocca. My feeling is -- my answer to that question

is that this is a political diversion and that no political

action -- I an now speaking with 20-20 hinäsight -- that no

political action undertaken of the kind that has been described

and it has been described in various ways -- in any case sould

have justified action against the President. That I have to

regard, therefore, as a totally different set of facts.

If the Warren Commission had had it, I don't know what

they could have cone with it beyond what they did, and they

may have known about it. There is indication, at least press

references, that Warren did indeed know and had been told

about these things.

I can never say that Mr. Dulles, who was aboard when

the cuban thing started but had left it, didn't talk about it

on a personal basis.

But in any case, I consider it a

political diversion.

In other words, attempting - anything that was being

attempted against Castro through low level agents and all the

rest doesn't justify this kind of activity of --

Mr. Goldsmith. Assassinating President Kennedy.

MiT.

-- assassinating President Kennedy. I thinks

the whole thought is outrageous.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, your position, then, is that even

though the Agency may have been attempting to assassinate

Premier Castro through low level agents, that would not justify

a retaliation attempt?

Mr. Pocca. Retaliation -- absolutely, absolutely,

absolutely.

Now, mind you, the Harker interview is a very clear

indication -- there is no question about it --

Mr. Goldsmith. Incication of what, sir?

vir. Rocca.. That there were political -- that there

were terminal risks invoived in persisting in attempts to

use cuban exiles. My understanding is, though, that that

interview was considered by those people who were engagaged in

this kind of activity in the Agency and in the community.

But I was not privy to it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Had you known about the anti-Castro

assassination plots, would you have given more focus, more

emphasis, to the possibility of a Cuban responsibility for

the assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr.

Rocca.

I would have done it anyway, in view of

the fact that he

was

in touch with the Cuoans.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, earlier when we asked you --

Mr.

interest.

The answer to your question is yes.

Cuban possibility.

ME.

that on balance the primary area of amphasis was the soviet

" Mr.

Rocca.

That was certainly the one that I would

Mr. Goldsmith.. Now, hac you known about the anti-Castro

assassination plots on the past of the CIA, would you have given

more priority, more emphasis, to the possibility of a Castro

conspiracy to kill the Fresident?

MI..

Rocca.

Again, I say that it would have simply

intensified it, that there was attention given to it, not

particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities on the

Cuban side.

The organization of their service and their operation

in Mexico was something entirely entirely within -- it was

an

enigna at the time. They were just getting started. This was

WH's area. This was win Scott's area of proficiency. So

the defectors had only begur to come out and they came out

later, the Cubar defectors.

So, I can't -- I really can't say that (a) the Cuban

connectior was ignored, because it wasn't. The press was

filled with it at the time.

The Harker interview should have been undoubtedly given

Earlier I asked you which area received emphasis and

I believe you indicated that the Soviet area.

Mr. Rocca. Primarily, primarily. But I didn't mean

by that that it excluded the Cuban, because there was a lot

of material that came through and went to the Commission

that concerned the Cubans.

effort would have been intensified.

Is that a fair statement?

Mr. Pecca. Well, I would have -- certainly I think

it would have been intensified. Everything would have been

intensified.

When did you first learn of the

plots?

Mr. Rocca.. There were rumors of these activities

in the mid and late 'el's.

The first significant indication that I had that there

was Castro appreciation of an actual plot was the reference

to the Harker article in the Mexico City case log, which we

had accessioned for the file sometime in the late '50's, after

Win Scott's death, when Mexico City shipped its documentation

up here.

Are you familiar with Book 5 of the

No.

Of the assassination plots?

it at the Library of congress in the course of the work that

I did for the Rockefeller Commission.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, during. the time that you were working

with the Rockefeller Commission for the Agency, you were on

contract?

Mir. Rocca. Yes.

• Are we clear on that?

Mr. Goidsmith. And at that time

Mir. Rocca. Des Fitzgerald's letter:

Mr. Goldsmith. AMLASH.

Mr. Rocca.

AMLASH, exactly.

AMLASH.

This letter turned up. It was found by a Wu researcher:

a

This was 1975.

And

so you were

asking me earlier how could I be

sure

that everything had been delivered to the staff. You see, I

mean, it's just not possible to taire the responsibility.

Of

course it wasn't. That letter had never been seen by me.

Mr. Goldsmith. That was just another example of

anti-Castro plot information that was not brought to your

attention?

Mr. Rocca. Des Fitzgerald, it is well known, very

closely associated with the Kennedys in political action anc

there is no question but that he had total legitimacy in

undertaking what he was doing.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am not questioning the legitimacy.

I am only questioning wather you had the information.

Mr.

Belin was in touch with everyboay, so he

could have.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, do you think that you were given

letter and asked to respond just to one paragraph in it?

•Mr. Rocca. Or to respond more generally to the question

of the background of Cuban Inowledge. They were not so specific

as this, because if I had received this as a basis, as a brief,

I would have had to research it. You see, I would have had to

go, then, and ask people. This would have been not only

presumptuous, but it would have taken years.

Mr. Goldsmith. That problem now that appears in the

record is that there was a letter that was given to you to

respond to, anc we have the responses to paragraph number three!

of that letter.

It would appear that you were asked to

respond to a letter that you did not have all of the complete

information with which to make a proper response as to the

entire letter.

Mr:

Rocca. Yes. But my answer doesn't say that I

hac the original letter. It says that it responds to a paragraph

of

it.

I may have been

shown it and used it as a point of

reference.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Mr.

Rocca. With Mr. Belin, I had hours of conversations

across the desk in the most amicable fashion in which he

understood precisely my feelings and how they had matured over

I would have told hin would have been that to answer those

Anyway, that is the best of my recollection at this

that right now.

MI. Rocca.

Hell, it would take longer than that to write

it, so

I think we ought to just discuss it -- though I'm not

adverse. to the other, it would really require the preparation

of

a monograph.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Please, as best you can, realizing the time constraints,

briefly summarize what you reant by that sentance.

Mir. Rocca. First of all, let me say that to Mr. Belin

personally in the talks I made it perfectly clear that I

regarded the theory that oswald as a mandated assassin by

lany foreign intelligence or any other intelligence service to

be

false and that there was no credible evidence to

sustain

ithat view that he was a

mandated assassin, that this could not

pe done on the basis of the availaole evidence, or as I refer

to it here, credible evidence.

Indeed, I regarded it as very

dangerous and counterproductive -- if I can use that term --

inculge in public conversation along those lines, because it

leads inevitably to political consequences which are absolutely

impossible to control.

so, I don't believe, in other words, in my personal

yiew of the case, in the

position that I held in which I

operated with the Commission that he was sent to kill kennedy.

Rouper, I do believe that he

had contacts with

the

soviet

intelligence, or I think the evidence is stronger and certainly

worth following up, that he had contacts with the KGB, both

inside and probably outside. I'm not saying in the United

States, necessarily, but before his arrival, with the KGB,

first.

Second, that the soviets did not furnish us all of

the relevant documentation pertaining to his stay in the soviet

Union and that the contradictions, therefore, between what

they served up through the swiss and what we have derived

from people who have come out of the KGB, who are experts

on this -- I don't care whether you call them, whether they

are Nosenko, or Deriabin or Golitzin, whoever - the neople

in the other service there -- there is a manifest contradiction

between the amount of material that they furnished and what

would have beer normally his experience ir that country in

respect to that service,

and in particular with regard to the

element of contract and debriefing by the "Snetsotdel"

",but

the 13th Department, by the Special Department.

The questions that were furnished the Commission along

those lines were not delivered by the State Department, or

whatever happened. Therefore, we got no answers.

And, they

served to deepen, therefore, the importance and the occasions

of what I've just said.

In the third place, the people, fortunately or

unfortunately, casually or otherwise, that he was in touch

with in Nexico City during his trip, were KGB, according to

the traces

Mr. Golcsmith. Do you recall which people these were?

Mr. Rocca. . I can't -- I could probably get them

out of my mind.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please proceed.

Mr. Rocca. It is absolutely patent that these people

could have been dealing with him and possibly were dealing with

him. I give, in other words, full faith and credit to all

these

theories,

and I'm talking now in a counter intelligence

laboratory sense, not in a public sense.

His whole comportment

as an individual in the United States after his arrival I find

very peculiar for its implicit and explicit evidences of

clardestinity.

vir. Goldsmith. Mould you give examples.

Mr.

Rocca.

The utilization of aliases in boarding

houses, incomplete details to his own wife, the whole matter

of the

"Walker"

and what she says, and Marina is a whole other.

story that has to be, I think, readjusted to this scenario.

On the other hand, I see flaws in his clandestine,

in his trade craft, let's put it that way. It makes me

believe that he may not have beer at the time that he was

operating in Dallas and in the other area an actual, even

in touch with them, because I regard not giving his wife his

alias at the boarding house so that when she phoned she blew

him as just one of those things.

But I have gone over all of this in great detail with

Beiin. So, I see these things, I see these things as building

a picture of much more detailed knowledge about him, and

of flight.

Mr. Pocca. And, on the Cuban side, from Delgado we

know he was a pro-cuban from the beginning, and the Delgado

information is critical -- I think quite undeveloped in its

implications.

So, it is this kind of thing that lies behind leaving

the window open. In other words, there would be information

relevant to an assessment of this man's motives as a self

activated killer in ar incredible conjunction which finds him

in a building which is going to be passed by by Cornally:

against whom he has a personal quarrel, going back to the whole

matter of his Navy career, and this whole business of what

he could have read in the "Fimes Picayune" about the Harkes

interview, the warning, and so forth.

I regard this, in other woras, this man, as a sels

generated killer, who could

very well have done this. But

that doesn't mean that there isn't information, not only in

Moscow, but also in Havana. But, as I said, this is a thing

simply listening to accounts and meetings that were very

So. I knew it only in very general terms.

responsibility.

Mr. Goldsmith. But other than the HDLINGUAL program,

everything else that went through your office --

• Mr. Rocca.

To the best of my knowledge, there was

nothing that my office handled that was backstopped, that mas

shortstopped or not given, as far as I know.

Mr. Golasmith. Did Allen Dulles play any special

role on the warren Commission, insofar as the CIA was

concerned?

MiT.

Rocca.

If so, I don't know.

I was in no position to really be -- I was not in a

position to really have that degree of intimacy.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether he in any way

attempted to represent the interest of the Agency?

Mr. Rocca: It would have been unusual for him to

have done that, although he was certainly

used. as a channel

by the Chief Justice on matters--

Mr. Goldsmith. Coula

you give us some examples?

Mr. Rocca.--of specific interest to the Commission,

growing out of their own discussions. I would say that there

is in the file a memorandum written by Mr. Murphy, Chief

$B, reflecting conversation at Mr. Dulles' house on some

matter that Mr. Dulles had been asked to probe or to get

information on. I recall that ard it shoul be available in

the record.

Well, the executive sessions of the Commission show

that they used Mr. Dulles as a kind of backboard for all kinds

of extraordinary hypothetical, I think.

Mr. Goldsmith. For the record, are you able to give

any examples of those types of situations, to your personal

knowleage?

Mir.

Rocca. From my personal knowledge, no. I mean,

have read the executive session records and they are

pertinent.

But not to my personal knowledge. In other words,!

Mr. Dulles never discussed this with me nor was I ever

present at any of those discussions on such points.

Mr. Goldsmith. It has been alleged in the press that

Mr. Rocca: I am delianted I wrote it.

MI. Goldsmith -- does it pertain to a meeting that

you had with Mr. Dulles?

Mr. Rocca. Indeed. But it was not on the purpose

of the memorancum. It was on the purpose of

a totally

different -- of a IV presentation of a defector,

and inasmuch

as the question was how the defector should be photographed,

all the rest, this was the topic now entirely collaterally --

and incidentally, this other thing came us which, of course,

waS

one of Mr. Dulles' things.

He had these and he called

this to my attention.

He wrote the answer, declining, and I reported it.

Mr. Goldsmith. By this other thing, we are now talking

about the question of the warren

Commission being concerned

with the issue of Oswald having been a CIA agent.

MI.

Rocca. The press, the press had had it.

Mr. Goldsmith. The Warren Commission wanted to resolve

that issue.

They had asked Dulles to serve as a contact with

the Agency as a means of expediting the resolution of this

issue.

Is that correct?

What role, if any, did the Mexico City station have

in providing CIA headquarters with information relevant to

the warren Commission?

Mr. Rocca.

It had a key role. It produced information

before the fact and it conducted a whole series of followup

activities on the material that it hac provided, plus other

material that came in in the course of dealing with people

who were in touch with the embassy and facilitating the FBI.

So, they were important. They were ore of the most significant

parts.

Mr. Goldsmith. That was my next question.

Relative to other stations, was the role played by

the Mexico City station

a major one?

Mr. Goläsmith. Did the Mexico City station have any

surveillance operations in effect in 1953 against the Cuban

and Soviet Embassy and Consulates?

Mr. Rocca. They did, as fax as these cables indicate.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall; generally, what types

of surveillance operations there were?

Mr. Rocca. They must have been telephone and

photographic.

Mr. Goldsmith. As a result of these surveillance

operations, was information pertaining to Oswald obtaine?

SIr. Rocca. Information rertaining to an unidentified

American was obtained and subsequently it was ascertained

that that unidentified American was Oswald. Anc, eventually,

it became associated with the body of the assassination case.

The only reason. I raise that guestion

identified himself as Oswald.

that the calls came from the Cuban embassy?

Mr. Rocca. I have no idea of the time. They must have

been told very early because the whole community was told on

october 10, or October 3, or whatever.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, that's when the community was

told.

However, the community was not necessarily told that

there was a telephone tap operation. They were just tola about

the contact.

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. My impression is a very narrow one.

When was the Warren Commission specifically told that

Oswald had been in telephonic contact?

I can't account for it or undersand why he did not --

Mr. Colasmith. This memo is dated 1 April, 1964.

The statement in the meno indicates that the CIA has reported

to the Commission that oswald was observed in mid-morning

in the office of the soviet military attache in Mexico City.

I'm not süggesting that the statement is accurate.

But the reasor. that we are concerned about it is because in

fact it apnears to suggest that this is what the Commission

staff was told.

Do you know anything about that?

Mr. Rocca. No.

the Oswald contact, without being specifically told about

Mr. Rocca.

I think not. I don't think so at all.

I mean, Mr. Slawson was given the actual text of

that

earlier telegram..

The intercept, as I recall, was from the

Cuban Embassy to the Soviet Embassy. Osvald - this was a

Saturday - Oswald had gone over and so forth.

So, this word, this is a mis-speaking again --

"observed." "observed" is the wrong word. He had been

reportea by, to have

been in the office.

This is a conclusion from the intercept. No one

can

draw any conclusion further than that.

Mr. Goldsmith. If we go and study this paragraph

carefully, it is apparent that the information that they are

relying upon here is the information that came directly from

the teiephonic intercept.

Mr. Rocca. Which was rendered in its entirety -

Mir. Goldsmith. Do the Commissior staff?

Mr.

Rocca. -- to the Commission staff.

That's my best recollection.

Mr. Goldsmith. You can tell from the way that the

author approaches this issue that he is talking about visual

observation.

Here he is concerned, in the rest of the paragraph

he is concerned about the possibility that this agency may

nave pickea Oswalá up under photographic surveillance.

Is it clear to you that he is referring to visual

observation?

But

the nature ci the evidence precluded absolutely disguising it

As far as I know,

there was never any attempt to

Probably not, if this is the only one

would be any question of fuzzing up the record on cables.

You see, it's a question of getting the dates.

The 27th to the 2nà -- I'm sorry.

Mr. Goldsmith. That was my first question.

If Oswald contacted the Soviet Embassy telephonically

on 1 october, why would it have taken eight days for the cable

reporting that contact to be sent to headquarters?

Mr. Rocca. An American male who spoke broken Russiar

well, the answer to the question is not difficult to comprehend.

There is a lead time in the processing of material. There are

a lot of leads coming in that have to be selected -- spotted,

selected, translated, evaluated, and then cabled. But what

disturbs me here is the time.

Mr. Golasmith. What specifically about the time

disturbs you?

Mr. Rocca. Well: it seems to me too late, that

communication began earlier from Mexico City. But I can't

Mr.

Rocca. Because it uses identical language here,

"American male."

Mr. Goldsmith. But that doesn't mean that a cable

couldn't have been sent up earlier reporting the contact

of Oswald with the embassy on 1 Cctober.

Mr. Rocca. Well, responding to that, I can't say

that it doesn't -- of course it doesn't. But I've not seen

it. That's the roint.

My impression was that there was a shorter gap here

between the two.

Here is the ninth. I think this was on the

eighth, sent on the eighth (indicating).

Mr. Goldsmith. This was sent on the eighth, that's

correct.

This went out on the tenth. This is Titten, immediately

acting.

So, this is the first cabie, yes.

The reason that it has

taken so long is essentially

the reason that is associated with the nechanics and the

handling of mechanics.

Mr. Goldsmith. For example, would it have taken

some time to translate the tape from Russian into English?

Mr.

whole area of zeal, investigative zeal that involves simply

taking

assets that you have and attempting to make matches.

The question is one that I would address to, if he were alive,

I would address to win Scott, because it was his, this was

his particular bias at the time, and not only did he state

it

here, but he repeated it in one of the later telegrams,

even after he had been told the correct description.

Mr. Goldsmith. Scott repeated it in a later telegram.

Mr. Rocca. in a later telegram.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall when that was?

Was it pre-assassination?

Mr. Rocca. He didn't repeat the description. He

repeated the reference to it, and then he sent the photo.

light of the absence of any reference by oswald that he was

else at the Mexico City station have

selectea a photograph

of someone who was at the Embassy on 1 Octocer?

Mr

Rocca. Well, you don't raise the question as

to why they were selecting 1 october for scanning?

Mr. Goldsmith. Mell, I presume that they --

Mr. Rocca. They're using l October as a baseline, and

anything that came through that looked like an American was

a viable lead, he thought or would have thought. And this

was the only one, and he jammed it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know for a fact that this nas

the only one?

Mr. Rocca.

As far as I know it is. The rest of the

coverage shows no one else that was even an American. They

were all Latins.

MI. Goldsmith. Have you revieved the coverage?

Mr. Rocca. Only what came out during the course of

the Rockefeller thing. There were a series of photograrhs

take in front of -- what -- the Cuban Embassy, was it,

or the Cuban and. Soviet Embassies. And none of them appearea

to be Americans. I think that was what he was using as his

baseline.

But this is simoly a matter of conjecture at this

time.

In other words: it is possible.

Mir. Goldsmith. This is the photograph that had

gotten into the hands of the Secret Service: shortly after

the assassination it was sent up to Dallas from Mexico City.

Do you recall that?

Hi. Rocca. The photograph had gotten into the hands

of the FBI office in Dallas as a consequence of Mir. Scottis

feeling the afternoon that the assassination took place

that this photograph, though it had been impeached alreacy by

cable fion Whitter as not being Oswald; and he had seen

Oswald's photogrash on TV. he still

persisted in believing

that this could have had some relationship. As far as I know,

there is no reason to believe that. It simply came un in his

photographic coverage. He had the Air Attache or the Naval

Attache -- the Naval Attache -- fly it up to Dallas. And I

think the Bureau - this was sore in ccordination with the

Bureau representative in Mexico City, anc. there was a

transmission to the gureau office in Dallas. It was at that

point that the photo was taken by the Bureau and shown to

Mrs. Oswald. They cropped it in a particular way, and when

later on the picture was

shown to her, it had been cropped

in a different fashion by the Bureau office here. This was

the basis of her objection, in part, I judge, and so that

startec it.

I think the point behind it was that they should go

to the Secret service and get it, ask them for it.

Mr.

is

concerned about revealing to the Harren Commission a

sensitive source of method of operation.

I can't see that in the second paragranh,

where it says these are all things that

have been given to

them

or are recurdant, as far as the investigation is concerned.

At least at the time it seemed that way.

Mr. Goldsmith. the fact that material may have been

given to the Warren Commission

in substance is something

(a) first of all that was determined by the CIA, not by the

Warren Cormission: and secondly, if it was given in substance

and not verbatim, that reflects a desire, does it not, on

the

part of the Agency to withhold sensitive source or nethod

of operation from the Warren Commission?

Is that a fair statement?

Mr. Rocca. Well, I think this was the general

preoccupation that prevailed.

Mr: Goldsmith. So then, if there was information that

touched upon sensitive sources and methods, the Agency, in.

fact, was very concerned about it.

Mr. Rocca. It was concernec acout it, but certainly

not so concerned. that it would not either at that time give

the substance of the information or eventually give the entire

technique.

Mr. Goldsmith. Ve will return to this question in

little while, after we

obtain Mr. Rankin's letter which,

after you've seen it, I think you will realize that he was

concerned about the photographs in particular. Perhaps

Excuse me for a moment.

• (Pause)

Mr. Rocca.

With rescect to the photographs, I

recall

the Commission coming over, Slawson coming over ana

actually looking at them.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall when he did that?

Mr. Rocca. I don't remember the date of it. But he

mace a trip over and he brought somebody with him. There was

certainly more than one of them. They actually looked at it.

These were the ones that showed the background of the

gate, of the iron gate, and so forth. So there was, at that

stage anyway, certainly no question of not showing him the

actual photographic evidence so that he could examine for

himself whether or not this man was oswald and determine

whether or not it was relevant to the case.

Mr. Goldsmith. I think the record is clear that, in

fact, the larren Commission was allowed to view the photograph,

or photographs.

However, the question that I am focusing on right now

is when the Commission staff was given access to this material,

an, in fact, if that material was made promptly available.

Mr. Rocca.. Is there any record as to when they

came over? I mean, that would give at least a time, a point

of reference.

These small memoranda really reflect the kind

REPORTERS

Mr. Rocca.

This was at the point where the Commission

was

preparing for their report, and it was a question of

what should be included and what should not be.

Mr. Golasmith. Understood.

Now, from the text of this memorandum, which, although

it was prepared by Mr. Dooley, I believe it is signed by Mr.

Helms, and it's a memo to Mr..

Rankin -- from the text of this

memorandun, is it fair to say that the Agency was extremely

concerned about the sensitive nature of the photosurveillance

operation?

Mí. Rocca. Without a question. I nean, this was

a

statutory responsibility.

vir. Goldsmith. No one is questioning the legitimacy

of that concern.

I want to be very clear about that. The fact that

the

Agency was concerned about sensitive sources and methods is

not something that I am questioning the validity of.

You look puzzled. Are you?

Rocca.

All right: forget it, then. He car

talk at lunch.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now: the second paragraph of this

letter, or this memo, indicates that the agency recommends

that the photograph not be reprocuced in the conmission's

report because it would jeopardize a most confidential and

productive cheration. In addition, it could be embarrassing

to the incividual involved, who, as far as the Agecy is

aware, had no connection with lee Harvey oswald or the

assassination of President Kenneay."

Does that language suggest to you that in fact the

Agency

knew who the indivicual invoived was?

Mr. Rocca. No, no.

It simply suggests the total hypothesis that has to

be taken into account when you are dealing with anybody's

rights in a matter of this kind. I'm sure that he had no

knowledge of it. It was just a possicility.

As far as I know, that individual has never been

icentified in any fashion, nor was he ever connected in any

way with any operation of interest of any kind.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether he made more than

one visit to the Soviet Embassy?

Mr. Rocca. I cannot answer that. I don't know.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please review CIA number 179.

I think you would find examples to show that this was a

Mr. Goldsmith. Did Mexico City routinely notify

headquarters of every American whom it identified as having

been in contact with a Soviet or Cuban Embassy?

Mir. Rocca. Well, you used the word "routinely."

I can't answer on that. It did notify headquarters with

respect to Americans, as all stations do. I don't know, in

other words, what promoted Min Scott in this instance.

really information that you could probably have gotten over

But there was some cause for this, that

Mr. Goldsmith. I'm not sure that I understano that.

You say that there was some cause.

this, either on her part of on the part of the cooyist who

it is the one that I argued fairly hotly about. Again,

Mr. Goldsmith. Which list are you referring to now,

Mr. Rocca.

This is a survey of all of the materials

that had come in since the case had, since the Warren

commission had pronounced,

hac issued its report, that on the

file seemec to have possible interest to a continuing

investigatior. It's broken down into large sections. It

has had a documentary appendix in wich each telegram in crder,

each intercept was listed.

I pointed out a number of these errors at that time

and said these are the inevitable results of people working

under large stress and shot time. I remember I used this

you have to take then, with warts and all, in discussing this.

But I have no real explanation

for this. In fact, I was not

aware of it myself until fairly late.

(hereupon; at 2:30 o'clock, p.m.: the taking of the

deposition of Paymona G. Rocca continued.)

Mr. Goldsmith. I believe that this morning we

discussed the question of whether the Agency was giving the

Warren Commission the compiete information on the telephone

tap operation of the Mexico City station. I believe that

your testimony was that that information was made available

to the Commission.

Mr. Rocca. The substance, as far as I know.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was your testimony also to the

effect that the Warren Commission specifically was told about!

the telephone tap operation?

MI. Rocca. At what time? At any time during the

whole thing?

Mr. Goldsmith, Well, when, to the best of your

recollection, were they told about that?

Mir. Rocca. In my opinion: it could not have sat

very long without Mr. Dulles having told them himself as

member of the commission. I don't know the exact date that

they were informed of the materials.

It had to be very early because everyone understood

that this material was of a highly sensitive nature which

gi

had to be protected. It orinated with

a telephone tao.

You could just talk with slawson and your eyes would be

bugging out as he understood everything.

So, whether it's in January or March -- at a certain

stage certainly there was no question because they did the

actual

taps, and they were asking them here are the criginals

and stuff of that kind. Ne had to explain why there were

no originals, that they had been erased, and that kind of thing.

But as far as I know, this was not done in writing. It was

cone verbally, in conversations.

But what the exact date was I cannot rin down.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Te saw, for example, the clauson-Coleman

memo that you examined this morning which suggested that

as of 1 April, 1961 Slawson aná Coleman did not lnow of the

telephone operation: either that or they were affirmatively

misinformed about the Agency having "observed Oswald."

I would like to show you cIn number 2144.

Please ex anine this document.

(Pause)

: Mr. Rocca.. This is one of the very early pieces.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let me ask you the question and you

will get a chance to explain that.

Mr. Rocca. Well, I can't explain it, obviously.

Mr. Goldsmith. Can you identify this rocument for

the record? Simply, what is it?

Mr. Rocca. This is

an outgoing cable in the GP Floor

phase. At the time the Western Semisphere Division was

That's correct.

tays in order to protect their continuing operations.

"Will rely instead on statements of Silvia Duran!"

Mr. Rocca. As far as I'm concerned, this was not.

This was one of those early representations of sources and

methcas and their protection, which was simply unrealistic.

Mr. Rocca. As it was interpreted in those times.

I think that the interpretation has changed, probably as a

result of this episode.

Did the CIA ever obtain a tape recording of Lee

Harvey Oswald's voice?

It was erased, in other words; the telephone taps.

This was by standara order of procedure,

spot and in charge of the

operation, who are in a better position to testify to this

matter than I am.

In particular, the man who has written a book --

Mr. Goldsmith. David Phillips.

Mr. Pocca. - David Phillips. When I was working

on behalf of Mr. Belin's interest in compiling those two

papers, let me acc that the whole matter of the time lapse

did come up in my discussion with Phillips in trying to

account. for why did it take until the seventh -- aid we discuss

this this morning? I recalled at lunch that this was a

matter that I had seized on myself. And therefore, he was

division chief at that

time -- strike the therefore -- when

I talked with him in 175. I had a number of discussiors

with him on points relative to the technique that was used

in the handling of the tapes, because he was there at the time.

Now whether he was in a position to give testimony

of his own knowledge of whether it was his belief, I cannot say.

For the recore, this is a cable dated 23 November, 1963

to headquarters

from Mexico City.

paragraph?

It bears out what I

was saving earlier.

Mr. Goldsmith. The paragraph indicates in relevant

part that the station was unable to compare voice, Oswald's

voice, as the first tape had been erased prior to the receint

of the second call.

My question is as follows. Is it reasonable to infer

from

that that in fact, on November 23, 1963, one of the tapes

waS

still in existence because the author of the cable doesn't

say "station unable to compare voice as tapes have been

erased."

Rather, he indicates, "Unable to compare voice

Let me 100k ât it again. I mean, after

all, it's been a while.

Again, this goes back to the people on the spot and

what they remember, not what I feel of thing about it, though

I recognize that if I should have spotted it. I should have.

But basically the peopie engaged at the time can answer, and

their statement is that these things were scratched, tere

were removed, and they were not extant. And it was

only after the 23rd, after the assassination, you will

preserve all the material. I think that went out in a cable

that came out of headquarters.

Frankly, I think that this is again a very - my

feeling is that this is again an example of the kind of loose

language that is written and that you see on other parts of

the recorà.

MI.

Rocca. This, while it is possible that what you

say is so, my feeling is that this; in effect: says that they

were unable

to make any comparison.

Mr.

Goldsmith.

Let's review now CIA number 205, which

is a cable from Mexico City to the director, also dated

23 November:: 1953.

Would you please read paragranh number four.

(Pause)

•Mr.

Pocca. Yes.

Mr. Goidsmith. Now paragraph number four indicates

that the transcriber of the conversations

involved stated

that Oswald was identical with the person who had called

from the Cuban Enbassy to the Soviet Embassy prior to October

first.

Is it reasonable to infer from paragraph number four

on CIA number

205 that the transcriber made a voice comparison?

Mr. Bocca. Out of his heac.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Are

you indicating that --

: Mr. Rocca. And they are rood. I would have no cuestion

that he is right. But he didn't make any comparison. I dont

know him.

I don't know his talent. But that would be my

statement operationally.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, someone reading this paragraph

who does not have knowleage of Agency operating piccedures

or the manner in which transcribers operate or are trained

might, reacing this in a straightforward manner,

think that

a voice comparison had been made.

Is that correct? Are you snaking your head yes?

Mr. Rocca.

If I answer yes, this is a purely hypo-

thetical case.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that.

MI.

Rocca. As I say; it is like many other things

that occur in the record which can be interpreted hypothetically

as indicating intent or knowledge.

Mr. Golasmith. I am purposely qualifying the question

to say that if someone doesn't have any knowledge of agency

procedures or the talent and training that goes into the

making of a good transcriber, he might thing that a voice

comparison has been made from reading paragraph number four.

Do you have an explanation for this paragraph?

I think you gave one but I would like to hear it again.

MI. Rocca. Yes.

: The explanation is that this represents the typical

function of a transcriber in recalling what you would call

"eyeballing", but this is "earballing; what he hears.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, effectively,

seven weeks after

Oswald had contacted the embassy, the Cuban Embassy and the

Soviet Embassy, without having à chance to listen to the tape

and compare voices, you are indicating that the transcriber

could still have memory of that and make a valid comparison?

Mr. Rocca. Yes, and he would probably be able to do it

One of the points that I expiored, again in that thing

that I did for MI. Belin, was why there was no photographic

coverage on Friday.

Mr. Phillip told me that the machine was down on

Friday, therefore this is not right. But I don't know whether

it is or not. You see. I am in a bind here. I am telling

you what I dc know.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that.

Nevertheless, according to your answer on the record

MI. Rocca. On the record it's wrong.

Mr. Goldsmith. I didn't ask. you about the accuracy

of what the memo says. I only asked you if according to the

meno the coverage was continuous in nature. I am not asking

you whether the memo was right or wrong. I am simply asking

you whether accorcing to the meno the coverage was continucus

in nature.

Mr. Rocca. That's what the memo says.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

I will also indicate for the recora that the memo

continues to say, "However,

weather conditions and other

factors affecting any photographic efforts required of the

coverage not be considered as total or complete."

Mr. Rocca. Again, my

researches in 1975 showed

that there were large lapses and very grave difficulties

because of the operational situations that prevailed in the

Mr. Goldsmith. What was the reason that you discovered

for why the photosurveillance unit did not obtain a photcarash

of Oswald?

Mr. Rocca. Because -- I think the question was directly

raised by Mr. Belir. How come you didn't get a picture of him?

Is that correct?

ME.

Pocca. That's right, and that doesn't assume

that there might not have been some other reason for not

getting the

coverage.

Mr. Goidsmith. Now, if we were to reconstruct Oswald's

visits to the Cuban and Russian Embassies -

Mir.

Rocca. That's what I did in that memo.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mell, we're going to get a hold of that

memo; I assure you. The Agency: at this

time, for some reason:

has

not made it available to us.

But if we were to reconstruct his visits, we would

see

that he made visits not only to the soviet Embassy, but

oswald was able to visit the Embassies a total of at least

five to six times without ever being photographed?

Vir. Rocca. No, not one bit. Not one bit.

I have been in the field -- I was in the field 20

years, and anyone who trusts machines and machine coverage

is just placing his reliance on a false device.

Let me say another thing. Saturday coverage was not

undertaker. So this was another thing.

You see, there are a number of things here, there are

a number of substantive details that you don't have.

Saturday, now I recall-- and this was recorded in the

memo

-- Saturday coverage was not -- the coverage was stopped

because the embassy was closed presumably on that day.

so, it would be: generally speaking: beneficial to get

a hold of that, because i tried to go over some of these

points as jest as I could.

I must say that I don't have the

Embassy on a Saturday when the embassy was closed?

Vr. Rocca. No. All you has to do was press a button

and there was a guard, and he let you in. But inasmuch as it

was a closea day, coverage was not extended to that period.

Mr. Golasmith. If the Agency's records indicate

that by the entrance to the cubar consulate there was an

impulse camera that was activated automatically and that that

camera was in operation on September 27, which was the first

day that oswald made a visit to the Cuban Embassy, would you

think that a photograph of oswald would have been obtained?

Mr. Rocca. There are two many hypotheses.

This is

a cascade of hypotheses, and I would really: before answering

in any way that would affect your questions ic others, want

to know very, very clearly what the mechanics were, which

is something that I don't krow now.

Mr. Goldsmith. I'm not in a position by virtue of my

agreement with the Agency to go into detail with you now on

the nature of the photo coverage. So, I will withdraw the

question.

: Mr. Pocca. Again, let me say that these lapses

in coverage are absolutely a built-in part of the hazards of

the business.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was the Mexico City station ever

criticized for failing to obtain a photogrash of Oswaid?

Mr. Rocca. Not as far as I know.

Mr. Goldsmith. Critized -- was the Mexico City

station criticized?

embassies, you are not surprised by the absence of a photogragia?

the extent that it's in the oswald file.

I an not trying to

be evasive. I simply cannot rememcer what the thrust of this

information was.

My impression was that he provided the first really

significant, hard information on the DGI chief. Now his name,!

was struggling for it this morning, it must have been

("Rodriguez.")

Mr. Goldsmith. P-O-G-E-I-I-0 Lopez?

Mr. Rocca. That's the man.

As a consequence, this was of significance. But it

came in later, after, 1964 or some time. Is that correct?

Well, I'm asking you.

Mr. Goldsmith. I will show you some documents which

will refresh your memory in a moment.

Mr. Rocca. Anyway, this was considered very sensitive

and was being handled by a case officer, appropriately

equipped with AMMUG. I häd no direct cognizance of that,

for example, as I had with the Golitzin material on the Russian

side.

But I thought he came out of Paris or London

AMMUG being a DGI employee?

wrong about this.

in Mexico City. But precisely what he said with respect to

who was where in Mexico City at the time I cannot say at

this moment because I don't have it in my memory.

Just a second, now. Let me try to work it out.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Rocca, for your sake and the

purpose of refreshing your memory somewhat, I would like to

show you some CIA documents pertaining to AMMUG which, I think,

after they are reviewed, you may have a somewhat better

recollection of this particular individual.

I am going to give you CIA number 1879 and would like

to ask you to skim that through CIA 1892 -- no, CIA 1894.

That would probably take you ten minutes or so.

(Pause)

Mr. Rocca. Well, I haven't read it in detail, but

certainly I recall this.

The case officer was Swensen and

we did provide the questions that he was able to elaborate.

What can we talk about?

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there another case officer who

debriefed AMMUG?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, no. I mean,

Swensen

was the individual who was in charge.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether a CIA case

officer, whose last name was Langash or Langosh ever debriefed

Mr. Rocca..

No.

"Langash" -- I remember no such name.

Mr. Goldsmith. According to a memo dated 5 May, 1964,

CIA number 1879, the first paragraph indicates that prior

to October, 1963, Oswald visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico

City on two or three occasions. Before, during, and after

these

visits, Oswald was in contact with DGI, specifically

with Luisa Calderon, Manuel (Dega) Perez,

and Rogelio

Rodriguez Lopez.

Mr. Rocca. Who was the chief.

Mr. Goldsmith. Rodriguez was the chief?

Mr. Rocca. My recollection is that he was the chief.

That's why AMMUG gave us the first real information on the

organization of this Rezidentura.

Mr. Goldsmith. What followup was done on Oswald's

apparent contact with DGI?

Mr. Rocca.

Well, there was no followup, quite

apart from just this information. I mean, these are the

people - there was nothing to be done. Luisa Calderon

was one of the people that we had gotten a telephone tap on.

She is one of the persons who made a very peculiar comment

in the course of it, as I recall. These other people are simply

on the spot. It is not possible to get any additional

information if the station doesn't develop the assets.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did AMMUG give any information as

to

whether Silvia Duran was a DGI employee or agent?

Mr. Rocca. No. I do not know that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please refer to CIA number 1892 and

1893, starting with this paragraph (indicating). Just

read this paragraph through to here (indicating.)

Mr. Rocca. I have no comment on this.

As far as I know, there were no traces that sustain

this allegation.

document is that Calderon was or may have been connected

to the CIA.

When I say "is that correct," I'm saying is that

what the allegation is.

Mr. Rocca. Yes, that is the allegation. But this

involves almost three levels of hearsay.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

I don't want you to infer anything as to the committeel's

view on this particular issue.

Mr. Rocca. I'm not going to underwrite that at

all.

I just don't believe it.

Mr. Goldsmith. We're not asking you to underwrite it

We're simply asking you whether you have any information that

would either rebut or verify that allegation.

Mr. Rocca. I understand that. Ultimately the question

really ought to go to

the people in WH division, Mexico-Cuban,

who have the records and are in a position to verify this.

They forwarded no information bearing on such a thing.

I

assume, therefore, that the thing is not so.

Mr. Goldsmith. When you read this memo at the time that

you were working on this issue for the Rockefeller Commission,

were you concerned by the allegation that Calderon was a

CIA agent?

Mr. Rocca. No, no, no. It didn't come to my mind

at that time. I don't remember where in that memo I gave it

any attention, either.

Mr. Goldsmith. Apart now from that allegation which

not agree.

Piniero is the chief of the service.

Mr. Goldsmith. He is head of the DGI service?

Mr. Rocca. Yes. I mean, he is a very important man.

You know, this is -- we are really spinning things out

If there is no factual suppört for this, then we

conclusions that simply aren't correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. The reason that I am deposing you

today and have deposed

many other Agency employees is to attempt

to clarify questions that are raised by the record. That

perhaps gets back to one of the first points that was made

earlier in the deposition, where you made reference to the

record and I indicated that the record needs to be examined

and we can't rely exclusively upon it.

Mr.

Rocca.

She's a mysterious character anyway.

As far as I know, that has never been clarified. There

are

subsequent reports about her, as I recall, travelling

around and being set up by the DGI. So, you can just keep

that in the back of your head. You are going to have a

continual problem with her.

Mr. Goldsmith. These memos also mention that as well

Mr. Rocca. There is a whole stage of receding

mirrors that you can't really ever get to the bottom of, without

ever getting her into this kind of proceeding, settling down

and questioning her.

ME..

Goldsmith. How, CIA number 1900 is a memo

dated 5 May, 1974, which basically consists of the results

of the debriefing of AMMUG. It lists a series of questions

that were presented to AMMUG and the answers to it.

I show you that only for reference purposes now.

Mr. Rocca. My recollection is that these questions

were very carefully thought out by members of the staff,

members of my group, and that we made the thing fully available

to the Warren Commission, which is really the thing that

concerned me more than anything else.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Please listen to the question that I have for you

I just showed you a document that was dated May 5, 1964.

On May 6, 1964, according to document number 1898, some

followup questions were presented for the purpose of having

them be addressed to AMMUG. So, we have a second set of

questions.

Now, the memo dated 8 May, 1964, which is CIA number

1891, was prepared by case officer Harold F. Swensen. That

is the one I would like you to examine now in a bit more detail.

It appears that what Mr. Swensen did, unlike his earlier

report where he specifically mentioned or listed the question

that was addressed and gave AMMUG's response, here he simply

summarized the briefing session.

I am wondering if you noticed that when you examined

this document for the first time?

Furthermore, why did Mr. Swensen depart from the

earlier procedure?

Mr. Rocca. Well, it gave us relevant information.

I think that is what probably what we were primarily concerned

Frankly, I would not have held to this format.

This is the format you were referring to in the earlier question.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Yes.

MI. Rocca. The sixth of May.

Coming back on the eighth, he is giving us the results

really in capsule, I would judge, rather than setting them

down, and that would anticipate that this thing would simply

be written up more formally somewhere.

Is there such a sort of wrap-up report where the

things are?

Mr. Goldsmith. No.

Mr. Rocca. Well, this may be all he did, then, on

the thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, you don't have an explanation,

then, on the departure from the form that was given to Mr.

Swensen to address to AMMUG?

Mr. Rocca. Here again, it would be a question of

consulting with Mr. Dooley or Mr. Pratt-- I think that Mr.

Pratt had joined us by this time -- to find out exactly

what had transpired between them and Swensen - one or the

other or both -- to determine whether there was any kind of

Mr. Goldsmith. What was Swenson's position at that

time?

MI.

Rocca.

Fie was the case officer for AMMUG.

Mr.

Goldsmith.

He was simply a case officer?

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

He was handling him. Presumably

he was very keen, as the memo reflects, on keeping the man

safe and out of the public eye.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were you satisfied with the completeness

of Swenson's report?

Mr.

Rocca.

I certainly didn't raise anything at the

time. It seemed to me to tell us a lot of new information that

bore directly on the question on the Cuban side of it for the

first time, which, you remember, as I said this morning, was

a part of the whole situation there, from the CI point of

view, that I know least about. The KGB Rezidentura was clear

but what we really didn't understand was the Cuban setup.

For the first time we were beginning to get information.

But mind you, this man did not have direct information

about it.

He had heard it from people.

Mr. Goldsmith. When you say "this man", you are

referring to AMMUG?

MI. Rocca. AMMUG.

In other words, he is not a Golitzin or a Deriabin

or that kind, that is, who can tell you directly.

Mr. Goldsmith. For the record, would you indicate

who Golitzin and Deriabin were?

Mr. Rocca. These were Soviet defectors who had come out.

Derlabin is a soviet defector who defected in Vienna

in 1953-1954, and Mr. Golitzin defected in 1961. They are

KGB officers.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was all of the information contained

in the AMMUG memos prepared by Mr. Swensen given to the

Warren Commission?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, it was.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know in what form --

Warren Commission, too, if it happened. Now I am not saying

that it did happen. I have the impression, however, that

there was certainly no intent to deny the Commission full

access to the information.

• Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether the Warren Commission

was given the information that AMMUG provided with reference

to Luisa Calderon?

Mr. Rocca. I'm almost certain they had to have it

because there was an intercept on it, and this bound down one

aspect of the intercept, which was a very peculiar phrase that

she used -- "He got what he deserved" -- or something like

that.

that the information went to the Warren Commission?

Mr. Goldsmith. I am going to show you now what the

Agency has indicated to us was made available to the Warren

Commission.

In response to your question, there is no particular

memo from Mr. Dooley indicating what went to the Warren

Commission.

This is a document that was made available to Mr.

had been provided to the Agency by AMMuG.

I would like you to review the document and then

specifically to review the actual information that was

made available to the Warren Commission.

MI. Rocca. Do you mean that Mr. Rankin is not a member

of the Warren Commission?

Mr. Goldsmith. I didn't mean to differentiate between

Mr. Rankin and the Warren Commission.

Basically, what I was saying is that the document

number 1929-1930 is the memorandum, the transmittal memorandum;

that indicates what information is going to be provided,

and the

source of the information. And then, what you'll see in pages

CIA number 1932 and 1933 is the actual information that was

made available.

Have you had a chance to review

But, as I say, I cannot explain -- Mr. Hall, who did

accept that that material did not get to the Commission

somehow in some way.

My question pertains to this document

right now.

Let's identify it first.

would you identify for the record what this is?

Mr. Rocca. It's an internal memorandum from Mr.

Angleton to me indicating that the DDP, Mr. Helms, has been

scheduled to go before the Commission and he wants a short,

but comprehensive, memorandum which highlights the basic

issues or positions entered into by the Agency and its dealings

with the Commissions.

In other words, that's presumably what came out of it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, this is dated 12 May, 1964,

That is correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. The memo for you from Mr. Angleton

is dated 12 May, 1964.

Mr.

Rocca.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say from the text of this

memo that the Agency was extremely concerned about the

sensitive source, AMMUG? In other words, here was an example

of the Agency being concerned about a sensitive source?

Mr. Rocca. Well, there is always this sensitivity.

Mr. Goldsmith. I'm asking you to look only at CIA 1905.

Mr. Rocca. But you've already shown me the brief.

That's what I was looking at.

Mr. Goldsmith. Okay. You'd like to look through

the brief again?

: Mr. Rocca. No.

I was only going to point out that the very first

paragraph of the brief refers to the sensitive source, which

is AMMUG -- somewhere along here -- it's one of the tabs,

Tab E, I quess.

So, there was within the limits of the prescription

comprehensive and at the same time extensive information,

Mexican

and Cuban phases.

In other words, is the point that

we weren't mentioning it -- because we did mention it?

Mr. Goldsmith. There are a variety of points and I

really am not able to indicate to you right now what all the

My concern here with document number 1906 simply is

whether the Agency was concerned about the sensitivity of

source.

Mr. Goldsmith. The AMMUG defection was no greater

than anything else that was coming along?

Mr. Rocca. Than any of the other techniques, sources,

and methods that we had been concerned with.

In other words, I'm trying to - you were asking me

whether this qualitatively was of greater significance than

anything else that we were engaged in protecting, and I can't

remember that it was.

Mr. Swensen considered it as very important from the

standpoint of his own security

and the security of

his agent.

But I don't recall any draconian impositions, "Don't say anything

about AMMUG."

Mr. Goldsmith. What did Mr. Angleton have in mind

when he said the following to you in the memo: "I informed

him" -- that is, Mr. Helms - "that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission; that it

should not go to the Commission prior to the Director's

or made sure that the Director is fully aware of its implications

since it could well serve as the basis for detailed questioning."

was involved in that.

Mr. Rocca..

I mean, it doesn't bring to mind a par-

ticular series of considerations unless they would relate

directly to the handling of the individual, who he was, what

position he had, and all the rest - in other words, involve

the actual surfacing of the source.

Mr. Goldsmith. According to this memo, it also

indicates that the DDP, Mr. Helms, stated that he would review

this carefully and make a decision as to the question of timing.

Was the Agency concerned about the question of timing

in terms of when material would be made available to the

Warren Commission?

Mr.

Rocca.

I think it refers to timing with respect

to this particular matter, in view of the fact that AMMUG

had just come out.

Overall I would say that they were not concerned with

the question of timing.

what the subject matter of CIA number 1950 to 1954 is?

In other words, you've just reviewed several pages.

They've pertained to Luisa Calderon.

What is the nature of the relevance of Luisa Calderoni

to this

case?

Mr. Rocca. The relevance is that if she is a DGI

agent, then the intercept becomes important. But this was

not something that I recognized in 1963. I recognized it

in 1975, because at that time I read the whole case.

Mr. Goldsmith. For purposes of clarification, what

is the substance of the telephone intercept that you are

referring to?

What does Luisa Calderon say?

Mr. Rocca. She doesn't say a thing. That's why it

is totally nuance, and I would never go public on a matter

of this kind.

Mr. Goldsmith. What is the nuance to which you are

referring?

Mr. Rocca. The nuance is that she is -- she phrases

what possibly had happened to Kennedy as "what barbarians."

I mean, it indicates an emotional setup, an emotional

attitude toward what had happened.

Mr. Goldsmith. More fundamentally, doesn't her

statement suggest the possibility of foreknowledge on her

part?

Mr. Rocca. I used the word. I used that word and

you used it just now. But I'm not going to go into a court

and say that it does because I have no evidence that that

indicates foreknowledge. In and of itself it could indicate

anything, because we don't know enough from the intercept

about it. That's why I said

this was nuance.

Mr. Goldsmith. Right.

Now, at first glance, on reading that transcription,

it would not necessarily take on any particular significance

standing alone. I believe the way you refer to it is possibly

boastful self-indulgence or hyperbole, on the part of an

individual.

However, does it not to you take on added significance

in light of Luisa Calderon's alleged connection with DGI?

Mr. Rocca.

If we could prove it. All the evidence

is against it.

Piniero denies it.

Mr. Goldsmith. No, no, no.

Piniero denies that she was CIA. He does not deny

that she was DGI.

We can refer back to that memo if you would like

to clarify that.

Mr. Rocca. No. I think you're right, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Well, you're at the very point I was, to be utterly

frank with you, in compiling that memo.

Mr. Goldsmith. The point I am trying to make is

if she were DGI, that statement would take on added

significance.

Is that a fair statement?

Mr. Rocca. That was the reason I put it in. But I

would, in any event, make it a cause

for state intervention

or that kind of thing. It's another one of these things --

it's what I call the laboratory level of counter intelligence,

where you consider evidence,

really, the way you consider

it, say, at a moot court, in a law school, that kind of thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was the Warren Commission ever given

a transcription of the conversation involving Luisa --

Mr. Rocca. Without question I would say that.

Without question.

They had the Calderon followup. They had the Dorticos

followup. They had the whole works. Not only did they have

it here, but they had it also

when they were down at the

station.

Mr. Goldsmith. It is just one page.

Mr. Rocca. The fact that there is no reference to

Calderon doesn't mean that there was no transmission. It

means that this simply covered other materials.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would there be another record of the

Calderon transcription having been given to the warren

commission, and if so, where would it be?

Mr. Rocca. It has to be in this very record. This

is the first I have heard which even suggested that the

Calderon intercept had not been passed on.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let me just go back and review this

Mr. Rocca. As I say, this is not an exclusionary

document.

This is CIA document number 1928. This document is

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the Mexico City station make

the Calderon transcript, at least according to this memo,

available to the Warren Commission?

Mr. Rocca. I can't say that, not from this memo.

It doesn't state that.

Mr. Goldsmith. The memo makes no reference at all

to Calderon, is that correct?

Mr. Rocca. It does not.

That does not affect the Commission's knowledge because

it simply doesn't make any sense that they wouldn't know of

the Calderon aspect, in my opinion, at this stage.

Mr. Goldsmith. Where would we be able to find a

formal record of the transcriptions that had been made

available to the Warren Commission staff?

Mr. Rocca. They should be in the formal record of the

material transmitted to the Warren Commission and in their

own records ana logs.

arrested?

Mr. Rocca. Because of the implications of her

involvement, possible involvement, as a consequence of the

intercept, I would assume. It's 27 November. The intercept

had taken place on the 23rd, the afternoon of the 23rd.

The Dorticos thing had been on the 24th or the 25th. So, the

only basis that they would have had for any such action

would have been those materials. They had them in the field.!

Mr. Goldsmith. What about Azcue?

Mr. Rocca. He was presumably present and had the

is the way I would have interpreted it.

So, they are all related -- in other words, co-related,

in the documentary materials which had been assembled by

with the allegations that were made after the assassination

the Nicaraguan named Alverado?

Mr. Rocca. It's one of the cases that I wrote up in

the memorandum I think I gave to Belin.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you summarize generally for the

record what the allegation was?

Mr. Rocca.. I think my summary probably wouldn't be

worth the paper it's written on.

But, in essence, Alverado walked in the Embassy on

Christmas. Day of something and said that he had been in the

Cuban Embassy of in the courtyard and had seen a red-headed

Negro pass money to a young man he identified or who in his

view was Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

The gist of the allegation was essentially that

Alverado saw --

Mr. Rocca. The money was $5,000 or something.

Mr. Goldsmith. -- a Cuban, a red-headed Latin American

pass money to Oswald at the Cuban Consulate and that there

was some discussion which could have pertained to a possible

assassination.

Does that strike you as a fair summary of the gist

of the allegation, without going. through the entire record?

Mr. Rocca. Well, yes.

He was discredited, of course, as a source, eventually,

or April.

I cannot recall exactly when, but they are a part

of the record, certainly.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were the allegations by Alverado

as the best thing since Pepsi Cola until that happened.

And then it just went down the drain.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let me give you a document, CIA number

Mr. Goldsmith. According to that polygraph result,

Alverado did not pass the polygraph, and after being told

that he did not pass the exam, he essentially said, "The

machine doesn't lie."

Is that a fair statement?

Mr. Rocca. That's correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say or appropriate

to say that based upon that, the Alverado allegation had been

resolved, so far as the Agency was concerned -- if you know?

MI. Rocca. I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. At the time that you were involved in

the Agency's investigation for the Warren Commission, at the

time that you were involved in providing information to the

Warren Commission for the Agency, was the Alverado issue

still a live one?

MI. Rocca. I believe so -- and it continued alive

until sometime after this date. That is my recollection.

That is, into

January of 1964.

I can't account for this thing here (indicating)

because it is definitive, and that time lapse that I recall.

But it certainly continued and there were people on the

Commission who were interested in the Alverado who were

dealing with people in Mr. Whitten's group on the details

of the case, is my recollection, and continued.

Mr. Goldsmith. So,

to pass the polygraph prior to December 10, the issue was

still a live one at the time you became involved in the

investigation?

Mr. Rocca. It was still being mooted, yes, discussed.

It was still being discussed.

I would say that it had come to its end, though,

sometime around the end of January, or

that time. But these

are just terribly impressionistic judgments.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Fine.

I believe you discussed this this morning, but again,

for my purposes, when did you become involved in the CIA's

relationship with the Warren Commission?

Mr. Rocca. On of about the twelfth of January,

from that point on.

You get

the evidence of it, I think,

by the 31st, very clearly.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now,

in CIA number 2100, it indicates

that he, Alverado, stated that he wanted to protest his

unjust treatment and the fact that he was given money, since

he does not believe in negotiating over death.

Do you know anything about this allegation --

Mr. Rocca. I do not.

been referring to that kind of termination pay that is

normal or whatever.

But, as I say, this is my first reading of it and

I cannot comment to it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, were you told in 1963 that

Alverado had made a statement about being offered money?

The interesting thing -- if we're finished with that

So, if you believe in stream of consciousness in

the way things happen, here they go. • But my explanation for

that is that she read it in the Warren Commission report

of in some of the newspaper coverage, and that's the way it

came out.

But I still took note of it in the memo that I put

together for Belin as to those elements that suggested

nuance, because she was very persistent in repeating her

story. But she also happened to be a personal

enemy of one

of the other people involved.

Mr. Goldsmith. Silvia Duran?

Mr. Rocca. Silvia Duran. So, there is a question

of conflict of interest.

But there were people in the embassy who believed

her and continued to report, and there is at least one

Mr. Goldsmith. --CIA number 1983, which is dated

April. 15, 1964.

It's a memo to Mr. Rankin from Mr. Coleman and Slawson

in reference to progress in their area, which was Oswald's

foreign travels. Specifically, on page: 6 of that memo, on

paragraph number 7, it indicates that the Warren Commission

at that point had not yet been given a complete report of

the Alverado story from the CIA.

I wonder if you could respond to that?

Mr. Rocca. This is following their trip there

and undoubtedly reflects their conversation on the spot.

I think their note that we 'know informally and through

highly digested written reports that the allegations have

been thoroughly investigated in estabiishing beyond a

reasonable doubt as false" has really taken care of it.

It could be a matter of the Minsk business.

Commission, it is conceivable that the Commission would have

wanted to examine that point further.

Are you familiar with the allegations that were made

by a Mexican citizen named Gutierez?

Mr. Rocca. You would have to tell me more about

Gutierez, because I don't recognize it from that name,

though it may again be one of the things that I took up.

Mr. Goldsmith. Gutierez was the Mexican citizen who

said that he saw an individual whom he later recognized to

be Oswald leaving the Cuban Consulate with another individual

and that the individuals were discussing something sinister.

Gutierez may have further alleged that he saw

money change

hands as well.

Please read number 1979, which will adequately refresh

your recollection, I think, on his statement.

: Mr.

Rocca. Oh, this is the famous "observed in

Mr. Rocca. I would simply have to restudy the

whole thing. It just doesn't register with me. I mean,

I would have to go over the report. I think this is another

matter that they did discuss, the Gutierez lead.

the FBI line. It certainly doesn't ring any bell to me.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Essentially, to refresh your memory,

Gutierez alleged that he saw Oswald and someone else leaving

the Cuban Consulate, that the individuals got off in a car,

took off in a car. He overhead a conversation that was, at

least to him, sinister in nature and made an allegation that

a payoff was supposed to have occurred; possibly in that car

Does that -

Mr. Rocca. This is something that, as I say, I have

no recollection of,

and my feeling is that the Bureau did

whatever was followed up.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why would the Bureau have investigated

this matter as opposed to the CIA?

Mr. Rocca.

Their jurisdictional authorities, I mean,

were de facto in Mexico and they ran over everything.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the Bureau investigate Alverado?

There, it seems, that the Agency was responsible

for resolving that issue.

Mr. Rocca. That might have been some kind of local,

private treaty.

But de Paz, for example, they did the

initial work and discredited her as a source.

It was we,

that is, Win and the Embassy man, who continued the interest

in it, with the Bureau's knowledge.

But my feeling is that they would not have accepted

our investigation in a matter of that kind. They would have

gone over it themselves, and they dia. They spent hundreds

and hundreds of hours just going around Mexico City checking

up on Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, your impression, then, is that

the Bureau, rather than the Agency, investigated this issue?

Mr. Rocca. Could have. I mean, I'm trying to explain

why I don't remember anything about it. That certainly

doesn't strike a bell.

Now, it may strike a bell with whitten or somebody

else that actually was vested with this area.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the Agency ever attempt to

determine whether it had obtained a photograph of Gutierez

outside the Cuban Consulate or Embassy?

Mr. Rocca. I cannot respond to that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether Gutierez was

ever polygraphed?

: Mr. Rocca. No, I do not.

You see, I draw a complete blank on this one.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Fine.

If you don't remember, I'm not going to press you

on it, Mr. Rocca. We are certainly not here to attempt

Mr. Rocca. It is a cable to the intelligence, the

counter intelligence community -- White House, Department

of State, and the FBI from the Agency on Oswald on the

26th of November, stipulating of setting forth information

from Mexico regarding an alleged relationship between Oswald

and Arnesto Rodriguez, who lives in New Orleans -- Arnesto

Rodriguez -- and runs a Spanish language school, and is

anti-Castro.

Mr. Goldsmith. Does the cable

also make reference

to a tape recording?

Mr. Rocca. According to Maria Rodriguez de Lopez,

her son-in-law has a taped conversation

1 with Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Do you know whether this allegation,

either of Oswald's connection with Arnesto Rodriguez or

the fact of a possible tape recording was ever investigated

by the Agency?

Mr. Rocca. No -- and it would not have been.

Mr. Goldsmith. The reason for that would have been

This is strictly within the investigative

This is not a matter -- in other words, this cable,

background information. I don't know, therefore, whether

this was investigated.

summary that I gave for Mr. Belin. But not having it at

this moment, it was

she who came in around Christmas Day,

not Alverado.

after the assassination.

Mr. Rocca. So, I correct that part. It was she.

She had become involved -- she is a highly

controversial right wing personality, (a poet), and had

become involved in a situation with the secretary or the

receptionist at the Cuban Embassy.

Mr. Goldsmith. Silvia Duran?

Mr. Rocca. Silvia Duran -- was a relative.

They were hostile to each other. There was a long,

apparently, background to that effect.

But she came in with a story which concerned

essentially the passage of money by a red-headed Negro at

the Cuban Embassy. But I cannot recall what her evidential-

what the crux of her evidence was in this.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall whether she was referring

to having seen this red-headed Negro at the Cuban Embassy

or rather at a party that was being thrown by Horatio

Duran?

thing, reading the file in connection with Mr. Belin's

request -- that Mr. Scott pursued it very thoroughly.

Mrs. de Paz went to the Embassy around Christmas Day.

Do you recall what year that was?

Mr. Rocca. Oh, yes.

It was the end of '63, early '64. And, if it wasn't

Christmas Day, it was New Year's Day or the weekend, because

there was -- her story was that her life was in danger.

She had reported her information to the Minister of Interior

or to the Gobernacion. They had put her up in a hotel.

I mean, there was an entire scenario which she read.

There were very few probative and evidential details to

sustain her story.

According to the record,

as I remember it, the FBI

representative regarded it as simply not so.

Mir. Goldsmith. Do you know whether she was given a

polygraph?

Mr. Rocca. No, I don't think she ever -- I remember

nothing in the record that shows that she was polygraphed.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why she was not polygraphed

whereas Alverado was polygraphed?

Mr. Rocca. Was she?

Mr. Goldsmith. I'll rephrase the question.

Do you know why she would not have been polygraphed

when someone such as Alverado was polygraphed?

MI. Rocca. No, I can't answer that.

who were making the operational decisions on the spot. I

can guess that her story was simply not believed or there

was sufficient disbelief not to warrant that extent of

imposition on her personality.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are you certain that Elena Garro de

of 1964?

Ah.

Of course. It was the next year that she walked in.

It was the end of '64 or the beginning of '65. I recall

now that this gives the link, because the Warren Commission

had already issued its report which had mentioned the

red-headed Negro and the lead, and therefore in reading her

story, there always occurred the virus that she had simply

taken advantage of an evidential detail which was already

in the public domain.

This is now my recollection.

This is after the Warren Commission had completed

its work.

the case, retrospectively, as one of those elements

that had happened after the Warren Commission had looked

after this, that suggested the possibility of Cuban involvement

or that something further could be and should be done about

the Cuban aspect, should be undertaken.

Mr. Goldsmith. That document makes reference to an

individual named Carvillo, who allegedly detained Elena Garro

de Paz at the Vermont Hotel in Mexico.

Do you know whether Carvillo ever had any connection

with the CIA?

This is what has been alleged in the

As far as I know, there is no investigative

substratum for that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether anyone ever

approached Carvillo and asked him--

Mr. Rocca. No, I do not.

Mr. Goldsmith. -- why he detained Elena Garro de

Paz?

Mr. Rocca. No, I do not.

Certainly that part of it entered into the period

of '63, if she was telling the truth. Of course, we don't

know whether she is telling the truth because she told her

story for the first time, as far as the record is concerned,

in '64, at the end of the year.

For that reason I inserted this into the record of

episodes that struck me as being at least interesting from

the standpoint of re-reviewing the file, from the Cuban

point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please refer to CIA number 2055.

this number (indicating)?

I believe yesterday we finished the session with a

brief discussion of whether there was an intelligence training

school in the city of Minsk, and you indicated that in 1963

there was no reliable information indicating that, in fact,

there was such a school in Minsk.

Do you have any other information that pertains

to that point?

Mr. Rocca. I think you have summarized exactly

what I said, that there was no confirmation available

that there had been or was during the time that Oswald was

in Minsk a training

school of the service in that city.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever receive any indication

subsequent to 1964 that, in fact, there was no such school

in Minsk?

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, there has never been

any confirmation or indication.

Commission was given all of the information that was available

on that point -

Mr. Rocca. Yes, indeed.

Mr. Goldsmith. -- and there has not been any additional

information since 1964 that touches upon it?

Mr. Rocca. That's correct.

Mr. Goldsmith. Turning to another area, now, would

you indicate for the record what a 201 file is?

Mr. Rocca: A 201 file is a jargon expression that

grew up, I suppose, out of the old army system, 201 files in

World War II. It was applied when our files, CIA files,

were set up in 1947. I am speaking now out of hearsay.

The phrase applies to files created on personalities, for

dossiers on personalities. They are referred to, in other

words, broadly speaking, as 201 files.

Mr. Goldsmith.

So, a 201 file essentially is a

personality file?

Mr. Rocca. (Nods affirmatively.)

Mr. Goldsmith. Does a 201 file contain information

of operational significance?

Mr. Rocca. Yes, it can. It depends on how the

material has been selected and put together.

Mr. Goldsmith. What is the criterion for the opening

of a 201 file?

Mr. Rocca. These are specified exactly in a handbook

which is written and to which I refer you. The criteria

have changed, or were changed, over the years, at the beginning

to apply to individuals who were either agents or suspect

agents of adversary services, all adversary services,

intelligence, counter intelligence, sabotage interest,

our own agents, collaborators, and others, at the determination,

again in terms of criteria, who fell within the mission of

the Agency.

These categories are specified and I refer you, then,

to that publication. It's at the Records Integration Center.

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you had occasion to open a

201 file?

: Mr. Rocca. Personally?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Mr. Rocca. No.

I always would indicate this and have other people

do it. As far as I know, I have not ever done the process,

except perhaps as a part at one point of my formal training

or other. But I have no recollection of having opened a file:

primary purpose of such an opening be to obtain information on

a person who was of potential counter intelligence significance?

Mr. Rocca. It could be that.

It could be of purely passive interest. It is to

serve as a repository for the accession of additional informatior

of whatever kind, overt, covert, or whatever.

So, it does not necessarily indicate any kind of

aggressive interest at all.

It simply serves as the receptacle or repository

for the retention of information, and recovery of information.

Mr. Goldsmith. If an individual is perceived as a

counter intelligence threat, would a 201 file normally be

opened?

14

18

20

23

24

23

DocId: 32263409

Page 203

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

At the time that the file was opened on Mr. Oswald,

which would be 1958 or 1959, my impression is that U.s.

defectors were not in the list of individuals on whom files

would be opened automatically by the Records Integration

Division, which actually could do this and did it as a

matter of formal duty.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, there are categories, categories

of individuals, which automatically result in the opening

of a 201 file, whereas in some cases you are saying that

the opening of a file is discretionary.

Is that accurate?

Well, according to the handbook it would

Mr. Goldsmith.

That document indicates in

substance, does it not, that Lee Harvey Oswald appeared at

Embassy in Russia to renounce his American

citizenship? It indicates that he had applied for Soviet

citizenship. It indicates,

among other things, that his

attitude was

arrogant, aggressive, he had recently been

discharged

from the Marine Corps, and it says he has offered

Department telegram, which was routed to the CIA and which

we have obtained from the Office of Security at the CIA --

would the information contained in this telegram normally

lead to the opening of a 201 file?

Mr. Rocca. It depends on where it went in the Agency.

If it went to the Office of Security, they would have opened

their own file on it. But if a copy did not go to the DDP

at that time, the Deputy Director for Plans, there would be

no way of knowing about it.

So, I cannot respond.

But normally, that would have been actionable,

I would say retrospectively. And I have no knowledge whether

or not it ever did come into our hands at that time.

Mr. Goldsmith. Right.

We will get into that momentarily.

Mr. Rocca. As a matter of fact, I think the substance

of this cable was reported in the newspapers.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is there any formal communication

channel between the Office of Security and DDP which would

serve the purpose of having communications of this kind

be passed to the appropriate office for action?

Mr. Rocca. Not necessarily. There obviously should

be.

But if the people in the Office of Security will receive

this, inasmuch as it concerns an American, and it was

presumably relevant to their interest in Americans, and possible

security interests from the defensive security point of view

of CIA itself, they might not do it, in which case the

normal liaison, which would be via a liaison officer

or simply a routing slip from the chief of the Office of

Security would not take place.

Mr. Goldsmith. More specifically, then, is there

any link between the Office of Security and the CI staff

which would serve the purpose of passing information of this

kind to the CI staff, as it would seem that the information

contained in this memo is relevant to the CI staff in

particular, rather than any of the divisions within DDP?

Mr. Rocca. Well, you are again looking at it with

20-20 hindsight. There certainly were all the channels

that one could expect in an organization, as. I indicated

on the chart yesterday, for the passages of such a piece

of material. In point of fact, State should have routed

it to the DDP.

It is in that kind of routing and selection that you

could get slippage.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, if I understand your testimony,

it is that, in fact, there was a communication channel

between Office of Security and CI staff which would serve the

purpose of passing along this type of information. whether

or not the information in fact was passed along is another

question. But there was a channel.

MI. Rocca. Oh, indeed.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like you to review a document

that is known as Warren Commission Exhibit 917.

I might note for the record that at the bottom of the

exhibit there is an indication that the document was routed

to the CIA, although there is no indication specifically

which office at CIA received this document.

Warren Commission Exhibit 917, for the record, is a

confidential message from the Navy to the Chief of Naval

Operations.

(Pause)

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you had a chance to review that

document?

Mr. Rocca. Yes, indeed.

Mr. Goldsmith. We just might note for the record

that this document is somewhat briefer than the earlier

one you just reviewed, the State Department cable dated

10-31-59.

This one also states that Oswald was in the

Marine Corps as a radar operator and has offered to furnish

the Soviets information he possesses in U.S. radar.

Again, would the information contained in this type

of communication normally lead to the opening of a 201 file?

Mr. Rocca. In the DDP. At that time, as I say,

it was not automatic.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand. Your testimony is

very clear on that. It would have been something

Mr. Rocca.

Yes.

Defectors was added as a mandatory category as a

consequence of this whole case.

Mr. Goldsmith. I might point out that --

MI. Rocca. So, if I were reviewing this thing and

it had come across my desk, I would certainly expect it to

go to a 201 file.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

MI. Rocca. But there would be other 201 files,

or other files, that ought to receive it, too, including

the Office of Security.

Mr. Goldsmith. What is CITSIG?

Mr. Rocca.

CI/SIG is Counter Intelligence, Special

Investigations Group.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what the purpose of that

group was in 1959 to 1960?

Mr. Rocca. Well, this group was set up originally

when the staff was set up and before I joined it. So, are you

limiting your question only to that time or to its general

functions?

Mr. Goldsmith. My question was focusing on the period

1959 to 1960.

Mr. Rocca. The point is that it was set up to handle

especially sensitive cases in the area of security of personnel

and in particular, cases involving security of personnel

who were also of operational interest, as were operators.

In other words, it was an interface with the Office

of security.

Mr. Goldsmith. In other words, when you say

security of personnel, you are referring now to CIA --

Mr. Rocca. DDP personnel, and Agency personnel to

the extent that they might affect the DDP's interests.

This was the channel to the Office of Security.

MI. Goldsmith. So, is it fair to say here that the

purpose of the CI/SIG unit was to insure that DDP was not

being penetrated by a foreign intelligence service?

Mr. Rocca. That, I think, would probably be one of the

sensitive kinds of cases that they would be interested in.

Mr. Goldsmith. What other types of sensitive types

of cases would they be interested in?

MI. Rocca. I think they would probably have been

interested in any kind of case involving security of DDP

personnel, or operations like the LINGUAL operation, which

was placed within its purview. That involved, in other

words, sensitive work against the Soviets designed to

produce information, again bearing chiefly on the security

of personnel and of operations.

Mr. Goldsmith. When would someone within the

CI/SIG unit have occasion to open a 201 file?

Mr. Rocca. I would imagine that they would have had

that occasion whenever a question a rose that concerned

people that came within the purview of the mission that I

have described, namely, the pepetration of our operations

or the advancement of our particular interests with respect

to the security of those operations. These now become very

difficult questions to answer without some thought, because

I would have to think of, really, general trains of operations,

and in that area I was not, of course, briefed. But I think

in substance what I have said covers what I know about it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Okay.

You just made a reference to --

MI. Rocca. I mean, there were many sensitive areas

that involved aspects, that involved sources and access to

materials that were of higher classification than what you

have shown me.

Mr. Goldsmith. You just made reference to having

been briefed.

Would you clarify for the record what you mean by

having been briefed.

Mr. Rocca. Did I say -- I did not say that.

Mr. Goldsmith. I think that you did, and what I

suspect you referred to was during your time in the Agency

things that you may have been briefed upon.

MI. Rocca. Oh, yes. I mean, I was not briefed

on the entire range of their operations.

Mr. Goldsmith. You were not briefed by the Agency

for this deposition, were you?

MI. Rocca. I was not.

Mr. Goldsmith. You weren't briefed by anyone of the

staff prior to taking the deposition?

MI. Rocca. Indeed not. I have had no contacts

whatsoever about this.

MI. Goldsmith.

Fine.

I just wanted to clarify that.

(Pause)

MI. Rocca. The specific purpose that lay behind

the creation of this office I think grew out of the penetrations

of OSS by the Soviets.

Mr. Goldsmith. Okay.

Getting back to the concept of a 201 file, will a

201 file always indicate whether the individual involved

had a relationship of some kind with the Agency, either as

an agent, a source, a contract employee, whatever? By looking

at a 201 file, will you always know whether, in fact, the

person had a relationship with the Agency?

MI. Rocca. One of the categories for opening a file,

for opening a 201 file, was the contractual or fiduciary

CONFIDENTIAL

relationship, and if that was the case, if the file had

been opened in that instance, it would either be manifest' in

the file or there would be an indication in it directing

whoever had the file to go to whatever place had the

responsibility for the fiduciary relationship.

Now, as I stated, this is only one category in the

list of criteria for the opening of files, and as far as I

know, the 201 file that was opened on Oswald was opened by

Mrs. Edgerter pursuant not to that, but to the potential

interest that she, as an analyst, felt lodged in the fact

that he had been a defector and it figured on that list.

Mr. Goldsmith. I think that you are anticipating

my questions, and we will get to the Oswald 201 file in

particular momentarily.

Let's get back to the question that I asked a moment

ago.

ITH STREET,

18

Will the 201 file always indicate the fact of a

relationship with the CIA, if there was such a relationship?

Mr. Rocca. As far

as

I know, it would.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, if someone were an agent, source,

30

21

22

or --

Mr. Rocca. The whole purpose of the file, and the

opening of that file, would be to prevent others from recruiting

the same agent, from making use of the same agent, for

other agencies who perhaps had been in contact to do that,

and therefore it would have to appear in some way or other

on the face of the file.

MI. Goldsmith. Then the next step in the analysis

is the following one.

From the absence of any indication in the file,

in the 201 file, that someone had a relationship with the

Agency, either as an asset, agent, source, contract employee,

whatever - from the absence of such an indication, can one

safely infer that, in fact, there was no such relationship?

MI: Rocca. I would say so, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are documents

ever removed from

201 files?

Mr. Rocca. They should not be removed from the

files.

That was, of course, part of the standard order of

procedure.

The fact is, however, the file itself passed through

many hands in the course of dealing with it, and it would be

technically possible to do so.

I cannot deny this. I mean, this is something that

exists on the face, as I see it.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, in theory, no documents should be

removed from a 201 file, but it is possible to remove

documents from a 201 file?

MI. Rocca. Well, it could have been -- it could have

been done.

Mr. Goldsmith. When someone removes a document from

a 201 file, is it required to indicate on the file that a

document has been removed?

MI. Rocca. Well, of course -- and the purpose, and

it would have to be signed for.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

MI. Rocca. Now this is the advantage of using the

machine.

Mr. Goldsmith. Which machine are you referring to,

Mr. Rocca. The computer serves to give a permanent

record to a title, and the removal of that title cannot take

place without creating a record, and therefore it is always

traceable. This represented, therefore, as these questions

were being discussed during the '50's, the answer to either

arbitrary or inadvertent removal. At least it always seemed

to be that way and a lot of other people agreed.

(Pause)

Mr. Rocca. Let me say, in addition, on that point

that the system employed, as I

recall it, a numbering device

which worked from the

first paper, which was number one, up,

so that any paper that had been removed lower than the top

paper would, unless it had been replaced by another, or if

the entire numbering system had not been altered, have appeared

immediately as absent. This was the device for internal

control that functioned during the first years of the system.

Mr. Goldsmith. Normally, in a 201 file, are the

documents filed chronologically? By that, I mean the earliest

document, the first document to go into the file, which might

be the field personality file request form that led to the

opening of the file, that would be the first document, and

then the next document in time would go immediately on top

of it, and so on, so that effectively documents are in the

file in the same sequence in which they were made available

to the file.

Mr. Rocca. But the 201 would not be the repository

for a personal history questionnaire: and that kind of thing;

that is, the key documents in establishing a fiduciary

relationship would not be in the 201. They would be in a

separate file held by the desk and whoever was handling the

individual.-

MI. Goldsmith. That's a separate question.

Aside from that, however, would the documents normally

go into the file in chronological order?

MI. Rocca. Let me assure you, Mr. Goldsmith, that

there are people who are far better informed on

this topic

than I am, and therefore whatever I say should be taken cum

grano sale, as they say, with a grain of salt.

Mr. Goldsmith. Normally in a 201 file, will the

documents be filed sequentially?

Mr. Rocca. And I want that to be very well

understood. The whole matter of records, in other words, is

a matter for which people are paid very high salaries, and

they have been in charge in this area from the very beginning.

But changes and modifications to the system have taken place.

But I would defer to their statements with respect to a

number of the questions that you have asked.

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you had occasion to review

any 201 files?

Mr. Rocca. Yes, I've read many, many of them.

Mr. Goldsmith. Hundreds of them?

MI. Rocca. Not hundreds, I would say. I can't --

a figure like that -- but I have read many of them.

: Mr. Goldsmith. To the best of your recollection,

did the files that you read contain their documents in the

chronological order in which the documents arrived? In

other words, I am asking you to respond to the question that

I raised earlier.

As a matter of routine, are the documents filed in

the 201 file in sequential or chronological order, so that the

earliest document would be on the bottom and the last document

would be on top?

Mr. Goldsmith. Now you mentioned the PRe's, the

personal record questionnaires. You indicated that they

would not be in the 201 file.

Where, to your knowledge, would they be located?

MI. Rocca. They would be located in particular files!

held by the desk responsible for the agent.

MI. Goldsnith. would they be located in an operations

or projects file?

Mr. Rocca. I think that probably is the correct

term, yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Please examine CIA number 788, which

is the field personality file request form that was used in

the case of Mr. Oswald.

I think you had occasion to review that yesterday.

(Pause)

: Mr. Rocca. I see nothing different here from what

I saw yesterday.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

I hope that you don't see anything different from what

you saw yesterday since it's been in the safe all evening.

According to that document, when was a 201 file opened

for Lee Oswald?

Mr. Rocca. Nine December, 1960, is the date for

the request.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Is there anything unusual about the Oswald 201 file

being opened over a year after the Agency was initially

informed of Oswald's defection and the fact that he was

alleged to have offered information to the Soviets?

Mr. Rocca. I find that not unusual in view of the

flow of work and the pressure of work. I couldn't explain

that gap in terms of anything, except just the normal flow

of business, in view of what I know about the opening of it.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, you think the normal flow of

business might account for a delay of over a year?

Mr. Rocca. Well, it depends on what was the date of

the material that we got from State.

Mr. Goldsmith. Rather than reviewing all that now,

I will just indicate that the material from State started to

arrive in late October or early November of 1960.

: Mr. Rocca. So, the flow is correct, I would say,

in terms of what was going on. There was an obvious interest

in this kind of material.

Mrs. Edgerter exercised an analyst's choice in

opening the file.

I think there is nothing in the time lapse that

would indicate anything, except the flow of work.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now Mrs. Edgerter was a member of

the CI/SIG unit, is that correct?

MI. Rocca. Yes, indeed.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it unusual for the CI/SIG unit,

which was involved in very sensitive operations -- not

operations, investigations pertaining to possible penetrations

of DDP personnel - was it unusual for this unit to open a

201 file on someone like Oswald?

I guess the gist of my question is I don't see how

Oswald is relevant to the primary purpose of CI/SIG.

Mr. Rocca. Well, I would disagree with that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please explain.

Mr. Rocca. I would consider this to be fully within

the competence of this unit, especially in view of the large

number of defectors that had accumulated by this time.

There were others, Americans, in many instances, people

that, it is my recollection, we regarded as more serious,

potentially, losses. I can remember one who had the

specifications of a nozzle that prepared plastic in a

particular fashion. There was press stuff in the interim,

two clippings that had come out. Patricia Blake had

written her articles.

In other words, there was an accumulation of material

which concerned Americans, and a gathering interest at that

time, 1959 and 1960, in the KGB, ultimately confirmed by

Golitzin, as I reported yesterday, that no defector from the

American armed forces - and that list that we had from

State consisted of

at least two or three other military

defectors from West Germany, and I would have considered it

a dereliction not to have opened a 201 file.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, I certainly agree that a 201

should have been opened

at that time, and it would also seem

that the appropriate unit within the Agency to open the file

would have been the CI staff.

My question is more narrowly focused in why would

CI/SIG in particular have been opening the file.

MI. Rocca. Because of their concern, basically,

with the problem of Americans and they were the recipient

of the materials, probably from the Office of security,

if not the actual copy of that material, certainly the chit

chat. Bruce Solie was -- B-R-U-C-E S-O-I-I-E -- constantly

in touch with Mr. O'Neill and with Mrs. Edgerter, I am sure.

Mr. Goldsmith. But from the face of it, it does not

appear that Oswald posed any sort of a counter intelligence

threat in terms of the penetration of DDP personnel.

Mr. Rocca. Of the U.S. security interest. At a very

high level, though, he did, involving other departments

and agencies of the

government.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand, and I am not suggesting|

that a file should not have been opened by the CI staff.

I am just trying to determine why CI/SIG in particular, which

was concerned about DDP penetrations, would have been opening

the file.

Mr. Rocca. Let me go back and open a little parenthesis

about this. What I regard now, in the light of what you said,

is probably a too narrow view of what SIG was interested in.

They were also concerned with Americans as a security

threat in a community wide sense, and they dealt with FBI

cases, with the Office of Security cases, and with other cases

on the same level, as they dealt with our own, basically.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, how would the function of

CI/SIG --

Mr. Rocca. At least, that's as I would represent

it. But again, Mr. O'Neill would be the person to judge

exactly and I would defer to him.

Mr. Goldsmith. How would the function of CI/SIG

in that case be different from in the office of security,

in general?

Mr. Rocca. It would be with respect to where and

what had happened to DDP materials with respect to a defection

in any of these places.

Mr. Goldsmith. Again, though, Oswald had nothing

to do with DDP at this time, at least apparently.

Mr. Rocca. I'm not saying that. You said it.

Let me take the Dunlap case.

Mr. Goldsmith. I'm not familiar with that case.

from the DDP, and indeed coming from Soviet defectors that

had provided the material.

That case, and the handling of the relations with

NSA on Dunlap, was a matter handled by SIG and by Ops jointly:

They worked together on that. It illustrates, therefore,

in another area the community wide aspect to security and

security problems, on the assumption that against the KGB

you've got to work together in cases involving security

and penetration of you are going to be had separately.

This concept is, I think, very definitely an

authorization for the opening by SIG of the file in these

circumstances. And indeed, I would say that to test it, one

should look at whether or not files were opened on the

other names in the State Department list.

If you find that that is the case -- and it is my

belief that that is the case, although I have no way of

proving it because it has never actually ever been put to the

point where it was necessary to do this as a test -- I think

that the question you are getting at is answered.

It is a formal part of their responsibility.

MI. Goldsmith. Fine.

Turning to CIA number 788, again, I would like to

direct your attention to the box that is labeled "other

identification." In that box there is a number one, next to

which someone wrote in the letters "AG."

Do you know what those letters would stand for?

Mr. Rocca. I do not.

Mr. Goldsmith. At the bottom of the page, at the

bottom of this document, it indicates that Oswald's file is

a restricted file.

Do you know why the file would have been restricted?

Mr. Rocca. My impression would be that this would

have been restricted in order to assure knowledge in SIG

in this as one of a category of files involving American

defectors; that they would want to know about in the event

that anyone else developed information or expressed an

interest of any kind.

For example, the Lee Harvey Oswald file was restricted

when it was taken over by R& A, when it was given to me.

Mr. Goldsmith. So that, if anyone --

Mr. Rocca.

So that, if anyone came in and checked

that file --

Mr. Goldsmith. You would know about it.

Mr. Rocca. -- I would know immediately who he was.

I would be asked, "Can this person look at the file, " and

obviously I would permit that.

So, in other words, it is a subsidiary form of

control which permits some kind of internal order in the

processing of the material.

(Pause)

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you please examine CIA number

943, which is a Xerox copy of three file cards. Please

confine your attention simply to the top two file cards,

both of which pertain to Lee Harvey Oswala.

(Pause)

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you had a chance to review this

document?

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Turning your attention to the top

card, which as I indicated refers to Lee Harvey Oswald,

in

the upper right hand corner of that card there is an

indication which says 'CI Project/RE, 9 November, 1959."

Do you know what "CI Project/RE" refers to?

Mr. Rocca. The CI Project refers to -- I don't

know what the Re is at this point, but I may figure it out

by the time I finish talking, answering the first part of

the question -- CI Project is simply a name of convenience

which was used to describe the HILINGUAL OF HDLINGUAL,

or whatever it was. But the RE may be a name or initials of

people. I can't associate that.

This is the first time I have seen these cards,

as

far as I know.

Mr. Goldsmith. But the term "CI Project" to the

best of your knowledge refers to the HDLINGUAL program?

Mr. Rocca.

To the mail intercept program, and

that was the convenient form, that was the phrase that Mr.

O'Neill used when he talked about it.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, this suggests that oswald may have:

been the subject of this mail intercept program or one of the

subjects.

Mr. Rocca. It suggests that there was something

in it that was actually accessioned, or that they were given

this as a warning to be on the alert for it in their screening

of the materials. I cannot determine that from this.

In other words, it may have been a watch list card that flowed

naturally out of the opening.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

(Pause)

Mr. Rocca. Ah -- RE means Rueben Efron.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you spell that for the record.

Mr. Rocca. This is my guess, now, as I say.

And he was a translator on the project.

Mr. Goldsmith. To him?

Mr. Rocca.

Well, to whomever was using

that watch list because it would be used by people surveying

the materials.

You can readily answer your own question by just

going through the materials and spotting them, as far as

the contents are concerned.

MI. Goldsmith. I would like you to review a document

marked CIA number 2035. This is a document dated 20 February,

1964, and it's a memo to you, Chief of the CI/R& A unit.

of two dispatches, seven memorandum from the FBI, one CSCI,

two State Department documents, and 25 cables."

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you remember receiving this

memorandum?

Mr. Rocca. No. But it's not of any particular

import. These materials had been simply displaced for

separate handling on the 201, and I judge that this was

something that Mr. Hartman prepared or had prepared

for me, which I handled through him.

Mr. Goldsmith. The memo doesn't have a signature

attached to it.

Mr. Rocca. Well, it has to be written by someone

who knows, who has access to the material. He and the RID

people are those ones.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it customary for those memos

not to contain signatures of the authors of the memos?

: Mr. Rocca. It depends on how rapidly they are written.

This I think is his signature, is his writing (indicating.)

Mr. Goldsmith. By that you are referring to the.

script notation?

Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Now why do you say that this is of

no particular import?

Mr. Rocca.

Because we know that there are two

were being probably read by MI. Dooley and therefore were not

in the file. We know that there is a CSCI and therefore

all of these are accountable pieces of paper. In other

words, they haven't disappeared. The 25 cables were probably!

in the materials that went back to the GP Floor period.

MI. Goldsmith. Well, how do we know, in fact, that

the materials have not disappeared?

Mr. Rocca. Well, I would say that we know that by

simply going back and looking at the file at the present time,..

to begin with. This was not, in other words, an attempt to

trace materials that had disappeared from the file.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now this document makes reference to

an attachment of the missing --

Mi. Rocca. It says that they should be in the 201

but they are not in it. But that doesn't mean that they are

not present.

: Mr. Goldsmith. The document makes reference to an

attachment which contains a list, a more detailed list, of the

specific documents that are not in the file. The committee

staff has been unable to locate that attachment in the Oswald;

201 file.

What would be the best way to determine whether, in

fact, the documents that were unavailable on this date had,

in fact, been returned to the file?

Mr. Rocca. Ask Mr. Hartman to do it and he will

give you the answer to it. I obviously asked for this, and

as I say, my recollection is I would have asked him for it

pursuant to an attempt to get a grasp over exactly what

should have been -- what should be in the file when we

machined it.

Mr. Goldsmith. If the document is of no particular

import at all, why is it marked "Secret, Eyes Only?"

Mr. Rocca. Everything is marked "Secret, Eyes Only."

MI. Goldsmith. When you say "everything," you --

Mr. Rocca. This is an occupational disease. So

that does not give me great trauma.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are you suggesting that the documents

in the Oswald file commonly contain the sensitivity indicator

known as "Secret, Eyes Only?"

Mr. Rocca. Well, most of them do, I would say.

Or, a good number of them do. I think the point is academic.

I mean, the classification was one applied by a secretary,

whoever typed the memo.

In other words, these papers are not -- this is not a

list of papers that have been removed from the file permanently.

And, I don't recall the circumstances under which at this

time this request was made. But I think the person who worked

on it is a person who probably could shed some light on it.

Mr. Goldsmith. I should indicate for the record that

few documents with the specific notation "Secrety, Eyes Only,"

which is one of the reasons that we focused on this particular

memo, as it suggests that there are materials that are not

in the file, which should be, and particularly because the

attachment referred to is not available in the file itself.

(Pause)

Mr. Rocca. Where do you find the reference to the

attachment? This is what I can't find.

"It is attached, "is that it?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, in the first sentence.

Mr. Rocca.

Well, as I have stated, I have no

recollection of the episode. My best recollection on the

basis of the handling of the time was that this was an

effort to make sure that we had everything together. We

requested this kind of review. This answer came back. I

have no way of explaining why it was "Secret, Eyes Only."

I don't regard it necessarily as of any great significance,

per se. The person who did it would have to explain it.

But I am certain that the next step that I would take

would have been to say to get these items into the file.

Mr. Goldsmith. Of course, we don't know which items

specifically they are.

stage, this is February, 1964, the machine file was in the

process of being accumulated. The file itself was in

use.

We were right at the beginning, in other words, of

assembling the machine record which eventually we would show

and did show to the Warren Commission later on that year.

In other words, I would characterize this document as an

interim summary, a status report, on the attempt to create

the final mechanized record of the file. I in no way would

attribute to this language the fact that these actual materials

were missing.

Mr. Goldsmith. You have indicated that the handwriting

that script writing indicates.

Mr. Rocca. "Please keep loosely in the last volume

one that's been opened, I mean, in the serial performance,

in a looseleaf sense.

In other words, it would be the most

recent one.

Mr. Goldsmith. Okay.

Mr. Rocca. Last in the sense of the most recent one.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please refer to CIA number 2075, which

is the second page of a memorandum to the Director of the FBI!

dated 30 January, 1964. The subject matter is Jack Ruby.

My question is a very narrow one.

This page contains some cross references indicating

which files received a copy of this memorandum, and among

other listings it indicates that a copy went into a file that|

is referred to as a dummy file. This parenthetically indicates

dummy -- "CI/R&A (Dummy) " .

What is a dummy file?

MI. Rocca.

Whoever wrote this kept dummy files,

which would be a file for his own purposes of what he had

sent to us.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is a dummy file then simply a soft

Mr. Rocca.. That would be my best guess under the

circumstance.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you have any basis today for thinking

that Oswald may have been an agent of the KGB?

• Mr. Rocca. I would have to say what I stated

yesterday, that there is no credible evidence at this moment,

at this time, on the basis of the records that we have that

he was a KGB agent in the United States.

If you are asking me as a counter intelligence specialist,

generally what my feelings are on balance regarding his

relationship to the KGB, I would answer that there is no question

that he was debriefed in detail by at least two eschelons of

Soviet authorities, one of which, if not both of which, were

KGB, and if there are indeed two, one was the Thirteenth

Department. I am relying now on defector information for

that judgment.

He himself in his statement, which you have reminded

me of, indicated that he felt free to give that information.

I think it is now ascertained beyond reasonable doubt that he

knew from direct observation enough about U-2 to give that

as a most significant item of information to the Soviets, and

that he himself, as he said, felt free to give radar information.

So, placing together the contact at the camp in California,

rapidity of his release from the Marine Corps, presumably on

compassionate reasons

which turned out to be a trip to the

Soviet Union and all the rest, I would say there is no question,

therefore, about the debriefing and his cooperation.

Mr. Goldsmith. What would the other eschelon have

been that debriefed Oswald?

Mr. Rocca. It would have been one of the screening

units connected with the journalistic apparatus or foreigner

apparatus of the fourth - of the American Department of the

Second Chief Directorate group of the Internal Group which,

however, defers on matters of military specialties-- I

understood this from a defector; I think this is sustained

by others - to the Special Department.

So, there is no question in my mind that he was,

therefore, in their hands.

At that point, it becomes purely speculative, except

that there is much more circumstantial evidence involved

in his handling and treatment in the U.S.S.R. that can be

more pertinently commented to, and was in part pertinently

commented to, in the memoranda submitted to the Warren

Commission, but can be I think more fully and pertinently

commented to by the defectors available today, which show

highly specialized and favorable treatment.

There is also the fact - and this is just pure --

are we on the record?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Mr. Rocca.. This is just pure counter intelligence

lab work, and as I say, it's absolutely impossible

• to talk

about these things in public, but Minktenbaugh, a confessed

Soviet spy -- M-I-N-K-T-E-N-B-A-U-G-H -- another who went to

the Soviet Union in 1959 and 1960 -- he was connected with

Johnson, the Sergeant Johnson case -- was assessed, trained,

and returned to the United States on a separate mission. He

had made his contact in Berlin, as had Johnson.

The interesting thing is that they presented him to a

woman who was to come to the United States with him as a wife.

under the guise of a wife. He is a homo, and so the thing

did not work, though they tried. But the M-O, if you put the

Marine business together, is close to exactness on the

methodology, that is, the setting up of a couple, but the

timing is what is interesting -- 1960.

These are just things that keep you thinking in the

middle of the night. Was the case officer who handled

Minktenbaugh and who we know by his own confession and polygraph-.

now he is out and serving time and he has, as I judge, told

his story completely -- was he part of the same -- here,

Minktenbaugh is an Army defector, or Air Force, whatever.

Think about the problem of recruitment in a gross sense that

the Soviets would have. Note these associations in time and

space.

in the press immediately, as I recall.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Was the allegation ever brought to your

personal attention?

Mr. Rocca. No, not for any action.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were you ever directed to conduct an

investigation into this?

whether there were any traces in all of the files of the agencies

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you think that the issue is

sufficiently important to have warranted a written report to

you in 1963 or 1964?

Mr. Rocca. Well, if there was no substance to it, I

think not.

We were not investigating this. I mean, this was a

matter actually of pertinence to the Office of Security,

to the Director, to MI. Helms, and the others, and if there

were to be a formal investigation, I would have said they

would have done it.

Certainly in the staff meetings this question was

raised at the highest level -- has this man ever been in touch?

So, this was not one of the, in other words, one of the

questions that I was given formally to work on. It was a

matter of personal interest.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall whether Mr. Helms

ever asked you to examine this question?

MI. Rocca. As far as I know, he never asked me, no.

Nor did MI. Angleton.

That is the best of my recollection at this moment.

Mr. Goldsmith. I know.

Now, in 1975, you were no longer Chief of the CI

staff, were you?

Mr. Rocca. I never was the Chief of the CI staff.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you.

I stand corrected.

(Pause)

MI. Rocca.

Hah -- he did remember it.

(Pause)

MI. Rocca. Well, I find this -- I'm glad it exists.

It bears out my recollection.

Mr. Goldsmith. Okay.

Mr. Rocca. But bear in mind that this was something

that I did out of absolute deep, deep personal animus.

Well, that's the wrong word —- that is, the suggestion that

to me I still find greatly offensive. This is the last man

in the world who could have ever been -- who would have

ever met our criteria for recruitment.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you be more specific in the

reason for that?

Mr. Rocca.

psychiatric record, his conduct -- this is now on the basis

of what we learn from the record, and it just seemed to me

just so incongruous and vicious that -- I lose my temper,

I'm sorry.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are most of the agents that work with

CIA case officers necessarily stable individuals?

For example --

MI. Rocca. There are some very definite rules

governing the psychological stability of agents, and these

rules break down into about, among others -- one is their

background record in terms of family and associations;

second, their innate qualifications on testing; third, whether

they

have told you everything about themselves, whether you

know

everything about them; and finally, whether they are

psychologically stable.

So, you have

a whole series of qualifications that he

would fail.

MI. Goldsmith. The criteria that you are referring to

now which pertained to whether someone would meet the Agency's

requisite for serving with the Agency as an agent, are these

criteria formally adopted in any Agency regulations or

documents of some kind?

MI. Rocca. They're in a handbook.

Mr. Goldsmith. And was the handbook in existence in

1959?

Mr. Rocca. Indeed.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, it would be very easy, for

example, simply to --

Mr. Rocca. This was a part of the training. The CI

staff wrote the handbook. I wrote it, or edited it.

Mr. Goldsmith. What is the title of the handbook?

Mr. Rocca. It's called "Criteria for Double Agents."

In this case it would have been a person in touch with two

services.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would the same criteria apply to someone

who is not necessarily a double agent?

MI. Rocca. It would apply to all agents. They apply

to all agents.

Mr. Goldsmith. And such a handbook was in effect in

Mr. Rocca. That handbook was in existence and was a

It was a part of the job of R & A to draw up these criteria,

which had not been previously drawn up in the OSS history.

So, on my record of observation of individuals, the

study of the background and history of the entire topic --

and we covered it in detail, that is, reading the background

this man would have been rejected out of hand. He would never

have been considered.

to the same point with him.

But this is off the record -- this is not off the

record. I mean, this is just a joke.

Mr. Goldsmith. Referring again to 201, to CIA number

201, this is a memo that was prepared apparently by Mr.

Hartman.

Do you know at whose request Mr. Hartman would have

prepared this memo dated in 1975?

Mr. Rocca. He prepared it at my request, I think.

Mr. Goldsmith. No, this memo -- well, you were no

longer with the Agency formally in 1975. Would he have

prepared this memo for you in 1975?

MI. Rocca. I was still on contract with him, and

this was still, this was certainly pertinent to what the

Rockefeller Commission was doing. It is my recollection,

inasmuch as I have already recalled it in part -- you see,

when I mentioned that your previous question had referred to

1963, well, I recall that part where he did refer to 1963.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, in 1975, you asked --

Mr. Rocca. I simply asked him to do this because

I recalled that we had at my instance undertaken within the

staff on my own responsibility this kind of thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. What was the purpose of your asking

him to prepare this memo in 1975?

Mr. Rocca. To

get on the record his recollections of

what had happened in 1963 with respect to this gross

allegation.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, by asking him to do that, were

you recognizing that Mr. Hartman had not gotten on the record

in 1963 when he conducted the initial investigation?

MI. Rocca. No, no.

At that time he did this and reported to me. It was

a purely internal matter. But by 1975, it seemed to me

worthy of putting down on the record.

Mr. Goldsmith. But in 1963 it was not put in the

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, it was not.

Let me say that we were, of course, hamstrung by

allegations in the record which we informally checked out

in that fashion. So, I mean, this was perfectly, I think,

normal.

Mr. Goldsmith. I note that the 1975 memorandum goes

into very great detail as to all the steps that Mr. Hartman

took to determine whether Oswald had any connection with the

Agency.

25

Does this extensive detail strike you as somewhat

unusual for a memorandum written twelve years after the

investigation was actually conducted?

Mr. Rocca. No:

about where he had gone.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, I notice that in CIA number 2106,

letter E, he indicates that through the Security Research

Section of the Office of Security, he had the security files

checked. There was no record of Oswald.

Now, in fact, the Security Office did have a record

on Oswald in 1963. Did that strike you as an incongruous

Mr. Rocca. I don't think that view is referring to --

that that was referring necessarily to the topic of the

interest, namely that there was any kind of a relationship

with him that involved the Agency, or else they simply

didn't tell him. It certainly would be incongruous if they

had a file.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, we have seen several Office of

Security documents pertaining to Oswald, preassassination.

Mr. Rocca. That's right, and you have to know which

office in the Office of Security you are talking to. I can't

judge this one at all, except in terms of these two elements:

(a) that it may have been a part of the Ofice of Security

that literally didn't have a file; or that the file that

they showed him was totally derivative, consisting of press

and other well known items, and therefore he did not consider

it really new information or significant information within

the terms of the memorandum.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, on CIA number 2108, he indicates

that there are five documents which had been sent to the Agency

before the assassination. "Two of the documents have been

by the Department of State, and one by the U.S. Navy."

So, in other words, Mi.Hartman felt that prior to the

assassination there were five documents from other agencies in

Oswald's 201 file.

MI. Rocca. Well, some of them you have actually

shown me, or I thought so -- I mean, they seem to have been

in the file.

Mr. Goldsmith. Off the record.

document that I was going to refer you to at this point.

The specific one I have in mind is a --

MI. Rocca. Well, I can check this record against the

actual records in the files. I assume that this represented

his best statement.

MI. Goldsmith. In fact, that statement contradicts

the listing of documents that was given to the Warren Commission

by Mr. Helms in 1964.

Mr. Helms indicated that there were,

or at least his list indicated that there were more than

five documents received from otheragencies.

Mr. Rocca. Well, Mr. Hartman erred, then, or at least |

I would assume on this, unless he actually had some kind of

consultation with the record, which he could have had, inasmuch

as these materials were at hand. I would say that there is

no doubt that -- in other words, there is no definitive

significance to be attached to that expression. On recounting

he may find six, or he may find four. He was not, I think,

in putting this memorandum together --

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what a DBA is?

MI. Rocca. DBA, I would judge, is a bureau, is a

bureau indicator.

Mr. Goldsmith. According to that memorandum by

Mr. Helms, there were substantially more than five documents

in the file. I am wondering what the reason for the inconsis-

tency is between the Helms record and the Hartman memo.

Mr. Rocca. I think that you could undoubtedly work

it out and it would turn out to be something completely

(excusable) because the DBA memo -- this is a cryptonym

for bureau material.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Burke has located the document.

According to this document, which is CIA number 2038,

prior to the assassination, included in Oswald's 201 file

were seven documents from the FBI, ten from the Department of

State, two from the Department of Navy, one from the

Immigration and Naturalization Service, and then there were

a notation which I would like you to review. In parentheses

it indicates "inventory of documents contained in file

have been definitive.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, you indicated earlier that you

did not regard it unusual that Oswald's 201 file was opened

over a year after the first indication of his giving information

to the Soviets was. obtained by the Agency.

MI. Rocca. But only within a few months of the

receipt of the first information regarding this as I under-

stood it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, the information was initially

received in October of 1959.

The file was opened in

December of 1960, over a year after the initial receipt of

the information.

In October or November of 1960, the State Department

sent information and it was sometime after the State Department

communicated to you and Oswald that the file was opened.

Mr. Rocca. In other words, we're arguing here the

stimulus and how close to the action the stimulus was.

MI. Goldsmith. Exactly.

MI. Rocca. I'm saying that the stimulus -- speaking

for Miss Edgerter, I don't know what prompted her to do this,

or the timing, because it was not my component. I had no

knowledge that the action even was being done. In fact,

I was pleasantly surprised on the 23rd, which was a Friday,

to know that we -- and I learned this on Saturday morning

when I went into the office -- that we even had a 201 on

disadvantages and any kind of cooperation that you get has to

grave difficulties we have in working against an integrated

adversary.

Mr. Rocca. 1940, and revised at various times

periodically. It still exists and it governs and lays down

the ground rules.

No one did, incidentally.

MI. Goldsmith.

Even though Oswald may have had

information of a positive intelligence nature, in other words,

not only did Oswald pose an interest to the American

intelligence community because he may have been a counter

intelligence security threat, but he also had access to

information on the Soviet Union that might have been of

positive intelligence significance, is your position still

that no component within the Agency would have had an

interest in debriefing him?

MI. Rocca. Would not have had a legitimate interest

on its own to have done this. It would have had to

coordinate with the Navy or with whatever component had the

responsibility under the Delimitations Agreement.

Mr. Goldsmith. Despite the fact that Oswald may have

had positive intelligence information?

Mr. Rocca. Indeed, indeed.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please refer to CIA number 2137,

which is a memo for Mr. Rankin dated 1 July, 1964, specifically

dealing with the question of how Oswald was able to make

the trip on a direct flight from London to Helsinki on

October 10, 1959 and arrive at his downtown hotel in

Helsinki by midnight of the same day, when the only flight

• This has been an issue that has received some attention

recently. I am wondering whether the Agency was ever able

fully to resolve this question.

Mr. Rocca. As far as I know, they were not. They

gave up -- there was a time schedule worked out and passed

to this Commission. This was a report done by Mr. Murphy's

people, that Mr. Wigren, who I mentioned yesterday, worked

on. I cannot judge its relevance without reading it. But

I do agree that there is a - he did move fairly fast.

But that may be just traveller's luck.

(Pause)

Mr. Rocca. I can add nothing to this.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was the Agency ever able to resolve

the question of how Oswald was able to obtain a visa to enter

the Soviet Union as quickly as

he did?

Mr. Rocca. This, too, was a matter prepared by

the appropriate component. I cannot recall its specific

details or really judge it in terms of its definitive

quality. I think probably we did the best job we could

on it.

which 2137, Duncan was the researcher in SB Division who

worked on the problem and prepared the memorandum.

I certainly am not qualified to challenge conclusions

they reached.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am not asking you to challenge their

conclusions.

I am asking you whether any additional information

ever came to your attention pertaining to this issue.

MI. Rocca. Ah, that's another matter. I'm sorry, I

didn't understand that.

No.

Mr. Goldsmith. According to CIA number 2047, which

I will read to you in relevant part, it indicates that an

Agency source stated that there was no record that there was

any request for a U.S.S.R. visa processed through normal

channels for Oswald at any time during 1959, and the source

indicated it was difficult to explain how Oswald might have

received his visa in two days without going through normal

channels.

"The only conclusion which can be drawn is that

Oswald must have received his visa directly from the soviet

Embassy in Stockholm, which occasionally has done special

cases." But the source has no evidence to confirm this

assumption.

resolve the question of how Oswald was able to obtain his

visa so expeditiously?

Mr. Rocca. No. I do not believe that they were able

to do that. This is, however, one of the open questions

that should be worked on.

Mr. Goldsmith. Does that suggest in your mind that

Oswald may have had an intelligunce connection of some kind?

Mr. Rocca. Indeed.

Let me -- strike that. It would suggest that if

indeed it turns out that he did have facilitation in his visa

of that kind--in other words, that visa facilitation would

tend to suggest that and not the other way around, as I

originally indicated.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would Mr. Hartman's investigation

into the question of whether Oswald was connected with the

Agency also have led him to determine whether Oswald was an

agent o some other U.S. intelligence agency?

Mr. Rocca. I think probably not.

Mr. Goldsmith. You mentioned earlier that --

MI. Rocca. Though I reserve. If he mentions in his

memorandum the Inter-Agency Source Defector List, which I

think he should have checked, there should have been a

reference there.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would that conclusively indicate

whether Oswald was an agent of another agency?

misstated the list -- this is the Inter-Agency Source

provisions governing coordinating had been carried out,

there would have been a drop card in there.

So, the answer to your question would be yes, at least

as a start.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall whether the warren

Commission was at all particularly concerned with regard to

the question of whether Oswald was an agent of the CIA?

MI. Rocca. No questions of that kind, as far as I

can recall, were directed through this working level association

that I had with Slawson and Coleman and others on this

point, as far as I know.

Mr. Goldsmith. Although apparently there was a meeting

with Mr. Dulles that you attended where Dulles indicated to

you that the Warren Commission had asked him to investigate this-

question..

Mr. Rocca. The meeting with Mr. Dulles, as you kindly

noted yesterday, was for another purpose, and he simply brought

that in as a matter of collateral, reading the memorandum,

as he tended to do, of course. This was a matter that had

come up.

So, there was, apparently, an interest to

the extent

that Rankin talked to him about it.

he should be objective in these matters. That would be my

bad faith on his part and I can't go beyond that because

I don't know any more facts.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, does the fact that he obtained

this early discharge suggest to you that Oswald may have had

intelligence associations of some kind?

Mr. Rocca. Not necessarily. People would have.

done this -- lots of people get out of the armed forces

for various reasons. I don't think that alone can really

stand the weight of the interpretation that you have

suggested here, taken together with the meeting with

presumably the Cuban, whoever it was, that Delgado describes,

the Schweitzer correspondence, which apparently should be

looked at again in terms of whether or not it was really a

screen, because if it was, then it shows a degree of

deliberateness which associates itself with the request for

compassionate departure from the Marine Corps. It tends then!

to accumulate points on a line that this was a deliberate

course of action.

But even when you put all of that together, you are

far from anything that would exclude any contrary hypotheses,

and that is what you are trying to get out of analysis.

For that reason, as I said yesterday, you have to be

very, very careful in drawing conclusions.

Mr. Goldsmith. Excuse me.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated yesterday that you did

not have any memory of the Gutierez allegation.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you have any responsibility

with regard to the CIA's handling of the Nosenko issue?

Mr. Rocca. During the time of the Warren Commission?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

• Mr. Rocca. None at all.

Mr. Goldsmith. Which unit was responsible for

Nosenko at that time?

Mr. Rocca. The handling responsibility was SB

Division.

Mr. Goldsmith. Does that stand for Soviet Branch?

MI. Rocca. Soviet Branch, Soviet Division - Mr. Murphy.

In the staff which would have had an interest, the components

concerned would have been Ops, the Ops component, it would

have been Mr. Hunt.

Mr. Goldsmith . What's Mr. Hunt's first name?

MI. Rocca. James Hunt - not Howard Hunt.

And, perhaps even Mr. O'Neill and SIG, although I

cannot say on this.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever have any involvement

in the Nosenko case?

Mr. Rocca. Later.

Mr. Goldsmith. When was that?

MI. Rocca. In 1966 - 1967.

Mr. Goldsmith. What was your role at that time?

Mr. Goldsmith. The reason that it would be relevant

is because of the manner in which Mr. Nosenko was handled by

the Agency vis-a-vis the information that was given about him

to the Warren Commission. It requires the committee to look

into both his treatment in 1964 as well as years subsequent

to that time.

MI. Rocca. My entry into the Nosenko case -- I am

perfectly wiling to discuss this -- I think it enters into

certainly Mr. Marcucci's indication -- was in connection

with the review and appraisal of the final report prepared,

or the first draft final report prepared by the Soviet

Division on the case, and their proposed recommendations

for the handling of the case which, as I say, took place

in '65, '66, or '67.

I was asked -- by that time, in other words, the case

had reached a concrete stage of, a pile of, a report that

was nearly a foot high. I was asked to read it and to comment

upon it and its recommendations.

Mr. Goldsmith. What was your assessment of that report?

Mr. Rocca. My assessment of the report was -- and this

is on the record, and there is a report, and I defer all of

my remarks here to that paper, because the question is a

complex one--that the report should be cut down by at least

half; that it was too long; and that the overall diversity

of the report, which included a lot of other elements that

were not related to the Nosenko case, concerned other

aspects, like the Golitzin case, be cut out of it, because

they simply encumbered it; that overall, the appraisal that

was made that he was a dispatch defector -- and that certain

action should be taken by the FBI to confirm this or to review

it and to take further action with respect to his stay in

the United States -- should be looked at with great care

because he had rights under the circumstances.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who made the actual decision to detain

Nosenko under hostile conditions during the period in which

he was in CIA custody?

Mr. Rocca. The Chief of SB Division, to the best

of my knowledge.

Mr. Rocca. This is not within my competence to

answer because I don't know the thing. It concerns -- in

other words, you are asking me questions that deal with the

period that was antecedent to the time that I came into the

case.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did Mr. Angleton ever discuss that

with you?

Mr. Rocca. On the basis of hearsay, then, discussions,

MI. Angleton would have wanted a much longer period of

interrogation based on the actual materials that had been

accumulated before anything like hostile interrogation was

undertaken, if at all. In other words, to my recilection,

in my recollection, there was a significant difference on

this point. But it was ex post facto;: the decision had

already been taken and made and that was irreversible at

that time.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what role Mr. Helms had

in making that decision?

Mr. Rocca. I do not.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to discuss with you briefly

a hypothetical, and I am aware of the Agency's position regarding

Nosenko today.

Hypothetically, if it could be established without

any doubt that the story that Nosenko gave to the FBI and the

CIA regarding the manner in which Oswald was handled in the

Soviet Union -- if it could be established that that story

was completely untrue or completely unbelievable, what

significance would that have on the question of whether

Nosenko was a bona fide or a dispatched defector?

MI. Rocca. It might have no significance, or it might

have much significance.

He could be a bona fide defector who had been fed

these materials on the basis of some kind of preknowledge

that it was his intent to go and that he is therefore an

unwitting bearer of a version of the case. Or, on the

other hand, it could indicate that he is a controlled channel

of communication.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, your opinion is --

Mr. Rocca. And there are shades of in between

these two.

Mr. Goldsmith. Your opinion is that that doesn't cut

either way, then, in terms of the accuracy of his --

Mr. Rocca. No, it doesn't. It cuts both ways.

I mean, this is the point. It doesn't resolve it to the

exclusion of any other hypothesis, which is what I was

talking about is the nature of the evidence that you need

here, and until you get it, you've damn well got to keep it

out of the press, it seems to me, because you create problems,

then, at the human level that are really irresolvable. That

is what is, of course, dangerous.

I thought you were going to ask a totally different

question, which is how would it affect the whole hypothesis

of Oswald in the KDB, which would strike me as being a

much more relevant question to ask.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, Mr. Rocca, I'm afraid that you

anticipated my next question.

MI. Rocca.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why don't you answer that one now.

Mr. Rocca. Well, I would have to do it the same way,

Mr. Goldsmith.

It would take, in other words -- it would take very,

very hard evidence either of an agent character or of a

cipher breakthrough to convince me that he was a mandated

killer to begin with, because the nature of the crime, his

conduct and association with the deed are such that this

responds entirely to what I would consider a self-motivated

act.

So, even if, in other words, he were in touch with

the KGB and an agent--and that would be the implication if

you drew the evidence on Nosenko as being a phony agent,

right -- coming back to your question - I still believe

you would be far from the point of being able to go into the

World Court or the United Nations or into a diplomatic

demarche or indeed into something even more serious and

state this to have been the causative act.

Is that being fair on the evidence?

It seems to me this is what is required in a case of

this seriousness.

Mr. Goldsmith. I just have one more question to ask

you prior to taking a brief recess.

Mr. Rocca. Let me add, however, what I said yesterday,

that notwithstanding that question, there is no question in

an individual named Mohammed Reggab.

Let's see. This is a person in Berlin.

I don't know that I have reviewed this.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Reggab was an individual who came

forward and indicated that at one time he had been a boyfriend

of Marine Oswald, and he gave the authorities on her background

that differed from the story that Marina herself gave.

he was going to start working for the Agency.

Mr. Rocca. Incidentally, are you still talking

hypothetically?

MI. Goldsmith. Well, if you would like to discuss

something hypothetically, I am open for it.

• Mr. Rocca. I want to revert to the Minktenbaugh

analogy and the woman and the case, the Mo.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please do.

Mr. Rocca. These things, identities in time and space

and method, are significant, at least at the laboratory level,

so that the kind of thing that the Soviets might have had in

mind for Oswald and Marina--if that is her true name,

whatever her identify is, and if we do know all about her,

and my great regret is that she was not polygraphed, as Ruby

was -- I think this is very definitely a portion -- because

she certainly to Patricia Blake said things that I had not

heard on the record before about her past.

The Walker thing fits better into the pattern of a

special kind of operational thing, if you, indeed, can believe

that Walker was a part of Oswald's interest, as she claims

it was.

So, you have, in other words, coming back to the

hypothesis, that element of taint with Oswald on the part

of the KGB. But I do feel that however you press it on the

basis of the present "evidence" -- in quotes -- it still

falls short of suggesting that he was a mandated killer in

this instance.

I want to make that perfectly clear.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Let's take a brief recess at this time.

• (A brief recess was taken.)

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to inform you, Mr.

Rocca, having just taken this brief recess, that I have had:

occasion to review some additional documents that were

provided to me by the Agency.

Yesterday you made reference to a second memorandum

that you had prepared with regard to the work of the

Rockefeller Commission and that document has now been made

available to us.

Mr. Rocca. In its entirety?

Mr. Goldsmith. So far as I know, in its entirety,

so that many of the points that were raised yesterday, where

you made reference to the memorandum, will be pursued by

my staff and myself. But I just wanted to clarify that

because there was some suggestion that there was a memorandum

that was missing and, in fact, it has turned up.

Mr. Rocca.

Good.

Mr. Goldsmith. I have a few questions to address

to you. Basically they are of a wrap-up nature, followup

questions based upon our review of yesterday's discussion.

First, dealing with Luisa Calderon, the suspected

like you to refer to CIA number 1843, which is a cover

page to a transcript. The transcript is the one that

contains the conversation in which Luisa Calderon makes

her cryptic reference to the Kennedy assassination and

suggests that she may have had foreknowledge.

I am not going to go into any detail with regard to

the transcript itself as you and I have already discussed

the substance.

I would simply ask you to read 1843 and tell me if

you can identify whose handwriting appears on that page.

we talked about this yesterday.

I'm afraid I cannot recognize it, I'm sorry to say.

It just makes no impression. It looks like a woman's

handwriting, but these are just guesses.

Mr. Goldsmith. The handwriting indicates that a

transcript is to be sent to someone named Galbond--

G-A-LAB-O-N-D -- via Kingman.

Do you know who those individuals were?

MI. Rocca. I do not. My guess would be that

this has to do with the Warren Commission and their receipt of

the material.

Mr. Goldsmith. The notation, the handwritten notation,

also indicates the following comment: "Nothing to Buro" --

Do you know whether this transcript was ever given

Mr. Rocca. No. Whether that transcript was or not,

I cannot say. They already knew the substance of it, of

course, from the earlier transmissions. My guess is that

this was the translation from Spanish that was done for the

Commission by the Agency.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether the FBI was

specifically informed about the conversation that Luisa

Calderon had in which she made the reference to the Kennedy

assassination?

Mr. Rocca. I'm certain of it -- that is, I can't

prove it by the papers that were shown to me yesterday. But

I would be certain of it in my own mind.

(Pause)

MI. Rocca. As I say, it is my recollection that

these things were translated for the Commission by the Agency:

They would be done by people in WH Division who had the

competence in the language, and therefore there would be

different components involved and different routings,

obviously.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall ever seeing any cable

traffic that made specific reference to Luisa Calderon

and this conversation?

This memorandum is Win Scott's summary memorandum.

Again, things can be omitted from memoranda, and I would

assume that that's the case in this instance.

He was so firmly committed -- Win was, personally --

to the fact of Cuban involvement. In fact, he went far

beyond what I would regard as publicly discussible, inferential

judgments in that regard, in his discussions with me that I

can't believe absolutely that he would ever withhold it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you give us a summary now of

what Mr. Scott's theories were with regard to the possibility

of Cuban involvement.

Mr. Rocca. He felt that there was very definitely

the possibility of Cuban involvement with Oswald, but he

could not arrive at any definite information. And frankly,

I showed you a document labeled CIA number 2138, which is

that Mr. Angleton does not desire to respond directly to

the request from Mr. Rankin for some materials.

In the second paragraph you indicate that Mr. Angleton

would prefer to wait out the Commission in the matter covered

by paragraph 2.

Would you please review this at this time.

operation in Mexico City, and specifically the relationship

between that operation and the Mexico mystery man?

it is unclear specifically what it is referring to. That's

Mr. Rocca. Well, it's very clear that this is unclear.

too, because it refers to something unclear, it seems to me.

In other words, it sounds like something that had been

gotten to Rankin in a kind of vague and hazy way, that was

really not substantively new, that he made an issue of, and

that this refers to simply avoiding duplicating needlessly

a paper that had already been disposed of, or taken care of,

that this material was not of any new substantive interest

and

" that it was already being taken care of, it would avoid

a needless stage of reproduction and of discussion -- I think

is the intent behind this.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you when the Warren Commission staff

was told about the Mexico City photograph?

Mr. Rocca. I cannot recall the date of it, but they

came over and received the photograph and looked at it from

my very hands. I had in my hand an envelope containing the

entire run of the photographs that had been submitted to me

by the desk, the WH desk, Mr. Whitten, as of that time.

What date that was -- it could be May, it could be

April, it could be March. I think it was later -- it was

sooner rather than later.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let me show you a document labeled

24 March, 1964, The subject is Mexico City, CIA dissemination

of information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The document, rather,

is labeled March 26, 1964, and it is an internal memo,

Warren Conmission staff, CIA number 2221 and 2222. In 2222,

the author of the memo indicates as follows: "As you know,

we are still trying to get an explanation of the photograph

which the FBI showed Marguerita Oswald soon after the

assassination. I hope that paragraph four of the memo of

March 24, 1964, sent Mr. Rankin by the CIA is not the answer

which the CIA intends to give us to this inquiry."

of March 24?

Do we have paragraph four of the memorandum

MI. Goldsmith. That letter, unfortunately, is not

available. The Agency did not send that to us.

Mr. Rocca. My recollection is that whatever this

confabulation implies, that at some particular point -- and

I don't remember the date, it was either at the end of March

or April -- they came over and I showed them personally--

Mr. Goldsmith. Youwould certainly agree that by the

that came out of my reflections on our talks yesterday and

also today is the fact that these are all bricks assembled

relationship with which these bricks were handled at the time.

In this particular case, while they may not have had

the final explanation or even an explanation that we ourselves

were satisfied with inasmuch as we were dependent on reports

from Mexico City, they certainly were aware of the fact that

the thing was being worked on and that the issue existed.

In other words, there was no question of withholding -- and

this took place at the conversational level and was obviously

unrecorded in any way. I find myself impossible here to fill

in the proper cement on the operational level that would make

some of these bricks more plausible than they would seem,

as they are taken out and just held up.

But I have an absolute recollection of giving them

these photographs, and in the memorandum that you've

gotten

today, you will see that it turned out that there were even

more photographs in the file -- not of the particular eight

men, but of others in the coverage which they provided in

'75.

Now this comes out of the desk.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you agree, nevertheless, that the

author of this memo was not satisfied with the explanation

that the Agency had provided with regard to the photographs

as of that day?

Mr. Rocca. Yes, yes.

He was certainly reflecting that in his internal

memorandum --memoranda.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there ever any effort on the part

of the CIA to coordinate testimony given to the Warren

Commission with the FBI?

MI. Rocca. None that I know of.

Mr. Goldsmith. Off the record.

(Discussion off the record)!

Mx. Goldsmith. What efforts, if any, were made to

prep Mr. McCone prior to any briefings that Mr. McCone

gave to the Warren Commission?

Mr. Rocca. I'm afraid I have to refer to whatever is

in the record, if any, on that, because I did not deal

personally with Mr. McCone on these matters.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there ever a concern evinced by

Mr. Angleton or yourself or Mr. Helms that Mr. McCone give

consistent testimony, either testimony of statements, to the

Warren Commission?

Mr. Rocca. The thought would never have crossed my

mind and, therefore, speaking for myself, the answer is

negative. I have never - I have not heard of anything

involving either Mr. Helms or Mr. Angleton in that respect,

to the best of my knowledge or recollection.

Mr. Goldsmith. Reading from CIA number 2138, which

is a memo for MI. Rocca from Mr. Angleton dated 12 May, 1964,

it indicates as follows: "The DDP wishes to have from you

a short but comprehensive memorandum which highlights the

basic issues or positions entered into by the Agency in its

dealings with the Commission. For example, Rankin indicated

that the Commission would wish to hear the Director's views

to how

improvements might be made in protecting the

President's life. Further, they will probably ask questions

regarding the possibilities that a conspiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates that the DCI

be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews."

That language suggests that there was some concern

for

MI. Rocca. Well, this was a concern for a briefing

paper, as to what the main lines of response should be.

This

is a perfectly normal and regular procedure, followed in

the Agency before and since and in other agencies, and I think

we saw yesterday the briefing paper that went up, that was

the product of, a combined product. But how the paper was

used by Mr. Helms is something that I can't respond to.

You asked me whether or not --

Mr. Goldsmith. Either Mr. Helms or Mr. McCone

apparently--

Mr. Rocca. You asked me about Mr. McCone.

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, and apparently the briefing --

MI. Rocca. So, I have no way of knowing what Mr.

Helms did with the paper, with Mr. McCone, or whether it

was used at all. It would seem to me that as you read their

depositions before the Commission, they had obviously read

the paper or it had been reviewed. However, what they said

was far less substantial than what was indicated there. So

I can't say anything on the basis of a simple analysis at

all at that point.

But this is a routine request for preparing material

for the boss.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there any concern that the boss

woul start making inconsistent statements?

MI. Rocca. Why, I can't believe it. That wasn't

what prompted it. It was that he would have a formal basis

for saying whatever he had to say that would be responsive

to the Commission's needs.

Mr. Goldsmith. During its review of the Agency's

Oswald file and related files, the staff of this committee has

come across transcripts of telephone conversations involving,

for example, Mi. McCone, Mr. Whitten. My question to you is

whether as a matter of routine telephone conversations were

either taped or transcribed by the use of a stenographer

listening to the conversations?

Do you have any knowledge of this taking place in

1963 and 1964?

Mr. Rocca. I have no knowledge that this took place

as far as CI is concerned at any time, which is what I can

seak to. That it was a practice of the Director to have these

conversations recorded is something I think that came out

of the Watergate matter and is therefore a matter of record

for his own use.

But whether any of that was done in 1963, now, is

simply - this is the first I've heard of it.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to show you a transcript

of a telephone conversation between Mr. McCone and Mr. Hoover

dated 26 November, 1963. It is CIA document number 2134.

Does that appear to the a transcript of a telephone

conversation?

Mr. Rocca. Yes, it does.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you read the middle paragraph,

which makes reference to an FBI informant.

(Pause)

MI. Rocca. That's LIENVOY.

That's their material

with the Mexican authorities, because we ran that whole

operation with the Mexicans.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, how would. --

MI. Rocca. I would interpret it that way. .

I have

never read this piece of paper that I recall. That would be

my reaction.

Mr. Goldsmith. For the record, let's get this clear.

The Director of the FBI, Mr. Hoover, is making reference

to an informant that the FBI had in Mexico City, and he is

indicating that the informant has informed the Bureau as to

the contents of Oswald's conversations in Mexico City.

From your answer, I take it that you assume that Mr.

Hoover is referring to the LIENVOY operation.

Mr. Rocca. And he is subtly letting Mr. McCone know

that Mr. McCone's resources down there were not unique, that

they, too, had access to the Mexican operation.

Mr. Goldsmith. LIENVOY was an operation that was run

by the CIA and the Mexican Government?

MI. Rocca. It was a joint operation with the

Mexicans, is my impression, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. It was a liaison operation with the

Mexicans and the CIA?

MI. Rocca. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith.

So, how would Hoover have had access

to this information?

MI. Rocca. By the 26th, or by after the event, he

would have been able to get from the Mexicans I think

everything. I think they just rushed to give him everything.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, he would have had a Mexican

informant, do you think, that might have given him this

information?

Mr. Rocca. I think that that terminology is sort of

standard terminology that he would have used to cover and

sort of mythologize their coverage down there, and that what

he is referring to are Mexican resources that the Bureau would

have independently developed on the case by that time. I

would defer, obviously, to a Bureau man in reading it. But

I think that this is the correct line of interpretation.

Mr. Goldsmith. She was a case officer in Mexico City

working with Win Scott.

Mr. Rocca. She wrote that wonderful summary -

Mr. Goldsmith. Which summary are you referring

' to?

Mr. Rocca, — of the case, of all the file. It's

a thick collection which summarizes every document in the

Mexican file.

Mr. Goldsmith. In the Mexican Oswald file?

Mr. Rocca. Yes, in the Mexican Oswald file. I

don't know. I mean, it may well be, but I certainly have

not dealt with her -- well, I hesitate to use the word

"intimately," but in the sense of this case.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

Do you know Mr. Scott Breckenridge?

Mr. Rocca. Only in terms of the formality of concern

of the Inspector General.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether he was ever

involved in the investigation of the Kennedy assassination?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know at all.
