fur theft, and requested his assistance in the return of the

furs.

TODDO MARINO, true name SALVATORE GAETANO MAIORANO,

influential

member of the GENOVESE

at 20th Street and 5th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY.

RUDY (INU) and DOM PRADO are not sufficiently

identified at this time.

Also mentioned in referenced airtels is the name

JACK LEVINIA (PH), who is apparently a partner with GAETANO

"CORKY" VASTOLA in an illegal alcohol operation.

LEVINIA

is probably identical with JOHN LIVIGNO, NYCPD B# 164755,

age 61, ATTD# 4088. LIVIGNO is also known as JACK LIVIGNY and

JACK LEVINE.

LIVIGNO's' last known residence was 8701 Shore

Road, Brooklyn, NY.

LIVIGNO was described in 1960 by ATTD agents as the

top

moonshiner on the East Coast.

He was arrested in 1954 for

running a 1000 gallon still on the Brooklyn waterfront and

pleaded guilty on 2/19/60, EDNY, Brooklyn, and sentenced

along with his brother, MORRIS LIVIGNO, to 2 years imprison-

ment.

Another moonshiner sentenced with LIVIGNO was

GIOACHINO "LAUNDRY JACK" MENTESANO.

It should be noted that NY 3586-C-TE has associated,

with LIVIGNO in the past and will be discreetly contacted

concerning the locationd LIVIGNO's present operation.
