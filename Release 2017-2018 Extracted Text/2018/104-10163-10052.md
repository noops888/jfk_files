WUNTUNUATION OF a - oes
DISPATCH | SEQRET OS!

ol c. Identity B was very sympathetic and. arranged’ to :
have my suit for reinstatement ‘taken by, Idontity.D: which handled
nost (obYO legal bysiness Tocally,:: In:1951, Identity D- referred
my case to a(ZRieTaL, law firm. whose name I. cannot :recall exactly
ut which initiated Legislative action for me, - I- travelled ‘to
‘RMETALSonce, to lobby on my own behalf; and was able to speak
ith Identity E who promised to make a favorable recommendation, *
Travel costs and other Problems prevented -my following -up,:
however, and nothing ever came of the bill as far. a: know,

@. In 1959 Identity D called me: and. told. me ‘thi my oS
Servicgs would be needed again in view of the Communist: tendencies
of the\ANTHUG-1 )regime. I agreed to cooperate without hesitation, ©
and was introdiiced to Identity F,~KUBARK Chiefof Station, who :
" assigned me. to Identity G. Together we organized a group to: -
infiltrate the Ganune government, _ I was evacuated: to the JMWAVE:
g tH ty family -in the fall of 1960 and was met ‘by Identity
He. In the course of my relations with fim and Identity I, I was -
Promised that my citizenship status would be inquired into
officially, and that my service ‘to KUBARK would resolve any doubts
that might have. existed in the. case,

In the summer of 1961, I decided in sheer desperation-

to drive t TAL Jand to ask Identity I for. direct help’ in the.
citizenship matter. My JMWAVE contacts, I explained, claimed that ::
there was no. record of my quest for citizenship reinstatement,

- Identity I sent someone to take notes on my case, and also intro~

Identity J later advised me that my file had been mislaid, but
that the case was being reactivated,

os £2, In March 1962, cover business Provided an opportunity.
for me to leave the country long enough to re~enter with a

permanent residence visa, At that time I was told by the Immi- i
gration officer (to ny dismay) that my five-year waiting period for -

citizenship would begin on the date of my re-entry, ‘On another it
cover trip in April 1963, I met identity H who said that he could - ul

not believe that my citizenship had not been reinstated by that
time, He said that he and Identity I had been given to understand ..
- that-it was all taken care of,

&. I wish to make the record clear that I have never
applied for citizenship in any other country;. that ‘1 ea everything
possible under the above circumstances to maintain my ¥
citizenship; that I tried by every means available to have my
citizenship reinstated after I learned that it been taken from
me (without a hearing, by the way); and that the’
used in my evacuation was procured only after assurances from
Identity F that.the ection would-net have Su adverse effect: u;
attempts to. reinstate~my- citizenship, ;

3, It be appreciated if Headquarters could find gome
way of expediting uclaTitei'a}eace, Bringing this predicament to
& eatisfactory conclusion would relieve him of @ personal dilemma.
which might weigh heavily to the detriment of hig operational. ~.
effectiveness. Any questions or instructigns on the matter up unti.
20 August should be referred to(AMCLATTER through his training

case officer (note reference ai previous correspondence for train~
ning site), :

3. F'your- information, copies of four. identity itons in
CGwcuarreh Possession are alwo forwarded under feparate cov.
