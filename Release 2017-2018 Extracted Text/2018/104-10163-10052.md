Identity B was very sympathetic and arranged to

for reinstatement taken by Identity D which handled

my case to a biSTAL law firm whose name I cannot recall exactly

but which initiated legislative action for me. I travelled to

to lobby on my own behalf, and was able to speak

with Identity E who promised to make a favorable recommendation.

and other problems prevented my following up,

however, and nothing ever came of the bill as far as I know.

In 1959 Identity D called me and told me that my

services would be needed again in view of the Communist tendencies

of the (ANTHUG-1 regime.

I agreed to cooperate without hesitation,

and was introduced to Identity F, KUBARK Chief of Station, who

ssigned me to Identity G.

Together we organized a group to

Infiltrate the PBRUMoN government: I was evacuated to the JWAVE

ret with my family in the fall of 1960g

Hi. In the course of my relations with him and Identity I. I was

promised that my citizenship status would be inquired into

pificially, and that my service to KUBARK would resolve any doubts

that might have existed in the case.

In the summer of 1961, I decided in sheer desperation

to drive to mETAlland to ask Identity 1 for direct help in the.

citizenship matter.

My JIWAVE contacts; I explained, claimed that

there was no record of my quest for citizenship reinstatement.

At that time I was told by the Imi

trip In April 1963, I met Identity E who said that he could

not belleve that my citizenship had not been reinstated by that

time.

He said that he and Identity I had been given to understand:

that it was all taken care of.

I wish to make the record clear that I have never

applied for

citizenship in any other country; that I did evarything

possible under the

above circumstances to maintain my BPRIME

oitizenship; that I tried by every means avallable to have my

oitizenship reinstated after I learned that it had been taken from
