In his opinion, people treasures the

he cited the case of one virl who carried

coples in her handoad to snow to other girla in her office.

only criticism of the periodicals was that at times they becane a

little too flowery.

In his words, "Inere were too many adjoctives.*

He thought that a more direct approach would bo nore effoctive.

5. Persoral Situation of AMERE | subjoct is obviously fascinatod

with the Intellisence vusiness and wishes to continue with us and

establish a career. He desires some formal training. I agreed that

he should get training and said that, whilo he is on vacation, we would;

try to set up some courses for him.

Subject would Iike to have a

contragt with us; he fears that his next arslenent might be for only

# short time and that he will be cut loose when it is completod.

Altiougi we did not discuss it, he evtrently had in mind career

agent status.

I am not aware of Agency policy on assigning agenta

to this status, but I belleve that we hive a real asset in Migusand

that consideration should be given to making him a career agent.

Subject's 201 shows an individual with a bactground voth.of intelligence

and

experience that would indicate an assignnent in any Latin American

country.

In addition, he has denonatrated a natural bent for the

intelligence cusiness. Although his responsibility.was not as great

as that of AIRYE, he nevertheless contrivuled very greatly in

establisment of the staybehind not,

working long hours under most

trying circunstances. His concept of tradecraft is remarkable for

a man who has only been in this businngs for approximitoly nine

Bronths.

When we

were going over the diagram.of the

staybehind net,

he was able to explain in a most logical way the reasons for setting

1t up as 1t 15.

For example, comurleations are arranged from

higher to lover echelons ard, only where necessary, are communications

set up both ways.

Subjoct has gainer in experience in a short

perior of tire what it took most of us years to acquire.. It would

be a shame to let this experience go by the board.
