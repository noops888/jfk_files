on deoriefing of, staybenind net, propaganda effectiveness nd,
primarily, AGRS}6 own future.

3 fakda. Subject stated that the fish synbol appears .
avarywhere. ie has seen. the ‘symbol in elevators, public buildings,
pudlic totlets, bus ard train depots, park benches, etc. His
remark that,."You were always conscious of tien despite the fact
that in most places they were taken down immediately," 1s quite
indicative of the wide distrioution and use of the symbol. ‘Kost
of the symbole that fie’ saw were in chalk father than the blue
stam, Subject believes most people thougt.t the fish to be a
Christian e’nbol rather than a counter ‘revolutionary one,

Subject had seen many clandestine newspapers, leaflets, and
pamphlets even up until the last moment of his departure, He
Listed Avance, Rescate, Prensa Libre, Bohemia Libre ond La Marina
as periodicals he had. sesh. Ié saw them in private hones (most
re. counter revolutionary). Most of tne
copies were quite "bsat'up,"-irdicating’ to him that they had been
passed from rand to hand, In his opinion, people treasurei the
copies that they had. He cited the case of one girl who carried
covies in her handbag to show to other girls in her office. ‘udject's
only ¢riticism of the periodicals was that at timas they became a -
Little too flowery. In his words, "There were too many adjectives.”
He thourht that a zore ‘rect approach would be more effective.

He claiuts that everyoody listens to Radio Swan out nobody :
believes it, He mentioned one ‘Swan broadesst which announced taat *
bodies were lying all over the Malecon and rotting in the sun. '
Listeners went to view this and found that tnere were no oodles
there. Voice of America is listened to ard is quite highly regarded.
Sudject cited two otner oroadcasts that he considers courter
revolutionary and waicn cre well thought of; one oriyinates fro
Mew York and one from Key West, Ye tainks that most people listen
to Miami when conditions are right. I asked way people continue to
listen to Swan if it is so discredited. He stated that, altcouga,
it is not believed, it 4s still a contact with tne outside world,

T arked about Americans 4n pFison. Subject knew'of only BINAIR:
and himself. He clained that, although prison conditions were horrill
during his stay there because of Inck of adequate food ind ssnitation
facilities, the prisoners were not piyeleally abused. ©.

5. Pensoral Situatjon-of. ated | suvsect’é is dbvigusiy fascinated,
with the intelligence vusiness and wishes to continue with us’ and:

establish a-career. He desires some fornal. training. I agreed that
he should get training ard-cald that, vhilo he is on vacation, we would:
try to set up some courses for him, Subject would Like to have.
contract with us; he fears that his next assignment micht be for only
@ short time and that he will be cut loose when it is completed.

Altiough we did not discuss it, ne ¢vicently had in’ mind career
agent status, I am not avare of Agency policy on assigning gente
to this status, but I believe that we have a real asset in AN[HE) and
that consideration should be given to making him a career agent. A
Subject's 201 shoxs an individual with a background voth of intelligence
and experience that would: indicate an assignment in any Latin American |
country. In addition, he has demonstrated 4 natural bent for the
Antelligence cusiness.: Although his responsibility-was not as great
as that of ABRYE, he nevertheless contrivuted very greatly in
estadlisnnent of the staybehind net, working long hours. under most’
trying clrounstances, His*concept of tradecraft is remarkable for
@ man who has only béen in this business for approximitoly nine
months, When we were going over the diagram of the staybehind net,
he was able to explain in a-most logical way the reasons for setting
it up as it is. For example, communications are erranged from
higher to lover echelons ‘ard, only where necessary, are conmunications
set-up both ways. Subject has gained in experience in a short
period of tire what it took most of us years to acquire, It would
be @ shane to let this experience go by the board,

6. Incidentals. Subject claims that, on the second trip that
AMDOODLE 1 rade, included in the pouch were five bottles of Niltown,
three quayaberas, and an item of jewelry that never got to its .
ultimate destination, The first two items were for -is wife; the
other, for a customer of his in Suffalo, ".Y. ile says that he 1s
