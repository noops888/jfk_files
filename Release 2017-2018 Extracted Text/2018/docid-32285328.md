RO MORO Of SA EDWARD I. CARNEY, IR. ON 1/29/689F1

The following sources and informants were contacted

on the dates indicated, and could furnish no information

concerning the subject:

PSI LOTHAR BECKER On 3/8/68;

PSI C√ÅRLOS DE LA VEGA On 3/6/68;

PSI JULIO BONETTI on 2/23/68J

On 2/23/68 NO 1213-S advised that GAUDET was

alcoholic, or close to being an alcoholic, in the late 1950's.

GAUDET drank very heavily and had financial problems during

this period. He once wrote an article for Dictator TRUJILLO,

then head of the Santo Domingo government. This article was

very pro-TRUJILLO, and was believed to have been dictated by

TRUJILLO or one of his right-hand men.

Source described GAUDET as easygoing, and a competent

writer.

He is still believed to be with the Latin American

Report; however, he may do some free-lance writing under a pen

name.

Source commented that GAUDET is liberal with regard

to his views on the South and integration and segregation.

Source advised that he knows of nothing derogatory concerning

GAUDET other than his previous drinking and financial problems.

He does not know if these problems still exist today. He has

no reason tosbelieve that GAUDET is not a loyal United States

citizen. He believes that with his ability: GAUDET could

have been more successful in business than he has.
