Thia Branch ie ergaged in a survey of the above subcect, including

present state of the art, We have canvassed every <=terested
agency except the 731.

-.. We have, on 22 Febrisry 1944, shown our devices and sabotage
weapona to Mosars. Coffoy, Flenagan and Parsons of the FBI. Those
* gentleman suggested that an official request from yoz for entree
fo their laboratory ou the above subject of secret inks, ete.,
would te well receizede

The study of this subject ie in the hands of one mau only. He is
@ chemist and ink expert of internatioral repute and for security
reasons works entirely in a secret laboratory in Rockecter, N.Y.

It is euggested thet opening this subject to our appotntes will

not be entirely a gift on the part of the Bureau to as, but thet
highly interesting information will tharety be mads available to «
the FBI laboratory.

Unfortunately, sprod is very necessary to prevent duplication of
