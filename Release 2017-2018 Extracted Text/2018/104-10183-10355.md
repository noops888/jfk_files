As lodicated, PACHANKIS broke the bad newg

AHMUG1 apparently took the news

as well as could

be expected.

Nevertheless, the Station would apprectate

perlodic notice on the status of AMMUG-l'g case so

we may keep him informed on any progress.

3.

In regard to Reference C, PACHANKIS probed in

PACHANKIS seemed to think, however,

that the wife

d. During the siddle and late 1950s, Roberto

had been a salesnan for

tho burroughs flour company

and had

stayed clear of the political picture in Cuba.

€.

During the sane perlod, lector had been a

student in the Uniyersity of lavana, under Raul ROA,

and had taken part in some revolutionary activities.

He had been arrested and beaten by the Batista police

Ior his anti-governaent actions and his father had

sent hia into exile in the US.

When

Castro came into pover.

the father was

a potential "var crinial" for hig illicit dealings.

AMMUG-], uho vas in tho police force in the Initial

stages of the revolution, states that he deloted an

incrininating page fron

the father's dossier (showing

he paid oll the police to run his bolita operation)

and thus saved his from prosecution.

g.

AMMUG] continued to be close to the family,

specially

with

Roberto,

"whom I say every day and

ran around vith."

Roberto nover entertained the

revolution.

AB

late as 1962-63,

"He used to talk

quite openly and frankly.

He was alvays against the

revolution and

the communists.

He yorked

in the

Ministry of Industry because his brother got him

the

job,

but he had only one idea in his head:

to get out

of Cuba and come to the US.

He was even plotting to

get out by boat.

He had a US visa for many years and

had visited hare many times."

b.

When AlßUG-l defected, he lost contact with

Roverto.

But, about two weeks

ago a neigibor from

Regla cane to

Miant on the Freedon Flights. (COMMENT:

This undoubtedly roferg to Cuban refugee Segundo

CASCUDO Gonzalez.

Referonce forwarded the AMOT

debriefing of CASCUDO on Roberto.)

When AMNUG-1

the neighbor gaid that he under-

asked about Roberto, was assigned in a forelgn

that Robarto,

The refugee could not say that country

"This

would be & most interesting person to talk

the job to get out of

Cuba, and because of the-influence of his brother

Hector.

I know

he will talk to me and there is no

telling what this man is capable of doing 11

someone

approached hin."

j.

Roberto is (or vas) married to:

Zulena (1nu)

DPOB:

c. 1934 in Cuba

They had tro

children and the wife was even

anti-Castro than Roberto.

lector, the other brother,

when AMMUG-1 lnst sai

him in c. 63-64.

He had joinec

the Castro bandwagon at the outset due to his revolutlonary

DETAILED JUSTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT

Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera has cooperated with this

Agency

since his dejection on 21 April 1964

at which time he

turned over to CIA documents from

the Gencral Directorate of

Intelligence he had collected during the preceeding several

months.

In addition, he has provided voluminous, accurate

and valuable information

on

the organization of the Cuban

intelligence services, their operations,

staff members and

agents.

Thesc documents and information have given us the

potential and opportunity to take effective measures to

safeguard United States Government interosts.

Subject has

been of bicat value in the past, and will continue to be in

the tuture,

in the CIA recruitment/descetion program.

His

wide acquaintance among and knowledge concorning high level

Cuban diplomats

and Cuban intelligence personnel provides

the Agency with the necessary background in planning operations

against them and

makes Subjeet ideal

talents

for use in carrying out

in furthering

the defector

program, but in other types of

political action and psychological warfare opcrations.

a result of technical interrogations of RODRIGUEZ

on 11 May 1964 and again on 15 July 1966, his hona fides have

been established not only for intelligence exploitation

purposes but also for the purpose of resettlement in the

United States.

There is no reason to believe that RODRIGUEZ

under the control of any hostile intelligence service.

The medical and psychiatric examinations have shown

that

no serious medical or psychiatric problems.
