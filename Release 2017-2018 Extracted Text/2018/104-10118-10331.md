Finds himself involved in

the development of a connercial venture, an undertaking for which he is

ill equipped..

This chine shortcoming requires very close guidance by

ROWTON and, in turn, makes LIRING-3 even pore dependant on his case officer.

Thus, while LIRING~3 occasionally thinks of returning to

what ne. considers to be little result, LIKING-3 keeps Involving himself

deeper and deeper in activities of interest to ROWTON.

The above does not mean that frang-s's activities should not

be subjected to every operational control possible, on the contraty.

be obtained in Northern Mexico to secure valid Mexican, passports continues;

appear at his hone LIRING/3 agreed to invite Garcia, once he did appear,

a look at bin.

IIRING/2 a100 reported that IIRING/4 had been working part-

time, in the wordings,

and that her rapport with the local

staff was improvidg. Rowton susgested that it might be the right time to give

IIRING/4 some compensation for her etforts. ITRING/3 agreed

and promised to

ask IIRING/4 to belat the safehouse at 1000 on 27 May, so that Rowton could

again talk privately with her and give her the money ( Rowton suggested 500

pesos g

atla IIPING/3 agreed that this would be adequate).

2.-LIRING/3 reported that LIRING/4's resumption of contact had begun to pay

off better than he had thought possible. He explained that she had found an

opportunity on the afternoon of 23 May to chat with

stressed that lie did not

feel that IIRING/3 fell into that category, but IIRING/y must understand the

precautions that have to be taken by the revolution. He concluded that he

3. ICRTNG/3 then stated that he was doing his best to keep active certain

contacts he kad bad in the past that were on the periphery da the official

Cubari girole, He mentioned specifically the case of Silvia and Horacio Duri

that then explained the background of his relationship with them. He ralatea

that Silvia Durán worked as receptionist at the Consulate in 1953-64 and was

on duty when Lee Harvey Oswald applied for a visa. she. had been necomended

she liked him fron the starts she anitted that she had setual relattons with

him but insisted that She bad no idea of ats plans. When the news of the as-

that she had had an affair with oswald. she added that ever since then she. ha

cut oit all contact with the Cubans,

particularly since her busband foracio,

who was badly, snaken by the whole affaire

went into a rage and

sas forbidden her to see them. She added that sae felt certain that ber tele

phone was tapped by the Mexican police, or, more probably by Voract,

since

tapping was an, epensive proposition and the Mexicons wouldn't be able to af-

Iord it for sd long,a period.

5. Rowton counseled LIRING/3 against any further contact with the Durans on

the ground that it migut put him under sona sort of suspicion

either in the

eyes of the Mexican polico or the cubans. Fe pointed out that little or nothi

was to b'a gained from such a contact.

5. LIRING/3 then produced, at Rowton'

s reguests

sketch of the Consulate and

Embassy premises, copy of which is attached, tinno/3 connetted that to his

knowledge Cepeda did not have an office,

at least not on the first faoor. Fis

FOR THE RECORD

Slawson of the Presidential Commission,

telephone cavensation between

Asibastrolor

Cabou

of the Commission in MI. Whitten Soffice. This meeting had been

requested to ask for a fresh translation of the taped conversation

between Cuban President Dorticos atld Ambassador Armas.

Win Scott had told the Commission staff visiting Mexico City that

his translators, in the rush at that time, might have misconstrued

certain nuances of meaning in what was a difficult recording. In

view of this, Mr. Slawson asked that a new translation be made,

if possible, by a person knowledgeable of the Cuban dialect.

According to Mr. Slawson, only Messrs. Rankin,

Willens, Coleman (20 and he presently koow of the telephone taps

in Mexico City. Slawson, Willens and Coleman were briefed on

the taps during their visit to Mexico City.

In about three weeks the staff will begin presenting to

the Commission evidence on the conspirational aspect of the

assassination. At this time, apparently, their evidence is against

the existence of a plot. They will wish to present to the Comitssion

the Armas - Dorticos conversation. Slawson suggested

the posability

that a knowledgeable CIA man could make this presentation, interpreting

the conversation in the light of our study:

M-. Whiten said that we will again translate the tape,

using the best available Cuban linguist, and once again study the

nuances of the conversation.

Any presentation to the Commission,

howevet, would have to be reterred to Messes.

Malms and Rocca

According to MI. Slawson, no member of the

Commission now knows of the telephone taps in Mexico City the did

not mention Mr. Dulles).

. M?- Whitten carefully briefed Mr. Slawson (probabl

rebriefed-him) on the importance of these telephone taps to Ú.S.

"security and the grave damage that would be done to U.S. - Mexican

relations ifk

nowledge of their existence became public.

6. pr. Slawson quite clearly was a bit unhappy that certain

ipformation could not be used, sinde the taps were the only source.

OSWALD's very bad Russian was the example he used. I asked

what opinion Mrs. OSWALD had of her husband's Russiak. She!

thought that he spoke it very well.

7, Mr. Slawson asked if the retranslation of the Dorticos - Armas

conversation could be made available to him by the end of hist weck.

(201-240720)

1 1 8

According to Mr. Slawsor, the Cormission Staftihad come

4p with' the ided that Silvia DURAN might be invited to the United

States, ostensibly, to be interxiewed by a periodical, and then

questioned by the Commission. The Chief Justice turned down the

proposal at once, on the ground that she was a Communist and

U,S. - Mexican relations might be damaged. This idea has beet

abandoned.

9 From Mr,. Slawson's remarks it is evident that the

preparation of the Commission's report has begun, and is in its

initial stages

10. Mr. (Whitten called me after the meeting to say that the

work of retranslating the Dorticos-Armas conversation from the

tape had started.
