Dear Ms. Denk:
Re: Response to CIA-12
The following is responsive to ARRB Request CIA-12.

The Agency has made a thorough search of its files
systems in an attempt to find files on the individuals noted
in referent request, namely, Ron Cross, Doug Gumpton, Bart
Henry, and Ted Shackley, particularly as their Agency
employment /association related to their service with JMWAVE.
The following files were located and have been reviewed, or
made available for review, by ARRB staff:

a. Cross, Ron -- An Office of Personnel Security
file was found but, with research, it was determined that
the subject of the file was not the Ron Cross sought by the
search.

b. Henry, Bart -- No files were found on “Bart
Henry,” which apppears to be an alias or pseudonym. Also,
no information was found to the name being registered as an
alias or pseudonym.

c. Gumpton, Doug -- Gumpton is an alias which was
used by retired Agency employee William M. Kent; Kent‘s
personnel file is in the JFK microfilm; the search found
both his official Office of Personnel and Office of Security
files.

d. Sanchez Morales, David -- Subject’s Personel and
Security files are located within the JFK collection at JFK
Box 244, Folder 23 and microfilm (box 64) Box 57, Folder 11
respectively. :

e. Shackley, Theodore G. Jr. -- Subject's official
Office of Personnel file; employee payroll file; official
Retirement file; and, Office of Security file were located.



This completes CIA action on referent request. If you
have any questions, please call me.

Sincerely,

aan ay om polis
dg. Barry Harrel

Bonnie:
This is with respect to your 26 February 1998 note wherein you asked that we check HRM for personnel files on Ron Cross, Bart
Henry and William Morris Kent. In an effort to bring the status of this particular tasking (C1A-IR-12) up-to-date, | provide the following:

‘My records show that on 18 July 1997 Barry requested that we conduct file searches on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross, Bart Henry and
Doug Gupton. We were advised by Barry, and as outlined in a 22 May 1996 letter from ARRB to John Pereira, that Cross, Henry and
Gupton are pseudonyms used by CIA personnel who testified to the HSCA.

Notwithstanding, we tasked OPS and HRM to conduct searches on these individuals in an effort to locate files. On 22 December 1996,
| advised Barry that HRM had located files on Ted Shackley and would provide them to Barry via this office once they arrived from RC. It
is my understanding that Becky gave you the OPF yesterday. HRM advsied further that they had attempted to locate files on Cross,
Henry and Gupton but failed to locate any files on these individuals in light of the fact that only the pseudos had been provided. We
further advised that if in the future you have access to the true names, we will glady search again.

On 23 December 1997, | advised Barry that:QPS had located files on Tat-ShackeP>RGRBERSANAAmigupton and that the files were
in OPS for review. They were unable to locate a record ag, ismmy understanding that you have not reviewed these files to
date but are in the process of making arsang x [____ Phducted the search back in July and | am certain that bn
she will be glad to you in this mattp ch

And lastly, | have no record of ever having received a request to search on:Williamr Morris‘Kent. Accordingly, | will request OPS and
HRM to do so.

Please let me know if | have misinterpreted the status of this request. Thank you. Frieda

CIA.
We discussed the following formal requests:

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board
and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to
do nothing further at this time.
CIA-2-5 Complete .
CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)
CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could
be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the
records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.

CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will
compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then
determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that
should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the “Blakey
version” as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the
documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the
staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.
CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and
will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests
where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make
histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review
histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not
discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,
within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to
make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further
discussions.
Cram’s multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram‘s
history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board
staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board
staff awaits its being made available.
CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)
CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.
CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)
The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as
they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on
recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make
records available within two weeks.

CIA-11 (Duran’s original statement)
