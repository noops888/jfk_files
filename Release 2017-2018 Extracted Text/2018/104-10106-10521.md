"I. A CIA report of 1961 lists him as a UN correspondent

then planning an unsponsored trip to East Germany, Poland,

Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Dutch corespondents said that they

had yet to see a story written by him. When he applied for

membership in the UN correspondents' association, he was unable

to produce a single clipping in support of the application. He

travels extensively. He has excellent contacts in all Commnist

countries including Cuba.

"g. The Hague Post of 15 April1951, with a nationwide

readership, characterized OLIMANS as an intimate friend of the

then President of Indonesia, SUKARNO, and as having tried for

five years to arrange contacts for SUKARNO in Holland.

"b. An FBI report of 24 November 1961 restates the above

and adds that he had been separated or divorced from his American

wife 18 months earlier because the is not a man'. He was living

with a male at the time of the report.

"i. An FBI report of 1 February 1962 includes an interview

with the ex-wife, Frieda BIELING (she had remarried). She said

that her ex-husband and President SUKARNO were close friends and

that he wrote to SUKARNO at least once a week throughout their

marriage. Around 1957 she and OLIMANS lived at the Paramount Hotel,

New York, for a time.

The Indonesian government paid their bill,

which was more than $300. She met SUKARIO through her husband in May 1959

in Copenhagen. At the time of the introduction SUKARNO cleared the

room of all advisors and bodyguards, then said to her, 'So you are

Frieda.

He told her that he

Looked forwar

to receiving his weekly messages from her husband that he always

read them just before he went to sleep while he was in bed." She said

that ten minutes after her wedding ceremony with OLIMANS was over,

she was alone.

Her father, she said, learned that OLIMANS had

police record for molesting young boys in Amsterdam. She obtained a

Mexican divorce in 1960. SheÂ®
