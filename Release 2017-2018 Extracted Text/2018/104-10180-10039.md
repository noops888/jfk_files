conn Hale MUNCON, born 1905, reildent of Loc

angeles, approached LICOYET/l in 190, claiming he

cepresented a large group of Cuban exiles in the Los

Angeles area. MUNSON asked LICO FT/1 about the location

of training camps, etc. LICO.ET/1 reported the discussion

to station Mexico City and wa, instructed to avoid MUNSON.

Donn Hale NUNSON is probably identical with the bonn MUNSON

wiro authored the saga article. There are no additional

identifiable traces on MUNSON.

2. There arc numerous traces on Juan BUIAG: Aizcorbe,

he onner of the weapons plant named in the lage article.

The Fel also reported erruinod was involved in the sale of

arme to Cuban revolucionarics in 1965. although RI was Un

ible to locute the repore, it was classicied to Manolo it's

any weapons supplied by ENQUIAGA's flen went to the JURE

attention almost two months ago.

Plot"

15 a hin to recolved from an inasde contact which was

brought to him by someone oxiting Cuba.

Ray considers the

insido contact roliable but prefors not to identify him.

Ray has not been ablo to determine if the inside contact

Is porsonally in contact, or can arrange contact, with the

• Mig Pilot who reportedly

is fed up with

the situation in

Cuba and plans to defoct with his airplane whenever he hag

an opportunity.

Tho "tip" Ray received was to this effect

1.0.1

that there is a Mix Pilot who is disenchanted and

plans to defect with his plane.

One point Ray

was specific

on was that the plane was described as

"one of the snaller

Migs"

and according to Ray it 1s not a Mlg-21.

After Ray's original contacts with AMBADGER on this

subject (wherein

the plane was apparently crroneously

identified as a MIG-21) Ray claims he sent a message to the

insido contact requesting the complete details we had asked

Ile has received no reply.

In response to my request

at the meeting on 13 October 1966 he told me at our subsequent

meeting on 15 October that he attempted to reach his inside

contact by phone but was unsuccessful.

He was urged to

continuo until he reached the party and to obtain as much

detail on this matter as possible so we could hopefully

clarify the situation.

He assurred me he would follow-through

on this and report to

AMBADGER.

(It seemed protty obvious to

me after two discussions with Ray on this subject that he has

no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on

Plot" and consequently may never be able to verify

the original "tip" and obtain further details.

We both agreed that if

Internal Contacts.

d.

One gets the impression that RIY lives

somewhat removed from the actual realities of the

Cuban internal situation.

He has a tendener to

compare

the internal situation today with that

which

existed in Satista's time when he (RIT) ras

one of the leaders of the 26th of July underground

resistance movement in Habana.

RAY maintains

direct personal contact with many new arrivals

seeking asylum both in Puerto Rico and the U.S.

and also undoubtedly receives a certain anount of

general information and gossip from other JURE

contacts and

supporters.

He claims to have many

triends

and former associates inside, which is

probably true, but does not have any regular or

secure means to communicate with them.

It appears

obvious that these friends and contacts are not

working together, if at all,

and that he has no

cohesive resistance

group or force as such inside.

I questioned hin about several personalities

such as Carlos Franqui,

Pedro Miret,

and others.

He had no specific information

on their activities in recent months but said he

"could get it if you mant it."

point, it would appear that RAY and the JURE pain-

tain no regular contact with any internal "supporters";

that he undoubtedly still has many former friends

and supporters inside but just what they nould do

or how far they would go--to support him is a moot

question.

JURE Propaganda Activitios.

The JURE, Manolo RAY, Emilio Guede, and

others, have a half-hour weekly program which is

carried on 4 different Puerto Rican radio stations

between 6:30-7:30 PM

This program,

news and events in Cuba,

arrived refugees the program

and other items of current interest

is composed without cost

and all radio time on the 4 stations is donated free

". cated and

motivated towards secking the overthrou

of the Castro government: He has a realistic outlook

to a considerable degree, although as mentioned in

paragraph d., above, his viewpoints on the reality

of the internal situation in present day Cuba are

somewhat naive.

As an experienced resistance organizer

and fighter in the 26th of July movement against

Batista, he knows the value of propaganda in preparing

the general populace for resistance.

He also knows

that propaganda is useless and counterproductive

without follow-up positive results. He speaks of

continuing his local radio broadcasts (which he

readily admits are useful only to maintain some

spirit amongst the exiles for possible future use),

and at some later date--he has no timetable-hopes

to obtain facilities in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, or

some other site where he can beam broadcasts into Cuba.

His intention being to follow-up the broadcasts with

action.

He speaks again of clandestine entry

into

Cuba himself to contact sources within, prove to

people that there is a resistance movement, and to

form a nucleus for later

action.

He openly admits

the blunder of his last "publicized" return and that

if it is done

again it must be completely clandestine

and unannounced.

He seems to have no fear of returning

and claims he still has plenty of friends who would

hide and help him.

He made an off-hand reference to

the Agency furnishing him assistance to enter clan-

destinely at some future date.

He was told that his

sources in Miami surely knew of several "family run"

operations which could take him

successfully to Cuba

if and when he was ready to return.

Financial Situation.

g.

RAY made no request for financial assistance

and from all indications is doing fairly well in his

local business.

RAY plans to travel to the U.S. incrly November for

about two weeks and said he would visit JURE representatives

in several large

cities, including D.C.

He will be

in touch

with AMBADGER

who will be vacatloning in the U.S.

and hopefully they will be able to get together with

the writer while in D.C.

In any event, RAY obviously likes,

respects and accepts AMBADGER as our go-between

and I believe he will keep AMBADGER posted on most of his

Manolo RAY,

as exiles go, certainly seems like one

of the better of the

lot and contact on the scene by AMBADGER

on a regular basis should be adequate to keep up with his

activities.

Occasional contact by an Agency staff officer,

could be useful in keeping AUBADGER's relationship

fully alive.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: MAnOlU RAY / FiLe

1. During a brief TDY stopover at Headquarters on 23 August 1966.

OUSPORT -I said he had talked with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto Rico

on 22 Auguel.

According to QUSPORT-I, RAY had no additional pertinent

information concerning hie alleged inside contacts or his recent meeting

with Garcia Bango in Madrid, Spain. RAY continues to insist that he has

inside support in Cuba and contacts who are anti-regime and prepared

to assist him when needed. He did not reveal to QUSPORT-I, however,

who the pecple were or where they are located.

2. RAY told QUSPORT -I that he wanted very much to see the writer

concerning a delicate operational matter. When pressed by QUSPORT -!

RAY said he had access to a MIG pilot in Cuba who was ready and anxious

to leave Cuba and was willing to fly out a MIG aircrall. RAY did not

mention the name or location of the pilot or the model MIG aircraft he was

Neither did he discuss his ways and means of communication with

the pilot and how he had determined the pilot's intentions to defect with

RAY told QUSPORT he wanted to discuss the matter with the

He admitted that a MIG aircraft might not now have as much value

to the U.S. because of the rocent access to i MIG-2l in Isreal but that it

would have tremendous propaganda value it a Cuban pilot defected and

brought out a MIG. He said he particularly wanted to discuss the matter

with the writer because if the operation were successful he did not want

Slanuel Artime and the MRR or any other exile group taking credit. He

wanted to make sure that he and his group received all the propaganda

advantage which he would in turn exploit internally as further evidence to

his supporters inside that the JURE was active on the island. RAY in the

latter part u the conversation on this subject when he learned QUSPORT -I

was coming to Washington the following day, asked him to check with the

writer to determine it it was OK for him (RAY) to discuss this subject with

AMBADGER. (AMBADGER is the man who was recently introduced 8o RAY

n San Juan by Harry Mahoney as the man who would insure that any

information RAY wanted passed en the Agency would reach them.) OUSPOR'

to!d RAY that if he did not receive a phone call from him before the evening

0f 20 Auguse he should give AMBADGER all the detaila.

3. I told QUSPORT to phune RAY and assure him that I wanted

him to pass all the details to AMBADGER even though according 8o

QUSPORT-l's arrangement this was not neressary. QUSPORT-I was

unable, however, la reach RAY by phone during the afternoon of

20 August.

.?. About 8 p.m. on 20 August I receired a collect phone call

from AMBADGER from San Juan. AMBADGER was very excited and

said he had to see me right away. After he settled down a bit he fold

me he had just left RAY and his two local lieutenants Emilio GUEDE

and Arturo VILLAR (the so-called triumvirate of the JURE). He said

RAY had contacted him and the four of them discussed the possibility

of defecting a Cuban MIG pilot and having him bring out his plane. In

essence and from what I could discuss over the phone the details were

substantially the same as those given to me by QUSPORT -1 earlier in

the day. AMBADGER said he needed my guidance right away and

further urged me to come to San Juan to discuss the matter with RAY

who was pressing AMBADGER to see me. He said he had agreed to see

RAY latter that night. I told AMBADGER I could not make the trip in

the next few days and that further there were a few basic facts I needed

to convince me that RAY really had the potential to pull off the operation.

I told AMBADGER to ser RAY later that evening and to try and determine

the following:

a. Name of the MIG pilot.

b. Military field where he is stationed.

c. Type MiG he flys.

d. RAY's commo if any with the pilot.

e. Estimated timing for the defection, i. e., has the pilor

indicated he was ready to deiect and awaiting instructions,

etc.

I asked AMBADGER to phone me if he could develop any further

information. AMBADGER phoned Mr. Mahoney on the afternoon of

24 Auguse to report he had altempted to obtain further details from RAY

following his conversations with the writer bur that RAY had replied he

did not know the name of the pilot or other details of the operation.
