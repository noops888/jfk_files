MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: (Operational Meetings with Monolo Ray Yue

. 1, Manolo Ray arrived in Washington, D.C., by air
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 20 March 1967 on a personal
business trip, At the request of AMBADGER he phoned the
writer and we met for approximately 1} hours in the bar
of the Hotel Ambassador in downtown Washington. This
meeting was followed by a luncheon meeting oa 21 March
at the Occidental Restaurant. Ray returned to San Juan
on 22 March, Thé Following are the highlights of our
conversations.

a. Ray claims he has “lost access" wit?
the MI& pilot whom he had previously reported
4 as a defection target. He no longer has any
i” means of contacting him or of knowing his
present whereabouts or attitude,

b. He claimed he does not have any
direct communication--or access--to any
significant military or government officials
in the Castre regime.

¢, He still maintains his half hour radio
’ broadcast over Puerto Rican radio stations, This
‘ program is prepared by his people and the radio
time donated so the cost is minimal,

ad. Although he maintains contact with
active members of his "movement" they have no
present or projected plans for "action" except
in the propaganda field.

e, His business in the prefabricated
housing field is progressing satisfactorily.
et He has obtained private financing to start a

: prefab plant in Santo Domingo and recently
visited Panama where the prospects are good,

2. Future Plans:

a. Ray mentioned that his organization
plans to send a representative to Mexico City

e before the end of March to talk to Gustavo
Arcos’ sister who recently left Cuba, Ray is

anxious to do everything possible to assist
Arcos in obtaining his freedom but udmitted
he had no commo or means of making contact
with him in prison,

b. Ray is interested in expanding his
propaganda radio broadcasts, He spoke in terms
of renting time on a U.S, short wave station
:to beam broadcasts, to Cuba. This would be
done at his own expense, He also mentioned
that during Reid's former administration in

j the Dominican Republic he had been promised

\ a site and permission to set up a short wave
station. for Cuban broadcasts, He may explore
this possibility with Balaguer's present
government during one of his business trips
to the DR, I suggested he sound out other
stations in L,A, to see if he could get sone
free time and replay for hig Puerto Rican
material and have since mailed him via

‘ AMBADGER a list of stations in L.A, who are

known to have accepted and used other Cuban
oxile tape broadcasts. At my suggestion he
prepared a brief outline of what he would
like to do in the radio/propaganda field
and what he would hope to accomplish.

3. _ Ray mentioned that he thought someone should
utilize Pardo Llada, who now lives and vorks on a
newspaper in Cali, Colombia, in propaganda activity
against Castro.

4. He did not ask or hint for any financial
assistance for his organization,

5. We discussed briefly the Olympic Games to be held
in Winnipeg, Canada, this summer, AMBADGER had asked him
to bring up the subject. I told him in essence that ve

} were not interested in inducing the defection of any
athletes but that if he received any information indicating
that any of the Cuban officials attending the games might
be disaffected we would be interested in checking out any

leads. :
6. In general Ray was as usual pleasant, friendly
and talkative, It is evident that he is now ~oncentrating

on earning a living for himself and his family. However,
at the same time he maintains a keen interest in Cuban

ready and willing to help in any major plans if and
when they should ever materialize. F

in Puerto Rico by AMBADGER who Ray speaks. highly of and
is pleased with the handling arrangement.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meetings with Manolo Ra: San Juan, Puerto Rico
13 and 15 October 191 .

MIG-21--Dofecting Pilot--ct al.

1 In lengthy discussions on this point it developed

that Ray has been unable to obtain any more pertinent infor-
mation since he first called the matter to ANBADGER's ssantenastnaaite
attention almost two months ago, The basis of the "Mig
Plot" is a tip he received from an inside contact which was
brought to him by someone cxiting Cuba. Ray considers the

insido contact reliable but prefers not to identify him.
Ray has not been ablo to determine if the inside contact

is personally in contact, er can arrange contact, with the
Mig Pilot who reportedly is fed up with the situation in
Cuba and plans to defoct with his airplane whenever he has
an opportunity. The "tip" Ray received was to this effect

.0., that there is a Mig Pilot who is disenchanted and
plans to defect with hin plane. One point Ray was specific
on was that the plane was described as "one of the smaller 7 A
Migs" and according to Ray it is not a Mig-21.

2, After Ray's original contacts with AMBADGER on this
subject (wherein the plano was apparently crroneously
identified as a MIG-21) Ray claims he sent a’message to the
inside contact requesting the complete details we had asked
for, He has received no reply, In response to my request
at the meeting on 13 Octoher 1966 he told me at our subsequent
meeting on 15 October that he attempted to reach his inside
contact by phone but was unsuccessful. He was urged to
continuo until he reached the party and to obtain as much
detail on this matter as possible so we could nopefully
clarify the situation. He assurred me he would follow-through
on this and report to AMBADGER. (It seemed protty obvious to
me after two discussions with Ray on this subject that he has
no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on
the "Mig Plot" and consequently may never be able to verify
the original "tip" and obtain further details.

3. In any event I outlined for him in general the
U.S, Government interest in obtaining a modern version of
the MIG-21 and the financial and other rewards available
to a pilot who would bring one out. I emphasized that any
activity along this line would have to be strictly Ray's
and ‘the JURE's operation and dono through his contacts
and sources reiterating again that therefore it was essential
that ho confirm the plane, model, pilot, etc. reported to
him to dotormino if the operation was feasible.

We spent sometime discussing his “image” both
ciciae “cuba and with the exiles. He agreed that at the
present time it could hardly be lower and something rather
dramatic was needed to improve it, We both agreed that if
he could pull off a successful operation to defect a MIG-22
pilot with his plane it would do much to restore his and

the JURE's name and prestige.

Ss. Although Ray is obviously far removed from the
action agent (the pilot), if such exists, the idea of the
operation intrigues him and he will undoubtedly do everything
he can to stimulate some action. Any further information
developed by him will be forwarded to us through AMBADGER.

25 October 1966

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

1, The following are the highlights of meetings held
with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto, Rico, on 13 and 15
October 1966, The matter of the possible defection of a
MIG-pilot previously reported by RAY has been covered in
a separate memorandum:

Personal Situation:

a. RAY has an engineering and planning office
in San Juan which he shares with Emilio Guede,
a personal friend and JURE colleague who is in the
publicity business, RAY said he just signed a
contract for the planning of a commercial develop-
ment site in San Juan, from which he will realize
several thousand dollars profit. His principal
(and pet) project is the promotion and attempt to
raise through private funds the financing of a
plant to mass produce low-cost prefabricated housing
designed by him, He claims with an investment of
$200,000 he can mass produce prefabricated homes to
sell for $3,000 which would be ideal for Puerto

Rico's needs.

Recent Trip to Santo Domingo:

b. RAY said his recent trip to Santo Domingo
was strictly for business purposes, He hopes to
start a small project in Santo Domingo to produce
prefabricated housing. The small project he has
in mind can get underway with an expenditure of
$80,000, which he feels confident can be raised
in Santo Domingo. He said he naturally talked with
some people in the government about Cuba and the
JURE, but that the government must become stronger
and more confident before there would be any possi-
bility of obtaining their assistance--or blessing--
in conducting any activities against Cuba.

MIG-21, Defecting Pilot, et al,

c. This matter has been covered in a separate

memorandum,



Internal

d. One gets the impression that RAY lives
somewhat removed fron the actual realities of the
Cuban internal situation, He has a tendency to
compare the internal situation today with that
which existed in Batista'’s time when he (RAY) was
one of the leaders of the 26th of July underground
resistance movement in Habana, RAY maintains
direct personal contact with many new arrivals
seeking asylum both in Puerto Rico and the U.S.
and also undoubtedly receives a certain anount of
general information and gossip from other JURE
contacts and supporters. He claims to have many
friends and former associates inside, which is
probably true, but dees not have any regular or
secure means to communicate with them, It appears
obvious that these friends and contacts are not
working together, if at all, and that he has no
cohesive resistance group or force as such inside.

I questioned him about several personalities
such as Carlos Frangui, Pedro Miret, Emilio Aragones,
and others. He had no specific information at all
on their activities in recent months but said he
"could get it if you want it." In summary on this
point, it would appear that RAY and the JURE main-
tain no regular contact with any internal "supporters";
that he undoubtedly still has many former friends
and supporters inside but just what they would do-~
or how far they would go--to support him is a moot
question.

JURE Propaganda Activities,

e. The JURE, Manolo RAY, Emilio Guede, and
others, have a half-hour weekly program which is
carried on 4 different Puerto Rican radio stations
between 6:30-7:30 PM each Sunday, This progran,
which is taped in advance, features commentaries on
news and events in Cuba, interviews with recently
arrived refugees, and other items of current interest
regarding Cuba. ‘The program is composcd without cost
and all radio time on the 4 stations is donated free

of charge.

i)


Future Plars.

f. RAY is a man who ts relaxed, is now engaged
in making a legitimate livelihood for himself, his
wife and three children but still seriously dedi-
‘cated and motivated towards secking the overthrow

of the Castro government, He has a realistic outlook
to considerable degree, although as mentioned in
paragraph d., above, his viewpoints on the reality
of the internal situation in present day Cuba are
somewhat naive, As an experienced resistance organizer
and fighter in the 26th of July movement against
Batista, he knows the value of propaganda in preparing
the general populace for resistance. He also knows
that propaganda is useless and counterproductive
without, follow-up positive results, He speaks of
continuing his local radio broadcasts (which he
readily admits are useful only to maintain some
spirit amongst the exiles for possible future use),
and at some later date--he has no timetable--hopes

to obtain facilities in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, or
some other site where he can beam broadcasts into Cuba,
His intention being to follow-up the broadcasts with
action, He speaks again of clandestine entry into
Cuba himself to contact sources within, prove to
people that there is a resistance movement, and to
form a nucleus for later action. He openly admits
the blunder of his last "publicized" return and that
if it is done again it must be completely clandestine
and unannounced, He seems to have no fear of returning
and claims he still has plenty of friends who would
hide and help him, He made an off-hand reference to
the Agency furnishing him assistance to enter clan-
destinely at some future date, He was told that his
sources in Miami surely knew of several'"family run”
operations which could take him successfully to Cuba
if and when he was ready to return,

Financial Situation,
&. RAY made no request for financial assistance

and from all indications is doing fairly well in his
local business,

2. RAY plans to travel to the U.S, inmrly November for

about two weeks and said he would visit JURE representatives

in several large cities, including D.C.

He will be in touch



Lawes

2asg

with AMBADGER who will be vacationing in the U.S, at that
time and hopefully they will be able to get together with
the writer while in D.C. In any event, RAY obviously likes,
respects and accepts AMBADGER as our go-b2tween in San Juan
and I believe he will keep AMBADGER posted on most of his

\ activities,

3. Manolo RAY, as exiles go, certainly seems like one
of the better of the lot and contact on the scene by AMBADGER
2 on a regular basis should be adequate to keep up with his
i activities, Occasional contact by an Agency staff officer,
however, could be useful in keeping AMBADGER's relationship
fully alive,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

/) FEE

SUBJECT; Manolo RAY.

1. During a brief TDY stopover at Headquarters on 23 August 1966,
QUSPORT-1 said he had talked with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto Rico
on 22 August. Accotding to QUSPORT-1, RAY had no additional pertinent
information concerning his alleged inside contacts or hie recent meeting
with Garcia Bango in Madrid, Spain. RAY continues to insist that he has
inside support in Cuba and contacts who are anti-regime and prepared
to assist him when needed. He did not reveal to QUSPORT-1, however,
whe the pecple were or where they are located.

2. RAY told QUSPORT-I that he wanted very much to see the writer
concerning a delicate operational matter, When pressed by QUSPORT-1
RAY said he had access to a MIG pilot in Cuba who was ready and anxious
to leave Cuba and was willing to fly out a MIG aircraft. RAY did not
mention the name or location of the pilot or the model MIG aircraft he was
flying. Neither did he discuss his ways and means of cornmunication with
the pilot and how he had determined the pilot's intentions to defect with
his airplane. RAY told QUSPORT he wanted to discuss the matter with the
writer. He admitted that a MIG aircraft might not now have as much value
to the U.S. because of the recent access to a MIG-2l in Isreal but that it
would have tremendous propaganda value if a Cuban pilot defected and
brought out a MIG. He said he particularly wanted to discuss the matter
with the weiter because if the operation were successful he did not want
Manuel Artime and the MRR or any other exile group taking credit, He
wanted to make sure that he and his group received all the propaganda
advantage which he would in turn exploit internally as further evidence to
his supporters inside that the JURE was active on the island, RAY in the
latter part vi the conversation on this subject when he learned QUSPORT-1
was conting to Washington the following day, asked him to check with the
writer to determine if it was OK for him (RAY) to discuss this subject with
AMBADGER. (AMBADGER is the man who waa recently introduced to RAY
an San Juan by Harry Mahoney as the man whe would insure that any
information RAY wanted passed to the Agency would reach them.) QUSPORT
told RAY that if he did not receive a phone call from him before the evening
of 20 August he should give AMBADGER all the details.

3. Ttold QUSPORT to phone RAY and assure him that I wanted
him to pass all the details to AMBADGER even though according to
QUSPORT-1's arrangement this was not necessary. QUSPORT-I was
unable, however; to reach RAY by phone during the afternoon of

20 August.

-4. About 8 p,m, on 20 August I received a collect phone call
from AMBADGER from San Juan. AMBADGER was very excited and
said he had to sce me right away. After he settled down a bit he told
me he had just left RAY and his two local lieutenants Emilio GUEDE
and Arturo VILLAR (the so-called triumvirate of the JURE): He said
RAY had contacted him and the four of them discussed the possibility
of defecting a Cuban MIG pilot and having him bring out his plane. In
easence and from what I could discuss over the phone the details were
substantially the same as those given to me by QUSPORT-! earlier in
the day, AMBADGER said he needed my guidance right away and
further urged me to come to San Juan to discuss the matter with RAY
who was pressing AMBADGER to see me. He said he had agreed to see
RAY latter that night. I told AMBADGER I could not make the trip in
the next few days and that further there were a few basic facts Ineeded
to convince me that RAY really had the potential to pull off the operation,
I told AMBADGER to see RAY later that evening and to try and determine
the following:

a, Name of the MIG pilot.
b, Military field where he is stationed.

c. Type MIG he flys.

d, RAY'a commo if any with the pilot.

e. Estimated timing for the defection, i,e., has the pilot
indicated he was ready to defect and awaiting instructions,

ete,

asked AMBADGER to phone me if he could develop any further
information, AMBADGER phoned Mr. Mahoney on the afternoon of

24 August to report he had attempted to obtain further details from RAY
following his conversations with the writer but that RAY had replied he
did not know the name cf the pilot or other details of the operation. (See

Mr. Mahoney's memo attached)

MEWORANDUY FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: HIG 21

roxinately 2030 hours on 23 August 1966
1] called me to report that he had just
receive € ¥ AMBADGER from San Juan, Puetto Rico.

AMBADGER had a report from AMBANG that agents of his inside
Cuba were prepared to fly a MIG 21 to the United States.

ked AMBADGER for more information but AMBANG
claimed that he did not have any additional details. (In
view of AMBANG’s previvus reluctance to source his tnformation
there te always a certal epticism about AMBANG's claims
6f accomplishments.) told AMBADGER to find out
from AMBANG the who, where, Why, what, when, and how and to
report back, AMBANG etated that he did not have this in-
formation but they planned to go ahead with the operation.
told him that 1f a Cuban pilot wanted to fly a
WIG 2T to the U.S. ve could do nothing to stop him.

2. At 1400 hours on DGER called ne to
report that he had discussed Buggestions with
AMBANG who had replied that he honestly didn't know the name
of the pilot or the details of the operation, In short, ne
had been informed by a contact of his in Cuba that some of
hie people were going to steal a MIG 21. (AMBAOGER com-
mented that AMBANG did not appear to be evasive or reluctant
to discuss the mstter but apparently didn't know tho details.)
In any event, AMBANG stated that they were going ahead with
the operation and planned to “do some dasage” before they
left and AMBADGER asked for ay approval. I told\AMBADGER
that I couldn't approve anything like that and thought that
the chance of losing the aircraft outweighed the possible
gain, 1 suggeated that if they were going ahead with the
Operation anyway 1t would be of more value to just yet the j
Sircraft, AMBADGER replted that AMBANG appeared adaaant in
this respect and wanted to be certain that if the operation
was successful that he be allowed to take all the credit for
it. I replied that 1f in fact he was responsible for the
Operation he could have all the credit,

3. I have called Lt. Col. Norman H. Stuzer, Yellow
Sands Officer, U.8, Air Force, extension 3207 and informed
him that there is the "possibility" of a MIG 21 pilot. de~
fecting to the U.S, in his aircraft, He in turn has
alerted the Southeast Air Defense Command who will te on
the alert for auch a poasibility,
