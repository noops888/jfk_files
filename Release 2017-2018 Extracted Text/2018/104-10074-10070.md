ATL-4-75, 14 January 1975, same subject

1. On 13 February 1975, Special Agent (fou) Austin of the Special
Investigations office of the US Bureau of Customs Atlanta office
(Phone: (404) 526-7731) called and wanted to speak to the writer of
this memorandum. We were out of town at the tise and he asked the
secretary, who took his call, to have us return his call Tuesday norning
(18 February) when we returned. Wa called him back the morning of

18 February.

2. Mr. Austin sald that the reason he was calling waa with regard
to a contact he had had froma friend of “Den Williamson” (the individual
who had called our Agency and vho was the subject of the above-raferenced
memorandum). The information that Austin had to impart was essentially
as follows:

3. Williamson's friend, whe was the one that Willfameon called us
about with regard to information on the shipment of arms and the impending
overthrow of a foreign country (see citad mexorandum), had contacted Austin
and asked that Austin try to set up a meeting between hin (¥illiamson's
friend) and us (Austin and Petersen). He had prowided Austin with our naz
and phone number which had been given him by Wilifmeson. We told Austin
that we had only talked with Williamson one time—on the phone—when
Willismeon had sought to set up a aseting between us and bis friend, and
that we had never met Willianson’s friend and knew nothing about him other
than what Williamson had told us on the phone. We told Austin that we had
givea our name and offics phone nusber to Williamson because Williamson
had said his friend would like to get in touch with us, and further told
him that siece that time (7 January 1975) we had had no call frem him-—-which,
wa said, seesed strange for someone apparently so eager to contact os, We
inforzed Austin that we often get crank calls and we don't just go around
meating with people who call up on some weird subject. We said that we were
sorry now that we had ever given Williamson oor number. We also told Austin
that the type of information that Williauson apoke of—shipment of arms to
other countries—wss something entirely outaide our area of jurisdiction,
and that should Williausoa's friend call or had he called we would suge
that he provida his information to the FBI.

4, Austin sald that Williamson, hinsalf, had not been in toueh with
him. We understood Austin to say that Willianson’s friend was a past
informer. Austin said that the lasr time he had talked with him ha had
told Austin about a ‘super dope deal’ that apparently Customs was never 1
able to confirm. Austin described him as one who seams to have “flights
of faney,” and at one point in bis couversation with us ha said, “I'm
really a little leary of the guy." According to what Austin said, 7
Williamson's friend had told him that “they' (whoever “they” may be) were
running guns into Nicaragua and inte Mexico supposedly through the Port
of Laredo, Texas. Austin said that they had had peopla doing sone
checking at Laredo and so far nothing had checked out.

5. Williamson's friend had told Austin that he “was only going to
do this (provide information) for the money,” and mofety was discussed.
hem the figure of $50,000 vasa brought up, Williamson's friend indignantly
told Austia words to the effect: “I can go te the CIA and they will pay
me wore than that just for rhe information.”. When Austin told him ta go
ahead, Williamson's friend said “Well, as a matter of fact, this friend of
wine (apparently referring te Williamson) already has." Then he asked
that Austin a3 a favor act as a go-between and set up a meeting for him
with us. All of which led to Austin’s calling ua. Wa reiterated ro
Auatin that ve had no desire to meet with Williangon's friend. Wa hope ha
wilh get the mesaage and that will be the end of this waste of tine.

&. We explained to Austia our aission aa collectors of foreign
information, and Austin said that if anything should turn up that would be
of legitimate interest to us he would let us know. Austin was very
frieadly throughout. and we thanked him as a matter of courtesy for having
gene to the trouble of contacting us.
