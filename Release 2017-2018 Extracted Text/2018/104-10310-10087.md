February 25, 1976-

REVIEW STAFF:

Laid Mr. Elder: Cease

This is to ‘confirm our discussion of February 20

regarding the deposition of certain requests of the Select

Committee: .

qa) With regard to the Comaittee* s letter of February 6,

and CIA’s letter response 76-0200/1 of February 11, I asked

that a further attempt be made to identify the initials
“G.N.N.“. Those’ initials follow handwritten comments on a

- March 1965. document in the AMLASH file which proposed giving

the Cuban government information which might compromise
AMLASH. ‘ :

(2) With regard to the Committee's letter of January
12 and CIA's letter response 76- 0062/1 of- February 11, I
asked that CIA review its files.on Osvaldo Dorticos, Presi-~
dent of Cuba, to determine if the message received by Dr.
Portell-Villa was placed in those files.

(3) Dan’ Dwyer and I reviewed the list of CIA person-
nel at the Mexico City station referenced in CIA's letter 76-
0083/3 of February 11 and agreed the list should remain at

Z the Agency.

{4) I requested the Select | Committee be provided the
current address and telepho e number: of Mr." John Whiten, the
Desk Chief for Mexico in 1963. :

“) With regard to the Committee's letter of January
29, requesting that two current Agency employees be made
available for interviews, we agreed the Agency should provide
the Committee-a letter stating whether .or not these ° ME
were readily available for interviews. TS iH

Mr. Walter Elder
Page Tvo

() Tan Dwyer and I reviewed Agency originated
documezzts in CIA's 201 File on Gilberto: Policarpo Lopez.
It is cur «derstanding you would reconsider CIA's decision to

deny. the Cecomittee's request for a copy of these documents.

(7) With regard to the Committee's letter of January 30,
we agreed: -

fa) We would for the time being narrow the request
in parégraph 1 to include only contacts of Director McCone;

(b>) We would not alter the requests in paragraphs
2 and 3. - a

I trust this summary accords with your understanding of
our discussion,. but please let me know if there is any
misunderstending. :

Sincerely,

Vid ee

James H." Johnston
