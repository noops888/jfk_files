SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN

(SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER)

Reference is made to my letter of January 30, 1975, setting

forth information in the "Sullivan memoranda." Your attention is invited

to specifically Item 8 of this letter. This item is made up of two paragraphs.

The first paragraph states that President Johnson asked the FBI to look

into members of Senator Goldwater's staff and give him the results. A review

was made and results furnished some of which contains derogatory information.

We have located a work copy of a memorandum to Mr. DeLoach dated

October 26, 1964, captioned "NAME CHECK REQUEST FOR WHITE HOUSE."

This copy states that Bill Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, requested

a special check of the Bureau's files concerning persons employed in Senator

Goldwater's office. Using the United States Senate telephone directory, 15

individuals were listed*and a memorandum was attached reflecting the results

of the check. The recommendation was that Mr. De Loach furnish the memo-

randum to Mr. Moyers.

We are unable to locate a record copy of the above-described

memoranda. :

A record copy of & letter to Mr. Moyers dated October 27,

1964, is in file and was hand delivered by Mr. DeLoach on October 28, 1964.

This letter advised that there was no derogatory information in our files on

13 of the individuals mentioned. However, concerning Edward Kenneth Nelioi

who "has been, his traveling press secretary, the FBI received information

Item 8 also states that President Johnson on October 20,

Jenkins well; that Jenkins had traveled with Goldwater; that Jenkins was

familiar with Goldwater activities.

We have been able to locate a memorandum dated October 20,

1964, to Mr. Hoover from Assistant Director Cartha D. DeLoach. This

memorandum sets forth a conversation with President Johnson on October 19,

1964, on several matters including a great deal of discussion on the

"Walter Jenkins Affair." Portions of this memorandum contain the following

language, "The President stated Jenkins was cleared by Barry Goidwater's

squadron in 1958... the President stated that Goldwater would find it

Former White House Aide Charles W. Colson appeared on NBC's

he was supplied with information from the FBI about "one unfortunate

incident" in the life of George McGovern. He stated that this information

was received in 1971 or 1972.

A review of the files of the FBI concerning George S. McGovern

reveals information concerning one incident that is contained therein which

may be referred to as "one unfortunate incident." This information deals

A Information con-

cerning this incident was acquired and verified during a special inquiry

investigation which was initiated on December 8, 1960, at the request of

Lawrence F. O'Brien, assistant to then President-elect Kennedy.

This information, along with other information which was collected

during the course of this investigation, was disseminated to the White House

on December 27, 1960. The flies of the FBI reflect that no further dis-

semination of this information was made. The FBI files reflect that on

March 6, 1961, the Secret Service requested a name check concerning

McGovern. At that time Secret Service was advised that an applicant-type

investigation had been conducted during December, 1960, results of which

were finished in the white House and the secret service was referred to

COMMENTS MADE BY CHARLES W. COLSON ON THE

"TODAY" PROGRAM, FEBRUARY 7, 1975, CONCERNING

INFORMATION FURNISHED WHITE HOUSE BY THE FBI

ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY DURING

WORLD WAR II

The following is submitted for your information:

An article starting on page Al of the February 7, 1975,

issue of the Washington Star-News stated Charles W. Colson, former

White House Aide, appeared on NBC's "Today" program on February 7,

1975.

He stated while he was a White House Aide the FBI furnished

extensive information to the White House in 1971 or 1972 concerning

former President John F. Kennedy while he was with the United States

Navy during World War II. Colson stated it concerned information picked

up while the FBI was investigating a female Nazi agent. "Lieutenant

Kennedy was being followed by FBI Agents. " Colson characterized the data as

"personal gossip."

A review of our files discloses the matter referred to by

Colson apparently concerns the investigation of Mrs. Paul Fejos, nee

Inga Arvad, who was the subject of an Internal Security and Espionage -

German investigation conducted in the early 1940's. Mrs. Fejos first

came to our attention in November, 194, upon receipt of a letter from

a fellow student from Columbia University School of Journalism, New YOrK

City, which stated Fejos may well have been sent to the United States by

Germany to intluence morale.

A New York City Office report dated June 7,

1941, disclosed she had ceen friendly with Adolf Hitler and Herman Goering

in the 1930's. Mrs. Fejos appeared at our Washington Field Division on

December 12, 1941, along with representatives of the Washington Times Herald

to volunteer background regarding herself since it had been "rumored" she was

working for the German Propaganda Ministry. She was a friend of Kathleen

Kennedy, daughter of former Ambassador Joseph Kennedy. She was then writing

a column captioned "Did You Happen To See" for the Times Herald which included

personality sketches on persons interviewed by her. She admitted having

interviewed Hitler twice as well as Goebbels and Goering while employed

by a Danish newspaper in the 1930's. She denied she was an intelligence

agent. Her husband was employed by the Swedish financier Axel Wenner-Gren

and had been in Western Pan America in charge of a scientific expedition

for him.

On November 14, 1941, a fellow Times Herald reporter

advised a Bureau official she thought Mrs. Fejos was a "spy." «t

Allegatini.

On January 26, 1942, the Attorney General authorized installation

of an electronic surveillance of Mrs. Fejos. In addition, "F.D.R." sent a

confidential memorandum from the White House dated May 4, 1942, to

Mr. Hoover suggesting Inga Arvad should be "specially-watched" in view of

periodic contacts between John Kennedy and herself, the latest being in June,

1942. She obtained a Reno divorce from Paul Fejos i June 3, 1942, thereafter

using her maicen name Inga Arvad and moved to New York City August ?, 1942, 4

interviewed by Bureau Agents March 1 and 2, 1945, in New York City and Inga

Arvad was interviewed February 28, 1945, in Hollywood, California, concerning

the background, activities and associations with Axel Wenner-Gren who was

alleged to have been pro-German or pro-Nazi. The investigation of Mrs. Fejos

was closed in 1945 as no subversive activities had been uncovered.

The results of the 1945 interviews were furnished Assistant

Attorney General (War Division) Herbert Wechsler by memorandum dated

March 1, 1945, and captioned "Axel Wenner-Gren." Previously by memorandum

dated February 20, 1942, and captioned "Mrs. Paul Fejos nee Inga Arvad"

Mr. Edward J. Ennis, Director, Alien Enemy Control Unit, Department of

• Justice, was furnished information then known concerning Mrs. Fejos in response

to his request for same dated February 4, 1942. His purpose in requesting

same was to ascertain if a Presidential Warrant of Apprehension should be

issued. Memorandum dated August 13, 1942, also containing background

and activity data concerning Mrs. Fejos was forwarded to Assistant Solicitor

General Oscar Cox on August 15, 1942. No mention of the 1942 association

between Kennedy and Mrs. Fejos is found in the above memoranda.

A complete review of the above file fails to indicate any data

concerning John F. Kennedy with Mrs. Fejos in 1942 was ever

disseminated by the FBI either orally or by memorandum to anyone at anytime,

including the White House in 1971 or 1972 as implied by Mr. Colson.

Based on a review of the above file it is believed extensive

investigation of Mrs. Fejos nee Inga Arvad was certainly indicated by virtue

of the fact several allegations from a number of reliable and high-placed

sources were received by the Bureau concerning Mrs. Fejos to the effect

she was pro-Nazi, a German spy and was Hitler's publicity agent in Denmark

as well as her association with Nazi German leaders in the 1930's. _No active

investigation of John F. Kennedy, as implied by Mr. Colson, was conducted

by the FBI. Kennedy came to our attention only through our active investigation

of Mrs. Fejos.

WILLIAM R. ANDERSON

FORMER UNITED STATES

CONGRESSMAN

(DEMOCRAT - TENNESSEE)

An article in the January 19, 1975, issue of the Washington Post

written by Ronald Kessler stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation in-

vestigated former Congressman William R. Anderson of Tennessee after he

made remarks critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This article

States in part:

". . . an informed source said Hoover had ordered derogatory material

gathered on Rep. Anderson, who was defeated in 1972 after serving four

terms. The order was given after Anderson criticized Hoover for naming

Daniel and Philip Berrigan as having plotted to kidnap a high government

official. . . In complying with Hoover's order, agents in Nashville office

of the FBI first provided relatively inocuous information about Anderson,

said she thought Anderson had visited her place of business several years

earlier. The purported identification was made from a photo the agents

showed of Anderson, he added."

The source of the above information was not identified in the news article.

a & coA review of stigs matter hasbeen me arise folkiving nformation

has been developed:

The former Special Agent in Charge of our Memphis, Tennessee, Office

who was there in 1970 has advised that during the Fall of 1970 there was con-

siderable publicity concerning charges made by U. S. Representative Anderson

from Tennessee regarding the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Anderson's

charges generally reflected on the integrity, ability and accomplishments of the

Bureau and on the Director himself.

He recalled that shortly after the publicity an Agent of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation in Nashville, Tennessee, received a call from an old-

time "madam" who had furnished the Agent with information for many years

concerning prostitution. She volunteered to the Agent that she was irritated

by comments made by Anderson and said that she had supplied Anderson with

prostitutes for the past six or seven years at various motels in the Nashville

metropolitan area.

He said this information was volunteered and unsolicited and no in-

vestigation was conducted. The information was furnished in a personal letter

to Mr. Hoover by the then Special Agent in Charge of the Memphis Office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Former Agents in the Nashville, Tennessee, area during the pertinent

period were recently contacted. They have advised that they never investigated

Anderson and had never shown Anderson's photograph.

The Washington Post news article quoted earlier mentioned that the

identification of Anderson was made from a photograph shown by Agents. A

review of the files of the Memphis Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

disclosed only one picture of Anderson and it appeared in an article in the

Nashville Banner on January 21, 1975. There was no photograph of Anderson

in the files which might have been shown by Agents at an earlier date.

There was no evidence in the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

showing that former Director Hoover ". . . ordered derogatory material

gathered on Rep. Anderson. " There is no photograph of Anderson in the

files of our Memphis Office as noted above. There is no evidence that a

photograph of Anderson was shown by Agents and no evidence that an in-

vestigation of Anderson was conducted in relation to his association with

prostitutes.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA

(WALTER W. JENKINS)

Item 5 of the "Sullivan Memoranda" reads:

"Re: Walter W. Jenkins

"President Johnson called the FBI on October 27, 1964

to give instructions that Andy Choka (involved with

Jenkins) be pinned down more fully. President Johnson

said he had noted the FBI had not asked Choka if he had

known Grenier (phonetic) or Burch of the Republican

Party. President Johnson said FBI must ask

Choka this question. President Johnson also said that

the FBI should bring pressure to bear on the Park

Policeman who had lied about Jenkins attempting to

solicit him in LaFayette Park on the night of October 7,

1964. The FBI in keeping with Johnson's wishes had

already asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart Udall

Secretary of the Department of Interior to bring

pressure on the Park Policeman with no results.

President Johnson next discussed in some length on

the 'unfortunate publicity' about the flowers which

Mr. Hoover had sent to Mr. Jenkins. Instructions were

given to have FBI agents bear down on Choka with

respect to his knowledge of the two Republican National

Committee members mentioned as well as once again

questioting hinduas to a possible/frame up. 1124

A review of Bureau files has determined the existence of a

memorandum from C. D. DeLoach to Mr. Mohr dated October 27, 1964,

captioned "Walter W. Jenkins, Special Inquiry." The October 27, 1964,

memorandum reports the contents of a call from President Lyndon B.

Johnson to C. D. DeLoach on October 27, 1964.

Pertinent portions of the memorandum follow: y

"The President called me at approximately 2:10 p.m. today

while I was at lunch. He stated he had thoroughly read the big report

sent over to him on the Jenkins matter. He stated he thought it was very

complete and that the FBI had done a good job. He mentioned there was

one thing that was bothering him. He then stated that he felt we should

attempt to tie Andy Choka down a little further. He noted that we had

not asked Choka if he had known Grenier (ph.) or Burch of the Republican

Party. The President stated in order to round out this picture more

complete he thought we should contact Choka once again and ask him

these specific questions.

"The President asked me if I thought that Choka could have

been part of a frame-up. I told him there was no evidence to this effect,

that Choka had a previous record of sexual offenses and that apparently

he had been in the basement men's room of the YMCA on 10/7/64 with

the hopes of finding a person to commit a homosexual act with.

"The President did think we should attempt to bring

further pressure on the Park Policeman who had lied about Jenkins

attempting to solicit him in LaFayette Park on the night of 10/7/64.

"I told the President I had asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart

Udall, Secretary of the Department of Interior, to bring pressure on the

Park Policeman (Shoemaker) so that this man would reveal all facts in

his possession. The President stated Udall had already tried to bring

pressure on this man and that such pressure amounted to nothing."

The DeLoach memorandum continued that the President discussed

the Director's sending flowers to Jenkins at the time of Jenkins' hospitaliza-

tion. The memorandum stated that the President dwelt at some length on

the "unfortunate publicity" about the flowers.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN

(PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S INQUIRY CONCERNING

DONALD B. REYNOLDS' USE OF $25, 000

FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES)

The Sullivan memoranda on page 3 states that President

Lyndon B. Johnson telephonically requested the FBI to locate Don Reynolds

(a personality in the Bobby Baker case) and ascertain how Reynolds disposed

of $25, 000 which he allegedly received. President Johnson reportedly

was of the opinion that keynolds utilized the funds for bribery purposes

on behalf of the Republican Party. Sullivan states in his memoranda

that President Johnson's request was complied with but the results were

negative.

A review of Bureau files disclosed a memorandum dated

September 1, 1964, from Mr. Rosen to Mr. Belmont, reporting a telephone

request for investigation from the Deputy Attorney General Nicholas

Katzenbach to Inspector Robert Wick.

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach advised that the President

(Johnson) telephonically requested the Department of Justice conduct

investigation regarding an allegation by Senator John J. Williams. Senator

Williams stated on September 1, 1964, in the Senate, that a payoff was

alleged to have been made by Don Reynolds. Investigation was immediately

instituted upon Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach's request.

942: 0.0

Following the request of Katzenbach, President Johnson

telephonically contacted Assistant Director Cartha D. DeLoach on November 109.

1964, and referred to the same $25, 000 allegation with a personal request that

the matter be investigated. As the Bureau started the investigation upon

Katzenbach's earlier call on September 1, 1964, it was not necessary to open

a new case on the basis of the President's request. Additionally, the results

of our investigation were being disseminated to the Department of Justice and

the White House.

SON CLAIMING POSSESSION OF FILES ON WARREN

COMMISSION CRITICS

The Washington Star News, a Washington, D. C., daily news-

paper, carried an article in the January 31, 1975, edition, page A-4,

under an Associated Press release captioned "Boggs' Son Tells of Files

on Warren Panel, " The article quotes Tom H. Boggs, Jr., son of the

late Representative Hale Boggs, as claiming that in 1970 his father gave.

him dossiers which the FBI compiled on critics of the Warren Commission

in an attempt to discredit them. According to the article, Boggs' son

stated "they weren't basically sex files. They had some of that element

but most of the material dealt with left wing organizations these people

belonged to."

Tom H. Boggs, Jr., declined to identify all seven of the critical

authors but stated that writer Edward Jay Epstein and lawyer Mark Lane

were among the individuals on whom he had information. Boggs, Jr.;

reportedly stated that the information given him by his father included a

photograph of one of the seven engaging in an unnatural sex act with two

women.

In a review of Bureau files no evidence was found that any

information of this nature was ever disseminated directly to Hale Boggs

from the FBI.

so o rowaver, the surelu tie review indicates that on November 8

1966, memoranda were furnished to Marvin Watson, Special Assistant to

President Johnson, at the White House, at his request, setting forth pertinent

information contained in Bureau files regarding background on seven individuals

who wrote unfavorable articles concerning the Warren Commission findings.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN

(SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER)

Reference is made to my letter of January 30, 1975, setting

forth information in the "Sullivan memoranda." Your attention is invited

to specifically Item 8 of this letter. This item is made up of two paragraphs.

The first paragraph states that President Johnson asked the FBI to look

into members of Senator Goldwater's staff and give him the results. A review

was made and results furnished some of which contains derogatory information.

We have located a work copy of a memorandum to Mr. De Loach dated

October 26, 1964, captioned "NAME CHECK REQUEST FOR WHITE HOUSE."

This copy states that Bill Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, requested

a special check of the Bureau's files concerning persons employed in Senator

Goldwater's office. Using the United States Senate telephone directory, 15

individuals were listed and a memorandum was attached reflecting the results

of the check. The recommendation was that Mr. De Loach furnish the memo-

randum to Mr. Moyers.

We are unable to locate a record copy of the above-described

memoranda.

A record copy of a letter to Mr. Moyers dated October 27,

1964, is in file and was hand delivered by Mr. De Loach on October 28, 1964.

This letter advised that there was no derogatory information in our files on

13 of the individuals mentioned. However, concerning Edward Kenneth Nellor

who "has been his traveling press secretary, the FBI received information

on October 29, 1956-dhat Id Neller s• requently dated prostitutes. ahe

informant stated she had filled at least six dates . . . she also alleged that

on one occasion... he became drunk and abusive. She said she had avoided

him since that time." Also furnished was an Identification Record for William

Randall Seward who was apparently identical with Senator Goldwater's legisla-

tive assistant. This Identification Record showed a traffic violation on

August 10, 1956, in California.

Item & also states that President Johnson on October 20, 1964,

advised that Mr. (Walter) Jenkins had been cleared by Barry Goldwater's

squadron in 1958; that Goldwater would find it difficult to deny he knew

Jenkins well; that Jenkins had traveled with Goldwater; that Jenkins was

familiar with Goldwater activities.

We have been able to locate a memorandum dated October 20,

1964, to Mr. Hoover from Assistant Director Cartha D. De Loach. This

memorandum sets forth a conversation with President Johnson on October 19,

1964, on several matters including a great deal of discussion on the

"Walter Jenkins Affair." Portions of this memorandum contain the following

language, "The President stated Jenkins was cleared by Barry Goldwater's

squadron in 1958... the President stated that Goldwater would find it

difficult to deny that he knew Jenkins quite well personally• a that Tenkins

was familiar with the fact that Goldwater had had dates with a prostitute in

San Francisco and has spent all night with one of these women. "

February 13, 1975

COMMENTS MADE BY CHARLES W. COLSON

ON THE "TODAY" PROGRAM, FEBRUARY 7,

1975, CONCERNING INFORMATION FURNISHED

BY THE FBI ABOUT GEORGE S. MCGOVERN

Former White House Aide Charles W. Colson appeared on NBC's

"Today" program on February 7, 1975. During this appearance he stated

he was supplied with information from the FBI about "one unfortunate

incident" in the life of George McGovern. He stated that this information

was received in 1971 or 1972.

A review of the files of the FBI concerning George S. McGovern

reveals information concerning one incident that is contained therein which

may be referred to as "one unfortunate incident. " This information deals

with McGovern's fathering an illegitimate child in 1941. Information con-

cerning this incident was acquired and verified during a special inquiry

investigation which was initiated on December 8, 1960, at the request of

Lawrence F. O'Brien, assistant to then President-elect Kennedy.

This information, along with other information which was collected

during the course of this investigation, was disseminated to the White House

on December 27, 1960. The files of the FBI reflect that no further dis-

semination of this intormation was made. The FBI files reflect that on

March 6, 1961, the Secret Service requested a name check concerning

investigation had been conducted during December, 1960, results of which

were furnished to the White House and the Secret Service was referred to

The files of the FBI do not reflect any dissemination of information

concerning an illegitimate child of McGovern to anyone outside the FBI

during 1971 or 1972. Of course, the FBI has no information as to what sub-

sequent disposition was made by the White House of the information furnished

to it on December 27, 1960.

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

February 14, 1975

COMMENTS MADE BY CHARLES W. COLSON ON THE

"TODAY" PROGRAM, FEBRUARY 7, 1975, CONCERNING

INFORMATION FURNISHED WHITE HOUSE BY THE FBI

ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY DURING

WORLD WAR II

The following is submitted for your information:

An article starting on page Al of the February 7, 1975,

issue of the Washington Star-News stated Charles W. Colson, former

White House Aide, appeared on NBC's "Today" program on February 7,

1975. He stated while he was a White House Aide the FBI furnished

extensive information to the White House in 1971 or 1972 concerning

former President John F. Kennedy while he was with the United States

Navy during World War II. Colson stated it concerned information picked

up while the FBI was investigating a female Nazi agent. "Lieutenant

Kennedy was being followed by FBI Agents." Colson characterized the data as

"personal gossip."

A review of our files discloses the matter referred to by

Colson apparently concerns the investigation of Mrs. Paul Fejos, nee

¿ Inga Arvad, who was the subject of an Internal Security and Espionage -

5 German investigation conducted in the early 1940's. Mrs. Fejos first

came to our attention in November, 1940, upon receipt of a letter from

Fa fellow student from Columbia University School of Journalism, New York

• City, which stated Fejos may well have been sent to the United States by

Germany to influence morale. A New York City Office report dated June 7.

^1941, disclosed she had been friendly with Adolf Hitler and Herman Goering

Pin the 1930's. Mrs. Fejos appeared at our Washington Field Division on

December 12, 1941, along with representatives of the Washington Times Herald

to volunteer background regarding herself since it had been "rumored" she was

eworking for the German Propaganda Ministry. She was a friend of Kathleen

c Kennedy, daughter of former Ambassador Joseph Kennedy. She was then writing

sa column captioned "Did You Happen To See" for the Tirnes Herald which included

personality sketches on persons interviewed by her. She admitted having

NW 55154 DocId: 32989639 Page 47

## Page 48

interviewed Hitler twice as well as Goebbels and Goering while employed

by a Danish newspaper in the 1930's. She denied she was an intelligence

agent. Her husband was employed by the Swedish financier Axel Wenner-Gren

and had been in Western Pan America in charge of a scientific expedition

for him.

On November 14, 1941, a fellow Times Herald reporter

advised a Bureau official she thought Mrs. Fejos was a "spy." On January 17,

1942, a representative of ONI advised it had learned that Joseph Kennedy,

son of former Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, had been "playing around" with

Mrs. Fejos and would probably be transferred out of the Washington, D. C.,

area. A confidential informant of the FBI advised on January 21, 1942, that

"Ensign Jack"' of the United States Navy had apparently been spending the night

with Mrs. Fejos.

On January 26, 1942, the Attorney General authorized installation

of an electronic surveillance of Mrs. Fejos. In addition, "F.D.R." sent a

confidential memorandum from the White House dated May 4, 1942, to

Mr. Hoover suggesting Inga Arvad should be "specially watched" in view of

her connection with the Wenner-Gren expedition's leader (her husband) and

in view of certain other circumstances which had been brought to his attention.

Physical surveillance conducted by the FBI verified Mrs. Fejos

visited John Kennedy at Charleston, South Carolina, two weekends in February,

1942. During one of these weekends (February 6 - 9, 1942) they stayed in a

room rented in her name at the Fort Sumter Hotel in Charleston. Electronic sur-

veillance coverage disclosed that they engaged in sexual intercourse on a number

of occasions in the hotel room during this period. Kennedy disclosed to Mrs.

Fejos in general terms his tentative official assignment plans and the fact

Presidential Advisor Harry Hopkins had gone to the hospital and was not expected

to leave same. Our subsequent coverage of Mrs. Fejos disclosed additional

periodic contacts between John Kennedy and herself, the latest being in June,

1942. She obtained a Reno divorce from Paul Fejos an June 3, 1942, thereafter

using her maiden name Inga Arvad and moved to New York City August 7, 1942,

after having resigned her Times Herald job in July, 1942. Paul Fejos was

interviewed by Bureau Agents March 1 and 2, 1945, in New York City and Inga

Arvad was interviewed February 28, 1945, in Hollywood, California, concerning

the background, activities and associations with Axel Wenner-Gren who was

alleged to have been pro-German or pro-Nazi. The investigation of Mrs. Fejos

was closed in 1945 as no subversive activities had been uncovered.

The results of the 1945 interviews were furnished Assistant

Attorney General (War Division) Herbert Wechsler by memorandum dated

March 1, 1945, and captioned "Axel Wenner-Gren." Previously by memorandum

dated February 20, 1942, and captioned "Mrs. Paul Fejos nee Inga Arvad"

Mr. Edward J. Ennis, Director, Alien Enemy Control Unit, Department of

Justice, was furnished information then known concerning Mrs. Fejos in response

to his request for same dated February 4, 1942. His purpose in requesting

same was to ascertain if a Presidential Warrant of Apprehension should be

issued. Memorandum dated August 13, 1942, also containing background

and activity data concerning Mrs. Fejos was forwarded to Assistant Solicitor

General Oscar Cox on August 15, 1942. No mention of the 1942 association

between Kennedy and Mrs. Fejos is found in the above memoranda.

A complete review of the above file fails to indicate any data

concerning John F. Kennedy's affair with Mrs. Fejos in 1942 was ever

disseminated by the FBI either orally or by memorandum to anyone at anytime,

including the White House in 1971 or 1972 as implied by Mr. Colson.

Based on a review of the above file it is believed extensive

investigation of Mrs. Fejos nee Inga Arvad was certainly indicated by virtue

of the fact several allegations from a number of reliable and high-placed

sources were received by the Bureau concerning Mrs. Fejos to the effect

she was pro-Nazi, a German spy and was Hitler's publicity agent in Denmark

as well as her association with Nazi German leaders in the 1930's. No active

investigation of John F. Kennedy, as implied by Mr. Colson, was conducted

by the FBI.

Kennedy came to our attention only through our active investigation

of Mrs. Fejos.

SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY

AUGUST 22 - 28, 1964

Pursuant to your request concerning captioned matter, the

Washington Post on Sunday, January 26, 1975, carried a front page

story by staff writer Ronald Kessler reporting that during the 1964

Democratic National Convention, President Johnson received reports

on key convention delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by

the FBI on civil rights leaders, and attributed this information to a

Senate Watergate Committee memorandum. The article summarizes

a 1973 interview by the Committee with Leo T. Clark who on his

retirement on February 1, 1965, was the Senior Resident Agent at

Atlantic City. Kessler quotes Clark as saying the information was

reported to President Johnson based on an installation in the hotel

suite of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and a storetront used by civil

rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate Committee

that the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were

carried out by a special FBI team ordered by the White House and was

under the personal direction of Cartha D.. DeLoach, then an Assistant

Director.

According to Clark, the stated purpose of the operation was

to gather intelligence on potential violence or disruption and Clark is

reported as stating DeLoach told him to avoid discussing the operation

with the Secret Service.

The rews article continues Clark stated most of the informa-

tion obtained by the FBI was transmitted to President Johnson over a

telephone line specially installed to bypass the White House switchboard.

According to the news article, Clark said information furnished included

the activities of then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, identities of

Senators and Congressmen visiting King's hotel suite as well as persons

seeking support of civil rights leaders, plans of delegates or delegations

and speculation on Vice Presidential nominees.

Kessler's article states the authenticity of the Clark memo-

randum which cites room numbers of hotel suites bugged and the source

of funds for part of the operation were verified by persons who either

received it or were present when Clark was interviewed. The article

also states the FBI solicited intelligence through Agents posing as

reporters. According to the article, the memorandum indicates Clark

appeared in response to a subpoena but did not testify under oath.

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973

Senate Watergate interview of DeLoach and spells out DeLoach's denial

under oath having had a direct line to President Johnson or having

spoken with the President during the convention. Kessier also states

one surveillance was conducted as part of a continuing installation on

a person believed to be under the influence of the Communist Party

which had been approved by Kennedy.

A review of the personnel file of retired SA Clark contains

no information that he was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Com-

comittee at any time or has been in touch with the Bureau in this regard.

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE "SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate

Watergate Committee, John Dean, on June 27, 1973, testified and identi-

fied certain documents which he previously had furnished to the Committee.

Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony

as the "Sullivan memoranda, " apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,

former Assistant to the Director, who retired on October 41, 1911.

These typed documents consisted of five separate items and two enve -

lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building

marked "Personal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first document is headed

"President Johnson, Politics of the FBI." *This one-page document

concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on November 12,

1968, for the FBI to check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then

Vice Presidential candidate, Mr. Spiro Agnew, on the date of November 2,

1968, when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This document

The Deputy Attorney General

states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., November 13, 1968, to

ask about the progress the FBI was making in this matter. (This matter

pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matter.) A second item concerns

an alleged request by Marvin Watson on February 18, 1966, for the FBI

to cover Senate Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page

indicates President Johnson asked the FBI to determine if Republicans

were involved in instigating a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten page labeled

"Top Secret" and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation of

alleged FBI involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far

exceeded Roosevelt in using the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI,"

is marked "Top Secret," and consists of three pages. It cites ten alleged

incidents of misuse of the FBI by President Johnson as follows: (1) Re:

Mrs. Claire Chennault and Embassy of South Vietnam; (2) Re: Democratic

National Convention Atlantic City, 1964; (3) Re: Don Reynolds (a per-

sonality in the Bobby Baker case); (4) Re: Democratic Convention 1968;

(5) Re: Walter W. Jenkins; (6) Re: Walter Jenkins; (7) Re: Mrs. Claire

Chennault, Embassy of South Vietnam; (8) Re: Senator Barry Goldwater;

(9) Re: George Reedy; (10) Re: Walter Jenkins.

The fourth document reads as follows: "John, Please see the

enclosure the contents of which are self-explanatory. If I am to type

my observations myself please be tolerant of my poor typing. Bill."

The fifth document bears a marking "Secret" re "Watergate."

This is an offer on the part of Sullivan to testify before the Watergate

Committee in behalf of the Administration and by doing so could put the

current (Nixon) Administration in a very favorable light.

* In my letter dated Oslober & 1973 to then Deputy Attorliey

General, captioned "Cartha D. DeLoach, Subpoena by Select Committee

ön Presidential Activities" the Department was advised that Mr. DeLoach

had received a subpoena calling for his appearance before the Select

Committee on Presidential Activities on October 3, 1973. In this letter

we made several recommendations with regard to the contemplated

testimony by DeLoach. By letter to me dated December 7, 1973,

DeLoach advised that he furnished three hours of testimony to Senator

Howard Baker and minority counsel. He advised the testimony was under

oath and in executive session and the questioning was largely based on

the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. De Loach re ported

that Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the

advice and instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he

attempted to answer every question with blunt honesty and Department

Regulation 1622 was utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an

electronic surveillance as authorized by former Attorney General Kennedy.

REVIEW OF FBI FILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY

CONCERNING THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on August 20, 1964, a teletype was

directed to all continental offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)." This

teletype advises information has been received which indicates subversive

groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and the criminal

element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and the

Bureau must be advised of all such subversive, criminal, hoodlum, and

racial elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period.

All

offices were advised the Bureau was not interested in purely political

activity engaged in by delegates and others officially attending the convention. •

Other general instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A

follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 1964, that any information

of extreme importance or urgency should be submitted immediately by

teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-

munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setung

forth pertinent developments. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1964,

Mr. De Loach set forth a resume of his assignment with a special squad

of FBI personnel at the Democratic National Convention. DeLoach

reported the successful completion of this assignment.

He states that

•by ne ans of informant coverage, use of various confidential techniques,

infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were

able to keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments.

DeLoach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic

eity with secret service as well as state and local police.

- This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of

Martin Luther King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage

established of the headquarters of the Congress of Racial Equality -

Student Ñonviolent Coordinating Committee. De Loach states he was

able to advise the White House in advance of all plans made by these

two sources and coverage was highly effective. De Loach advises "with

Bureau approval" he instituted coverage on the Congress of Racial

Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee headquarters at

their meeting hall and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-

quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (two separate

factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a

highlight of the convention) and through cooperation of news media our

Agents were furnished press credentials. DeLoach reported that forty-

four pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter Jenkins at the

White House and to his memo randum he attached a copy of these daily

summaries dated August 24, 25, 26, and 27, 1964. These summaries are

in effect a running log of developments which took place at the convention.

DeLoach also states he arranged for a lease line (teiephone) between the

control post at Atlantic City and the Bureau. He concludes the memorandum

by making recommendations that personnel involved, namely twenty-seven Agents

one radio maintenance technician, and two stenographers of the Newark Office

õe commended. Mr. Hoover noted De Loach should receive a meritorious

award.

?

Concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party referred

to above, Bureau records show that on August 21, 1964, by letter to then

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach this Bureau responded to a request

dated August 19, 1964, from Mr. John Doar of the Civil Rights Division

of the Department requesting a check of Bureau files for any background

information available concerning persons affiliated with the Mississippi

Freedom Democratic Party delegation. In furnishing the results of the

name checks to Mr. Katzenbach, he was advised "this Bureau has not

conducted any investigation concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party nor has it taken any steps to identify party members." Bureau

files also reflect that at the request of Walter Jenkins of the White House

staff we furnished a memorandum dated July 22, 1964, to the White House

setting forth the results of the check of Bureau files concerning the

«Mississtir Freedom Democratic Party.

o i.

In a memorandum dated September 10, 1964, Mr. Hoover

reported Walter W. Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, called

and stated the President wanted Jenkins to call the Director to express

the thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the

finest the President had ever'seen. According to this memorandum,

The Deputy Attorney General

Jenkins told Mr. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and

because of the work some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly

where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were

not able to be very effective.

It should be noted that this particular

memorandum of Mr. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents

sent to John Dean.

A thorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-

randum or other documents pertaining to a request having been received

from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing that the

FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House

and had a direct line at his residene to the President so it well may be

that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it

orally with Mr. Hoover or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the

request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL

STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician

who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active

duty with the FBI have confirmed their participation on the squad under

DeLoach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there

was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not

feel that the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,

the instructions to the Agents were to develop advance intormation regard-

ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances

that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protection for

the President. Two of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover

assignment roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with

Secret Service, others were handling the large tumber of informants

that we moved into Atlantic City and other Agents were utilized in operating

the technical surveillance on King as well as the microphone installation

installed at the Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee headquarters in Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in charge

and he had with him in Atlantic City three Agents from his office and they

were aware that DeLoach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting

developments. Two Agents recalled DeLoach having a telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at

the time.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE

AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files

contain a memorandum to the Attorney General dated October 7, 1963,

captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., security Matter - Communist;

Communist Influence in Racial Matters, " wherein the Bureau recom-

mended that authority be granted to place a technical surveillance on

King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or at any future address

to which he may move. This memorandum was approved by Attorney

Cent, a med Coton to Party, A mera due date Ju nist

Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C, " pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the

facilities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta.

The memorandum observed that the Attorney General had already

authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since

this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by addi-

tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference.

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then

Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned

"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman at

Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in

Atlantic City. Bachman had previously received instructions from a

Division official that he explore the possibility of putting technical and

microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-

nical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available at

the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum

pointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone

"installation as well as the telephone installation. "This memorandum

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney General to cover

any residences which King may use with a technical installation.

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary

Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of

Bureau records fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization

for same. A search of microphone authorizations in the Newark Office

The Deputy Attorney General

likewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installation.

At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone

surveillance was maintained at the Seat of Government and authoriza-

tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Director

who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell dated

May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-

veillances. By memorandum dated September 27, 1965, Attorney

General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use of microphone surveil-

lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that

DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic City

mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committe was based on information that an apparent member of the

Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable activity, much

in a leadership capacity in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

Confidential informants reported that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee, among the various civil rights organizations, was a principal

target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time our

investigation of the Congress of Racial Equality was limited to deter-

mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organiza-

tion. (While a question arises as to the justification of using a microphone

surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted

that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of

Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification

for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of available

material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1964,

concerning the technical surveillance which verifies that the work on

ty phones in King's rooms at the hotel had been completed; however,

the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view

of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark files also attribute to

then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike

should be considered for the temporary Congress of Racial Equality

headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City. The only other

information contained in Newark files concerning these installations is

a handwritten log consisting of seventy-eight pages of overhears on

King's telephones.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well

as DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad

at the convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification of NBC.

At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves-

tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, instructions were set forth that all

Agent personnel are prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives

of any wire service for the purpose of establishing an investigative

cover. This rule was invoked after a news item appeared in the

Washington Post on June 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had

posed as a representative of the International News Service while covering

an antidrait demonstration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1968. The

allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement

as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

demonstration.

COVERAGE OF 1964 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL

CONVENTION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

Review of Bureau records fails to establish that any specialized

coverage was afforded to the Republican National Convention held in San

Francisco in July, 1964, and the only references in our records relate

to the pianning and execution by the Congress of Racial Equality of dem -

onstrations and picketing especially insofar as the nomination of Senator

Barry Goldwater was concerned. Several teletypes and communications

were submitted by San Francisco concerning the demonstrations and

follow-up letterhead memoranda were received by the Bureau and

disseminated.

one surveillance was conducted as part of a continuing installation on

a person believed to be under the influence of the Communist Party

which had been approved by Kennedy.

A review of the personnel file of retired SA Clark contains

no information that he was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Com-

comittee at any time or has been in touch with the Bureau in this regard.

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE "SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate

Watergate Committee, John Dean, on dune 26, lots, testilled and identi-

fied certain documents which he previously had furnished to the Committee.

Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony

as the "Sullivan memoranda, " apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,

former Assistant to the Director, Who retired on October a1, 1971.

These typed documents consisted of live separate items and two enve

lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building

marked "Personal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first doctment is headed

"PreSident Johrison, Politics of the FBIS This "one-page document&

concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on November 12,

1968, for the FBI to check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then

Vice Presidential candidate, Mr. Spiro Agnew, on the date of November 2,

1968, when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This document

states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., November 13, 1968, to

ask about the progress the FBI was making in this matter. (This matter

pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matter.) A second item concerns

an alleged request by Marvin Watson on February 18, 1966, for the FBI

to cover Senate Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page

indicates President Johnson asked the FBI to determine if Republicans

were involved in instigating a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten page labeled

"Top Secret" and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation of

alleged FBI involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far

exceeded Roosevelt in using the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI,"

is marked "Top Secret," and consists of three pages. It cites ten alleged

incidents of misuse of the FBI by President Johnson as follows: (1) Re:

Mrs. Claire Chennault and Embassy of South Vietnam; (2) Re: Democratic

National Convention Atlantic City, 1964; (3) Re: Don Reynolds (a per-

sonality in the Bobby Baker case); (4) Re: Democratic Convention 1968;

(5) Re: Walter W. Jenkins; (6) Re: Walter Jenkins; (7) Re: Mrs. Claire

Chennault, Embassy of South Vietnam; (8) Re: Senator Barry Goldwater;

(9) Re: George Reedy; (10) Re: Walter Jenkins.

The fourth document reads as follows: "John, Please see the

enclosure the contents of which are self-explanatory. If I am to type

my observations myself please be tolerant of my poor typing. Bill."

The fifth document bears a marking "Secret" re "Watergate."

This is an offer on the part of Sullivan to testify before the Watergate

Committee in behalf of the Administration and by doing so could put the

current (Nixon) Administration in a very favorable light.

s0th my letter dated October 2, 1973, to then Deputy Attorley *

Committee on Presidential Activities on October 3, 1973. In this letter

we made several recommendations with regard to the contemplated

testimony by DeLoach. By letter to me dated December 7, 1973,

DeLoach advised that he furnished three hours of testimony to Senator

Howard Baker and minority counsel. He advised the testimony was under

the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. De Loach re ported

that Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the

advice and instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he

attempted to answer every question with blunt honesty and Department

Regulation 1622 was utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an

electronic surveillance as authorized by former Attorney General Kennedy.

REVIEW OF FBI FILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY

CONCERNING THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on August 20, 1964, a teletype was

directed to all continental offices captioned,

"Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security). " This

teletype advises information has been received which indicates subversive

groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and the criminal

element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and the

Bureau must be advised of all such subversive, criminal, hoodlum, and

racial elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period. All

offices were advised the Bureau was not interested in purely political

activity engaged in by delegates and others officially attending the convention. •

Other general instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A

follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 1964, that any information

of extreme importance or urgency should be submitted immediately by

teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-

munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting

forth pertinent developments. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1964,

Mr. DeLoach set forth a resume of his assignment with a special squad

of FBI personnel at the Democratic National Convention. DeLoach

reported the successful completion of this assignment. He states that

•by ne ans of intormant coverage, use of various contidential techniques,

infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and thraugh

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were

able to keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments.

De Loach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic

City with Secret Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of

Martin Luther King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage

established on the headquarters of the Congress of Racial Equality -

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. DeLoach states he was

able to advise the White House in advance of all plans made by these

two sources and coverage was highly effective. De Loach advises "with

Bureau approval" he instituted coverage on the Congress of Racial

Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee headquarters at

their meeting hall and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-

quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (two separate

factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a

highlight of the convention) and through cooperation of news media our

Agents were furnished press credentials. DeLoach reported that forty -

four pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter Jenkins at the

White House and to his memo randum he attached a copy of these daily

summaries dated August 24, 25, 26, and 27, 1964. These summaries are

in effect a running log of developments which took place at the convention.

De Loach also states he arranged for a lease line (telephone) between the

control post at Atlantic City and the Bureau. He concludes the memorandum

by making recommendations that personnel involved, namely twenty-seven Agent:

one radio maintenance technician, and two stenographers of the Newark Office

be commended. Mr. Hoover noted De Loach should receive a meritorious

award.

?

Concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party referred

to above, Bureau records show that on August 21, 1964, by letter to then

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach this Bureau responded to a request

dated August 19, 1964, from Mr. John Doar of the Civil Rights Division

of the Department requesting a check of Bureau files for any background

information available concerning persons affiliated with the Mississippi

• Freedom Democratic Party delegation. In furnishing the results of the

name checks to Mr. Katzenbach, he was advised "this Bureau has not

conducted any investigation concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party nor has it taken any steps to identify party members." Bureau

files also reflect that at the request of Walter Jenkins of the White House

staff we furnished a memorandum dated July 22, 1964, to the White House

setting forth the results of the check of Bureau files concerning the

Mississipfi Freedom Dernocratic Party.

In a memorandum dated September 10, 1964, Mr. Hoover

reported Walter W. Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, called

and stated the President wanted Jenkins to call the Director to express

the thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the

finest the President had ever seen. According to this memorandum,

The Deputy Attorney General

Jenkins told Mr. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and

because of the work some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly

where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were

not able to be very effective.

It should be noted that this particular

memorandum of Mr. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents

sent to John Dean.

• A thorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-

randum or other documents pertaining to a request having been received

from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing that the

FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House

and had a direct line at his residence to the President so it well may be

that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it

orally with Mr. Hoover or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the

request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL

STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician

who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active

duty with the FBI have confirmed their participation on the squad under

DeLoach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there

was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not

feel that the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,

the instructions to the Agents were to develop advance intormation regard-

ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances

that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protection for

the President. Two of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover

assignment roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with

Secret Service, owers were handring ine largestumber of informants

that we moved into Atlantic City and other Agents were utilized in operating

the technical surveillance on King as well as the microphone installation

installed at the Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee headquarters in Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in charge

and he had with him in Atlantic City three Agents from his office and they

were aware that DeLoach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting

developments. Two Agents recalled DeLoach having a telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at

the time.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE

AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files

contain a memorandum to the Attorney General dated October 7, 1963,

captioned 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Security Matter - Communist;

Communist Influence in Racial Matters, " wherein the Bureau recom-

mended that authority be granted to place a technical surveillance on

King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or at any future address

to which he may move. This memorandum was approved by Attorney

General Kennedy, October 10, 1963. A memorandum dated July 7,

1964, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist

Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the

facilities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta.

The memorandum observed that the Attorney General had already

authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since

this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by addi-

tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference.

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then

Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned

"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman at

Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in

Atlantic City. Bachman had previously received instructions from a

Division official that he explore the possibility of putting technical and

microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-

nical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available at

the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum

ween Ointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone

Mastalation asswell as the telephone instatation. This methoranoim 6&

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney General to cover

any residences which King may use with a technical installation.

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary

Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of

Bureau records fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization

for same. A search of microphone authorizations in the Newark Office

"The Deputy Attorney General

likewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installation.

At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone

surveillance was maintained at the Seat of Government and authoriza-

tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Director

who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell dated

May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-

veillances. By memorandum dated September 27, 1965, Attorney

General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use of microphone surveil-

lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that

DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic City

mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committe was based on information that an apparent member of the

Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable activity, much

in a leadership capacity in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

Confidential informants reported that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee, among the various civil rights organizations, was a principal

target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time our

investigation of the Congress of Racial Equality was limited to deter-

mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organiza-

tion. (While a question arises as to the justification of using a microphone

surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted

that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of

Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification

for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of available

material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1964,

concerning the technical surveillance which verifies that the work on

two phones in King's rooms at the hotekhad been completed however;

the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view

of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark files also attribute to

then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike

should be considered for the temporary Congress of Racial Equality

headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City. The only other

intormation contained in Newark files concerning these installations is

a handwritten log consisting of seventy-eight pages of overhears on

King's telephones.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well

as DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad

at the convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification of NBC.

At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves-

tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, instructions were set forth that all

Agent personnel are prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives

of any wire service for the purpose of establishing an investigative

cover. This rule was invoked after a news item appeared in the

Washington Post on June 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had

posed as a representative of the International News Service while covering

an antidraft demonstration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1968. The

allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement

as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

demonstration.

COVERAGE OF 1964 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL

CONVENTION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

Review of Bureau records fails to establish that any specialized

coverage was afforded to the Republican National Convention held in San

Francisco in July, 1964, and the only reierences in our records relate

to the planning and execution by the Congress of Racial Equality of dem -

onstrations and picketing especially insofar as the nomination of Senator

Barry Goldwater was concerned. Several teletypes and communications

were submitted by San Francisco concerning the demonstrations and

follow-up letterhead memoranda were received by the Bureau and

Re: Information Concerning Contacts Between

Representatives of the Soviet Union and

Congress Furnished to the White House at the

Request of the President

The President continued by stating he would like

Director Hoover to have prepared a chronological study,

beginning in July, 1964, and continuing up to the present

time, of all legislators who have called at the Soviet Embassy.

He stated he felt such a study would clearly reflect that

Senators J. William Falbright of Arkansas and Wayne L. Morse

of Oregon had been in constant contact with the Soviet Embassy.

Mr. Hoover subsequently instructed that the requested

material be prepared for transmittal to the White House and

this was accomplished by means of a letter to Mr. W. Marvin

Watson, Special Assistant to the. President, dated March 21,

1966, which transmitted the requested summary of information

which was dated March 18, 1966. The summary

set forth in

chronological order contacts by each Senator,

Representative,

or statt member who had contacts with the Soviet Embassy during

the period July 1, 1964, through March 17, 1966. The transmittal

letter closed with

a recapitulation of the number of contacts in

each category together with the statement, "Based upon our

coverage, it appears that Soviet officials are making more

contacts with Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas,

Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, Senator George McGovern

of South Dakota, and Senator Wayne L. Morse of Oregon than with

other United States legislators."

The summary, which comprised 67 pages, stated:

"Information not attributed herein to specific sources

in the past.

The information was developed through coverage

of representatives and establishments of the Soviet Union

the United States.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has

conducted no investigation of members of Congress."

On March 22, 1966, Mr. Hoover, noting that the

President was very pleased with the material, instructed that

similar material be prepared, bringing this matter up to date

every ten days to two weeks.

Re: Information Concerning Contacts Between

Representatives of the Soviet Union and

Members or Staff Personnel of the United States

Congress Furnished to the White House at the

Request of the President

In early May, 1966, the President requested that

similar information, going back to January 1, 1965, be furnished

to him, but asked that it be presented in chronological fashion

in order to give a day-to-day picture of contacts between

Congressional representatives and Soviet officials. The

President felt that such a summary would give a concise picture

of a pattern of constant and continual contacts between the

Soviets and Congressional representatives:

This summary, which

was dated May 5, 1966, and which consisted of 48 pages, was

delivered to the President on May 13, 1966. This summary noted

that information contained therein was obtained from coverage

of representatives and establishments of the soviet Union in

the United States and that "The FBI has conducted no investi-

gation of members of Congress."

Biweekly additions to this summary were subsequently

furnished to the White House.

Dissemination of this material

to the White House was terminated in January, 1969, on the

instructions of Director Hoover.

It should also be noted that on July 27, 1970,

Larry Higby, Assistant to Mr. H. R. Haldeman, Special Assistant

to the President, advised that Mr.

Haldeman wanted any

information possessed by the FBI relating to contacts

between

Soviet nationals

and Members of Congress and its staff.

Material concerning such matters which had been previously

furnished to the White House at the request of President Johnson

was reviewed and a statistical

compilation of such contacts,

from January 1, 1967, was furnished to Mr. Haldeman as an

enclosure to a letter dated July 29, 1970, classified "Top

"secrot." The statistics were broken?downtas to:enators,

Representatives and Stati employees. This report noted the

information therein was developed through FBI coverage of

soviet officials and establishments in Washington, D. C.,

and included two examples of Soviet intelligence initiatives

directed against Capitol Hill without identifying the Soviets

or Americans involved.

Re:

Information Concerning Contacts Between

Congress Furnished to the White House at the

Request of the President

The President continued by stating he would like

Director Hoover to have prepared a chronological study,

beginning in July, 1964, and continuing up to the present

time, of all legislators who have called at the Soviet Embassy.

He stated he felt such a study would clearly reflect that

Senators J. William Falbright of Arkansas and Wayne I. Morse

of Oregon had been in constant contact with the Soviet Embassy.

Mr: Hoover subsequently instructed that the requested

material be prepared for transmittal to the White House and

this was accomplished by means of a letter to Mr. W. Marvin

Watson, Special Assistant to the President, dated March 21,

1966, which transmitted the requested summary of information

which was dated March 18, 1966.

The summary

set forth in

chronological order contacts by each senator, Representative,

or Statt member who had contacts with the soviet Embassy during

the period July 1, 1964, through March 17, 1966. The transmittal

letter closed with a recapitulation of the number of contacts in

each category together with the statement, "Based upon our

coverage, it appears that Soviet officials are making more

contacts with Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas,

Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, Senator George McGovern

of South Dakota, and Senator Wayne I. Morse of Oregon than with

other United States legislators."

The summary, which comprised 67 pages, stated:

"Information not attributed herein to specific sources

was obtained from confidential sources who have furnished

in the past. The information was developed through coverage

of representatives and establishments of the Soviet Union in

conducted no investigation of members of Congress."

On March 22, 1966, MI. Hoover, noting that the

President was very pleased with the material, instructed that

similar material be prepared, bringing this matter up to date

every ten days to two weeks.

Re:

Information Concerning Contacts Between

Representatives of the Soviet Union and

Members or Staff Personnel of the United States

Congress Furnished to the White House at the

Request of the President

In early May, 1966, the President requested that

similar information, going back to January 1, 1965, be furnished

to him, but asked that it be presented in chronological fashion

in order to give a day-to-day picture of contacts between

Congressional representatives and Soviet officials.

The

President felt that such a summary would give a concise picture

of a pattern of constant and continual contacts between the

Soviets and Congressional representatives:

This summary, which

was dated May 5, 1966, and which consisted of 48 pages, was

delivered to the President on May 13, 1966.

This summary noted

that information contained therein was obtained from coverage

of representatives and establishments of the Soviet Union in

the United States and that "The FBI has conducted no investi-

gation of members of Congress."

Biweekly additions to this summary were subsequently

furnished

to the White House.

Dissemination of this material

to the white House was terminated in January, 1969, on the

instructions of Director Hoover.

It should also be noted that on July 27, 1970,

Larry Higby, Assistant to Mr. H. R. Haldeman, Special Assistant

to the President, advised that Mr. Haldeman wanted any

information possessed by the FBI relating to contacts between

Soviet nationals and Members of Congress and its staff.

Material concerning such matters which had been previously

furnished to the White House at the request of President Johnson

was reviewed

and a statistical compilation of such contacts,

from January 1, 1967, was furnished to Mr. Haldeman as an

enclosure to a letter dated July 29, 1970, classified "Top

WILLIAM R. ANDERSON

FORMER UNITED STATES

CONGRESSMAN

(DEMOCRAT - TENNESSEE)

An article in the January 19, 1975, issue of the Washington Post

written by Ronald Kessler stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation in-

vestigated former Congressman William R. Anderson of Tennessee after he

made remarks critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This article

states in part:

". . . an informed source said Hoover had ordered derogatory material

gathered on Rep. Anderson, who was defeated in 1972 after serving four

terms. The order was given after Anderson criticized Hoover for naming

Daniel and Philip Berrigan as having plotted to kidnap a high government

official. . . In complying with Hoover's order, agents in Nashville office

of the FBI first provided relatively inocuous information about Anderson,

the source said. But Hoover ordered them to try again, the source said,

and this time they reported that the madam of a house of prostitution had

said she thought Anderson had visited her place of business several years

earlier. The purported identification was made from a photo the agents

showed of Anderson, he added. "

The source of the above information was not identified in the news article.

A retaw of if mation hastech made and the following irformakin

has been developed:

The former Special Agent in Charge of our Memphis, Tennessee, Office

who was there in 1970 has advised that during the Fall of 1970 there was con-

siderable publicity concerning charges made by U. S. Representative Anderson

from Tennessee regarding the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Anderson's

charges generally reflected on the integrity, ability and accomplishments of the

to a ric

Bureau and on the Director himself.

He recalled that shortly after the publicity an Agent of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation in Nashville, Tennessee, received a call from an old-

time "madam" who had furnished the Agent with information for many years

concerning prostitution. She volunteered to the Agent that she was irritated

by comments made by Anderson and said that she had supplied Anderson with

prostitutes for the past six or seven years at various motels in the Nashville

metropolitan area.

• He said this information was volunteered and unsolicited and no in-

vestigation was conducted. The information was furnished in a personal letter

to Mr. Hoover by the then Special Agent in Charge of the Memphis Office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Former Agents in the Nashville, Tennessee, area during the pertinent

period were recently contacted. They have advised that they never investigated

Anderson and had never shown Anderson's photograph.

The Washington Post news article quoted earlier mentioned that the

identification of Anderson was made from a photograph shown by Agents. A

review of the files of the Memphis Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

disclosed only one picture of Anderson and it appeared in an article in the

Nashville Banner on January 21, 1975. There was no photograph of Anderson

in the files which might have been shown by Agents at an earlier date.

There was no evidence in the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

showing that former Director Hoover ". • • ordered derogatory material

gathered on Rep. Anderson." There is no photograph of Anderson in the

files of our Memphis Office as noted above. There is no evidence that a

photograph of Anderson was shown by Agents and no evidence that an in-

vestigation of Anderson was conducted in relation to his association with

prostitutes.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA

(WALTER W. JENKINS)

Item 5 of the "Sullivan Memoranda" reads:

"Re: Walter W. Jenkins

"President Johnson called the FBI on October 27, 1964

to give instructions that Andy Choka (involved with

Jenkins) be pinned down more fully. President Johnson

said he had noted the FBI had not asked Choka if he had

known Grenier (phonetic) or Burch of the Republican

Party. President Johnson said FBI must ask

Choka this question. President Johnson also said that

the FBl should bring pressure to bear on the Park

Policeman who had lied about Jenkins attempting to

solicit him in LaFayette Park on the night of October 7,

1964. The FBI in keeping with Johnson's wishes had

already asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart Udall

Secretary of the Department of Interior to bring

pressure on the Park Policeman with no results.

President Johnson next discussed in some length on

the 'unfortunate publicity' about the flowers which

Mr. Hoover had sent to Mr. Jenkins. Instructions were

given to have FBI agents 'bear down on Choka with

respect to his knowledge of the two Republican National

Committee members mentioned as well as once again

questioning him as to atpossible frame up."

A review of Bureau files has determined the existence of a

memorandum from C. D. De Loach to Mr. Mohr dated October 27, 1964,

captioned "Walter W. Jenkins, Special Inquiry." The October 27, 1964,

memorandum reports the contents of a call from President Lyndon B.

Johnson to C. D. DeLoach on October 27, 1964.

Pertinent portions of the memorandum follow: › .

"The President called me at approximately 2:10 p.m. today

while I was at lunch. He stated he had thoroughly read the big report

sent over to him on the Jenkins matter. He stated he thought it was very

complete and that the FBI had done a good job. He mentioned there was

one thing that was bothering him. He then stated that he felt we should

aitempt to tie Andy Choka down a little further. He noted that we had

not asked Choka if he had known Grenier (ph.) or Burch of the Republican

Party. The President stated in order to round out this picture more

complete he thought we should contact Choka once again and ask him

these specific questions.

"The President asked me if I thought that Choka could have

been part of a frame-up. I told him there was no evidence to this effect,

that Choka had a previous record of sexual offenses and that apparently

he had been in the basement men's room of the YMCA on 10/7/64 with

the hopes of finding a person to commit a homosexual act with.

"The President did think we should attempt to bring

further pressure on the Park Policeman who had lied about Jenkins

attempting to solicit him in La Fayette Park on the night of 10/7/64.

"I told the President I had asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart

Udall, Secretary of the Department of Interior, to bring pressure on the

Park Policeman (Shoemaker) so that this man would reveal all facts in

his possession. The President stated Udall had already tried to bring

pressure on this man and that such pressure amounted to nothing."

The DeLoach memorandum continued that the President discussed

the Director's sending flowers to Jenkins at the time of Jenkins' hospitaliza-

tion. The memorandum stated that the President dwelt at some length on

the "unfortunate publicity" about the flowers.

INFORMATION CONCERNING WASHINGTON STAR NEWS

ARTICLE, JANUARY 31, 1975, REGARDING HALE BOGGS'

SON CLAIMING POSSESSION OF FILES ON WARREN

COMMISSION CRITICS

The Washington Star News, a Washington, D. C., daily news-

paper, carried an article in the January 31, 1975, edition, page A-4,

under

an Associated Press release captioned "Boggs' Son Tells of Files

on Warren Panel. " The article quotes Tom H. Boggs, Jr., son of the

late Representative Hale Boggs, as claiming that in 1970 his father gave

him dossiers which the FBI compiled on critics of the Warren Commission

in an attempt to discredit them. According to the article, Boggs' son

stated "they weren't basically sex files. They had some of that element

but most of the material dealt with left wing organizations these people

belonged to. "

Tom H. Boggs, Jr., declined to identify all seven of the critical

authors but stated that writer Edward Jay Epstein and lawyer Mark Lane

were among the individuals on whom he had information. Boggs, Jr.:

reportedly stated that the information given him by his father included a

photograph of one of the seven engaging in an unnatural sex act with two

women.

enga

In a review of Bureau files no evidence was found that any

information of this nature was ever disseminated directly to Hale Boggs

from the FBI.

However, the bureat file review indicates that on November 8e

1966, memoranda were furnished to Marvin Watson, Special Assistant to

President Johnson, at the White House, at his request, setting forth pertinent

information contained in Bureau files regarding background on seven individuals

who wrote unfavorable articles concerning the Warren Commission findings.

The seven individuals mentioned in the memorandum to

Mr. Watson were Edward Jay Epstein; Joachim Joesten; Penn Jones, Jr.;

Mark Lane; Richard H. Popkin; Leo Sauvage; Harold Weisberg.

In a cover letter to Mr. Watson he was advised that Bureau

files contained no pertinent data with respect to Sylvan Fox, an author

critical of the investigation surrounding President Kennedy's assassina-

tion.

In addition to background information regarding the seven critics

of the Warren Commission, we disseminated to Mr. Watson at the White

House one facial photograph of Mark Lane, one obscene photograph of Mark

Lane lying on a bed, a hand printed instruction by Lane regarding perverted

sexual acts and signed statements from two women concerning the per-

formance of unnatural sex acts on the person of Mark Lane.

Regarding the dissemination concerning Mark Lane, we

received information that in 1962 the District Attorney of Queens County,

New York, conducted an investigation of Mark Lane for alleged sodomy.

At that time statements from two women were received along with an

obscene photograph of Lane and hand printed instruction which Lane gave

to one of the girls in order that they could perform upon his person

perverted sexual acts of a sadistic masochistic nature.

The background information furnished to the White House

regarding Mark Lane indicated that he is an attorney, born in New York

City on February 24, 192%, and that he has a long history of affiliation

with Communist Party front groups and organizations which have been

cited as subversive.

The 'Daily Worker" for May 27, 1953, states that the National

Lawyers Guild held an election of officers on May 26, 1953, and that Mark

Lane was elected an ex officio member of the board of directors of the

Nitional Lawyers Guild. The (Daily Workel was an East Coast com-

munist newspaper. The House Committee on Un-American Activities has

described the National Lawyers Guild as the foremost legal bulwark of

the Communist Party.

Lane was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1960änd

in May, 1962, he was defeated in an attempt to secure the nomination as

a candidate for United States House of Representatives from the 19th

Congressional District in New York. A source reported inyconnection

with Lane's attempt to secure this nomination that a meeting of the

Manhattan County Communist Party Coordinating Committee was held

on April 5, 1962, to discuss election problems in the 19th Congressional

District.

It was reported that the speaker at this meeting stated that the

Committee had to support Mark Lane as the candidate since his views

were most consistent with the "people's program." The speaker

further indicated that a victory for Lane would be a tremendous victory

for the progressive movement.

In the Washington Star News article the name of Edward Jay

Epstein was also mentioned by lom H. Boggs, Jr. According to Bureau

mies, Epstein was born December 6, 1935, and wrote "Inquest" as his

Master's thesis at Cornell University. In 1958 he traveled as a tourist

in the Soviet Union and described himself as a student residing in New

York City. As of November 8, 1966, the date of FBI dissemination

to the White House regarding critics of the Warren Commission, Epstein

had no known arrest record.

No information was developed or furnished to the White House

concerning immoral conduct on the part of the seven above-listed critics

of the Warren Commission with the exception of the information furnished

regarding Mark Lane.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN

(PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S INQUIRY CONCERNING

DONALD B. REYNOLDS' USE OF $25, 000

FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES)

The Sullivan memoranda on page 3 states that President

Lyndon B. Johnson telephonically requested the FBI to locate Don Reynolds

(a personality in the Bobby Baker case) and ascertain how Reynolds disposed

of $25, 000 which he allegedly received. President Johnson reportedly

was of the opinion that Reynolds utilized the funds for bribery purposes

on behalf of the Republican Party. Sullivan states in his memoranda

that President Johnson's request was complied with but the results were

negative.

A review of Bureau files disclosed a memorandum dated

September 1, 1964, from Mr. Rosen to Mr. Belmont, reporting a telephone

request for investigation from the Deputy Attorney General Nicholas

Katzenbach to Inspector Robert Wick.

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach advised that the President

(Johnson) telephonically requested the Department of Justice conduct

investigation regarding an allegation by Senator John J. Williams. Senator

Williams stated on September 1, 1964, in the Senate, that a payoff was

alleged to have been made by Don Reynolds. Investigation was immediately

instituted upon Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach's request.

eate following ing request of Katzenbach, Presidents ohnsong

telephonically contacted Assistant Director Cartha D. DeLoach on November 103.

1964, and referred to the same $25, 000 allegation with a personal request that

the matter be investigated. As the Bureau started the investigation upon

Katzenbach's earlier call on September I, 1964, it was not necessary to open

a new case on the basis of the President's request. Additionally, the results

of our investigation were being disseminated to the Department of Justice and

the White House.

FBi turned down requests for a body recorder and also for the

contents of a communication from Mr. Hoover. to President Johnson

regarding this matter, the following is submitted.

By memorandum dated 3/25/65, Assistant Attorney General,

(AAG) Criminal Division, requested that the FBI take necessary

steps to place a body recorder on the person of Wayne I. Bromley

to record the conversations of Bromley with Clifford I. Jones and

Bobby Baker.

This would have necessitated placing a recorder on

the person of Bromley prior to the time he left Washington, D. C.,

as he was being met in Los Angeles by Jones upon his arrival.'

Bromley, a Washington, D. C., Attorney and close associate of

Baker, was cooperating with the FBI and had testified before

the Baker Grand Jury. Jones is a former Lieutenant Governor

of the State of Nevada and is an Attorney as well as a member

of one of the corporations which was furnishing cash to Baker

for his assistance.

By letter dated 3/26/65 from the Director to Mr. Herbert

I. Miller, AAG, he was informed the Department's request for

the use of the body recorder on the person of Bromley was

inadvisable in view of the fact that the maximum security for

the equipment and Bromley's person could not be accomplished, as

well as adequate security could not be accomplished at the hotels.

By letter®

Special Assistant to the President, The White House, the President

was advised of the circumstances regarding the request of the

Criminal Division of the Department to place a body recorder on

Bromley and the Bureau's declination to honor this request.

refused to electronically monitor a meeting in Los Angeles

on 3/26/65 between Baker and two of his associates. These

calls and the meeting were referred to in a 1/1l/67 news

article in the "Washington Evening Star" and undoubtedly

will receive much publicity when results are introduced as

evidence in present trial of Baker."

On 1/17/67 Assistant to the Director Cartha D. DeLoach

was called to the White House by Marvin Watson and Watson

referred to the Director's memorandum to the President setting

forth the information that the FBI had refused a request to

utilize a recording device in the Baker case.

Watson furnished

information that inasmuch as the Bureau of Narcotics had later

handled this matter for the Department of Justice, the President

refused to electronically monitor a meeting in Los

Angeles

on 3/26/65 between Baker and two of his associates. These

calls and the meeting were referred to in a 1/11/67 news

article in the "Washington Evening Star" and undoubtedly

will receive much publicity when results are introduced as

evidence in present trial of Baker."

On 1/17/67 Assistant to the Director Cartha D. DeLoach

was called to the white House by Marvin Watson and Watson

referred to the Director's memorandum to the President setting

forth the information that the FBI had refused a request to

utilize a recording device in the Baker case.

Watson furnished

information that inasmuch as the Bureau of Narcotics had later

handled this matter for the Department of Justice, the President

had demanded a summary memorandum from the Secretary of Treasury

concerning the matter.

Watson also indicated the President was

quite exercised about the fact the FBI had properly refused

only

to have the Treasury honor the request of the Department of Justice.

-G s

• Watso stated that the President wanted a complete

run-down on the tollowing names, and that any inquiry should be

made as discreetly as possible.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION CONCERNING

IN BOBBY BAKER INVESTIGATION IN 1965

He also requested that it should be specifically pointed out

whether any of the aforementioned individuals were close to

Bobby Kennedy. Mr. Watson

further stated the President did

not want any record made of this request and wanted the informa-

tion furnished to him in blind memorandum form. Information was

prepared in blind memorandum form regarding these individuals

and furnished to the President and, with the exception of

fOrmeI AAG Miller, our file review and liaison representatives

did not develop any information indicating any association of

the individuals with Robert F. Kennedy.

Never in our history have we been confronted with as critical a need for

informant coverage. Terrorist violence is all around us and more has been

threatened. Even our own doors are being threatened by Weatherman fanatics.

part of the picture. These violence oriented black and white savages are at war

positions. By the time they are 2L years of age they are almost ready to leave

¡college and have been subjected to the corrosive influence and brainwashing of ultra-

liberal and radical professors.

OBSERVATIONS:

The important consideration, of course, is to protect the Bureau from

possible embarrassment. Many of our 18, 19 and 20-year-old men and women are

highly intelligent, mature, and loyal citizens. This has recently been recognized

by the Congress in lowering the voting age to l8 years. It is felt the same concept

can logically be applied to the revolutionary conflict at home and particularly on

campuses. diant. dare this were. A

Development of all security and racial informants, regardless of age, is

very closely supervised at the Seat of Government. It is felt that selective use of

the 18 through 20-year-old age bracket on specific SAC recommendation and with

close scrutiny at the Seat of Government can be of tremendous benefit. These

fimatters will continue to be very carefully looked into during all field inspections.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the appropriate Manual citations be changed to read "Students

under age 18. . . ." I approved, to be implemented by Domestic Intelligence

Division.

ADDENDUM (9/3/70), HCS :CSH - INQ

I strongly urge the approval of this recommendation. As the

memorandum states, these are indeed critical times.

No one can predict

with accuracy the outcome of the revolutionary struggle going on

in

this country at this time.

Those under 20 years of age are playing a

predominant role in campus violence.

Two of the subjects in the

University of Wisconsin case are under 20.

RE:

SECURITY AND RACIAL INFORMANTS

Dear Sir:

Never in our history have we been confronted with

as critical a need for informant coverage. Terroristic

violence surrounds us and more has been threatened. Bombings,

assassination of police officers, kidnapping and murder are

all part of the picture. Fanatics are at large who are at

war with the Government and the American people. Particularly

critical is the need for reliable information about the

activities of violence-oriented youthful groups on campus.

As you are aware, you have been previously instructed

not to use campus student informants under the age of 21. In

TieN 01

current circumstances, you are authorized to develop

student security and racial informants who are 18 years of age

or older.

This presents you with a tremendous opportunity to

expand your coverage, which is expected. However, in no way

are your obligations

to exercise selectivity and tight control

lessened in this most sensitive area.

Appropriate manual and handbook changes are forthcoming.

RE: USE OF CONCEALED RECORDING DEVICES

Recordings obtained by Bureau Agents and sources are

to be handled as evidence and should be reviewed in the field

office responsible for obtaining same. Inflamnatory remarks

are to be set forth verbatim and other pertinent dnta sumnarized

in a letterhead memorandum. A copy of the tape should then be

forwarded to the Bureau.

• If it is not possible to cover public appearances

through use of a concealed recording device, or otherwise

recorded for evidentiary use, the Bureau is to be advised in

the cover conmnication transmitting the letterhead memorandm

why such action was not possible.

In those instances where copies of taped recordings

• %

of speeches by Black and Hew Left extremists are furnished by

police departments, for ezample, It will be necessary to similarly

review the material, report the.

infornation as outlined above,

and forvard a copy to the Bureau. Additionally, under these

circunstances, you should advise in the cover coumunication of

the location of the original tape and the identity of the

individual who can introduce it in a court of law.

It is expected that all Agent personnel engaged in

Racial and New Left investigations will be familiar with the

contents of this coumunication.

INVESTIGATIONS AND INFORMANT

DEVELOPMENT

Genil

The Black Panther Partyls (BPP) influence is increasing

at a rapid rate; therefore, there is a need for a conference at

the Seat of Government with the racial supervisors handling BPP

activity in the 34 active Panther field divisions in order that

we may analyze our operation for the purpose of insuring that our

program is efficient.

The recent release of Huey P. Newton from jail on bail

has stimulated BPP activity. This coupled with the success of

the Plenary Revolutionary People's Constitutional Convention in

Philadelphia and the forthcoming Revolutionary People's Constitution

al Convention scheduled for Washington, D. C., in November, is

• definitely increasing Panther influence amongst black extremists

as well as white radical extremists.

In addition, the increase Na

we see in violence as exhibited by the bombings, snipings and

general assault on law enforcement, demands that there be a complete

and thorough analyses of our investigative efforts as well as our

efforts. in developing quality informants.

5-275an

Our experience in the past has shown that special

conferences concerning racial activities, especially informant

matters, have been most productive. Based on our past conferences

we initiated a number of instructions to the field and inaugurated

new programs concerning the handling of black extremist investi-

gations and the development of racial informants.

Progress has been made in developing a network of racial

informants throughout the United States and we are getting results:

from our efforts; however, there is an urgent need to develop or.

is also a need to get together with field personnel to iron

our BPP investigative techniques.

In view of this it is believed that we should

MEOH1lWT-A1rE

To secure approval for anonymous mailing of

reproduction of newspaper column critical of Black Panther

Party (BPP).

Victor Riesel, noted labor columnist, recently

authored a column highly critical of the BPP which exposed

their viciousness including cold-blooded attacks on police.

It points out the repeated calls for murder of police that

appear in the Panther newspaper. The column also tells of

a proposal by a union member that union affiliated freight.

handlers refuse to handle the shipment of the BPP newspaper._

At the recently concluded conference of field

supervisors handling BPP matters it was unanimously recommended

that this column be reproduced and anonyously mailed to select

officials of the unions involved in handling shipments of BPP

newspapers as well as selected officials and members of police

fraternal organizations who might be in a position to encourage

such a boycott.

5-Helat

This recommendation has excellent merit. Riesel's

column is outstanding and it provides us with an ideal opportunity

to bring the vicious character of the BPP to the attention of

many officials of unions who are in a position to give impetus

to the suggested boycott of the handling of BPP papers.

Such a boycott, if realized, would be a most effective means

to cut off BPP

finances and propaganda.

that the field be advised on a regular basis of new techniques

ütilized and successes achieved in uüi Countezintelligence

Frogram directed toward black extremists and that the title

of conmunications prepared regarding such Counterintelligence

Program be abbreviated.

Our experience over the past year and the growth

of our knowledge regarding black extremist activities have

resulted in utilization of increasing number of sophisticated

techniques, some of which have involved a number of our field

offices and occasionally Legal Attaches in Canada and Europe.

Among highly successful tangible results realized during the

past year, as a result of this program, were the disbandment

of a Black Panther Party (BEP) front group in Cleveland,

Mississippi; the transfer of an energetic organizer and key

Teader of New Haven Be? chapter to a less influential post

in North Carolina; and the complete disruption of a planned

conference of the violence-prone Republic of New Africa in

Jackson, Mi

Mississippi.

Field supervisors felt discussion at the conference

Field racial supervisors who attended a specialized

abolished since activities of so many AI subjects also

disorder of racial and/or security nature.

Al is a valuable and

necessary administrative tool and it should not be discontinued.

Since inception of AI, the extremist and revolutionary

activities of many agitators have also qualified them for

SI and thus they are included on AI and SI. Listing of

administrative and investigative standpoint at the Bureau and

in the field. To streamline our operations,

it is recommended

those individuals who are also included on SI be deleted from

With the continuing terroristic activities being

supervisors attending the above conference that these matters

should be discussed in detail at In-Service classes.

It was

recognized that these matters are allotted time at the other-

In-Service classes; however, it was felt the threats posed

by extremists in this country justify an entire In-Service

being devoted to these types of investigations.

This In-Service will allow for the Bureau lecturers.

to discuss in detail with a greater number of Special Agents

the problems involved in the racial and new left fields

concerning intensified investigation, acts of violence, informant

development and the necessity for developing sufficient

background data to assist in fugitive investigations when

these extremists become Bureau fugitives.

As previously advised the conference held with

field racial supervisors discussed in detail the terroristic

activities in the United States and in Canada and took cognizance

of the imminent concern of the White House concerning probability

of extremist groups taking action against Government officials

or their families. In addition to the threat posed by many

extremist groups there is always the ever present threat of

a guerrilla-type operation being perpetrated by the clandestine

BPP underground. The White House and the Nation in general

THE ESCAPE ROUTE USED BY BLACK

EXTREMISTS TO FLEE THE UNITED STATES

In light of the above, every field division should

analyze its present racial informants to see if there is a

logical informant who could be used in connection with the

above proposal. This informant should be established in the

black extremist field and particularly established with the

BPP to the degree that the Party would be interested in

assisting him to flee the country. Upon completion of the

review of the present racial informants, every field division

should advise the results of this review.

SUBJECT OPERATION OF A RACIAL TOPORTANT

FOR, THE PURPOSE OF DISCOVERING...

THEXESCAPE ROUTES USED BY BLACK

EXTREMISTS TO FLEE THE UNITED STATES

The purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval

to canvass the field to find a suitable racial informant who

could be utilized as a decay for the purpose of ascertaining the

escape route used by black extremists to flee the United States.

N

The field racial supervisors attending the conference

at the Seat of Government on 10/22-23/70 corcerning Black Panther

Party (BPP) activities took.note of the number of black extremists.

who flee the United States as fugitives. This matter was

discussed in detail and it was proposed that the Bureau select

a trusted racial informant to act as a decoy with the black

extremists for the purpose of ascertaining what escape route

these

extremists use to leave the United States.

After the selection of a suitable racial informant we

would then work up a cover story for the informant which would

make it appear necessary for him to flee the United States because

of fear of action by the authorities. We would then instruct

him to contact an appropriate official in the BPP for the purpose

of obtaining assistance in fleeing the United States. It is

hoped that the BPP contact would then assist our informant in

fleeing the United States by using their previously successful

escape route.

If this was successful, we would then learn of this

route and be able to cut off the avenue black extremists use to

flee this country.

It is anticipated that this conference will cover

the entire range of investigative techniques of BPP members

as well as the development and operation of informants in

the group. Particular emphasis will be placed on obtaining

evidentiary information, the coverage that should be afforded

to Panthers who travel, as well as the development of top

level informants in the BPP.

The attendants at the above conference will be

limited to the racial supervisors handling BPP matters.

Therefore, the recipients of this airtel should advise by

9/21/70 the identity of the racial supervisor handling

Panther investigations who will attend the above conference

as well as specific recommendations for matters to be discussed

concerning BPP investigations and informant matters.

You may assume your candidates have been listed

as recommended unless advised to the contrary. They should

be instructed to report no later than 9:00 a.I. on 10/22/70

• to Room 733 Old Post Office without further instructions.

The Black Panther Party's (BPP) influence is increasing

at a rapid rate; therefore,

there is a need for a conference at

the Seat of Government with the racial supervisors handling BPP

activity in the 34 active Panther field divisions in order that

we may analyze our operation for the purpose of insuring that our

program is efficient.

The recent release of Huey P. Newton from jail on bail

has stimulated BPP activity. This coupled with the success of

the Plenary Revolutionary People's Constitutional Convention in

Philadelphia and the forthcoming Revolutionary People's Constitution

al Convention scheduled for Washington, D. C., in November, is

definitely increasing Panther influence amongst black extremists

as well as white radical extremists.

In addition, the increase

we see in violence as exhibited by the bombings, snipings and

general assault on law enforcement, demands that there be a complete

and thorough analyses of our investigative efforts as well as our

efforts in developing quality informants.

Our experience in the past has shown that special

conferences concerning racial activities, especially informant

matters, have been most productive. Based on our past conferences

we initiated a number of instructions to the field and inaugurated

new programs concerning the handling of black extremist investi-

gations and the development of racial informants.

Progress has been made in developing a network of racial

informants throughout the United States and we are getting results

from our efforts; however, there is an urgent need to develop or

place a quality informant. in the upper echelon of the BPP. There

is also a need to get together with field personnel to iron

out problems, exchange ideas, and expand upon and refine

our BPP investigative techniques.

In view of this it is believed that we should

have a two-day conference at the Seat of Government concerning

BPP investigations and developing informants in the Party.

In order that adequate preparation can be made it is

recommended this conference be held October 22 and 23, 1970. / //

We are limiting this conference to the 34 field divisions

having the majority of BPP investigations and recommending

that the field supervisor from each of these field divisions be

authorized to attend the conference.

RECOMMENDATION:

• That attached airtel to 34 field divisions referred

to above be approved advising that a two-day conference- will

be held in accordance with the above and instructing that each

Special Agent in Charge advise the identity of the field

supervisor who will attend this conference and to submit

suggestions and recommendations concerning matters to be

emphasized at the conference.

beginning to wonder why something isn't being done. Lot kennan,

of Princeton University, whom I have known for some years.

deplored sharply the activities of the Black Panthers, and

wondered why they were not being prosecuted.

To secure approval for anonymous mailing of

reproduction of newspaper column critical of Black Panther

Party (BPP).

Victor Riesel, noted labor columnist, recently

authored a column highly critical of the BPP which exposed

their viciousness including cold-blooded attacks on police.

It points out the repeated calls for murder of police that

appear in the Panther newspaper. The column also tells of

a proposal by a union member that union affiliated freight

handlers refuse to handle the shipment of the BPP newspaper.

At the recently concluded conference of field

supervisors handling BPP matters it was unanimously recommended

that this column be reproduced and anonyously mailed to select

Officials of the unions involved in handling shipments

of BPP

newspapers as well as selected officials and members of police

fraternal organizations who might be in a position to encourage

such a boycott.

5-Helattor

This recommendation has excellent merit. Riesel's

column is outstanding and it provides us with an ideal opportunity

to bring the vicious character of the BPP to the attention of

many officials of unions who are in a position to give impetus

to the suggested boycott of the handling of BPP papers.

Such a boycott, if realized, would be a most effective means

to cut off BPP

tinances and propaganga.

To endorse recommendation of field racial supervisors,

who attended specialized conference at Bureau on 10/22-23/70,

that the field be advised on a regular basis of new techniques

utilized and successes achieved in our Counterintelligence

Frogram directed toward black extremists and that the title

of communications prepared regarding such Counterintelligence

Program be abbreviated.

Our experience over the past year and the growth

of our knowledge regarding black extremist activities have

resulted in utilization of increasing number of sophisticated

techniques, some of which have involved a number of our field

offices and occasionally Legal Attaches in Canada and Europe.

Among highly successful tangible results realized during the

past year, as a result of this program, were the disbandment

of a Black Panther Party (BPP) front group In Cleveland,

Mississippl; the transter of an energetic organizer and key

leader of New Haven BPP chapter to a less influential post

in North Carolina; and the complete disruption of a planned

conference of the violence-prone Republic of New Africa in

Jackson, Mississippi.

Field supervisors felt discussion at the conference

of counterintelligence techniques and successes materially

benefited them and for this reason recommended the field bed 5 3

should materially stimulate ingenuity and illustrate to

field the significant results which can be realized through

an imaginative, dynamic but Bureau-controlled program. For

these reasons, it is felt this recommendation should be

implemented.

The currently used caption for Counterintelligence

caption in instant memorandum, is lengthy and cumbersome.

For these reasons, field supervisors recommended it be

abbreviated Recommended field be instructed to henceforth

utilize the caption.

"COINTCIPRO. - Black Extremists -

Matters" in place of the present caption. Records Branch,

Files and Communications Division, has advised this caption

is not otherwise being utilized. Adoption of this abbreviated

caption also has advantage of affording additional security-

to this program.

ACTION:

-

1. That the field be advised on regular basis of

new techniques utilized and successes achieved.

2. If approved, attached letter will be sent to

42 field offices participating in above Counterintelligence

Black extremists are subjected to a torrent of propaganda

calling for violent action against established authorities. Prime

agitator in that regard is the Black Panther Party (BPP). A

principal means used is extremist films. Recent vastly increased

number of attacks and bombings by blacks against police undoubtedly

due to such propaganda.

With the continuing terroristic activities being

planned and perpetrated by extremist elements (both in thei

black and new left fields) it was the opinion of the racial

supervisors attending the above conference that these matters

should be discussed in detail at In-Service classes. It was

recognized that these matters are allotted time at the other_

In-Service classes; however, it was felt the threats posed

by extremists in this country justify an entire In-Service

being devoted to these types of investigations.

This In-Service will allow for the Bureau lecturers.

to discuss in detail with a greater number of Special Agents

the problems involved in the racial and new left fields

concerning intensified investigation, acts of violence, informant

development and the necessity for developing sufficient

background data to assist in fugitive investigations when

these extremists become Bureau fugitives.

As stated above, it was the opinion of the

supervisors that at least three of these In-Services should be

In connection with the Racial Supervisors' Conference

concerning Black Panther Party (BPP) activities held at the SWak

Seat of Government 10/22-23/70 it was recognized that there

still remains an urgent need for full penetration of extremist

groups in order to obtain information concerning terroristic

activities which may be aimed against Government officials.

Accordingly, there is attached an airtel to all Special Agents

in Charge (SAC) reiterating previous instructions in this matter;

emphasizing the need to accelerate the deveiopment of infornants;;

and, instructing 10 field divisions to assign two Special Agents!

in their respective divisions exclusively to developing racial

informants.

As previously advised the conference held with

field racial supervisors discussed in detail the terroristic

activities in the United States and in Canada and took cognizance

of the imminent concern of the White House concerning probability

of extremist groups taking action against Government officials

or their families. In addition to the threat posed by many

extremist groups there is always the ever present threat of

a guerrilla-type operation being perpetrated by the clandestine

BPP underground. The White House and the Nation in general.

is counting on the FBI to give top priority to the development

of live informants who can report on possible terroristic

activities.

In light of the above, every field division should

analyze its present racial informants to see if there is a

logical informant who could be used in connection with the

above proposal. This informant should be established in the

black extremist field and particularly established with the

BPP to the degree that the Party would be interested in

The purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval

to canvass the field to find a suitable racia intormant who

could be utilized as a decoy for the purpose of ascertaining the

escape route used by black extremists to flee the United States.

The field racial supervisors attending the conference

at the Seat of Government on 10/22-23/70 concerning Black Panther

Party (BPP) activities took note of the number of black extremists

who fiee the United States as fugitives. This matter was

discussed in detail and it was proposed that the Bureau select

a trusted racial informant to act as a decoy with the black

extremists for the purpose of ascertaining what escape. route

these

extremists use to leave the United States.

' After the selection of a suitable racial informant we

would then work up a cover story for the informant which would

make it appear necessary for him to flee the United States because

of fear of

action by the authörities." We would then instruct

him to contact an appropriate official in the BPP for the purpose

of obtaining assistance in fleeing the United States. It is

hoped that the BPP contact wöuld then assist our informant in

fleeing the United States by using their previously successful

escape route. If this was successful, we would then learn of this

route and be able to cut off the avenue black extremists use to

flee this country.

It is felt that such a collection, put out on a menthly

basis, would serve many needs. It would be the most direct

way of revealing the extremity of revolutionary hatred which

these people have attained.

It would expose the viciousness

and subverted aims of the extremists in their own words, devoid

of

the lame excuses of their apologists who claim, especially

in the case of black extremists, that they use a deliberately

manipulated rhetoric to stir favorable response to "social"

needs.

It would prove invaluable as a ready reference for those

who make speeches, those who write speeches

and articles, and

those who seek corroboration of the existence of a deadly force

threatening the security of the United states.

RECOMMENDATION:

That a two page communication, similar to the

enclosed sample, be prepared by the Research Section on a

monthly basis for distribution to all field Offices, appropriate

Government officials and agencies,

foreign contacts, and to

selected press contacts whed deemed appropriate.

MEXORANDUM FOR MR. LADD

Re: Handling/of Codes, Ciphers,

and spronage writings ir

the Laboratory.

In order to facilitate the examination of code

and cipher messages received in the Laboratory in connection with current

cases three files of reference material have been set up. First,

there is a three by five card index file containing on each card one

code word or code number group together with the file reference.

Second, there has been set up a visible file of photographic copies of

code and cipher messages and other espionage writings where the

specinen received in the Laboratory is the original copy written by

the subject of the case.

Third, there is being set up a file

containing photostatic copies of all codes and ciphers received in

current cases for comparison with new material received in the future.

In the three by five index file which has been set up,

there are being placed cards upon which is written the code group

together with the file, serial, and specinen number or numbers of the

original message in which that code group was found. When coded

messages are received in the Laboratory, the code words appearing

therein are first searched in the available code books on hand in the

Laboratory and at the Library of Congress.

In the event it has not

been possible to decode the message by this means, a separate three by

five card is then made out for each code group appearing in the message.

These cards are then placed alphabetically, or numerically, in their

proper position in the three by five card index file. At this time

it is noted whether or not the code group being placed in the file is

already present in the index, and if so the information is all then

incorporated on one card. By this means it will be possible to

determine whether these new code groups have previously appeared in

unsolved messages submitted to the Laboratory in other cases.

By

tying together messages of this sort it will permit a comparison to

ordinarily contain only code groups from unsolved cases.

The exception to this will be code groups found in solved

messages where some sort of private code, not found in code

books, has been used.

The second file which has been set up contains

photographic copies of codes, ciphers and espionage writings

where, through a comparison of handwriting, handprinting, type-

writing, or other visual means, two or more cases may be

connected together. Upon receipt of the new visible file

cabinet for the anonymous letter file a separate section will

be devoted to the filing of these writings in a similar manner

to the filing of

anonymous letters.

When new cases are

received in the Laboratory containing the original code or

cipher message as originally written by the subject or when

original writings are received in connection with espionage

cases, these will be compared with the photographic copies already

in the file. In this way cases may be connected together by

means of handwriting or handprinting identification, by means

of typewriting identification, or by means of the manner of

making the various characters

or symbols appearing in the message.

Material of this kind has been collected since the latter part

of October 1939 and will form the nucleus to be placed in the

visible file when received.

For a ninety day trial period, there is being

set up in the Laboratory a separate file containing photostatic

copies of all code and cipher messages received in the Laboratory

in current cases in order to have this material available to

the examiners for ready reference when examining new cases

containing similar material. This file will not only contain

photostatic copies of messages in the original handwriting or

typewriting as prepared by the subject but will also contain

copies of all codes and ciphers.

This file will provide a

means for comparing messages received in different cases as to

form, destination, addressee, sender, and peculiarities of

construction. This will of course obviate the necessity

of examiners calling for numerous files from the sixth floor

file room or from the Laboratory's files and will provide

a more accurate means of linking messages in different cases

together than merely relying upon an examiner's memory of

previously having seen a similar message.

As the material in

the file accumulates, messages will be segregated according

to similar characteristics.

It is believed that the ninety

day trial period will be sufficient to determine the

practicability of this file and at the expiration of that

period a further memorandum will be submitted.

Cipher naterial submitted by contributors and

having no bearing on any Bureau investigation will be filed

in Bureau file 62-26873 as at the present time. This type of

material will not be included in any of the three files mentionec

above.

RE:

DISCONTINUANCE OF NATIONAL SECURITY FILE

--..

Reference is made to SAC Letter #86, dated September 18,

1945, concerning the discontinuance in the Laboratory of the

National Security File of writings. Your attention is called-to

the fact that at least for the

next six months the file is not

being disassembled, but will be retained in an inactive status in ||

the Laboratory, during which time new entries will not be made.

'It is emphasized that routine searches will not be made.

However,

if, in the supervision of your cases, you feel that special

circumstances warrant 'à search in a particular instance, then an

appropriate request in memorandum form, setting forth full justi-

fication, should be prepared so that the Bureau can pass upon

your request for an exception to the general rule.

Very truly yours,

made to the attached memorandum dated

April 23, 1947, Irom aC. J. A. S1z00 to Nr. RI. Harbo, requesting

the auvice of the Security Livision as to the further usefulness or

disposition of the laboratory National Security file.

It is noted that in the attached memorandom a tabulation

appears stowing that Irom November, 1940, until warch, 1947, there were

25 searcnes conducted of the National security rileland no identifications.

In the last three montins, however, a number ol requests have been made

by the Internal security

Section for searches of this file in connection

particularly with une hussian espionage cases. In addition we are currently.

receiving a nunver of specimens in soviet espionage cases which should be

added to this iile for future comparison purposes.

In view of the extent and importance of Soviet espionage operations

at the present time andin view of the relative paucity of the Bureau's

knowledge thereof, it is believed that the National Security File should

not be discontinued and that, in addition, every eftort should be made to

bui la up this file so that it will contain the greatest possible number

of authentic Soviet espionage documents for future comparisons in connection

with the soviet espionage cases.

In adsition to this, however, it is felt that cousideration

snoula be given by the laboratory at this time to reviewing the national

Sonist of related one to set to a huge ran, non-

Communist or related types of cases where

the spectren is of dethnite intelligence signiti cance Inasmuch as it is known

that during the perion of vorld varia large nuner of specimens were sub-

mitted for the National Security File which presently have no. intellijence

significance whatever.

It is felt, huwever, that those specimens in

the

File wnich are of definite intelligence sig-ificance should be retaired

even though they pertain to verman intelligence opiations which, for all

practical purposes, terminated in 1945.

This file consists of two parts: (1) the Inactive Section, made up

Gandy_

World War II and (2) the Active Section,

started early in 1948, to which is

boing added materiäl submitted in Sovlet Espionage and related Security cases fount.

There are about 23,000 specimens in the Inactive Section and 456 in

the new or Active Section at the present time. Specimens are now added only

to the new section, which has the same general classifications for filing as

the old section.

About 350 individual specimens were searched in the file

during the calendar year 1950, with no identifications made. Approval of Assistant

Director of the Security Division is required before a specimen is searched.

Recently the inactive or old part of the file was reviewed to des

termine which sections could be destroyed without impairing the usefulness of

the file. As a result of this survey, it was recommended that certain non-

communist material, contained in approximately 80 drawers comprising the Miscel-

Laneous Section of the old part of the file, be destroyed. A description of this

material was set forth on page three of a memorandum, dated November 27, 1950,

from hr. Cadigan to hir. Bowles.

In the memorandum from Mr. Hennrich to Mir. Belmont, dated December 5,

1950, the Security Division advises that they have no objection to the destruc-

tion of the material in the Miscellaneous Section which has no soviet, satellite

or communist connection. - Accordingly.this material is being destroyed, with the

exception of certein genuine Selective Service cards. which will be made

SUBJECT:

NATIONAL SECURITY FILE

DATE: January 14, 1952

The purpose of this memorandum is to evaluate the National

Security File as of January I, 1952.

This file consists of two parts: (1) The inactive section which

was built up during World War II and (2) the active section, started early

in 1948 to which is being added material submitted in Soviet espionage

and related security cases. It will be noted that miscellaneous sections

/ of the inactive section containins non-commanist material were destroyed

during the past year. This was done in accordance with the memorandum from

• Hennrich to A. H. Belmont dated December 5, 1950. The remaining

portion of the inactive section no comprises approximately 12,000 specimens.

The active section now contains 667 specimens. Searches in the file require

the approval of an assistant director.

275 specimens were searched in the file in 1951. Five identifications

were made.

The time required for maintaining the file is less than one hour

weekly on the basis of the present rate of adding specimens.

no changes be made at this time.

SAC Letter 186 dated September 18, 1945, advised the Field that

Gandy

active searches in the National Security File would not be made unless warranted

by special circumstances.

Since January 1, 1948, all new material has been added

to a new active section of the National Security File. The inactive section has

remained dormant. The inactive section contains about 16,000 photograph specimens,

mostly "Axis" material added to the file during World War II years.

The active

section contains about 2500 photograph specimens, mostly Communist and Russian

material, and includes hanawriting of all active Communist Key Figures. A review

of the inactive section was made in December, 1947, for the purpose of determining

the feasibility of removing known Communist and Russian material.

The survey showed

that 77.7% of the itens reviewed were innocuous; 9.7% were "rightist" in character.

and of "definite intelligence significance;" 5.5% were clearly "leftist" and 7%

were of such a nature that it was not possible to determine their future value.

It was estimated that about 2000 man hours would be required for review of case

files to determine which specimens could be removed.

Since that time it has not

been deened advisable to spend that much time for such a revier.

Since January I, 1953, only two searches have been made in the inactive

section and no identificationseffected.

Five specimens, all in one case, were

identified in the inactive section in 1951. These specimens were determined to

have been written by a prolific crank letter writer (Bufile 100-109571 serial 6).

No other identifications have been made in the inactive file since October, 1945.

It is believed that the inactive file no longer serves any useful purpose and should

be destroyed. Specimens in this file are photographs, negatives of which are retained,

in the lechanical Section.

The active section of the National Security File has proven of great value

since it was started in 1948. Since that time more than 100 specimens have been

identified in this file, most of which related to subjects active in the Cormunist

Underground.

RECOMMENDATION:

(1) That the inactive section of the National Security

File be destroyed since it no longer has any apparent value and (2) that the active

section be continued since it is of great value in making identifications in security-

type cases.

ADDENDUM: (Espionage Section, 10/13/54 SBD:hmm)

Discussion with FBI Laboratory reveals inactive

section of National Security file constitutes great bulk of

material received during World war II through censorship

intercepts and during period when emphasis on combatting axis

countries.

Active Section started in 1948 and constitutes more

usable material based on present Bureau emphasis on Communism

and soviet and satellite espionage.

Recognized specimens from

old espionage cases placed in Active Section. Searches against

National security File now limited to Active Section in absence of

some indication search of Inactive Section would be worth while.

Recommendation of FBI Laboratory for destruction of Inactive

Section believed feasible for destruction would only result in

elimination of photographs. Original material and negatives

would still be available for specific comparisons.

alternative would be to review Inactive section piece by piece

(estimated 2000 man nours required) to include selected

photographs in Active Section and this not believed economical

for value possibly derived. Recommend views of Internal Security

section also be secured.

ADDENDUL: (Internal Security Section, 10/13/54 PIC:mj*)

The Internal Security section agrees with the

recommendation of the FBI Laboratory that the inactive

section of the National security file be destroyed and

resulted from the

searches.

During 1960, a special section of the National Security

File was set up to contain samples of typewriters of the Soviet

and Satellite establishments in those field offices which have

established as a source typewriter repair shops which service

these typevriters. SAC letter number 59-56 instructed all field

offices having Soviet or Satellite establishments within their

division to consider this program of cultivating typewriter

repair shops in order that complete coverage can be maintained.

The National Security File is valuable in elininating :

or identifying suspects believed to be active in Communist

activities and

. in determining sources of Communist and espionage

type writings.

The file is up-to-date.

RECOMMENDATION:

Continue maintenance of the file.

SUBJECT:

NATIONAL SECURITY FILE

PURPOSE:

NTW

55154

To recommend a procedure

for removing obsolete material

from the National Security File.

BACKGROUND:

The file was started in 1940 and originally contained

writings pertaining to espionage and security matters.

During

contained approximately 20,000 specimens. Most of this was

"Nazi" material, but also included were some specimens Irom

Russian espionage cases such as the Alto case, Comrad, Mocase,

Cinrad, etc.

In 1945 aîter V-J Day the file was declared inactive

due to the äbsence of any frequent need to search or make additions

to the file.

In 1948 an active section of the file was reinstituted

and

specimens only from soviet, satellite, and Communist type cases

were added to the file and searches were made.

As a result of a review in 1951 to determine whether

the inactive part of the file could be destroyed, a decision to

destroy all material in the miscellaneous section, except those

items related to

Soviet, Satellite, or Communist cases, was approved.

A further review in 1954 resulted in approval to destroy the entire

inactive section of the file with the exception of approximately 100

specimens recognized as still potentially valuable in certain Russian, 8

Communist-type cases.

These specimens were placed in the active .

section of the file.

Although discussions have been held with representatives

of the Domestic Intelligence Division concerning need for purging

the file, no review of the file has been made for this purpose

Since 1954:.

However, it is believed that some plan should be

instituted to remove

those items that have no apparent present

or potential value.

It is realized that handwriting of

subjects or suspecis and typewriters avrilable to such individuals

may be of value in our investigations as long as their lifetime.

Therefore, no definite perica can be set for all cases as the

length of

time a specimen should remoin in the file. This fact

points up the need to review each

case file where consideration is

being given to removing a specimen.

Since it is felt that the file should contain only useful

material to make its operation most efficient and since an effort

should be made to keep the ile from growing out of bounds, the

following recommendotions are boing made.

1.

That within ihe next 1z months (through June, 1962)

350 of the oldest specimens in the file be reviewed

for possible removal. 350 represents the average

number of specimens added to the file per year over

These 350 specimens may not

represent as many as 350 case files since more than

2.

That the number of specimens reviewed for possible

removal each 12-month. period represents the average

number of specimens added to the file since its

beginning in 1948.

On this basis all of the specimens

added in 1948 and

1949 and some of the specimens

added in 1950 will be revieved in the first 12-month

period.

3.

That the Laboratory examiner assigned to the case

consult with the substantive Domestic Intelligence

Division supervisor if he believes the specimen

may be removed.

If the substantive supervisor

agrees, the Laboratory examiner should remove the

specimen from the file.

That each specimen removed be returned to the case

iile only it another copy is not in Ille or a

negative is not available from which a copy can be

available

made. Otherwise, the specimen removed may be

destroyed.

5.

That each specimen revieved

and retained in the

National security File be marked on the back

"Reviewed - 19E1," etc.

6.

That each specimen reviewed and retained in the

file be again considered for removal in

15 years.

7.

That the procedure as outlined above be revieved

in July, 1904, and that any changes necessary be

recommended at that time.

noted, however, as in Chicago airtel of May 21, 1968, that

GREGORY also faces a five month sentence, Cook County Jail,

Chicago, as a result of the upholding of criminal charges

against

him, by the Illinois Appellate Court, of. 1965 charges

in connection with a local demonstration.

Chicago also has under consideration the review

of federal income tax returns of HERBERT C. MOHAMMED, Since he

pin-pointed as a counterintelligence target in Chicago

airtel April 22, 1968; under the above caption, and that of the

¡ Nation of Islam

(NOI).

• These returns; referred to in Bureau letter May 15,

1968,

have not as yet been received by Chicago, however, upon receipt,

and subsequent review, a specific recommendation regarding

counterintelligence action will. be submitted.

In previous Chicago communications under above

caption, Chicago has identified ROBERT BROWN, local Student

Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) official, as a

possible target of counterintelligence action, with reference

to his possible removal from an active role as a result of his

refusal to cooperate with Selective Service officials over his

imminent induction into the Armed

Forces

Although not a counterintelligence measure as such,

Chicago has vigorously followed and pursued this situation,

both with Selective Service and the Office of the United States

Attorney. Recently BROWN refused to be inducted, his file is

in the process of being forwarded by Selective Service to the

United States

Attorney (USA), who has advised BROWN's case

will be brought before the Federal Grand Jury at the earliest

possible moment. The USA has advised that a warrant for the

arrest of BROWN, on above charges, will in all probability be

- shortly forthcoming. Unquestionably this would serve-to

further inhibit local SNCC activities, and hopefully, would

in some measure serve to neutralize BROWN himself.

Chicago also feels that the Chicago Firearms

Registration Ordinance, which went into effect May 15, 1968,

has definite potential

as a counterintelligence device, to be

directed against local militants,

as for example RUSS MEEK.

MEEK is known to have purchased 13 diffeent firearms since January,

1967, and it would appear highly unlikely these guns, if still

in his possession, have been registered.

In addition to the

Chicago ordinance,

a state law which requires registration of

all persons possessing firearms will go into effect September 1,

1968.

The penalty for violation of the local ordinance is a

fine, for violation of the state law, a $1,000 fine and a

year incarceration.

Contact with the local office of gun registration has

reflected that it will be approximately another 45-60 days before

records are organized and alphabetized.

MEEK is identified as

a possible target in this regard, however, there would appear to

be a number. öf militants who may well be vulnerable.

• As the Bureau has cautioned, Chicago assures that

each specific future counterintelligence operation will be

submitted for. Bureau approval prior to taking any action.

2. Operations Being Effected

Chicago at present has no counterintelligence operation

in progress, however, as noted will develop such, directed

toward HERBERT MOHAMMED, upon receipt of his tax returns from

the Bureau.

The impetus being provided to the efforts to expedite

the handling of ROBERT BROWN's Selective Service case is not a

counterintelligence operation in the normal sense of the term,

arising as it does from a substantive violation of

125.

However, the end result, that of reducing the

-Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

There have been no significant developments. in

this field since my airtels of April 22, 1968, which would

materially alter programs and approach previously suggested.

Chicago appreciates, however, that changing times and deve op-

nents in the general RM field can have an influence on any

counterintelligence operation.

Chicago will remain alert

to any such development, and when any situation arises,

relative to an individual or organization, which offers

promise and potential

as a counterintelligence operation,

an appropriate communication will be promptly submitted.

It might also be noted that in general, the

assessment of the local black nationalisi muvement, us set

out

in our airtel of April 22, 1968, under the above caption,

remains as noted. It was pointed out that GREGORY had threatened

to disrupt the Democratic National Convention, in August, 1968,

however,

as the Bureau 1s aware, he has cancelled his demonstration

plans for before and during this convention, and is currently

incarcerated.

Chicago assures the Bureau that full and continuing

attention is devoted to this aspect of our operat ion, its

potential

value is well appreciated and this office will remain

alert and

receptive to any opportunity to accomplish and

establish a productive counterintelligence operation.

Re Bureau airtel 3/4/68; and Chicago letter

Set forth below is the periodic progress letter

requiredd concerning captioned matter, as requested in

referenced Bureau airtel under captionas instructed.

1. Operations Under Consideration

Subsequent to the above referenced Chicago

communication, this office has had several counterintelligence

operations under consideration. A reviey of the income

tax returns of HERBERT MOHAMMeD, one of the heads of the

Nation of Islam (NOI), has been completed, HERBERT MOHAMED

having been earlier designated by Chicago

as a primary

counterintelligence target.

It was determined, however,

through this review that this individual appears to have

submitted accurate income tax returns for the past several

years and the anticipated counterintelligence approach on

this basis was judged to be inappropriate.

Several additional counterintelligence approaches

to the NOI have subsequently be considered, in reference to

NOI units in San Antonio and Phoenix; however, for reasons

set forth in Chicago communications of October 4, 1968 and

October 16, 1968, under the above caption, such activities

as considered were deemed to be inadvisable.

In relation to the NOI specifically, Chicago

continually monitors closely the activities of this

group with the end in view of developing effective

counterintelligence techniques directed at either the organization

or its leadership. In the event an opportunity arises where

a productive counterintelligence measure appears in

un petties of such

order, Chicago will immediately submit specifics of such

approach for the Bureau's approval.

Reference has been made in the above referred to

Chicago communication to the state and local Gun Ownership

and Registration Ordinanceswhich appear to render such

possession or ownership on the part of black nationalists

a vulnerable area in the event information exists that they

are in possession of firearms illegally.

Chicago is in

the process of initiating a file review

concerning such

selected cases,

the results of this review to be utilized

in a close check of the records of both sate and local law

enforcement and regulatory agencies. The records of these

agencies have only just recently been determined as having been

placed in order for an effective review along these lines to

be made.

Many of these militants are known in the past to have

been in possession of weapons and where information can be

developed reflecting that they are currently in possession

of firearms, or are suspected of being in possession of fire-

arms, appropriate liaison will be exploited to utilize these

statutes to the extent possible against the militants in

question.

Such a program will be submitted to the

Bureau for approval, prior to any specific such action being

taken by Chicago.

Chicago continues to closely follow the activities

•I ROBERT BROWN, referred to in referenced letter of

July 2, 1968, as a primary counterintelligence target. He

was recently

turned down for military service and

consequently will continue to be active locally.

He is the

former head of the Chicago and Midwest group of the Student

Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and most recently

has indicated his conversion to or formation of a local

branch of the Black Panther Party, headquartered in Oakland,

This is a very recent development and the extent

of the organization oi this group in terms of membership and

possible influence locally is as yet difficult to establish.

This situation was jeferred to at some length in a Chicago

communication

under

the above caption, Octoberla, 1968, and

the situation is

relatively unchanged from that time.

In addition, however,

a Chicago racial source

close to BROWN has advised that he has recently expressed a

desire to "take over" the remains of the Chicago Chapter of

the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), this group having

been expelled from National CORE in early October, 1968.

This expulsion came about as a result of a September, 1968,

walkout on the part of the Chicago Chapter from the National

CORE Convention held in St. Louis, Missouri.

BROWN and the head of the local CORE group, ROBERT

LUCAS, have never been friendly and BROWN had stated his desire

to remove LUCAS from the leadership of this group and place it

under the Black Panther Party banner, meaning by this under his

own leadership.

To complicate this situation somewhat; however,

this former CORE group,

under the leadership of LUCAS, has only

recently organized itself into a new black organization calling

itself Black Liberation Alliance, formed at the national

meeting held over the weekend of

october 18-20, 1968, at

Columbus, Ohio. BROWN

did not attend this affair and the position

he will take as a result of this development is not yet clear.

It is believed, however, that this situation,

-3 -

• NW 55154 Docid: 32989639 Page 260

---

## Page 261

CG 157-2209

due in large measures to the friction among personalities

involved, offers some opportunity for exploitation under a

counterintelligence approach.

At present, the situation

appears to be too formative and nebulous for a specific

technique to be intelligently developed.

In short regarding the above situation, within

a period of little more than a month, the Chicago CORE

Chapter, together with a rather limited number of adherents an

other cities, has moved from a coRe group in good standing

to a new and somewhat organized black group.

It would appear

that the early stages of the development of

this group

would offer a good opportunity to inhibit its effectiveness

and as soon as chicago can analyze the situation and

develop what appears an effective approach,

a specific

recommendation for a counterintelligence action will be

submitted for Bureau approval.

JAMES HARVEY, a male Negro, age 22, the founder

and organizer of the Afro-Anerican Students Association was

also referred to in referenced Chicago letter as a likely

counterintelligence target. An analysis of his most recent

activities would reflect that he is at present in a position

where he might well be vulnerable to a well thought out

counterintelligence approach.

He has, until very recently,

engaged

in no significant local militant activities;

however, within the past month has emerged as a principal

"adult advisor" to several individuals and black youth

groups instrumental in the organization and implementation of

black student boycotts and unrest generally within the Chicago

Public School System. HARVEY operates principally

out of

the Umoja (unity) Black Students Center on Chicago's south

side and appears to have been a substantial influence on this

movement which has been of significant success in terms of its

effect on schools in Chicago's ghetto community. In

consideration of counterintelligene approaches to HARVEY;

-attention will be devoted to his travel to Czechoslovakia

during 1968, as well as his summer of 1968 travel to Japan

where he reportedly was in contact with communist orientated

student and youth groups.

During 1968 it was also determined

that HARVEY in the past has advised his local draft board of

homosexual activities on his part, which activities have

served as the basis for his exclusion from military service.

It appears possible that the above as well as adaitional

past activities on his part might well be utilized in

possibly compromising him and to some extent the black school

boycott movement with which he is to some extent involved.

Again, prior to the inception of any counterintelligence

activities, Chicago will submit a specific recommendation to

the Bureau

for its approval.

2. Operations Being Effected

No counterintelligence operations are currently

in progress in this field in Chicago; however, as the

information set forth previously would reflect, Chicago

anticipates that very shortly recommendationsto initiate such

operations will be forthcoming.

3. Tangible Results

No tangible

results have as yet been forthcoming

since the inception of this program in the black nationalist

field.

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

Information reflecting on this captioned subject

matter has been referred to in large measure under the first

item above.

In short, however, the most significant

developments locally would appear to be represented in the

expulsion of Chicago CORE from the national group with the

development of a new black nationalist organization involving

these former members of CORE; development-ofca local Chapter of the Blac

Panther Party and a possible rivalry between this group and

the leader of the new black organization referred to previously;

the emergence of the high school age black student groups

at the present as the most violent and possibly militant

black groups active locally.

Attempts to develop an effective

counterintelligence approach locally are consequently being

directed at these areas of development.

The Chicago black nationalist scene generally

continues to be a fragmented one, characterized by a number

of small and relatively ineffective groups and individuals,

none of whom have indicated a willingness or ability to

work together or to polarize these to some extent competitive

groups into a united front-type organization or grouping. Chicago

feels that through an effective and well thought out counter-

intelligence approach, it may be possible to develop programs

which will in some measure contribute to the

continuation of this situation

and prevent the emergence

locally of a group or individual who may serve as a unifying

force within the black nationalist grouping.

Chicago will

remain continually alert to explore and exploit every avenue

for possible counterintelligence activities directed at the

black nationalist field which appears to hold potential for

accomplishing this end. Any such development or technique

will be immediately made available to the Bureau for its

consideration and approval prior to inception by Chicago.

BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUP

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

Re Chicago letter (quarterly progress) dated 10/25/68.

Set forth hereinafter is the periodic progress

letter concerning captioned matter, as requested in Bureau

airtel dated March 4, 1968; under the captions as instructed:

1) Operations Under Consideration

On a continuing

basis Chicago is in the process of

analyzing and considering the constantly changing local

Black Nationalist situation from the viewpoint of the

development of

an effective counterintelligence program.

At the present time emphasis is being placed upon the develop-

ing Black

Panther Party (BPP) group which has only recently

opened offices on Chicago's west side and which is now actively

recruiting and establishing itself as a functional organization..

locally.

This situation remains somewhat fluid and as yet

no specific counterintelligence program has been developed

for this reason.

As an example, in the initial stages here of the

establishment of the BPP group there was conflict between

rival factions, one recognized by the parent organization.in

Oaklana, California, the other unsanctioned. The rivalry

between such militantly orientated persons briefly threatened

to erupt into physical confrontation on several occasions,

however, before this situation could be exploited the problem

was resolved

and the group merged under the leadership of

ROBERT BROWN, former focal leader of the Student Non Voilent

Coordinating Committee,

The personalities which have sub-

sequently emerged as dominant within the BPP locally are,

in

addition to BROWN, ROBERT RUSH, FRED HAMPTON, Maywood, Illinois,

and DREW FERGUSON.

on the BPP, anticipates the submission of such communication

on or prior to December 16, 1968.

By letter November 22, 1968, Chicago submitted specific

counter intelligence recommendations concerning JAMES HARVEY,

local Black Nationalist personality, who has most recently

been an influential advisor to young black students in Chicago

who have been involved in student boycotts on the high school

level. No response as yet has been forthcoming and Chicago

will take no action regarding the recommendations submitted

without prior Bureau approval.

Chicago is continuing to attempt

to isolate instances regarding local Black Nationalists who

have been in possession of firearms in the past and who appear

to possibly be in violation of local and state firearms

provisions. It is anticipated that such a review will be

completed shortly and where appropriate, communication will

be submitted to the Bureau with specific recommendations

contained therein. It appears in some instances however, that

action in this regard may be taken locally which is not

purely

counter intelligence in nature.

An example of

such was the recent instance where in

connection with a review of background information concerning

JEFF FORT, loCal leader of the Blackstone Rangers, south side

Chicago Negro gang it was determined that a warrant was out-

standing for FORt for failure to pay a fine of $50,00 on a

disorderly conduct conviction.

In conversation with the

personnel of the Chicago Police Department, Gang Intelligence

Unit,

this information was made available and it was agreed

that if an arrest warrant for FORT was executed at his residence,

a search could then be made of the premises and contraband

such as firearms or narcotics might possibly be located.

This was in fact done, as set forth in Chicago airtel

and letterhead memorandum of December 9, 1968, under the

caption JEFF FORT, Contempt of Congress, Miscellaneous -

Information Concerning.

When the arrest warrant was served on

FORT a search was made

by Police Department representatives

of the premises at his residence and a .22 caliber four shot

derringer pistol was located.

As a result FORT was subsequently

charged with having an unregistered

weapon in his possession

as well as Unlawful Use of a Weapon. He is scheduled to appear

in court on December 18, 1968, to answer to these charges.

It might.also be noted in passing that chicago continues to

maintain

periodic contact-with Source

approved by the Bureau for counterintelligence

usage sómetime ago, but primarily against the NOI. These

contacts have been amplified recently by virtue primarily of

changing times and events to embrace the Black Nationalist

field generally.

The contacts with SOURCe, informal in nature,

are considered to have been directly responsible for recent

statements by him, widely reported in the Chicago press

critical of gang influences in the Ghetto as well as

diack Nation se roy a the tay so described by him as

It is felt SouRCe will certainly continue to speak

out in such fashion and the contact by Chicago productive

of such will continue.

In referenced Chicago letter reference was made to

possible friction between ROBERT BROWN, above, and ROBERT

. LUCAS,

the latter the National head of

the newly formed Black

Liberation Alliance (BLA). Since referenced letter no significant

developments have taken place in this regard and no further

information has been developed reflecting any interest on the

part of BROYN in this group.

The BLA holds regular meetings,

however, to date less than 10 individuals have actually joined

the organization, its activities limited almost exclusively to

these meetings and to such activities as literature distribution.

At the present time BLA appears to be floundering and to have

no real or apparent support within the Negro community or from

Black Nationalists in particular.

It is felt a counterintelligence

interest at this time in the BLA is not warranted.

2) Operations Being Effected

Reference has previously been made to the periodic

contact with Source

to this end.

It has also been

noted that Chicago is awaiting Bureau authority to implement

a counterintelligence program against JAMES HARVEY.

RECOME-

mendations regarding HARVEY were submitted on November 22, 1968.

• 3

Chicago also will continue to selectively advise

local authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists

appear vulnerable to arrest on local charges, in instances

where such information is either not available or apparent

to them.

This is in reference to such instances as that set

forth previously involving JEFF FORT.

3) Tangible Results

In this regard, the remarks of SouRce

alluded

to previously and the arrest of FORT both appear as tangible

results of Chicago counterintelligence activity.

1) Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

• The principal development locally, subsequent to

referenced letter, would appear to be the emergence of the

BPP Chapter referred to previously under the leadership of

ROBERT BROWN and his associates.

The question of the ability

of this group to provide a unifying and polarizing influence

within the local Black Nationalist community remains to be

seen.

Chicago will very closely follow the development and

activities of this group, through knowledgeable BPP sources,

and will submit counterintelligence suggestions in the bi-monthly

letter requested by the

Bureau as instructed.

Set forth hereinafter is the periodic progress

letter concerning captioned matter, as directed in Bureau

airtel March 4, 1968, under the

captions as instructed:

1. Operations Under Consideration

Since the above referenced letter, Chicago has

continued to closely follow local developments in the Black

Nationalist field,

with the development of effective counter

intelligence techniques constantly in mind. Although all

facets of Black Nationalist activities and groups are so

considered, the local Black Panther Party (BPP) chapter and

its activities continue to receive particular attention.

This

BPP, as:well as the volatile nature of the individuals

Chicago is under Bureau instructions to submit on

a two-week basis a counterintelligence proposal regarding

the BPP, and since referenced letter a number of specific

proposals have been submitted and approved. Chicago has

prepared and mailed four separate anonymous communications,

concerning JAMES PHILIP HARVEY (approved Bureau letter

and reported on

EVeNT

and was

the object of an attempt by an official of the NOI to

REWARd

as a token of NOI appreciation of

articles relative to the organization.

The purpose of

our previous contacts with RepirteR in this connection was

to provide him with background information relative to

the non-religious aspects of the NOI, its business

ventures and financial dealings.

At the NOI Convention, and subsequent thereto,

NoI officials have made statements critical of MALCOLM X,

describing him as an example, as one of "the worst enemies"

of the Muslims, meaning by inference black people. A

story regarding these attacks on MALCOLM at the convention

was authored byRepirteR

PAPER

A highly placed Chicago source in the NOI,

namely informaNT has since advised that the NOI attacks

on MALCOLM have generally produced unfavorable results

within the Negro community on the south side, particul rly

since the NOI in many quarters is still regardedas responsible

for the death of MALCOLM.

accordingly, chiage wall shortly submit, by

separate communication,, Bureau authority to recontact

ReporteR relative to possibilities of further exploiting

the NOI attacks on NALCOLM, directed at further reflecting

unfavorable reaction toward the NOI..

At present Chicago has no further specific

counterintelligence proposals under consideration. Another

letter regarding the BPP, however, is due for submission

Barch 24, 1969.

2. Operations Being Effected and

Tangible Results Obtained

Reference has previously been made to the

specific counterintelligence actions initiated by

Chicago. As yet no information has been received by

Chicago reflecting tangible results of these actions..

NW 55154 DocId: 32989639

Page, 269

## Page 270

CG 157-2209

detailed analysis of the use of RePoRteR

was set forth in Chicago airtel of February 17,

1969.

In short, it was noted that the NOI was shown

publicly as more of a business than a religious group,

and articles authored by him may have had the effect of

rendering NOI officials vulnerable to robbery efforts,

as in the case of RAYMOND SHARRIEF, Supreme Captain,

Fruit of Islam, February 4, 1969. The continuing use of

ReporteR is being considered.

Chicago has also continued to advise local

authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists,

particularly BPP members, appear vulnerable to arrest

on local charges.

Along these lines Chicago letter of

February 10; 1969, set forth specific information whereby

FRED HAMPTON, LoCal BPP officer, was arrested just prior

to a television appearance, through efforts of

a Chicago

BPP source and Chicago Special Agents.

inut

The arrest was an

effective source oi embarrassment to the BPP: nowever.

SAMPTON was subsequently found innocent, in jury trial.

of the mob action charges for which he had been arrested.

Additionally, information has regularly been

disseminated by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local

dissemination in instances where Chicago BPP subjects have

travelled elsewhere. Specifically local BPP subjects have

on several occasions journeyed to the. University of

Illinois, Champaign, Illinois, and their activities there

have resulted in numerous arrests.

Prior knowledge of

the presence of these subjects, their purposes and

•identities, have been of great

value in alerting local

authorities

to the potential for violence represented.

One of those local BPP members arrested in

Springfield was determined to be on probation on local

Chicago charges.

Inasmuch

as the arrest represented a

violation of this probation, the information regarding

the arrest was made available to the appropriate Chicago

Police authorities, and probation authorities. Unfortunately,

both expressed a lack of interest in taking any action

"As in the recent past, the most significant

CG 157-2209

It might be noted at this point that Chicago

continues

to regard the local BPP as the focal point for

counterintelligence in this field. The letter of June 17,

1969, requests Bureau authority to attempt to publicize

cartoon depictions of the BPP in a subservient position

to the SDS.

Within recent weeks a relatively small, but highly

vocal group of young Puerto Ricans has emerged in the

Spanish speaking community, utilizing the name Young Lords.

Essentially a youth or street gang in nature, it has adopted

the pose of a political

organization, and an

affiliation

with the BPP has arisen.

It appears

that the real nature

of this group, and

those associated with it, are not generally

recognized by

the responsible elements in the community,

and the file of this group, and of those persons in and

associated with it, are being

reviered with the end of

developing

a suitable counterintelligence program. A

recommendation will be provided the Bureau in the event an

effective action can be formulated.

2. & 3. Operations being Effected and Tangible Results

Obtained

Chicago at present has in effect the program

authorized by the Bureau May 21, 1969, to instruct selected

BPP informants for use in creating a rift between the

BPP and SDS. It is as yet to early to determine what, 1f

any, effect will be forthcoming.

This program additionally

has become somewhat complicated by the disruption which has

been created in the bep locally by the June 4, 1969, raid of

the Chiago Office on the BPP headquarters, and subsequent

Chicago Police Department arrests of some sixteen BPP members,

on a variety of local charges.

his program is being pursued very carefully,

in light of the Bureau's observations in letter of May 21,

1969. Tangible results subsequently obtained will be provided

the Bureau.

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

The emergence of the Young Lords has been

previously referred to.

Also of interest is the

disruption of the regular and normal functioning

of the BPP, through eifective and vigorous enforCe

ment of criminal

statutes violated by them on a local

and

I federal level.

Most recent information from BPP

sources reflects the organization to be purging its

ranks, in an effort to weed out infiltrators; also

reflects that there may be beginning to emerge in lower

LeveLs oI Bly ranks a dissatistaction with the current

leadership.

This

and where

a counterintelligence avenue appears to offer

itself, a suitable recommendation will be forthcoming.

No counterintelligence action will be taken

by Chicago without Bureau approval.

In recent weeks a highly vocal group of young

Puerto Ricans calling themselves the Young Lords have

undertaken action in the north side Puerto Rican neighborhood.

This group is basically a youth gang, however, they have become

active in neighborhood matters particularly urban renewal

problems for the area. Information available concerning the

Young Lords and its

leaders is being reviewed with the end

in mind of the possibility of developing a suitable counter-

intelligence program concerning this group. When and it a

suitable recommendation is developed, such will be provided

to the Bureau in the event an effective action can be

formulated.

2 and 3. OPERATIONS BEING EFFECTED AND TANGIBLE

RESULTS OBTAINED

Chicago at present has in effect the program

authorized by the Bureau July 31, 1969, to mail

copies

of cartoons prepared to further efforts to create a rift

between the BPP and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).

It is, as yet, too early to determine what, if any, effect

will be forthcoming.

This program is being pursued very carefully, in

light of the Bureau's observations in letter of July 31, 1969.

Any tangible results subsequently obtained will be provided

the Bureau.

DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INTEREST

The recent

statement of DAVID HILLIARD, BPP, Chief

of staff, that the BPP will take action against SDS if they

make "one more counter-revolutionary statement" would appear

to indicate a widening of a rift between the BPP and

SDS.

•This situation will be followed closely and where a

counterintelligence effort would appear to have reasonably

tangible potential, a suitable recommendation will be

submitted.

No counterintelligence action will be taken by

Chicago without Bureau approval.

Operations Being Effected and

Tangible Results Obtained

Reference has previously been made to the

specific counterintelligence actions initiated by

Chicago. No information has been received reflecting

tangible results of these

actions.

Chicago has also continued to advise local

authorities of instances where BPP members appear

vulnerable to arrest on local charges.

In this regard,

Chicago letter to the Bureau dated November 21, 1969,

captioned "Black Panther Party (BPP), RM" is concerned

with the location

in Chicago of weapons reportedly

purchased legally by local BPP members. This infor-

mation has been furnished to local law

enforcement

officials.

Officials of the Chicago Police Department

have advised that the department is currently planning

a positive course of action relative to this information.

Information has regularly been disseminated

by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local dissemination

in instances where Chicago BPP have travelled elsewhere.

Local BPP members

have made a number of trips to

Illinvis State University at Normal. Illinois. Prior

knowledge of the

presence of these subjects, their

identities and purpose of trip has been of value in

alerting local authorities to

the potential for

violence represented.

IV. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

Recently FRED HAMPTON, Deputy Chairman,

Illinois BPP and BOBBY LEE RUSH, Deputy Minister

chairmer of

of

Defense, called a general meeting of the Chicago Branch

of the BPP at which time HAMPTON announced that

everyone, but himself and RUSH, were purged from the BPP.'

A counterintelligence recommendation was

submitted by letter dated November 25, 1969, relative

to this action.

This situation

is being followed closely and

where any further counterintelligence avenue appears

likely a suitable recommendation will be made.

Chicago continues to advise local authorities of

instances where

BPP members appear vulnerable to arrest on

local charges.

Information has regularly been disseminated by

Chicago to other Bureau offices for local dissemination in

instances where Chicago BPP members have traveled elsewhere.

Prior knowledge of the presence of BPP members in their

areas has been of value in alerting local authorities to

the potentialfor violence that the presence of BPP members

represents.

IV. DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INTEREST

There are no current developments concerning the

Illinois Chapter of the BPP which would appear to have reason-

able potential for counterintelligence activity.

Regarding the remainder of local Black Nationalist

groups and individuals, their activity is tragmented ana

limited.

Chicago continues to follow such activity in the

event information is developed which would indicate a counter-

intelligence effort would appear to have reasonable potential.

Set forth below, under captions as instructed in

regarding captioned matter.

1. Operations Under Consideration

in accordance mith racont instrictione foom the

Bureau (re Bulet, 5/15/68) Chicago has been directing

consideration to DICK GREGORY as a counterintelligence target

As the Bureau is aware GREGORY is currently incarcerated in/

the

State of Washington, serving a 90 day sentence based

on his!

activities in behalf of Indian fishing rights.

The Chicago Office has organized a counterintelligence

: "team"

, made up of SA's experienced in RM and SM - C investigations

including SA's with lengthy prior counterintelligence experience.

This group, together with the RM Supervisor, and the SA

responsible for the coordination of this program, have devoted

considerable effort to methods of inhibiting the effectiveness

and credability of GREGORY. His file has been thoroughly and

exhaustively reviewed to this end.

The possibility has been

noted that, in the final analysis, an individual such as

GREGORY, so prone to erratic statements and actions, to such wild

and obviously ridiculous charges, will in all probability

destroy his own influence in this field and serve as a

self-neutralizer.

potential, however, subsequent investigation, as in Legat, -

credence to GREGORY's use,

or receipt of funds from abroad,

primarily to have been utilized against the Democratic Convention,

August, 1968, in Chicago.

Chicago is continuing to give the matter of discrediting

GREGORY top priority, and Bureau authority will be promptly

requested at the earliest opportunity in the event a specific

counterintelligence device is formulated. It might also be

noted, however, as in Chicago airtel of May 21, 1968, that

GREGORY also faces a five month sentence, Cook County Jail,

Chicago, as a result of the upholding of criminal charges

against

him, by the Illinois Appellate Court, of. 1965 charges

in connection with a local demonstration.

Chicago also has under consideration the review

of federal income tax returns of HERBERT. C. MOHAMMED, since he

was pin-pointed as a counterintelligence target in. Chicago

• Nation of Islam (NOI):

These returns, referred to in Bureau letter May 15, 1968,

have not as yet been received by Chicago, however, upon receipt,

and subsequent review, a specific recommendation regarding

counterintelligence action will be submitted.

• In previous Chicago communications under above

caption, Chicago has identified ROBERT BROWN, local Student

Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) official, as a

possible target of counterintelligence action, with reference

to his possible removal from an active role as a result of his

refusal

to cooperate with Selective Service officials over his

imminent induction into the Armed Forces.

Although not a counterintelligence measure as such,

Chicago has vigorously followed and pursued this situation,

both with Selective Service and the Office of the United States

Attorney. Recently BROWN refused to be inducted, his file is

in the process of being forwarded by Selective Service to the

United States Attorney (USA), who has advised BROWN's case

will be brought before the Federal Grand Jury at the earliest

possible moment. The USA has advised that a warrant for the

arrest of BROWN, on above charges, will in all probability be

shortly forthcoming Unquestionably this would serve ta

further inhibit local SNCC activities, and hopefully, would

in some measure serve to neutralize BROWN himself.

Chicago also feels that the Chicago Firearms

Registration Ordinance, which went into effect May 15, 1968,

has definite potential

as a counterintelligence device, to be

directed against local militants, as for example RUSS. MEEK.

MEEK is known to have purchased 13 diffeent firearms since January,

1967, and it would appear highly unlikely these guns, if still

in his possession, have been registered.

In addition

• to the

Chicago ordinance,

a state law which requires registration of

all persons possessing firearms will go into effect September 1,

1958.

The penalty for violation.of the local ordinance is a

$500

fine. for violation of the state law, a $1,000 fine and a

year incarceration.

.*..

Contact with the local office of gun registration has

reflected that it will be approximately another 45-60 days before

records are organized and alphabetized.

MEEK is identified as

a possible target in this regard, however, there would appear to

be a number -öf

militants who may well be vulnerable.

As the Bureau has cautioned, Chicago assures that

each specific future counterintelligence operation will be

submitted for Bureau approval prior to taking any action.

2. Operations Being Effected

Chicago at present has no counterintelligence operation

in progress, however, as noted will develop such, directed

toward HERBERT MOHAMMED, upon receipt of his tax

returns from

the Bureau.

The impetus being provided to the efforts to expedite

the handling of ROBERT BROWN's Selective Service case is not a

counterintelligence operation in the normal sense of the term,

arising as it does from a substantive violation of federal

law.

and

However, the end result, that of reducing the effectiveness

hampering the activities of BROWN, is tantamount to that

shich might be achieved through any such operation with BROWN

as 1ts target.

Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

There have been no significant developments in

this field since my airtels of April 22, 1968, which would

materially alter programs and approach previously suggested.

Chicago appreciates, hovever, that changing times and develOp-

ments in the general RM field can have an influence on anj

counterintelligence operation. Chicago will remain alext

to any such development,

and when any situation arises,

relative to an individual or organization, which offers

promise and potential as a counterintelligence operation,

an appropriate communication will be promptly submitted.

It might also be noted that in general, the :

assessment of the local black nationalist nuvemeni, as set

out in our airtel of April 22, 1968, under the above Caption,

• remains as noted. It was pointed out that GREGORY had threatened

to disrupt the Democratic National Convention, in August, 1968,

however, as the Burau is aware, he has cancelled his demonstration

plans for before and during this convention, and is currently

incarcerated.

Chicago assures the Bureau that full and continuing

attention is devoted to this aspect of our operation, its

potential

value is well appreciated and this office will remain

alert and receptive to any opportunity to accomplish and

establish a productive counterintelligence operation.

Re Bureau airtel 3/4/68; and Chicago letter

7/2/68.

Set forth below is the periodic progress letter

requiredd concerning captioned matter, as requested in

referenced Bureau airtel under captiorsas instructed.

1. Operations Under Consideration

Subsequent to the above referenced Chicago

comnunication,

this office has had several counterintelligence

operations under consideration. A review of the income

tax returns of HERBERT MOHAMED, one of the heads of the

Nation of Islam (NOI), has been completed, HERBERT MOHAMMED

having been earlier designated by Chicago

as a primary

counterintelligence target.

It was determined, however,

through this review that this individual appears to have

submitted accurate income tax returns for the past several

years and the anticipated counterintelligence approach on

this basis was judged to be inappropriate.

Several additional counterintelligence approaches

to the NOI have subsequently be considered, in reference to

NOI units in San Antonio and Phoenix; however,

for reasons

set forth in Chicago communications of October 4, 1968 and

October 16, 1968, under the above caption, such activities

as considered were deemed to be inadvisable.

In relation to the NOI specifically, Chicago

continually monitors closely the activities of this

group with the end in view of developing effective

counterintelligence techniques directed at either the organization

or its leadership. In the event an opportunity : arises where

a productive counterintelligence measure appears in

order, Chicago will immediately submit specifics of such

approach for the Bureau's approval.

Reference has been made in the above referred to .

Chicago communication

to the state and local Gun Ownership

and Registration Ordinanceswhich appear to render such

possession or ownership on the part of black nationalists

a vulnerable area in the event information exists thai they

are in possession of firearms illegally.

Chicago is in

the process of initiating a file review

concerning such

selected cases,

the results of this review to be utilized

in a close check of the records of both sate and local law

took

enforcement and regulatory agencies.

The records of these

agencies have only just recently been determined as having been

placed in order for an effective review along these lines to

be made.

Many of these militants are known in the past to have

been in possession of weapons and where information can be

developed reflecting that they are curzently in possession

of firearms, or are suspected of being in possession of fire-

arms, appropriate liaison will be exploited to utilize tbese

statutes to the extent possible against the militants in

question.

Such a program will be submitted to the

Bureau for approval, prior to any specific such action being

taken by Chicago,

Chicago continues to closely jollow the activities

Of ROSERT BROWN, referred to in referenced letter of

July 2, 1968, as a primary counterintelligence target. he

was recently

turned down for military service and

consequently will continue to be active locally. He is the

former head of the Chicago and Midwest group of the student

Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and most recently

has indicated his conversion to or formation of a local

branch of the Black Panther Party, headquartered in Oakland,

This is a very recent development and the extent

of the organization of this group in terms of membership and

possible influence locally is as yet difficult to establish.

This situation was referred to at some length in, a Chicago

communication under the above caption, octoberls,

1958, and

the situation is relatively unchanged

from that time.

In addition, however, a Chicago racial source

close to BROWN has advised that he has recently expressed a

desire to "take over" the remains of the Chicago Chapter of

the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), this group having

been expelled from National CORE in early October, 1968.

This expulsion came about as a result of a September, 1968,

walkout on the part of the Chicago Chapter from the National

CORE Convention held in St. Louis, Missouri.

BROWN and the head of the local CORE group, ROBERT

LUCAS, have never been friendly and BROWN had stated his desire

to remove LUCAS from the leadership of this group and place it

under the Black Panther Party banner, meaning by this under his

own leadership. To complicate this situation somewhat; however,

this former CORE group,

under the leadership of LUCAS, has only

recently organized itself into a new black organization calling

itself Black Liberation Alliance, formed at the national

meeting held over the weekend of

October 18-20, 1968, at

Columbus, Ohio.

BROWN did not attend this aïfair and the position

he will take as a result of this development is not yet clear.

It is belleved, however, that this. situation,

- 3-

---

## Page 298

CG 157-2209

due in large measures to the friction among personalities

involved, offers some opportunity for exploitation under a

counterintelligence approach. At present, the situation

appears to be too rormative and nebulous for a specific

technique to be intelligently developed.

In short regarding the above situation, within

a period of little more than a month, the Chicago CORE

Chapter, together with a rather limited number of adherents in

other cities, has moved from a CORE group in good standing

to a new and

somewhat organized black group. It would appear

that the early stages of the development of this group

would offer a good opportunity to inhibit its effectiveness

and as soon as Chicago can analyze the situation and

develop what appears an effective approach,

a specific

recommendation for a counterintelligence action will be

submitted for Bureau approval.

JANES HARVEY, a male Negro, age

24, the founder

and organizer of the Afro-American Students Association was

also reierred to in referenced Chicago letter as a likely

counterintelligence target. An analysis of his most recent

activities would reflect that he is at present in a position

where he might well be vulnerable to a well thought out

counterintelligence approach.

He has, until very recently,

engaged

in no significant local militant activities;

however, within the past month has emerged as a principal

"adult advisor" to several individuals and black youth

groups instrumental in the organization and implementation of

black student boycotts and unrest generally within the Chicago

Public School System. HARVEY operates principally

out of

the Umoja (unity) Black Students Center on Cnicago's south

side and appears to have been a substantial influence on this

movement which has been of significant success in terms of its

effect on schools in Chicago's ghetto community. In

consideration of counterintelligence approaches to HARVEY,

= 4

## Page 299

CG 157-2209

-attention will be devoted to his travel to Czechoslovakia

during 1968, as well as his sunmer of 1968 travel to Japan

where he reportedly was in contact with communist orientated

student and youth groups.

During 1968 it was also determined

that HARVEY in the past has advised his local drait board of

homosexual activities on his part,

which activities have

served as the basis for his exclusion from military service.

It appears possible that the above as well as additional

past activities on his part might well be utilized in

possibly compromising him and to some extent the black school

boycott movement with which he is to some extent involved.

Again, prior to the inception of any counterintelligence

activities, Chicago will submit a specific recommendation to

the Bureau

for its approval.

2. Operations Being Effected

No counterintelligence operations are currently

in progress in this field in Chicago; however, as the

information

set forth previously would reflect, Chicago

anticipates that very shortly recommendationto initiate such

* -5

operations will be forthcoming.

3. Tangible Results

No tangible results have as yet been forthcoming

since the inception of this program in the black nationalist

field.

1. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

Information reflecting on this captioned subject

matter has been referred to in large measure under the first

item above. In short, however, the most significant

developments locally would appear to be represented

in the

expulsion of Chicago CORE from the national group with the

development of a new black nationalist organization involving

these former members of CORE; development of a local Chapter of the Blac

Panther Party and a possible rivalry between this group and

the leader of the new black organization referred to previously;

-5.

CG 157-2209

the emergence of the high school age black student groups

at the present as the most violent and possibly militant

black groups active locally. Attempts to develop an effective

counterintelligence approach locally are consequently being

directed at thése areas of development.

The Chicago black nationalist scene generally

continues to be a fragmented one, characterized by a number

of small and relatively ineffective groups and individuals,

none of whom have indicated a willingness or ability to

work together or to polarize these to some extent competitive

groups into a united front-type organization or grouping. Chicago

feels that through an effective and well thought out counter-

Intelligence approach, it may be possible to develop programs

which will in some measure contribute to the

continuation of this situation

and prevent the emergence

locally of a group or individual who may serve as a unifying

force within the black nationalist grouping.

chicago will

remain continually alert to explore and exploit every avenue

for possible counterintelligence activities directed at the

black nationalist field which appears to hold potential for

+ ns

accomplishing

; this end. Any such development or technique

will be immediately made available to the Bureau for its

consideration and approval prior to inception by Chicago.

On a continuing basis Chicago is in the process of

analyzing and considering the constantly changing local

Black Nationalist situation from the viewpoint of the

development of an effective counterintelligence program.

At the present time emphasis is being placed upon the develop-

ing Black Panther Party (BPP) group which has only recently

opened offices on Chicago's west side and which is now actively

recruiting and establishing itself as a functional organization.

locally.

This situation remains somewhat fluid and as yet

no specific counterintelligence program has been developed

for this reason.

As an example, in the initial stages here of the

establishment of the BPP group there was conflict between

rival factions, one recognized by the parent organization in

Oakland, California, the other unsanctioned. The rivalry

between such militantly orientated persons briefly threatened

to erupt into physical controntation on several occasions,

on the BPP, anticipates the submission of such communication

on or prior to December 16, 1968.

By letter November 22, 1968, Chicago submitted specific

counter intelligence recommendations

concerning JAMES HARVEY,

local Black Nationalist personality, who has most recently

been an influential advisor to young black students in Chicago

who have been involved in student boycotts on the high school

level.

No response as yet has been forthcoming and Chicago

will take no action regarding the recommendations submitted

without prior Bureau approval. Chicago is continuing to attempt

to isolate instances regarding local Black Nationalists who

have been in possession of firearms in the past and who appear

to possibly be in violation of local and state firearms

provisions. It is anticipated that such a review will be

completed shortly and where appropriate, communication will

be submitted to the Bureau with specific recommendations

contained therein.

It appears in some instances. however, that

action in this regard may be taken locally which

is not purely

counter intelligence in nature.

An example of such was the recent instance where in

connection with a review of background information concerning

JEFF FORT, local leader of the Blackstone Rangers, south side

Chicago Negro gang it was determined that a warrant was out-

standing for FORT for failure to pay a fine of $50,00 on a

disorderly conduct conviction. In conversation with the

personnel of the Chicago Police Department, Gang Intelligence

it is inform want to a dia ee cute testence,

a search could then be made of the premises and contraband

such as firearms or narcotics might possibly be located.

This was in fact done, as set forth in Chicago airtel

and letterhead memorandum of December 9, 1968, under the

caption JEFF FORT, Contempt of Congress,

Miscellaneous -

Information Concerning.

When the arrest warrant was served on

FORT a search was made

by Police Department representatives

of the premises at his residence and a .22 caliber four shot

derringer pistol was located.

As a result FORT was subsequently

charged with having an unregistered weapon in his possession

as well as Unlawful Use of a Weapon. He is scheduled to appear

in court on December 18, 1968, to answer to these charges.

It might also be noted in passing that Chicago continues to

maintain periodic contact with Federal District Court Judge

JAMES PARSONS approved by the Bureau for counterintelligence

usage sometime ago, but primarily against the NOI. These

contacts have been

amplified recently by virtue primarily of

changing times and events to embrace the Black Nationalist

field generally.

The contacts with PARSONS, informal in nature,

are considered to have been directly responsible for recent

statements by him, widely reported in the Chicago press

"glib exploiters of disenfranchised people."

It is felt PARSONS will certainly continue to speak

out in such fashion and the contact by Chicago productive

of such will continue.

In referenced Chicago letter reference was made to

possibLe traction between RUbEsT BRoIN, above, and RobErt

• LUCAS,

the latter the National head of

the newly formed Black

Liberation Alliance (BLA). Since referenced letter no significant

developments have taken place in this regard and no further

information has been developed reflecting any interest on the

part of BROWN in this group.

The BLA holds regular meetings,

however, to date less than 10 individuals have actually joined

the organization, its activities limited almost exclusively to

these meetings and to such activities as literature distribution.

At the present time BLA appears to be floundering and to have

no real or apparent support within the

Black Nationalists in particular. It is felt a counterintelligence

interest at this time in the BLA is not warranted.

2) Operations Being Effected

Reference has previously been made to the periodic

contact with Judge PARSONS to this end.

noted that Chicago is awaiting Bureau authority to implement

a counterintelligence program against JAMES HARVEY. Recom-

mendations regarding HARVEY were submitted on November 22, 1968.

Chicago also will continue to selectively advise

local authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists

appear vulnerable to arrest on local charges, in instances

where such information is either not available or apparent

to them.

This is in reference to such instances as that set

forth previously involving JEFF FORT.

3) Tangible Results

In this regard, the remarks of Judge PARSONS, alluded

to previously and the arrest of FORT both appear as tangible

results of Chicago counterintelligence activity.

4) Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

The principal development locally, subsequent to

referenced letter, would appear to be the emergence of the

BPP Chapter referred to previously under the leadership of

ROBERT BROWN

and his associates.

The question of the ability

of this group to provide a unifying and polarizing influence

within the local Black Nationalist community remains to be

seen.

Chicago will very closely follow the development and

activities of this group, through knowledgeable BPP sources,

and will submit counterintelligence suggestions in the bi-monthly

letter requested by the Bureau as instructed.

and reported on their recent annual convention, and was

the object of an attempt by an official of the

NOI to

force upon him $1000 as a token of NOI appreciation of

articles relative to the organization.

The purpose of

our previous contacts with JONES in this connection was

to provide him with background information relative to

the non-religious aspects of the NOI, its business

ventures and financial dealings.

At the NOI convention, and subsequent thereto,

NOI officials have made statements critical of NALCOLM X,

describing him as an

example, as one of "the worst enemies"

of the Muslims, meaning by inference black people. A

story regarding

these attacks on MALCOLM at the convention

was authored by JONES, and subsequently appeared in the

"Tribune".

A highly placed Chicago source in the NOI,

namely CG 6896-S, has since advised that the NOI attacks

on MALCOLM have generally produced unfavorable results

within the Negro community on the south side, particul rly

since the NOI in many quarters is still regardedas responsible

for the death of MALCOLM.

Accordingly,

chuage tall shortly submit, by

separate communication, Burean authority to recontact

JONES relative to possibilities of further exploiting

the- NOI attacks on MALCOLM, directed at further reflecting

unfavorable reaction toward the NOI.."

At present Chicago has no further specific

counterintelligence proposals under consideration. Another

letter regarding the BPP, however, is due for submission

March 24, 1969.

2. Operations Being Effected and

Tangible Results Obtained

Reference has previously been made to the

specific counterintelligence actions initiated by

Chicago. As yet no information has been received by

Chicago reflecting tangible results of these actions.

CG 157-2209

A detailed analysis of the use of WILLIAM

JONES was set forth in Chicago airtel of February 17,

1969.. In short, it was noted that the NOI was shown

publicly as more of a business than a religious group,

and articles authored by him may have had the effect of

rendering NoI officials vulnerable to robbery efforts,

as in the case of RAYMOND SHARRIEF, Supreme Captain,

Fruit of Islam, February 4, 1969.

• JONES is being considered.

Chicago has also continued to advise local

authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists,

particularly BPP members, appear vulnerable to arrest

on local charges. Along

these lines Chicago letter of

February 10, 1969, set forth specific information whereby

FRED HAMPTON, loCal BPP officer, was arrested just prior

to a television appearance, through efforts of

a Chicago

BPP source and Chicago Special Agents.

The arrest was an

effective source of embarrassment to the BPP: however.

' HAMPTON was subsequently found innocent, in jury trial,

of the mob action charges for which he had been arrested.

Additionally, information has regularly been

disseminated by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local

dissemination in instançes where Chicago BPP subjects have

travelled elsewhere. Specifically local BPP subjects have

on several occasions journeyed to the. University of

Illinois, Champaign, Illinois, and their activities there

have resulted in numerous arrests.

Prior knowledge of

the presence of these subjects, their purposes and

identities, have been of great

value in alerting local

authorities to the potential for violence represented.

One of those

• local BPP members arrested in

Springfield was determined to be on probation on local

Chicago charges. Inasmuch as the arrest represented a

violation of this probation, the information regarding

the arrest was made available to the appropriate Chicago

Police authorities, and probation authorities. Unfortunately,

lack of interest in taking any action

in this matter.

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

'As in the recent past, the most significant

area of development continues to center around the

activities of the local BPP. It has suffered from

organizational and factional problems, as well as

financial difficulties, and has yet to prove its ability

to serve as a cohesive or unifying influence in the

local Black Nationalist community.

As concerns the remainder of local Black

for the sake of a united front.

It might be noted at this point that Chicago

continues

to regard the local BPP as the focal point for

counterintelligence in this field. The letter of June 17,

1969, requests Bureau authority to attempt to publicize

cartoon depictions of the BPP in a subservient position

to the sDs.

Within recent weeks a relatively small, but highly

vocal group of young Puerto Ricans has emerged in the

Spanish speaking community, utilizing the name Young Lords.

Essentially a youth or street gang in nature, it has adopted

the pose of a political

organization, and an affiliation

with the BPP has arisen.

It appears

that the real nature

this group, and those associated with it, are not generally

recognized by

the responsible elements in the community,

and the Ille of this group, and of those persons in and

associated with it,

are being reviewed with the end

developing a

suitable counterintelligence program. A

recommendation will be provided the Bureau in the event an

effective action can be formulated.

2. & 3. Operations being Effected and Tangible Results

Obtained

Chicago at present has in effect the program

authorized by the Bureau May 21, 1969, to instruct selected

BPP informants for use in creating a rift. between the

BPP and SDS. It is as yet to early to determine what, if

any, effect will be forthcoming..

This program additionally

has become somewhat complicated by the disruption which has

been created in the BPP locally by the June 4, 1969, raid of

the Chiago Office on the BPP headquarters, and subsequent

Chicago Police Department arrests of some

sixteen BPP members,

on a variety of local charges.

in light of the Bureau's observations in letter of May

This program is being pursued very carefully' 21,

Tangible results subseguently obtained will be provided

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

The emergence of the Young Lords has been

previously referied to.

Also of interest is the

disruption of the regular and normal functioning

of the BPP, througn effective and vigorous enforce

ment of criminal statutes violated by them on a local

and federal level.

Most recent information from BPP

sources reflects the organization to be purging its

ranks, in an effort to weed out infiltrators; also

reflects that there may be beginning to emerge in lower

levels of BPP ranks a dissatisfaction with the current

reflecte that th

leadership.

This situation will be followed closely

and where a counterintelligence avenue appears to offer

itself, a suitable recommendation will be forthcoming.

No counterintelligence action will be taken

by Chicago without Bureau approval.

In recent weeks a highly vocal group of young

Puerto Ricans calling themselves the Young Lords have

undertaken action in the north side Puerto Rican neighborhood.

This group is basically a youth gang, however, they have

become

active in neighborhood matters particularly urban renewal

problems for the area. Information available concerning the

Young Lords and its leader's is being reviewed with the end

in mind of the possibility of developing a suitable counter-

intelligence program concerning this group. When and if a

suitable recommendation is developed, such will be provided

to the Bureau in the event an effective action can be

formulated.

2 and 3. OPERATIONS BEING EFFECTED AND TANGIBLE

RESULTS OBTAINED

Chicago at present has in effect the program

authorized by the Bureau July 31, 1969, to mail copies

of cartoons prepared to further efforts to create a rift

i student to 2 0%

between the BPP and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) •

It is, as yet, too early to determine what, if any, effect

will be forthcoming.

This program is being pursued very carefully, in

light of the Bureau's observations in letter of July 31, 1969.

Any tangible results subsequently obtained will be provided

the Bureau.

4. DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INTEREST

The recent statement of DAVID HILLIARD, BPP, Chief

of staiI,

that the BPP will take action against SDS if they

make "one more counter-revolutionary statement" would appear

to indicate a widening of a rift between the BPP and SDS.

This situation will be followed closely and where a

counterintelligence

effort would appear to have reasonably

tangible potential, a suitable recommendation will be

submitted.

No counterintelligence action will be taken by

authorities of instances where BPP members appear

vulnerable to arrest on local charges.

In this regard,

Chicago letter to the Bureau dated November 21, 1969,

captioned "Black Panther Party (BPP), RM" is concerned

with the location in Chicago of weapons reportedly

purchased legally by local BPP members. This infor-

mation has been furnished

to local law

enforcement

officials.

Officials of the Chicago Police Department

have advised that the department is currently planning

a positive course of action relative to this information.

Information has regularly been disseminated

in instances where Chicago BPP have travelled elsewhere.

Local BPP members have made a number of trips to

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN

(Democratic Convention 1968)

captioned "Re:

following:

The Sullivan memorandum to John Dean under Part 4

Democratic Convention 1968"' contained the

"John Criswell, National Treasurer, Democratic

Party called the FBI and said he had dinner

with Marvin Watson, Postmaster General and

Watson had told him of the great services

performed by the FBI during

the last

Democratic Convention in Atlantic, City,

New Jersey. He asked if the same services

could be performed at the Democratic

Convention in Chicago. Some assistance

was given by the Chicago FBl Office but it

was

not at all of the nature and scope of

the services rendered Johnson at Atlantic City."

The files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1968, from C. D. De Loach

to Mr. Tolson captioned "Democratic National Convention,

Chicago, Illinois." A carbon copy of this memorandum was

designated for Mr. Sullivan.

This memorandum states:

#John siswell, NationalStreasurer, *

Democratic Party, called this afternoon to

indicate that he

had had dinner with Marvin

Watson, the Postmaster General, last night,

and Hatson had informed him of the great

service performed by the FBI during the

services could be performed this time

in Chicago. He also asked if I could

personally go out and take charge, as

was the case in Atlantic City.

I told Criswell that Bill Connell,

Executive Assistant to the Vice President,

had already called regarding this matter,

and had personally discussed the entire

matter with the Director. I stated the

Director had made complete arrangements

to have a topflight group of experienced

agents, under the supervision of the

Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago

Office, handle this assignment. I told

Criswell I felt certain these men would

do an excellent job and the Vice President's

office would be kept fully advised at all

times of need-to-know information.

Criswell expressed appreciation

and stated he did not know Connell had

already made the request in question."

Sullivan Memoranda to John Dean

According to this memorandum, Mr. Connell told

Mr. De Loach that the President had, some time ago, advised

the Vice President that the FBI had sent a "special team"

to Atlantic City during the last Democratic National

Convention.

The President allegedly told the Vice President

that the FBI had been of great service to him and he had

been given considerable information on a timely basis

throughout the entire convention.

Mr. Connell stated, according to the memorandum,

that while he desired to discuss this with the Director,

the Vice President hoped the Director would. extend to him

the same service during the forthcoming Democratic National

Convention in Chicago.

The memorandum further states that Mr. Connell

was told that, while he desired to discuss this matter

with the Director, he should know that our Chicago Office

is very well prepared to gather intelligence and pass such

intelligence onto appropriate authorities during the

convention. Mr. Connell stated he presumed this to be

true; however, he would call again next week and mention

this matter to the Director.

A handwritten notation by

Mr. Hoover at the end of this memorandum stated "I talked

A memorandum prepared by Mr. Hoover for Mr. Tolson,

Mr. De Loach, Mr. Bishop, and Mr. Sullivan dated August 15,

1968, reflects that at 10:09 a.m. Mr. Hoover talked to

Mr. William Connell, Executive

Assistant to the Vice President.

Mr. Hoover set forth the following information regarding

this conversation:

"Mr. William Connell, Executive

Assistant to the Vice President, returned

my call. I told him I was out of town

when he called last week and I wanted

to return his call.

Mr. Connell thanked me for

calling and stated what he had called

about was that he had talked to the

Vice President about the team I sent

into the convention area in 1964 that

was so helpful.

He stated he was hoping

perhaps I might be able to do the same

thing for the Vice President out in

Chicago and have my men directly in

contact with him (Connell):

I advised Mr. Connell that

I had already initiated that and that

he will be supplied by Special Agent

in Charge Marlin Johnson in Chidago;

that any kind offiassistance he wants

to just let Mr. Johnson know and he

will take care of it.

Mr. Connell thanked me and

said he will tell the Vice President."

This memorandum also reflects that at 10:13 a.m.

Mr. Hoover talked to SAC Marlin Johnson in Chicago. Mr. Hoover

likewise set forth the results of this conversation:

" "I called SAC Marlin Johnson in

Chicago and told him I had just talked to

Mr. William Connell, Executive Assistant

to the Vice President, and what he wanted

to have done was an operation similar to

what we did down at Atlantic City at the

last Democratic Convention when lix. Johnson

was running for renomination. I explained

that he would like to have us furnish the

same type of information and be in contact

with him, Connell, on any so-called

intelligence we might get. I stated I

told Mr. Connell we would do that and

that SAC Johnson would be in contact with

Connell and anything he wanted to let

Johnson know.

I told Mr. Johnson we are

not going to get into anything political

but anything of extreme action or violence

contemplated we want to let Connell know.

set it up. I told Mir. Johnson that Connell

is presently in New York. Mr. Johnson said

'he would probably be out in Chicago early

next week."

Illinois, on August 26, 1968, offered the most potential

platform for disruptive activities by racial and Viet Nam

dissident groups, similar instructions were set forth for

both the Miami Office in connection with the Republican

National Convention (August 5-10, 1968) and for the

Chicago Office in connection with the Democratic National

Convention (convening August 26, 1968).

These instructions stated that we had the

responsibility to keep high government officials and

other interested agencies advised of developments in

regard to disruptive activities and that it would be

necessary for each field division of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation to be acutely and continually aware of

developing situations. All offices were instructed

to take the necessary steps to insure that we were

receiving all information available concerning plans

being made to carry on protest demonstrations at the

conventions or to otherwise carry on any disruptive

activities.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation took the

initiative in planning for possible disruptions and

violence during the two national conventions. In addition

*to ourresponsibility tovinistsinfompacion to lotal 00

law enforcement agencies and Secret Service, we also

had the responsibility to develop violations of Federal

laws within our jurisdiction that might occur during

the conventions. Such laws as the Federal Anti-Riot Laws,

Assaulting a Federal Officer statute, Kidnapping statute,

bombing and gun law violations, Presidential and Congressional

Assassination statute, and Crime Aboard Aircraft violations

all come within the investigative responsibility of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

We closely coordinated our activities regarding

the conventions with Federal and state agencies which

had the responsibility to keep the peace and protect

life and property. We disseminated all pertinent

information developed through on-the-scene observations,

pertinent investigation, and through informant coverage

to the appropriate agencies having an interest in the

conventions.

No technical surveillances were utilized in

connection with the Republican Convention in Miami Beach

in 1968 or the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968.

In connection with the Chicago Convention

because of the advanced information developed that

disruptive activities were to occur, we requested

Attorney General authority for the installation of

technical coverage of the Mobilization Office for

Demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention.

This authorization was requested by our memorandum to

Attorney General dated March 11, 1968. By memorandun

March 12, 1968, Attorney General Ramsey Clark declined

authorization for this requested installation. By

memorandum for the Attorney General dated March 22,

March 24, and June 7, 1968, we renewed our previous

request; however, we received no reply. The net result

was that we did not have technical coverage in connéction

with either the Democratic or Republican Conventions

in 1968.

In his March 12, 1968, memorandum declining

authority for a telephonic surveillance in connection

with the anticipated demonstrations, lix. Clark stated "other

investigative activities should be undertaken to provide

intelligence necessary to the protection of the national

interest."

Although extensive plans were made and instructions

issued from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters

in Washington regarding our coverage of these 1968 conventions,

there were no Federal Bureau of Investigation officials on

the scene at either the Republican or Democratic Convention.

In connection with the 1972 Republican and Democratic

National Conventions held in Miami Beach, Florida, similar

coverage was instituted and carried out by the Miami Office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There, likewise, was

no technical coverage utilized in connection with either the

Republican or Democratic National Conventions in Miami Beach

in 1972.

No Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters

officials were on the scene at either of these Conventions.
