On November 7, 1968, Smith called DeLoach and stated
that President Johnson wanted the FBI to abandon its physical
surveillance of Mrs. Chennaultfas well as the physical —
surveillance on the South Vietnam Embassy. However, according
to Smith, President Johnson desired that we keep the telephone
surveillance on the South Vietnam Embassy in operation. Smith
additionally mentioned that President Johnson was of the
opinion that the intelligence obtained by the FBI in this
operation was of the highest order] He stated that the facts wv
furnished by the FBI had been exactly what had been needed
by The White House and that he and the President were very
grateful.

; On November 12, 1968, at the instruction of

President Johnson, outgoing telephone calls made by then
Vice-P?residential candidate Spiro Agnew on November 2, 1968, .
at which time he was in Albuquerave, New Mexico, were

checked (through toll records) by the Albuquerque Office of

the FBI. The purpose was to determine if Agnew had made

toll calls from Albuquerque (to the South Vietnam Embassy or] Sw
to Mrs. Chennault (no such records were located by Albuaueraue).
This information was furnished to President Johnson on

November 13, 1968. Also, the arrival and departure times of
Agnew in and out of Albuquerque, New Mexico, on November 2,
1968, were verified at the request of The White House.

- On January 6, 1969, instructions were received from
The White House to discontinue televhone surveillances on

at during the veriod of the Presidential election in 1968,

e National Security Agency (NSA) had intercepted a cable
from the South Vietnamese Embassy to Saigon which indicated
that Chennault had been in contact with the South Vietnamese
Ambassador in an effort to persuade him to keev the
South Vietnamese Government from attending the Paris peace
negotiations until after the election since it would not
devolve to the credit of the Republican Party. (S)

In this regard, DeLoach alleged that President Johnson
talked to him prior to his death regarding this matter
and that President Johnson told him that if President Johnson
started to get pressured concerning the Chennavlt matter,
that President Johnson still had a copy of the cable,
presumably in the Johnson library, with which President Johnson
could prove the Republicans had tried to sabotage the veace
negotiations and that President Johnson would teveal the
eontents of this cable.

could be identified with the cable referred to above by
DeLoach. {FBI files do indicate that on September 12, 1967,

. NSA requested coverage on the teletype facilities of the
South Vietnamese Embassy, Washington, D. C., which was
authorized by the AG on January +, 1968, and installed on
January 25, 1968. FBI files further indicate that at the
request of NSA, the FBI installed coverage on a teletype

From a review of FBI files, it would appear that
the reason The White House was interested in the activities
of the South Vietnam Embassy, Mrs. Chennault, and Spiro Agnew,
was to determine whether the South Vietnamese had secretly
been in touch with supporters of Presidential candidate
Nixon, possibly through Mrs. Chennault, as President Johnson
was apparently suspicious that the South Vietnamese were
trying to sabotage his peace negotiations in the hope that
Nixon would win the election and then take a harder line
towards North Vietnam. In this regard, it is noted that on
one occasion, Smith advised DeLoach that President Johnson
was undecided as to whether Mrs. Chennault was working for
certain factions within the United States (possibly for the
Republican Party) or whether she was actually working for
North Vietnam.(S)

Reference is made to my letter of January 30, 1975, setting
forth information in the "Sullivan memoranda." Your attention is invited
to specifically Item 8 of this letter. This item is made up of two paragraphs.
The first paragraph statés that President Johnson asked the FBI to look
into members of Senator Goldwater's staff and give him the results. A review
. was made and results furnished some of which contains derogatory information.

We have located a work copy of a memorandum to Mr. DeLoach dated
October 26, 1964, captioned "NAME CHECK REQUEST FOR WHITE HOUSE."
This copy states that Bill Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, requested
a special check of the Bureau's files concerning persons employed in Senator

i Goldwater's Office. Using the United States Senate telephone directory, 15

' individuals were listed"and a memorandum was attached reflecting the results
of the check. The recommendation wag that Mr. DeLoach furnish the memo-
randum to Mr. Moyers. ‘

: We are unable to locate a record copy of the above-described
‘memoranda, .

A record copy of a letter to Mr. Moyers dated October 27,
| "1964, is in file and was hand delivered by Mr. DeLoach on October 28, 1964 4,

Jenkins well; that Jenkins had traveled with Goldwater; that Jenkins was
familiar with Goldwater activities.

1964, to Mr. Hoover from Assistant Director Cartha D. DeLoach. This
memorandum sets forth a conversation with President Johnson on October 19,
1964, on several matters including a great deal of discussion on the
"Walter Jenkins Affair." Portions of this memorandum contain the following
language, "The President stated Jenkins was cleared by Barry Goldwater's
squadron in 1958. . . the President stated that Goldwater would find it

ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY DURING
WORLD WAR I

The folloWing is submitted for your information:

An article starting on page Al of the February 7, 1975,

issue of the Washington Star-News stated Charles W. Colson, former

White House Aide, appeared on NBC's "Today" program on February 7,

1975. He stated while he was a White House Aide the FBI furnished

Navy during World War Il. Colson stated it concerned information picked

up while the FBI was investigating a female Nazi agent. 'Lieutenant
- Kennedy was being followed by FBI Agents."' Colson characterized the data as
"personal gossip."

A review of our files discloses the matter referred to by
Colson appareltly concerns the investigation of Mrs. Paul Fejos, nee
Inga Arvad, who was the subject of an Internal Security and Espionage -
German investigation conducted in the early 1940's. Mrs. Fejos first
came to our attention in November, 1940, upon receipt of a letter from
a fellow student from Columbia University School of Journalism, New York
City, which stated Fejos may well have been sent to the United States by
Germany to influence morale. A New York City Offite report dated June 1,
194i, disclosed’she hadSteen ffi@hdly With Adolf Hitler and Herman Goering
inthe 1930's. Mrs. Fejos appeared at our Washington Field Division on :

WILLIAM R, ANDERSON
FORMER UNITED STATES
CONGRESSMAN *
(DEMOCRAT - TENNESSEE)

An article in the January 19, 1975, issue of the Washington Post
written by Ronald Kessler stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation in-
vestigated former Congressman William R. Anderson of Tennessee after he
made remarks critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This article
states in part:

, . , an informed source said Hoover had ordered derogatory material
gathered on Rep, Anderson, who was defeated in 1972 after serving four
terms. The order was given after Anderson criticized Hoover for naming
Daniel and Philip Berrigan as having plotied to kidnap a high government
official. . . In complying with Hoover's order, agents in Nashville office
of the FBI first provided relatively inocuous information about Anderson,
the source said. But Hoover ordered them to try again, the source said,
and this time they reported that the madam of a house of prostitution had
said she thought Anderson had visited her place of business several years
earlier, The purported identification was made from a photo the agents
showed of Anderson, he added." +

Bureau and on the Director himself. y

He recalled that shortly after the publicity an Agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in Nashville, Tennessee, received a call from an old-
time "madam" who had furnished the Agent with information for many years
concerning prostitution. She volunteered to the Agent that she was irritated
by comments made by Anderson and said that she had supplied Anderson with
prostitutes for the past six or seven years at various motels in the Nashville
metropolitan area.

‘ He said this information was volunteered and unsolicited and no in-
vestigation was conducted. The information was furnished in a personal letier
to Mr. Hoover by the then Special’ Agent in Charge of the Memphis Office
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Former Agents in the Nashville, Tennessee, area during the pertinent
period were recently contacted. They have advised that they never investigated
Anderson and had never shown Anderson's photograph,

The Washington Post news article quoted earlier mentioned that the
identification of Anderson was made from a photograph shown by Agents. A
review of the files of the Memphis Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
disclosed only one picture of Anderson and it appeared in an article in the
Nashville Banner on January 21, 1975. There was no photograph of Anderson
in the files which might have been shown by Agents at an earlier date.

There was no evidence in the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
showing that former Director Hoover ", . . ordered derogatory material
gathered on Rep, Anderson.’! There is no photograph of Anderson in the
files of our Memphis Office as noted above. There is no evidence that a
photograph of Anderson was shown by Agents and no evidence that an in-
vestigation of Anderson was conducted in relation to his association with
prostitutes. : ua

"Re: Walter W. Jenkins

"President Johnson called the FBI on October 27, 1964
to give instructions that Andy Choka (involved with
Jenkins) be pinned down more fully. President Johnson
said he had noted the FBI had not asked Choka if he had
known Grenier (phonetic) or Burch of the Republican
Party. President Johnson said FBI must ask : »
Choka this question. President Johnson also said that
the FBI should bring pressure to bear on the Park
Policeman who had lied about Jenkins attempting to
solicit him in LaFayette Park on the night of October 7,
1964. The FBI in keeping with Johnson's wishes had
already asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart Udall
Secretary of the Department of Interior to bring
pressure on the Park Policeman with no results.
President Johnson next discussed in some length on
the ‘unfortunate publicity’ about the flowers which
‘Mr. Hoover had sent to Mr‘ Jenkins. Instructions were

A review of Bureau files has determined the existence of a

Pertinent portions of the memorandum follow:

"The President called me at approximately 2:10 p.m. today
while I was at lunch. He stated he had thoroughly read the big report
sent over to him on the Jenkins matter. He stated he thought it was very
complete and that the FBI had done a good job. He mentioned there was
one thing that was bothering him. He then stated that he felt we should
attempt to tie Andy Choka down a little further. He noted that we had
not asked Choka if he had known Grenier (ph.) or Burch of the Republican
Party. The President stated in order to round out this picture more
complete he thought we should contact Choka once again and ask him
these specific questions. ,

a :

"The President asked me if I thought that Choka could have
been part of a frame-up. I told him there was no evidence to this effect,
that Choka had a previous record of sexual offenses and that apparently
he had been in the basement men's room of the YMCA on 10/7/64 with
the hopes of finding a person to commit a homosexual act with.

"The President . . . did think we should attempt to bring
further pressure on the Park Policeman who had lied about Jenkins
attempting to solicit him in LaFayette Park on the night of 10/7/64.

"I told the President I had asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart

“Udall, Secretary of the Department of Interior , to bring pressure on the

Park Policeman (Shoemaker) so that this man would reveal all facts in
his possession. The President stated Udall had already tried to bring
pressure on this man and that such pressure amounted to nothing."

The DeLoach memorandum‘continued that the President discussed
the Director's sending flowers to Jenkins at the time of Jenkins' hospitaliza-
tion. The memorandum stated that the President dwelt at some length on
the Hhessciiakieta publicity" about the flowers. 3

of $25, 000 which he allegedly received. President Johnson reportedly

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach advised that the President
(Johnson) telephonically requested the Department of Justice conduct

Williams stated on September 1, 1964, in the Senate, that a payoff was
alleged to have been made by Don Reynolds. Investigation was immediately

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN
(SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER)

Reference is made to my letter of January 30, 1975, setting
forth information in the "Sullivan memoranda." Your attention is invited
to specifically Item 8 of this letter. This item is made up of two paragraphs.
The first paragraph states that President Johnson asked the FBI to look
into members of Senator Goldwater's staff and give him the results. A review
was made and results furnished some of which contains derogatory information.
We have located a work copy of a memorandum to Mr. DeLoach dated
October 26, 1964, captioned "NAME CHECK REQUEST FOR WHITE HOUSE."
This copy states that Bill Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, requested
a special check of the Bureau's files concerning persons employed in Senator
Goldwater's office. Using the United States Senate telephone directory, 15
individuals were listed and a memorandum was attached reflecting the results
of the check. The recommendation was that Mr. DeLoach furnish the memo-
randum to Mr. Moyers.

We are unable to locate a record copy of the above-described
memoranda, . . :

A record copy of a letter to Mr. Moyers dated October 27,
1964, is in file and was hand delivered by Mr. DeLoach on October 28, 1964.
This letter advised that there was no derogatory information in our files on
13 of the individuals mentioned. However, concerning Edward Kenneth Nellor
who “has been. . . his traveling press secretary, the FBI received information
on October 29, 1956, gihateHdyNellor sx . gatrequently dates prostitutes @he “&
informant stated she had filled at least six dates . . . she also alleged that
on one occasion. . . he became drunk and abusive. She said she had avoided
him since that time.'" Also furnished was an Identification Record for William
Randall Seward who was apparently identical with Senator Goldwater's legisla-
tive assistant. This Identification Record showed a traffic Violation « on”
August 10, 1956, in California.

NW 55154

Item 8 also states that President Johnson on October 20, 1964,
advised that Mr. (Walter) Jenkins had been cleared by Barry Goldwater's
squadron in 1958; that Goldwater would find it difficult to deny he knew
Jenkins well; that Jenkins had traveled with Goldwater; that Jenkins was
familiar with Goldwater activities.

We have been able to locate a memorandum dated October 20,
1964, to Mr. Hoover from Assistant Director Cartha D. DeLoach. This
memorandum sets forth a conversation with President Johnson on October 19,
1964, on several matters including a great deal of discussion on the
"Walter Jenkins Affair." Portions of this memorandum contain the following
language, "The President stated Jenkins was cleared by Barry Goldwater's
squadron in 1958. . . the President stated that Goldwater would find it
difficult to deny that he knew Jenkins quite well personally. He stated that
Jenkins had traveled with Goldwater on several occasions and that Jenkins
was familiar with the fact that Goldwater had had dates with a prostitute in
San Francisco and has spent all night with one of these women."

COMMENTS MADE BY CHARLES W, COLSON
ON THE "TODAY" PROGRAM, FEBRUARY 7,
1975, CONCERNING INFORMATION FURNISHED
BY THE FBI ABOUT GEORGE 8, McGOVERN

Former White House Aide Charles W. Colson appeared on NBC's
"Today" program on February 7, 1975. During this appearance he stated
he was supplied with information from the FBI about "one unfortunate
incident" in the life of George McGovern. He stated that this information
was received in 1971 or 1972,

A review of the files of the FBI concerning George 8, McGovern
reveals information concerning one incident that is contained therein which
may be referred to as "one unfortunate incident." This information deals
with McGovern's fathering an illegitimate child in 1941. Information con-
cerning this incident was acquired and verified during a special inquiry
investigation which was initiated on December 8, 1960, at the request of
Lawrence F. O'Brien, assistant to then President-elect Kennedy.

This information, along with other information which was coilecied
during the course of this investigation, was disseminated to the White House
on December 27, 1960. The files of the FBI reflect that no further dis-
semination of this information was made. The FBI files reflect that on
March 6, 1961, the Secret Service requested a name check concerning
McGovern, At that time Secret Service was advised that an applicant-type
investigation had been conducted during December, 1960, resuits of which

were furnished to the White House and the Secret Servite was referred to
SS PES coats err Sble Rx<enfth O'WSunell, S¥ecial Assistalit to US
President,

The files of the FBI do not reflect any dissemination of information
concerning an illegitimate child of McGovern to anyone outside the FBI
during 1971 or 1972. Of course, the FBI has no information as to what sub-
sequent disposition was made by the White House of the information furnished

to it on December 27, 1960,

COMMENTS MADE BY CHARLES W. COLSON ON THE
"TODAY" PROGRAM, FEBRUARY 7, 1975, CONCERNING
INFORMATION FURNISHED WHITE HOUSE BY THE FBI
ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY DURING
WORLD WAR IE

The following is submitted for your information:

An article starting on page Al of the February 7, 1975,

issue of the Washington Star-News stated Charles W. Colson, former .
White House Aide, appeared on NBC's "Today" program on February 7,

1975. He stated while he was a White House Aide the FBI furnished

extensive information to the White House in 1971 or 1972 concerning
.former President John F. Kennedy while he was with the United States

Navy during World War Il. Colson stated it concerned information picked

up while the FBI was investigating a female Nazi agent. "Lieutenant

Kennedy was being followed by FBI Agents." Colson characterized the data as
"personal gossip."

A review of our files discloses the matter referred to by
“Colson apparently concerns the investigation of Mrs. Paul Fejos, nee
Inga Arvad, who was the subject of an Internal Security and Espionage -
German investigation conducted in the early 1940's. Mrs. Fejos first
ame to our attention in November, 1940, upon receipt of a letter from
fellow student from Columbia University School of Journalism, New York
-£€ity, which stated Fejos may well have been sent to the United States by
Germany to influence morale. A New York City Oftiée report dated June 7,
41941, disclosed she had been friendly with Adolf Hitler and Herman Goering
Pin the 1930's, Mrs. Fejos appeared at our Washington Field Division on .
December 12, 1941, along with representatives of the Washington Times Herald
to volunteer background regarding herself since it had been rumored" she was
eworking for the German Propaganda Ministry. She was a friend of Kathleen
Kennedy, daughter of former Ambassador Joseph Kennedy. She was then writing
s@.column captioned "Did You Happen To See" for the Times Herald which included
wopersonality sketches on persons interviewed by her, She admitted having
EA

interviewed Hitler twice as well as Goebbels and Goering while employed

by a Danish newspaper in the 1930's. She denied she was an intelligence
agent. Her husband was employed by the Swedish financier Axel Wenner-Gren
and had been in Western Pan America in charge of a scientific expedition

for him.

On November 14, 1941, a fellow Times Herald reporter
advised a Bureau official she thought Mrs. Fejos was a 'spy."* On January 17,
1942, a representative of ONI advised it had learned that Joseph Kennedy,
son of former Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, had been "playing around" with
Mrs. Fejos and would probably be transferred out of the Washington, D. C.,
area. A confidential informant of the FBI advised on January 21, 1942, that
"Ensign Jack" of the United States Navy had apparently been spending the night
with Mrs. Fejos.

_ On January 26, 1942, the Attorney General authorized installation
of an electronic surveillance “of Mrs. Fejos. In addition, "F.D.R." sent a
confidential memorandum from the White House dated May 4, 1942, to
Mr. Hoover suggesting Inga Arvad should be "specially watched"! in view of
her connection with the Wenner-Gren expedition's leader (her husband) and
in view of certain other circumstances which had been brought to his attention.

: Physical surveillance conducted by the FBI verified Mrs. Fejos
visited John Kennedy at Charleston, South Carolina, two weekends in February,
1942. During one of these weekends (February 6 - 9, 1942) they stayed in a
room rented in her name at the Fort Sumter Hotel in Charleston. Electronic sur-
veillance coverage disclosed that they engaged in sexual intercourse on a number
of occasions in the hotel room during this period. Kennedy disclosed to Mrs.
Féjos in general terms his tentative official assignment plans and the fact
Presidential Advisor Harry Hopkins had gone to the hospital and was not expected
to ave same. Our subsequent coverage of Mrs. Fejos disclosed additional

periodic contacts between John Kennedy and herself, the latest being in June,
942, ‘She obtained a Reno divorce from Paul Fejos on June 3, 1942, thereafter
using her maiden name Inga Arvad and moved to Ney York Gity August 7, 1942,
after having resigned her Times Herald job in July, “i942. Paul Fejos was .
interviewed by Bureau Agents March 1 and 2, 1945, in New York City and Inga
Avvad' was interviewed February 28, 1945, in Hollywood, California, concerning
the ‘babkéround, activities and associations with Axel Wenner-Gren who was
allégéd to have been pro-German or pro-Nazi. The investigation of Mrs. Fejos
ble ead in 1945 as no- subversive activities had been uncovered.

Bale

DocId:32989639 Page 48



The results of the 1945 interviews were furnished Assistant
‘Attorney General (War Division) Herbert Wechsler by memorandum dated

March 1, 1945, and captioned "Axel Wenner-Gren.' Previously by memorandum
dated February 20, 1942, and captioned "Mrs. Paul Fejos nee Inga Arvad"

Mr. Edward J. Ennis, Director, Alien Enemy Control Unit, Department of

- Justice, was furnished information then known concerning Mrs. Fejos in response

to his request for same dated February 4, 1942. His purpose in requesting
same was to ascertain if a Presidential Warrant of Apprehension should be
issued. Memorandum dated August 13, 1942, also containing background
and activity data concerning Mrs. Fejos was forwarded to Assistant Solicitor
General Oscar Cox on August 15, 1942. No mention of the 1942 association
between Kennedy and Mrs. Fejos is found in the above memoranda.

A complete review of the above file fails to indicate any data
concerning John F. Kennedy's affair with Mrs. Fejos in 1942 was ever
disseminated by the FBI either orally or by memorandum to anyone at anytime,
including the White House in 1971 or 1972 as implied by Mr. Colson.

Based on a review of the above file it is believed extensive
investigation of Mrs. Fejos nee Inga Arvad was certainly indicated by virtue
of the fact several allegations from a number of reliabie and high-placed
sources were received by the Bureau concerning Mrs. Fejos to the effect
she was pro-Nazi, a German spy and was Hitler's publicity agent in Denmark
as well as her association with Nazi German leaders in the 1930's. No active
investigation of John F. Kennedy, as implied by Mr. Colson, was conducted
by the FBI. Kennedy came to our attention only through our active investigation
of Mrs. Fejos.

SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY
AUGUST 22 - 28, 1964

Pursuant to your request concerning captioned matter, the
Washington Post on Sunday, January 26, 1975, carried a front page
story by staff writer Ronald Kessler reporting that during the 1964
Democratic National Convention, President Johnson received reports
on key convention delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by
the FBI on civil rights leaders, and attributed this information toa
Senate Watergate Committee memorandum. The article summarizes
a 1973 interview by the Committee with Leo T. Clark who on his
retirement on February 1, 1965, was the Senior Resident Agent at
Atlantic City. Kessler quotes Clark as saying the information was
reported to President Johnson based on an installation in the hotel
suite of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and a storefront used by civil
rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate Committee
that the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were
carried out by a special FBI team ordered by the White House and was
under the personal direction of Cartha D.. DeLoach, then an Assistant
Director. According to Clark, the stated purpose of the operation was
to gather intelligence on potential violence or disruption and Clark is
reported as stating DeLoach told him to avoid discussing the operation
with the Secret Service.

*

e: @$ The news article corinuest Clark stated mpst of the informa-
tion obtained by the FBI was transmitted to President Johnson over a
telephone line specially installed to bypass the White House switchboard.
According to the news article, Clark said information furnished included
the activities of then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, identities of
Senators and Congressmen visiting King's hotel suite as well as persons
seeking support of civil rights leaders, plans of delegates or delegations

and‘ speculation on Vice Presidential nominees.

Kessler's article states the authenticity of the Clark memo-
randum which cites room numbers of hotel suites bugged and the source
of funds for part of the operation were verified by persons who either
received it or were present when Clark was interviewed. The article
also states the FBI solicited intelligence through Agents posing as
reporters. According to the article, the memorandum indicates Clark
appeared in response to a subpoena but did not testify under oath,

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973
Senate Watergate interview of DeLoach and spelis out DeLoach’s denial
under oath having had a direct line to President Johnson or having
spoken with the President during the convention. Kessier also states
one surveillance was conducted as part of a continuing installation on
a person believed to be under the influence of the Communist Party
which had been approved by Kennedy.

A review of the personnel file of retired SA Clark contains
no information that he was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Com-
comitiee at any time or has been in touch with the Bureau in this regard.

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE "SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate
Watergate Committee, John Dean, on June 27, 1973, testified and identi-
fied certain documents which he previously had furnished to the Committee.
Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony
as the "Sullivan memoranda," apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,
former Assistant to the Director, who retired on October 21, 1971.

These typed documents consisted of five separate items and two enve-
lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building
marked 'tPersonal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first doctment i is headed
"President Johnson, Politics of the FHI. *Thisne-vage ddtument *
concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on November 12,

1968, for the FBI to check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then
Vice Presidential candidate, Mr. Spiro Agnew, on the date of November 2,
1968, when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, This document

states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., November 13, 1968, to
ask about the progress the FBI was making in this matter. (This matter
pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matter.) A-second item concerns
an alleged request by Marvin Watson on February 18, 1966, for the FBI
to cover Senate Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page
indicates President Johnson asked the FBI to determine if Republicans
were involved in instigating a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten page labeled
"Top Secret" and thé heading "Preface" and is a general recitation of
alleged FBI involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far
exceeded Roosevelt in sing the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI,"
is marked "Top Secret,'' and consists of three pages. It cites ten alleged
incidents of misuse of the FBI by President Johnson as follows: (1) Re:
Mrs. Claire Chennault and Embassy. of South Vietnam; @) Re: Democratic
National Convention Atlantic City, 1964; (3) Re: Don Reynolds (@ per-
sonality in the Bobby Baker case); (4) Re: Democratic Convention 1968;

(5) Re: Walter W. Jenkins; (6) Re: Walter Jenkins; (7) Re: Mrs. Claire
Chennault, Embassy of South Vietnam; (8) Re: Senator Barry Goldwater;
(9) Re: George Reedy; (10) Re: Walter Jenkins.

The fourth document reads as follows: "John, Please see the
enclosure the contents of which are self-explanatory. If I am to type
imy observations myself please be tolerant of my poor typing. Bill."

: "The fifth document bears a marking "Secret" re "Watergate .""
This is an offer on the part of Sullivan to testify before the Watergate
Committee in behalf of the Administration and by doing so could put the
current (Nixon) Administration in a very favorable light.

we made several recommendations with regard to the contemplated
testimony by DeLoach. By letter to me dated December 7, 1973,

DeLoach advised that he furnished three hours of testimony to Senator
Howard Bakey.and minority counsel. He advised the testimony was under

the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. DeLoach ze ported
that Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the
advice and instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he
attempted to answer every question with blunt honesty and Department
Regulation 1622 was utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an
electronic surveillance as authorized by former Attorney General Kennedy.

REVIEW OF FBI FILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY
CONCERNING THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on August 20, 1964, a teletype was
directed to all continental offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratic
National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)." This
teletype advises information has been received which indicates subversive
groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodiums and the criminal
element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and the
Bureau must be advised of all such subversive, criminal, hoodlum, and
racial elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period. All
offices were advised the Bureau was not interested in purely political
activity engaged in by delegates and others officially attending the convention.
Other general instructions were set ferth concerning informant availability. A
follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 1964, that any information
of extreme importance or urgency should be submitted immediately by
teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-
munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting
forth pertinent developments. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1964,
Mr, DeLoach set forth a resume of his assignment with a special squad
of FBI personnel at the Democratic National Convention. DeLoach
reported the successful completion of this assignment, He states that
‘by ne ans of informant coverage, use of various confidential techniques,
infiltration. of key groups through use of undercover agents and through &
utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were
able to keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments.
Ye Loach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic
City with Secret Service as well as state and local police.

= This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of
rtin Luther King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage
S5tablished oy the headquarters of the ‘Congress of Racial Equality -
‘Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. DeLoach states he was
able to advise the White House in advance of all plans made by these

two sources and coverage was highly effective. DeLoach advises "with

Bureau approval" he instituted coverage on the Congress of Racial

Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee headquarters at

their meeting hall and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-
quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (two separate

factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a

highlight of the convention) and through cooperation of news media our

Agents were furnished press credentials, DeLoach reported that forty~

four pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter Jenkins at the

White House and to his meno randum he attached a copy of these daily
summaries dated August 24, 25, 26, and 27, 1964. These summaries are

in effect a running log af developments which took place at the convention,
DeLoach also states he arranged for‘a lease line (telephone) between the

control post at Atlantic City and the Bureau. He concludes the memorandum

by making recommendations that personnel involved, namely twenty-seven Agent:
one radio maintenance technician, and two stenographers of the Newark Office

be commended, Mr. Hoover noted DeLoach abe receive a meritorious

award, tee

Concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party referred
to above, Bureau records show that on August 21, 1964, by letter to then
Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach this Bureau responded to a request
dated August 19, 1964, from Mr. John Doar of the Civil Rights Divisio
of the Department requesting a check of Bureau files for any background
information available concerning persons affiliated with the Mississippi

. Freedom Democratic Party delegation. In furnishing the results of the

name checks to Mr. Katzenbach, he was advised “this Bureau has not

conducted any investigation concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
Party nor has it taken any steps to identify party members." Bureau

files also reflect that at the request of Walter Jenkins of the White House

staff we furnished a memorandum dated July 22, 1964, to the White House

setting forth the results of the check of Bureau files-concerning the

alata had ever'seen, According to this meniorandum,

Jenkins told Mr. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and
because of the work some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly
where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were
not able to be very effective. It should be noted that this particular
memorandum of Mr. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents
sent to John Dean.

- Athorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-
randum or other documents pertaining to a request having been received
from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing that the
FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that
at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House
and had a direct line at his resideme to the President so it well may be
that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it
orally with Mr. Hoover or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the
request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL
STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician
who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active
duty with the FBI have confirmed their participation on the squad under
DeLoach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there
was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic
City to fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not
feel that the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,
the instructions to the Agents were to develop advance information regard-
ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances
that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protection for
the President. Two of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover
assignment roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with_
S8bret Se#vice, others were handling the Jarge itumber“of infoftnants™
that we moved ‘into Atlantic City and other Agents were utilized in operating
the technical surveillance on King as well as the microphone installation
installed at the Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee headquarters in Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in charge
and he had with him in Atlantic City three Agents from his office and they
were aware that DeLoach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting
developments, Two Agents recalled DeLoach having a telephone conversa-
tion with Waltér Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at
the time.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE
AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files
contain a memorandum to the Attorney General dated October 7, 1963,
captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., Security Matter - Communist;
Communist Influence in Racial Matters, wherein the Bureau recom-
mended that authority be granted to place a technical surveillance on
King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or at any future address
to which he may move. This memorandum was approved by Attorney
General Kennedy, October 10, 1963. A memorandum dated July 7,
1964, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist
Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the
Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the
facilities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta.
The memorandum observed that the Attorney General had already
authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since
this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by addi-
tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then
Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned
"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman at
Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in
Atlantic City. Bachman had previously received instructions from a
Division official that he explore the possibility of putting technical and
microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-
nical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available at
the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum
pointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with thé microphone
- ginstallation a well as the telephone install&tion. “This memorandum
reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney General to cover
any residences La King may use with a technical installation.
Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary
Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of
Bureau records fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization
for same. A search of microphone authorizations in the Newark Office

likewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installation.
At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone
surveillance was maintained at the Seat of Government and authoriza-
tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Director
who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell dated
May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-
veillances. By memorandum dated September 27, 1965, Attorney
General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use of microphone surveil-
lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that
DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic City
mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committe was based on information that an apparent member of the
Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable activity, much
in a leadership capacity in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Confidential informants reported that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, among the various civil rights organizations, was a principal
target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time our
investigation of the Congress of Racial Equality was limited to deter-
mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organiza-
tion. (While 2 question arises as to the justification of using a microphone
surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted
that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of
Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification
for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of available
material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1964,
concerning the technical surveillance which verifiessthat the work on

- ty phones in-King's rooms at the hoted had kiéen completed; however,

the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view
of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark files also attribute to
then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike
should be considered for the temporary Congress of Racial Hquality
headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City. The only other
information contained in Newark files concerning these installations is
a handwritten log consisting of seventy-eight pages of overhears on
King's telephqnes.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well
as DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad
at the convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification of NBC.
At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves-
tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, instructions were set forth that all
Agent personnel are prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives
of any wire service for the purpose of establishing an investigative
cover. This rule was invoked after a news item appeared in the
Washington Post on June 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had
posed as a representative of the International News Service while covering
an antidraft demonstration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1968. The
allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement
as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the
demonstration.

COVERAGE OF 1964 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
CONVENTION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

Review of Bureau records fails to establish that any specialized
coverage was afforded to the Republican National Convention held in San
Francisco in July, 1964, and the only references in our records relate
to the planning and execution by the Congress of Racial Equality of dem-
onstrations and picketing especially insofar as the nomination of Senator
Barry Goldwater was concerned. Several teletypes and communications
were submitted by San Francisco concerning the demonstrations and
follow-up letterhead memoranda were received by the Bureau and
disseminated.

fied certain documents which he previously had furnished to the Committee,
Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony
as the "Sullivan memoranda," apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,
former Assistant to the Director, who retired on October 21, 1971.
These typed documents consisted of five separate items and two enve-
lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building
marked "Personal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with
the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first doctiment is headed i
"pfeSidéat Johnson, Politics offthe FBI&" Thisone-pese dotument* # 4°:
concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on November 12,
1968, for the FBI to check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then
Vice Presidential candidate, Mr, Spiro Agnew, on the date of November 2,
1968, when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This document

t states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., November 13, 1968, to

7 ask about the progress the FBI was making in this matter. (This matter
ec pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matier.) A second item concerns
an alleged request by Marvin Watson on February 18, 1966, for the FBI
to cover Senate Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page
indicates President Johnson asked the FBI to determine if Republicans
were involved in instigating a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten page labeled
"Top Secret" and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation of
alleged FBI involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far
exceeded Roosevelt in using the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI,"
is marked "Top Secret," and consists of three pages. It cites ten alleged
incidents of misuse of the FBI by President Johnson as follows: (1) Re:
Mrs. Claire Chennault and Embassy of South Vietnam; @) Re: Democratic
National Convention Atlantic City, 1964; (3) Re: Don Reynolds (a per-

REVIEW OF FBI FILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY
CONCERNING THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on August 20, 1964, a teletype was
directed to all continental offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratic
National Convention, Information Concerning (internal Security)." This
teletype advises information has been received which indicates subversive
groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and the criminal
element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and the
Bureau must be advised of all such subversive, criminal, hoodlum, and
racial elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period. All
offices were advised the Bureau was not interested in purely political
activity engaged in by delegates and others officially attending the convention.
Other general instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A
follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 1964, that any information
of extreme importance or urgency should be submitted immediately by
teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-
munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting
forth pertinent developments. Ih a memorandum dated August 29, 1964,
Mr. DeLoach set forth a resume of his assignment with a special squad
of FBI personnel at the Democratic National Convention. DeLoach
reported the successful completion of this assignment, He states that
‘by ne ans of informant coverage, use of various confidential techniques,
infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and threughe a: -
utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were
able to keep the White House fully apprised of all major developmenis,
DeLoach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic
City with Secret Service as well as state and local police,

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of
Martin Luther King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage
established oy the headquarters of the Congress of Racial Equality -
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. DeLoach states he was
able to advise the White House in advance of all plans made by these

two sources and coverage was highly effective. DeLoach advises “with
Bureau approval" he instituted coverage on the Congress of Racial

Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee headquarters at

their meeting hall and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-
quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (two separate

factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a
highlight of the convention) and through cooperation of news media our

Agents were furnished press credentials. DeLoach reported that forty-

four pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter Jenkins at the
White House and to his meny randum he attached a copy of these daily
summaries dated August 24, 25, 26, and 27, 1964. These summaries are
in effect a running log af developments which took place at the convention,
DeLoach also states he arranged for a lease line (telephone) between the
control post at Atlantic City and the Bureau, He concludes the memorandum
by making recommendations that personnel involved, namely twenty-seven Agent:
one radio maintenance technician, and two stenographers of the Newark Office
be commended. Mr. Hoover noted DeLoach should receive a meritorious
award,

Concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party referred
to above, Bureau records show that on August 21, 1964, by letter to then
Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach this Bureau responded to a request
dated August 19, 1964, from Mr. John Doar of the Civil Rights Division
of the Department requesting a check of Bureau files for any background
information available concerning persons affiliated with the Mississippi

. Freedom Democratic Party delegation, In furnishing the results of the
name checks to Mr, Katzenbach, he was advised "this Bureau has not
conducted any investigation concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
Party nor has it taken any steps to identify party members." Bureau
files also reflect that at the request of Walter Jenkins of the White House
staff we furnished a memorandum dated July 22, 1964, to the White House

ce setting forth the results of the check of Bureau files concerning the
#8  Mississipgi Freedom Democratic Party. e & eH

In a memorandum dated September 10, 1964, Mr. Hoover
reported Walter W. Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, called
and stated the President wanted Jenkins to call the Director to express
the thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the
finest the President had ever seen, According to this memorandum,

Jenkins told Mr. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and
because of the work some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly
where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were
not able to be very effective. It should be noted that this particular
memorandum of Mr. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents
sent to John Dean.

- A thorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-
randum or other documents pertaining to a request having been received
from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing that the
FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that
at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House
and had a direct line at his resideme to the President so it well may be
that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it
orally with Mr. Hoover or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the
request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL
STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician
who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active
duty with the FBI have confirmed their participation on the squad under
DeLoach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there
was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic
City to fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not
feel that the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,
the instructions to the Agents were to develop advance information regard-
ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances
that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protection for
the President. Two of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover
assignment roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with

and he had with him in Atlantic City three Agents from his office and they
were aware that DeLoach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting
developments. Two Agents recalled DeLoach having a telephone conversa-
tion with Waltér Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE
AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau filés
contain a memorandum to the Attorney General dated October 7, 1963,
eaptioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., Security Matter - Communist;
Communist Influence in Racial Matters," wherein the Bureau recom-
mended that authority be granted to place a technical surveillance on
King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or at any future address
to which he may move. This memorandum was approved by Attorney
General Kennedy, October 10, 1963. A memorandum dated July 7,
1964, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist
Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the
Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the
facilities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta.
The memorandum observed that the Attorney General had already
authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since
this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by addi-
tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then
Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned
"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman at
Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in
Atlantic City. Bachman had previously received instructions from a
Division official that he explore the possibility of putting technical and
microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-
nical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available at
the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum
pointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with thé microphone _

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney General to cover

headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of
Bureau records fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization

likewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installation.
At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone
surveillance was maintained at the Seat of Government and authoriza-
tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Director
who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell dated
May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-
veillances, By memorandum dated September 27, 1965, Attorney
General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use of microphone surveil-
lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that
DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic City
mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

«

-In 1964 our investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committe was based on information that an apparent member of the
Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable activity, much
in a leadership capacity in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Confidential informants reported that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, among the various civil rights organizations, was a principal
target for Communist Party infiltration, At this same period of time our
investigation of the Congress of Racial Equality was limited to deter-
mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organiza-
tion. (While a question arises as to the justification of using a microphone
surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted
that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of
Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification
for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of available
material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1964,
concerning the technical surveillance which verifiessthat the work on
two phones in King's-reoms.at the hotekhad been «@mpleted*howeve:s
the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view
of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark files also attribute to
then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike
should be considered for the temporary Congress of Racial Equality
headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City. The only other
information contained in Newark files concerning these installations is
a handwritten log consisting of seventy-eight pages of overhears on
King's telephqnes.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well
as DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad
at the convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification of NBC.
At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves-
tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, instructions were set forth that all
Agent personnel are prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives
of any wire service for the purpose of establishing an investigative
cover. This rule was invoked after a news item appeared in the
Washington Post on June 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had
posed as a representative of the International News Service while covering

“an antidraft demonstration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1968. The
allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement
as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the
demonstration.

COVERAGE OF 1964 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
CONVENTION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

Review of Bureau records fails to establish that any specialized
coverage was afforded to the Republican National Convention held in San
Francisco in July, 1964, and the only references in our records relate
to the planning and execution by the Congress of Racial Equality of dem-
onstrations and picketing especially insofar as the nomination of Senator
Barry Goldwater was concerned, Several teletypes and communications
were submitted by San Francisco concerning the demonstrations and
follow-up letterhead memoranda were received by the Bureau and
disseminated.

letter closed with a recapitulation of the number of contacts in
each category together with the statement, "Based upon our
coverage, it appears that Soviet officials are making’ more

In early May, 1966, the President requested: that
similar information, going back to January 1, 1965, be furnished
to him, but asked that it be presented in chronological fashion
in order to give a day-to-day picture of contacts between

of a pattern of constant and continual contacts between the
Soviets and Congressional representatives. This summary, which
was dated May 5, 1966, and which consisted of 48 pages, was
delivered to the President on May 13, 1966. This summary noted
t_information contained therein was obtained from coverage
representatives and establishments of the Soviet Union in
the United States and that "The FBI has conducted no investi-
_gation of members of Congress."

Biweekly additions to this summary were subsequently
furnished to the White House. Dissemination of this material

ttructions of Director Hoover.

It should also be noted that on July 27, 1970,

to the President, advised that Mr. Haldeman wanted any
information possessed by the FBI relating to contacts between
Soviet nationals and Members of Congress and its staff.

Re: Information Concerning Contacts Between
Representatives of the Soviet Union and
Members or Staff Personnel of the United States
Congress Furnished to the White House at the
Request of the President

The President continued by stating he would like
Director Hoover to have prepared a chronological study,
beginning in July, 1964, and continuing up to the present
time, of all legislators who have called at the Soviet Embassy.
He stated he felt such a study would clearly reflect that
Senators J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and Wayne L. Morse
of Oregon had been in constant contact with the Soviet Embassy.

Mr. Hoover subsequently instructed that the requested

Material be prepared for transmittal to the White House and
_ this was accomplished by means of a letter to Mr. W. Marvin

Watson, Special Assistant to the President, dated March 21,
1966, which transmitted the requested summary of information’
which was dated March 18, 1966. The summary set forth in
chronological order contacts by each Senator, Representative,

or staff member who had contacts with the Soviet Embassy during
the period July 1, 1964, through March 17, 1966. The transmittal
letter closed with a recapitulation of the number of contacts in
each category together with the statement, "Based upon our
coverage, it appears that Soviet officials are making more
contacts with Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas,

Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, Senator George McGovern
of South Dakota, and Senator Wayne L. aidiag of Oregon % than with
other United States legislators."

The summary, which comprised 67 pages, stated:

On March 22, 1966, Mr. Hoover, noting that the
President was very pleased with the material, instructed that
similar material be prepared, bringing this matter up to date
every ten days to two weeks.

Re: Information Concerning Contacts Between
Representatives of the Soviet Union and
Members or Staff Personnel of the United States
Congress Furnished to the White House at the ~
Request of the President

In early May, 1966, the President requested: that
similar information, going back to January 1, 1965, be furnished
to him, but asked that it be presented in chronological fashion
in order to give a day-to-day picture of contacts between
Congressional representatives and Soviet officials. The
President felt that such a summary would give a concise picture
of a pattern of constant and continual contacts between the
Soviets and Congressional representatives. This summary, which
was dated May 5, 1966, and which consisted of 48 pages, was
delivered to the President on May 13, 1966. This summary noted
that information contained therein was obtained from coverage
of representatives and establishments of the Soviet Union in
the United States and that "The FBI has conducted no investi-~

_gation of members of Congress."

Biweekly additions to this summary were subsequently
furnished to the White House. Dissemination of this material
to the White House was terminated in January, 1969, on the
instructions of Director Hoover.

It should also be noted that on July 27, 1970,
Larry Higby, Assistant to Mr. H. R. Haldeman, Special Assistant
to the President, advised that Mr. Haldeman wanted any
information possessed by the FBI relating to contacts between
Soviet nationals and Members of Congress and its staff.
Material concerning such matters which had been previously
furnished to the White House at the request of President Johnson
was reviewed and a statistical compilation of such contacts,
from January 1, 1967, was furnished to Mr. Haldeman as an
enclosure to a letter dated duly 29, 1970, c¥assified "Top
Secret." The statis#iis wersiilicolgng dowstts toMenatoes, £%
Representatives and staff employees. This report noted the
information therein was developed through FBI coverage of pacuaa
Soviet officials and establishments in Washington, D. C.,
and included two examples of Soviet intelligence initiatives
directed against Capitol Hill without identifying the Soviets
or Americans involved.

On August 4, 1970, Mr. Tom C. Huston, Staff Assistant

Mr. Haldeman's request had originated as a result of a con-

then President Richard M. Nixon in which Senator Jackson
indicated one of his staff directors believed there had been
an increase in Soviet interest on Capitol Hill. Mr. Huston
requested the FBI interview this employee; and with the

WILLIAM R, ANDERSON
FORMER UNITED STATES
CONGRESSMAN
(DEMOCRAT - TENNESSEE)

nN
An article in the January 19, 1975, issue of the Washington Post
written by Ronald Kessler stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation in-
vestigated former Congressman William R. Anderson of Tennessee after he
made remarks critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This article
states in part:

*, . . an informed source said Hoover had ordered derogatory material
gathered on Rep, Anderson, who was defeated in 1972 after serving four
terms. The order was given after Anderson criticized Hoover for naming
Daniel and Philip Berrigan as having plotted to kidnap a high government
official. . . In complying with Hoover's order, agents in Nashville office
of the FBI first provided relatively inocuous information about Anderson,
the source said. But Hoover ordered them to try again, the source said,
and this time they reported that the madam of a house of prostitution had
said she thought Anderson had visited her place of business several years
earlier. The purported identification was made from a photo the agents
showed of Anderson, he added.” *

The source of the above information was not identified in the news article.

The former Special Agent in Charge of our Memphis, Tennessee, Office

siderable publicity concerning charges made by U. S. Representative Anderson
from Tennessee regarding the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Anderson's
charges generally reflected on the integrity, ability and accomplishments of the

Bureau and on the Director himself. : ’

He recalled that shortly after the publicity an Agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in Nashville, Tennessee, received a call from an old-
time "madam" who had furnished the Agent with information for many years
concerning prostitution. She volunteered to the Agent that she was irritated
by comments made by Anderson and said that she had supplied Anderson with
prostitutes for the past six or seven years at various motels in the Nashville
metropolitan area,

’ He said this information was volunteered and unsolicited and no in-
vestigation was conducted. The information was furnished in a personal letter
to Mr. Hoover by the then Special Agent in Charge of the Memphis Office
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Former Agents in the Nashville, Tennessee, area during the pertinent
period were recently contacted. They have advised that they never investigated
Anderson and had never shown Anderson's photograph.

The Washington Post news article quoted earlier mentioned that the
identification of Anderson was made from a photograph shown by Agents. A
review of the files of the Memphis Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
disclosed only one picture of Anderson and it appeared in an article in the
Nashville Banner on January 21, 1975. There was no photograph of Anderson
in the files which might have been shown by Agents at an earlier date.

There was no evidence in the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
showing that former Director Hoover ". . . ordered derogatory material
gathered on Rep, Anderson."' There is no photograph of Anderson in the
files of our Memphis Office as noted abov¢. There is no evidence that a
photograph of Anderson was shown by Agents and no evidence that an in-
vestigation of Anderson was conducted in relation to his association with
prostitutes,

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA
WALTER W. JENKINS)

Item 5 of the "Sullivan Memoranda" reads:

"Re: Walter W. Jenkins

a
“President Johnson called the FBI on October 27, 1964
to give instructions that Andy Choka (involved with
Jenkins) be pinned down more fully. President Johnson
said he had noted the FBI had not asked Choka if he had
known Grenier (phonetic) or Burch of the Republican
Party. President Johnson said FBI must ask
Choka this question. President Johnson aiso said that
the FBI should bring pressure to bear on the Park
Policeman who had lied about Jenkins attempting to
solicit him in LaFayette Park on the night of October 7,
1964. The FBI in keeping with Johnson's wishes had
already asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart Udall
Secretary of the Department of Interior to bring
pressure on the Park Policeman with no results.
President Johnson next discussed in some length on
the ‘unfortunate publicity' about the flowers which
Mr. Hoover had sent to Mr’ Jenkins, Instructions were
given to have FBI agents 'bear down on Choka with
respect to his nowledge of the two Republican National
Committee members mentioned as well ad once again |

- Gadstiohing him as to a®possible frame up." ape

memorandum reports the contents of a call from President Lyndon B.
Johnson to C. D. DeLoach on October 27, 1964.

Pertinent portions of the memorandum follow: ¥ .

"The President called me at approximately 2:10 p.m. today
while Iwas at lunch. He stated he had thoroughly read the big report
sent over to him on the Jenkins matter. He stated he thought it was very
complete and that the FBI had done a good job. He mentioned there was
one thing that was bothering him. He then stated that he felt we should
aitempt to tie Andy Choka down a little further. He noted that we had
not asked Choka if he had known Grenier (ph.) or Burch of the Republican
Party. The President stated in order to round out this picture more
complete he thought we should contact Choka once again and ask him
these specific questions. ,

2 :

"The President asked me if I thought that Choka could have
been part of a frame-up. I told him there was no evidence to this effect,
that Choka had a previous record of sexual offenses and that apparently
he had been in the basement men's room of the YMCA on 10/7/64 with
the hopes of finding a person to commit a homosexual act with.

"The President . . . did think we should attempt to bring
further pressure on the Park Policeman who had lied about Jenkins
attempting to solicit him in LaFayette Park on the night of 10/7/64.

: "I told the President I had asked Bill Moyers to have Stewart
Udall, Secretary of the Department of Interior, to bring pressure on the
Park Policeman (Shoemaker) so that this man would reveal all facts in
his possession. The President stated Udall had already tried to bring
pressure on this man and that such pressure amounted to nothing."

The DeLoach memorandum‘continued that the President discussed
the Director's sending flowers to Jenkins at the time of Jenkins' hospitaliza-
tion. The memorandum stated that the President dwelt at some length on

the "unfortunate publicity"' about the flowers. a

The Washington Star News, a Washington, D. C., daily news-
paper, carried an article‘in the January 31, 1975, edition, page A-4,
under an Associated Press release captioned "Boggs! Son Tells of Files
on Warren Panel,'' The article quotes Tom H. Boggs, Jr., son of the
late Representative Hale Boggs, as claiming that in 1970 his father gave
him dossiers which the FBI compiled on critics of the Warren Commission
in an attempt to discredit them, According to the article, Boggs’ son
stated "they weren't basically sex files. They had some of that element
but most of the material dealt with left wing organizations these people
belonged to."

Tom H. Boggs, Jr., declined to identify all seven of the critical
authors but stated that writer Edward Jay Epstein and lawyer Mark Lane
were among the individuals on whom he had information. Boggs, Jr.,
reportedly stated that the information given him by his father included a
photograph of one of the seven engaging in an unnatural sex act with two
women,

information of this nature was ever disseminated directly to Hale Boggs

The seven individuals mentioned in the memorandum to
Mr. Watson were Edward Jay Epstein; Joachim Joesten; Penn Jones, Jr.;
Mark Lane; Richard H. Popkin; Leo Sauvage; Harold Weisberg.

In a cover letter to Mr. Watson he was advised that Bureau
files contained no pertinent data with respect to Sylvan Fox, an author
critical of the investigation surrounding President Kennedy's assassina-
tion. ue

In addition to background information regarding the seven critics
of the Warren Commission, we disseminated to Mr. Watson at the White
House one facial photograph of Mark Lane, one obscene photograph of Mark
Lane lying on a bed, a hand printed instruction by Lane regarding perverted
sexual acts and signed statements from two women concerning the per-
formance of unnatural sex acts on the person of Mark Lane.

Regarding the dissemination concerning Mark Lane, we
received information that in 1962 the District Attorney of Queens County,
New York, conducted an investigation of Mark Lane for alleged sodomy.

\ At that time statements from two women were received along with an
obscene photograph of Lane and hand printed instruction which Lane gave
to one of the girls in order that they could perform upon his person
perverted sexual acts of a sadistic masochistic nature.

The background information furnished to the White House
regarding Mark Lane indicated that he is an attorney, born in New York
City on February 24, 1927, and that he has a long history of affiliation
with Communist Party front groups and organizations which have been
-cited as subversive, :

The "Daily Worker" for May 27, 1953, states that the National
Lawyers Guild held an election of officers on May 26, 1953, and that Mark
Lane was elected an ex officio member of the board of directors of the
Nektional@fawyei's Guild. Th tDaily@Wvorket* was an East Coast com-
munist newspaper. The House Committee on Un-American Activities has
described the National Lawyers Guild as the foremost legal bulwark of
the Communist Party.

Lane was elected to the New York State Assembly in-1960 and
in May, 1962, he was defeated in an attempt to secure the nomination as
a candidate for United States House of Representatives from the 19th

Congressional District in New York. A source reported inyconnection
with Lane's attempt to secure this nomination that a meeting of the
Manhattan County Communist Party Coordinating Committee was held
on April 5, 1962, to discuss election problems in the 19th Congressional
District. It was reported that the speaker at this meeting stated that the
Committee had to support Mark Lane as the candidate since his views
were most consistent with the "people's program.". The speaker

* further indicated that a victory for Lane would be a tremendous victory
for the progressive movement.

In the Washington Star News article the name of Edward Jay
Epstein was also mentioned by Tom H. Boggs, Jr. According to Bureau
files, Epstein was born Recember 6, 1935, and wrote "Inquest" as his
Master's thesis at Cornell University. In 1958 he traveled as a tourist
in the Soviet Union and described himself as a student residing in New
York City. As of November 8, 1966, the date of FBI dissemination
to the White House regarding critics of the Warren Commission, Epstein

. had no known arrest record.

‘No information was developed or furnished to the White House
- concerning immoral conduct on the part of the seven above-listed critics
of the Warren Commission with the exception of the information furnished
regarding Mark Lane.

The Sulliyan memoranda on page 3 states that President
Lyndon B. Johnson telephonically requested the FBI to locate Don Reynolds
(a personality in the Bobby Baker case) and ascertain how Reynolds disposed
of $25, 000 which he allegedly received. President Johnson reportedly
was of the opinion that Reynolds utilized the funds for bribery purposes
on behalf of the Republican Party. Sullivan states in his memoranda
that President Johnson's request was complied with but the results were
negative.

A review of Bureau files disclosed a memorandum dated
September 1, 1964, from Mr. Rosento Mr. Belmont, reporting a telephone
request for investigation from the Deputy Attorney General Nicholas
Katzenbach to Inspector Robert Wick.

_ Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach advised that the President
(Johnson) telephonically requested the Department of Justice conduct
investigation regarding an allegation by Senator John J. Williams. Senator
Williams stated on September 1, 1964y in the Senate, that a payoff was
alleged to have been made by Don Reynolds. Investigation was immediately

Bobby Baker investigation, in which it was mentioned that the
FBI turned down requests for a body recorder and also for the
contents of a communication from Mr. Hoover.to President Johnson
regarding this matter, the following is submitted.

By memorandum dated 3/25/65, Assistant Attorney General,
(AAG) Criminal Division, requested that the FBI take necessary
steps to place a body recorder on the person of Wayne L. Bromley
to record the conversations of Bromley with Clifford L. Jones and
Bobby Baker. This would have necessitated placing a recorder on
the person of Bromley prior to the time he left Washington, D. C.,
as he was being met in Los Angeles by Jones upon his arrival.:
Bromley, a Washington, D. C., Attorney and close associate of
Baker, was cooperating with the FBI and had testified before
the Baker Grand Jury. Jones is a former Lieutenant Governor
of the State of Nevada and is an Attorney as well as a member
of one of the corporations which was furnishing cash to Baker
for his assistance.

: By letter dated 3/26/65 from the Director to Mr. Herbert
J. Miller, AAG, he was informed the Department's request for

the use of the body recorder on the’ person of Bromley was ~

that Acting Attorney General Clark had advised an official of
this Bureau on 12/23/66 that after the FBI's refusal to monitor
the meeting in Los Angeles, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service or the Bureau of Narcotics was contacted, and that he
was certain it was the Bureau of Narcotics that handled the
monitoring. No documentation of this conversation located.

On 1/17/67 Assistant to the Director Cartha D. DeLoach
was called to the White House by Marvin Watson and Watson
referred to the Director's memorandum to the President setting
forth the information that the FBI had refused a request to
utilize a recording device in the Baker case. Watson furnished
information that inasmuch as the Bureau of Narcotics had later
handled this matter for the Department of Justice, the President
had demanded a summary memorandum from the Secretary of Treasury

utilize a recording device in the Baker case. Watson furnished
information that inasmuch as the Bureau of Narcotics had later
handled this matter for the Department of Justice, the President
had demanded a summary memorandum from the Secretary of Treasury
concerning the matter. Watson also indicated the President was
quite exercised about the fact the FBI had properly refused only
to have the Treasury honor the request of the Department of Justice.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION CONCERNING
DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST FOR BODY RECORDER
IN BOBBY BAKER INVESTIGATION IN 1965

He also requested that it should be specifically pointed out
whether any of the aforementioned individuals were close to
Bobby Kennedy. Mr. Watson further stated the President did

not want any record made of this request and wanted the informa-
tion furnished to him in blind memorandum form. Information was
prepared in blind memorandum form regarding these individuals
and furnished to the President and, with the exception of

former AAG Miller, our file review and liaison representatives
did not develop any inférmation indicating any association of
the individuals with Robert F. Kennedy.

| \ positions, By the time they are 2Lyears of age they are almost ready. to leave
i college and have been subjected to the corrosive influence and brainwashing of ultra-
| jMbexal, and radical professors.

OBSERVATIONS:

The important consideration, of course, is to protect the Bureau from
\ possible embarrassment. ' Many of our 18, 19 and 20-year-old men and women are
, highly intelligent, mature, and loyal citizens. This has recently been recognized
| by the Congress.in lowering the.voting.age to.18 years. It is felt the same concept
_ 4 can logically be applied to the revolutionary conflict at home and particularly on

awe na A earth as Irerttcay 4 ALAA. KR

y Development of all security and racial informants, regardless of age, is
very closely supervised at the Seat of Government. It is felt that selective use of
[the 18 through 20-year -old age bracket on specific SAC recommendation and with
[close scrutiny at the Seat of Government can be of tremendous benefit, These
{matters will continue to be very carefully looked into during all field inspections.

i

RECOMMENDATION:

_. That the appropriate Manual citations be changed to read "Students
under age 18, . . ." If approved, to be implemented by Domestic Intelligence

Division. :

memorandum states, these are indeed critical times. No one can predict
with accuracy the outcome of the revolutionary, s Struggle going on in
this country at this time. Those under 20° years of age are piaying a
predominant roie in campus violence. Two of the subjects in the
University of Wisconsin case are under 20. Logic dictates that we

RE: USE OF CONCEALED RECORDING DEVICES %

Recordings obteined by Bureau Agents and sovrees are
te be handled as evidence and should be reviewed in the field
office responsible for obtaining same. Inflammatory remarks
are to be set forth verbatim and other pertinent data summarized
in a letterhead memorandum. A copy of the tape should then be
forwarded to the Bureau.

. T€ it is not possible to cover public appearances
through use of a concealed recording device, or otherwise
zecorded for evidentiary use, the Bureau is to be advised in

_ the cover commnication transmitting the letterhead memorandum

why such action was hot possible,

In those instances where copies of taped recordings
of.speeches by Black and Hew Left: extremists are furnished by

police departments, for example, it will be necessary to similarly :

review the material, report the information as outlined above,
and forward a cepy to the Bureau, Additionally, under these
eireunstances, you should advise in the cover commenication of
the location of the original tape and the identity of the
individual who can introduce it in a court of law.

Te. is expected that all Agent personnel engaged in
Raciel and New left investigations will be familiar with the
contents of this communication.

ed authority to instruct the field to expand the use of concealed
recording devices in covering such appearances.. Since that time, the |
field has reported a large number of such appearances and Special .
Agents in Charge (SACs) have always demonstrated sound judgment in,
affording such coverage under secure conditions. On a number af fs
occasions, because of extremely short notice concerning appearake
there has been insufficient time to obtain Bureau authority. Besause
of this, valuable evidentiary material has béen lost. Recordings are
the best possible evidence of extremist statéments actually made in
the event of prosecutive action. This matter was discussed in depth
at captioned conference with field supervisors, It was the unanimous
recommendation of those supervisors that present instructions con-
cerning such recordings should be modified in one respect to allow
SACs to arrange on their own ee i for re¢ recordings ia

160-¢ECD on A
The reconfnsrdb$ion aie one SACs have uniformly demon-

strated excellent judgment in making such recordings to date and
should ke given authority to record public appearances by black and
New Left extremists whenever full security can be assured ex cept when.
such appearances are at educational institutions. When at educational
en CUS ona sei ursons.
3 [instieutions, the field must still obtain prior Bureau authority.
This will give thé field necessary flexibility to record public
appearances even when advance notice is extremely short. The modi-
aaa will in no way supersede or conflict with authority to re-
i. cord statements given in individual cases under investigation such
co yas the Antiriot Law investigations which arose out of violence at the

Memorandum G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C. Sullivan 5/21/69 obtain-
ed authority to instruct the field to expand. the use of concealed
recording devices in covering such appearances. Since that time, the
field has reported a large number. of such appearances and Special.
Agents. in Charge (SACs) have always demonstrated sound judgment in,
affording-such coverage under secure conditions. On a number
occasions, because of extremely short notice concerning appear: Sy
there has been insufficient time to obtain Bureau authority. Because
of this, valuable evidentiary material has bden lost. Recordings are
the best possible evidence of extremist statéments actually made in
the event of prosecutive action. This matter was discussed in depth
at captioned conference with field supervisors, It was the unanimous
recommendation of those supervisors that present instructions con-
cerning such recordings should be modified in one respect to allow
SACs to arrange on their own initiative for recordings.
ie reG i VEL D ROA (3
-The recomenkb3 ion has merit. SACs have uniformly demon-
strated excellent judgment in making such recordings to date and
should ke given authority to record public appearances by black and
New Left extremists whenever full security can be assured except when
| such appearances are at educational institutions. When at “educational
institutions, the field must still obtain prior Bureau authority.
This will give thé field necessary flexibility to record public
i appearances even when advance notice is extremely short. The modi-
wfication will in no way supersede or conflict with authority to re-

The Black Panther Party/s (BPP) influence is increasing
at a rapid rate; therefore, there is a need for a conference at
the Seat of Government with the racial supervisors handling BPP
activity in the 34 active Panther field. divisions in order that
we may analyze our operation for the purpose of insuring that our
program is efficient.

The recent release of Huey P, Newton from jail on bail
has stimulated BPP activity. This coupled with the success of
the Plenary Revolutionary People's Constitutional Convention in
Philadelphia and the forthcoming Revolutionary People's Constitution+
al Convention scheduled for Washington, D. C., in November, is
‘definitely increasing Panther influence amongst black extremists
as well as white radical extremists. In addition, the increase
we see in violence as exhibited by the bombings, snipings and am
general assault on law enforcement, demands that there be a complete
and thorough analyses of our investigative efforts as well as our

efforts. in developing quality informants, ~ i :

Our experience in the past has shown that specia

, . Matters, have been most productive, Based on our past conferences
we initiated a number of instructions to the field and inaugurated
new programs concerning the handling of black extremist investi-
gations and the development of racial informants.

we gon ggnete dL eT Aa

To secure approval for anonymous mailing of
reproduction of newspaper column critical of Black Panther
Party (BPP).

Victor Riesel, noted labor columnist, recently
authored a column highly critical of the BPP which exposed
their viciousness including cold-blooded attacks on police.
It points out the repeated calls for murder of police that +
appear in the Panther newspaper. The column also tells of 3
a proposal by a union member that union affiliated freight .
handlers refuse to handle the shipment of the BPP newspaper.

At the recently concluded conference of field
-supervisors handling BPP matters it was unanimously recommended
that this column be reproduced and anonyously mailed to select
officials of the unions involved in handling shipments of BPP
newspapers as well as selected officials and members of police
fraternal organizations who might be in a position to encourage

such a boycott. S / 7. wl gto

This recommendation has excellent merit. Riesel's
column is outstanding and it provides us with an ideal opportunity
to bring the vicious character of the BPP to the attention of
many officials of unions who are in a position to give impetus
to the suggested boycott of the handling of BPP papers.
Such a boycott, if realized, would be a most effective means

to cut off BPP finances and ae Be

In light of the above, every field division should

cr _. amalyze its present racial informants to see if there is a
logical informant who could be used in connection with the
above proposal. This informant should be established in the
black extremist field and particularly established with the
BPP to the degree that the Party would be interested in
assisting him to flee the country. Upon completion of the

the Black Panther PartyJs (BPP) influence is increasing

at a rapid rate; therefore, there is a need for a conference at
the Seat of Government with the racial supervisors handling BPP
activity in the 34 active Panther field. divisions in order that
we may analyze our operation for the purpose of insuring that our
program is efficient, :
: The recent release of Huey P. Newton from jail on bail

has stimulated BPP activity. This coupled with the success of

the Plenary Revolutionary People's Constitutional Convention in

Philadelphia and the forthcoming Revolutionary People's Constitution-
~--~al Convention scheduled for Washington, D. C., in November, is :

‘definitely increasing Panther influence amongst black extremists .

as well as white radical extremists. In addition, the increase

we see in violence as exhibited by the bombings, snipings and

general assault on law enforcement, demands that there be a complete

Our experience in the past has shown that s
conferences concerning racial activities, especially informant
matters, have been most productive, Based on our past conferences
we initiated a number of instructions to the field and inaugurated
new programs concerning the handling of black extremist investi-

is also a need to get together with field personnel to iron
out problems, exchange ideas, and expand upon and refine 7
our BPP investigative techniques.

In view of this it is believed that we should
have a two-day conference at the Seat of Government concerning
BPP investigations and developing informants in the Party.
In order that adequate preparation can be made it is :
recommended this conference be held October 22 and 23, 1970, }) /
We are limiting this conference to the 34 Field divisions

that the field supervisor from each of these field divisions be

ADDENDUM (9/23/70), WCS:csh ~

4 I think this is a good idea. It is original, aggressive,
and .¢an be effective. The Department needs to“bé“not only ce
educated to some of the ugly realities of the Black Panthers,

but also the Department needs to be pushed into gettin: ome
prosecutive action underway. People about the country are
beginning to wonder why Something isn't being done. €or example,
only; last week I received a letter from Professor George Kennan,
of Princeton University, whom I have known for /some years. He
deplored sharply the activities of the Black Panthers, and

Our experience over the past year and the growth Al

resulted in utilization of increasing number of sophisticated
techniques, some of which have involved a number of our field
offices and occasionally Legal Attaches in Canada and Europe.
Among highly successful tangible results realized during the
past year, as a result of this program, were the disbandment
of a Black Panther Party (BPP) front group in CléveLand,

In connection with the recent Specialized Conference
held at the Seat of Government concerning Black Panther Party
(BPP) activities it was proposed that the Bureau give
consideration to having In-Service classes concerning racial

and new left activities. DEY Z

With the continuing terroristie activities being .4
__ planned and perpetrated by extremist elements (both in the
black and néw left fields) it was the opinion of the racial
supervisors attending the above conference that these matter
should be discussed in detail at In-Service classes. It was *
"recognized that these matters are allotted time at the other_
In-Service classes; however, it was felt the threats posed
by extremists in this country justify an entire In-Service

This In-Service will allow for the Bureau lecturers:
to discuss in detail with a greater number of Special Agents ~
the problems involved in the racial and new left fields
concerning intensified investigation, acts of violence, informant/
development and the necessity for developing sufficient
background data to assist in fugitive investigations when
these extremists become Bureau fugitives.

RE: OPERATION OF A RACIAL INFORMANT :
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCOVERING
THE ESCAPE ROUTE USED BY BLACK
EXTREMISTS TO FLEE THE UNITED STATES

In light of the above, every field division should
analyze its present racial informants to see if there is a
logical informant who could be used in connection with the -
above proposal. This informant should be established in the
black extremist field and particularly established with the.
BPP to the degree that the Party would be interested in
assisting him to flee the country. Upon completion of the’
review of the present racial informants, every field division
should advise the results of this review.

extremists use to leave the United States.

: “After the selection of a suitable racial informant we
would then work up a cover story for the informant which would

him to contact an appropriate official in the BPP for the purpose

hoped that the BPP contact’ would then assist our informant in
fleeing the United States by using their previously successful
escape route. If this was successful, we would then learn of this
route and be able to cut off the avenue black extremists use to

PROPOSED TWO-PAGE COLLECTION OF
EXTREMISTS' QUOTATIONS :

Tovl

ate
Tele. Room
y Holmes.
F Gandy

There is enclosed a sample of a proposed two-page
collection of quotations taken from the statements and writings
of individuals and publications of organizations representing
all spectrums of extremism.

: It is felt that such a collection, put out on a monthly
hasis, would serve many needs. It would be the most direct
way of revealing the extremity of revolutionary hatred which
these people have attained. It would expose the viciousness
and subverted aims of the extremists in their own. words, devoid
of the lame excuses of their apologists who claim, especially
in the case of black extremists, that they use a deliberately
manipulated rhetoric to stir favorable response to "social"
needs. It would prove invaluable as a ready reference for those
who make speeches, those who write speeches and articles, and
those who seek corroboration of the existence of a deadly force
threatening the security of the United States,

MEMORANDUM FOR JiR. LADD oh x

Re: Handling/of Codes, Ciphers, i i
and\ispvonage Writings in
the ‘Laboratory.

In order to facilitate the examination of code
and cipher messages received in the Laboratory in connection with current
cases three files of reference material have been set up. First, sees
there is a three by five card index file containing on each card one Soran
code word or code number group together with the file reference.
Second, there has been set up a visible file of photographic copies of
code and cipher messages and other espionage writings where the
specimen received in the Laboratory is the original copy written by
the subject of the case, Third, there is being set up a file
containing photostatic copiés of all codes and ciphers received in
current cases for comparison with new material received in the future.

In the three py five index file which has been set up,
there are being placed cards upon which is written the code group
together with the file, serial, and specimen number or mumbers of the
original message in which that code group was found. When coded
messages are received in the Laboratory, the code words appearing
therein are first searched in the available code books on hand in the
Laboratory and at the Library of Congress, In the event it has not
been possible to decode the message by this means, a separate three by
five card is then made out for each code group appearing in the message.
These cards are then placed alphabetically, or numerically, in their
proper position in the three by five card index file. At this time
it is noted whether or not the code group being placed in the file is
already present in the index, and if so the information is all then
incorporated on one card. By this means it will be possible to E.
determine whether these new code groups have previously appeared in F
unsolved messages submitted to the Laboratory in other cases. By pa
tying together messages of this sort it will permit a comparison to %

ordinarily contzin only code groups from unsolved cases.
The exception to this will be code groups found in solved
messages where some sort of private code, not found in code
books, has been used,

The second file which has been set up contains

i photographic copies of codes, ciphers and espionage writings

where, through a comparison of handwriting, handprinting, type-
writing, or other visual means, two or more cases may be
connected together, Upon receipt of the new visible file

cabinet for the anonymous letter file a separate section will

be devoted to the filing of these writings in a similar manner

to the filing of anonymous letters. ‘hen new cases are

received in the Laboratory containing the original code or

cipher message as originally written by the subject or when
original writings are received in connection with espionage
cases, these will be compared with the photographic copies already
in the file. In this way cases may be connected together by
means of handwriting or handprinting identification, by means

of typewriting identification, or by means of the manner of
making the various characters or symbols appearing in the message.
Material of this kind has been collected since the latter part

of October 1939 and will form the nucleus to be placed in the
visible file when received,

For a ninety day trial period, there is being
set up in the Laboratory a separate file containing photostatic
copies of all code and cipher messages received in the Laboratory
in current cases in order to have this material available to
the examiners for ready reference when examining new cases
containing similar material. This file will not only contain
photostatic copies of messages in the original handwriting or
typewriting as prepared by the subject but will also contain
copies of all codes and ciphers. This file will provide a
means for comparing messages received in different cases as to

- form, destination, addressee, sender, and peculiarities of

construction. This will of course obviate the necessity

of examiners calling for numerous files from the sixth floor
file room or from the Laboratory's files and will provide
amore accurate means of linking messages in different cases
together than merely relying upon an examiner's memory of
previously having seen a similar message. As the material in
the file accumulates, messages will be segregated according
to similar characteristics. It is believed that the ninety
day trial period will be sufficient to determine the
practicability of this file and at the expiration of that
period a further memorandum will be submitted.

Cipher material submitted by contributors and
having no bearing on any Bureau investigation will be filed
in Bureau file 62-26873 as at the present time. This type of
material will not be included in any of the three files mentioned
above,

Respectfully,

SUBJECT: ional Security File

For record purposes and for inclusion in the administrative file
there is set forth below the writeup on the above captioned file for
inclusion in the Annual Report for the fiscal year of 1944.

Prior to and after the outbreak of World War 11 the Bureau conducted r.
avery intensive investigative program to run down end apprehend enemy agents
engaged in espionaze, sabotage and other activities injurious to the nation.
As a result of such investigations there came to the Laboratory a great amount of
evidence to be given a scientific examination, One of the chief types of evidence
encountered in such investigations is that of a documentary nature. To be able to
tie together the activities of individuals by means of document examinations it
was necessary to set up a central clearing-house through which such material coulé
be searched and tied together.

To meet this need a study was made in an effort to determine the best
methods of classifying such material sc that such a file could be provided to

study led to a separation of the material received according to whether it was
handwritten, handprinted, typewritten or consisted of symbols, drawings etc.
Zach of these Sivisions was then broken down into subdivisions. The handwriting

Tele. Roog,

SUBJECT: NATIONAL SECURITY FILE : Rnalec

This file consists of two parts: (1) the Inactive Section, made up ™“*———
mostly of material added in connection with German Espionage cases during ~ t
World War IT and (2) the Active Section, started early in 1948, to whichis > j_ i
being added material submitted in Soviet Espionage and related Security cases} Ba ie

There are about 23,000 specimens in the Inactive Section and 456 in
the new or Active Section at the present time. Specimens are now added only
to the new section, which has the same general classifications for filing as ~~
the old section. About 350 individual specimens were searched in the file
during the calendar year 1950, with no identifications made. Approval of Assistant
Director of the Security Division is required before a specimen is searched.
Recently the inactive or old part of the file was reviewed to des
termine which sections could be destroyed without impairing the usefulness of
the file. As a result of this survey, it was recommended that certain non-
communist material, contained in approximately 80 drawers comprising the Miscel-
laneous Section of the old part of the file, be destroyed, A description of this
material was set forth on page three of a memorandum, dated November 27, 1950,
from Mr. Cadigan to Mr. Bowles.

In the memorandum from Mr. Hennrich to Mr. Belmont, dated December 5,
1950, the Security Division advises that they have no objection to the destruc-
tion of the material in the Miscellaneous Section which has no Soviet, satellite
or communist connection. ~ Accordingly,..this..material is being destroyed, with the
exception of certain Zenuine Selective Service car. g-which will be made an en-
closure in the Identity Papers File.’ Specimens containing shorthand and codes
and ciphers will be referred to Mr. Downing before they are destroyed, in case
they may be of value to the iy due tence Section.

RECOMMENDATION : f

It is recommended that the National Security File be continued and
that no other changes be made at this time. > t

SUBJECT: ~ NATIONAL SECURITY FILE

The purpose of this memorandum is to evaluate the National
Security File as of January 1, 1952.

This file consists of two parts: (1) The inactive section which
was built up during World War II and (2) the active section, started early
in 1948 to which is being added material submitted in Soviet espionage
and related security cases. It will be noted that miscellaneous sections
of the inactive section containing non-communist material were destroyed
during the past year. This was done in accordance with the memorandum from
C. E. Hennrich to A. H. Belmont dated December 5, 1950. The remaining
portion of the inactive section now comprises approximately 12,000 specimens.
The active section now contains 667 specimens. Searches in the file require
the approval of an assistant director.

—_—

275 specimens were searched in the file in 1951. Five identifications
were made. 7 7

The time required for maintaining the file is less than one hour
weekly on the basis of the present rate of adding specimens.

‘

RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that this file be continued and that
no changes be made at this time.

Holloman

SAC Letter #86 dated September 18, 195, advised the Field that . Gandy —

active searches in the National Security File would not be made unless warranted y
by special circumstances. Since January 1, 198, all new material has been added
to a new active section of the National Security File. The inactive section has
renained dormant. The inactive section contains about 16,000 photograph specimens,
mostly "Axis" material added to the file during World War II yeats. The active
section contains about 2500 photograph specimens, mostly Communist and Russian
material, and includes handwriting of all active Communist Key Figures. A review
i of the inactive section was made in December, 1947, for the purpose of determining
Hy the feasibility of removing known Communist and Russian material. The survey showed
t that 77.7% of the items reviewed were innocuous; 9.7% were 'rightist" in character-
I and of "definite intelligence significance;" 5.5% were clearly "leftist" and 7%

were of such a nature that it was not possible to determine their future value.

It was estimated that about 2000 man hours would be required for review of case
| files to determine which specimens could be removed. Since that tine it has not
| been deemed advisable to spend that much time for such a review.

Since January 1, 1953, only two searches have been made in the inactive
section and no identificationseffected. Five specimens, all in one case, were
identified in the inactive section in 1951. These specimens were determined to
have been written by a prolific crank letter writer (Bufile 100~109571 serial 6).

No other identifications have been made in the inactive file since October, 19))5.

It is believed that the inactive file no longer serves any useful purpose and should
be destroyed. Specimens in this file are photographs, negatives of which are retai. neg
in the Mechanical Section. mf

The active section of the National Sectirity File has proven of great value
since it was started in 19))8. Since that time more than 100 specimens have been
identified in this file, most of which related to subjects active in the Communist
Underground. 7

RECOMMENDATION: (1) That the inactive section of the National Security
File be destroyed since it no longer has any apparent value and (2) that the active
section be continued since it is of great value in making identifications in security—
type cases. Serer

ADDENDUM: (Espionage Section, 10/13/54 SBD:hmn) spot

Discussion with FBI Laboratory reveals inactive
section of National Security file constitutes great bulk of
material received during World War II through censorship
intercepts and during period when emphasis on combatting axis
countries. Active Section started in 1948 and constitutes more
usable material based on present Bureau emphasis on Communism
and Soviet and satellite espionage. Recognized specimens from
old espionage cases placed in Active Section. Searches against
National Security File now limited to Active Section in absence of
some indication search of Inactive Section would be worth while.
Recommendation of FBI Laboratory for destruction of Inactive :
Section believed feasible for destruction would only result in-
elimination of photographs. Original material and negatives
would still be available for specific comparisons. Only 7
alternative would be to review Inactive Section piece by piece
(estimated 2000 man hours required) to include selected
photographs in Active Section and this not believed economical
for value possibly derived. Recommend views of Internal Security
Section also be secured.

ADDENDUM: (Internal Security Section, 10/13/54 PLC:njt)

The Internal Security Section agrees with the X
recommendation of the FBI Laboratory that the inactive
section of the Wational Security file be destroyed and Lei

SUBJECT: NATIONAL SECURITY FILE

PURPOSE:

To recommend a procedure for removing obsolete materia |
from the National Security File. |
BACKGROUND: '

The file was started in 1940 and originally contained _
code and cipher specimens in addition to photographs of other .
writings pertaining to espionage and security matters. During
World War II, the file grew rapidly and by V-J Day (1945)
contained approximately 23,000 specimens. Most of this was
“Nazi material, but also included were some specimens from
Russian espionage cases such as the Alto case, Comrap, Mocase,
Cinrad, etc. :
In 1945 after V-J Day the file was declared inactive bo
due to the absence of any frequent need to search or make additions Ww
to the file. N

In 1948 an active section of the file was reinstituted
and specimens only from Soviet, Satellite,and Communist type cases
were added to the file and searches were made.

Aa

As a result of a review in 1951 to determine whether
the inactive part of the file could be destroyed, a decision to
destroy ail material in the miscellaneous section, except those
items related to Soviet, Satellite,-or Communist cases, was approved.
A further review in 1954 resulted in approval to destroy the entire
inactive section of the file with the exception of approximately 100
specimens recognized as still potentially valuable in certain Russiqn
Communist-type cases. These specimens were placed in the active -)...’
section of the file. Pree : Fj

Memorandum to Mr, Conrad
Re: NATIONAL SECURITY FILE

The active section or the new National Security File
now contains 4770 specimens (as of 12/31/60). The following
table shows the record of growth since 1948:

1959 315 ; 3937

1960 833 4770

Although discussions have been held with representatives
of the Domestic Intelligence Division concerning need for purging
the file, no review of the file has been made for this purpose
Since 1954, However, it is believed that some plan should be
instituted to remove those items that have no apparent present
or potential value. It is realized that handwriting of espionage
subjects or suspects and typewriters available to such individuals
may be of value in our investigations as long as ther lifetime.
Therefore, no definite pericd can be set for all cases as the
length of time a specimen should remein in the file. This fact
points up the needa to review each case file where consideration is
being given to removing a specimen.

Since it is felt that the file should contain only useful
material to make its operation most efficient and since an effort
should be made to keep the fjle from growing out of bounds, the
following recommendations are boing made.

1. That within the next 12 months (through June, 1962)
350 of the oldest specimens in the file be reviewed

~-2-

\NW 55154 DocId:32989639 Page 242



Memorandum to Mr, Conrad
Re; NATIONAL SECURITY FILE
80-696

for possible removal. 350 represents the average
number of specimens added to the file per year over
the past 13 years. These 350 specimens may not
represent as many as 350 case files since more than
one specimen may be related to each case.

2. That the number of specimens reviewed for possible
removal each 12-month.period represents the average
number of specimens added to the file since its
beginning in 1948. On this basis all of the specimens
added in 1948 and 1949 and some of the specimens
added in 1950 will be reviewed in the first 12-month
period, if

3. That the Laboratory examiner assigned to the case
consult with the substantive Domestic Intelligence
Division supervisor if he believes the specimen
may be removed. If the substantive supervisor
agrees, the Laboratory examiner should remove the
specimen from the file.

4, That each specimen removed be returned to the case
file only if another copy is not in file or a
negative is not available from which a copy can be
made, Otherwise, the specimen removed may be
destroyed,

5, That each specimen reviewed and retained in the
National Security File be marked on the back
“Reviewed - 1961," etc.

6. That each specimen reviewed and retained in the
file be again considered for removal in 5 years.

7. That the procedure as outlined above be reviewed
in July, 1962, and that any changes necessary be
reconmended at that time,

searches were made in the National Security File and nine
identifications were effected. During this year, 320 specimens
were removed from this file and 357 specimens were added to -
this file. Therefore, there was an increase of 37 specimens ia
to this file, making a total of 6,677 specimens. wo,

The National Security File is useful in determining

exhaustively reviewed to this end. The possibility has been
noted that, in the final analysis, an” individual such as
GREGORY, So prone to erratic statements and actions, to such wild
and obviously ridiculous charges,. ‘will in all probability

* destroy his own influence in this “field and serve as a
self-neutralizer.

further inhibit local SNCC activities, and hopefully, would,
in some measure serve to neutralize BROWN himself.

Chicago also feels that the Chicago Firearms
Registration Ordinance, which went into effect May 15, 1968,
has definite potential as a counterintelligence device, to be
directed against local militants, as for example RUSS MEEK. ss
MEEK is known to have purchased 13 differnt firearms since January,
1967, and it would appear highly unlikely these guns, if still
in his possession, have been registered. In addition to the
Chicago ordinance, a state law which requires registration of
all persons possessing firearms will go into effect September 1,
1968, The penalty for violation of the local ordinance is a
$500 fine, for violation of ee state law, | a $1, 000 fine and a
year incarceration.

Contact with ‘the local office of gun | registration has
reflected that it will be approximately another 45-60 days before
records are organized and alphabétized. MEEK is identified as
.a possible target in this regard, however, there would appear to
“be a number. 6f militants who may well be Miiadapeahaneicead

“As “the Bureau has cautioned, Chicago assures that
each specific future counterintelligence operation will be
submitted for.Bureau approval prior to taking any action.

---Developments. of.-Counterintelligence Interest

There have been no significant developments. in

_ this field since my airtels of April 22, 1968, which would

- materially alter programs and approach previously suggested.

“+ Chicago appreciates, hovever, that changing times and develop-
ments in the general RM field can have an influence on any -
counterintelligence operation. Chicago will remain alert
to any such development, and when any situation arises,
relative to an individual or organization, which offers

‘promise and potential as a counterintelligence operation,

~.an appropriate communication will be promptly submitted.

eee It might also be noted that in general, the
5 assessment of the local Diack nationalist movement, as Set
& . ° out in our airtel of April 22, 1968, under the above caption,
remains as noted. It was pointed out that GREGORY had threatened
to disrupt the Democratic National Convention, in August, 1968,
however, as the Burau is aware, he has cancelled his demonstration
“plans for before and during this” convention, and is currently
incarcerated. : Fl F

Chicago assures the Bureau that full and continuing |
attention is devoted to this aspect of our operation, its
potential value is well appreciated and this office will remain
alert and receptive to any opportunity to accomplish and
establish a productive counterintelligence operation.

: Set forth below is the periodic progress letter

referenced Bureau airtel under captionsas instructed.

1. Operations Under Consideration

Subsequent to the above referenced Chicago
communication, this office has had several counterintelligence
operations under consideration. A review of the income
tax returns of HERBERT MOHAMMED, one of the heads of the
Nation of Islam (NOI), has been completed, HERBERT MOHAMHED
having been earlier designated by Chicago as a primary io \
counterintelligence target. It was determined, however,
through this review that this individual appears to have
submitted accurate income tax returns for the past several
years and the anticipated counterintelligence approach on
this basis was judged to be inappropriate.

Several additional counterintelligence approaches
to the NOI have subsequently be considered, in reference to
NOL units in San Antonio and Phoenix; however, for reasons
set forth in Chicago communications of October 4, 1968 and
Osteber 16, 1968, under the above caption, such activities
as considered were deemed to be inadvisable.

In relation to-the NOI specifically, Chicago
continually monitors closely the activities of this
group with the end in view of developing effective
counterintelligence techniques directed at either the organization
or its leadership. In the event an opportunity -:arises where
a productive counterintelligence measure appears in
order, Chicago will immediately submit specifics of such
approach for the Bureau's approval.

Reference has been made in the above referred to
Chicago communication to the state and local Gun Ownership
and Registration Ordinanceswhich appear to render such
possession or ownership on the part of bhack nationalists HE
@ vulnerable area in the event information exists that they at
are in possession of firearms illegally. Chicago is in
the process of initiating a file review concerning such
selected cases, the results of this review to be utilized
in a close check of the records of both skte and local law oa
enforcement and regulatory agencies, The records of these
agencies have only just recently been determined as having been
placed in order for an effective review along these lines to
be made,

Many of these militants are known in the past to have
been in possession of weapons and where information can be
developed reflecting that they are currently in possession
of firearms, ior are suspected of being in possession of fire-
arms, appropriate liaison will be exploited to utilize these
statutes to the extent possible against the militants in
question. Such a program will be submitted to the
Bureau for approval, prior to any specific such action being
taken by Chicago,

CG 157-2209 ~ Seues a este as esaueHeesCe SEECZI

: Chicago continues to closely follow the activities
of ROBERT BROWN, referred to in referenced letter of
duly 2, 1968, as a primary counterintelligence target. He
was recently turned down for military service and
consequently will continue to be active locally. He is the
former head of the Chicago and Midwest group of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and most recently
has indicated his conversion to or formation of a local
branch of the Black Panther Party, headquartered in Oakland,
California, This is a very recent development and the extent
of the organization of this group in terms of membership and
possible influence locally is as yet difficult to establish.
This situation was seferred to at some length in-a Chicago
communication under the above caption, Octoberl4d, 1968, and
the situation is relatively unchanged from that time.

In addition, however, a Chicago racial source
close to BROWN has advised that he has recently expressed a
desire to "take over" the remains of the Chicago Chapter of cd
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), this group having
been expelled from National CORE in early October, 1968.
This expulsion came about as a result of a September, 1968,
walkout on. the part of the Chicago Chapter from the National
CORE Convention heid in St. Louis, Missouri.

BROWN and the head of the local CORE group, ROBERT
LUCAS, have never been friendly and BROWN had stated his desire
to remove LUCAS from the leadership of this group and place it
under the Black Panther Party banner, meaning by this under his
own leadership. To complicate this situation somewhat; however,
this former CORE group, under the leadership of LUCAS, has only
recently organized itself into a new black organization calling
itself Black Liberation Alliance, formed at the national
meeting held over the weekend of October 18-20, 1968, at
Columbus, Ohio. BROWN did not attend this affair and the position
he will take as a result of this development is not yet clear,
It is believed, however, that this situation,

due in large measures té6 the friction among personalities
involved, offers some opportunity for exploitation under a
counterintelligence approach. At present, the situation
appears to be too formative and nebulous for a specific
technique to be intelligently developed.

In short regarding the above situation, within
a period of little more than a month, the Chicago CORE
Chapter, together with a rather limited number of adherents in
other cities, has moved from a-CORE group in good standing
to a new and somewhat organized black group. It would appear
that the early stages of the development of this group
would offer a good opportunity to inhibit its effectiveness
and as soon as Chicago can analyze the situation and
develop what appears an effective approach, a specific
recommendation for a counterintelligence action will be
submitted for Bureau approval,

JAMES HARVEY, a male Negro, age 22, the founder
and organizer of the Afro-American Students Association was
alse referred to in referenced Chicago ietter as a likely ian
counterintelligence target. An analysis of his most recat
activities would reflect that he is at present in a position
where he might well be vulnerable to a well thought out
counterintelligence approach, He has, until very recently,
engaged in no significant local militant activities;
however, within the past month has emerged as a principal
“adult advisor" to several individuals and black youth
groups instrumental in the organization and implementation of
black student boycotts and unrest generally within the Chicago
Public School System. HARVEY operates principally out of
the Umoja (unity) Black Students Center on Chicago's south
side and appears to have been a substantial influence on this
movement which has been of significant success in terms of its
effect on schools in Chicago's ghetto community. In
consideration of counterintelligence approaches to HARVEY,

-4-

—attention will be devoted to his travel to Czechoslovakia

during 1968, as well as his summer of 1968 travel to Japan
where “he reportedly was in contact with communist orientated
student and youth groups. During 1968 it was also determined
that HARVEY in the past has advised his local draft board of
homosexual activities on his part, which activities have
served as the basis for his exclusion from military service.
It appears possible that the above as well as additional

past activities on his part might well be utilized in
possibly compromising him and to some extent the black school
boycott movement with which he is to some extent involved.
Again, prior to the inception of any counterintelligence
activities, Chicago will submit a specific recommendation to
the Bureau for its approval.

2. Operations Being Effected

No counterintelligence operations are currently
in progress in this field in Chicago; however, as the
information set forth previously would reflect, Chicago
anticipates that very shortly recommendations to initiate such ..
operations will be forthcoming.

3. ‘Tangible Results

No tangible results have as yet been forthcoming
since the qapepenon lt of this program in the black nationalist
field.

4, Developments ‘of Counterintelligence Interest

: Information reflecting on this captioned subject
matter has been referred to in large measure under the first
item above. In short, however, the most significant
developments locally would appear to be represented in the
expulsion of Chicago CORE from the national group with the
development of a new black nationalist organization involving
these former members of GORE; development-.of*a local ‘Chapter of the Blac
Panther Party and a possible rivalry between this group and
the leader of the new black organization referred to previously;

~ he emergence of the high school age black student groups

- at the present as the most violent and possibly militant
black groups active locally. Attempts to develop an effective
counterintelligence approach locally are consequently being
directed at thése areas of development.

The Chicago black nationalist scene generally
continues to be a fragmented one, characterized by a number
of small and relatively ineffective groups and individuais,
none of whom have indicated a willingness or ability to
work together or to polarize these to some extent competitive

am

groups into a united front-type organization or grouping. Chicago

feels that through an effective and well thought out counter-
intelligence approach, it may-be possible to develop pregrams
which will in some measure contribute toe the

continuation of this situation and prevent the emergence
locally of a group or individual who may serve as a unifying
force within the black nationalist grouping. Chicago will
remain continually alert to explore and exploit every avenue
for possible counterintelligence activities directed at the
black nationalist field which appears to hold potential for ~
accomplishing this end. Any such development or technique
will be immediately made available to the Bureau for its
consideration and approval prior to inception by Chicago.

Re Chicago letter (quarterly progress) dated 10/25/68.
Set forth hereinafter is the periodic progress
letter concerning captioned matter, as requested in Bureau
airtel dated March 4, 1968, under the captions as instructed:

1) Operations Under Consideration

On a continuing basis Chicago is in the process of
analyzi ng and considering the constantly changing local
Black Nationalist situation from the viewpoint of the
development of an effective counterintelligence program.
At the present time emphasis is being placed upon the develop-
ing Black Panther Party (BPP) group which has only recently
opened offices on Chicago's west side and which is now actively
recruiting and establishing itself as a functional organization _
locally. This situation remains somewhat fluid and as yet
no specific counterintelligence program has been developed (|

Uiited to official proceedings by

it may nut be disclosed to unauthorized person-

Is weet
nel without the express approval of the FBI .

for this reason.

As an example, in the initial stages here of the /
establishment of the BPP group there was conflict between KA
rival factions, one recognized by the parent organization -in
Oakland, California, the other unsanctioned. The rivalry
between such militantly orientated persons briefly threatened
to erupt into physical confrontation on several occasions,
however, before this situation could be exploited the problem
was resolved and the group merged under the leadership of
. ROBERT BROWN, former Focal leader of the Student Non Voilent
Coordinating Committee The personalities which have sub-
sequently emerged as Bominant within the BPP locally are, in
addition to BROWN, ROBERT RUSH, FRED HAMPTON, Maywood, Illinois,
and aise FERGUSON.

on the BPP, anticipates the submission of such communication
on or prior to December 16, 1968,

By ‘letter November 22, 1968, Chicago submitted specific
counter intelligence recommendations concerning JAMES HARVEY,
local Black Nationalist personality, who has most recently
been an influential advisor -to young black students in Chicago
who have been involved in student boycotts on the high school
level; No response as yet has been forthcoming and Chicago
will take no action regarding the recommendations submitted
without prior Bureau approval, Chicago is continuing to attempt
to isolate instances regarding local Black Nationalists who

. have been in possession of firearms in the past and who appear
to possibly be in violation of local and state firearms
provisions. It is anticipated that such a review will be
completed shortly and where appropriate, communication will
be submitted to the Bureau with specific recommendations
contained therein, It appears in some instances however, that
action in this regard may be taken locally which is not purely
counter intelligence in nature, a

An example of such was the recent instance where in
connection with a review of background information concerning
JEFF FORT, local leader of the Blackstone Rangers, south side
Chicago Negro gang it was determined that a warrant was out-—
standing for FORT for failure to pay a fine of $50,00 on a
disorderly conduct conviction, In conversation with the
personnel of the Chicago Police Department, Gang Intelligence
Unit, this information was made available and it was agreed
that if an arrest warrant for FORT was executed at his residence,
a search could then be made of the premises and contraband
such as firearms or narcotics might possibly be located,

This was in fact done, as set forth in Chicago airtel
and letterhead memorandum of December 9, 1968, under the
caption JEFF FORT, Contempt of Congress, Miscellaneous -
Information Concerning. When the arrest warrant was served on
FORT a search was made by Police Department representatives
of the premises at his residence and a ,22 caliber four shot
derringer pistol was located. As a result FORT was subsequently
charged with having an unregistered weapon in his possession
as well as Unlawful Use of a Weapon, He is scheduled to appear

a

CG 157-2209 ese

in court on December 18, 1968, to answer to these charges.
It might.also be noted in passing that Chicago continues to _
“maintain _periodic contact: with Source

approved by the Bureau for counterintelligence
usage sometime ago, but primarily against the NOI, These
contacts have been amplified recently by virtue primarily of
changing times and events to embrace the Black Nationalist
field generally. The contacts with SouAC €, informal in nature,
are considered to have been directly responsible for recent
statements by him, widely reported in the Chicago press
media, critical of gang influences in the Ghetto as well as
Black Nationalist groups, the latter described by him as
AiRecT BroTe -Tead ing ard ‘ideatify Sougce

It is felt fouRCe will certainly continue to speak
out in such fashion and the contact by Chicago productive
. of such will continue. :
In referenced Chicago letter reference was made to
possible friction between ROBERT BROWN, above, and ROBERT
. LUCAS, the latter the National head of the newly formed Black
Liberation Alliance (BLA). Since referenced letter no significant
developments have taken place in this regard and no further a
information has been developed reflecting any interest on the -
part of BROWN in this group. The BLA holds regular meetings,
however, to date less than 10 individuals have actually joined
the organization, its activities limited aimost exclusively to
these meetings and to such activities as literature distribution.
At the present time BLA appears to be floundering and to have
no real or apparent support within the Negro community or from
Black Nationalists in particular. It is felt a counterintelligence
interest at this time in the BLA is not warranted.

2) Operations Being Effected <

Reference has previously been made to the periodic
contact with Source. to this end. It has also been
noted that Chicago is awaiting Bureau authority to implement
a counterintelligence program against JANES HARVEY. Recom-
mendations regarding HARVEY were submitted on November 22, 1968.

Chicago also will continue to selectively advise
local authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists
appear vulnerable to arrest on local charges, in instances
where such information is either not available or apparent

to them. This is in reference to such instances as that set
forth previously involving JEFF FORT.

3) ‘Tangible Results : ij

In this refard, the remarks of SoURCe §. _ alluded
to previously and the arrest of FORT both appear as tangible
results of Chicago counterintelligence activity.

4) Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

The principal development locally, subsequent to
referenced letter, would appear to be the emergence of the
BPP Chapter referred to previously under the leadership of
ROBERT BROWN and his associates. The question of the ability
of this group to provide a unifying and polarizing influence
within the local Black Nationalist community remains to be
seen. Chicago will very closely follow the development and
activities of this group, through knowledgeable BPP sources,
and will submit counterintelligence suggestions in the bi-monthly
letter requested by the Bureau as instructed.

1. Operations Under Consideration

Since the above referenced letter, Chicago has
continued to closely follow local developments in the Black
Nationalist field, with the development of effective counter-
intelligence techniques constantly in mind, Although all ~
facets of Black Nationalist activities and groups are so
considered, the local Black Panther Party (BPP) chapter and
its activities continue to receive particular attention. This
is due to the admittedly violent and militant nature of the
BPP, aswell as the volatile nature of the individuals who
compose both its leadership and membership. :

. Chicago is under Bureau instructions to submit on
a two-week basis a counterintelligence proposal regarding
the BPP, and since referenced letter a-number of specific
proposals have been submitted and approved. Chicago has
prepared and mailed four separate anonymous communications,
“concerning JAMES PHILIP HARVEY (approved Bureau letter
- December 10, 1968), JEFF FORT (approved Bureau letter
January 30, 1969), ABDUL KENYATTA (approved Bureau letter

a A detailed analysis of the use of feforter
‘was set forth in Chicago airtel of February 17,

1969... In short, it was noted that the NOI was shown

publicly as more of a business than a religious group,

and articles authored by him may have had the effect of

rendering NOI officiais vulnerable to robbery efforts,
‘as in the case of RAYMOND SHARRIEF, Supreme Captain,

Fruit of Islam, Februdry 4,-1969, The continuing use of
Reporter is being considered,

Chicago has also continued to advise local
authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists,
particularly BPP members, appear vulnerable to arrest
on local charges, Along these lines Chicago letter of
February 10; 1969, set forth specific mformation whereby
FRED HAMPTON, local BPP officer, was arrested just prior
to a television appearance, through efforts of a Chicago
BPP source and Chicago Special Agents. The arrest was an
effective source of embarrassment to the BPP; however,
HAMPTON was subsequently found innocent, in jury trial,
of the mob action charges for which he had been arrested.

Additionally, information has regularly been
disseminated by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local
dissemination in instances where Chicago BPP subjects have
travelled elsewhere. Specifically local BPP subjects have
on several occasions journeyed to the.University of
Illinois, Champaign, Illinois, and their activities there
have resulted in numerous arrests. Prior knowledge of
the presence of these subjects, their purposes and
‘identities, have been of great value in alerting local
‘authorities to the potential for violence represented,

a Qne of those local BPP members arrested in
Springfield was determined to be on probation on local
Chicago charges, Inasmuch as the arrest represented a
violation of this probation, the information regarding
the arrest was made available to the appropriate Chicago
* Police authorities, and probation authorities, Unfortunat
both expressed a lack of interest in taking any action
in this matter.

4, Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

‘As in the recent past, the most significant
area of development continues to center around. the
activities of the local BPP, It has suffered from
organizational and factional problems, as well as
financial difficulties, and has yet to prove its ability
to serve as a cohesive or unifying influence in the
local Black Nationalist community.

. As concerns the remainder of local Black
Nationalist, individuals and groups, the situation
continues to be fragmented, with none appearing of sufficient
stature or influence that the divergent groups are willing
to sacrifice their own limited objectives, or independance,
. for the sake. of a united front,

sane It might be noted at this point that Chicago
continues to regard the local BPP as the focal point for
counterintelligence in this field. The letter of June 17,
1969, requests Bureau authority to attempt to publicize
cartoon depictions of the BPP in a subservient position
to the SDS. 7

Within recent weeks a relatively small, but highly
vocal group of young Puerto Ricans has emerged in the
Spanish speaking community, utilizing the name Young Lords,
Essentially a youth or street gang in nature, it has adopted
the pose of a political organization, and an affiliation
with the BPP has arisen. it appears that the real nature
of this group, and those associated with it, are not generally
recognized by the responsible elements in the community,
and the file of this group, and of those persons in and
associated with it, are being reviewed with the end of
developing a suitable counterintelligence program. .A .
recommendation will be provided the Bureau in the event an
effective action can be formulated.
2. & 3. Operations being Effected and Tangible Results ~
Obtained

Chicago at present has in effect the program
authorized by the Bureau May 21, 1969, to instruct selected
BPP informants for use in creating a rift. between the
BPP and SDS. It is as yet to early to determine what, if
any, effect will be forthcoming. This program additionally
has become somewhat complicated by the disruption which has
been created in the BPP locally by the June 4, 1969, raid of
the Chimgo Office on the BPP headquarters, and subsequent
Chicago Police Department arrests of sOme sixteen BPP members,
on a variety of local charges.

This program is being pursued very carefully,
in ‘Light of the Bureau's observations in letter of May 21,
1969. Tangible results iieasien oer obtained will be provided
the Bureau.

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest a

The emergence of the Young Lords has been
previously referred to. Also of interest is the
disruption of the regular and normal functioning

of the BPP, through effective and vigorous enforce~
ment of criminal statutes violated by them on a local
and federal level. Most recent information from BPP
sources reflects the organization to be purging its
ranks, in an effort to weed out infiltrators; also
reflects that there may be beginning to emerge in lower
levels of BPP ranks a dissatisfaction with the current
leadership, This situation will be followed closely
and where a counterintelligence avenue appears to offer
itself, a suitable recommendation will be forthcoming.

No counterintelligence action will be taken |
by Chicago without Bureau approval.

In recent weeks 2 highly vocal group of young
Puerto Ricans calling themselves the Young Lords have
undertaken action in the north side Puerto Rican neighborhood.
This group is basically a.youth gang, however, they have become
active in neighborhood matters particularly urban renewal
problems for the area. Information available concerning the
Young Lords and its leader's is being reviewed with the end
in tind of the possibility of developing a suitable counter-
intelligence program concerning this group. When and if a
suitable recommendation is developed, such will be provided
to the Bureau in the event an effective action can be
formulated. :

2 and 3. OPERATIONS BEING EFFECTED AND TANGIBLE
RESULTS OBTAINED

Chicago at present has in effect the program
authorized by the Bureau July 31, 1969, to mail copies
of cartoons prepared to further efforts to create a rift
between the BPP and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).
It is, as yet, too early to determine what, if any, effect
will be forthcoming.

This program is being pursued very carefully, in
light of the Bureau's observations in letter of July 31, 1969.
Any tangible results subsequently obtained will be provided
the Bureau. 7

‘ 4 DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INTEREST

The recent statement of DAVID HILLIARD, BPP, Chief
of Staff, that the BPP will take action against SDS if they
make “one more counter-revolutionary statement” would appear
to indicate a widening of a rift between the “BPP and SDS.

-This situation will be followed closely and where a

counterintelligence effort would appear to have reasonably
tangible potential, a suitable recommendation will be
submitted.

No counterintelligence action will be taken by
Chicago without Bureau approval.

exhaustively reviewed to this end. The possibility has been

“Chicago is continuing to give the matter’ ‘of discrediting
GREGORY top priority, and Bureau authority will be promptly

noted, however, as in Chicago airtel of May 21, 1968, that

imminent induction into the Armed Forces,

Although not a counterintelligence measure as. such,

Chicago has vigorously followed and pursued this situation,
both with Selective Service and the Office of the United States
Attorney. Recently BROWN refused to be inducted, his file is
in.the process of being forwarded by Selective Service to the
United States Attorney (USA), who has advised BROWN's case
will be brought before the Federal Grand “Jury at the earliest
possible moment. The USA has advised that a warrant for the

further inhibit local SNCC activities, and hopefully, would
in some measure serve to neutralize BROWN himself.

Chicago also feels that the Chicago Firearms
Registration Ordinance, which went into effect May 15, 1968,
has definite potential as a counterintelligence device, to be
directed against local militants, as for example RUSS. MEEK,
MEEK is known to have purchased 13 diffeent firearms since January,
1967, and it would appear highly unlikely these guns, if still
in his possession, have been registered. In addition to the
Chicago ordinance, a state law which requires registration of
all persons possessing firearms will go into effect September 1,
1968, The penalty for violation.of the local ordinance is a
$500 fine. for violation of ae state are a $1, 000 fine and a
year incarceration.

Contact with ‘the local’ ‘office of gun | registration has
reflected that it will be approximately another 45-60 days before
records are organized and alphabétized. MEEK is identified as
.a possible target in this regard, however, there would appear to
be a number: *6£ militants who may well be sane apace

As ‘the Bureau has cautioned, Chicago assures that
each specific future counterintelligence operation will be
pepe for.Bureau approval prior to taking any action.

2. Operations Being Effected

Chicago at present has no counterintelligence operat ion
in progress, however, aS noted will develop such, directed
toward HERBERT MOHAMMED, upon receipt of his tax returns from
the Bureau.

The impetus being provided to the efforts to expedite
the handling of ROBERT BROWN's Selective Service case is not a
counterintelligence operation in the normal sense of the term,
arising as it does from a substantive violation of federal
jaw. However, the end result, that of reducing the effectiveness
and hampering the activities of BROWN, is tantamount to that

shich might be achieved through any such operation » with BROWN
48 its target.

1. Operations Under Consideration

a Subsequent to the above referenced Chicago
communication, this office has had several counterintelligence
operations under consideration. A review of the income

| tax returns of HERBERT MOHAMMED, one of the heads of the

Nation of Islam (NOI), has been completed, HERBERT MOHAMMED 4
having been earlier designated by Chicago as a primary »y
counterintelligence target. It was determined, however, ia
through this review that this individual appears to have
submitted accurate income tax returns for the past several

years and the anticipated counterintelligence approach on

this basis was judged to be inappropriate.

Several additional counterintelligence approaches
to the NOI have subsequently be considered, in reference to
NOI units in San Antonio and Phoenix; however, for reasons
set forth in Chicago communications of October 4, 1968 and
October 16, 1968, under the above caption, such activities
as considered were deemed to be inadvisable.

In relation to.the NOI specifically, Chicago

continually monitors closely the activities of this
group with the end in view of developing effective
counterintelligence techniques directed at either the organization
or its leadership. in the event an cpportunity .arises where
2 productive counterintelligence measure appears in
order, Chicago will immediately submit specifics of such
approach for the Bureau's approval.

Reference has been made in the above referred to.

Chicago communication to the state and local Gun Ownership
and Registration Ordinanceswhich appear to render such
possession or ownership on the part of black nationalists

- 2 vulnerable area in the event information exists that they
are in possession of firearms illegally. Chicago is in
the process of initiating a file review concerning such
selected cases, the results of this review to be utilized
in a close check of the records of both sate and local law a
enforcement and reguiatory agencies, The records of these
agencies have only just recently been determined as having been
placed in order for an effective review along these lines to
be made,

Many of these militants are known in the past to have
been in possession of weapons and where information can be
developed reflecting that they are currently in possession
of firearms, “or are suspected of being in possession of Zire-
arms, appropriate liaison will be exploited to utilize these
statutes to the extent possible against the militants in
question. Such a program will be submitted to the
Bureau for approval, prior to any specific such action being
taken by Chicago,

a

th)



ce 157-2209 Seeeescenee? =

eee ' Chicago continues to a follow the activities
of ROBERT BROWN, referred to in referenced letter of
July 2, 1968, as a primary counterintelligence target. He
was recently turned down for military service and
consequently will continue to be active locally. He is the
former head of the Chicago and Midwest group of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and most recently
has indicated his conversion to or formation of a local
branch of the Black Panther Party, headquartered in Oakland,
California, This is a very recent development and the extent
of the organization of this group in terms of membership and
pessible influence locally is as yet difficult to establish.
[his situation was referred to at some length in a Chicago
communication under the above caption, Octoberl4, 1968, and
the situation is relatively unchanged from that time.

In addition, however, a Chicago racial source
close to BROWN has advised that he has recently expressed a
desire to "take over" the remains of the Chicago Chapter of
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), this group having
been expelled from National CORE in early October, 1968.
This expulsion came about as a result of a September, 1968,
walkout on the part of the Chicago Chapter from the National
CORE Convention held in St. Louis, Missouri.

BROWN and the head of the local CORE group, ROBERT
LUCAS, have never been friendly and BROWN had stated his desire
to remove LUCAS from the leadership of this group and place it
under the Black Panther Party banner, meaning by this under his
own leadershin. To complicate this situation somewhat; however,
this former CORE group, under the leadership of LUCAS, has only
recently organized itself into a new black organization calling
itself Black Liberation Alliance, formed at the national
meeting held over the weekend of October 18-20, 1968, at
Columbus, Ohio. BROWN did not attend this affair and the position
he will take as a resuit of this development is not yet clear,
It is believed, however, that this.situation,

‘
|,NW 55154 DocId:32989639 Page 297__



CG 157-2209
caste i ‘y

due in large measures to the friction among personalities
involved, offers some opportunity for exploitation under a
counterintelligence approach, At present, the situation
appears to be too formative and nebulous for a specific
technique to be intelligently developed.

In short regarding the above situation, within
a@ period of little more than a month, the Chicago CORE
Chapter, together with a rather limited number of adherents in
other cities, has moved from a:CORE group in good standing
to a new and somewhat organized black group. It would appear
that the early stages of the development of this group
would offer a good opportunity to inhibit its effectiveness
and as soon as Chicago can analyze the situation and
develep what appears an effective approach, a specific
recommendation for a counterintelligence action will be
submitted for Bureau approval.

JAHES HARVEY, a male Negro, age 22, the founder
and organizer of the Afro-American Students Association was
also referred to in referenced Chicago letter as a likely aa
counterintelligence target. An analysis of his most recent
activities would reflect that he is at present in a position
where he might well be vulnerable to a well thought out
counterintelligence approach. He has, until very recently,
engaged in no significant local militant activities;
however, within the past month has emerged as a principal
“adult advisor" to several individuals and black youth
groups instrumental in the organization and implementation of
black student boycotts and unrest generally within the Chicago
Public Schcol System. HARVEY operates principally out of
the Umoja (unity) Black Students Center on Cxu:vago's south
Side and appears to have been a substantiai influence on this
movement which has been of Significant success in terms of its
effect on schools in Chicago's ghetto community. In
sonsideration of counterintelligence approaches to HARVEY,

~4e

.

NW 55154 Docld:32989639 Page 298, _



CG 157-2209

—-attention will be devoted to his travel to Czechoslovakia
during 1968, as well as his summer of 1968 travel to Japan
where he reportedly was in contact with communist orientated
Student and youth groups. During 1968 it was also determined
that HARVEY in the past has advised his local draft board of
homosexual activities on his part, which activities have
served as the basis for his exclusion from military service.
It appears possible that the above as well as additional
past activities on his part might well be utilized.in
possibly compremising him and to some extent the black school
boycott movement with which he is to some extent involved.
Again, prior to the inception of any counterintelligence
activities, Chicago will submit a specific recommendation to
the Bureau for its approval,

2. Operations Being Effected

No counterintelligence operations are currently
in progress in this field in Chicago; however, as the
information set forth previously would reflect, Chicago
anticipates that very shortly recommendations to initiate such ..
operations will be forthcoming.

3, Tangible Resuits : 7

No tangible results have as yet been forthcoming
since the inception of this program in the black nationalist
field.

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

Information reflecting on this captioned subject
matter has been referred to in large measure under the first
item above. In short, however, the most significant
developments lecally would appear to be represented in the
expalsion of Chicago CORE from the national group with the
development of a new black nationalist organization involving
these former members of CORE; development-.of ‘4 local ‘Chapter of the Blac
Panther Party and a possible rivalry between this group and
the leader of the new black organization referred to previously;

counterintelligence approach locally are consequently being
directed at thése areas of development.

The Chicago black nationalist scene generally
continues to be a fragmented one, characterized by a number
of small and relatively ineffective groups and individuais,
none of whom have indicated a willingness or ability to
work together or to polarize these to some extent competitive
groups into 2 united front-type organization or grouping. Chicago
feels that through an effective and well thought out counter-
intelligence approach, it may-be possible to develop programs
which will in some measure contribute to the
continuation of this. situation and prevent the emergence on
locally of a group or individual who may serve as a unifying
force within the black nationalist grouping. Chicago will
remain continually alert to explore and exploit every avenue
for possible counterintelligence activities directed at the
black nationalist field which appears to hold potential for ~~”
accomplishing this end. Any such development or technique
will be immediately made available to the Bureau for its
consideration and approval prior to inception by Chicago.

1) Operations Under Consideration

1 On a continuing basis Chicago is in the process of
analyzing and considering the constantly changing iocal

Black Nationalist situation from the viewpoint of the
development of an effective counterintelligence program.

At the present time emphasis is being placed upon the develop-
ing Black Panther Party (BPP) group which has only recently
opened offices on Chicago's west side and which is now actively
recruiting and establishing itself as a functional organization.
locally. This situation remains somewhat fluid and as yet
no specific counterintelligence program has been developed
for this reason.

AS an example, in the initial stages here of the
establishment of the BPP group there was conflict between
rival factions, one recognized by the parent organization in
Oakland, California, the other unsanctioned. The rivalry
between such militantly orientated persons briefly threatened
to erupt into physical confrontation on several occasions,
however, before this situation could be exploited the problem
was resolved and the group merged under the leadership of
ROBERT BROWN, former #6cal leader of t.@ Student Non Voilent
Coordinating Committess The personalities which have sub-
sequently emerged as ominant within the Bey; locally are, in
addition to BROWN, ROBERT RUSH, FRED HAMPTi., Maywood, Illinois,

“on the BPP, anticipates the submission of such communication
on or prior to December 16, 1968,

By letter November 22, 1968, Chicago submitted specific
counter intelligence recommendations concerning JAMES HARVEY,
local Black Nationalist personality, who has most recently
been an influential advisor -to young black students in Chicago
who have been involved in student boycotts on the high school
level, No response as yet has been forthcoming and Chicago
will take no action regarding the recommendations submitted
without prior Bureau approval, Chicago is continuing to attempt
to isolate instances regarding local Black Nationalists who
have been in possession of firearms in the past and who appear
to possibly be in violation of local and state firearms 5
provisions. It is anticipated that such a review will be
completed shortly and where appropriate, communication will
be submitted to the Bureau with specific recommendations
contained therein, It appears in some instances. however, that
action in this regard may be taken locally which is not purely
counter intelligence in nature, co

An example of such was the recent instance where in
connection with a review of background information concerning
JEFF FORT, local leader of the Blackstone Rangers, south side
Chicago Negro gang it was determined that a warrant was out-
standing for FORT for failure to pay a fine of $50,00 on a
disorderly conduct conviction, In conversation with the
personnel of the Chicago Police Department, Gang Intelligence
Unit, this information was made available and it was agreed
that if an arrest warrant for FORT was executed at his residence,
a search could then be made of the premises and contraband
such as firearms or narcotics might possibly be located,

This was in fact done, as set forth in Chicago airtel
and letterhead memorandum of December 9, 1968, under the
caption JEFF FORT, Contempt of Congress, Miscellaneous -
Information Concerning. When the arrest warrant was served on
FORT a search was made by Police Department representatives
of the premises at his residence and a .22 caliber four shot

_derringer pistol was located. As a result FORT was subsequently

charged with having an unregistered weapon in his possession
as well as Unlawful Use of a Weapon. He is scheduled to appear

in court on December 18, 1968, to answer to these charges.
_It might.also be noted in passing that Chicago continues to
“naintain periodic contact-with Federal District Court Judge
JAMES PARSONS approved by the Bureau for counterintelligence
usage Sometime ago, but primarily against the NOI. These
contacts have been amplified recently by virtue primarily of
changing times and events to embrace the Black Nationalist
field generally. The contacts with PARSONS, informal in nature,
are considered to have been directly responsible for recent
statements by him, widely reported in the Chicago press
media, critical of gang influences in the Ghetto as well as
Black Nationalist groups, the latter described by him as
"glib exploiters of disenfranchised people."

It is felt PARSONS will certainly continue to speak
out in such fashion and the contact by Chicago productive
of such will continue.

" In referenced Chicage letter reference was made to a

possible friction between ROBERT BROWN, above, and ROBERT
. LUCAS, the latter the National head of the newly formed Black
Liberation Alliance (BLA). Since referenced letter no significant
developments have taken place in this regard and no further
information has been developed reflecting any interest on the

part of BROWN in this group. The BLA holds regular meetings,
however, to date less than 10 individuals have actually joined

the organization, its activities limited almost exclusively to
these meetings and to such activities as literature distribution.
At the present time BLA appears to be floundering and to have

no real or apparent support within the Negro community or from
Black Nationalists in particular. It is felt a counterintelligence
interest at this time in the BLA is not warranted.

2) Operations Being Effected

Reference has previously been made to the periodic
contact with Judge PARSONS to this end. It has also been
noted that Chicago is awaiting Bureau authority to implement
a counterintelligence program against JAMES HARVEY. Recom-
mendations regarding HARVEY were submitted on November 22, 1968.



CG 157-2209 Be ete , :
Chicago also will continue to selectively advise

local authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists

appear’vulnerable to arrest on local charges, in instances

where such information is either not available or apparent

to them. This is in reference to such instances as that set

forth previously involving JEFF FORT. ;

3) Tangible Results 7 : : ;
In this regard, the remarks of Judge PARSONS, alluded

to previously and the arrest of FORT both appear as tangible

results of Chicago counterintelligence activity.

4) Developments of Counterintelligence Interest Ts

“ The principal development locally, subsequent to
referenced letter, would appear to be the emergence of the
BPP Chapter referred to previously under the leadership of
ROBERT BROWN and his associates. The question of the ability
of this group to provide a unifying and polarizing influence
within the local Black Naticnalist community remains to be
seen. Chicago will very closely follow the development and
activities of this group, through knowledgeable BPP sources,
and will submit counterintelligence suggestions in the bi-monthly
letter requested by the Bureau as instructed.

“Set forth hereinafter is the periodic progress
letter concerning captioned matter, as directed in Bureau
airtel March 4, 1968, under the captgons as instructed:

1. Operations Under Consideration

Since the above referenced letter, Chicago has
continued to closely follow local developments in the Black
Nationalist field, with the development of effective counter~
intelligence techniques constantly in mind. Although all
facets of Black Nationalist activities and groups are so
considered, the local Black Panther Party (BPP) chapter and
its activities continue to receive particular attention, This
is due to the admittedly violent and militant nature of the
BPP, aswell as the volatile nature of the individuals who
compose both its leadership and membership.

Chicago is under Bureau instructions to submit on ©

a two-"eek basis a counterintelligence proposal regarding
the BPP, and since referenced letter a-number of specific
proposals have been submitted and approved. Chicago has
prepared and mailed four separate anonymous communications, °
‘concerning JAMES PHILIP HARVEY (approved Bureau letter
December 10, 1968), JEFF FORT (approved Bureau letter

+ anid reported on their recent annual convention, and was

the object of an attempt by an official of the NOI to
force upon him $1000 as a token of NOI appreciation of
articles relative to the organization. The purpose of
our previous contacts with JONES in this connection was
to provide him with background information relative to
the non-religious aspects of the NOI, its business

- ventures and financial dealings.

At the NOI -convention, and subsequent thereto,
NOI officials have made statements critical of MALCOLM X,
describing him as an example, as one of "the worst enemies"
of the Muslims, meaning by inference black people. A
story regarding these attacks on MALCOLM at the convention
was’ authored by JONES, and subsequently appeared in the
"Tribune", A highly placed Chicago source in the NOI,
namely CG 6896-S, has since advised that the NOI attacks
on MALCOLM have generally produced unfavorable results
within the Negro community on the south side, particuhk rly ~
Since the NOI in many quarters is still regardedas responsibie
for the death of MALCOLM.

Accordingly, Chicago geil shortly submit, by
separate communication,Bureau authority to recontact
JONES relative to possibilities of further exploiting
the- NOI attacks on MALCOLM, directed at further reflecting
unfavorable reaction toward the NOI, .*

At present Chicago has no further specific
counterintelligence proposals under consideration. Another
letter regarding the BPP, however, is due for submission
March 24, 1969.

2. Operations Being Effected and
Tangible Results Obtained

Reference has previously been made to the
specific counterintelligence actions initiated by
Chicago, As yet no information has been received by
Chicago reflecting tangible results of these actions.

.



cG 157-2209.

A detailed analysis of the use of WILLIAM

JONES was set forth in Chicago airtel of February 17,
1969. . In short, it was noted that the NOI was shown
publicly as more of a business than a religious group,
and articles authored by him may have had the effect of
rendering NOI officials vulnerable to robbery efforts,
as in the case of RAYMOND SHARRIEF, Supreme Captain,
Fruit of Islam, Februdry 4,-1969, The continuing use of
- JONES is being considered, ..

Chicago has also continued to advise local
authorities of instances where local Black Nationalists,
particularly BPP members, appear vulnerable to arrest
on local charges, Along these lines Chicago letter of
February 10, 1969, set forth specific information whereby 2
FRED HAMPTON, local BPP officer, was arrested just prior
to a television appearance, through efforts of a Chicago
BPP source and Chicago Special Agents, The arrest was an
effective source of embarrassment to the BPP; however,
HAMPTON was subsequently found innocent, in jury trial,
of the mob action charges for which he had been arrested.

Additionally, information has regularly been
disseminated by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local
dissemination in instancés where Chicago BPP subjects have
travelled elsewhere. Specifically local BPP subjects have
on several occasions journeyed to the.University of
Illinois, Champaign, Illinois, and their activities there :
have resulted in numerous arrests. Prior knowledge of
the presence of these subjects, their purposes and
identities, have been of great value in alerting local
authorities to the potential for violence represented,

Fi One of those local BPP members arrested in
Springfield was determined to be on probation on local
Chicago charges. Inasmuch as the arrest represented a
violation of this probation, the information regarding

the arrest was made available to the appropriate Chicago
Police authorities, and probation authorities, Unfortunately,
both expressed a lack of interest in taking any action

in this matter,

4, Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

sAs in the recent past, the most significant
area of development continues to center around the
activities of the local BPP, It has suffered from
organizational and factional problems, as well as
financial difficulties, and has yet to prove its ability
to serve as a cohesive or unifying influence in the

_ local Black Nationalist community.

As concerns the remainder of local Black
Nationalist, individuals and groups, the situation
continues to be fragmented, with none appearing of sufficien:
stature or influence that the divergent groups are willing
to sacrifice their own limited objectives, or independance,
for the sake of a united front.

It might be noted at this point that Chicago
ian -evritinues to regard the local BPP as the focal point for
counterintelligence in this field. The letter of June 17,
1969, requests Bureau authority to attempt to publicize
cartoon depictions of the BPP in a subservient position
to the SDS.

Within recent weeks a relatively small, but highly
vocal group of young Puerto Ricans has emerged in the
Spanish speaking community, utilizing the name Young Lords.
Essentially a youth or street gang in nature, it has adopted
the pose of a political organization, and an affiliation
with the BPP has arisen. It appears that the real nature
of this group, and those associated with it, are not generally
recognized by the responsible elements in the community,
and the file of this group, and of those persons in and
associated with it, are being reviewed with the end of
developing a suitable counterintelligence program, A
recommendation will be provided the Bureau in the event an
effective action can be formulated.

2. & 3, Operations being Effected and Tangible Results cd
Obtained

Chicago at present has in effect the program
authorized by the Bureau May 21, 1969, to instruct selected
BPP informants for use in creating a rift. between the
BPP and SDS. It is as yet to early to determine what, if
any, effect will be forthcoming. This program additionally
has become somewhat complicated by the disruption which has
been created in the BPP locally by the June 4, 1969, raid of
the Chimgo Office on the BPP headquarters, and subsequent
Chicago Police Department arrests of sOme sixteen BPP members,
on a variety of local charges.

ee,

This program is being pursued very carefully,
in “Light of the Bureau's observations in letter of May 21,
1969. Tangible results subsequently obtained will be provided
the Bureau.

CG 157-2209

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

The emergence of the Young Lords has been
previously referred to, Also of interest is the
disruption of the regular and normal functioning

of the BPP, through effective and vigorous enforce-
ment of criminal statutes violated by them on a local
and federal level. Most recent information from BPP
sources reflects the organization to be purging its
ranks, in an effort to weed out infiltrators; also
reflects that there may be beginning to emerge in lower
levels of BPP ranks a dissatisfaction with the current
leadership. This situation will be followed closely
and where a counterintelligence avenue appears to offer
itself, a suitable recommendation will be forthcoming.

No counterintelligence action will be taken
by Chicago without Bureau approval,

Reference has previously been made to the
specific counterintelligence actions initiated by
Chicago, No information has been received reflecting
tangible results of these actions,

Chicago has also continued to advise local

authorities of instances where BPP members appear ,

vulnerable to arrest on local charges.

Information has regularly been disseminated
by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local .dis=

semination in instances where Chicago BPP members have

travelled elsewhere. Prior knowledge of the presence
of BPP niembers in their areas has been of value in
alerting local authorities to the potential for
violence that their presence represents.

IV. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

There are no current developments concerning
the Chicago Branch of the BPP, which would appear to
have reasonable potential for counterintelligence
activity.

Regarding the remainder of local Black
Nationalist groups and individuals, their activities
are fragmented and timited. Chicago continues to
follow such activities in the event information is
developed which would indicate a counterintelligence
effort would appear to have reasonable potential.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN
@emocratic Convention 1968)

The Sullivan memorandum to John Dean under Part 4
captioned "Re: Democratic Convention 1968" contained the
following: 7 :

"John Criswell, National Treasurer, Democratic

Party called the FBI and said he had dinner

with Marvin Watson, Postmaster General and

Watson had toid him of the great services

performed by the FBI during the last

Democratic Convention in Atlantic City,

New Jersey. He asked if the same services

eould be performed at the Democratic

Convention in Chicago. Some assistance

was given by the Chicago FBI Office but it

was not at all of the nature and scope of

the services rendered Johnson at Atlantic City."

The files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

. contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1968, from C, D. De Loach

to Mr. Tolson captioned "Democratic National Convention,
Chicago, Illinois.'' A carbon copy of this memorandum was
designated for Mr. Sullivan. This memorandum states:

services could be performed this time
in Chicago. He also asked if I could
personally go out and take charge, as
was the case in Atlantic City.

I told Criswell that Bill Connell,
Executive Assistant to the Vice President,
had already called regarding this matter,
and had personally discussed the entire |
matter with the Director. I stated the
Director had made complete arrangements
to have a topflight group of experienced
agents, under the supervision of the
Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago”
Office, handle this assignment. I told
Criswell I felt certain these men would
do an excellent job and the Vice President's
office would be kept fully advised at all
times of need-to-know information.

Criswell expressed appreciation
and stated he did not know Connell had
already made the request in question.'"!

Sullivan Memoranda to John Dean

According to this memorandum, Mr. Connell told
Mr. De Loach that the President had, some time ago, advised
the Vice President that the FBI had sent a "special team"
to Atlantic City during the last Democratic National
Convention. The President allegedly told the Vice President
that the FBI had been of great service to him and he had
been given considerable information on a timely basis
throughout the entire convention.

Mr. Connell stated, according to the memorandum,
that while he desired to discuss this with the Director,
the Vice President hoped the Director would. extend to him
the same service during the forthcoming Democratic National
Convention in Chicago.

The memorandum further states that Mr. Connell
was told that, while he desired to discuss this matter
with the Director, he should know that our Chicago Office
is very well prepared to gather intelligence and pass such
intelligence onto appropriate authorities during the
convention. Mr. Connell stated he presumed this to be
true; however, he would call again next week and mention
this matter to the Director, A handwritten notation by
Mr. Hoover at the end of this memorandum stated ''I talked
to Connell. Also I talked Fe SAG, egohyson, and, issued.
appropriate instructions." ene & Ah ctebadudeeeunin

7 A memorandum prepared by Mr. Hoover for Mr. Tolson,
Mr. De Loach, Mr. Bishop, and Mr. Sullivan dated August 15,
1968, reflects that at 10:09 a.m. Mr. Hoover talked to
Mr. William Connell, Executive Assistant to the Vice President.

Mr. Hoover set forth the following information regarding
this conversation:

q "Mr, William Connell, Executive
Assistant to the Vice President, returned
my call. I told him I was out of town
when he called last week and I wanted
to return his call.

Mr. Connell thanked me for
calling and stated what he had called
about was that he had talked to the
Vice President about the team I sent
into the convention area in 1964 that
was so helpful. He stated he was hoping
perhaps I might be able to do the same
thing for the Vice President out in
Chicago and have my men directly in
contact with him (Connell).

I advised Mr. Connell that
I had already initiated that and that
he will be supplied by Special Agent
in Charge Marlin Johnson in Chicago;
tht any*kind oifvass¥Standé ne waits *
to just let Mr. Johnson know and he oe
will take care of it.

Mr. Connell thanked me and
said he will tell the Vice President."

This memorandum also reflects that at 10:13 a.m.
Mr. Hoover talked to SAC Marlin Johnson in Chicago. Mr. Hoover
likewise set forth the results of this conversation:

"I called SAC Marlin Johnson in
Chicago and told him I had just talked to
Mr. William Connell, Executive Assistant
to the Vice President, and what he wanted
to have done was an operation similar to
what we did down at Atlantic City at the
last Democratic Convention when Mr. Johnson
was running for renomination. I explained
that he would like to have us furnish the
same type of information and be in contact .
with him, Connell, on any so-called
intelligence we might get. I stated I
told Mr. Connell we would do that and
that SAC Johnson would be in contact with
Connell and anything he wanted to let
Johnson know. I told Mr. Johnson we are
not going to get into anything political
but anything of extreme action or violence
contemplated we want to let Connell know.

Sullivan Memoranda to John Dean

Illinois, on August 26, 1968, offered the most potential
platform for disruptive activities by racial and Viet Nam
dissident groups, similar instructions were set forth for
both the Miami Office in connection with the Republican
National Convention (August 5-10, -1968) and for the
Chicago Office in connection with the Democratic National
Convention (convening August 26, 1968).

These instructions stated that we had the
responsibility to keep high government officials and
other interested agencies advised of developments in
regard to disruptive activities and that it would be
necessary for each field division of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation to be acutely and continually aware of
developing situations. All offices were instructed
to take the necessary steps to insure that we were
receiving all information available concerning plans
being made to carry on protest demonstrations at the
conventions or to otherwise carry on any disruptive
activities. S

The Federal Bureau of Investigation took the
initiative in planning for possible disruptions and
violence during the two national conventiotis, In addition

law enforcement agencies and Secret Service, we also
had the responsibility to develop violations of Federal
laws within our jurisdiction that might occur during
the conventions. Such laws as the Federal Anti-Riot Laws,
Assaulting a Federal Officer stetute, Kidnapping statute,
bombing and gun law violations, Presidential and Congressional

Sullivan Memoranda to John Dean

Assassination statute, and Crime Aboard Aircraft violations
all come within the investigative responsibility of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

We closely coordinated our activities regarding
the conventions with Federal and state agencies which
had the responsibility to keep the peace and protect
life and property. We disseminated all pertinent
information developed through on-the-scene observations,
pertinent investigation, and through informant coverage
to the appropriate agencies having an interest in the
conventions.

No technical surveillances were utilized in
connection with the Republican Convention in Miami Beach
in 1968 or the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968.

In connection with the Chicago Convention
because of the advanced information developed that
disruptive activities were to occur, we requested
Attorney General authority for the installation of
technical coverage of the Mobilization Office for
Demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention.
This authorization was requested by our memorandum to

» Fhe Atgorney General dated March 11, 1968. By memorandum
arch 12, 1968, Attorney General Ramsey Clark declined

authorization for this requested instaliation. By
memorandum for the Attorney General dated March 22,

March 24, and June 7, 1968, we renewed our previous
request; however, we received no reply. The net result
was that we did not have technical coverage in connéction
with either the Democratic or Republican Conventions

in 1968. ,

In his March 12, 1968, memorandum declining
authority for a telephonic surveillance in connection
with the anticipated demonstrations, Mr, Clark stated "other
investigative activities should be undertaken to provide
intelligence necessary to the protection of the national
interest."

Although extensive plans were made and instructions
issued from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters
in Washington regarding our coverage of these 1968 conventions,
there were no Federal Bureau of Investigation officials on
the scene at either the Republican or Democratic Convention.

In connection with the 1972 Republican and Democratic
National Conventions held in Miami Beach, Florida, similar
coverage was instituted and carried out by the Miami Office
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There, likewise, was
no technical coverage utilized in connection with either the
Republican or Democratic National pouyentions in Miami Beach
in 1972.

No Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters
officials were on the scene at either of these Conventions,
