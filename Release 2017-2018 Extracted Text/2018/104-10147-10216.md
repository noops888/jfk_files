MEMORANDUM FOR :

Mr. Ray Reardon

Office of Security.

FROM

SUBJECT

:

S. D. Breckinridge

: Agency Employees with the Surname of

Bishop

1. The Office of Personnel is gathering files of

present and past employees of the Agency who were on

board in the 60's. Attached are brief excerpts from the

OPFs of the first

group shown to me by Doris Houdesheldt.

2. I am trying to assemble a book of photographs

of these different employees to show to the two witnesses

who think they knew a man named Morris Bishop in the 60's.

The photograph or photographs that you may have concern-

ing the persons listed on the attached pages as near as

possible to the first half of the 60's would be helpful.

3. I expect to have more names in the near future

and will forward those to you as soon as they are

available.

4.

It would be appreciated if you could give this

some priority attention.

S. D. Breckinridge
