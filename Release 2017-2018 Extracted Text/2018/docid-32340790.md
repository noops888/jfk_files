Re PH airtel 6/26/59.

Re airtel Indicates Paul Rennard is a CI currently

furnishing information and that he was previously instructed

by employer to clear with him before furnishing information

to law enforcement.

It is noted also that Rennard has, in

past expressed concern that he would be in danger of losing

his job in event his identity as source became known.

While it is not known how or where the Department

obtained the name of Rennard it is apparent that the

Department 1s giving consideration to using him as a witness.

which would permit Rennard to consent to the dissemination

to the Department the contents of the letterhead memo dated

6/25/59 reflecting the interview of January 3, 1958.
