Remylet 2/17/64 to Bureau; Bulet 3/9/64 denying

Miami authority to designate ALPIZAR as PSI and instructins

hat no steps be taken to guide or control his activities.

It is to be recalled that ALPIZAR furnished accur-

ate information to this office which enabled U.S. Customs

and U.5. Coast Guard to seize a plane, two boats anc ex-

plosives on 12/28/63, thereby preventing an air bombing raid

from being launched agains: Cuba.- This raid was promoted

by the Movimiento Insurrecional de Revolucionario Recuperacion

(MIRR), an anti-Castro organization led by DI. ORLANDO BOSCH

AVILA, who has

a history of having previously sponsored

bombing raids.

In 1/64 BOSCH disclosed to ALPIZAR that he planned

another raid.

ALPIZAR hes been volunteering info to this

office concering these plans which have encountered setbacks

due to financial problens:

On 3/25,26/64, ALPIZAR voluntarily advised that

BOSCH claims to have recently received considerable funds and

now is seriously laying plans for another raid.

BOSCH has

disclosed that he and the MINI now ace cooperating wich

Comandos I, another anti-Castro action group which, it is

recalled,

made a successful attack against a Russian freighter

In calbasien harbor, Cuba, in Spring, 1963.

BOSCH is depending upon ALPIZAR to assiot him in

carrying out these new plans. He again desires ALPIZAR to

serve as the plane pilot, and to assist BOSCH and another

Cuba, LAREDO RODRIGUEZ, in transporting arms and explosives

co Andros Island in the Bahamas for concealment. BOSCH

plans to set up a base on Andros Island for his boat and the

plane, neither of which has yet been acquired. He desires

ALPIZAR to handle the problem of obtaining an Aero-Commander

plane.

BOSCH has told ALPIZAR he plans to use the boat in

attacking a Russian vessel off the coast of Florida, and the

plane for bombing sugar centrals in Cuba.

BOSCH told ALPIZAR he has decided not to deal wich

any Americans, such as WILLiAM JOHNSON and CHARLES BUSCH,

boch of whom were involved in preparations for the 14/28/63

raid. BOSCH has indicated complete confidence in ALPIZAR, who

has been very adroit in avoiding suspicion.

ALPIZAR also has learned from BOSCH that the

Comandos I group is planning an independent raid against

Cuba by boat in the innediate future. ALPIZAR stands a good

chance of obtaining more info about this by continuing his

association with BOSCH.

Miami has advised U.S. Customs about the above

developments pertaining to raids, and is in process of pre-

paring a communication for the Bureau suicable for

disseminacion.)

risk.

ALPIZAR doubts the value of any such raid as planned

by BOSCH. He also has confidence in the FBI

and believes

it is his duty to cooperate.

In order for ALPIZAR to acquire this information

he has' to associate with BOSCH at the expense of neglecting

his personal affairs. He is in the business of repairing

air conditioners and other electrical equipment.

He also

gives private flying lessons. He has gotten behind in some

of his expenses, and

faces loss of his telephone service.

He wind be unable to continue close association with BOSCH

at this critical time unless he can be compensated for his

loss of time.

This office, to date, has paid him a total of

$350.00 out of a total $400.00

authorized by the Bureau.

An additional $50.00 will be paid to him 3/27/64, which will

exhaust the current authorization.

Alpizar already has proved his productivity and

reliability.

His position with BOSCH is unique because of

his qualifications as a pilot and a veteran of previous raids.

It is because of his background as a man of action and ad-

ventures chat i is able to cultivate the confidence of

BOSCH. Miani feels these characteristics should be regarded

as an advantage in assessing him as a PSI.

With regard to ALPIZAR's treatment in the psychi-

atric section of Jackson Menorial Hospital, Miami, in 1959

and again in 1960, it is noted his doctor, MIGUEL A. MORA,

was also his doctor at the time of his confinement,

advised

on 2/11/64 that ALPIZAR has recovered from his previous

state of depression, and is leading a normal life, unlikely

to have a recurrence of his previous state of depression.

IM 134-975

ALPIZAR's excellent cooperction with this office in 1963,

and up to this time, would indicate that he is stable and

reliable.

As the Bureau is aware, the activities of Cuban

revolutionary organizations are frequently spontaneous

usually comnon...to other nationality groups a nd to the

to carzy out only one or two operations, and then cease to

exist.

Consequently, ic is necessary for this office to

act wich dispatch in placing appropriate coverage on a pai-

cicular organization which is planning a raid.

It is felt that Dureau regulations and policy

relative to development of informants and investigation of

these cases should be applied with sufficient fiexibility

to produce maximum results.

It is respectfully requested that Bureau reconsider

Miami letter 2/17/6k to Bureau in light of above develop-

ments, and approve ALPIZAR for development as a PSI.

It is also respedully requested the Bureau author-

ize this office to pay ALPIZAR up co an additional $200.00

for services rendered on a C.O.D. basis.

It is requested Bureau advise concerning its

decision promptly.
