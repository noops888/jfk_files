BOSCH is depending upon ALPIZAR to assist him i
carrying out these new plans. He again desires ALPIZAR to
serve 4s the plane pilot, and to assist ROSCH and another.
Cuba, LAREDO RODRIGUEZ, in transporting arms and explosives
‘so Andros Island in the Bahamas for concealment, BOSCH ~
\plans to set up a base on Andros Island for his boat and the
plane, neither of which has yet been acquired, He desires
/ALPIZAR to handle the problem of obtaining an Aero-Commander
‘plane,

BOSCH has told ALPIZAR he plans to use the boat in
attacking a Russian vessel off the coast of Florida, and the
plane for bombing sugar centrals in Cuba.

BOSCH told ALPIZAR he has decided not to deal with
any Americans, such as WILLIAM JOHNSON and CHARLES BUSCH,
both of whom were involved in preparations for the 12/28/63
raid, BOSCH has indicated complete confidence in ALPIZAR, whe
has been very adroit in avoiding suspicion.

ALPIZAR also has learned from 30SCH that the
Comandos L group is planning an independent raid against
Cuba by boat in the immediate future, ALPIZAR stands a good -
chance of obtaining mare info about this by continuing his
association with BOSCH.

(Miami has advised U.S. Customs about the above _
developments pertaining to raids, and is in process of pre-.
paring a munication for the Bur eau suitable for
dissemination.) :

ALPIZAR believes that BOSCH is interested in pro- |
e raids primarily for the purpose of raising eee
CH plans the raids,-:ut does not share any personal

visk, ALPIZAR doubts the value of any such raid as planned
by BOSCH. He also has confidence in the FBI and believes
it is his duty to cooperate,

In order for ALPTIZAR to acquire this information
he has’ to associate with BOSCH at the expense of neglecting
his personal a¥fairs, He is in the business of repairing
air conditioners and other electrical equipment. He also
gives private flying lessons. He has gotten behind in some
of his expenses, and faces loss of his telephone service,
He will be unable to continue close association with BOSCH
at this critical time unless he can be compensated for his
loss of time.

This office, to date, has paid him a total of |
$350.00 out of a total $400.00 authorized by the Bureau. f
‘An additional $50.00 will be paid to him 3/27/64, which will
exhaust the current authorization.

Alpizar already has proved his productivity and
reliability. His position with BOSCH is unique because of
his qualifications as a pilot and a veteran of previous raids.
It is because of his background es a man of action and ad-
ventures that is is able to cultivate the confidence of
BOSCH, .Miami feels these characteristics should be regarded

} as an advantage in assessing him «s a PSI, :

H With regard to ALPIZAR's treatment in the psychi-
atric section of Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, in 1959
and again in 1960, it is noted his doctor, MIGUEL A. MORA, «so
was also his doctor at the time of his confinement, adviscd

j on 2/11/64 that ALPIZAR has recovered from his previous

state of depression, and is leading a normal life, unlikely
to have a recurrence of his previous state of depression.

ALPIZAK's excellent cooperction with this office in 1963,
and up to this time, would Tie that he is stable and
reliable.

: As the Bureau is aware, the activities of Cuban
revolutionary organizations are trequently spontancous
“and unpredictable. They do not follow the set pattern
usually common to other nationality groups a nd to the ~
Comminist Party. A Cuban vevolutionary group may be formed
to carry out only one or two operations, and then cease to
exist. Consequently, it is necessary for this office to ~
“act with dispatch in placing appropriate coverage on a par~ -
ticular organization which is planning @ raid.

: It is felt that Buréau regulations and policy
relative to development of informants and investigation of
these cases should be applied with ieictalaadiad flex ibility
to Peedece maximum results. -

e te is respectfully requested that Bureau reconsid
Miami letter 2/17/64 to Buxveau in Light of above develop-
ments , and pep re ve ALPILA., for development as a Pst.

’ -it is also respectfully requested ‘the Bureau author- |
ize this office to pay ALPIZAR up co an additional $200. 00 - !
for services rendered on a C, 0. D. basis. j
