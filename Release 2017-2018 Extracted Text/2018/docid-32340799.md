However, SALVATORE PROVENZANO is apparently not a member of
the Cosa Nostra while. SALVATORE BRIGUGLIO is.

On 12/9/64, informant stated that GENE CATENA
has issued instructions to all members of his. family. who
had anything to do with IBT matters to cooperate fully
with ANTHONY PROVENZANO, Informant further advised that
PROVENZANO was very upset with JAMES R, HOFFA, the International
President of IBT, because HOFFA.did not give him any support
during the trial and attended no teamster's functions in
New Jersey since PROVENZANO's conviction.

On 1/27/65, informant stated that GENE CATENA
instructed PROVENZANO to send out an order directing all
IBT Locals in New Jersey to leave all union organizing in
Port Newark to the International Longshoremen's Association
(ILA). In addition, PROVENZANO assured CATENA that the ILA
is welcome to organize any company in the Port Newark area
that is currently represented by the IBT,

On 2/8/65, informant ‘advised that GERARDO CATENA
met with PROVENZANO a few days before that date. PROVENZANO
had apparently issued two conflicting IBT charters, one of
which was to ROSARIO MOGAVERO, a close friend of CATENA.
At this meeting CATENA made it plain to PROVENZANO that
MOGAVERO was not to be harmed financially in any way.
