PROVENZANO stated that if CASTELLITO was

successfully done away with, the individuals involved

would share in a quarter of a million dollars which would

be obtained from labor contracts.

In addition, he

promised

BRIGUGLIO a business agent's job in Local 560.

Nothing was done in the matter for several months,

according

to the informant; and PROVENZANO called another

meeting in his office at which he told those individuals:

that his trial in the DORN matter was coming, up and the

contract should be handled before the triat started.

According to the informant, the first attempt

to kill CASTELLITO at his home did not succeed because

CASTELLITO's wife and children were in the house at that

The informant stated that a short time later,

CASTELLITO was lured to his sonner home In Upstate Newayork

where he was finally choked

to death by BRIGUGLIO and

CINNO.

1965, NK T-1 further advised that

the driver of the murder car when WAlTER

GLOCKER was shot to death in Hoboken, New Jersey, on May 24,

1963•

Informant stated that his murder was ordered by

as a witness against him in the DORN case.

PROVENZANO had ordered a "bit" on GEORGE PHILLIPS and also

On RAY CARNEY, but later called off the hits.

It is noted that GLockeR,
