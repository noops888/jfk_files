He said that it had been his understanding that

a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as

The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because

it now believed

it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in

addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

was to taken an unusually spectacular sea shell that would be certain to catch

CASTRO's eye, load it with an explosive triggerato blow when the shell was lifted,

and submerge it in an area where CASTRO often went skin diving."

FITZGERALD explored this idea at several sessions with SAM HARPERN

OCCURRENCE: It was agreed that Harvey was to work towards reaching a stage in the

interrogation of Pedro Roig, the Cuban economic official who defected to Mexico,where

he can be surfaced to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin

American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the

original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food.

This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against

the unarmed people of Cardenas. "The-Cuban-source to story-need not-await your determina-

OCCURRENCE:

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states:

"The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to

a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

isolection, the spect a question concerning assete inside as on optinto cheer's
