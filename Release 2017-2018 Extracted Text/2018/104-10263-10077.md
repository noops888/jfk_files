soong to have hoylige vi che blan.". I believe: that the ::

problem la a more serlors and baale

one. As indicated 1a

paragraph 3 of the present semorindum, Fidel CASTRO biaself

reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the group was plotting

against him and, knowing 1t, enliated its support..: Hence we

cannot rule out the prasibility of provocation.

Assassination,

obvioualy, is a dangerous sane,

not merely to the plotters in

• physical sense,

but to a sponsoring governsent which may

muffer severe political repercunnions at home and abroad if ita

involvement fr. made known.

In

the instant case, the riake of

o*posure of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, whether there in

• provocation

or not.

Considering the individuals who are

involved directly, their contacte with KUARK Officers, and their

reported plan to expose ODYOKE, perminting la the plan could

De bignly embarrassing to MUBARl. (Thia 1n even more the came

now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODENVY and ODURGE,

although

fortunately the tenor of hia complaint was that KURARK had got

Biven adegunte support to the pian.)

The contaet at Paris and the untters affecting

the (Paria) Station. - The recruitment" of Mureen had been the

mubject of

an exchange of cables between Paris and Headquartere

ind of discusions at Headquarters batween wH/C and WE (See

PANL-1071 (IN 66557) and DIS-10955)

The annoying thing in

thim connectior now is tbat ISPINOSA has talked about it te

ODINVY and ODURGE and the danger that, 1f he in indiscreet,

his story about this (and the other atters) could rench some

curdous newspapernan.

(In this connection, It appeare that the
