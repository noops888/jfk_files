SUMMARY

1. During the reporting period the LIANCHOR leftist
writer press service produced 35 individual articles and
serialized political feature articles which were distributed
to 20 newspapers throughout Latin America and are known to
have been published regularly by at least 12 newspapers.
Despite this acceptable production rate, the project has not
achieved the objectives set for it by the Mexico Station and
in the Project Outline.

2. Prior to submission of a project renewal request in
late June, 1968, the Mexico Station will attempt to convert
the LIANCHOR operation into a more effective and politically

“more leftist operation. Four of,six LIANCEOR press service
writers will be dropped and P/A(LINLUCK will be replaced,
hopefully by Identity-1, a respectedlindependent leftist
Mexican editorialist for the prestige center-left daily
"BXCELSIOR", If by the end of June, 1968, the operational

4. Formal Organization of LIANCHOR Press Service:

a. The Reference “A” project proposal reports all
significant incidents ing he development of the
LIANCHOR press service by'(LINLUCK)and the Mexico
tation through the first week of December, 1967, when
ol (LINLUCK)sot about bringing together the candidates for
embership in the cooperative press service. As Head-
quarters will recall the project, involve paying a
salary of U.S. $700 per month + dincher in return for
which he was to persuade a number of leftist and center-
left writers to join together as contributors to the : et
LIANCHOR (Identity-2) press service. The contributing
writers or members of the press service were to agree
to waive fees for a trial period during which the press
service was to develop paying clients among Latin
American newspapers and periodicals.

festivities which Paralyze all Mexicans from 15 December

mid-January. In the latter part of January (LINLUCK) held

t a sober business meeting of the LIANCHOR press”group at

5. The Search for a Replacement for P/A(LINLUCK:

U
a. INLUCK) was formally terminated in the summer
of 1966.” He spent much of his termination bonus on
sending hie family back to France (the wife is French) “{
KY

and setting the family up there in an apartment and plac-
ing his sons in school. Following the termination, INLUC!

was again placed on salary while WOFIRM subsized the

in South America accepted the book but would not send

0|(LINLUCK) his share of the sales, wiich was to be used
to rep&y WOFIRM the cost of publishing the book. in
the late fall of 1967, (LINLUCK) spent six weeks in
Guatemala where he reached agreemonts with the Guate-
malan Defense Minister, Rafael ARRIAGA Bosque, whereby
the Defense Ministry was to pay (LINLUCK U.S. $4,000
for the right to pubiish 10,000%opies of, his first
book. The U.S. $4,000 was to be paid by, LINLUCK to
WOFIRM as partial reimbursement of the costs of pub-
lishing the JMROD book. During the visit to Guatemala,

ole INtucy was told by ARRIAGA and nother Guatemalan

government officials that he could expect a consular
appointment by the summer of 1965.

b. Headquarters and the Mexico Station were agreed
that ag soon as he could organize LIANCHOR and find a
suitable replacement! INLUCK) should be terminated and
leave Mexico, Following the’receipt of the LIANCHOR
project approval in early 1968, the LIANCHOR case officer
told,(LINLUCK) that he was expected to find a replacement
meeting WOFIRM approval and be ready to turn the opera-

ion over to his replacement by the end of March, 1968.
ol(LINLUCK) proposed Identity-4, who had shown the most
intérest in the LIANCHOR press service and had been the
first to submit articles. By accident the case officer
was forced to. listen to an hour's conversation between |
Identity-4 and, INLUCK after Identity-4 came to (LINLUCK's
home, interrupted a meeting between the case officer and
OL(LINLUCR) and the case officer sat trapped in a separate
room uibeknownst to Identity-4. From the conversation
the case officer observed that Identity-4 was actually a
political rightist, believed,(LINLUCK to be an LNHARP
agent, had grandiose plans #3: using’ LNHARP funds to
mushroom LIANCHOR into a continent-wide anti-Communist
movement and was married to a neurotic woman who had
hired a private detective agency to check on her husband's
activities®|(LINLUCR was instructed to quietly ease
Identity-4 out of LIANCHOR, to cease holding group meet-
ings of LIANCHOR writers and to try to prevent further
contact between Identity-4 and other members of LIANCHOR.

c.0|Identity~5 was selected as the next candidate to
replace (LINLUCK)as P/A. Identity-5 was technically,
linguistically,” intellectually and professionally well
qualified to head LIANCHOR. During the period of develop-
ment and assessment of Identity-4 by INLUCK)ltdentity-5
wrote an excellent article on Soviet Intelléctual piracy.
However, Identity-5 proved difficult to contact and
control and turned out to be leading a personal life
which would have detracted seriously from his ability
to administer LIANCHOR 0( INLUCK) was told to keep in
touch with Identity-5, but to look for still another
candidate.

d. In early April ARRIAGA posque’as exiled to Miami,

With the Station's concurrence (LINLUCK went to Guatemala
during Easter to confer with Guatemalan President, Julio
MENDEZ Montenegro, and the new Defense Minister concerno-
ing his own future..) The President said he had not
forgotten (LINLUGK) but would not-be able to give him a

: consular post until the outset of 1969, The President

7 LINLUCK) Involvement in Covert Action Operations Targetted
Against Soviet Poet Yevgeny farch-Apr :

oO
a. In warch (Ln. drafted an open letter to Soviet
poet Yevgenyi YEVTUSHENKO asking the Russian to use his
influence to persuade the Soviet government to-end the
persecution of Soviet intellectuals, artists, writers and

- poets .9| (LINLUCK, managed to obtain the signatures of stu-
dents, professors, actors, dancers, writers and intellec-
tuals for his open letter and then persuaded the publisher
of his books to print thousands of copies, which were
distributed by other assets of the Mexico Station. A
copy of the open letter was published in "EXCELSIOR" on
the day of YEVTUSHENKO's arrival in Mexico for what was
originally billed as a personal trip. Because of the
open letter and critical press coverage of YEVTUSHENKO 's
rude behavior towards the press on arriving at Mexico
City airport, the Russian Embassy called a special press
conference the evening of the day of the poet's arrival.
At the press conference YEVTUSHENKO spoke with outrage
of the open letter, carefully dodging a number of questions
asked by the letter, and chided the signers of the letter
for claiming there was absolute literary freedom in Mexico,
asking how there can be freedom anywhere in the world as
long as there is no freedom in Vietnam, YEVTUSHENKO's
remarks about the open letter left no doubt that he had
come to Mexico as a Soviet propagandist and not as a rebel
poet,

ol
b, Canucd) also produced a handbill quoting the

telegram by SoViet intellectuals to the "Consultative
Conference of Communist Parties" at Budapest, asking for
an end to Soviet persecution of intellectuals in the USSR.
The handbill featured two pen and ink drawings of imprisoned
Soviet poets Sinyavsky and Daniel. He also arranged for
the printing in Spanish of an authoritative study of inci-

‘7 . dents surrounding the Galanskov-Dobrovolsky trial in

ing and distribution were charged to LILISP-X.

c. Via Identity-4 (imu K)passed guidance material
to Mexico's top female poet, Margarita MICHELENA,
‘concerning YEVTUSHENKO. MICHELENA published a series

of professional criticisms of YEVTUSHENKO as a poor” ,
poet and opportunist in the Mexican press. In April, .
immediately following YEVTUSHENKN's departure, a@ con-
densation of the MICHELENA critiques of YEVTUSHENKO were
published in the leftist political illustrated magazine
"IMPACTO" by LILISP-E.

d. Identities 3 and 6 of tne LIANCHOR group 4180
published articles against YEVTUSHENKO in the rightist
daily "EL SOL", but the Station felt the articles were
too vitriolic and unobjective to be a credit to LIANCHOR.
In fact, because of these articles the Station plans to
remove both Identities 3 ana 7 from LIANCHOR; for it is
obvious that both persons have long since lost all traces
of their former leftism and are extreme rightists.

EFFECTIVENESS .

8. Views on LIANCHOR Effectiveness by Owner/Director of
Guatemala Daily "EL INPARCIAL™:

)

a, During rntuck 3) Easter visit to Guatemala City
he was told by the owner of “EL IMPARCIAL" that the 2}
newspaper was only interested in publishing INLUCK's'
articles. The newspaper owner stated that (LINLUCK\was
a well-known personality in Guatemala and also wro’
interestingly. The owner also said that he had pub-
lished one series by Identity-4 because Identity-4 was
a Guatemalan who at one time had been important. However,
the owner pointed out that the other LIANCKOR writers
were unknowns and did not write well. He singled out
Identity-3 as being a "menace to journalism" because much
of what she wrote amounted to libel or slander.

pb. The "EL IMPARCIAL" owner said that he received
the newspapers "EL DIA" of Honduras, "LA PRENSA GRAFICA"
of El Salvador, "LA PRENSA" of Nicaragua, "LA REPUBLICA" .
of Costa Rica, "LA ESTRELLA" of Panama and "ULTIMAS
NOTICIAS" of Caracas and had noted that these newspapers.
all cor epee INLUCK 'g) articles but had not, to his
knowledge, p' b ished articles by any of the other LIANCHOR
writers,

“LIANCHOR, the "BL IMPARCIAL" man told ‘LINLUCK) that he -
could never hope to collect fees for His news service .
until the service became both famous and sought after.
The "EL IMPARCIAL" owner advised (LINLUC to find writers
tter known in Latin America, °'He suggested that if
ol ‘LINLUCR) could not afford to pay his writers fees, he
should “persuade first class writers to contribute to
LIANCHOR purely for the prestige of having their material
published araqund Latin America. =

press group. Of nine persons who belonged to the group
as of 15 January, three subsequently dropped out because
of differences of opinion which developed at group meet=
ings. In addition?l@INLUCK) learaed that persons he had
selected partly because of their leftist records (Iden-
tities 3, 4, 7 and 8) had:long since ceased being leftists

and were prone to submit manuscripts with texts politically
harmful to the image of LIANCHOR. Confused political
thinking and poor writing resulted in rejection of over

20 manuscripts during February-April by (LINLUCK) and the
case officer, Rejection of manuscriptslin turn angered

and insulted some of the writers.

b. The personalities and cbhmracter,,of some of the
writers have presented problems to (LINLUCK in directing
and developing the LIANCHOR group into, a productive unit.
Identities 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 had jo be goaded continually
by (LINLUCK)to turn in manuscripts on assigned themes.
BothgIdent ty-3 and Identity-7 turned out to be emotional
extremists, suffering at times from deep melancholy and
at other times from inexplainable rages which were re-
flected in their writings. As of this writing the Station
feels that the only reliable members of the group are
Identities 6 and 9, who should be kept as members of the
group as long as LIANCHOR is run as a group cooperative
press service. The unreliable but brilliant and versatile
poet/writer/lexicographer Identity~5 should be continued
as a contact of LIANCHOR for occasional emergency use
provided(LINLUCK'S replacement can obtain any cooperation

from Identity-5.0\ In summary the LIANCHOR group composed
of Identities 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 has proved ineffective and
not too productive and the ineffective members should be

replaced. ol

10. Effectiveness of P/A(LINLUC

°

a. The list of articles and features by GINLUCK)
under Separate Cover Attachment "B" is by no means the
measure of the agent's writing and production capability.
After the agent dusted off and mailed out several of his
old article, series in December 1968 the case officer
instructed,(LINLUCK) to reduce his production in ratio to
the manusétipts of other LIANCHOR writers which were
mailed out. The case officer was concerned that LIANCHOR
would appear,to wuveK's)} client newspapers to be primarily

a vehicle for(LINLUCK's)lengthy political essaye in con-
trast to the statement in the LIANCHOR prospectus that
LIANCHOR was a press service combining articles on cultural,
educational, economic and social as well as political topics
by many writers. During the agent's two final months of
service he has been given authorization to write as much
ag be can on the Vietnam issue and other topics for the
purpose of building up his name in Guatemala before he

returns there to enter politics.
v

b. While production of articles was not (Lintuck ‘sl
weak point, his selection and handling of the LIANCHOR
press service writers appears to have been weak. He has
been too long on the fringes of the foreign exile group
in Mexico and his contacts among leftists in Mexico are
no longer significant, In addition, the agent appears to

AE GARD ep,

have gone the way of many former Latin American Communists
in that his theoretical solution to some of the political,
economic and social problems of Latin America can no longer
be termed leftist. ‘

. c. As a penetration of a Communist Party Cintuck
was a singleton. ~ Although as @ former Communist leader
he has had experience in handling people, he has not
had experience in handling sub-agents for WOFIRM. There
was evidence during the reporting period that (ENLUCX)o]
was having real trouble managing his co-workers in
LIANCHOR, However, handicapped by the fact that he was
not paying his co-workers fees or salaries, CINLUCK) 9}
probably did as well as he could in controlling his
co-workers, The real fault lay ir his poor selection
of co-workers.

ll. Effectiveness of LIANCHOR articlesthna Features: in
the Station's opinion thosa articles which(LINLUCK) wrote were
forceful and effective, but too long. ‘fhe articles written by
LINLUCK' 3) co-workers apparently were ineffective to the point
‘that they were not considered worth pu» lishing. e Capriles
newspaper chain of Venezuela apparently felt that LINLUCK so
articles were well worth running, despite the fact that they
had to be published in installments. The leading newspapers
in,each of the Central Américan republics appeared to believe
thdt(LINLucK's articles merited automatic publication. It is
assumed thet(LINLUCK's articles were published regularly in

Bolivia du&lto La Paz-Station assistance. However, because no ol

newspaper felt like paying fees to LIANCHOR or answering LINLUCK
correspondence, it has not been possible to ascertain whether
LIANCHOR articles have been published with any regularity in
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia or Ecuador, It is too much
to ask third country stations to scan the press daily for articl
by seven different people. The Mexi¢g_ ation_h appreciated
the assistance received from the (Cardi aly gautaddeand Guatemala
City) Stations which have been the principal source of the clip-
pings of, LINLUCK's )LIANCHOR articles submitted as Separate Cover
Attachmant “B" to this dispatch. E

SECURITY

12,. There have been no incidents of security nature
hazardous to the LIANCHOR project during the reporting period,

FINANCE AND SUPPORT

13, Finance: During 1 October - 30 May the LIANCHOR
project expenses,ihave consisted of U.S. $5,600 in salary pay-
ments to(LINLUCK ‘at U.S. $700 per month and U.S. $119 in cost
of mailing out LIANCHOR articles.

14. Suppor: Reproduction of the LIANCHOR articles for

Station using a Xerox machine.

@

because LIANCHOR cannot properly be run from -
( LINLUCH) will describe to Identity-1 the probléms which
‘ne has had in developing LIANCHOR and, in asking Identity-1
to take over control of LIANCHOR, will suggest that
Identity~1 use the LIANCHOR name and established publica-
tion outlets to broaden his prestige. in Latin, Americ;
without any thought of trying to oarn fees «| GINLUCK will
also suggest that Identity-] retaia Identities 6 and 9 to
help fill out the service, vut that he gradually try to
draw in personal writer friends or definite leftist fame
and persuade them to contribute to LIANCHOR purely, for
the reward of increased prestige. Finally (LINLUCX) will
offer to continue to contribute material from time to
time from Guatemala which Identity-1, through his good
standing in the Mexican press, peshaps can publish in
Mexico. G
Ooh

b, If Identity-1 rejects recruitment, the next candi-
date for LIANCHOR chief is Identity-10, who has already
toid @Im.uck)that he 1s prepared to take over LIANCHOR
on a pro O|.ionary. basis to see whether it will enhance his
reputatio., The Station feels that Identity-10 would be
easier to recruit than Identity-1. However, Identity-10
is not too well known in Mexico and is totally unknown
abroad, One of Identity-10's virtues is the:fact that he
never formally quit the Communist Party and has done nothing
to irritate the Party. As economic and general reporter for
“EXCELSIOR" he offers placement potential, If Identity-1
does accept recruitment, the Station still intends to try
to recruit Identity-10 as a singleton under Project LIANCHOR,
possibly steering Identity-10 to Identity-1 and the LIANCHOR
press service after due consideration. The Station is also
interested in the possibility of recruiting Identity-10 in
order to send him to the World Youth Festival at. Sofia,
since it is believed by(LINLUCK) that Identity-1 still bas
access to some worthwhile contacts in Central American
young Communist circles. a“

16. Testing for Indications of Effectiveness to Determine

Future Direction of LYANCHOR Project:

a. It is estimated that it will not cost over U.S.
$200 to hire clipping services in Buenos Aires, Montevideo,
Santiago and Bogota for a three month trial period to test
whether newspapers which receive LIANCHOR material in those
cities are publishing the LIANCHOR material, The clipping
services will be asked to watch for articles with the
LIANCHOR by-line, the by-lines of LIANCHOR writers and the
headlines or titles which are assigned by LIANCHOR to the
articles mailed to the newspapers.

b, If the clipping service tests show that newspapers
or periodicals in two of the above cited countries are
publishing LIANCHOR material, Station will continue.to
pursue the development of a small and responsive leftist
writer group as one phase of the LIANCHOR operation. The
rationale behind this decision is that there is little
justification in operating a press service, even a cheap
one, with a readership limited to Mexico, Central America,
Venezuela and Bolivia, However, if the press service can
acquire, or has acquired, readership in any two of the
countries in 16—a above then it is felt that the total
areu coverage is significant and worth maintaining.

17. Conversion of LIANCHOR to Temporary Roof Project for

Singleton Leftist Writer Assets: If as a result of clipping

told to use the LIANCHOR stationery and list of publishing
newspapers to develop his own prestige and readership abroad,
but he will not be ash to find additional writers for the
press service, At the cnd of FY 1969 the LIANCHOR project will
be terminated as such add its funds and such agents as have
