to persuade a number of leftist and center

loft writers to join together as contributors to the

LIANCHOR (Identity-2) press service.

The contributing

writers or membors of the press service were to agree

to waive fees for a trial period during which the press

service was to develop paying clients among Latin

American newspapers and periodicals.

(INLUCK) Involvement in Covert Action Operations Targetted

Against Soviet Poet Yevgenyl YEVTUSHSNKO (March-Apri] 1968):

8.

In March (LINLUCK) drafted an open lotter to Soviet

poet Yevgenyl YEVTUSHENKO asking the Russian to use his

influence to persuade the Soviet government to end the

persecution of Soviet intellectuals, artiste, witters and

poets. @INLUCky managed to obtain the signatures of stu

dents, professors, actors, dancers, writers and intellec

tuals for his open letter

and then persuaded the publisher

of his books to print thousands of copies, which were

distributed by other assets of the Mexico Station.

copy of the open letter was published in "EXCELSIOR" on

the day of YEVTUSHENKO's arrival in Mexico for what was

originally billed as a personal trip.

Because of the

open letter and critical press coverage of YEVTUSHENKO's

rude behavior towards the press on arriving at Mexico

City airport, the Russian Eubassy called a special press

conference the evening of the day of the poet's arrival.

At the press

conference YEVTUSHENKO spoke with outrage

of the open letter, carefully dodging a number of questions

asked by the letter, and chided the signers of the letter

for claiming there

was absolute literary freedom In Mexico,

asking how there can be freedom anywhere in the world ag

long as there is no freedom in Vietnam.

YEVTUSHENKO' g

remarke about the open letter left no doubt that he had

cone

to Mexico as & Soviet propagandist and not as a rebel

poet.

LINLUCK) also produced a handbill quoting the

telegram by Soviet intellectuals to the "Congultative

Conference of Communist Parties" at Budapest, asking for

an end to Soviet persecution of intellectuals in the USSR.

The handbill featured two pen and ink drawings of imprisoned

Soviet poets Sinyavsky and Daniel.

Via Idontity-4 LINLUCK)passed guidance material

to Mexico's top female poet, Margarita MICHELENA,

concerning YEVTUSHENKO. MICHELENA published a serles

of professional criticisms of YEVTUSHENKO as a poor"

poet and opportunist in the Mexican press.

In April,

Immediately following YEVTUSHENK)'s departure, & con-

densation of the MICHELENA critIques of YEVTUSHENKO Were

published in the leftist political illustrated magazine

"IMPACTO" by LILISP-E.

Identitles 3 and 6 of the LIANCHOR group also

published articles against YEVTUSHENKO In the rightist

dally 'EL SOL", but the Station felt the articles were

too vitriolic and unobjective to be a credit to LIANCHOR.

In fact, because of these articles the Station plans to

remove both Identities 3 and y from LIANCHOR; for it 1s

obvious that both persons have long since lost all traces

of their former leftism and are extreme rightists.

EFFECT IVENESS

Views on LIANCHOR Effectiveness by Owner/Director of

Guatemala Dally "EL IMPARCIAL":

During (LINLUCK's) Easter visit to Guatemala City

he was told by the owner of "EL IMPARCIAL" that the

newspaper was only interested in publishing LINLUCK's)/

articles.

rhe newspaper owner stated that (LINLUCK was

a well-known personality in Guatemala and also wrote

interestingly.

The owner also said that he had pub

a Guatemalan who at one time had been important.

the owner pointed out that the other LIANCHOR writers

were unknowns and did not write well.

of what she wrote amounted to libel or slander..

One of Identity-10's virtues is the fact that he

never formally quit the Communist Party and has done nothing

to irritate the Party. As economic and general reporter for

placement potential.

If Identity-1

does accept recruitment, the Station still intends to try

to recruit Identity-10 as a singleton under Project LIANCHOR,

possibly steering

Identity-10 to Identity-l and the LIANCHOR

service after due consideration.

The Station is also

interested in the

possibility of recruiting Identity-10 in

order to send him

to the World Youth Festival at Sofia,

since it is belleved by'(LINLUCK) that identity-l still has

access to

worthwhile contacts in Central American

young Communist circles.

16.

Testing for Indications of Effectiveness to Determine

Future Direction of LIANCHOR Project:

a .

It is estimated that it will not cost over U.S.

$200 to hire clipping services in Buenos Aires, Montevideo,

Santiago and Bogota for a three month trial period to test

whether newspapers which receive LIANCHOR material in those

citles are publishing the LIANCHOR material. The clipping

services will be asked to watch for articles with the

LIANCHOR by-line, the by-lines of LIANCHOR writers and

the

headlines or titles which are assigned by LIANCHOR to the

articles mailed to the newspapers.

b.

If the clipping gervice tests show that newspapers

or periodicals in two of the above cited countries are

publishing LIANCHOR material, Station will continue to

pursue the development of a small and responsive leftist

writer group as one phase of the LIANCHOR operation.

The

rationale behind thig decision is that there is little

justification in operating a press service, even a cheap

one, with a readership limited to Mexico, Central America,

Venezuela and Bolivia.

However, if the press service can

acquire, or has acquired, readership in any two of the

countries in l&a above then it is felt that the total

ared coverage is significant and worth maintaining.
