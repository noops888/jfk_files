consulate, Miami, Florida, by unidentified exiles.

the Frente Revolucionario Democratico.

that he obtained documents from one. Cuss Cuban sources. (KU)

There are enclosed herewith two boxes containing

photographic copies of

the material which had been made available

to CIA.

These enclosures were furnished to the Liaison Agent

on uctober 20, 1900, by so h. Horton,

CIA. It is his under-

standing that another package of photographs is being transmitted

to CIA Headquarters by the Agency's representative in Miami. @^W

Horton advised that contrary to his earlier understanding,

material was not disseminated to our Miami Office because the CIA

representative felt it was necessary to handle dissemination at

Headquarters bearing in mind that some of the documents are of a

communications intelligence nature. Horton further stated that

photographic copies of the material are being made available/to

the National security Agency.(s
