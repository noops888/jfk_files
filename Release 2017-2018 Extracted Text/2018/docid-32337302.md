ee sources] (¥ )

There are enclosed herewith two boxes containing
photographic copies of the material which had been madé ‘available
to CIA. These enclosures were furnished to the Liaison Agent
on October 20, 1960, by S. H. Horton, CIA. It is his under-
standing that another package of photograplis is being iam Ad)

A (GA)

(eae

to CIA Headquarters by the Agency's representative in Miami.

Horton advised that contrary to his earlier understanding,
material was not disseminated to our Miami Office because the CIA
representative felt it was necessary to handle dissemination at
Headquarters bearing in mind that some of the documents are of.a
communications intelligence nature. Horton further stated that
photographic copies of the mae rial are being made available /to
@ the National Security Agency
