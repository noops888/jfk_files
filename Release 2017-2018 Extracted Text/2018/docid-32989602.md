On 12/4/75, a meeting was held with th Vecwing
representatives of captioned Committee: Chief CotMsel F.A.O.
Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John T.
Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley. Representing the Bureau
at this meeting were Deputy Associate Director James. B. Adams,
Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis,
SA Paul V. Daly. op

‘
The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony off], J
12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and EL1iff fur-\\j,
nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's .
investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff oip-

the Senate Select Committee must address from a legislative
standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.
¢

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses
in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of
the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion
highlights. the fact that these investigations may be overbroad
in scope, collect irrelevant information, and. continue the in-
vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal
investigative conclusion. This portion also addresses the
investigative techniques. used during these investigations and
the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available
. to the Committee. These options run the gamut from abolition
of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions. to administrative
oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or
enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-
gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY: 75

The second position paper which was prepared by
John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis
of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-
telligence investigations. He then lists four options for
the Committee.

: Option 1 is for Congress to pass legislation ratifying
the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives
and Executive Orders.

Option’ 2 suggests. Congress might give serious ‘con-
sideration to creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency
within the Department of Justice. In this Option, E1Liff sug-

_ gests that :the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of
. the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions
from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3. considers the elimination of FBI domestic
intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be
possible for the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence
information through ‘its: normal criminal investigations and
thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-

_ gations as presently conducted.

Option: 4 considers. setting standards for domestic
intelligence investigations. In this Option, Elliff states
that the FBI should be authorized by statute to. conduct domestic
intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular
criminal: investigations would not provide information to an-
ticipate or prevent the use of. violence in violations of Federal
law and that incidents of the use of. violence in such violations
are of a serious nature and threaten the security of the country.

For purposes. of. the Director's appearance on 12/9/75
before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response
.{to. questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should
ibe that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing the various
oposals and that it would not be appropriate at ‘this. time for
he Director to. comment regarding. the substance of the proposals.

RE: SENSTUDY. 75

Elliff£ indicated during. this meeting. that the Director
during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by
one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American
Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the
sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-

_ gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a
question concerning his position on COINTELPRO. Regarding
the question concerning the Director's statement before the
American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-
sion will draft a proposed resonse. Concerning COINTELPRO, a
response has been prepared and will be put together with the
briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights. the Options
presented in the attached papers. A more detailed analysis
should be prepared by the Intelligence Division and existing
documents addressing these proposals should be made available
for the Director's briefing book for his. testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

(1) That the Director respond to questions concerning
the attached position papers. as set forth above.
Dore:

(2) That the Legal Counsel Division draft a proposed
response concerning the Director's statement made in Montreal
relating. to the sacrifice of certain individual rights.

I. Background

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee
with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's
internal security intelligence program:

A. The program is massive, involving the collection of
. information on the activities of thousands of innocent,
law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but
citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of
"subversion" and "extremism" -- purely ‘homegrown "threats
to the national security".

Cc. ‘That FBI policy on “subversive" and "extremist" inves~-
“tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated
whose threats to the national security were tenuous,
if not non-existent. :

2. collection of information on the personal life and
political views of subjects unrelated to the national
security.

3. the continuance of investigations well after it
should have become obvious that there was no legiti-
mate predicate.

Dd. Particularly invasive collection techniques were used,
including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and sur-
reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,
the predominant and perhaps most-insidious continues
today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source
network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-
tions is disseminated regularly throughout the federal
government and to local law enforcement.

F. Until 3971, information collected through these investi-
gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO pro-
gram tc the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and
others in an effort to discredit or "neutralize" alleged

"subversives" or ree aan 7

~2-.

The FBI's internal security intelligence program was
used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard
Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by
collecting information on critics or political

. Opponents.

The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,
and although parts of the program were shared with out-
side authorities from time to time, until now no
President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee

has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

The program is not authorizéd by statute but is’ founded ©
on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,
which in turn are based.upon a questionable assertion

of “inherent constitutional authority"

The program continues today, albeit on a much more
limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,
and the hasic machinery for the program -- the huge
informant/confidential source network -- is still
operating. : : See : wean

There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-

‘ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney Generai,

er President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-
gram to its earlier dimensions. :

II. Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with
former Attorneys General in response ‘to. what the Committee
has learned are the following:

A.

7

Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security
intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone
ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out
of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-
gram, such as the infamous Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues:

1. Whether there are not some functions (e.q., protecting
the President, preventing or at least predicting
violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting
civil disorders) which require intelligence collec-
tion.



gts

2. ‘Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in
that respect, especially in light ‘of a recent GAO.
report suggesting that such reports.are rarely use-
ful in predicting violent ananninainit

3.: Whether such. information, ‘assuming it is valuable,
Fl could not be obtained through more traditional eriminal
investigations. :

4. Whether the value of thé information, margindl or
otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties
inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous
grants of authority have been expanded into major
authorizations,.any statute short of a total prohibi-

: tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi-

. ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-

vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered
‘by this Committee. (Or, conversely, whether it is
possible to draft a law authorizing a limited civil
» disturbance: and counter-terrorist intelligence mission
that will not eventually evolve, like the National
Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated
and unwanted covert activities. )

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI
to criminal investigations without also (a) placing
limits upon the length of investigations, (b) the
i kinds of information which can: be collected and dis-
! : seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged
‘criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless
electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-
sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization
of a huge informant/confidential source network with-
out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

B. Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of
internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon
the program designed to minimize the infringement upon
civil liberties, an option being actively considered by
the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
Many of the issues set out under the first option and, °
in addition:

Iar32989602 Page 7



1. Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be
written which do not so hamper the administration
of an internal security intelligence program as to
make the product not just marginal, ‘as GAO suggests, .
but worthless. *

‘2. In light of the possibility. that the present Attorney
: General may address this matter via internal Justice
Department guidelines, whether this approach does
not ignore the legal authority question which can -

only be resolved by statute.

3. Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-
sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough
to meet an evolving threat and at the same time
Place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4. Even assuming there'is no absence of legal authority,
is it safe to leave these guidelines in the form of a
departmental order which can be rescinded by the next
Attorney General?

C. Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply
ratifying the present ‘program via enactment of a statutory
charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct an
internal security intelligence program subject to its own
internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposed
by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and:

. 1. “Whether sich a statute would not be an unconstitu-
tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2. Whether enactment of such a statute'would not repre-
: sent a failure by the Congress to confront the issues
¥aised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft
guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and
painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines
are not adequate. This analysis, which will be presented when
Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that
several of the more questionable FBI investigations (e.g., of
Dr. King and the women's liberation movement) would st
permissible under these proposed guidelines.

NW 55013 DocId?32989602 Page 8 i"



fale Whether it is practical for the Attorney Gener

Legislative Inaction. Enact no-new statute affecting
the FBI's legal authority or: the internal security intel-
ligence program.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1. Whether this failure to act might not leave the
status of the program in doubt and subject to court
challenge. au

2. Whether this failure to act after full disclosure
by the Bureau might not be taken by the FBI and the
courts as a ratification of the program. .

Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The

Justice Department should be required to exercise greater
administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security
intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless

_of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider

the following issues:

or
his staff to review thousands of such investigations
each year. :

2. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should
review all or just the so-called "full" investiga-
tions,

3.. Whether, to facilitate the conduct of such reviews,
the Attorney General or his staff should be given
"complete" access to Bureau files, including informa-
tion regarding the identity and reliability of -infor-
mants and confidential sources.

4. Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career
attorneys within the Department with both the access
and independence essential to the conduct of search-
ing reviews. :

5. Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not
also be required to review various informant and so-
called "intensification" programs, and the establish-
mént of specialized indices (which have a significant
ampact upon which cases are opened) instead of just-
reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum as
provided by the Attorney General's draft guidelines.

NW 55013 DocId¥32989602 Page 9



F. An.Inspector General. _In addition to the above options,
an independent Inspector General should be created to
investigate improprieties by the FBI. This option is
advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the

. FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former
Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry
.into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and
the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses
in the King case.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider
the following issues: .

1.

G.

Whether it is possible to maintain the independence
of an Inspector General within the Department of
Justice when both the Inspector General and the
Director of the FBI will be prereset to the same
official, the Attorney General.

Whether the Inspector General should have "complete"
access to Bureau files, including information per-
taining to the identity and reliability of ipformants’
and confidential sources.

Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely
sensitive information might not become a serious
threat to the independence of the Bureau from poiiti-
cal influence and to the civil liberties of American
citizens. :

Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above

options, the creation of an oversight committee(s) in the
Congress, to which the Bureau would be required to report
and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee ghoula consider
the kinds of problems posed by ‘the Justice Department
oversight and Inspector General options discussed above
to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality
of its files.

He

Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects. In addition

to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make
frequent public reports on the details of its internal
security intelligence programs and policies and reveal
the details of improper intelligence investigations to
the subjects of those investigations.

NW 55013 DocIa!§2989602 Page 10



In weighing this option, the: Committee should consider
the following issues: :

1. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some
programs and policies and the details of some inves—
tigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of
legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-
ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging
illegal activities.

“FBI Eacisteon -_ PROPOSED QPTIONS

: In préparation for - the testimon ay. of ‘FBI Di rector
Kelley and Attorney General Levi on December 9 and 10, the
Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various a
proposals for legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.

This paper ‘sets forth some of the basic options.

A: Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing aah FBI is 18 U.S. c. 533,

which reads as follows:

: the Attorney General may appoint officials:
» ‘(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
“the United States, (2) to assist in the
protection of the person of the Presi
and (3) to conduct such other investigations
regarding official matters under the control
of the Department of Justice and the Depart-

ment of State as may be directed by the
Attorney General.

t

Clauses Q) and (3) are a possible statutory basis
for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation
of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may "assist" the

Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

OA formal agreement between the PRI and the

dent's safety.

secret service ‘sets forth ‘the, types of intelligence information’

"provided by the Bureau., ‘However, - ‘this agreement ahead that:
The FBI will not conduct investigation
of individuals or groups solely for the pur-
pose of establishing whether they constitute
a threat to the safety of the President and
certain other persons unless there is an
indication of a violation of ‘Title 18, U. S.
Code, Section 1751, or other statute over
. which the FBI has jurisdiction. (Tab A) eet
SeRmeeEeene Clause (3), recognizes that the Attorney General | may
direct the FBI to “conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined “official matters
undér the control of the Department ‘of Justice." This is a
possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI
intelligence investigations -- civil disturbance intelligence
and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security. Program.
The most.xrecent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice
‘Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding
civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President
designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to
coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.

The FBI is instructed to gather and report on "all significant

“incidents of civil unrest" and on “all disturbances where there

are indications that extremist organizations . . .-are believed

to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them." The

FBI is spécificaily advised to make reports “even when no

specific violation of federal law is indicated." On the other
hand, the FBI. is instructed 7s to report “every relatively in-
' significant incident ofa strictly ‘local nature “coming to 0 its
eeeiaaa (tab B) See - : zt
The Justice Department has given the following recent
instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the Federal -
Employee Security Program. Executive order 10450, as amended
by eae Order 11785, is int: cerpreted as requiring an’ FBI
investigation a organizations "with a potential". of violating
federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-
dence (or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. ‘he
FBI is advised ‘that "it is not ‘possible to set ‘definite para-
meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential
” organizations ‘falling within the Order." The FBI is instructed
“to ‘apply "the same yardstick" to investigations Of individuals
who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-
“cally advised that "it is not necessary that. a crime occur
before the investigation is initiated." (Tab C)
Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney general
may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal
investigations, regarding certain undefined "official matters
under the control ef the Department of State." This is a pos-
sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of
. foreign intelligerice activities within the United States or to

.
“



‘collect positive foreign intelligence. Phe best example is

* the Attorney General's authorization of warrantless FBI elec-
tronic surveillance, for foreign intelligence PUTpOSeS. | However, |
: there is ‘apparently no instruction’ from. the Justice. Department
to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of
individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for
use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is.
no informatiop, indicating intelligence activity. (See Staff
Report, "Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and
the > Philosophy", October 14, aha ) : ,
‘- In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate
FBI Director James Adams made no “reference ‘ to clauses (2) and
{3) asa "possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga~
ions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.
Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of presidential
directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI
. interprets as authorizing it to engage in "domestic security
‘intelligence’ investigations". The Attorney General has codified
these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing
the FBI to:
Carry out the Presidential directive
of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-
dential directives of January 8, 1943, July
24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating
the [FBI] to take charge of investigative
work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,

subversive activities, and related matters.
28 C.F.R., Section 0.85(d).

NW 55013 Docla¥32989602 Page 15



The FBI als ‘o cites directives. -Of president Kennedy on June 9,
1962, and Attorney General Kennedy or. March 5, 1964, swhich

are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental. Intelligence
Conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs,cf the
military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to
coordinate “all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-
espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence
matters affeching internal security." (Tab D)

The theory behind the FBI's position ‘is that the Prési-
derit ,=has inherent constitutional, powers, at ‘Least in ‘the
absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence
activities. . The only judicial support .for this theory is :
language in ‘the Supreme Court! s opinion in ‘the Keith case,
which declared warrantless wiretapping of “domestic groups un~
constitutional.
rhe’ Court acknowl edged ae importance of "national secu-

xity ain its domestic’ implications ... especially at a time

of worldwide eet and when civil disorders in this ee
are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our
history." Under such circumstances, the Court stated, the.
President has a "fundamental duty" under the Constitution to
“preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States." The Court added, " Implicit in that duty is the power .
te protect cur Government against those who would subvert or

overthrow it by unlawful means." Hence, the Court appeared to
He .

.

Nw 55013 Docla32989602 Page 16



xecognize that the President's "domestic security role" has a
“constitutional basis"; that the President through the Attorney
General may need “to obtain intelligence information about ‘those
“who plot unlawful acts against the’ Government"; and that "threats
and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient
number to justify investigative powers with respect to them.

The Court applied the general principle, that "unless the —
ment safeguards its own capacity to function and’ to preserve

the security of its people, society itself could become so dis-
ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered."
Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that
this power may not be exercised in such a way as to, infringe
constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under
the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence

" investigations in the’ aaa of legislation, Congress has the
ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization ia
place of the Presidential directives. As Justice’ Robert Jackson
declared in the Steel Seizure case, “When the President takes
measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of

Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb. . . ." 343 U.S. 579,

_&B. option One -- Ratifying Existing Powers :
: ” The first option for Congress is ‘Legislation ratifying
the existing. authority granted to-the FBI by current Presiden=
tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in
extremely general terms. ts main advantage is that it would
provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also
reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super--
visor of FBI éntelligence activities, The statute would
rH authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:
saiaee oat to conduct investigations of domestic espionage,

counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive ‘activities;

2. to-gdther and report’ information ‘on civil dis®ur-

_bances;
7 3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-
gence matters affecting rmshdhastiee security; and ;
4. - conduct investigations of official matters relat-
a to the: Department of State. : :
In addition, the st tatute would require the Attorney General
to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees
on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the ;
investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures
Sita by the Justice Department and the FBI. alll
“Phe weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress,
would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without

.
.

_NW55013 Docta‘#2989602 Page 18



‘standards or limitations ‘other than’ the supervision of the
Attorney ‘General and. oversight -by Congress.. In‘ view of the®
Select Cominitéee' s findings as to the vast overbreadth ‘of FBI
“domestic” intelligence investigations and the abuses’ committed
in the name of "counterintelligence", Congress would in effect
be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past

_policies. : : =

€. Option Two -- A Separate Security Intelligence Agency

7 : ‘ dongress might give Serious consideration to legislation
creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the
“Justice Department. It A datace perform the functions of the
present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence
Division; dealing with £ foreign intelligence and counterintelli-
“gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this
‘option as part of the larger question of ‘separating all FBI
intelligence functions from the law enforcement functions of
“the Bureau, (Tab E) :

A Separate agency would be justified only if it was
authorized to conduct investigations of a wider scope and using
different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In
other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterinteili-
gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific
eximes, that techniques ‘such as electronic surveillance should 7

be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,

NW 55013 DocTd:a2989602 Page 19



‘and that operations should be. conducted id "counter" foreign
intelligence’ activities by means other | than arrest or “persona
non grata". proceedings. on the other hand, if Congress treats
iia investigation of ‘foreign intelligence activities the ‘same
asa criminal investigation, then the FBI should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for

: diplomatic roan. For example, Congress should not explicitly
authorize deception. Operations or efforts to compromise hostile
intelligence officers, seven though such techniques, may be
envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-
ding adequate procedures for authorization and oversight: to
ensure dccountability. ,

The legislation should be more specific ned it deais
with investigations and other operations directed at american
eitizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service ofa
foreign power. . Tf Congress believes Americans should be inves-
tigated if they have a marked potential for use by a foreign
intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence
activity yet exists, the egieieeion should say so.

The statute should also set out standards for determin-
ing whether a foreign~dominated domestic organization falls
within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should
at the very least be substantial information indicating that

the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active

NW 55013 DocId%32989602 Page 20

Nw 55013 Docla 332989602 Page 21

collaboration: with a foreign government or organization. (The .

term "foreign organization" refers, for“instance, toa group
like the Palestine Liberation organization.) I£ the group fits

tional finding that it may engage in ‘intelligence activities or
in activities involving the use of violence in violations of

’ If the;yroup meets all these standards, Congress may
authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond
regular criminal investigations. Such investigations, could
vextend to all individuals who — members of, or express sup-
port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the
organization to influence and control other groups: However,
it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of

thas merit ‘in view of the: limited amount of time the Attorney
" General can ‘give, to personal supervision, and the. antaneiuad “fact
role of legislative, oversight regarding the separate’ agency.
Finally, legislation 0 ‘create a’ separate foreign
counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the
Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other
_foreign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement
on their respéctive. jurisdictions is only a "memorandum of under-
standing". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine coun
activitiés within the United states, in coordination with the
FBI. | (Tab G) " Proposals are currently circulating in the Execu-
tive Branch for a new National Security Council tntetLigence
Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA
electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (‘fab H)
A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate

foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since
the focus is-on domestic intelligence issues, However, one
implication ef such a statute would be that the remaining FBI
functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminai

investigations.

D. Option Three -- Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's
effort to develop "guidelines" for FBI domestic intelligence —

is that regular criminal investigations are not adequate to

.

supply the information needed to’ anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal, law. That assumption.

should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are:

7 Likely to produce a substantial amount of information which
can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes..° For example,
intensive criminal investigations of ku Klux Kian violence in
the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to look
into . wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the
search for Weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-

tion which involves broad inquiries across the country. The
- FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information
it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which
would not have been conducted Ss regular criminal investigations:
The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by
its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the
" investigation was, automatically, outside the regular criminal’
law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-
"tion of activities “involving the use of violence in violations
of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,
regular eriminal investigations can also exténd to plans,
attempts, or conspiracies to engage in such activities.
One suggested difference between intelligence-type and

régular criminal investigations is that the latter are

- terminated after a reasonable time, if suffi¢ient evidence to

”

NW 55013 DocTd:§@989602 PBage 23


justify prosecution is not obtained. However, there is no
legal. reason why the prosécutox’ cannot. request that the inves-
tigation continue indefinitely as long as there is information
that’ violent activities ahd plans for violence are still under-
aot The degree of evidence needed to justify a prosecution
is certainly greater than the degree of evidence needed to
justify an investigation.

“ALL this is not to say that no further standards are
needed to guide regular criminal investigations when they may
touch on sensitive First. Amendment or other constitutional
interests. This is especially true of criminal investigations
of individuals or groups engaged both in lawful political, ox ;
social activities and in unlawful violence or plans for vio-

, lence. fo what extent is the advocacy of violence a proper
basis for initiating an investigation? Should an investigation
be initiated onthe basis of allegations or other information ,
that an individual is a member of, or has. expressed public
support for, an organization which has as one of its objectives
the use of violence? Should an investigation be started on all
members and public supporters of an organization, some of whose
members have acted in concert to use violence?

These questions are addressed in the draft Attorney
. General's guidelines for domestic intelligence investigations

under the heading "preliminary irivestigations". (Tab I) Since

#

NW 55013 DocId:22989602 Page 24 7



the guidelines asstime that there should be intelligence inves-

tigations, they ‘do not consider whether, such investigations;
might be’ permitted as regular criminal: investigations.

‘The Klan and -iweat herman examples. again illustrate the
point. Once it has been established that a particular Klan
group is engaged in or planning violence, it seems reasonable
_to conduct at least preliminary inquiries to determine whether
the members and supporters of the group are involved in the ;
violence -or the plans for violence. Similarly, the search for
Weatherman fugitives who committed bombings’ and other ‘acts of
violence would’ appear reasonably to include preliminary
-ingquixiés to determine whether other Weatherman members and’
supporters have harbored the fugitives.

; On the other hand, it would seein unreasonable to!

investigate members and supporters of all Kian JFOUPS- across

the country on. the ground that some Klan groups have used
’ te

violence. And it appears equally unreasonable to investigat te
all. members and supporters of SDS because the Weatherman
faction engaged in violence. The scope of the investigation
must be logically related to its specific purpose, and not an
excuse for wide-ranging collection of intelligence.
There is one possible exception to the requirement that
. the FBI only conduct regular criminal investigations. The

" Attorney General (and the President) do require reports on

or

NW 55013 Doclds32989602 Page 25

major civil disturbances which’ may not involve violations of
federal law. The FBI should be authorized to gather such data
and’ make appropriate reports as part of its law enforcement
responsibilities. However; the data and reports should be
limited to information provided by local or state law enforce-
ment authorities or obtained in the course of a regular FBI
eximinal investigation. Where local authorities provide infor-

“mation about individuals and organizations which are not the
subject of a regular FBI criminal investigation, the data and
reports should not be included in the FBI's general files and
name index.

In periods of widespread civil disturbances, cnet
Attorney General may require a more systematic procedure for
maintaining and retrieving civil disturbance information.’ This
was the case in 1967, when Attorney General Clark created the
“intérdivisional Intelligence Unit in the Justice Department.
fhe IDIU stored and indexed civil disturbance reports separately
from the FBI. The data was used to help anticipate or ameliorate

disorders. IDIU has been abolished, although the basic function

of evaluating reports on civil disturbances is still performed

by the Justice Department. This function should also be
authorized by statute, and the intent of Congress should be
. that the Attorney General must obtain specific legislative

_ authorization for any future IDIU.

a

IDIU was not perfect. ‘under Attorney General John
Mitchell it suppiied'a list of names ‘of American dissidents
to the CIA. .- = (Tab J) It also was used in conjunction ‘with
grand jary proceedings inguiring into ‘terrorist bombings.
“Both of these activities should be forbidden by the: statute
authorizing the Justice Department to evaluate civil distur-
bance information. -
Finally, legislation may be needed to make clear that
the FBI is not authorized to conduct investigations of organi-
zations or individuals for the specific purpose of compiling
a body of data to be used in connection with name checks under
the Federal Employee Security Program. fhe same principle
applies to FBI "assistance" to the Secret service, under the
present FBI- Secret Service agreement. es
A statute must also address the FBI's current practice
“of maintaining an Administrative Index (ADEX) of the prime
subjects of current domestic intelligence investigations. The
past history of the’ FBI's Security Index and other target lists
(Key Activists, Agitator Index, key Black Extremists) suggests
the need to enact legislation banning the compiling of lists
of persons by the FBI, unless such persons have been arrested

er convicted for specific eximes and the list : is used in con-

nection with the investigation of such crimes.

\

These proposals to: limit the ‘FBI to regular criminal

investigations “and civil disturbance reporting must _ tested
against thet actual past experience of ‘the Justice Department

“and the FBI. ‘General: ‘instructions’ from the Department to the

Bureau may be overly vague, even within the framework of

criminal investigation. Two examples are Attorney Generali .

Clark's memorandum on riots in 1967 and Assistant Attorney

General Yeagley's memorandum of campus disorders in 1969. (Tab

K) The Nation of islam exchange between the Department and the-—

FEI jin ‘1973-74 is another illustration. (Tab L) : i :
Thus, there is no automatic panacea in restricting the

FBI. to criminal, Anvestigations. The need for careful scrutiny

of actual investigative policies and practices by Congress and

the Attorney General is just as great as if the FSi were

authorized te conduct domestic intelligence pavesetge tions.

The following are some of the basic elements which should
go into a statute embodying this option. It would authorize the
Attorney General to direct the FBI: :

‘1. to investigate violations of federal criminal laws,
provided that the scope and duration of the investigation are

logically related to its specific purpose;

E. Option! Pour -- Setting standards for Domestic Intelligence

The FBI. should be authorized by statute to conduct

domestic.intelligence investigations only if Congress finds

ioe that’ regular criminal investigations as described eee
would ‘hot ‘provide information to anticipate or prevent the use
of violence in violations of federal law, and (2) that the inci-_
dents of the use of violence in violations of federal law are
so numerous ard so serious as to constitute a significant threat
to the internal security or domestic tranquility of the United Tot
States. : ,
The fact. that there are individuals and groups who-
engage in violence, advocate violence, or believe ‘in the desir-
ability of the. ultimate use of beratatcia to: advance their
political | or social objectives is not enough a “justity SBI
domestic intelligence authority. There must be additional
findings that regular criminal investigations are ‘inadequate |
and that the overall threat of violence constitutes a serious
‘@anger to the country. , ,
Furthermore, if FBI domestic intelligence is authorized
by statute, it should be an annual authorization which must, be
renewed each year upon reconsideration by Congress and the
fanmiartaaie:d General of these factors. Past experience indicates
that the annual appropriations process —— not provide an’

appropriate forum for considering the FBI's basic authority.

,

NW 55013 Docld%32989602 Page 31 ° 7 if 7



Attorney General Levi! s arat t guidelines provide a Heese
“for _the consideration ‘o£. a domestic intelligence authorization.
They do not cover the investigation of foreign-related
; “activities which may be directed by, subsidized by, ‘or other-
wise conducted in active collaboration with a foreign government,
a foreign organization, or their agents. (See Option Two above.)
: The ‘guidelines deal with five different types of threats ;

ich may constitute serious dangers to the country:

of violence wt
1 ; overthrow Of the, government (revolutionary violence);
aut 2. ‘interference in the U. S. mate the activities ofa
foreign government (bombing a consulate, attempting to > assassi~
nate a visi iting foreign leader); Stee Teer sear
ae 3. . interference with the functioning of the government
(OF the flow of interstate Eonine eal to influence federal Bolieces
{viclent protest activities, terrorist bombings) ; ;
4, deprivation of: civil rights (Klan violence,, violent
protest against busing) ; ;
Se incitement of violence which may require the use of

federal military force (riots, major civil disturbances accom~

q panying protest demonstrations).

The guidelines also refer to violence directed at state govern-
ments, either overthrow of a state government or interference

with the functioning of a state government.

NW 55013 Docld?g2989602 Page 32



fee : : es : Hore : e

Authorizing legislation should indicate whether domestic
intelligence is necessary: for any or. all of these specific prob- -
lems. For example, revolutionary wiolence, in an attempt to
‘overthrow the government may be a remote and speculative danger,
while ‘terrorist bombings may be substantially interfering with
the functioning of the government. Klan violence was unques-
tionably a serious danger to civil rights in the early and mid-"
1960'S, but is. it so today? Major riots and civil disturbances
were equally Perth in the late 1960's and early 1970's, but
not in more recent years. Violent interference with the func-
‘tioning of a state government shoulé, -under, our federal system,

normally be dealt with by state and local law enforcement. -

Therefore, the definition of the purpose of FBI domestic

‘aft

intelligence can he simplified. The attorney General's dr
guidelines might be revised to authorize FBI domestic intelli-

gence investigations:

1. to ascertain facts or information which serves to

anticipate and prevent the use of violence in violations of

federal law intended to

a. interfere, in the United States, with the

activities of a foreign government or its authorized represen-

ftatives; and =

lee Ee eee

o aereeeeeet |

b. interfere with the functioning of the government

“of the United States or the free flow of. interstate commerce in

order to influence policies or decisions of the federal govern-

This formulation concentrates on the most likely current serious
danger to the country, namely, politically motivated terrorist
violence. ‘FBI Director Kelley's recent public statements have
stressed the aincrease in terrorist activity from 24 bombings in
1973 to 45 terrorist bombings in 1974 and 46 such bombings in
the, first six months of 1975. : . :

However, this increasing threat is not the only factor

’
to be considered. In the course of. the FBI's regular criminal
investigations of these bombings and other incidents of terror-
ist violence, can it obtain as a by-product substantial infor-
mation which may serve to anticipate and prevent future vio-
“ence? If so,, the need for proader intelligence-type investi-
_gations is less evident. a :

The draft guidelines provide that the FBI would conduct
full-scale intelligence investigations on the basis of
“specific and articulable facts justifying the conclusion"
that an individual, or individuals acting in concert, may be
engaged in activities which may involve the use of violence in
violations of federal. law. The two "mays" render the require~

_ ment of "specific and articulable facts" almost meaningless.

" Therefore, any legislation should authorize the FBI:

*



Lsnvesoas_nocrasS¥onseos - Page 35

en See

2. to’ conduct full domestic intelligence investigations

on the basis of specific and articulable facts justifying ‘the

conclusion that an individual, or individuals acting in concert,

- are éngaged in activities which are likely to involve the use

of ‘violence as described in 1 above.

The draft guidelines also discuss the surveillance tech-
niques to be used in full domestic intelligence investigations, .
including infdrmants, mail covers, and ‘electronic surveillance.
The guidelines note that additional techniques may need to be
covered, such as inquiries made under "pretext", photographic
surveillance, "trash covers", etc. However,. the legislation may
deal with techniques more generally by providing that the FBI
is authorized: : ; =

3. to take only such investigative measures as are

sanctioned by rule of law, procedure, or judicially recognized

“or accepted investigative practices, and are not in violation

of state or federal law.-

More detailed regilation of investigative techniques for full
investigations will be considered elsewhere.

, The scope of domestic intelligence investigations under
the draft guidelines is broadened considerably under the pro-
vision for "preliminary investigations". They can he

initiated on the basis of allegations or other information that

. an individual, or individuals acting in concert, have advocated

“ activities which may involve violence, or are members of, or

.
.

v



a 6 2.
Se anton ; : i"
have expressed public support for, an, organization which has
as its objective activities which may involve violence. The
purpose of the preliminary investigation is to verify er refute
: the allegations ox information: However, the vagueness of the
standard is obvious. Therefore, to be consistent with the

eriteria for full investigations, the FBI should be authorized:

_4. to conduct preliminary domestic intelligence inves~

tigations on the basis of allegations or other information that

an_ individual, or individuals acting in concert,

. a. advocate the.use of violence as described in 1

above; HoH :

b. are engaged in activities which are likely, to

involve the use of violence as described in 1 akove;

c.. are members of or have expressed. public support

. for an organization engaged in activities which involve, or are

likely to involve, the use of violence as described in 1 above,

provided that other members of the organization are currently

the subject of a full domestic intelligence investigation or a

regular criminal investigation.

ai Unless these changes are made in the guidelines, they would per-
mit investigations similar to past investigations which have
been seriously criticized. .For instance, they would allow in-
vestigations of all SDS members or all Black Student Union lead-

-.ers.on the ground that their activities may involve violence,

NW_55013  Docla+32989602, Page 36



we ee i.

eat though’ there is no specific allegation of likely involive-
ment in violence. . :
Another reason for the revision, is to exclude ‘those

_ investigations which would be. justified-as regular criminal
investigations. thus, ‘allegations or other information that
an individual, or individuals acting in concert, have engaged
in or plan to engage in activities which involve the use of
violence would’ fall within the FBI's regular criminal investi-
gative jurisdiction. Intelligence investigations would extend et
further at the preliminary stage to cover advocacy of violence
and membership in ‘or public support for organizations involved
“in or likely to be involved in violence. Full investigations
require a likelihood of violence, short of actual violence or

plans for violence. : : :

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Diego Emilio Bordas Hernandez and his brother,

Luis Manuel Alfredo Bordas, have emerged in the current
Dominican crisis as important financial, political and
military advisors to the deposed Dominican President Juan ~*
Bosch in the latter's efforts to regain control of the
Dominican Government. Diego Bordas is a wealthy shipping
executive currently residing in exile in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
having been born in the Dominican Republic on January 11, 1923.
He served in various high posts under Juan Bosch during the
latter's short occupancy of the position of President of the
Dominican Republic in early 1963. Bordas spends much of his
time at 868 Ashford Avenue in San Juan, using an apartment F
at that address as his residence during the absence of its
owner, Jose Antonio Benitez Jiminez, from Puerto Rico.
Jose Benitez is the cousin of Jaime Benitez, the latter the
Director of the University of Puerto Rico and a close a
' -associate and advisor of Juan Bosch. Diego Bordas also ae oe
maintains a residence at 21 V, Florencia, Pueblo Viego, a .

suburb of San Juan, near the current residence and headquarters
rh of Juan Bosch, Diego Bordas and his brother jointly operate
7 a Shipping business known as Bordas and Company at Highway
4 Number 2, Puerto Viejo, Puerto Rico, and his financial
dealings in support of the Bosch efforts can reasonably be
expected to be conducted from this commercial establishment.

The Bordas brothers have both been the subjectsof
numerous allegations indicating their cooperation with
procommunist and pro-Trujillo factions in Dominican politics
and are apparently opportunists who have seized the current

DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO

Spe rronemmen rE

Martin Luther King, during the sanitation workers'
strike i. Memphis, Tennessee, has urged Negroes to boycott.
downtown white merchants to achieve Negro demands. On 3-29-68

- King led a march for the sanitation workers, Like Judas leading
lambs to slaughter King led the marchers to violence, and when
. the violence broke out, King disappeared.

eae gene a

The fine Hotel Lorraine in Memphis is owned and
patronized exclusively by Negroes but King didn't go there
from his hasty exit, Instead King decided the plush Holiday
Inn Motel, white owned, operated and almost exclusively white
patronized, was the place to “cool it." There will be no
boycott of white wzerchants for King, only for his followers.

IMATION CONTAN
Bee NSN Assi in
00 By
The following information is submitted regarding the
background Leading up to the proposed action recommended in
mezorandim G. C. Hoore to Mr. W. G. Sullivan dated March 29,
1968, captioned "Counterintelligence Program, Black Nationalist
Hate Groups, Racial Intelligence, (Martin Imther King)."
(copy attached)

This memorandum recommended that information be i
furnished to a cooperative news media source by the Crine
Records Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
showing King as a hypocrite. This was to be based on the fact
that when violence broke out during a march led by King in
Memphis Tennessee, on March 28, 1968, he disappeared. There
was a flest class Negro hotel in Memphis, the Hotel Lorraine,
but Eing chose to hide out in a white owned and operated
Holiday Inn Motel (also Imown as the Rivermont Motel).

A notation on the above referred to memorandum
indicated that the recommendation was "handled" on April 3,
1968, by Hr. Harold P. Leinbaugh of the Crime Records Division.
(see notation on memorandum dated March 29, 1968, attached)

femessee, at about 10:30 a.m. on April 3, 1968. (Information
contained in report of SA Joe C. Hester dated April 17, 1968,
Memphis, captioned "UNSUB, aka, Eric Starvo Galt, et al., Civil
Rights" page 48, See attached FD-302 reflecting interview with
Reverend Ralph David Abernathy).

For further background regarding the basis of this
proposal Atlanta teletype dated March 28, 1968, cantioned
"Martin Luther King, Jr., SM-C! with second caption "Sanitation
Workers Strike, Memphis, Tennessee, Racial Matters" reflects
that on March 38, 1968, King and other SCLC people were in
room 801, Holiday Inn, Memphis, Tennessee, at 4:30 nem. (copy
of Atlanta teletype attached) . : zs

A Memphis teletype dated March 29, 1968, captioned
"Sanitation Workers Strike, Memphis, Tennessee, Racial Matters"
reflects that Eing participated in the march of sanitation
workers on March 28, 1968. When violence erupted including
the breaking of windows and looting by the marchers, King and
a few associates ran to a nearby car and left the march
proceeding to Rivermont Motel where ther remained through the
afternoon and evening. (copy of Memphis teletype attached)

On July 17, 1975, Mr. Harold P. Leinbaugh, after
having had all the facts set out above reviewed with him
‘ including the fact his notation of “handied" appeared on the
March 29, 1965, memorandwm, advised that he has absolutely no
{recollection of this memorandum and can unhesiltantly state
that he cannot now recall whether or not proposed information
(was ever disseminated to any news media source. He indicated
Nthat his notation "handled" would not necessarily mean that
“he did disseminate this information. In explaining this he
Nstated that the notation could mean that he was merely clearing
_ this document through Crime Records Division and at this late
date there would be absolutely no way that he covld make any
positive statements as te whether or not the information
recommended was ever disseminated to a news media sovree.

From the above recorded sequence of events as
reflected in various communications identified above, it is
evident that King returned to Memphis, Tennessee, from Atlanta

on April 3, 1968, and checked into the Hotel Lorraine at
approximately 10:30 a.m. The notation indicating that the
proposed furnishing of information to the news media was
"handled" on April 3, 1968, would, of course, preclude any
such information from appearing in the press prior to King's
checking into the Hotel Lorraine at approximately 10:30 a.m.
on April 3, 1968. ee

A review of appropriate files maintained at FBI
Headquarters fails to reflect any newspaper article which
could have been an outgrowth of the proposed recommendation
contained in the G, C. Mcore memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
dated March 29, 1968.

: A review of the "Memphis Commercial Appeal" for the

would appear to be an outgrowth of the proposed recommendation
contained in G. C. Moore memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
Gated March 29, 1968. References were noted indicating that
xing held a press conferences at the Holiday Inn Rivermont

DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO

Martin Luther King,! during the sanitation workers?
strike in Memphis, Tennessee, has urged Negroes to boycott
downtown white merchants to achieve Negro demands. On 3-29-68
King led a march for the sanitation workers. Like Judas leading
lambs. to slaughter King led the marchérs to violence, and when
the violence broke out, King disappeared,

: The fine Hotel Lorraine in Memphis is owned and
patronized exclusively by Negroes but King didn't go there
‘£rom his hasty exit. Instead King decided the plush Holiday

_ Inn Motel, white owned, operated and almost exclusively white
patronized, was the place to “cool it." There will be no
boycott of white merchants for King, only for his followers,

Director Sec'y
During a conference on 7/16/75 between the Assistant
Attorney General, J. Stanley Pottinger, and his staff and the
Director of the FBI and his staff, a question arose concerning
Martin Luther King's alleged moving from one hotel or motel to
ano finer potel or motel in Memphis, Tennessee, prior to his murder
on .

Attached is a letterhead memorandum (LHM) setting forth
an inguiry including a review of all appropriate Bureau files
regarding a proposal made in memorandum G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C.
Sullivan dated 3/29/68 in connection with the counterintelligence
program wherein it was recommended that information be made
available to a cooperative news media source showing King to be
a hypocrite. This was to be based on the fact that when violence
broke out during a march led by King in Memphis, Tennessee, on
3/28/68, he disappeared. There was a first class Negro hotel
in Memphis, the Hotel Lorraine, but King chose to hide out in
a white owned and operated Holiday Inn Motel (also known as the ./
Rivermont Motel). The LHM will reflect and document the fact
that although a notation appears on the memorandum that it was
"handled" there.is no information available to reflect that it
was ever actually given to a cooperative news source. Mr. Harold
P. Leinbaugh (retired), who placed the notation "handled" on the
document, absolutely has no recollection of this matter nor can
he state whether or not the information was disseminated. -—- oe

: 5°88 KG, _ fre YO:

The time elements as documented in his LHM would
preclude the proposal contained in the 3/29/6§ memorandum of
having any affect upon King's cnoice of a motél“in-which.to reside.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached LHM along with attachments -be.. rig
disseminated to the Department. at

a the churches have offered support, no more money is needed
and any contribsted would only be used by King for other
purposes, This item would need nation-wide circtilation.
in order to reach all the potential contributors and
eurtail their donations. A sample item is attached.

ACTION:
That the facts about King's solicitation of

,

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), today finds himself
in the embarrassing position of having too much money, or at
least the probability of too much money. The SCLC sent out a
huge mailing to its contributors pleading for funds for. the
Washington Spring. Project, the "poor. people’s. march on™’:
Washington." Thousands of conc,ibutors were urged to support
the march financially in order to feed and house the demon~

7 strators., But the churches in the Washington, D. C., area

have offered to house and feed the demonstrators,

Now the contributions are beginning to roll in from
the mailing and King doesn't need the money. An embarrassment
of riches has befallen King, who will only use the money for -
other purposes. The churches had better come through with
all the housing and support the demonstrators need, because
there will bo little money left for the “poor People" by the
time the march rolls around.

As the march developed, acts of violence and vandalism broke

out including the breaking of windows in stores and some
looting,

This clearly demonstrates that acts of so-called

‘Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, injected himself into the
sanitation workers' strike in Memphis, Tennessee, and the ;
result of King's famous espousal cf nonviolence was vandalism,
looting, and riot.

Previously, King involved himself in this strike,
ealled for a general strike, and called for a ‘mass march.
Today he led the mass march in an automobile at the head of
the line. Negroes began shouting "black power" and trouble
began. King, apparently unable or unwilling to control the
marchers, absented himself from the scene; window breaking and
looting broke out. 5 :

Police officers were forced to use gas to break up |
the march and to control the crowd, It was necessary to
activate the National Guard. Martin Luther
much-heralded march on Washington, schedule
1968, will also be "nonviolent."! He says he#hés persuaded
militant black nationalists to abandon violent'‘extremism in
Washington, D. C., during the march. - Memphis may only be the
prelude to civil strife in our Nation's Capitol. i

Robert Wick by SSC Staff Members. Also enclosed is a copy of
the memorandum, with attachment, for forwarding to Mr. Jamea A.
VWilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President.

Your specific attention is invited to certain infor-
mation relating to the interview of Wick suggestive of
improprieties on the part of an SSC Staff Member. ‘The facts,
as known to this Bureau, are as follows. :

Wick first contacted this Bureau concerning the inter= %-
view by telephone on November 5, 1975, to advise that he h :
been called on October 31, 1975, by an individual identifyin}”
himself as Mike Epstein representing the $80. Epstein rei
Wick to come to Washington, D. G., for a two to three hou
interview concerning a matter relating to his "employment."

Epstein did not further describe the subject matter of the
interview and an appointment was arranged for November 7, 1975,
Wick said that he was uncertain as to the probable subject
matter of the interview because other matters coming within his
responsibilities as Vice President of Pan American World Airways ,
which were unrelated to the FBI, have been of recent interest
: to the SSC. Wick asked for advice of the FBI concerning this
wet matter. Thereupon, the Legal Counsel Division of this Bureau

| ee contacted Epstein and determined that the subject matter of

the interview of Wick would be Martin Luther King, Jr. A

return call was made to Wick on November 5, 1975, to advise him

The Attorney General

On November 6, 1975, Wick again telephoned this Bureau
and advised that he had been rather annoyed at Epstein's
initial approach to him; particularly, because Wick had tried
on more than one occasion during the telephone conversation
with Epstein to pry from Epstein the subject matter of the
interview but Epstein persisted in not advising him.

This Bureau's representative who had determined from
Epstein on November 5, 1975, the subject matter of the inter-
view has advised that when he made the inquiry of Epstein, he
asked Epstein why he had not told Wick the subject matter.
stein's reply was that Wick had not asked him, a statement
directly contradictory to Wick's advice to this Bureau,

The second suggested impropriety is that Epstein
contacted Wick prior to advising this Bureau of his intention
to interview Wick, an action which is contrary to procedures
which have been agreed upon between the SSC and this Bureau.

Re Los Angeles phone call to Assistant to the
Director JAMES B. ADAMS, 12/9/75. Pe

On 12/3/75, the attached article appeared in the

Los Angeles Times under the byline of reporter JACK NELSON. +
As indicated, the headline and lead paragraph which supposgdl

is based on ADAMS' testimony, clearly reflects that the FB

did nothing to prevent K violence-although we knew of

the contemplated violence. After discussing this matter/wWith
Mr. ADAMS and reviewing the actual testimony received in

the Los Angeles Division on 12/8/75, SAC ELMER F. LINBERG

and I met with Editor BILL THOMAS and National Editor ED

GUTHMAN at the Los Angeles Times.

I advised these gentlemen that I was aghast when I
read the headlines and the lead paragraph of this article
and could not believe that JIM ADAMS did not refute informant
ROWE's testimony that we took no action relative to con-
templated violence since I knew that this was contrary to
the rules, regulations, policy, and philosophy of the FBI
in 1960. I then called Mr. ADAMS in Washington, D. C., and
he likewise, was poset over the headline and lead paragraph,

because, according to ADAMS, he completely refuted these
statements in that we did disseminate the contemplated
plans of violence to the Birmingham Police Department and
to the Department of Justice in the form of a letterhead
memorandum.

I continued that I waited until I received the
actual transcript of testimony and told the gentlemen that
upon my review of the testimony of Mr. ADAMS and Mr. WANNALL,
I could not reconcile the headline and lead paragraph with
such testimony. I then proceeded to read several excerpts
from the testimony.

I advised Mr. THOMAS and Mr. GUTHMAN that my
immediate reaction was to prepare a "Letter to the Editor"
but felt after a re-analysis of the situation that this is
not a judgment question on the part of the newspaper, but
one of a slanted, inaccurate story either by design or
through misunderstanding. I therefore felt that the Los
Angeles Times, if it so desired, should be in a position to
correct the situation itself based on the facts.

Mr. THOMAS expressed appreciation for my approach
and stated that at the time he read the article, already
printed, a question came to his mind as to why the FBI did
not advise someone or take some action relative to contemplated
violence. He, however, took no further action. He said
in view of what I had read from excerpts of Mr. ADAMS' testimony
and the now available complete transcript of the testimony,
he intends to pursue this matter further and would prefer
not to have a "letter to the Editor", but rather correct
any inaccuracies on the part of the Los Angeles Times through
their own pursuit of further inquiring concerning this story.

Mr. GUTHMAN concurred with Mr. THOMAS and they
indicated that it appears the obvious question is based on
Mr. ADAMS' testimony of who in the Department of Justice
received this information relative to contemplated violence
and what did such a responsible Department of Justice official
do with the information. He agreed that based on the
information furnished to them, the FBI has been done an
injustice but that they, the Los Angeles Times, desired to
pursue this matter further.

It should be noted the article of JACK NELSON is
based on one specific situation, namely the testimony of
former informant GARY ROWE that he had furnished advance
information to the FBI to the effect that members of the
Ku Klux Kian would be given the opportunity to beat members
of the Freedom Riders without interference by law enforcement
authorities for approximately 15 minutes after which the
local law enforcement authorities would take action, and
that the FBI was advised of this well in advance of such
beatings and furthermore, the FBI took no action to prevent
this violence.

conceded Tuesday that the bureau
had failed to use an undercover
man's information to head off Ku
Klux Klan violence in Alabama in
the 1960s.

But, the official, James B. Adams,
assistant to the director, told the Sen-

; ate Intelligence Committee that the
FBI was "just as frustrated as anyone
else" at "rank lawlessness" that exist
ed in Alabama at that time. Also, he

agency and has no enforcement pow-

|. in Southern California under an assumed name. aie
Rowe was one of two former undercover operatives;

who testified before the committee Tuesday. The other, '
Mary Jo Cook of Buffalo, N.Y., told of supplying the FBI]
‘with information about 1,000 persons while serving as an }
informant against the Vietnam Veterans Against the Wari
during 1973-74,

‘Testimony by both witnesses prompted committee
members to criticize FBI tactics and to suggest that legal
restraints be put on future FBI activities.

Sen. Philip A. Hart (D-Mich.), commenting on testimony
by Rowe that he engaged in klan violence with the j
knowledge and approval of the FBI, observed that the;
bureau's infiltration of the klan not only failed to prevent
violence, "but indeed may have contributed to it."

Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Mont.) told Adams that the '
FBlhad bungled its job in investigating political activities |
' and added: i
'_ “It has interfered with civil liberties and finally in the
last month or two through its public disclosures has
heaped shame upon itself and really led toward the un-
‘ dermining of crucial public confidence essential to law en-
forcement agencies in the country."
Mondale criticized the FBI for trying to "protect people
from subversive and dangerous ideas," and he told Adams:
"Time and time again, we're going to protect the blacks
from Martin Luther King because he's dangerous. We're
«, going to protect veterans from whatever it is, we're going
« to protect the (National) Council of Churches from veter-
ansand s00n... 4
"Don't you agree with me that we've got to control this,
restrain it, define it, so that precisely what's expected of
the FBI is known by you and by the public and you can
justify your actions when we ask you?"
Adams disagreed that the F'BI had bungled in the politi-
cal intelligence field but agreed that restraining legisla- ,

at the time the bus was burned with the Freedom Riders in Birmingham,
Alabama, in 1961. He stated that he would like to know if Rowe had fur-
nished us information that the Birmingham Police were going to wait 15

or 30 minutes to go to the bus station in order to give the Klan an oppor-
tunity to work over the Freedom Riders. I informed Reeves that I recalléd¢
no such information being furnished to us at that time. I told him that ally
information we received concerning possible violence was furnished to the
Birmingham Police Department. He wanted to know, if there had been such
an agreement what action would I take. I told him that if I determined that
the police department would not take any action for 15 or 30 minutes I would
advise the Mayor gee tity and the Police Commissioner and if they felt the
same as the police sparinese ould then advise the Governor of the State.

He desired to know if I would call out the Federal Marshals. I informed him
that the FBI did not have any authority to call upon the Federal Marshals in

FBI BULLDING

In connection with the Director's appearance on December 9,
1975, to testify before captioned committee, it is possible that he may be
asked concerning recent proposals in the Congress to change the name
of the building. Three bills have been introduced in the House of
Representatives on December 1, 1975, for that purpose. H.R. 10905,
introduced by Congressman Gude of Maryland and H.R. 10918, intr t

by Congresswoman Schroeder of Colorado, would change the name ofthe XY
building to "FBI Building." H.R. 10916, introduced by Congress: N
Rangel of New York, would change the name to "Federal Bureau of Nj
Investigation Building. " All three of the bills were referred to the N
Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House, the NX

chairman of which is Congressman Jones of Alabama.

Memorandum J. Cochran, Jr. to Mr. Jenkins

RE: REQUEST BY SENATE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE
ON ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING USE OF DRUGS
FOR INTERROGATION

might be used to great advantage on copionage suspects. Navy offered to
inform us about this. A notation by Mir. DeLoach indicated that Mr. Parsons

would mect with Navy on 8/11/50.

Memorandum dated 11/6/75 from W. O. Cregar to Lir. W. R. Wannall
is attached which ccts forth details of our review of Navy files on this project,
including a Burcau press release which was to have been made in the event
that the Navy mentioned the FBI in their press release on this matier.

A voview of Bureau files for information relating to drugs designed to
modify behavior indicates an interest dating back to 1922. Howevor, this
interest has not extended to the point where the Burcau has conducted research
on behavior modifying drugs nor has it funded such research. We have maintained
liaison with other agencios, primarily the U. S. Army, and indusirial organiza-
tions in order to be aware of devclopments in this arca.

On 7/30/74, Laboratory and Training Division representatives mot
with representatives of the Biomedical and Chemical Laboratorics of
Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, to discuss the potential use of incapacitating
chemical agents in hostage situations. Although we have developed an aware-
noss of various ascents which may be used in these situations, we have not
conducted any research with these agents. Memoranda on this matter are
located in Bufile 80-807.

A sinele instance occurred where “truth serura" was administered in
a Bureau case. Truth serum was administered to Thurman Scruces Wilkins
at his own request while being interviewed in the Los Angeles Office,
April 26, 1947. Wilkins was allegedly involved with one Ignacy Saraucl
Witezak, the subject of a Sovict espionage cace (100-343077). The actual
drug uscd was sodium amytal and the actual adminictration was done by 2
physician. Prior Bureau authority was not obtained by the Los Angeles
Office in connection with thie incident. SAC Hood submiticd a Icttor of
explanation to the Bureau on July 2, 1947. This incident resulted in the
following information being set forth in SAC Letter 94-47 dated July 3, 1947:



ee é @

Memorandum J. Cochran, Jr. to Mr. Joakins

RE: REQUEST BY SENATE JUDICIARY SUBCOLMOTTER
ON ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING USE OF DRUGS
FOR INTERROGATION

"The Burcau will not tolerate any cxperiments or participation
on the part of its persomel in the utilization of the so called truth
Serums ov othor chemicale aliesed to have a similar cifert, ----
consequently, in the cvent any Eurcau agent viclates these instructions,
drastic administrative action will be talon."

There was nothing found in Bureau files that would indicate that we
have received any documents from CIA concerning their drug research
programs, The files do reflect that we were aware that CLA was conducting
research with lysorgic acid dicthylamide (LSD) and that Britich Intelligence
had suecessfully utilized LSD on several Russian espionare agents. The
information concerning CIA and British activities is set out for the benefit
of tho Dircetor only and cannot be released outside the Burcau.

There are tivo Burcau files which contain most of the information
rdlatine te the immediate orca of interect of the captioned Senate Subcommittee.
These files are 62~2695 (Truth Serums) and 80-645 (Chemical Munitions and
Gascs). Pertinent sorials may alsa be found in 80-07 and 100-343077 as
proviously noted in this memorandum.

I see no reason why Mr. Michie and Mr. Susman chould not be
afforded on oral bricfing regarding these matters, and if necessary male
pertinent sorials of Bufiles 62-2639, 80-645, £0-807, and 100-343077 available
to thor for review.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

() That Mr, Michic and Mr. Susman bo advised by Losal Counsel that
available Bureau records and interview with current lnowledycable employee
indicate the FBI has never engaged in nor funded anyone's efforts in research
and/or development programs in the use or effect of drugs on human behavior.
They should be advised our cfforts in this regard as far as can be established
from the available records consists of following throuch liaison contacts with
other government agencies and the private sector sources the current
developments in behavior modifying drugs.

and Baker sent to the Attorney General levying certain
requirements on the FBI with a request that the responses
be provided the SSC during, the last week of December, 1975,
and the first week of January, 1976.

Item 1 requested access to materials in the

The specific preventive actions were set out in some detail
in a memorandum prepared for the SSC by the FBI dated
December 10, 1975.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETIER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

there will be no investigative file but merely a commnication
from a field office reporting information furnished by a
source of the FBI on which some preventive action was
predicated. It is possible that the acts of violence
reported by the source could involve a violation over which
the FBI had no investigative jurisdiction. In such cases,

the Incal field office would have merely furnished the
information to the appropriate law enforcement agency and

no investigative file would exist.

We are continuing our efforts to attempt to
isolate those files which document preventive actions.
However, because of the problems attendant thereto, as well
as those problems raised in the subparagraphs of Item 1, ~
it is recommended that a meeting be arranged between Mr. John
ElLI£f£, Domestic Task Force Director, and representatives
‘of this Bureau to discuss possible alternatives to some of
these requests.

Items 2 and 3 concern the September 24, 1975,
report to the House Judiciary Committee by. the General
Accounting Office. The FBI is in the process of preparing
a response and it will be made available to the Committee
as Soon as possible. However, it is noted that the FBI
prepared no analysis at all on the findings of the General
Accounting %ffice contained in their report of September 24, 1975.

Item 4 requests the annual reports from the
office of origin to FBI Headquarters for the investigation
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1963 through 1968, end
the Women's Liberation Movement for the years that organi-
zation was under investigation. Item 4 also requests anmal
reports available on the investigations "about which
Materials were supplied pursuant to John Elliff's request
of Mctober 28."

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETLER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

There were no annual reports submitted by the
office of origin to FBI Headquarters for the investigation
of Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1963 through 1968. With
regard to the Women's Liberation Movement, the SSC has been
provided copies of all pertinent reports for the years the
organization was under investigation. In an effort to
clarify what is meant by the anmal reports available on
the investigations about which materials were supplied
pursuant to Mr. John. El1iff's request of October 28, 1975,
it is again proposed that a meeting with Mr. Ellif£ be
arranged to clarify this ambiguity.

Item 5 requests specific examples of cases where
the FBI has taken action in the past similar to that which
would be authorized by Section IV of the Department of
‘Justice's guidelines draft on 'Domestic Security Investigations."

The indices of this Bureau are not organized to
enable retrieval of information of a “preventive action"
character or examples of FBI actions taken to prevent
violence, ‘The retrieval of such information from FBI files,
other than that described in the response to Item 1, would
require extensive review and/or dependence on the recollection
of individuals of eccurrences extending back almost 20 years.
It is suggested that, during the proposed meeting with
Mr. John ELLAFf, this request be discussed.

Item 6 requests access to all FBI materials
pertaining to Martin luther King, Jr., the Poor Peoples'
Campaign and the Sanitation Workers Strike in Memphis,
Tennessee, from Jamuary 1, through April 4, 1968.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER :

_It is this Bureau's belief that all pertinent
material pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jr., for the
period January 1, through April 4, 1968, has been made
available to the SSC responsive to previous requests, With
regard to the Poor Peoples’ Campaign and the Sanitation
Workers Strike in Memphis, Tennessee, it is not clear
whether the letter is requesting access to the entire FBI
file on these two activities from the period January 1,
through April 4, 1968. It is recommended that a clarification
of this request can be accomplished during the previously
proposed meeting between Mr. John Elliff and representatives
of the FBI.

Item 7 requests all materials pertaining to
"Project Overshoe." 7

A check of indices of the FBI regarding “Project
Overshoe," as well as the word Overshoe, fails to contain
any reference to either. Without additional information
regarding "Project Svershoe,"' this Bureau cannot be
responsive to this specific request. Again, it is suggested
that, during the forthcoming meeting with John ELLIf£,
clarification of "Project Svershoe" be obtained.

7 This informative nomovandun to record unsucecssful
’ efforts to pinpoint the typowriter on which was typed an
: anonynous lottcr apparently directed to subject, the oririnal
| _ of which was located in papers left behind on the retironont
of former Assistant to the Director Willian C, Sullivan,

Exanination of the questioned docunent by the
Laboratory established thet the typing was done on a Royal
typewriter with pica style typo. “Wo checked available
inventory records mulntained by the Adrinistrative Division
as well as our own in IND to locate all Royal typowtiters
which wore in the thon Touestic Intelligence Division (DID)
around 1864, This scareh wis bascd on the suspicton that the
note was typed by Sullivan on a typewriter aczessiblo to hin
in 1004 when he was Agsistant Director of tho DID.

Our cheeks rovenled that there are availablo only
four typewriters of the type souglt which wero likely in the
DID in 1864, All four sre presently in INTD and three of then
were readily olininated as not identical to that which produced
the questioned cocunent on tho basis that all three have
closed "4s", whereas the questioned document has an open ended
"4", The fourth typewsiter, sesial nurber IMG 19-4320919, 15
raintained in roon 2410 and charged to the IS-2 Section, it
wan examined by Supervisor PF. HM. Pevine of the Document fcetion
of the Laboratory who advised that it is not identical to -the
typevriter which produced the questioned document.
