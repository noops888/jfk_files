MEMORANDUM POR RECORD

SUBJECT: The Wackenhut Corporation
3280 Ponce de Leon Boulevard
Coral Gables, Florida

i. Mr. Bannerman, Security Office, arranged through Chief,
CCS for the writer to meet Mr. Geor; zWackenhut, President of
subject, to explore its potential far cover| support. At 10:30
a.m., on 14 March 1963, Mr. Wackenhut, Mr. Wes Reynolds, and I
met at Mr. Reynold's home, 3809 37th Street, North, Arlington. -

~My. Reynolds apparently represents Wackenhut in the Washington

area, although I did not gather that the firm is. actually
operating here at present. Mr. Wackenhut and Mr. Reynolds, both,
are ex-FBI agents.

2. Wackenhut started his firm in 1954. In 1961 it was
reported to have 1100 employees and anticipated 1961 sales in
excess of $5 million. At present it has offices in Miami,

Corel Gables, Tampa, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, New York City,
Boston, Buffalo, Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose (Calif.), Honolulu,
Sen Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico. Wackenhut freely states that

he trades on the reputation of the FBI by publicizing widely the
21 ex-FEI agents, including two former Assistant Directors of the

Fat, in his management.

3- The Operating Divisions of the company and their services
are described in a Wackenhut brochure as follows:

Investigative Division
Performs all types of investigations for attorneys, insurance

companies, banks and other businesses; sets up internal eudit
systems to prevent embezzlements, and investigates personal back-
grounds of prospective executives, business partners and associates.

Scientific Services Division

Conducts pre and post-employment, pre-promotional and speci-
fle lie detector examinations for business and industry; speciel-
izes in technical security and investigetive techniques, scientific
detection devices, and electronic and mechanical security methods
and equipment, and performs electronic "sweeps" to counter business
espionage through the detection of electronic intrusion attempts.


and educational programs.

Internal Intelligence Division
Specializes in exposing and controlling inside thefts that may

range from employee pilferage, through embezzlement of thousands or
dollars, to highly valuable industrial secrets.

Central Clearing Division

Assists personnel and security directors to screen quickly
the backgrounds of present end potential employees through the
messive files of The Wackenhut ‘Yorporation.

Retail Store Protection Division

Increases net profite by reducing inventory shortages through
the control of internal end external losses with security programs
designed to meet the client's specific needs.

Treining Services Division -

Provides specialized training programs for security, fire
fighting, investigative and other personnel of business orgenize=
tions and professionel groups.

Industrial Security Division
Provides the essential security services that are required by

all companies seeking or handling goverment clessified contracts;
assists management in disaster and emergency planning.

Fire and Safety Division
Supplies ambulance services, first eid crews, Waekenhut fire-

men fully trained in the technical field of industrial and mmi-
cipal fire fighting and equipment, and safety surveys, systems,

Guard Forces Division

Selects, investigates, trains and supervises the uniformed
end plein-clothes guards who protect your operations; also provides
uniformed receptionists and guardettes; makes physical property
surveys to determine security requirements and establishes security
systems and controls.

4, Mp. Wackenhut wants to expand abroad, in view of his
successful venture into Puerto Rico. However, he has no definite
plans as of the present and seemed to be seeking from cla covert 1
sponsorship] for entry into areas of interest to us. He is pre-

ae~se :

5- It is not apparent to me that there is any significant
market for Wackenhut's services in foreign countries, except
possibly among American businesses with physical plants overseas.
The nature of these services, I would presume, would make rather
difficult acquisition of the necessary occupational permits in
many countries. The potential for clandestine intelligence acti
vities would be too Spvious to host governments, and the emphasés

fet aa

Rs


on former FBI personnel probably would enhance such suspicions,
particulerly in Latin Anerica where "FBI" means "intelligence"
since its WWII activities there.

6. CCB/NC on occasion receives requests for advice to busi=
ness orgenizations as to setting up security systems at overseas
installations. We recently referred a request of this type,
involving « major oil company, to the Physical Security element of
the Security Office. Conceivably, the Agency might make some
errangement to advise Wackenhut of such requests, providing pur own

Security Office is satisfied as to Wackenhut's compet: 24
could then [ arse desired,
ml & compeny succes

secure the contract.

T- Waekenhut seid he would be willing to dispstch teams to
set up personal security systems for foreign chiefs of state
whom the Agency wants protected. He is amenable, in fact, to any
reasonable application of his capabilities to Agency problems.

He would be willing to negotiate financing in equitable propor~
tions in the event an overt operation, set up at Agency behest,
were not financially self-susteining.

8. Weckenhut impressed me as a clean-cut, energetic, ambitious
young business man who is obviously proud of what & to be
a@ superior organization of its type. He is intere: profits,
but it is my impression he is sincerely eager to do what he can to
essist the government and feels that CIA offers one possible oppor=
-tunity. Incidentally, he appears somewhat younger in person then _.
in the pictures appearing in the promotional material given the
writer.

9. Copies of this memorandum are being furnished those Agency
components which might have an interest in utilizing subject come
pany. Inquiries may be directed to the writer.
