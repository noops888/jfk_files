M/R Antonio VECIANA, fund raiser for Alpha 66 and Second Front of the

Escambray. Developed by AUTOBOAT (C). Recently met by USAOSD. IN

connection with current considerations of policy by the Cuban Coordination

Committee, this case is being given active consideration as a means

for implementing ploicy when established. Accordingly, a letter containing

our recommendations has been forwarded the ACSI. This letter is to keep

AUTOBOAT (C) fully informed of necessary operational details, as they will

most likely retain operational control.
