Re Bureau airtel to Miami, 3/25/68.

In accordance with instructions set forth in
referenced Bureau airtel, the following is a succinct resume
of events linking ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA to the bombing of
captioned aircraft.

(1) Of the 7 documents issued anonymously in
the name of Cuban Power, two documents were similar in
typewriting and were signed with the name "ERNESTO, General
Delegate." The first of these was a three-page document
dated 1/22/68, setting forth the purposes and principles
of Cuban Power and claiming credit for instant bombing.

The second document was entitled "Declarations of Cuban

Power" and also claimed responsibility for the bombing

of the B-25 cargo plane at Miami International Airport. ,

(2) Mrs. OSCAR ANGULO
advised upon interview by’ fureau Agents, a at(anG

approximately 3:05 AM, 1/20/68, she had received a call
at home from an individual whose voice she recognized
as that of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, She indicated she was
in frequent contact with BOSCH and was thoroughly familiar
with his voice. The caller asked for ANGULO, and upon
being told he was not at home, stated, "Tell him we put
a bomb on the plane for Merida," referring to the B-25
cargo plane which was destined for Merida, Mexico.

After this statement, the caller hung up. Mrs. ANGULO
advised she received a later call at about 6:50 AM from
a person believed to be the same individual, and she
advised him her husband had gone to the airport. She
also inquired if this was not BOSCH calling, after which
the caller hung up.

(3) RICARDO MORALES NAVARRETE, who was arrested
by local authorities on 2/14/68, and charged with one of the
local bombings on 1/25/68, has advised during interviews with
Bureau Agents, that HECTOR CORNILLOT LLANO, his brother-in-
law, was responsible for the preparation of all anonymous
Cuban Power documents, utilizing the name "GERARDO TORRES
CONTRERAS," however, was not responsible for those signed
"ERNESTO, General Delegate," which leaflets were prepared

- by another faction unknown to him. Since MORALES' release

from jail on bond on the local charge on 3/1/68, according
to the statements of MORALES, ORLANDO BOSCH has sent several
messages to him to the effect that he wants to confer with
him. MORALES is of the opinion BOSCH wishes to confer with
him for the purpose of consolidating the two factions of
Cuban Power.

Regarding the above information from OSCAR ANGULO
REYES and his wife, it is noted both have advised they
will not be willing to testify to this. information, [because

TORRES CONTRERAS," This leaflet states
Cell Number 2 of the Cuban Power in Washington,
D.C, was responsible for the bombing of the
Sovie[t Embassy on 2/21/68. The leaflet was
postmarked in Miami on 2/23/68, and is
believed to be an attempt on the part of
CORNILLOT to capitalize upon the publicity
surrounding this bombing,

of Cuban Power. Cell.Number 1. GERARDO

leaflet was distributed by HECTOR CORNILLOT |
along with a number of other young Cubans
