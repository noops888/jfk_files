Memorandum L'Allier to Belmont
Re: CARLOS MARCELLO

epee nnceec ce
did not know how the information had leaked to the press
ut he assumed that there must have been some notice given to
i newspapermen in the U.S. Because of this sudden appearance of

newspapermen, Guatemalan officials found it necessary to process
the subject's entry in a clandestine manner and in another building
which blocked any contact with newspaper people. This worked
successfully and the subject was immediately removed to a hotel

in the city.

} According to the Sealey appr learned what happened

and some of the local writers began criticizing the Guatemalan
President for his involvement in the entire episode. Some of the
President's political opposition accused him of protecting a
hoodlum. Ydigoras became greatly incensed, bearing.in pind that his
political position is extremely shaky. He accused Rr mishandling
the entire matter and has refused to deal with on
any other matters since the above-described event.

’
Because of the pressure being placed upon him ‘by political
opposition, Ydigoras realized that it would be necessary to remove
the subject. On or about May 10, 1961, Marcello allegedly was to
be returned to the U.S. via Pan American Airways, who had agreed to
accept him as a passenger even though he would be inadmissible in
the U.S. Pan American reportedly did this because Ydigoras had.
issued orders cancelling flights of all airlines going into and out
of the country if they refused to take Marcello as a. passenger.
Pan American apparently decided to gamble because the threatened
cancellation would be seriously damaging to the airlinds business.

Stated that Marcello never appeared at the airport
and a check at the hotel indicated that he had disappeared. Later
a report was received that Guatemalan officials had forced to
El Salvador, which country had refused to accept subject. 3)
pointed out that as far as he was concerned there was no tra
the story. He was convinced that arrangements were made between
Marcello and. Guatemalan officials whereby Marcello was abk to
(or Mas ree move to a finea (farm) in the interior of Guatemala.
