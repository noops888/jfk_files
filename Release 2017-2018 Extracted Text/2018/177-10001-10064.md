WOULD START, HE SAID THINGS ARE VERY CLEAR AND THERE, 1S NO DOUBT THAT THEY

HAVE ASSASS INATED HIM, THE CONTRADICTIONS ARE WELL DEFINED AND THE MOMENT WAS :
VERY SPECIAL, LIKE THAT OF THE MAINE. MARTINEZ SAID THE UNITED STATES IS NOW
IN THE MOST DIFFICULT POSITION OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN LATIN AMERICA,
THE WORLD, GOULART, ARGENTINE PETROLEUM, PERUVIAN LANDS, CHILEAN MINES AND. IN |
GENERAL ALL OVER LATIN AMERICA, TOHA SAID HE WAS VERY WORRIED AFTER READING
THE CABLE TRAFFIC. MARTINEZ ADDED THAT IF THE USA IS THINKING OF INVADING
CUBA THEN THEY MUST HAVE EVERYTHING ALL PREPARED AND ALL THE STRATEGY °READY AND
“THEREFORE THE ALARM MUST BE GIVEN SO THAT CUBA CAN BE PREPARED, |

B, THE CUBAN CONSUL AT VALPARAISO CALLED THE CUBAN EMBASSY: IN SANTIAGO TO
DETERMINE POLICY IN THE MATTER OF FLYING THE FLAG AT HALF MAST. ‘THE REPLY WAS.
THAT THERE ARE NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE USA AND THAT “NO OFFICIAL WORD j

“HAD YET BEEN RECEIVED FROM CUBA, SO THEREFORE NOTHING: SHOULD BE DONE. (FIELD
COMMENT: THIS IS AGAINST PROTOCOL BECAUSE THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECREED
OFFICIAL MOURNING INCLUDING FLYING FLAGS AT HALF MAST.)

C, MARTINEZ REFUSED TO MAKE FURTHER STATEMENTS PREFERRING TO WAIT FOR
OFF IC LAL WORD FROM HABANA, SEVERAL TIMES HE DENIED THAT THE ASSASSIN WAS
INVOLVED IN THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE INSIST ING THAT THIS PERSON IS ONLY
A SUSPECT AND THAT EXTREME RIGHTISTS OR SEGREGATIONISTS ARE TO BLAME, MARTINEZ
SAID HE BELIEVED THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WOULD TRY:TO PUT THE” BLAME
ON CUBA, ,
