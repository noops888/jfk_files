SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

DATE:

MH 55261

Captioned matter pertains to Bureau's handling

of requests from Senate and House Select Committees to

study

governmental operations with respect to intelligence

activities.

In connection with the work of these committees,

staff members may seek to interview current and former FBI

employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff

has interviewed several former employees, and it is anticipated

that many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the

Committee, and we wish to assist and facilitate any investiga-

tions undertaken by the Committee with respect to the FBI.

However, we do have an obligation to insure that sensitive

sources

and methods and ongoing sensitive investigations are

fully protected.

Should any former employee contact this office

and have any question regarding his obligation not to

divulge information obtained by virtue of his past FBI

employment, he should be instructed to contact Legal

Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call.

Converstions with former

employees must

be in keeping with our pledge. It is believed

such a procedure would insure proper protection and also

facilitate the work of the sSc.

The above procedure also applies to current employees

of the FBI.

If any current employeer is contacted by the

Committee, advise the SAC immediately.

SUBJECT:

CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS RE FBI

BX SENATOR CHURCH COMMITTEE;

U. S. ATTORNEY SIDNEY I. LEZAK

INFORMATION CONCERNING

DATE: .12/16/75

Per our previous discussions, this is to record that

at 11:55 a.m., 12/11/75, U. S. Attorney LEZAK telephonically

contacted me, asking for

an official response from the Portland

FBI Office concerning any involvement by the Portland Division

in the matters being covered in captioned hearings. Mr. LEZAK

stated he had obtained

i prior approval for this request of us

from the Public Information Office, U.S. Department of Justice,

Washington, D. C.

I advised Mr. LEZAK I would consult with you

and return

his call, it being noted Mr. LEZAK said he intended

to use our response in a public statement.

On your instructions, I telephonically contacted

ERVIN L. RECER, Inspector-Deputy Assistant Director, External

Division, FBlHo, Ior assistance in replying

to Mr. LEZAK'S

I informed Mr. RECER you suggested we respond by saying

the information Mr. LEZAK is generally interested in is being

disclosed in public hearings in Congress and that separate FBI

offices will not be reacting individually to inquiries from

outside the FBI. I made this call to Mr. RECER at 12:55 p.m.,

advising him Mr. LEZAK had requested a response before 2:30 pm

the same date.

At 2:08 pm, Mr. RECER telephonically contacted me,

saying I should advise Mr. LEZAK all of the information that

will be made public concerning FBI activities of present interest

to Congress is being furnished through public testimony before

appropriate ongoing

Congressional committees and further, that

we are in no position in the Portland Division to comment beyond

these proceedings.

ina smuch as he was on the phone at that time. At 2:20 pm,

Mr. LEZAK called me and I provided him with the remarks

recommended by RECER.

Mr. LEZAK said this was satisfactory,

in that he just desired to be in a position to say he knows of

no impropriety on the part of the Portland Division of the FBI.

RECOMMENDATION:

You may desire to record your subsequent call to

Mr. LEZAK the same day as an addendum to this memorandum.

ADDENDUM:

At 2:55 pm, 12/11/75, I telephonically contacted

LEZAK stated he did not and stated he would reply to

any news media inquiry along the lines suggested.

I took the opportunity to point out to LEZAK that

he and his staff were fully knowledgeable of the capable and

professional job done by Agents of the Portland Office and

that any statement made to the press should reflect on that

pertormance. He agreed, stating if given the opportunity

he would "brag" concerning the performance of the Agents
