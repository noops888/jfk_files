Memorandum

: ALL AGENTS DATE: 5/5775

:SAC JOHN W. O'ROURKE

suBjpcr: SENSTUDY 75

Captioned matter pertains to Bureau's handling
of requests from Senate and House Select Committees to
study governmental operations with respect to intelligence
activities. In connection with the work of these committees,
staff members may seek to interview current and former FBI
employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff
has interviewed several former employees, and it is anticipated
that many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the
Committee, and we wish to assist and facilitate any investiga-
tions undertaken by the Committee with respect to the FBI.
However, we do have an obligation to insure that sensitive
sources and methods and ongoing sensitive investigations are
fully protected.

Should any former employee contact this office
and have any question regarding his obligation not to
divulge information obtained by virtue of his past FBI
employment, he should be instructed to contact Legal
Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call. Converstions with former
employees must be in keeping with our pledge. It is believed
such a procedure would insure proper protection and also
facilitate the work of the SSC.

The above procedure also applies to current employees
of the FBI. If any current employees is contacted by the
Committee, advise the SAC immediately.

From :  ASAC JOHN-E. OTTO : ; : _

SUBJECT: CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS RE FBI
BY SENATOR CHURCH COMMITTEE;
U. S. ATTORNEY SIDNEY I, LEZAK
INFORMATION CONCERNING

Per our previous discussions, this is to record that
at ll: 55 a.m,, 12/11/75, U. S. Attorney LEZAK telephonically
contacted me, asking for an official response from the Portland
FBI Office concerning any involvement by the Portland Division
in the matters being covered in captioned hearings. Mr. LEZAK
stated he had obtained, prior approval for this request of us
from the Public Information Office, U.S. Department of Justice,
Washington, D. C. I advised Mr. LEZAK I would consult with you
and return his call, it being noted Mr. LEZAK said he intended
to use our response in a public statement.

On your instructions, I telephonically contacted
ERVIN L. RECER, Inspector-Deputy Assistant Director, External
Affairs Division, FBIHQ, for assistance in replying to Mr. LEZAK's
request. I informed Mr. RECER you suggested we respond by saying
the information Mr. LEZAK is generally interested in is being '
disclosed in public hearings in Congress and that separate FBI
offices will not be reacting individually to inquiries from
outside the FBI. I made this call to Mr. RECER at 12:55 p.m.,
advising him Mr. LEZAK had ident a response before 2:30 pm
the same date.

a At 2:08 pm, Mr. RECER telephonically contacted me,
saying I should advise Mr. LEZAK all of the information that
will be made public concerning FBI activities of present interest
to Congress is being furnished through public testimony before
appropriate ongoing Congressional committees and further, that
we are in no position in the Portland Division to comment beyond
these proceedings.

At 2:15 pm, 12/11/75, 1 telephonically contacted
ur. LEZAK's office and left word for him to return my call,
imsmuch as he was on the phone at that time. At 2:20 pm,
Mr. LEZAK called me and I provided him with the remarks
recommended by RECER, Mr. LEZAK said this was satisfactory,
in that he just desired to be in a position to say he knows of
no impropriety on the part of the Portland Division of the FBI.

RECOMMENDATION:

; You may desire to record your subsequent call to
Mr. LEZAK the same day as an addendum to this memorandum,

ADDENDUM: a

- At 2:55 pm, 12/11/75, I telephonically contacted
USA LEZAK regarding this matter inquiring if he had any
specific comment concerning the comments given him by ASAC
OTTO, LEZAK stated he did not and stated he would reply to
any news media inquiry along the lines suggested,

I took the opportunity to point out to LEZAK that
he and his staff were fully knowledgeable of the capable and
professional job done by Agents of the Portland Office and
that any statement made to the press should reflect on that
performance. He agreed, stating if given the opportunity
he would "brag" concerning the performance of the Agents
currently assigned to the Portland Division.
