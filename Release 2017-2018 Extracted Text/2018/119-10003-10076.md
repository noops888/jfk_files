* ‘BIO DE JANETRO

1. Security Forces Charged with Protecting the President

A. Departmento Federel de Segurance Publica (BSP)

Responsibility for the security of the Presidential party
by lew vests ‘with the Departnénto Federal de Seguranca Publica
which hes its main headquarters in Brasilia. The nationwide
authority of this unit, hovever, is challenged by various other
State and Federal entities and it is generally recognized that
the Departmento Pederal de Seguranca Publica simply is not.
capable of effective action outside the Federal District. In
the Rio de Jeneiro area, the protection of the Presidential
party will be the responsibility of both the Guanabara Police
and elements of the Rio-based Mirat Army.

The Gushebara Departinerito da Segurenca Publica (SP) is
headed by Chief Newton Marques Cruz. Our representative has
tet with Chief Cruz in connection with security requirements
during President Kennedy's vieit. Qhief Cruz introduced as
his principal essistent in this effort a Dr. Antunes, Chief
Divisso de Policia Politica y Soeiel (DPPS). Chief Cruz sald
Shat he is prepared to offer every assistance to the U.S.
authorities with regard to the visit. He said that the police
department. would work in cooperation with the Firet Army for
the protection of President Kennedy while in the Rio de Janoiro
area ené offered the services of two key officers (Inspector
dairy end Inspector Endo) to accompany the Presidential party
wbéle visiting other areas of Brezil. Dr. Antunes said that
he hes approximately 350 men in his gection but that this
number can be augaented as required by drawing on other sections
of the police department which total about 18,000 men. ‘the
Becret Service officers should meet with Chief Cruz. and Br.
Antunes. Cruz, who has been in his present job for.a little
over two months, is the sixth chief of police in the last
thirteen months.

B. Bizet sroy

he commander of the First Army is fourestar General Osvino
Alves. Our representative had beer-in touch with him in
connection with the security aspects of the visit and the
General has promised full colleboration end assistance. Ue
has dustructed the following key officers to hold themselves
available for plenning with the U.&. Secret Service persomel
upon their arrival: General dose Ribeiro, Chief of Staff of
the First Army; Golonel Antonio Negreiros, Deputy Chief of
Stefe of the First Army; Colonel Napoleon Nabre, Chief of 2nd

wd ted to J a Hostile Attitaudk
Goward the Visit :

A. Brezilien Gommmist Party (PCB)

While the Hrazflian Communist Party, with a membership of
approuimately 30,000 in the country and 2,800 in Guansbara State,
now follows a non-violent policy to echieve ite goal, it can
nevertheless be expected to muster its forcad within the oneal
labor and preas fields to stage demonstrations, make speeches, and
Qieplay propaganda materials such as posters, banners and
wollpaintings critical of the United States in general and of the
President in particular. As of 5 July 1962,. the Party had made
no plans to demonstrate ageinst the visit of sident Kennedy to
Brazil during’ the time the latter wes scheduled to be in. this
country. Among the plans made by the Party. end scheduled for the
period of 20827 uly were the following: :

A. Mags demonstrations egaitiet the visit and the
allience for progress in the more important
elties.

B. Official protests against the vielt by lebor
end student groups

C. Mase distribution of propaganda materials and
paintings of valls and sidewalks An protest
against the visit

B. Communist Party of Brazil (CPB).

The Communist. Party of Brazil is a @issident group which has
broken with the Brazilien Communist Party and aflvocates violence,
along the lines of Fidel Castro's Cuban Cominmists, to achieve
dite goal. While the Commmist Party of Brezil has relatively
fey meabers and much less organizational capability then the
Brazilion Coummist Party, certain individuals within its renke
might conceivably attempt some sort of violent action against
the President or his entourage.

@. Ressent Leagues

The Peasent Leegues are Commmist-orientated rural groups con+
sisting of rural workers, tenant farmers, and tmall lend owners
concentrated mainly in the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba in
Northeast Brazil. A prominent Peasant League leader, Francisco
dalieo, while not eimitting to Commmist Party membership, is
definitely a Commnist sympathizer snd strong advocate of the
policies of Fidel Castro end Mao Tse-tung. le is a protagonist
of the violent overthrow of the government through peasant
uprisings. Followers of Francisco duliae cen be expected to attempt
+~© demonstrate in Rio de Janeiro against the President's visit.

A report. previously farnichea your office indicates that
these elements. are planning to make a red paint bomb to be
throw at Mrs. Kennedy.

DB. Cuban and Soviet Bloc Bubassies

Cuban and Soviet Bloe Imbasaies can be expected to marshal
aélected assets to create disturbances and incidents designed
tomer the success of the Presidential vieit.

&. Leonel Brizola, Governor of Rio Grande do Sul

Ieone], Brizola, vellelmown leftist, anti-American Governor
of Rio. Grande do Sul, may very possibly take advantage of the
President's visit to inspire further anti-American speeches and.
actions not only in his ow state; mit also in Rio de Janeiro.

3. : tag ile with ce in Visit

The identities of sll offictals vho will. participate with
Goulart. in the visit are not Imown at this time. It is
expected that @ new Cabinet will be foxmed prior to the time
of Président Kennedy's arrivel and that other major changes
will remit in Goulart's officiel household.

It can be ascumed that Reul Ryff, Prees Secretary to
Freaident Goulart; will survive any major dhake-up in the
Brezilien Goverment if Goulext survives. Ryff accompanied
Goulert on the recent visit te the United States. Ryff has a
dong history of Commnist activity, dating hack to the 1946's.

A report dated September 1961 said that Brasilisn Commniet

: oh Party leaders considered Ryff a militent member of the

~ Brdailion, Communist Party who vas expected to be of great vaine

Goulart.

be Tssués . Situations thet Could be ot: Sppoeit: to
Creste Hosts Lity

At the present time there ere fow 1f any local situations
oy issues that vould have mass appeal and could be exploited by
the opposition to create hostility. ‘There are the usual themes
of econcntc exploitation of Brazil by "foreign trusts", U.S.
militery “occupation” of Brazil which refers to the size of

U.S. militery missions end the frequency of visits. of U.S.
militery, interferenessia: the Internal affaires of Brazil. through
insistence on beste reforiis In connection with the Alliance
for Progress, ete. It is more likely that tne opposition could
get more mileage from some such themes as the current nuclear
testing by ‘the United States or the alleged intervention in
Cuban affairs by the U.8.. Government.

forces again shoved their ability to cope with hostile crowds
and street demonstrators. ‘The good will generated by the
friendly reception of President Coulart on his recent tip
to the United States will be 9 factor in insuring @ similar
reception for President Kemedy. It is expected that the
Braviiien official attitude tovards the visit will be highly
favorable and that this in turn will contribute towards a

‘ similar attitude on the part of tho press end the public.

unfler the Ministry of Justice ang Interior Affairs, has the

end the training is insilequate. This hes beén yvemsdied te some |
extent, however, by the training given to the DIGP by the ICA poltce
tradaing program in effect sinee 1999. The lack of continuity in eee
leadership and therefore of long range objectives has also been a

Bipdrence to the efficiency of the BYEP. Heverthsless, it is believed |
that the DIS? will be capable of controlling any enti-United States - tun
Senonatrations which may arise during the President's visit. : fete

Colonel Catrolt has been reported to be yro-Commmiet. Regardless’
of bis yoraonsl political beliefs, he can be expected to use his full ~ ,

approximately 2,500 officers and mm. it is
uéed chiefly on patrol ani traffic duty.

@ The Usnicipal Police, consisting of approxic
mately 2,300 officers and men.

Before President Rennedy's arrivel in Brasilia, our represent-
atives there will have established contact with key officers of the
DFSP. They vill be able to provide whatever intreductions are
necessary and desired.

Contact hae beet made by our representatives with the Chief of
the Golas police in Goiana, the capital of Gotas, a city about two
or three hours away from Brasilia by automobile. Ee has agreed to
xeport to our representatives on any activities. and orgenisetions
vhieh mlght be expected to cause trouble for the visit.

Our representative in Brasiiie has eiso been in close contect
with Dr. Gilberto Alves Siqueira, the Chief of the Criminal Section
of the DFSP. He ts an experienced ond capsble officer and will try
to participate in DSP discusaions regarding the visit. Gur
representative intends to maintain close contact with Dr.. Siqueire.

a Sat a See eiaaote Expected to Assume @ Hostile Attitude

Our Brazilien representative has xepox'ted that there are certain
groups vbich ore likely to take limited action in protest against the
President's visit to Brastlis. ‘the Brezilien Commmist Party and
possibly the dissident Comuntst Party of Brazil (which has recently
broken off from the Brezilien Commrtet Perty), strongly anti<United
States nationalist political organisations (especially those which
support Governor Leonel Brizola of Ric Grante do sul), and supporters
of the Peassnt Leagios of Francisco Julico comprise these groups.

The capability of these forces to take hostile action is Limited
by the eather isolated location of Brasilia and the character of its
population. Government employees make up the bulk of the populetion
ana they exe unlikely to becons @ nucleus for hostile activities. Thos
Moin forces of the Communist and oltraenationalist gtoups are located
in other parts of Brazil. Any large scale demonstrations vould
necessitate the transportation of lerg® nubers of demonstrators tate
Brasilie from outlying areas. Phere is-a possibility of demonstrations
from the students of thé National University of Bresilis and from sitll
lebor organizations in other cities. In either case, the number of
demonstrators. vould be small. piers
