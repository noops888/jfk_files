On 29 December 1971 OLTHANG invited the Cultural Attache of the
Russian Embassy YETSOV for an evening in his house, The invit-
ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representatic:
At the same time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journali
KUZNETSOV should ask OPALEV and IZ¥EKOY to come along with him.
The date agreed’ on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was
changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed
on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.
From the invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted
to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTMANS w:
the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section D is able
report the following:

source ~ OPPERS.

1, In September 1970 OLTNANS says with some surprise that he sudde:
iy received an invitation to a party at the Russian Embassy.

le thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But
his thinking is along the lines of those people.

2. In October 1970 OLTHANS appears to be interested in an intervie:
with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISIIANI who allegedly was connected
with American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think
ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role,

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the state committee for scienc:
and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed
Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALIV
from the Russian Embassy; OLTNANS would still like to have an
interview with GVISHIANI.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate
with the NOS. (TV),

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very
extensive,

Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the
Club of Rome, OLTNANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-
ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.

Also present at this discussion was the former nembor of the Rus
Embassy FEDPROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committe:
for science and technology.

visit to Noscow.

FODERCVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Embassy in The
Hague about it.

GVISHIANI who at the same time is chairman of the commission for
environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTMANS to
make a film at the same time about the environment administratior
in the Soviet Union to support the international environment
conference to be held this year.

Begining May it becomes clear that since OLTNANS' discussion 1
GVISHIANI, OPALEV's attitude towards OLTMANS has greatly changed.
OPALEV is now all willingness.

In May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI and receives an inv-
itation’ to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August
and the whole of September, where he could film ten scientific
institutes,

GVISHIANI told OLTMANS that he had complete trust in him.

In June 1671 OLTMANS again contacted GVISHIANI, this time in
Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of Rome.

Begining October 1971 OLTMANS again saw GVISHIANI in Paris, wher«
among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The Nether]
in the second week of October.
OLTNANS did his begt to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting Tae Neth-
erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for
instance with Philips).

In November 1971 OLTMANS,from the Russian state television an
offer for a five year contract to make exclusive films in the
Soviet Union.
This offer was made to OLTMANS during his visit to the Soviet
Union, It is concretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to
film a number of scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.
On 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further
with GVISHIANI in Geneva.

On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will make another visit to Moscow to
discuss making the above mentioned films without the participati
of the NOS. At this opportunity OLTNANS will leave behind a memo
about LUNS in connection with OLTMANS' present agitation against
the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTHANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to
visit Moscow,

Referring to the meeting in OLTMANS' house on 18 January 1972 i+
can be reported that on 17 January 1972 OLTNANS stated that he
is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him or
18 January; their reaction in connection with OL’ 3' request
to the general prosecutor of the High Council to bring action
against LUNS.

On 19 January 1972 it was reported that HOFLAND (one of the guc
invited to the evening in OLTMANS' house) called before his
arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend.

Afterwards this friend appeared to be Peter ZONNEVELD from De
Telegraaf.

OLTHANS said that at the press conference which he (OLTMANS)
will give on 20 January 1972 several guests, Milo ANSTADT, Rob
KOPUIT and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against the attac
