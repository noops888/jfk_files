7, UNWOYED is of the opinion that subject would be most receptive
to a proposition of doing intelligence work and furthermore believes that
if subject could supplement his present income: by an additional £200 or
$360 per sonth, he would be willing to renain with Tk, shich he Likes
and is only considering leaving ‘ue ‘to his present low total income, much
of which is spent in connection with activities required by his positiou,

when questionéd as te his opinion concerning subject's potential value
as a covert. agen’, -as well as ‘his reccuttability, has pointed ‘cut very
strongly that subject, due to the very nature of his personality, mst
be given a good deal of operational gaidance and be closely controlled.

he has known hin far a good gany years and as a close friend, knows nis

9. He request that consideration va given to the advisability of
-.endeavoring to recruit subject and, in the event of a favorable decision,
that provisional operational clearence be given in order that sub,
be approached on the subject of engaging in intelligence work,

safely zake the first approach and, if subject accepts and final security
is obtained, he night eventually be’ turned over to UIEICYED for explcita
