LIFEAT coverage of the

home'of-a Cuban Cormeroial Attache provides Information of. Interest.

concerning Cuban cormercial cantacts and purchases.

(5) LITEAT/EXIle - LIFEAT Coverage of ESLARD-I has been must rewarding in

terms of his contacts, travel, and future plans.

This Information

.:has been of interest to Headquarters. LIFEAT has exerted every effort

to provide continuing coverage of this target even when ESIARD-1

resided in a hotel under an allas and following his move to new

quarters.

Coverage by LIFEAT was especially difficult during E-l'e

stay at the hotel stnoe the technical problems were considerable and

the

processing of all calls to and from the hotel in order to extract

E-l's calls was a heavy burden on the LIFEAT processor/translator

start.

It Is noted that in Station's opinion the LIFEAT complex

showed up particularly well In this assignnent.

LIFEAT coverage oil

Inas been especially

frultful concerning the travel and contacts of Costa Rican Communiets,

Including their travel to Cuba. It has also provided some leads

concerning ZRKNICK operation.

(6) LIFEAT/American Communist Group In Mexico (ACGM) - During the reporting

period local ODENVY requested

that LIFEAT coverage be initlated on

David DRUCKER, prominent member of the ACUM. Product from this

coverage, 1n

conjunction with that coverage Already being provided

on Charles SMALI (aka SHOLIKOFF), is valuable to ODENVY in providing

data on U,3, Communists who travel to Mexico and contact the nembers

of the ACCM.

Information 1s also provided on the dally activities

and contacts of members of the ACM.

(7)

LIFEAT Miscellaneous - Coverage of a former SNOTH agent at the

request of Headquarters resulted in the knowledge that this former

agent was In contact ith a number of Soviet Satellite personalittes

and was exercing a strong Influence on a frlend of his, a PBPRIME

eitizen employed as the local representative of a well known PEPRIME

news media.

It became apparent that the PBPRIME oitizen, through

his connection with the news media, was being encouraged by the former

SNOTH agent In an attempt to

"destroy" the senior ODACID official

Early warning to this official resulted in action which

greatly diminished the effect of this effort. Coverage of both the

former SMOM! agent and the PBPRIME citizen is being continued.

•LIFEAT coverage was also placed on the, private office of a

romean ery General based on a iead hat he was the contact of

who was guiding

a number of vexican army officers of troop command rank who would. sup-

port

in any show of force.

LIFEAT coverage, however, pro-

vided no Information of value and wes discontinued.

Since LICOACH returned to his native Western European
