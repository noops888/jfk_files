through May 1963, most of the items of interest to the project were included in
the’ review through that'date, The following report contains those items not
fully reported or not inaluded in that review plus items of interest occuring
-during June 1963." Except for the abcve noted period, LIFEAT progress reports
‘generally ill be forwarded on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis.

section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).

A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS

@) LIFEAT/Soviet = During the reporting pertod LIFEAT has
continued its daily coverage of the home phones of two known
Soviet.intelligence officers, Information and leads from this
coverage provide the interested Station Officer with a valuable
heck on the Soviet contacts of several KUBARK controlled
double agents, There 1s also provided the type of information
on daily activities of Soviet personnel without whieh the plan-
ning for and successful completion of the technical surveillance
operation against one of these Soviets would have been impossible.
Station believes that LIFEAT contribution to the success of this
operation deserves particular mention,

() LEBEAT/PoLtsh - LIFEAT support to the BEKKAVE/SECHICK operation
in recent months has been particularly noteworthy in providing
travel piansof EEKNAVE, During the intensified efforts*against
BEKNAVE in the “coming month plans for periodic live-monitoring
by LIFEAT have been couplete’ an’ should provide a valuable support:
yo this operation,

(3) LIFEATAugoslav - Of continued interest to the Station has been
the information concerning ‘the locations’ being considered by the
Yugoslav inlssion-for a few embascy, Station plenning for a technical
operation ih this area has depended héavily on LIFEAT leads,

. |. Qh) LIFEAT/Cuban.- LEFEAT coverage tn the AMSTRUT case provides a
“\". Wiindow.to the ‘operation Witch 1s of interest to WAVE and Headquarters,

(Transéripts from these two ines are forwarded semi-Weekly tothe in-

terésted“Headquarters component and WAVE.) LIFEAT coverage of the

home-‘of-a Cuban! Comieroial Attache provides information of- interest

* concerning Cuban, ereial eantacts and purchases.

le - LIFEAT coverage of ESIARD-1 has been must revaiding in
erms.of his contacts, travel, and future plans, This information
has been of interest to Headquarters, LIFEAT has exerted every effort
to provide continuing coverage of this target even when ESLARD-1
resided in a hotel under ‘an alias and following his move to new
quarters, Coverage by-LIFEAT was especially difficult during E-l'e
stay at the hotel since the tectinical problems were considerable and
‘the processing of all calls to and from the hotel in order to extract
E-1's calls was a heavy burden on the LIFEAT processor/translator
staff, “It is noted that in Station's opinion the LIFEAT complex
showed up particularly well in this assignment,

i LIFEAT coverage or[ jnas been especially
fruitful concerning thé travel and contacts of Costa Rican Communists,
including their travel to Cuba, It has also provided some leads
concerning ZRKNICK operation,

(6) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico {ACGM) - During the reporting|
period local ODENVY requested that LIFEAT coverage be initiated on
David DRUCKER, prominent member of the ACOM. Product from this |
coverage, in conjunction with that coverage already being provided
on Charles SMALL (ake SHOLIKOFF), 13 velvable to ODENVY in providing
data_on U.S, Communists who travel to Kexico and contact the xembers
of the ACCM, Information 1s also provided on the daily activities
and contacts of members of the ACCH, :

(7) LIFEAT/Uscellaneous - Coverage of a former SMOTH agent at the
request of Headquarters resulted in the kmowledge that this former
agent was in contact vith a number of Soviet Satellite personalities
and was exerting a strong influence on a friend of his, a PAPRIME |
citizen employed as the local representative of a well mown PBPRIME
news media, It became apparent that the PEPRIME citizen, through
his connection with the news media, was peing encouraged by the forzer
SMOTH agent in an attempt to “destroy” the senior QDACID official ~
in Mexico, Early warning to this official resulted in action which
greatly diminished the effect ‘of this effort, Coverage of both the |
former SMOTH agent and the PEPRIME citizen is being continued,

LIFEAT coverage was also placed on the, private office of a

Due to the heavy workload chared by the present LIFEAT processor/
translater staff. it was decided that an additionalagent was needed

' for-these duties, Station review of a numver os agent candidates to

fill this position was unsrtaxen and one individual was selected.
See paragraph 2 C below.

‘PERSONS

‘Provisfonsl operational approval was requested on LIFEUD-28 on 29 Hay

“1963 to fill the need noted in paragraph 2 B above, Recruitment will

be undertaien when such approval is received,
ti x sl was called into the ‘offices of

the | and told that since’he has

passed the retirenent age (LIMEUD-1 is 63 years old) “room mst be
made for younser men", A retirement payment was sgreed upon which, when
all benefits are included, equals toe approximately 70 to 80 percent of

LIFEWD-1's base sal. After the retirement plan wes agreed upon,
the epee aeecter meaeatd tn a private conversition, asked LIFEXD-1
to accept a spec! commission as part-time investigator conserned

with adeinistrative personnel at 1,000 pesos per month, LIFEUD-1
accepted this ccaniission.

‘The above action will reduce LIFEUD-1's access to the

where most LIFEAT tap| were made, The extent o! 8
reduction can only be determined after LIFEUD-1 works his special
conmission for a period of time. As & preliminary opinion, end not
a final decision, it is believed that LIFEUD-2's knowledge of and contacts
in the coupled with his new position as personnel
investigator, will continue to make his contribution to the LIFEAT
project valuable and possibly unique. (See paragraph 2 E below re
security aspects of LIFEUD-1's retirement),

LIAISON

In late Fay 1963 local ODENVY requested coverage be instituted on

David DAtCKER, ODENVY is to process the take as an other ACGY coverages,
This coverase was installed 2 June 1963, No other change from that
noted in reference (b).

TTY

@) In tie security area the rettrerent of LIFEUD-1 and the events
surrounding it have produced two dangers to the operation which
effect both security and efficiency, The first of these involves
the reduction of LIFSAT access to the Formerly
LIFED-1 sould, by calling the arrange
for LIFHD-16 to ente J and while engaged in norral work
there emtsblish a tap] on a LIFFAT target line, Tapping
throug: el] is not always possible, but has become the standard
method used in LIFAT operations, It 1s censidered less time con~
suing and somewhat more secure than tapping throush

Secondly, LIFEUD-1, prior to retirement, c: ckstop
presence of the LIFEAT (LIFEUD-2 and LIFEUD-3) in areas of the

city outside their normal work areas while these agents worked on the
LIFEUD-1's retirenent diminishes

LIFSA: access to the and removes the “protection” LIFEUD-1
provided to the [[

. Ins related incident during a discussion of his retirement
with LIFECD-2, it becaze apparent that ie believed that LICGACH wes
providing backup protection to the entire LIFEAT complex, LIFEUD=1
based this assumption on the fact that at one time he had discussed
provicing LiT=AT with high level protection with a former LIFEAT Case
Officer end later learned that this Case Officer had visited LICOACH
on a mxber of occasions, From this LIFE™D-1 deduced that LICOACH _
was in contact with the former LIFEAT Case Officer in order to

had any dealings with LICOACH other then during some investigations
which LIFFUD-1 conducted for the approxinately
nine years ago. At no time has LIFUD-1 nentionéd LIF=AT operations
~ -to LICGACH. Since LICOACH returned to lus -native Western European
country 1 June 1963, LIFEUD-1 will not be told that LICOACH was not
\ in LIFEAT erploy, Howwver, LIFEUD-1 has been reminded never to
