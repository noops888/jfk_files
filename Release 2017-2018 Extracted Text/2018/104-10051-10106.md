[Be State Department reviewed WISE's file on 2 June 195k; and as of
September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the American
Fnbassy in Moscow. At that time WISE advised in a cable to the State
Department _ Eee

ite ‘DAVIS' case is very similar to that of
OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, lived in the Soviet Union for two years
