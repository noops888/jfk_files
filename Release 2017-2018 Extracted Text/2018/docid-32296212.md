on 6/12/61 SA THOMAS @. FORSYTH, III observed a 1960 Plymouth
Fury sedan, black bottom and white top, Florida license # 1w22076,
parked in the driveway of GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage, RD #3,
, near Leechburg, Pa. It is noted that the above license was
7 previously furnished incorrectly to Miami as 1402276.

(i on 6/12/61 FG 615-C and PCI HERBERT LEE RAY advised SA FORSYTH:

Gambling in New Kensington, Pa., remains very slow, much to the
distress of the MANNARINOS and their underlings. Gamblers are
frequently heard to opine that after the General Elections in

November, 1961, the MANNARINOs will be able to "get to” the ¢
new Mayor and thinge will open up again.

SAMUEL. and GABRIEL MANNARINO, when in town, continue to eat lunch almod
daily at the Bonfire Restaurant, Leechburg Road, Allegheny Township,
Westmoreland County, Pa., and they invariably bring visitors and Sey
guests to this establishment. J

aay

Miami will obtain holder of Florida license # 1w22076.
BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
