Gambling in New Kensington, Pa., remains very slow, much to the

distress of the MANNARINOs and

their underlings.

Gamblers are

frequently heard to opine that after the General Elections in

November, 1961, the MANNARINOs w1ll be able to "get to" the

new Mayor and thinge will open up again.

SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO, when in town, continue to eat lunch almos

dally at the Boniire restaurant, Leechburg Road, Allegheny Township,.

Westmoreland County, Pa., and they invariably bring visitors and

guests to this establishment.

Miami will obtain holder of Florida I1cense # IW22076.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
