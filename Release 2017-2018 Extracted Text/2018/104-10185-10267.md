Algo.ncluded in the mail sacks were & nunber of envelopes

L-9 was surprised not to receive an .nvitation to.the French

Enbassy on Hastille Day this year, He feels that it was just an
‘oversight or that the French merely invited the Counselora and

left out the Attaches, Because of mis language qualifications he
is usually much in demand at the French Embassy,

seems’ to be very friendly with Cuban officials in Veracruz.

Le9 turned over a nunber of ‘carbon copies of reports he has prepare .o>

Habana and for the Ambaseador, These will be filed with this CR, It is interesting
to note how he reported on the recent, Soviet art exhibition, which he told B he
considered terrible and without any artistic merit whatever, His report to te

artists that their work reach the masses," etc,, etc, A fine snow Job, Judging

Bookstore on Reforma Lorias,- The meeting lasted from 2115 to 2220 hours in Bis cars ;

Le9 reported a9 follows: .

Three or four couriers were in the Bnbassy and one told L-9 on the
morning of 21 July that he was very tired because he couldn't sieep
the night before, L-9 felt that this may have indicated that the
ian was working aroun’ the Embasey that nicht, (B later phoned

-,.NIARCHOS and ‘arranged for LIOMEN not to he lit off the next day),

“Subsequent information revealed to the Station that these were d. :.0 :

On 19 July Le9 went to Texcoco to officiate at the awarding of tie

On 20 July Dra, MACHADO told L-9 that she was going to leave Mexico,

"She pointed to the Anb's office, said,"I can't take any more from that

‘man in there — the only thing he is interested in is buttering up
GOROSTIZA (the Foreign Minister)"

On 20 July L-9 was visiting the Taller de Grafica Pcpular and spied

to ses him in Cuba soon, - This letter, flap usesled, was delivered to L-9 by
Manuel VEQA who, of course, read it, L-S felt that Teresa's careful wording,
making the whole matter look 4 bit mysterious, was good in that it helped maintain
the aura of mystery about hin, He felt, however, that in view of the late date he

cae - "a, A weekly staff nesting was held the previous Saturday,
: 30 May ~~ the first in over a month,

be At the Staff mecting the Ambessador preised Aparicio
. for having been elected as "Yocal = Zona del Caribe”
ei : at a recent AMOOSAC meeting, (L-9 aaid that these AMOOSAC
eed . “meetings are a farce, great mabers of Nicarsguans, Cubans,
o+ ae _ . etesy turn out and pretend they are important while most
: of the diplomats in town who really deserve the title stay
at home or do something worthvhile), ‘The Ambassador told
ve : those at the staf? meeting that Aparioio's election ws a
great, honor for Ciba but that-he felt that an apology to the
- Exbassy staff was in order since the staff as a body should
have met before Aparioic accerted the nomination since this
is the démocratic way of doing things -- the socialist way.
"Afterall, " said the Ambassador, "let us suppose Aparicio
were to be sent to sows other Embassy in two months, then
Cuba would lose this important AMCOSAC position," (L-9
ate. -found in this remark a faint hint that Aparicio might be
se ehendad acmorhera_olae)..

ae _ . :@» The Ambassador praised the Cultural Departaent for ite fine

. work and told of a letter. which had been received fren the

seer ~Stesa“¢ ‘de las Americas: telling of the’ good work of the Cultural
Departnait, Aparicio began to brag ebont all he had done and
took all the credit 20 L-9, feigning anger, spoke up and re~
narked that he had done‘his share — then began to enumerate
his contributions and took Aparicio to task for hogging the
limelight, . (L-9 explained that he finds it 2 good idea to

" bark like this now and then and then retreat back into hie

“shell and be "manso” mtil tine to assert himself again).

CASTRO's intervention when Raul POA tried to get L-9 transferred
out of Mexico about a year ago, CASTRO said to ROA: "If L-9 is
doing a good job there in Neaico, why are you taking him away?"
This ended the matter as ROA naturally agreed with Fidel. (I~9
heard ‘exactly ‘the sane version of the conversation sone tine ago

Meeting vith LITAML<°,. 16 dan 6s i

Ts c.A‘meeting ves beta ith L-9 en the night of. 16 Jan. Pickeup was
made at the corer of Reforma and Altai (Lomas) and Le was driven to the
- vicinity ef.the recently acquired safe spartnent which will be used for this

. . operaticn inthe future, whe he Icarned that the meeting would be held in
an apartment he got a bad caso cf*nerves, said "I don't like this ona bit,"
and carié verg close to refusing, Rarker finally convinced him that this one
meeting should be held there and that if, after talking things over, L-?
did not feel safe there the place vould not be used for further meetings.

. B.entered the safe ayarirent at 2017 and L«$ showed up at 2016, By this time
he was almost shaking, .Fexirring ty reminding L-9-that the two had elwaye
worked together vell by being perfectly frank and open with cach other, B
proposed that L-& state his reasons for being afraid of holding meetings in
@ safe apartment, after vhich B would state his reasons in favor of the
proposition, at the end of which L-9 would be allowed to decide whether the
spartment should be used in the future.

2. Le9 ranblsd all ever the wap, referred to his nany meetings with
his earlier C/O Shrycck, eoretinen two or three in one dayy eaid he had
absolute confidence in B, but didn't trust other people, etc., eto, The
reasons for his allercy to sefehouses did not tecare evident so B began his
spiel and held forth on the good points of the new meeting place == Le and
B would never be together except behind these walls -~ could not be seen
together «= a cover story for.ase cf the apartment explained to the portera
B'e presence (she could be cocnted on to spread it around a bit)s there are
two good locking voren livin: in other apartments in the same building which
could explain L-S's havicg entered if anyone knowing him were to see him go
in (he is a bachelor); the 7
not know Bta-nare cr. iden
house, etce, etc. L-9 acknevledzed this but repeated his statement that
he doesn't trust other pecplé, Then it finally cane out, he was under the
