3. It is realized that an operational progress report and a contact

report are two different items; however, in view of the detailed nature of

the LITANILy CO's the Station has felt that their submission has satisfied

the requirements of operational reporting. The criticism of reference s

all the mure puzzling since auch visitors to the Station as Chester D.

bainold, Chief, Wise; corton A. Wolley,

ersturile Chiet of Operations, wid;

ünd Thomas l. Lund, present lexic. Branch Chief, have ill expressed their

approval of the detalled operational reporting on this speration durtes

visite thes have made to the Station at which time the reports in questlen

have neen brought to ther attention.

4.

Whea LITANIS next extts PiRai, the Staülon will begin to

prepare formal sperational progress reports on the operation.

As for the questions raised in paragraph 2 of reference resarding

operationai securliy, advance infornation on AMANTL-O's recall cane froz

IDS:OK but he was not Inforned of the irminence of hls.transfer untli 1t

was reported routinely by LInkill? ard kus ¿enerally mown by his collis

As for the implication that LITANIlmy was Informed of the Station's

capability to interiapt smuassy telephore conversatiens,

reading of the lemorandu: under critique sill show that no such aliciovie

ledgement sas nase, LIPAlIty was informed that "e have a zoad chance

of being told abust such a conversazion by wie of our friends," l.e, that

word will probably et around in Smbussy circles that IIPANIlay 1s about

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM! Lawrence f. farter

SUBJECT.&

Meeting with LITAMIL?, I6 Jan 6l

I, A meetirg was held with In? on the night of 16 Jan. Pick ip was

made at the corner of Poforia and Altal (Lonas) and In was driven to the

vicinity of the recently amuired safe apartment which will be uned for this

operation in the futur.

kher he irarned that the neeting would be held in

an apartment he got a bad case of'nerves, said "I don't like this one bit,"

and came very close to refusing. Rorker finally convinced him that this one

meeting should be held there and that 1f, after tallang things over, I9

did not feel sale there the place rould not be used for lurther meetings.

B. entered the safe ajartrent at 2017 and If showed up at 2046. By this time

ho was almost shaking. Serring by reminding If that the two had always

worked together well by beirs perfortly frank and open with each other; B

proposed that Iny state his resons for being afraid of holding mectinga in

a safe apartment,

after which B would state his reasons in favor of the

propositiong

at the cid of which In? would be allowed to docide whether the

apartment should be used in the future,

2e Ing rambled all ever the rap, referred to his many meetingo with

his earller C/O Shryock, soretired two or three in one days said he had

absolute confidence in B, but didn't trust other people, etce eto. The

reasons for his allerey to safehousog did not becare evident so B began his

spled and held forth on the ipod prints of the new meetirg place - In and

B would never be together except whind these wally could not be seen

together an a cover story for use of the apartrent explained to the portera

B's presence (she could be counted on to spread 1t around a bit.), there aro

tro good looking women Iiving in ither apartments in the same building which

could explain In!'s harirs entered if anyone knowing him were to seo him go

In (he 1a a bachelor), the perser fros than the apartment is oub-leased does

not know Ble name er 1derlies) Big ca: would never ke parked in front of the

houso,.etcog etc.

Ing acinewledged all this but repeated his statement that

he doesn't

trust other peccle.

Then it finally case out, he was under the

Impression that the apartuest has to be used by B for reeting numerous other

agents . apparently he cou's not concelve of our obtaining an apartment to

use for meeting one lone agent. As soon as he was assured that he was the

coly agent wo would be sat there he calmed down and relaxed noticeably. In

his mind's oye he had bona secing a penetration agent point out the apartment

and causing it to be watched by ch opposition tich would eventually catch

1»9 going 1n. L-9 required E's assurances three different times during the

meeting that other persens boild not be met there.

This caused B to deliver

a short course on court niation and show If that we would considor 1t

folly to meet nore than coe agent in the naro place. (For the record, 1t

ahould be noted that agent DURIP nay be net thare fron tire to tina = 1t

1s not planned that the apartment will be aposed to any other assota).

3o Ing explained that he vould bama to love by 2200 hourg since be had

to go to 10 aliquri to seet an iraned tolia timiciao
