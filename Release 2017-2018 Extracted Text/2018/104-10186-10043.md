‘STATE

A former Cuban IS efficer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964.

Although there are many members of the Direccion General de
Inteligencia (General Directorate of Intelligence + DGI) who
appear interested in and favorable toward:the Communist ‘Party,
Source knows of only three persons who are actually members:
Saul GONZALEZ, alias“Denis"; Manuel VEGA Perez, alias “Marcos
Viera", and Felix SUAREZ, alias “Federico Santiesteban".
SUAREZ was a sert cf political adviser in the DGI operations
departments, but insisted he was not a commissar, but, rather,
2 person in charge. Although Source and the other officers
would tease SUAREZ by calling him “Comisario", SUAREZ greatly
resented the term and actually ‘physically attacked Source for
doing so. Every Saturday morning at 8:30, SUAREZ held a
pelitical indoctrinition meeting which all personnel were
suppesed te attend Source was habitually late to these
sessions, and althcugh he was given penalties for his obvious
disaffection, he never paid any attention to them. The DGI
personnel Source knew were perfectly willing to talk politics
among themselves but in a rather desultory way; the discussions
never went on very long.

Apparently during 1962, there had been considerable sentiment
for Anibal ESCALANTE and his faction, the Partido Socialista
Pepular (PSP), but in 1964 the PSP group was disrupted and
the real loyalty was to Fidel CASTRO rather than to the Party.
