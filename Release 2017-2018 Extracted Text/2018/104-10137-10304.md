8. Gerald Patrick IIEMMING is well known to this
the Office of Security Miami Ficld Office, and JNNAVE
Duewcdtis Secuslons ‘sinc. at least the daily 1360's
claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has be
none. The most recent incident wherein HENMING claimed su
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his servi
to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Gerald Patrick HMM
isa long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SFI353 459),
aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falscly claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HENNING and STURGIS, both former U.S, Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
Claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Conmunist. Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers.of whom have never been fully established) was
naned the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plet
sinvolving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
and an extract from a. book published in early 1976 written by
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John” F, Kennedy
“Is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency
with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr, to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to. Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti
‘nental Penetration Force, Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
sand that members of this unit were connected with CIA, . GARRISON
‘shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
cinteresting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
