Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is well known to this Agancy,

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

"to the Drug Enforcemont Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMINO

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF353 459) ,

Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

long-time record of

falsely

claiming Agency affiliation.

the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba

but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

SURGIs organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Conmunist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"

(the backers. of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

For an appreciation of the

possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan

government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant

memorandum, to wit:

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;

and an extract from a book published in carly 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'etat

In America--The ClA and the Assassination of John F.

is a diatribe against the Agency

and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY.

One of the major

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugone

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

mental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

GARRISON

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL,

but it is

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick

HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
