SAMUEL M. GIANCANA, aka

"JUNE"

Review of information available in the Chicago files

indicates that the situation between SAM GIANCANA and PHYLLIS

MC GUIRE is at a point where MC GUIRE might readily discuss

her past relationship with GIANCANA with Bureau Agents. U

From information received from PCI BEN SWIFT and

PCI LOWELL WILLIAMSON, It Is evident that MC GUIREhe

for the

Last several months, heeded the request of her sisters to

discontinue seeing GIANCANA. U

A highly confidential

source in the Chicago Division

advised that during the week of 12/1/63, GIANCANA, during a

telephonic conversation with PHYLLIS MC GUIRE, was highly

berated and insulted by MC GUIRE on that occasion. This

source has furnished other information recently to the effect

that this phone call was not an isolated incident and in tactel/

MC GUIRE, has on several recent occasions, told off GIANCANA

Bureau permission is requested to have Agents of the

New York Division,

familiar with GIANCANA's activities, interview

MC GUIRE to determine her degree of cooperativeness in learning

of

activities of which she is aware concerning GIANCANA/(
