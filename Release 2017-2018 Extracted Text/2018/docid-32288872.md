‘Re your airtel 12/2/03. (U)

Inasmuch as Phyllis McGuire has proved uncooperative in

Bureau and Chicago of the results, following which Chicago should
submit a further recommendation concerning the daterview. 0)

SUBJECT: SAMUEL M. GIANCANA, aka

AR

Review of information available in the Chicago files
indicates that the situation between SAM GIANCANA and PHYLLIS :
MC GUIRE is at a point where MC GUIRE might readily discuss rae
her past relationship with GIANCANA with Bureau agents.(/))

From information received from PCI BEN SWIFT and :
PCI LOWELL WILLIAMSON, it is evident that MC GUIRE for the
last several months, heeded fhe request of her sisters to
discontinue seeing grancana.(US

A highly confidential source in the Chicago Division
advised that. during the week of 12/1/63, GIANCANA, during a
telephonic conversation with PHYLLIS MC GUIRE, was highly
berated and insulted by MC GUIRE on that occasion. This
source has furnished other information recently to the effect
that this phone call was not an isolated incident and in fact, Ya
MC GUIRE, has on several recent occasions, told off GIANCANA, ib

Bureau permission is requested to have Agents of (thé
New York Division, familiar with GIANCANA's activities, intervie

MC GUIRE to determine her degree of cooperativeness in learning i
of activities of which she is aware concerning GIANCANA, d)
