callf

"HELEN" is probably HELEN/GRECO, widow of "SPIKE"

JONES, the musician.

Miss BETSY DUNCAN, former PCI, advised

that HELEN GRECO iS

a very respectable person who was married

to JONES for nearly twenty years.

She has a home in the

Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills, an area of very expensive

homes.

DUNCAN said that she has heard that GRECO and ROSELLI

are going to get married in October, 1965; that GRECO is

going to sell her home and they are going to buy a lot and

build a home of their own.

DUNCAN then said that she does

not believe that GRECO will marry ROSELLI; that GRECO is aware

of ROSELLI's background and that she thinks GRECO has more

common sense than to marry ROSELLI.

DIANE PALEY, former Bookkeeper for Automatic Shine

Company, Incorporated,

was interviewed on 3/4/65.

She recalls

when she first went to work for this company in January, 1965,

that on one occasion RoSElLt came to the office with EMANUEL

ROTHMAN, who was one of the directors of the company. She said

that this is the only time she has seen ROSELLI. She sala

that it is her opinion, through her work at this company, for call

about three months, that ROSELLI does not have, or did not have-

an interest in the company.

She said that ALBERT BRODKIN, who

was the president, was an

extremely poor businessman and some-

thing of a

"con"

man; that he never paid any bills unless

forced to and was working all of the time on borrowed money;

that he was a man of little principle who would lie whenever

it suited his interests and that he did not seem to have

sufficient ability to successfully manage a business.

Trustee"

Examination of the bank account, "EMANUEL ROTHMAN,

3 at the Union Bank, Los Angeles, which account has

seen used extensively in the past to handle financial trans-

actions of Rosalul, reflects that on 7/2/05 a check for $2,500

was paid to MAURICE FRIEDMAN. A notation on the face of the

check set out' Repayment of one half of principal balance of

5/3/65 loan.

The check was deposited to some account at the

Fidelity Bank, Mar Vista, California.

Contact with this

bank failed to reflect that FRIEDMAN

has an account at this

bank.

Eiforts are being made to trace the account to which

the check was deposited.
