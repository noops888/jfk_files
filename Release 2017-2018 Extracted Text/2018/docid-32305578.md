"HELEN" is probably HELEN GRECO, widow of "SPIKE"
JONES, the musician, Miss BETSY DUNCAN, former PCI, advised
that HELEN GRECO is a very respectable person who was married
to JONES fér nearly twenty years. She has a home in the
Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills, an area of very expensive
homes. DUNCAN said that she has heard that. GRECO and ROSELLI
are going -to get married in October, 1965; that GRECO is
going to sell her home and they are going to buy a lot and
build a home of their own, DUNCAN then said that she does
not believe that GRECO will marry ROSELLI; that GRECO is aware
of ROSELLI's background and that she thinks GRECO has more
common sense than to marry ROSELLI.

DIANE PALEY, former Bookkeeper for Automatics Shine

Company, Incorporated, was interviewed on 8/4/65. Shé recalls

at. on one occasion ROSELLI came to the office with EMANUEL
OTHMAN, who was one of the directors of the company. She said

pe she first went to work for this company in January, 1965,

that this is the only time she has seen ROSELLI. She said

that it is her opinion, through her work at this co ipany,for dz
about three months, that ROSELLI does not have, orfaid not have
an interest in the company. She said that ALBERTABRODKIN, who
was the president, was an extremely poor businessman and some-
thing of a "con" man; that he never paid any bills unless

forced to and was working all of the time on borrowed money;

that he was a man of: little principle who would lie whenever

it suited his interests and that he did not seem to have
sufficient ability to successfully manage a business.

Examination of the bank account, "EMANUEL ROTHMAN,
Trustee", at the Union Bank, Los Angeles, which account has
been used extensively in the past to handle financial trans-
actions of ROSELLI, reflects that on 7/2/65 a check for .$2,500
was paid to MAURICE FRIEDMAN, A notation og the facé of the
check set out' Repayment of one half of principal balance of
5/3/65 loan." The check .was deposited to some account at the
Fidelity Bank, Mar Vista, California. Contact with this
bank failed to reflect that FRIEDMAN has an account at this
bank. Efforts are being made to trace the account to which
the check was deposited,
