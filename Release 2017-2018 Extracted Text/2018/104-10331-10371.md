Subject: Status of ARRB decision on 16 documents

1. As of COB Friday, no official word if the DO is

going to appeal or not. Bill McNair called late Friday and

ask for set of the documents apparently they did not keep a

set when

took them over).

Told him OGC had a set; we

preparing

set for him to pick-up this a.m.

2. The decision date to notify President of "appeal" is

COB Wed. If needed Bob Eatinger,

occ, will call kristov,

White House Counsel's Office, and ask for more time. Either

way, we need dar package for the DCI ready no later then

early Tue.

3. Attached are notes on the 16 documents prepared by

Chuck Briggs.

I basically agree with his comments, however,

the only

'appeal issue" is names.

Inactive crypts that do

not identity an agent/asset or a liaison relationship should

be released. Writing in substitutions or codes would be a

major undertaking.

4. The names in these 16 documents can probably be

released with no harm provided the individual are notified;

they are part of the story.

However,

this collections

contains hundreds of names of included who served/retired

under cover. Even if these 16 documents are released in

full the WH

should be notified that we will be appealing

future releases of names of such individuals.

Barry,

Re-reviewing the 16 documents which the ARRB says

should be released in full led me to the following (see the

attached for my rationale):

Agree with Release in Full (RIF) : 8

RIF if retiree over status is changeable:

2

RIF if ARRB will not accept substitute code

for crypts:

5

Continue sanitized release, protecting

pseudonym: 1

The substitute suggestion for crypts applies to

documents #7,

17, 18, 19, and 21.

The pseudo protection

argument applies

to

document #5; it also applies to #19

except that Bob Shaw has surfaced his CIA connection himself

although the DO insisted on his being our hold list.

Bob

was a minor major player in the file and should be told that

his name

needs to

be released.

In this unique JFK law instance (and with the many

cryptonym identifications in the public domain, whether

official, inadvertent, by Agee or conspiracy butfs), the

best tactic to ensure credibility and ARRB cooperation in

protecting truly sensitive information would seem to be to

release Mexico City crypts if the ARRB is adamant.
