2. Another report from the(DEVIGIi]Center in Genoa (No, 14204
of 3 December 1964) states that from thé afternoon of 26 November
1964 until the following morning AMWHIP/1 and Identity A shared a

They left Italy on the afternoon of 27 Noveaber at Ponte, S$. Luigi.

AMWHIP/) left Rome tor an unknown destination. Identity A left

which departed at 0950 hours tor Paris. ol

4, During a meeting of 11 December 1964 with (bevaciL/27)
BUNCE mentioned the presence of AMWHIP/1 in Italy such a way
as to suggest that we had known about it all along but that it was
merely a pleasure trip, In point of fact, however, AMWHIP/1 did

not get in touch with SMITHAM or BUNCE during his 28 to 39 November

stay in Rome,

5. On 10 December 1964 AMWHIP/2 telephoned BUNCE's home from
his store here, and arrangements were made for BUNCE to pick him
up there the following evening because AMNHIP/2 wanted to take BUNCE §
and wife to dinner, When BUNCE arrived on 11 Docember, ASWHIP/1
was also at the store. BUNCE talked with ANWHIP/1 for ten minutes,
during which time AMMHIP/1 mentioned that he hoped to xo to Paris
about 15 December 1964 and then to New York bul made no mention of
his earlier visit to Rome, BUNCE then asked him iQgmtpplimy if he

“ at the store in the’ morning. In this way, he explained, he first

“ AMWHIP/2 answered that he does not think so, He said that Identity A

arlier., AMWHIP/1 said that
prised because he had

for two days and nights in a
ing quite flustered, AMWHIP,/1

had aot been in Rome one to two weeks
he liad not. BUNCE said that he vas
information that ASWHIP/I had sta
hotel on the Piazza Barberini. Le.
said that he could not understar. x this fact had slipped his
mind, Of course he had been here! BUNCE pointed out that the
coverage here in Rome is obviously efficient and that he should
bear this fact in mind. AMWHIP;1 repeated that he could not
understand how he had forgotten his prior visit. The remainder
ofthe brief conversation was cordial,

"6, En route to BUNCE's quarters BUNCE asked AMWHIP/2 whether
AMWHIP/1 had told him about a visit made ten days to two weeks
earlier, A\WHIP/2 said that AMWEIP- 2 had not divulged this trip
until the preceding evening, 10 Ntwember 1964. He said that he 4
then learned that_AMWHIP/1 had beez accompanied By his mistress, /
Identity A, AMWHIP/2 lamented the relationship. He said that
some time ago he had called AMWHIP “I's New York apartment on
business and had been told by his wife to try to reach AMWHIP/1

learned that even in New York AMWHIP/1 sleeps with Identity A rathe
than at home. He said that Identity A has AMWHIP/1 completely
under her thumb, BUNCE-asked whether he considered it possible

or even probable that AMSHIP/1 discusses his work for us (i.e.,
KUBARK) With Identity A. AMWHIP,2 said that he was positive he
tells her everything, He said, "I am not just 99% sure of this. ||
I am 100% sure." He added that AMVHIP/1 also confides in

Identity A all details about their various business transactions,

7. BUNCE asked whether AMAHIP’2 has any reason to suspect
that Identity A works for the PBRCWEN IS or has any other connections,
direct or indirect, through which information which she obtains
from AMWHIP/1 might be relayed to the PBRUMEN IS or government,

is not a Communist and is anti-AMTHUG, He also described her as
stupid,

8. Although AMWHIP/2 did not place restrictions upon our use
of this information, BUNCE does not know how widely known is either
the AMWHIP,’1-Identity A relationship or the éxtent of AMWHIP/1's
disclosures to Identity A, It may be that if AMWHIP/1 were
confronted directly with this matter and charged with insecurity,
he would spot AMWHIP/2 as the source of our information, This
possibility is strengthened by the fact that immediately after
BUNCE brought up AMWHIP/1's visit to Rome, AMAHIP/2 and BUNCE left
to spend the evening together, as AXM*HIP/1 knows. What action,
4f any, should be taken in respect to AMWHIP/1 is plainly a matter
for Headquarters decision, It is requested, however, that action
which would tend to pinpoint AMAHIP "2 as the source of our infor-+
mation be avoided, It is also requested that we be advised of the

action taken, 41 any,

9. Further information supplied by AMWHIP/2 is being reported
separately,
