During a meeting of ll December 1961 with DEVIGIL/27

BUNCE mentioned the presence of AJWulP/1 in Italy in such a was

as to suggest that we had known about it all along but that it was

merely a pleasure trip.

In point of lact, however.

AWWHIP/l did

not get in touch with

SMITHAN Or BUNCE during his 28 to 30 November

stay in Rome.

On 10 December 1964 ANNHIP/2 telephoned BUNCE's home from

his store here,

and arrangements were made for BUNCE to pick him

up there the following evening because AJWHIP/2 wanted to take BUNCE

and wife to dinner.

When BUNCE arrived on 11 Docember, ANNHIP/1

was also at the store.

BUNCE talked with AN HIP/1 for

ten minutes,

during which time ANNHIP/l mentioned that he hoped to to to Paris

about 15 December 1961 and then to New York but made no mention of

his earlier visit to Rome. BUiCE then asked him iogether is he

some time ago he had called ANWRIP.'l's New York apartment on

business and had been told by his wife to try to

In this way, he explained, he first

learned that even in New York AMBIP/l sleeps with Identity A rathe

He said that Identity A has AbWHIP/1 completely

BUNCE asked whetzer he considered it possible

Although AJWHIP/2 did not place restrictions upon our use

of this information,

BUNCE does nor know how widely known is either

the ANNHIP/l-Identity A relationship or the extent of AMHIP/1's

disclosures to Identity A.

It may be that if AMNHIP/1 were

confronted directly

with this matter and charged with insecurity,

spot ANHIP/2 as the source of our information.

possibility is strengthened by the fact that immediately after

BUNCE brought up AMWHIP/1's visit to Rome, AXAHIP/2 and BUNCE left

to spond the evening together, as AX HIP/l knows.

What action,

1f any, should be taken in respect to SHIP/l is plainly a matter

for Headquarters decision.

It is requested, however, that action

which would tend to pinpoint AMllP? as the source of our infor

It is also requested that we be advised of the
