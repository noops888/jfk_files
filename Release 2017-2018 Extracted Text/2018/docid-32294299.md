The accounting firm of FERNANDEZ Y FERNANDEZ of

Marianao, Cuba, according to Dr.

LOPEZ, was the firn that

had performed the accounting operations for the Sans

Soci Night Club up until 1958, at which time he vaguely

recalled

sone of the bookkeeping duties of this

firm may

have been taken over by the Consultorio Fernandez. This

was all that Dr. LOPEZ stated he knew of the accounting

operations of the Sans Souci.

DI LOPEz advised he knows nothing about the

subject's present or future plans, stating he has had no

legal contact with the subject since subject's departure

from Cuba in 1959.

C. GENERAL ACTIVITIES AT TAMPA, FLORIDA, TO LOCATE SUBJECT

On December 5, 1961, subject's daughter MARY JOSEPHINE

PANIELLO was observed at Henry Grady School and on the same

afternoon, subject's daughter, SARAH ANN TRAFFICANTE, waS

observed at 2505 Bristol Avenue.

On December 5, 1961, Dr. ANTHONY PERZIA, Citizens

Building, advised SA JOHN R. BRETT that he saw JIMMY LONGO

in theColumbia Restaurant a week ago, Saturday, at which

time he asked LONGO where SANTO was and LONGO said he was

in Miami.

He has not seen TRAFFICANTE in a long time and

can furnish nothing further as to his location.

He last examined TRAFFICANTE on March 22, 1961,

and gave hin a prescription which he knows he had filled

with MAX CASTRO in Miami.

He believes CASTRO's place is

called the Union Optical Co. and SANTO had several pairs of

glasses made there. When asked why he would have several

pairs, he said he likes a lot of different kinds of glasses,

some dark glasses, some plain, some with bifocals, some

without the bifocals, pink glasses, etc. He said he had had

some contact lenses made when he was in Cuba and thinks he

had the examination for these made in Cuba.*

He is near

needing bifocals, too.

DI. PERZIA had no further nformation

of value.

Bar, 2801-05 Nebraska Avenue and the new vehicle that

was observed at 2505 Bristol Avenue,

Yarborough, Inc., used car dealer, Miami, Florida, was still

observed in the garage at 2505 Bristol Avenue.

TP T-1

advised SA BENJAMIN H. COOKE on Degember 6,

1961, that he was personally acquainted with the subjeet

on several occasions in the past, he has been a guest of

the subject on the subject's yacht when it was anchored near

Havana, Cuba, during the BATISTA days in Cuba.

that the last information that he had concerning the

subject was that the subject

is now residing in the keys off

Florida, in the vicinity of Key West. Source stated the

subject is supposed to have a home there and to be living

there using the name LOUIS SANTOS, which is also the name

that the subject

used when he registered in a notel while

he was attending the "Apalachin meeting" in New York State

several years ago. Source then noted that he did not care

to discuss the matter of the subject any further.

Captain ELLIS CLIFTON, Vice Squad, Hillsborough

County Sheriff's Office, advised SA LIONEL E. BELANGER on

December 6, 1961, that subject's whereabouts was unknown to

him and his sources.

TP T-2 advised on December 6, 1961, that no

information

developed that subject was in Tampa, and noted

that source was with SAM TRAFFICANTE, NICK SCAGLIONE and

JIMMY BRUNO at the Palm Service Station on December 6,

1961. Source further noted that he was with such persons as

establishments as Crystal Bar, 1209 N. Gall Blvd.,

on the Ocean at 25tl St. The envelope apparently contained

a letter from the Manager, GEORGE CASPER of the Promenade

Hotel noting "It is with a great deal of pride that I can

write and tell you of my appointment as Managot of the

Promenade..."

Apparently Mr. SANTO TRAFFICANTE had been a

previous customer to Mr. CASPER.
