heme in the Camp Columbia Hqs, Raul and Cubela were surprised while |
making obvious homosexual advances toward one another. Cubela later |

due to his unsatisfactory performance as a student leader or whether
he had had a "Lover's Quarzel" with Raul. Source: Latin American
revolutionary who lived in Cuba until August 1962 and Personally met
high Cuban officials. (Ed Note: Perhups his performance as one-half

of the homosexual tean was unsatisfactory! !?)

| Tais report called him an individual without principles or scruples,
reedy, ambitious, and one who would betray the regime without qualms
i Should it suit his own interests. OPS #1139. (Ed Note: We must have
put this report out, for another card said the following: Among his j
victims were Miguel Angel QUEVEDO y Lastra, the former editor of the
weekly magazine BOHEMIA (now in exile in ‘the us. and! working for us; i
however, it is true that QUEVEDO is and was openly known to be a
homosexual, and one Dr, Cardenas, fnu, Chief Surgeon of the University
Hospital. However, it appears to the editor that source is speaking
of Dr. Armando de Cardenas Aranguren, a pathologist who admitted
homosexual relations with Cubela during an interrogation by SIM after
the killing of Lt. Col. Antonio BLANCO Rico. However, there is no
doubt that Cerdenas still considered himself a friend to Cubela and
as late as 1961 was trying to help get Cubela out of Cuba; this would
hardly be true if Cubela had been blackmailing him for years. There
are other indications that they appear to be good friends. In any case,
this type of blackmail could work both ways - the individuals con-
cerned could put the same charge against the blackmailer, no?)
December 1960: Following derog info subject: Gained prominence FEU
(Federacion Estudiantil Univrs?: tario) through Raul Castro. Common
knowledge that he sold out morally and Poltically to Raul. Subject
actually shared quarters with Raul and much talk of homo relationships.
Subject became sort of mediator between Cowmie and anti-Commie groups
in University of Havana after January 1959. But soon his lack of. \
character and political force became known and Raul forced him upon -

Cubela went to Mexico to represent Fidel Cestro at the exercises or
the graduating class of the School of Political and Social Sciences
