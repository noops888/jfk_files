Cubela was his intimate friend. Source: Ours, fron Cuban govern-

ment official. Also reported that Carlos Prio Socarras, former

President of Cuba, had helped Carbo and Cubele to escape from Cuba.

1959: "Raul CASTRO Ruz is a known homosexual, and in 1959 in Raul'g

heme ta the Camp Columbia Hgs, Raul and Cubela were surprieed while

making obvious homosexual advances toward one another. Cubela later

fell into disgrace with the regime. It is not kuown whether this was

due to his unsatisfactory performance as a student leader or whether

he had had a "Lover's Quarzel" with Raul. Source: Latin American

revolutionary who lived in Cuba until August 1962 and personally met

high Cuban officials. (Ed Note: Perhaps his performance as one-half

of the honosexual tear was unsatisfactory!!?)

doubt that Cardenas still considered himself a friend to Cubela and

as late as 1961 was trying to help get Cubela out of Cuba; this would

hardly be true 1f Cubela had been blackmailing him for jears. There

are other indications that they appear to be good friends. In any case,

this type of blackmail could work both ways - the individuals con-
