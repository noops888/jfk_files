One of the ideas which is under consideration is an operation designed to
convey the message to the Cubans_th the USA and USSR have made a
"secret deal" concerning Cuba. orn|nade available the enclosed copy(S)

passing this story through its sources and would not take any action

It is suggested that the following fabricated story
bo passed to a person with high-leve) contacts in Bayana:

The USA is very much disturved by UN entry
into the Dominican problem, which sets an adverse
precedent in the Latin American area, heretofore
considered the gacroganct province of the OAS.

Tne USSR has been jolted by the resolute
aed rapid action taken by the USA in the Dow -.
nican Republic with the announced objective of
stemaing the tide of Castroism, For the firat
time gince the. missile crisis, the USSR has
geen tangible indications that the USA fs not
averse to invading a Caribbean island. nue 7

In’ view of these preoccupations of both the
USA and the USSR, a tacit deal has coma about:

(a). On ite part the USA agross that
"géetalism’ be alloved to éxzist in Cuba,
but without Fidel Castro, Raul Castro and
Cho Guevara; the USA vould bo willing to
aceopt amy other Cubans now ia govoransnt
pooitions; the USA is villing to Bako
somcoscions (undstorained) elcevkere in
the vorid.
