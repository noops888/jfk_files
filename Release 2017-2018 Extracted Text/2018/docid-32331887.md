PCI CHARLES F, TEEMER, a former top hoodlum of the Pittsburgh

Office, and one-time officer in the Sans Souci Night Club ‘
in ‘Havana, Cuba, advised SA JOHN S, PORTELLA on January 22, - at
1959, that in his opinion SAM MANNARINO engineered the theft :
of firearms from the National Guard Armory in Canton, Ohio, !
but is being shunned by the racket element for his foolishness
in becoming involved in such an undertaking. TEEMER said that
MANNARINO is showing signs of mental illness and speculated
that MANNARINO fingered the burglary of ‘the armory without ao
the knowledge or consent of his brother, GABRIEL MANNARINO ~~
(Pittsburgh top hoodlum). -

TEEMER recalled that while he was connected with the Sans :
Souci during: the period 1951-1952 he felt that NORMAN ROTHMAN ©

On instructions from SAM GIARUSSO, RICCI went to Newburgh,
New York, and obtained a sample MG from TRAPINI on

September 4, 1958, RICCI took the MG to the Pygmalion Club,
New York City, where he met SAM GIARUSSO and they in turn went
to the Warwick Hotel also in New York City. They parked !
in front of the hotel and a man, later identified as JOE
MEROLA, approached the car, took the MG from RICCI and
entered the hotel. RICCI and SAM GIARUSSO then returned

to the Pygmalion Club. Shortly thereafter, MEROLA

entered the club and handed the MG back to RICCI and said,
"This is what I want, get me all you can, but clean them

up.

RICCI returned to his home in Middletown, New Jersey, with the
MG.

On September 11, 1958, RICCI was arrested by ATU Agents at
his home and the following items were seized:

1 .45 caliber Thompson MG, SN 750471
6 Cases of M-1 Carbine parts H
1 1958 Edsel station wagon (RICCI's auto)

It has been determined that RICCI legitimately purchased the
M-1 Carbine parts for $1000 cash from THOMAS A. GREALY,
Grealy Arms Company, 448 Pompton Avenue, Cedar Grove,

#0 Jersey. RICCI stated that SAM GIARUSSO furnished the
1000.

Since RICCI's arrest, JOE GIARUSSO has made several contacts

with RICCI, who is out on bail, for more guns. JOE

GIARUSSO said that "Bayonne JOE" is interested in securing

a@ source for quantity of American-type guns. "Bayonne

JOE" is JOSEPH ZICARELLI, a top hoodlum in the Newark Office. A

It should be noted that the above information was acquired :
by ATU Agents from RICCI on a confidential basis. They are {
presently attempting to develop RICCI as an informant and, .
therefore, request that none of the above information be a

disseminated outside the FBI. i 7

panel truck mentioned at length in this case has been observed
parked in the driveway at. 1127 Freeport Road, Natrona Heights,
Pa., the home of one ART ERRICO, The anonymous letter pointed .
out that the truck was parked near a garage at the end of the
driveway on a number of occasions and described. ERRICO as a ‘
numbers operator.

WILLIAM AHLSTROM, a reporter for the "New Kensington Daily
Dispatch" newspaper, advised SA PORTELLA on November 13, 1958,
that he had received information from one of his sources

that the S$ & S Distributing Company panel truck had been
observed in the vicinity of the National Cash Register warehouse
on 13th or 14th Street, New Kensington, Pa.. According to
AHLSTROM, the source reported observing boxes being unloaded
from the truck near the warehouse. AHLSTROM could only
identify the source as one of the many people who call his
paper on a daily basis to report. ‘information concerning the
MANNARINO mob.

PHILIP JAMES MAINER .
FBI Number 8683144 : >

The Cleveland Office on December 2, 1958, furnished information
relating to. the New Kensington connections of MAINER an
associate of suspect GEORGE MIKE FLOREA, FBI Number 2888609, :
named by a Canton, Ohio, Police Department informant as the
perpetrator of the Ohio National Guard Armory burglary on
October 14, 1958.

‘Confidential source MIKE ZERVOS (protect) in interview with

SA DOUCE on January 6,'1959, positively identified a photograph
of MAINER and furnished the following background information
concerning him:

Approximately 18 or 20 months ago ZERVOS received a telephone

call from HENRY ABRAHAM, aka "PECKY," operator of a cocktail

lounge in New Kensington. ABRAHAM told ZERVOS that he had a

deal that .ZERVOS might be interested in and asked him to come

to his place of business right away. When ZERVOS arrived

at "PECKY's" place he was introduced to two individuals, one

a Syrian.man age about 40-45,’ name unknown, from New Castle

or Farrell, Pa., and the other MAINER, although MAINER was not |
introduced to ZERVOS by name. ABRAHAM told ZERVOS that the

Syrian, man was a very good friend of his and had 1800 cartons of
stolen ¢igarettes in a station wagon parked outside that he would
r.$1a carton. ZERVOS advised that ABRAHAM said that he wanted
she entire load himself but did not have enough money to _
swing-the deal, and encouraged ZERVOS to put up half the money

so they:could buy the load together. : a

ZERVOS refused because He had only been recently released
from the Western State Penitentiary after serving 225

years after conviction for murder and suggested to ABRAHAM
that they take the cigarettes to GABRIEL MANNARINO (Pittsburgh
top hoodlum) who owned the S & S$ Distributing Company, a
cigarette vending machine concern.

In the presence of ZERVOS, ABRAHAM told the Syrian man and
.MAINER that if ZERVOS would not put up any money he was |
not in a position to take ‘the load himself but offered to

take them to MANNARINO in his own car; ABRAHAM left with

the two individuals and looked up GABRIEL MANNARINO who ~
presumably bought the entire stolen shipment. i

ZERVOS noticed the Syrian man in New Kensington a number

of 'times after their initial meeting, driving a black

station wagon, not further described, and assumes that he
regularly supplied the S & S Distributing Company with

stolen cigarettes for at least three or four months since
during his first meeting with the group, the Syrian man offered
to supply cigarettes regularly.

ZERVOS has not. seen the Syrian man or MAINER in New Kensington
for the past year and one-half but observed MAINER several

times after their initial meeting in the lobby of the Kenmar # oan
Hotel and also in the Laetus Club. :

ZERVOS also speculated that MAINER and his companion could

have sold other shipments of stolen cigarettes to JOSEPH :
GIORDANO, aka "RED," operator of the Bachelor's Club in |
New Kensington, and a long-time fence. ~ i

ZERVOS is of the opinion that MAINER's connections in . 1
New Kensington would be with members of the MANNARINO
mob as a result of his original introduction to MANNARINO
or GIORDANO through ABRAHAM, 7

y
ZERVOS is extremely reluctant to make any open inquiries a
concerning MAINER in New Kensington and considers it :
highly inadvisable for him to do so at the .risk of disclosure
as a source of information.

ZERVOS examined photographs of GEORGE VICTOR ZUGRAVE,
FBI Number 2878523, SAMUEL’ JOSEPH MESSARIS, FBI Number 80808,
and FLOREA but was unable to recognize them. | |
