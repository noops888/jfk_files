COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

Talk to be given al an OSI Intelligence Collection Seminar to

be held on 22 and :23 February 1971.

Yesterday and today, you have held discussions on the intelligence

collection process, targetting, and exploitation. In this hour long dis-

cuselon of counterintelligence, I am going to continue that process. 1

am going to talk

about intelligence collection, the procese of targetting.

and the proceos of exploitation. However, in contrast to the other

speakera in the seminar, l am going to discuss you as a larget.

for most of us serving in the Directorate of Science and Tech-

nology or the Directorate of Intelligence, security on a daily basis

consists of showing your badge to the man al the door and making sure.

that your safe le closed at night. During the day we associate with our

colleagues who wear badges to testify to the fact they have been cleared.

Outsiders who come into view also near badges indicating that they too

have been cleared. Thus wrapped in thie cloak provided us by security,

few of us give much thought to the fact that a major pover with endless

funde conalders the United States and in particular the Central Intelli-

gence Agency to be the "main enemy, the primary adversary, the

prime target." There la documentary proof of rais. I can jo on 8o

say that in this age of sechnology where, in my view, the United States

has no equal, the Directorate of Science and Technology and Its offices

such as the Office of Scientific Intelligence rate pretty high on the

priority list of targeto. It has to - look al'the publicity -- aid look

at the fact that as so many of you know, the Soviet technological gap

is something the Soviets are trying to close fast. Interestingly

enough, the KGB S& I elfort has expanded in roughly the same time

frame as DDS&T. Before 1956, there were small S&T sections which

were part of geographic area divisions.: Aböut 1956/57, these leolated

scientific units were consolidated into an S&T department and in 1963.

the department was upgraded into a full fledged directorate. As far

as overseas representation is concerned, the USSR has 4l slote in

IAEA. Twenty percent of these are occupied by KGB S& I case officere.

Don't you believe it. Let us for a

moment pretend that we are KGB or GRU operations officers and that

we wish to penetrate OSI. How do we go about it? Dowe send one of

our nice Soviet lade to call? Do we use a case officer from one of the

Eastern European satellites? Just for an Idea of the magnitude of

the known resources available to us as KOS officers, consider that

In 1969 there were möre than 21, 000 Soviet citizens resident in some

77 non- Communist countries. Of these almost air thousard were

official sovlete and sixty percent or 3, 560 of these official Sorlets

were intelligence officers. Putting this in local terms, there are 100

Sovièts officially lieted as diplomats at the Embassy here in Hashing-

ton. It would be möre than prudent to assume that at least 60 of these

people are Soviet intelligence officers. In addition to this formidable

array to which I have Just alluded, the seven Eastern European Commus

' not countries have among them nineteen different intelligence services.

Adding to the Washington contingeat from these services brings our

number tip to about 100. Bloc intelligence officers. Ah, but you say.

the FBI watches them.

Do they? Consider the statiaties. Assuming

I found out secently, lo my great surprise,

that there are 100, 000 visitore to this building in a year's time. But

lel's get speellic, let's talk about ost..

Between August 1970 and carly this month, Ost had 793 visitors..

Of this number, the bulk, or 454, were from other Government agencieo,

138 were contractore cleared by ClA, while the remülning 201 were

private Inuividuals who either hold no clearances at all or hold some

kind of clearance from another Government agency.

Unfortunately, CIA le rather unique in spending the slois, money

and manhours in clearing people. As you know, we have our own clear-

ance system and do not rely on the checko of othere for our employees or

our contractors.

With other agencies, and particularly with the Depart-

ment of Defense, with employees and contractora in the millions the kind

of investigative checka we perform la CIA would run to the thousande of

people and the billions of dollars, and in all likelihood the whole defense

effort would grind to a screeching halt if they did.
