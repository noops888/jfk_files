RE:

SUSPECT DOMINIC MOIO (Deceased

CV-344-C on 7/22/64 visited FRANK MEZZATESTA, Kent,

Ohio, a close associate of DOMINIC MOIO before his murder.

While there visiting, MEZZATESTA's nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE,

appeared at his home.

The conversation between the Informant

and MEZZATESTA and his nephew got around to Youngstown and both

cautioned the Informant to stay away from there.

MADAFF ARE

stated In Italy when a man has a friend, he can trust him, but

in Youngstown

#friend kills friend.

CV-344-C stated he learned that MADAFFARE was

probably closer to DOMINIC MOIO than MEZZATESTA.

He stated

from their conversation, he gathered MOIO and MADAFFARE had

lived together and although they did not say so specifically,

he gathered it had been In Youngstown.

He stated he got the

impression that MADAFFARE had more information about MOIO's

activities than MEZZATESTA.

When discussing the bombing of BILLY NAPLES on 7/1/62,

MEZZATESTA again stated MOIO had been responsible and that

"they" had ordered him to do this.

" He stated he liked BILLY

NAPLES, but when such a thing was ordered he was powerless to

interfere.

MEZZATESTA also stated MOIO made the mistake of

working for too many factions, and he would work for any group

for money and this was what caused his death when it was

determined that he had "hit" some member of the "organization."

CV-344-C stated neither mentioned who the "organization"

member had been who was "hit," but he assumed that It was

either CAVALLARO or VINCE DE NIRO, who was blown up 7/17/61

while MOIO was In the employ of BILLY NAPLES.
