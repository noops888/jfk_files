OFFICIALS HAD SAID THAT NO WAR WAS LIKELY TO BREAK OUT HAD VANISHED,
THEIR STATEMENTS MADE IT CLEAR’ THAT THEY EXPECTED WAR MIGHT VERY WELL
* BREAK OUT. . “KLUSAK REMARKED THAT “CUBA IS AS IMPORTANT, TO THE USA AS
10 THE USSR". AND THUS CONFLICT WAS INEVITABLE, THE OFFICIALS REMARKS
= INDICATED THAT. THEY EXPECTED PRES KENNEDY TO REFUSE THE SOVIET PROPOSAL
IN QUESTION, - ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION THAT THEY
THOUGHT THAT KHRUSHCHEV WOULD WITHDRAW THE PROPOSAL. DOLTEANU POINTED

OUT THAT THE ORBIT HAD GAINED A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE THROUGH THE FACT
“ THAT THE CRISIS HAD CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL DAYS, SINCE THIS HAD PERMITTED
ORBIT FORCES .TO REACH A STATE OF ALERT, OTHERS PRESENT AGREED THAT

PRES KENNEDY HAD MADE A TACTICAL. ERROR ‘IN NOT. SIMPLY INVADING CUBA
seas WITHOUT WARNING. THEY DID NOT IMPLY THAT THIS WOULD H :D_THE

OFFICIALS WERE SIMPLY MAKING REMARKS FOR THE RECORD OR FOR THE SAKE
OF HAVING SOMETHING TO. R
“INSIGHT INTO SOVIET INTENTIONS.)

THAT THE RELATIVE DETENTE MIGHT EVEN LEAD TO RAPPROCHEMENT OF SOME
SORT BETWEEN NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES, HE ADDED THAT SUCH
AN@ ACTION WOULD GIVE A PARTICULAR ADVANTAGE TO EAST GERMANY, SINCE

1T WOULD MEAN. THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC AT LAST WOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE
WITH EAST GERMANY. : é ;

INCLUDING MINISTER MILAN KLUSAK AND DEPARTMENT CHIEF IN THE MINISTRY
OF FOREIGN TRADE KAREL SVEC, CONTINUED PRIVATE DISCUSSION RE THE
EFFECTS OF THE CUBAN CRISIS, THEY ALL.STRESSED THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAD
HAD GREAT SUCCESS HE HAD AVOIDED INVASION AND SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING
THE OVERTHROW OF THE .FIDEL CASTRO REGIME, AND HE HAD AVOIDED WAR,

THEY UTTERED VAGUE AND OPTIMISTIC BANALITIES WHOSE GENERAL TENOR

WAS THAT SOMETHING GREAT WAS GOING TO DEVELOP OUT OF KHRUSHCHEV'S

HANDL ING OF THE AFFAIR. SVEC COMMENTED THAT THE AMERICANS WERE JUST
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL SCOPE OF KHRUSHCHEV'S "COUP", THIS,
HE ADDED’ tRONICALLY, WAS UNFORTUNATE “IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO OUR
ADVANTAGE HAD THEY REMAINED UNAWARE FOR A LONGER PERIOD. KLUSAK SUB-

eS

SEQUENTLY REMARKED THAT "WE" - HE ADDED THAT THIS MEANT NOT JUST "THE

SOCIALIST CAMP" BUT ALL THE EUROPEAN NATIONS - HAD SHOWN UNDERSTANDING

OF "KENNEDY AND HIS SHIPS. WE WILL LET H H THEM UNTIL

THE ELECTIONS, BUT AFTERWARDS HE WILL HAVE TO PUT THEM AWAY AND NEGOTIATE
