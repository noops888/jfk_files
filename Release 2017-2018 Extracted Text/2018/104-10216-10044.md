1, One of the last of the UNADAGIO tapes, which is transmitted herewith,
contained a passace (marked on the attachment) vhich|
spotted as possibly referring to Rolando CUBELA +S aasrray a -
transcriber has insisted that the first name which he heard
was cc an confident that the conversation is be~
tween a slic Téated Antonio CARRILLO and CUBELA, with another
perscn possibly also nresent. Unfortunately, maddening haruering
noises make any full transcription here impossible. If the tape can
be cleaned up at Headcuarters, it may rive additional insights into
CUBELA's current attitudes.

CARRILLO is the rather thick-tongued individual who is initially heard
making comments which include the illuminating remark ". . . es un
soldado de carajo . . . ." Slirhtly later he annears to say, * estas
equivocado, ah, Rolando." CARRILLO continues after a sudden abrupt
break in the shouting at the start of the passare. CUBELA's voice,
which should be identifiable from other inforr-atior available to Head=
quarters, is heard less often than CARRILLO's.

In farther support of the thesis that CUBELA is CAPRILLO's interlocu~
tor, we note that the conversation takes place about half way throuch
@ reel which began at 1050 and ended at 1645 hours on 17 February.
Reference submits evidence that CUBELA was at the| as of
about mid day on 17 February for the purpose of having lunch with

CAPRILLO,

If retranscription of the tape at Headquarters should produce informa-
tion of interest to this station, nlease send us a copy of the rele-
vant material in Spanish or English.
