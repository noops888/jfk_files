SUBJECT: Future Resignation fron CIA of David Fhillips

1. Ina recent meeting with the Chief. of Station, David Fhillips, the
PECIATE case officer, ‘informally asnounced his intention of resigning fron
CIA in the near future. At that tie Phillips requested that Headquarters
be informed by the Chief of Station. ‘The decision to resign has been made
informally, in order for the Station and Headquarters to have as much ad-
vance notice as possible. Actually, Fhillips does not expect to leave his

ssignment tor about fow months, or sometime in the month of July.
Phillips reports that_the PECTATE building will have been finished and oc-
cupied by PECIAFE staffers long before that time.

2. In the above-mentioned meeting, and In a Memorandum for the Record
avomitted to the Chief of Station, Fhillips has emphasized that his decision
was reached after careful though and has been prompted solely by personal
considerations. ‘Specifically the reascns are:

a, ‘he necessity of Phillips’ return to Latin America to take
care of personal business problens, mainly the sale of his newspaper
in Chile. He has been negotiating for this sale for many months,
but he feels that an advantageous egreement would be impossible to
reach by mail from such a distance.

b. Fhillips' desire to inaugurate a business firm in Cuba.

3. The Chier of Station has discussed this matter with Phillips in
detail, Phillips has reiterated--end has requested that Headquarters be so
advised--that his decision is purely personal, There 1s no question of dis~
satisfaction with CIA, or of e morale problem, On the contrary, Fhillips
hes expressed his regret that circumstances prompt him to terminate vhat
he has described as a most rewarding association with CIA,

4, —hillips' plans for leaving the kestgnment bring up the
problem of future CIA control of PECTATE. ips has submitted to the
Chief of Station his personal recomendations on this score, viich have been
considered in prepering a separate dispatch.
