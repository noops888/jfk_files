Martina di Loe Harvey 05’ a +

The subject of the OS¥ALDs was introduced into tho
interrogation during a discusston about the difficulty a
Sovfet citizen, who uarries a foreigner, encounters in
attempting to leave tho USSR if the KGA chooses (for somo
reason) not to permit the Soviet citizen to emigrate,

Subject stated that 1t goes without saying that prior to
receiving KGB's sanction not a single Soviet citizen, whether
ho or she is married to a foreigner, would be alloved to

nears the USSR,

Asked if the oase of Narina OSWALD's departure from
the Soviet Union was typical, Subject replied that her
departure from the Soviet Union was neither typical nor usual,
particularly in view of the fact that.hor husband, Lee Harvey
OSWALD, was a very strange individual, He had been in Cuba,

“and then came to the Soviet Union not'as a tourist, but as

an American defector who renounced his American citizenship
and attempted to become a Russian citizen, This in itself

is unusual for.an American - it is not typical and very rare
for an American to do so, and Subject believed that an
‘American doing what OSWALD did (seoking Soviet citizenship
and renouncing American citizenship) could only do so because
he was a traitor,

In answer to a request for his opinion regarding the
OSWALD case, Subject said that all of his information was based
only on what was known to everyone who read the newspapers
aftor the KENNEDY assasination and on what he read in a con-~
donsed version of the Warren Report while he wa3 in Western
Europe, When presséd for his personal opinion he said it was
& very unusual situation, Normally a Soviet citizen (like
Marina) would not be allowed to leave the Soviet Union, in
fact the Soviet authorities would try in some way to convince
the oitizen not to leave, However, if a Soviet married a
fbreigner, and insisted on leaving he or she could always, as
a last resort, be refused an exit visa, There have been
cages where a Soviet oitizen married a foreigner and received
‘an exit visa, however, in such cases the Soviet authorities
have conceded to the exit visa requests only because they felt
that the foreign spouse may have had some influence, and could
have created adverse publicity for the Soviet Government had
the exit visa not been granted, This was definitely not so
in GSWALD's case, OSWALD could not insist that Marina be
granted an exist visa since, he was not in a position to do so,
and, consequently the Soviet authorities were not compelled to
do so unless they specifically wanted to let her go to America

with OSWALD,

When asked to still further elaborate on bis beliefs
regarding the caso, Subject stated that in this case (OSWALD's),
Subject. couldn't guess, and in order to come to any kind of a
valid conclusion he would have to know something (factual),
which be doésn’t, His opinion, however, is strictly an
opinion without any basis or fact, He thinks that KGB was
definitely intorested in OSWALD while the latter resided in the
USSR, To presume that OSWALD could have lived in the Soviet
Union as a simple American is excluded, Subject believes that

the KGB kept OSYALD in ‘their fiold of vision" and
undoubtedly worked with hin, To Subject it is unthinkable
that the XG would miss such an opportunity, since 1t
always considers using persons (such as OSWALD) for work
either directly in intolligence, a3 an agent, or in any
other way “to inflict damage to tho West",

Asked whather the assas(nation of President KENNEDY
could be considered as “boing damaging to the West”, Subject
answered in the affirmative,

Subject explained that the existence of a government
such-as the United States is a threat to the Soviet regime,
The United States is an example to the rest of the world
(Soviets included) that people can live, survive, and have
a higher standard of living in a democracy. Therefore, the
Soviet Union tried, and tries, to cut the U.S, Government
down at every ‘opportunity, Since’ President KENNEDY was looked
upon by many in the.Soviet Union as a popular personality,
KENNBDY's personal attraction further raised this feeling
that living in a democracy had its benefits, to an even higher
level with the general population of the'Soviet Union.

“ When asked if 4t was possible that KGB could or- would
ever sanction such an operation (the assasination) Subject
answered “yes, at that time (KHRUSHCHEY's) it could have",
KHRUSHCHEV was considered by Subject to be an ignorant
individual who was willing to take risks and adventurous under~
takings. Subject said, however, that this could never occur
under the present Soviet leadership, Subject considered that
the decision to carry out such an operation, (the assasination)
could not have been made by the Chairman of the KGS since he
does not possess such authority, and, therefore, could only
have been made by KHRUSHCHEV himself,

Subject: was asked if such an operation might not have
Anvolved a terrific risk which could have possibly resulted
4n an armed conflict between the two nations, had Soviet
involvement been proven by the Americans, Subject folt that
even if the Americans did acouse the Soviet Government of
complicity in the assasination, the Soviet Government would
certainly deny such an American accusation, claiming that the
Americans were using OSWALD, a crazy man who had been in the
Seviet Union, would say that the accusation was a provocation,
and in all probability would repudiate such American claims,

To underline his point, Subject mentioned that even
though OSWALD was'in the Soviet Union, and was suspected
because he was in Cuba, nothing happened and the Soviet Union
wasn't accused by the Americans,
