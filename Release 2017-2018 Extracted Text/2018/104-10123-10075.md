RE: Your GS-753 of 14-2-151; further to our

22(CA7)/52/589 of 11-6-152.

SUBJECT:

Investigation into the KRIVITSKY case;

the Firm of GADA; "HANS" and "THEONOR WAIT" .

Te are at present reexamining the KRIVIISKY case and are

making aguin inquiries about the firm of(GADA)of Ansterian men-

tionod in your a.n. letter.

Fenuing the rosults of those inquiries we herewith pass you the

following information additional to that sent to you by our

22(C19/52/589 of 11-6-52, that you may the sooner be able to form

an accurate idea of the case

I In april 1951 your (London representative recoived from the

British - acording to infornation received by us from them a

report on the statements the dutch subject henri Christiaan ICk,

made concerning his activities for the

In this report occur the nanes of "iNS", alias "HARRY", and

"PLIS?", alias "Theodor bAlT"e alias Paul HARDI, while two dra-

wings were attached to the report,

which PIECK had nade of

"LED!IG" - Ignace RAISS, and if "HaS".

In the book "This deception" (published by DUELl, SLOAN &

PEARC - New York) the authoress Hede Missins tells, that in the

tirst half of the thirties she was in contact with Ignace RiSs,

SORGE, KRIVITSKY, Paul HARDI, and

• "FELIK"• In the beginning of

the von Chapter (p. 68) the authoress cives a description of Bi-

chard sorts, saying among other hings: "His cold blue eyes,:

sligatly slanted and heavy browed, had retaine their quality of

Looking amused for no reason at all"

It seems à peculiar coincluence,

that PiECK in describing "HANS"

says: "always

appeared to be smiling', and "was slightly Asiatic

in' appearance". Though in some further points the two descriptions

do not quite tally, there is a possibility that "HANS" and SORGE r

are quentical, and that for this reason that sORGe was in the forme

sioned to go to Jupan (though according to PIICK he had not obeyed

the instruction). No doubt Hede NASSING made much more detailed

statements to the F.B.I. on her activities for the RIS than those

laid down in her book; she nust also have given descriptions of

the persons with whom she was in contact.

PlECK gave physical descriptions of his encloyers in the is. It
