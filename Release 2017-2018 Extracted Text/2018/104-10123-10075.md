an accurate idea of the case,

do In April 1951 your(Léndon) representative veccivea from the
British ~ acording to information received by us from them - a
‘eport on the statemeats the Dutch subject Henri Chvistiaan PIECK,
born 19-4-1895 Den Helder, made concerning his activities for the
RIS. ln this report occur the names of "HANS", alias "HARRY", and
“PLTER", alias "Theodor MALY", alias Paul HARDT, while two dra~
wings were attached to the report, which PIECK had made of
"LODSGG" - Ignace 2HISS, and sf "HANS",

In the book "This Deception" (published by DUELL, SLOAN &
PEARC:. - New York) the authoress Hede MASSING tells, that in the
first half of ‘the thirties she was in contact with Ignace R#ISS,
SORGE, KAIVITSKY, Paul HaRDT, and "FELIK", In the beginning of
the Vth Chapter (p. 68) the authoréss gives a description of Ri-
chara SORGH, sayings among other things: "His cold blue eyes,
slightly slanted and heavy browed, had retained their quality of

looking amused for no reason at all".

% seems a pecu r cOlnciuence, that PIECK in describing "HANS"
says: “always appeared to be smiling", and "was slightly Asiatic
in appearance". #hough in some further points the two descriptions
do not quite tally, there is a possibility that "HANS" and SORGE yp
are identical, and that for this reason that SORGS was in the forme:
half of 19535 ap:ointed correspondent for Japan by the "Algemeen
Handelsblaa" of Amsterdam, and. "HANS" ‘had reportedly been commis-~
sioned to go to Jupan (though according to PICK he had not obéyed
the instruction), No doubt Hede MASSING made much more detailed
statements to the F,3.I. on her activities for the 21S than those
iaid down in her book; she must also have Siven descriptions of
the persons with whom she was in contact. i
PIECK fave physical descriptions of his eacloyers in the ®IS. It
is recommendable to examine whether the two descriptions of Paul
HiswvT tally, and whether de. MASSING may ve able with the hel
of PIECK's urawing of "HaNS" and the description to
is + It would be advisavle also to show to iede ‘:aSSz.
nace «8ISS to be able to check whether after
rs il.CK HaS been able to draw a good likeness of his
employers, and has done so with great fidelity.
we should particularly be grateful for the investigation of
IVITSKY case to possess copies of the statemeits ilede
G made concerning her contacts with the’ 4S, and of KRIVITS-
KY's statements regarding his contacts, targets, and other useful
informztion.
