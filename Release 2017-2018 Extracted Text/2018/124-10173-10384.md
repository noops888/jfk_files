B. LEE HARVEY OSWALD

OSWALD came to the attention of KGB when he

expressed a wish to defect to the USSR shortly after his

arrival in Russia./ The KGB after inquiry decided he was

mentally unstable and informed him he had to return to the

United States upon completion of his visit. Thereafter,

ten minutes later, OSWALD would have been dead.

The KGB

wanted nothing to do with OSWALD, but he was allowed to

remain in Russia, apparently through the efforts of the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Red Cross. OSWALD again

came to the attention of KGB when he attempted to re-enter

the USSR by placing a request with the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico, after his return to the United States,

Again the

KGB recommended again his being allowed into Russia. NOSENKO

said OSWALD's case was a routine one in which the KGB had

no interest until he assassinated President KENNEDY: OSWALD

was not approached or recruited for espionage by the KGB

nor was his wife MARINA.

NOSENKO said MARINA was regardéd

as having little intelligence. She had once been a member

of the Komsomol, but had been dropped for failure over a

long period of time to pay her dues.
