A.

Who took the telephone call at the FBI office

relative to Oswald's interview request of

10 August 63?

I don't remember.

Q.

A.

Could it have been William Walter?

• I really don't remember. It has been 14 years.

It would not have been Walter. It would have been

an Agent.

Q.

A.

Usually when a defendant asks for an interview, he

wants something for the information he will provide:

money, help on a pending charge, revenge. What

was Oswald's motive for the interview request?

I really do not know.

A.

Did you ask Oswald what he wanted?

No.

A.

Why would anyone bring himself to the attention of

the FBI if he was engaged in communistic activity in

the U.S.?

I cannot answer the question.

Q.

A.

Did you do a name check at the FBI office after

the interview?

Yes.
