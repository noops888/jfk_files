{2) Involvernent in Garrison's investigation:
None known to date. His forrner position as head of
the Cuban Revolutionary Counclt (CRG) in New Orleans
and his earlier tie to Lawrence LABORDE and others
in respect to guerrilla training for anti-Castro Cubans
has already, however, been drawn to Garrison's attention.

(3) [DDP and DGS relationships:

Z
a) [/DDP. Although a POA for use ta
JMATE was requested on 2) December 1960 and
granted 30 January 1961, the request was cancelled
on 30 August 1961, and BARTES was not ased
during thia interval. (Per JMWAVE 0483,

4 December 1957.) On 27 May 1965 SOD/AB/OPS/3
requested a POA to permit the use of BARTES as a
pilot in the Congo, The POA was granted on

20 July 1965, and an OA on 9 September 1965.
Testing of Subjects skill as a pilot revealed, howeve.
that he was not qualified for the intended assignment.
He wae returned to the U.S. on i February 1966
without having baen used operationally.

tb) _DCS.| The first contact of DCS New
“Orleans with BARTES occurred on 4 May 1961.

Between that date and 9 January 1967 a total of
23 meetings took place. BARTSS is the source of
six DCS reports. Contact hag not been terminate

George BROWN recived a disturbing telepbone call on

22 December 1987 from Hugh AYNESWORTH of Newsweex,
who waid that Bill "Gervags" (Comment: Presumably
identicel with William H. GURVICH) had indicated that

unspecified manner Brown was lavolved with the CIA

{2) Involvernent in Garrison's investigation:
None known to date. During the week 21-23 December
1967 several U.S. newspapers reported that on 20
December Garrison's office had accuséd one Edgar
Eugene BRADLEY of North Hollywood, California, of
conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy. On 27
December he was arraigned on a fugitive complaint and
released on his own recognizance. Extradition ia currently
root. There is no CIA record of Edgar Eugene BRADLEY.
On or about 20 December 1967, however, the Washington
bureau of the Los Angeles ‘Times roade an inquiry of the
A/DCI regarding Leslie Norman BRADLEY. The Newsweek
issue of 8 January 1968 speculated that Garrison might
kave confused Edgar Eugene with either of two other men,
one of whom is". . . a sometime New Orleans pilot
named Bradley who was once jailed in Cuba for anti-Castro
activities." This description fits Leslie Norman BRADLEY.

and DCS relatlonshipes

Ramparts: John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr., Samuel George

of Janoary 1968 adds, “Immediately after
the assassination, a distraught Underhill told friends
that 2 Berci-autonemous CIA clique which bad been
profiteering in narcotics and gun-running was froplicated
in the assassination.” The close Garrison-Turnar
association and Garrison's vouching for the accuracy
of the Ramparts account suggest that Garrison may
make similar assertions when his case cames to trial.

(3)}] DCS relationship: UNDERHILL was an
infrequent contact of the DCS New York office from

late 1949 to the mid-1950's. He was not erazloyed by

were supposed to kill Castro at the same time”, that



T wonwald was a patsey (sic) and didn't fire a shot

that "Kennedy's asvins (sic) were, as was Oswald,
trained by the GIA", etc. On 13 October 1967 a deputy
sheriff advised the FBI that an unidentified assistant

Charles one month earlier and had interviewed
ASHWORTH for an hour. According to PHILLIPS,

Ramparts of January 1968, p. 47, states that a former
Minuteman named Jerry Milton BROOKS had said that
BANISTER was the “head of the Anti-Communism League
of the Caribbean." Ramparte asserts that this “league”
was “assertedly an intermediary between the CIA and
Caribbean insurgency movements."

records, Maurice Brooks GATLIN Sr. (see below) was
legal counsel not, as Ramparts says, to the "Anti-
Communism League of the Caribbean” but to the "Antl-
Communisni Coc:amittee of the Americas". / FBI reporting
clearly indicates that GATLIN was the sole member of

“this national group. An FBI report of 14 February 1961 -
quoted BANISTER as saying that he had never been an
officer or member of the "group", GATLIN’s claims to
