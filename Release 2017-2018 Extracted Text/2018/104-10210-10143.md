ATTENTION:
BUBJECCT: Technical Analysis of Letter and Envelope =
DB CABE 74361
REFERENCE? Wb/2 Memo dated 13 December 1963

1. In response to referenced request, ap original typevritten
letter and envelope addressed to the American Enbassy, Stockhols,
were examined in order to determine the origin of the letter and the
nationality of the writer.

2. ‘The following conclusions vere drawn concerning the letter i
and envelope:

: a. The typewriter in question 1s equipped with an obsolete
' style of German-sade type vhich, according to our references, was

: fitted on a number of typewriters made in Germany during the 1920s

: and early 19308. ‘The poasible mexes vould be Stoever, Torjedo, :
: Mercedes, Rheimetall, Urania, Orga, Yortuna, Continental, Kappel, t
H Grone, Triweh, Merz and yossibly sae others. - Of theso-makes,

the Torpedo, Mercedes, Rueimmetall and Triumph vere probably the

most widely distributed. ,

H db. The machine in question 1g equipped with a black and red

: ritton. The keyboard is very probably Svedish, as shown ty two

j strike-overe: umlaut-u for hyphen and "2" for “a”. ‘These

H characters are adjacent on the standard Svedish xeyboard, but not

: on the German. ‘The umlaut-a vas not used in the street address,

' ie if "Strandvagen” (vnere the dots should have been placed over the u

i second "a"). This might be either a simple oversight or an attempt :
to conceal the writer's familiarity vith the correct spelling.

: ce. The paper of the letter is of the international standard
(DI) size “AS” which 1s almost universally used in Sweden. ‘The Hy .
5 linen-textured stationery ecems to be rather common in Sveden. i
i The two maaller pieces of blank paper match the letter paper with ‘
respect to width, thickness, color, texture and look-! » end ;
Pte were probably cut from another sheet of the same type. ‘The envelope t
matches specimens of Svedish envelopes taken from DB/'+Postal.
Intelligence files. : :



DB Memo #6585 - Page 2

a. The letter. was.posted fram the. Stockholm Ean post office, -
which is located in the central railvay terainal in Stockholu.
ALL nail deposited in etreet mail toxes in this area or in the ;ost
. office would be processed tarough thie station.

e. The cancellation cachet on tne enveloje is identical in
all resyects (format, postmark, number style and length of killer
vars) to exemplars available in our office.

f£. The postage is correct for Svedisa internal mail and the
postage stamp is of current issue.

@- A possible irregulerity is the time lag tetween the internal
dote of the letter, the date of the postmark and the date of receipt
im the American imbassy. ‘The total time from the internal date of
the letter to tho tins of receipt is eight days, the time between
the date of posting and the date of recei;t is more than three days.
‘This trensit tims of more then three days for intra-city mail appears
irregular when compured with the average tronsit time of only tyo-.
three days for arrival betveen Stockholm end the United States.

3- The text of the letter warrants some comments because @ musber
of peculiarities were noted - aside from jure spelling or typing errors -
Vhich seom to indicate a Svedish writer. ‘The folloving vorde represent
veither Svedieh spelling or modification: "reserv”, “etabitened”, “warded”,
“Krustjev". Other examples of Svedish grammar and syntax would be:

“must” (as past tense), ‘in Sowiet” (Swedish form but not spelling),

“he vas syy” (without indefinite article), “FBI, USA‘ (vithout definite
article), “should” (rather than ‘would”), “cutamgglea” (Swedish past
participle form); and-“wnole the worla”-(pure Swedish fora}.

4, Another significant detail is the pame given, “Ryo Liang Yuan’.
"Ryo" is not a standard spelling in any known Romanization system used
for Chinese. "R" 4s eeen in the nov Chinese Communist cational system,
but never in combination with "yo". "Ryo" is @ Japanese spelling. In
the name given it 1s not known whether the Chinese or ¥estern presen-
tation 4s used, ip other vords, whether “Ryo” or "Yuan" is meant to be
the surname. Among Chiness syllables vhich could be re;resented by the
Jspaneos “Ryo” are Liao, Liang and Lung. Of these Lung (7C:7893) and.
Ideng (1C:2733) ere used as surnames. In either case, “Ryo” is hardly
@ name by vhich a real Chinese vould identify himself.

5+ In eomery, end based on the above information, it is concluded
that the letter vas transmitted via normal Svedish rostal channels. The
letter is probably a “crank letter", most likely vrittea by a Swede,
using e Svedich-keyboard typewriter and Swedish stationery.

25/11-83,

The Fresident of the United States of Awerica, Jonn F Kennedy was
assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the governzent of
the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act alone
but there was helpers and reserv. “Now all is over" was password
to his customers, Oswald wasa fully convinced Cozaunist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.
Later he was spy for us. Yhen Lee ii Oswald had returned fo USA we
contacted hia anew sod freshened a his mind “you have veea & Bpy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last informution in Mexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Zennedy in kexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as-
ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should atteck Cuba

when- Xennedy-was-murded as the orginaztion was™behind the: assassin=~
ation. When Cuba was attacxed by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend
himself. It that was so it would burden.Sowiet .that..0swald.had..visi-~
ted. Ye should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A-
bombs and they should not be able to refuse us, We and Sowiet should
win this war and whole the world should be Comcunistic. Then we should
assassinate Xrustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader
of the NEV NORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled
from our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is a: chinese spy-shool,
“My name is Ryo Liang Yuan. Officer in the department for State-secret.
