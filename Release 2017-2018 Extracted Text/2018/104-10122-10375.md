Office of Security files relevant to the request from the

Dade County Sheriff's Office pursuant to their investigation-

of the death of Johnny Roselli.

closed the following:

Rolando Masterter RoJas--Covert. (30.859)-

and overt (352 772)

security tiles were

located

regarding

Rolando Arcadio Masferrer (Rojas), aka:

Roland Rojas Masferrer, a Cuban citizen borr

12 January 1918 in Holguin, Cuba. Although

limited national agency checks were conducted on

Subject in January 1950, there is no indication

that Masferrer was ever utilized by the Agency.

He is a former Cuban senator and Cuban Communist

byb

Party member (expelled in 1945), a former com-

mander for Batista's private army:

and firmly

anti-Castro. The two files contain numerous FBI

reports regarding his activities in connection

with an attempt to invade Cuba in 1960 and a

subsequent effort to invade Haiti

in 1967.

Masferrer and 75 of his followers

were arrested

in January 1967 in Marathon, Florida, while

d. Jose de La Torriente--Security records

contain only sparse information provided by the

Domestic Contact Service in 1970 showing that

one Jose de La Torriente, not further identified,

claimed to have worked for the ClA tor many

years. An attachment to a 1970 Domestic Contact

Service memorandum containing details of Torriente's

claimed association with the Agency was not con

tained in Office of Security files. It is

believed that a decision to release information

"regarding Torriente would have to be deferred to

the DDo.

e. Jose Quintana--Office of Security records

contain no information identifiable with Jose

Quintana.

£. Jaoquin Antonio Cortizo--Office of

Security records are negative..

g. Manola Artimes--Security records contain

overt (611

,523). and covert- (210

regarding Manuel Francisco Artime-Buesa. Artime-

Buesa is a former Agency operational asset

utilized by the DDO during the approximate

period 1959-1963. Any decision regarding the

release of information regarding Artime-Buesa or

his present whereabouts should be deferred to the

DDO.

the subject of the

Office

of Security covert file 101 080. - Cubela is a

rather colebrated Cuban national and operational

contact of the DDO mentioned throughout both of

the Senate Select Committee assassination reports.

Although Cubela is identified in the assassina-

tion reports as AMLASH and his identity has never

been revealed by the. Agency, his true identity

has been surfaced in several recent news articles.

All information on Cubela in the possession of

the Office

of Security would fall within the

puryiew of the DDO, and it is believed that any

decision to release information pertaining to

Cubela should be deferred to the Latin America

Division of the DDO:

It should be. noted that

during their investigation, Senate Select

Committee staffers reviewed Cubela's raw files

from both the DDO and the Office of Security.

i.

sentatives requested the "names of the three

"tion should be deferred

to the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence since the Office of

Security does not have access to the Roselli

testimony.

3. Additionally, the Dade County Sheriff's Office repre-

sentatives ask for all Agency information pertaining to several

individuals of unknown citizenships,

but believed to be U.'S. -

citizens.

A review of the Office of Security indices in this

regard disclosed the following:

Fred Black--Office of Security records

The Roberty Best meet pine contained in

showing that Fred B. Black, Jr., a consultant

with North American

Aviation, was a close

friend and business associate of "Bobby" G.

Black was mentioned repeatedly in the

news media coverage of Senate investigations

of Baker in the early 1960's.

While Black's

citizenship is undetermined, it is probable.

that he is a U. S. citizen.

b.

Edward Morgan--A covert security file

(46: 394) was located regarding Edvard Pierpont

Morgan, date and place of birth 28 May 1913,

The Covert Security Clearance was amended and

approved in March 1951 to include Morgan's use

in providing covert legal support for opera-

tions in the form of a "cut out"', legal advice,

transmission of funds, and other

assistance of

a legal nature in connection with DDO projects.

Since Subject may have been utilized by the DDO,

it is felt that any decision to release infor-

mation regarding Morgan should be deferred

the DDO.

It is noted that while only the afore-

In 1967

Maheu was

interviewed and advised

that he had

briefed Morgan regarding the details of his

involvement in the Agency-sponsored Castro

assassination plots.

ciation with Maheu, professional and/or personal,

is unknown.

It is further noted in the Roselli

file that. Shimon knew Maheu, but the nature and

extent of their official/social relationship is

unknown.

Shimon is described as a former

District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Depart

ment (MPD) inspector who was discharged from the

D.C. MPD as a result of a conviction involving
