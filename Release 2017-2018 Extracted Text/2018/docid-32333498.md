against a Russian vessel in the port of Caibarien, Cuba.

report concerns this raid and is submitted pursuant to instructions

contained in reference (a). Enclosures (1) and (2) are news coverage

of this raid.

News reports were checked against Seventh Coast Guard District

Intelligence files and revealed that through the collection program

prescribed in reference (b), one vessel, the ALISAN, could be suspected

of being involved based upon the following coincidences:

News - Port was Calbarien, approximately 65 miles from SW Cay

Sal Bank.

Keypat sources - The ALISAN was sighted at an unnamed cay at

23-42N 29-12W on 23, 24 and probably 25 March.

b. News - Rubber liferaft used to move explosives to Russian vessel.

Keypat Photos - Rubber liferaft

streamed astern of ALISAN.

c. News - American Photographers were aboard.

eypat Photos - ALISAN had at least one photographer aboard.

d. Fragmentary notes in our files indicated the ALISAN was engaged

in covert activities in the Florida Straits area in the past.

€. The boats with the ALISAN in the enclosed photos are not the type

usually used by a F/V in innocent fishing.
