HELSINKI” :

Robert S. Anson, author of "They've Killed the

President: »The Search for the Murderers of John F. Kennedy,"

offered .a critical appraisal of Lee Harvey Oswald's travel
through Western Europe prior to his appearance in Moscow
on October 16, 1959. Anson expressed particular concern -)
over the issuance of a Soviet tourist visa in Helsinki,
Finland to Oswald prior to his entry into the Soviet Union-
Anson ‘wrote that "fofn Monday, October 12, Oswald went
.to the Soviet Consulate and applied for a visa. It was
ae :

granted two days later” (Anson, p. 159) Anson concluded:

Oswald also managed to secure a Soviet

visa in record time. The CIA told the

Commission that under ordinary circum-

stances obtaining a visa in Finland

took one or two weeks; Oswald got his
in two days. (Ibid., p- 160)* _——-

* Anson-was referring to the Warren Commission Report where ;it
is stated:

The Department of State has advised the Commission

that it has some information that in 1959 it usually
took an American tourist in Helsinki 1 to 2 weeks to
obtain a visa, and that it has other information that
the normal waiting period during the past 5 years ‘has
been a week or less. According to the Department's
information, the waiting period has always varied’fre-
quently and widely, with one confirmed instance in.1963
of a visa routinely issued in less than 24 hours. The
Central Intelligence Agency has indicated (continued), cS

:@his information from the Department of State and the Central

visa may have been shorter than usual but not beyond the.
range.of possible variation. The prompt issuance of Oswald
visa may have been merely the result.of normal procedures,
due in part to the fact that the summer rush had ended.
It might also mean that Oswald was unusually urgent in his.
demands that his visa be issued promptly. Oswald himself
told officials at the American Embassy in Moscow on October
31, when he appeared to renounce his citizenship; that he. had
said nothing to the Soviets about defecting until he arrived
