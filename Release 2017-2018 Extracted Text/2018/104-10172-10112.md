Aftcr the'war, Or. Hatgerin worked wnth the United Nations,
for 8 coupie of years and then joined the faculty of Boston
University where ho was volved in the establishment of an
Interdiscipinary. depariment ot Latin Amencan studies.

ing this period he visited Bras twica, lecturing at the
Unlversity of S30 Paulo and serinng as a colsuitant to the
state government of Sao Pauio.‘Atter hus second visit. he was
Cecorsted by the Brazilian government wih the Order of the
Southern Cross.
ftwas thch that chance intertered again, ths time in a most

maicious way. ;

“Ay stay at Boston coincided with the most intense period
‘of McCarthyism and this raised problems for a creat-number
‘of p2onia at tho timo. In my own caso, ( was given tha choice
‘of co-oporating with ho Ingussten or, 03 turned out ng

Leaving Boston University, he went-to the National Uni+

working thero, he did some consuting work for the Mexican
Goverment, thereby gaining turner practical “experience

* onthe probiems of underdeveiosment in Latin America.

This experience ted directty to his next position — a three
year appointment at the Acaoemy of Scences in Moscow.

At that fimo, the peviod when Knsschev was trying to
foozen up somo of tho rigid controls of Stalin's aictatorship,
there was a desire at the Academy to nave some western
expertise on. Latin American ceveloprental problems. In

_-othst words, my Mexican exbehence was a direct prerequi-
‘sito for the Moscow invitation.” -

“ns strange how, in retrospect what seemed to be a
rattier dilticut choice in 1953 tumed out to be very tucky.
‘You never know. Something hagpéns that can crush you cr,
on the contrary. can make you hearmwer and more robust
than you've over been before.

“And, when tho invitation came

towist: neither was 1 there a3 an outside researcher, | was
ectuatly in the machine. with no permanent hes to it. 1 was
‘working in tho factory, rather than just studying it" :

Fote ence again intervened in his Me. ths timo in the form
‘of the celebrated Latin Amencan guemita leader, Cho

“Late on0 right, there was a MnceX on my coer and I

Mexico and they suggested iat,  wew ef tne reed tor
competent educators and socal se:xennsts 9 Cuda, | gat

As it happened, Dr. Halperin wes interested. He scent the
‘ont six years in Cuba,’and after temnng, produces 4 book
‘on the country — The Rise and Ovcive of Ficel Castro: 4r

Aa with tho Moscow oppointment, it was the fact that he |

| MEMORANDUM F FOR THE RECORD

SUBJEGT: “American Defectore to the USSR"

1, The attached material wae part of a soft file entitled
"American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR/6
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components
untilca, 1963, The compilations were derived from a variety ~
of sources, and contain both classified and ovext data,

2, In the alt of 1966, the files were turned over to CI
Staff, In most instances, basic information was then abstracted
fox the US Defector Machine Program, In all instances in which
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
@ copy of this memorandum,

3. It is suggested that any dissemination of this-data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in
view of the ficquently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have alreaily been made through the US Detector ©

. 1. Attached is a copy of DBA 34398, dated 26 Pebruary
1963, concerning Maurice Halperin and his activity in Cuba.

2, The Station’s attention is drawn to Page two which
states that Subject’s wife hopes to obtain Cuban citizenship
so that she can come to Mexico to see her son and grandchildren,
On the game page, there ts an Antoresting, yet vague, referenca

to his treatment in the USSR.

3. Headquarters is still most interested in Bubject,
and the Station should be alert to any information it can gather
on HALPERIN, or on his wife's travel to Mexico, which might
be used for KUDESE or KUWOLF Purposes. .
