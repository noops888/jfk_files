MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: John H. Waller
Inspector General
SUBJECT: Oswald Docuents -- Action Taken
1 ached herewith is an edited version of the memorandum

ast forwarded to you on

on Kessler's article in the Va
27 Rovenmber 1976.

2. In an effort to obtain-all the information that is avail-
‘ice of Security, at the behest of the

ed a formal security investigation

is to be confined to an analysis of
Agency files and records and to present and former Agency employees,
including the translator formerly assigned to the Mexico City Sta
tion, the typist at the Station at that time and Mr. David Phil lips.
They state that it is virtually impossible to estim the length of
will take to conduct these investigations.

Inspector General, has in
into the reported leaks. This

4. The Inspector General has also recommended a the Mexico
Branch of LA Division send a cable to the (He ico Station) inquiring
as to what records may still be there relating to the period of
Oswald's visit to Mexico and afterwards. As of this date, we have
not located the original transcripts of the telephone intercepts of
Gswald's 1963 telephone conversations in Mexico City. We are hoping
that the present intensive search will unearth then.

5: The kinds of information currently being deleted by the OF-
fice of General Counsel from Oswald documents under Freedom of Infor-
mation are as follows:

a. Information confirming the existence of an Agency
station in a named city (country) abroad.

b. Cryptonyms and pseudonyms.
c. Identities of Agency staff employees.
d. Identities of agents (foreign intelligence sources).

e. Revelations concerning the Agency's use of identi- 1
fiable operational tactics, techniques or equipment.

f. Confirmation of the existence of liaison agreements
or working relationships with identified or identifiable
foreign intelligence and security services.

g. Revelation of information received from foreign
liaison services; obtained under agreements that committed
the Agency to protect the facts of the liaison arrangements
and any information received under-it, to protection against
unauthorized disclosure.

h. In a number of instances the kind of information
cited above, if subject to public disclosure, would still
(thirteen years later) have a damaging effect on U.S.
foreign affairs, national security interests and/or
intelligence operations and classification is still
justifiable under Executive Order 11682.

nN


i. Identities of Agency components and internal
Agency filing instructions.

j- Information concerning activities or behavior
ple not even incidentally involved in
the assassination whose personal privacy would be un-
justifiably invaded should the information be released.

k. Identities of U.S. law enforcement officials.

6. J cannot guarantee that the OGC sterilizations, following
guidelines described in the attached memorandum, are generally as
minimal as you may want. As you can see, this process has been
going on since last April, thus it would be a major undertaking to
begin all over again. I will look further into this, but if you
ultimately conclude that-there should be a different standard for
FOIA releases on this subject than on others, we may have a very
large job ahead of us. DDO, OGC and the FOIA office should be
heard from. :

7. With regard to the Sprague investigation, our intention
would be to let Sprague or his investigators have generally un-
fettered access to our relevant files tiers in this building. Those
documents he wishes to take out would be given a minimal steriliza-
tion. Those documents which he wishes to have taken out and declas-
sified would be sterilized for that purpose. I anticipate that the
problems will occur as we disagree over what may be declassified.
His instincts will be to want to put as much as possible in the
public domain. But, we will have to face those bridges when we
come to them. Much will depend upon the kind of agreement OLC
will be able to negotiate in advance on security matters.
