as blue and green), wears glasses. No

Pleasant. easy-going, nervous, ‘quick-tempered,
brusque but sincere, opinionated, strong-minded

Vice Minister, MINCEX, 1964-1967,

Commereiatl Counselor, Cuban Embassy,
Mexico City. Although he was : cee

" accredited to that position in

December 1963, ‘travel indicates he
was in’ Mexico from August 1963 to.
May 1964. Other references indicate
he was in that position in Scptember

During the Batista regime he was in

POLITICAL
ATTITUDE:

U.S. 5 April 1957, overstayed”
his time, and on 11-February 1958

was ordered deported; claimed he.
would be killed if he returned to

Cuba and did not show for deportation.
Subsequent investigation shoved he | ~
was in Cuba’ aw -of 2. Maren. :

A member of the Cuban Communist -

.-Party,,.sdmitted on the récomicndation

of Armando. HART Davalos, Secretary

of Organization. Although. he: has :
beon described as a militant Communist,
a convinced ‘supporter of the Castro
regine and a fanatic Fidclista, there
is evidence to dispute this image,

An analysis ‘of availablo information
indicates that he is not a convinced
Marxist, he cannot accept Party
discipline, and that his character

is basically incoupatible with the
systen he serves.

His. father is reported to be an old-
guard Communist and a leader of | =
the barber's union. A brother
reported to-be a member of DSE in 1946,

He expressed dissatisfaction with
his position as a diplomat, feels

his talents are vasted and would like
A position in commerce or industry,
where he considers he could better
serve the revolution. Has criticized
the bureaucracy and inefficiency in
the government in Havana,

He has ‘said that many Cuban diplomats,
want to stay out of Cuba, but it
scemed to him that the Cuban government
wanted to keep hin (RUIZ) out of the
way (i.c., outside Cuba). That LEON
had appointed him, supported him, and
they are good friends, but that ne
(RUIZ) does not like to work with a
man who one does -not get to know,

nor to know what he is thinking. He
said he felt as if he were in Mian,

i 1. There is little we can contribute to the exceptionally
jis:

character, personality, physicaland mental“ capabilities,
and to somé extent even his vulnerabilities, are succinctly
outlined in-your reports. In addition, you have appropriately
recognized the Hurculean task we have, to overcome his, strong-
mindedness and idealistic character.

| 2... After a series of discussions among the officers
involved ‘with PBRUMEN’ operations at the Station, we have
concluded that to execute a logically developed "traditional"
recruitment, we are faced with the challenge to recruit a
person, an intermediary, in whom ANAUTO-1 has confidence and
respect; an individual who is able to plausibly carry on a
polemic argument with AMAULO-1 without cither antagonizing

him or causing him to become suspicious of the intermediary's
true role. Moreover, the intermediary must be intelligent

to be able to respond in an appropriate way to our instructions,
as well as show a genuine willingness to cooperate, Frankly,
we have no such person, currently on our list of assets and

to find someone with the attributes sct forth in Reference A,
will be difficult to say the least, but we are prepared to
work diligently on this problem.

SECRET/RY BAT

3.. AMAUTO-1 confides in few people. From our reading
of QUTINID. and QUDOZE), there are at least three persons
who could Josically and effectively fill ‘the role as an
intermediary, They are Identities A, B, and C. We can
eategorically climinate Identity A for obvious reasons, i.e.,
lack of direct access to him. Because of his relationship
to identity.D, we can also tentatively ¢liminate Identity B.
He: presents’ a: Fisk which"we are not certain should be taken;
however ,:wé would like te add 2 comment on him in a later
paragraph. . Identity C, would’seem to be the most logical
choice. He is intelligent, a professional man, well-to-do,
young and .one with whom ANAUTO-1 frequently talks and whom
he often sees... We know little about Kis political proclivities
although he gives the impression of being a moderate analyst
of world events and doesn't: secin to have 2 strong affection
or aversion for the -PBRUNEN Government. We have. a good
background on him prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;
however, as-you:can well. imagine, the report concentrates on
_ the economic’side of ‘the_individual. We have made a number
of-attempts-here in the to determine whether he has
any American contacts, but with negative results: His visa
file does not show where he visited in the United States or
the purpose, except that it was a business trip. He has an
_ indefinite visa and we are fairly certain that, if necessary,
we could use the question of -his visa as an entre to him,
We are currently reviewing with all Station assets their
knowledge of Identity C, In addition, we are also considering
assets Such "as QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, who could, under some
legitimate business pretext, contact Identity C. Our objective
is to develop -a warm entree to Identity C without compromising
any of our agents, but we are in need of an assessment of
Identity C by either a Station Officer or an asset working
under an officer's instructions. We will keep you advised of
our progress. We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate
cover. A POA on Identity C was requested separately. There
are no derogatory Station traces.

4, Identity B would be an excellent choice if not for
his relationship with Identity D. This avenue might be explored
with QUSEQUIN-48 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint
operation, QUSEQUIN-48 could probably get the necessary
clearances from Identity D directly, or from one of Identity D's
aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until
we receive your comments. f

5. It is not too early to consider the emoluments we
might want to offer to AMAUTO-1 at the time a pitch is made.
AS always they’ should be divided into two areas ~ for detection
and for recruitment and work in place.

@ PBRUMEN government has approved the construction
ee ‘a now office building to be used as an’ Embassy,
mamercial office and residence for the PBRUMEN Minieter.
j@ Site has been identified and work is expected to begin
s00n,.-probably” af: the return of AMAUTO-1 from PBRUMEN,
‘sometime within the text tvo weeks, The builders expect to
complete the building within eight months. : .

i 2. QUSEQUIN-37 ia far mere confident than we are, about

the possibility of getting access to the building during the-
construction phase to possibly install various audio devices.
We believe':this operation to be fi ble one and we might
be challenged by the presence ~ PBRUMEN security
forces overseeing the construction, tho presence of PBRUIMEN
electricians and other professions, complicating the access

. to the building, Wo believe AHAUTO-1 has the
experience well in mind and-most likely will ag
within bis pover to overcome the possibility of an audio
penetration of his building.

3. We vould be grateful for any information addressees
might have on the general modus operandi of PBRUMEN security
forces in areas where PBRUHEN official installations have been
constructed, Have they used PBRUHEN technicians, electricians,
construction engineers, etc? Also wa would like to know whether
the’ PBRUMENS have installed their ovn telephone system or have
they generally relied on the system of the host country, We
would appreciate too, any comments Headquarters or

problems of most concern to his mission: i

jthe Cuban charge d'affaires in Madrid
Perez outlined the salient.current

a. Building construction. Ruiz submitted
a proposal to Havana in December 1969 for- the
construction of a building to house all the mission
offices including the embassy, the consulate, the
commercial office, the Cubana Airlines office, and
possibly the minister's residence, Ruiz had not
recei onerete reply to the proposal and he
urged’ eo take it up again with the ministry.

b. Radio facility, Responding to a request
from the Director of the Cuban National Fishing
Institute, Emilio Aragones Navarro, in
December 1969, Ruiz applied to the Spanish authori-
ties for permission to install a radio facility.
in the Canary Islands for communicating with Cuban
ships. The permission had been granted by late
December yet Havana had failed to follow up the
project with’ plans and instructions.

, to the red tape which.involves processing the -
ter # requests through two ministries; The Visa Section ae
Bisa in’ thé Ministry‘of Foreign Affairs, and the 5
- Directorate of Immigration in the Ministry of

as El Guajiro, Probably.comes. from a humble
family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar L in

‘ Cuba, a ‘slum dwelling 7 in Marianao and began
to work when he was only 14 years old.

In the fifties he emigrated to the United
States, travelling throughout the East Coast
and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to
t i work as an.apprentice butcher for a Polish-
“American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a
grocery store on Flagler St, in Miami. He
7 did'so well in attracting Latin-American customers
H H to the store that he soon began to distribute
H meat in ‘the area for SAMKO,

He has said that when he left Miami
in 1958 he turned over to his brother @ house
in North Miami, a brand new car, and over a
thousand dollars in the bank.

i i But his "success" could be traced, perhaps,

: oe to another acquaintance that he 1a known to
have had.

‘Furthermore, LOUIS or LUIS even asked them

In 1960 he was one of 18 out of 5000 who
were selected by the Ministry of the Treasury,

“two years, included such subjects as mathematics,

EDUCATION : Aside from the statistics course
taken in 1960, RUIZ seems to lack, in the eyes

of some cbservers,.a solid, formal education,

“But he makes up for it by being an avid reader .
(flve newspapers a day, plus books). -This impression,
“however, may be wrong, for there are indications

that’ he either studied or wanted to be a CFA,

-He. understands and speaks English and
‘rench (fluency unknown), and has undertaken
to ‘teach grammar to the embassy staff. : -

Senaitive to art, or so he says, he
frequently complains of the general lack of
culture in.Cuba. His vocabulary level is rather
low, cussing quite often in the presence of
others...

RUIZ is well-versed in world affairs,
and does have an understanding of international -

trade,

He has read some of the works of José Marti,
whom he likes to quote. But there is another
book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PRILBY's,
the KGB spy who penetrated MI-6,

He is up-to-date on current intelligence
publications. :

HEALTH : Blond, baby-faced, and blue-eyed ("Very
handsome," according to Anita, the young maid ),
RUIZ is known to be suffering from an undisclosed
liver illness for which he takes.a medicine called
“bilidis, Late in 1969 he was planning to goto
Portugal on vacation followirg the advice of his
physician,

Nothing ‘is known about unofficial contacts i
vith other diplomats in Madrid except that he | \

Algetian Ambassador,

At times he tries to give the impression,

“personal confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Radl : t
ROA, : : f

: “He frequently tells other Cuban diplomats i
“stopping in Madrid that he makes 90% of the
decisions without consulting Havana because
that is “why I am here for." zs

Above all, he directs constant and bitter
eriticiem against the bureaucracy in Havana
because of ‘its incompetence, which, in his opinion,
will ‘cause Fidel CASTRO to carry out a major purge
after the 1970 sugar harvest comes to an end ("No
one in Ravana wants or cares to make a decision"),

The Peter Principle /“" In a hierarchy every
employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence" 7,
which ‘he has read and ts going to send del CASTRO
for réading on the advice of should
be taken a8 an example of what is happening in
Cuba. Furthermore, in his view Havana is always
trying to interfere with the Embaasy in Madrid,
resulting in lack of co-ordination and even co- .
operation. ( To! " More
than lack of organization there is chaos in Cuba
today,")

He directs almost the same criticism against
his staff in Madrid because they, lack qualifications
for the posts that they hold, " They think that I
ama fool," he once told an associate, "but I
don't miss anything that they do."

in, turn, he has also been th
eriticien -from Havana, first from
who. made ‘a critical evaluation of the Embassy
which he decided not to answer ("I took a
librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot .all about

it’

in. mid-February 1970 for another review of
. ‘embassy, accomplishments. But this time she
-seemed ‘friendly with Giillermo RUIZ._/

. “Om afiother occasion he complained to -
Arfstides DIAZ that ‘he had received one more
critical. report:from Havana because the Embassy.
"had not achieved much," although they. had done
‘things ‘that were not included in the Earnie

plan.

But perhaps the most serious censure of
his activities came in by telex (" Why worry?
The Americans and the Spaniards intercept all
messages anyway") early in October 1969, Havana
questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade
negotiations with the Spanish Government. {The
trade agreement was extended by mutual consent
to 31 December 1972.7

In his reply addressed to Radl LEON Torras,
first vicé-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban
official directly responsible for the talks,
Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed"
and "consulted" in rather strong language.
Therefore, he rejected that his cable number 521
was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade
official who had been the source of the complaint,

In the last paragraph he told Rail LEON
that the indemnification question ( payment to
Spanish citizens who owned property in Cuba)
depended on his reply to Don Pedro SALVADOR,
a Spanish Foreign Office official, and not on
"bribery" conjectures,

~Evidently this last cable upset him so

“-“vmmueh’ that he was nervous and particularly

security-conscious. Less than a week later,
he called Rail LEON Torras and requested
permission to go to Cuba, ostensively to
settle @.“personal problem with my son,”

When he returned to Madrid on 29 October

’ fhe wag'a changed man, again fully confident

+) of himself, Nevertheless, he has told close
friends that he feels very lonely in Spain

and‘has had the desire to simply board a plane

atid. return: to Cuba abandoning the Embassy,

Late in January 1970 he was again de-
pressed, for he felt like an “exile” ia
Spain after two years of service ( " Even
though ‘LEON played a part in my appointment
I cannot work for a man that I do not under-
stand, Maybe. he sent me abroad to get me out
of the way. I feel as if I were in Miami,")

He thinks he is "burned" in Spain, and
when he returns to the Island he will definitely
not go back: to MINREX, but to MININT. He has
told close friends his term in Spain 1s up and
he will be returning to Cuba probably in the
summer. In any event, he does not plan to be in
Spain more than nine months. Nilda, his wife,
has stressed that they are leaving Madrid permanently

in July 1970. i

POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS: Although.
outwardly a "revolutionary", Guillermo RUIZ

is a man of moderate political views struggling \
to justify the actions of his government in

face of the political and economic realities

of Castro's Cuba,



SECRET

-10-

In ‘thig sense his inner feelings perhaps
lie closer. to the theory of the betraved revolution,

-but not ‘for ideological. reasons: the incompetence

of the Cuban Government has in fact sabotaged ©

the goals of the: Revolation,

A member .of. the Cuban Communist Party, to
which: he-was admitted on the recoumendation of

_ Armando HART Ddévalos, secretary of Organization,

@ définitely not a convinced Marxist, and
quently cannot accept the role of "robot"
Ee tred by Party discipline and ‘vertical
trietire ( " Revolutionaries ‘should not be
coerced by political control forms," he wrote

‘Telesforo DIAZ Portillo, a MINPEX official,

on:26 December 1969, " Communists are quite
meddlesome," he told another colleague soon
after, although in this instance he may have
been referring to the Spanish CP).

But the most important revelation of
his views came to light on 11 December 1969,
when he was quoted as telling a visiting DAP
official from Havana: “" If I. disagree with
orders, I question them because I am not a
robot nor do I have the mentality of one. As
a human being I express opinions no matter
the risk that I may personally have to take,"

Obviously, a man who thinks in this way
cannot be a Marxist,

Aside from the constant criticism of
Havana because of incompetence, Lack of vision,
and the unreal. world they live in, he is quick -
to point out other deficiencies in life there,

“as reflected in his directive to the embassy

staff not to celebrate Christmas together
because there are "hungry people" in Cuba. But
he did invite some of his associates for dinner

He does not hide his favorable opinions
of the American people, who are "frank" and
“simple”, " They treated me very well,” he
told Raul LEON Torras in December 1969,

On international matters he is up-to~

‘of hia views, which are contradictory at times:

" Cuba is a political power, not & military
or economic power.

* The USSR has neutralized U.S. sea power
in the Mediterranean. :

" Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever ft

SECURITY : It is normal for any member of the

(»€uban Foréign Service to exercise certain discretion

the area of security, but Guillermo RUIZ is
particularly sensitive in this respect, which
perhaps could be traced to his probable involvement
with the DGI in one way or another.

He is quick to warn visiting Cubans of the
CIA's efforts ( "La Compafifa Sociedad Anénima" )
to compromise them, even before leaving Havana.
“Our Enbassy," he says, "is the primary target
for U.S. operations in Spain,"

He keeps control of mail going to and
coming from Havana in the diplomatic pouch,
“and states repeatedly that his office ig
bugged and telephone tapped (" There are micro-
phones here the size of olives"), In addition,
he thinks he-is followed openly by Seguridad,

For all these reasons he has acked Havana”

for funds to build a new embassy, where he plans
to have a shielded room free from microphones, ( The

. building, which will cost approximately $600.000,
was approved by Havana and a Cuban architect travelled
to Madrid in late March 1970 to discuss the project
with Sr. VILLARROYA, from Construcciones Aza ra, who

a following:

Carlos or Enrique CARRASCO,- He is a ©
partner of Carrasco, Munoz e Iturriaga, with
offices.at Avenida Generalfsime #28, 10th floor.
RUIZ meets with him often, either for lunch
or at his home. They seem.to be good personal

for the sale of Cuban frozen seafood. Travelled

to New York late in October or early November
1969, RUIZ is known to have visited CARRASCO's

Rosendo CANTO.- Lives at Goya #54, Madrid,
His friendship with RUIZ may be interesting if
he is the same-Rosendo Canto who was’a well-known
batistiano ( probably hia father ), If. this is
the-case contacts with RUIZ are politically -

SUMMARY: Guillermo RUIZ is a very shrewd, :
arciculate individual who has reached heights fae,

that in all probability would ‘have been beyond -
his capability in normal circumstances.

Nevertheless, from what can be seen hia
work in Spain ‘has been effective, and he keeps
“va tight control over his scaff, Yé‘ig a man

--, eonétd and of the backing [~ —]
ue 7 thec“he-surely aust
F ve in order to remain in this sensitive post »

‘of the Cuban foreign service.

E Precisely because of his privileged

status RUIZ is very careful in whatever he does,
avoiding mistakea that would endanger his
position,

Therefore, he will probably resist any

indirect approach, which he will Tecognize fa

time to brush it off, .

But this does not mean that he is una: roachable,
- for he is not, There is no question that hig
personality is incompatible with the system that
he serves, although with profound misgivings as
fo its efficiency, It is then a question of
how and when,

The, wery fact that he has made open remarks
suggesting his unhappiness with Havana and his
non-Marxist leanings in-an office "bugged by
the other side,” as.he points out, could be
interpreted as ‘a signal on his part indicating
that he is ready to listen,

But he will be suspicious of an indirect
or subtle approach, which, in his view, could
be a trap to compromise him, including a loyalty
test by the DGI.

\

Consequently, a direct approach has much

:better chance of success. It would be proof for

him'that he is walking on fi ground by
dealing-directly with Americans. Which | leads
to the question of when. There are two key
factors to consider : ,

a) His recall to Cuba, :

b); The 10-million ton sugar harvest, which
. 48 scaeduled to end on 15 July 1970.

RUIZ has indicated that he is. unhappy in +
his post--perhaps not really meaning what he
sayse~, which he has occupied for over two
years, :

As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans
a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest,
he himself may be one of the targets. Assuming
that his ideological inconsistencies have been
noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof
regarding his loyalty and considering whatever
support he has in Havana, may request his :
recall at an appropriate opportunity: during —
8 major reorganization of the Cuban Government.

In any event, RUIZ does not expect to
remain in Madrid much longer, and is planning
to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.

If Cuba is successful in harvesting 10
million tons of sugar, and they have already
reached six, the "victory" chat Cuban propagandists

‘will herald ‘from July on may have a psychological

impact'on RUIZ's thought. He will be less
inclined to defect, in place or otherwise, at

such time,

in regard to our Consulate, its activities and relations

attention to correct forms and analyze the contents so
little, The contents of things are not being studied,

-and it is essential that deep thought be given to the work
that 18 being done. When someone comes to the Consulate
with an authorization ‘to travel to Cuba, it 1s usually
three or four days prior to flight departure. Since the
Visa Section must defer to the Department, of Emigration
for its:authorization, inasmuch as the latter determines
whether or not a foreigner can go into Cuba, the process

.4s not carried out with the urgency that 1t requires,

*“eonsequently, there is delay. This creates much inconvenience

RUIZ P

es Guillerno I

DOB: c. 1931 :

Cuban Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain,
accredited 12 December 1967.

_ CHRONOLOGY

‘ 1. RUIZ probably comes from a huinble family in Cuba, decause
barcieat he Jived in a so (semit-slum area) and began to work when he

was only fourteen years old. This circumstance suggests that he
lacks a formal cducation. Ie appears to come from a "revolutionary"
family (his father was identified as a Communist and a leader of
the_baxbers’ union in UFGA-13595, and a. brother. was identified
as a member of the DSE ‘as of 1964 in_UFGA-19006) , 2p hea ty Cy

DsS230)

2. In the Lifties RUIZ emigrated to the United’ States,
traveling throughout the cast coast and holding, minor jobs.

1957 he'began to work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-

American namod Alexander SANKO, who had a grocery store on
wi, He evidently did so well in attracting

In

Flagler Strect in Mia
Latin American custoners that he soon began to distribute meat in -
the area, working for SAMKO (RUIZ seems to be somewhat proud i

of this success). He also appears proud of the fact that when 7
he left Miami in February 1958, he lcft his brothcr (same brother?) '
a house in North Miami, a brand new car, and over $1,060 in the i

bank,

; 3. Although he did well in the meat business, he traces a
large part of his success to another acquaintance in Miami: an
American of Cubai descent known as Joe LOUIS (or LUIS). Joe
LUIS was_an underworld figure who was at that time competing
with the Italians in the bolita (numbers) racket in Tampa. RUIZ
and MOLEON (fnu), another Cuhan exile, were each offered $800

a month by LUIS to supervise boli collcctions in Minami. (There
is no specific indication that KUIY took his bolita friend up on

this offer). Furthermore, LUIS went so far as fo offer RUIZ and
: NOLEON $5,000 apicce to kil] a_man named FERNANDEZ (fnu), who was
se also involved in the bolita racket in Miami.

4, In February 1957 (note the 1958 date, above; perhaps
an error. on RUIZ' part) RUIZ left Miami along with a man nared
VILLEGAS (whose first name might be Marry) and three other
ticmbers of the 26th of July Movement. They entered Cuba clandes-
; tincly. ‘When the revolution triumphed in Cuba, Alexander )
went to Havana, where he stayed for a weck as RUIZ' house guest.
SANKO offered RUIZ a partnership in the meat business in Miami
if he would return. RUIZ rejected the offer, saying that the
Revolution needed him.

RUIZ as being appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Commerce,

and QUDUZE has hin appointed about that. tine as chicf of. the
trade school at “NINCEX, a post he held for two years. In 1967

he was appointed charge d'affaires in Madrid vice Francisco Ramon

CALZADILLA.

ON THE JOB

7. There secms little doubt that RUIZ exercise the full
authority thet presurably he should have as Minister Pleni-
potentiary, The relations between Cuba and Spain appear to
remain static because of Sp2in’s refusal to appoint a full
Ambassador to Cuba after LOJENDIO was expelled from the island
by CASTRO in 1959, RUIZ is involved in and is kept informed
on all matters related to Cuban-Spanish relations, including
trade. fe does not scem to permit conmercia] attaches to bypass
him when they submit reports to their respective. home offices in
Havana, In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interest in
Cubana operations, and he has said that no one may travel to
Havana on Iberian without his permission. He insists that Cuban
officials arriving in Madrid.consult with him before arranging
visits to Spanish officials or factorics. .He seems to have
good working relations with Spanish governnent officials,
because he is always careful to “put all his cards on thc table”
in neetings with them. (The tenor of his ‘conversation seems to
emphasize that he likes things this way in all his relatio
personal as well as professional).

8, Little appears concerning RUIZ’ unofficial contacts
with other diplozats in Madrid, except that he is close to and
exchanges inforration with the Algerian Anbassador.: (Accord-
ing to current records, this is Akmed LAIDI, posted to Madvid
on 15 December 1986, living at Calle Tiemblo 3, Ciudad Puerto
de Fierro, Latest desk traces show this person as born 20 April
1934 in Oudja, Yoroceo, aud as of 25 October 1966 to have been
the Director General of the reign Ministry in-charge of
political, econozic, and cultyral affairs. He is described as

Office in 1964, and he functions mere on special assignment
than as part of the chain of coavand, - He wax a mgmber of the
Algerian UN delegation as of 28 September 1965.)

RUIZ trics to pive the impression that he enjoys the
dence. of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raul KOA, thereby

being able to exercise the full authority or his position. He
frequently tells other Cuban diplosats stopping in Madrid that
he makes 90% of the decisions without consulting with Havana,
explaining that: "this is the reason I am here.”

10. Above all, RUIZ directs constant and bitter criticism
¢ of what he terms the ‘inconpcterice there.
reneralized incompctence’ will cause CASTRO
purge after the 1970 harvest ig in. (He

fio one in Havana wants to make any
sort of decision"), One of his favorite books is The Pet er
Principle, to which he refers constantly, and he uses this +
Book-to describe what is going on.in Iavana. In RUIZ’ view,
Havana is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in
Madrid, a situation which results in a lack of; coordination

and cooperation, RUIZ directs the same criticism against his
staff in Nadrid, because his personnel lack qualifications for
the jobs they hold,. le once told an associate: "They think
that I'm a fool, but I don’t miss anything they do.”

In his opinion, this
to carry out a. major
specifically repeats that

11, In turn, he has also been the target of criticism

from Havana, first from Zoila GOMEZ (?), who made a critical evalu-
ation of the Embass. RUIZ' reaction is instructive: ‘I decided
not to answer it, I took a librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot

All about it.” On another occagion he complained to Aristides
DIAZ that he had received another critical report from Havana
regarding his progran for the Embassy, Havana was complaining
that not much had been achicved. RUIZ noted that the Embassy

had accomplished much that was not in the plan, and he intended

to answer that particular criticism in detail.

12. Perhaps the most serious criticism of his activities
came in.a coded cable received by the Embassy early in October
1969. Havana questioned the way that RUIZ was handling the com-
mereial treaty negotiations with Spanish authorities. Ina
communication directed to Raul. LEON Torres (201-725624) (Under
Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Commerce) and in rather
strong language, RUIZ defended his right to be informed and
consulted on the matter, denying that his cable number 521 was
offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ (Director of Trade with Western
Europe and North America), who was evidently the source of

_-eriticism against RUIZ.

14, When RUIZ returned to Nadrid on 29 October 1969, he
was a changed man, agein relaxcd and fully confident of him-

very lonely in Spain zad at times has. had the desire simply to

leaves room for the inference that he would rather go somewhere

“else. Me believes that he is "burned"! in Spain, He bas said

that when he returns to the island, he will definitely not
return to his Ministry. ¢

SECURITY AND SECURITY-CONSCIOUSNESS

15, RUIZ seems to be particularly scnsitive in the area
of security-consciousness.. This attitude can possibly be traces
to an involvement with the DGI in one way or another, but his
background and especially his political views (see below)
would appear to argue egainst his affiliation. RUIZ is quick to

nst the efforts of what he terms "Ja
compania, sociedad anosiza”’ to compromise them, even before
they Teave Havana, indicating RUIZ’ possible belief: in the
omnipresence and power of the nima. He censors mail
going to and coming froa Hava “repeatedly states that
his office is bugyed, tis tclcphone is tapped, and that he is
followed quite openly verever he goes. He attibutes this
surveillance to the Szzuridad, and he probably ascribes it to
the Spanish. (Note TH:t, despite his “knowledge” that his words
go to hostile surveillence, he still dares to express critical

opinions openly).

warn visiting Cubans =

16. This security-consciousness is apparently the big
reason he hag asked Havana for funds for a new Embassy building,
where he plans to have 3 shielded room free from bugs: He intends
to have Havana send electricians for the job and Cuban personnel
to act as doormen, etc., with the wives of the latter to be his.
char force. He seems fanatic on the subject of not having any
Spanish personnel in the building. (Noite that one Sr. VILLARROYA,
of Constructiones Aznar in Madrid, is handling the real estate

operation, ) ;

17, RUIZ is particularly aware of what he calls “traps.”
He once recalled that he had been asked to dinner by the wife
of a VIP and, after accepting the invitation, was told that a
priest would also att He did not attend the dinner,
although it considerably upset his hostess, because he sas
afraid of @ scandal arrasged by the potice! Me said that he

enter only those whom be vant



_18.  Neverthele is several times mentioned: that
he holds his really. inporlant conversations at hose, and that he
would rather sce more people at his howe instead of at his
office, (In this connection, it is noted that the house next
door to hig ~-= Calle Trisna 44 which uged to be a hone for
the aged) is now enpty. The owner of the apartment building
where he lives is Ignacie ARTERO, a Spaniard. oe

19.- RUIZ has even suggested installing a radio transmitter
and speaking in code with Havana, The Cubans are in fact
installing a transmitter on the Canary Islands, but RUIZ,
charactcristically keepinghis actions correct, has stressed
to the Spanish that Cuba will-not use the transmitter for other
‘than legitimate commercial purposes. RUIZ even offercd to allow-———
Spanish citizens to operate’ the station in order to emphasize

his point,

20. Correct as he gencrally is in his professional
behavior, RUIZ made what appears to be a mistake in discussing
with members of his staff the possibility of telling Havana that
A Spanish foreign service officer scheduled for duty there (Juan
TORROBA Gomez, ef, OSMA-25692) might be open for recruitment. If
one ‘recalls RUIZ' constant warnings that his office is bugged by
Scguridad, the discussion about TORROBA clearly exposes him to
action by the Spanish authorities,

21. RUIZ himself is the target of what appears to be
control by Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemus (201-733544) who is
allegedly the First Secretary in charge of cultural affairs
but who seems to be the “sccurity man" in the Embassy. (We
note that CURBELO's photograph was shown to ANBEDEW-1, who did
not recognize the likeness). RUIZ has complained at least once
that he needs a’“real" cultural attache. ‘CURDELO has instructed
the front-desk girl to pass on to him a sumary of who sees whom
at the Embassy and for what purpose, including RUIZ' visitors.
(Given RUIZ’ near-mania for running his own shop, CURBELO must
indecd exert an acknowledged security control).

_ 22, Despite security considerations, however, RUIZ appears
addicted to taking automobile jaunts by himself to the interior

of the country, He must have very powerful reasons to do so, for he
is probably exposing himself to attack by Cuban exiles. Given the
reception accorded to Carlos ALFARAS, Armando HART, and Carlos
CHAIN at the Barajas airport in June 1968, RUIZ might be
unnecessarily exposing himself. He has not told anyone of

where he gocs ox what he does, and both his. wife and CURBELO

strongly disapprove of his custom.

UFGA-19006, She.is probably in her carly thirties. She is

25. Nilda goes shopping by herse}f£, and once she even took
a taxi by herself to the airport to mect her husband, even though
CURBELO did not like the idea at all. She scems to get along
well with the wives of other Cubans on the’ staff.

26, RUIZ' children are:

a. -Guillernito. He is the oldest and is now ‘
studying in Mavana, Thore were reports that he was
unhappy there, and RUIZ asked on 16 October 1969 to.go
to Navana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito,
If there were a problem, it seems to have been solved,
because RUIZ on his return quoted Guillermito as being
very happy in his new school, (Some time ago, Mrs. Hector
GALLO Portieles was constantly needling the other women
about not being “revolutionary” enough and took Nilda
RUIZ totask for having her children with her instead of
at school in Cuba, The RUIZ fanily had brought four of
their children with them, and later the other(s) came
to join them, before the older onc returned to school.
RUIZ once told 2 visitor that Guillermito had been
left with his grandparents during their cxile in Miami
and had been very resentful of it, so they had been
very careful ever since not to repeat that mistake).

b. Alejandro, He is about six years old, Accord-

EPUCATION AND CULTURE

28. Aside. from the two-year statistics course taken in
1960, RUIZ appears to lack a Solid, formal cducation, although
he makes up for it by being an avid reader (five newspapers a
day plus books). understands and speaks English and French
(fluency unknown) and has undertaken to teach grammar (presumably
Spanish) to the Embassy: staff. : :

29, RUIZ appears to be sensitive to art, and he frequently
complains about the general Jack of culture in Cuba. (This
might indicate thatRUIZ considers himself “above" the Revolution).
He shows some of the general inconsistencies of the self-educated,
For exarple, ‘his vocabulary level is rather low, and he curses
frequently when talking to other male members of the staff. On
the other hand, he scems rather well versed in international
affairs and has a good understanding of international trade. It
is probable that he has’ read some of the works of José Marti and,
although he dictates letters to his secretary, he types some of
his own reports to Havana,

HEALTH PROBLEMS

30. RUIZ suffers from what his wife has described as a liver
illness (not further spccified) for which he takes a medicine
called bilidis. (This may refer simply to the medical words for
"liver disease". Competent. experts here guess that the medicine
is used for anything from chronic constipation to gassiness
and constant eructation because of inadequate digestion of fatty
foods, It is possible that RUIZ suffers from the hard~to-pin-down
mal de foie; which can be found in a high-strung, hard-driving
pérson. RUIZ’ evident use of 2ibrium (sce above) might also
suggest this condition).

Late in 1969 RUIZ was planning to go to Portugal to

rest, folloy ation of his physician Dr.
, and whose telephone number appears
cr so a mention of a Dr, PERIU, but his
S indistinct. RUIZ coughs frequently, is used to
cold weather, and was planning to go for his health to the same
Ginnasio as his son, Alejandro.

32. A July 1968 marorandum for the record stated that RUIZ
suffers from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall he had about
12 years.ago. Since then he has had chronic backaches which were
particularly severe during the time that he was in the U.S.,
Haiti, and Santo Domingo, His pains have recurred since he
arrived in. Spain, .On 3 June 1968 he bad a severe attack and was



treated by the
prescribed corti s {ngurable,
since it vas doubted that’ the, injury to his spine could be
corrected by-an operation, RUIZ was further told that the
condition would continue to grow worse, and that within six to
ten years he would have a defective walk. RUIZ planned to scnd
the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to
the Cuban specialist MARTINEZ-PAZ for review.

TRAVELS : 5 :
33. Following are the trips RUIZ ig known to have made during
the last quarter of 1969:

“a. To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car,
on 28 November 1969, returning two days later.

b. To Havana, to settle "a personal problem," on
20 October 1969 via Iberia (first class), returning to
Madrid on 29 October.

¢. To London on 14 November for consultations with
Raul LEON Torres, returning two days later by air,

d. To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December

to pick up an Alfa Romero that he bought for the Embassy,
returning by car and arriving in Madrid on 6 January 1970, ‘i

CTS_IN MADRID i

34. Little is known about RUIZ’ contacts in Madrid. Aside.
from the Algerian Ambassador (see above), we know about: -

a. Pedro RUIZ. A good friend who goes to RUIZ’
home frequently, According to RUIZ, Pedro is quite
influcntial and is a friend of MASSO(?).

paetibeindascd 2h

b. Carlos CARRASCO. Another person who calls
RUIZ frequently. In late October or early November 1969
CARRASCO went to New York.

¢. Rosendo CANTO (201-749310). CANTO lives at Goya
54, Madrid. His friendship with RUIZ is interesting, given
CANTO’s background, because their being together could be ~~
very dangerous for RUIZ unless he.were using CANTO for :
some rcason with the approval of Havana, CANTO wants to go
to Havana for a year, live there for a year, and then join. the
Cuban Foreign Service, Referring to CAXTO's desire, RUIZ
said on § January 1970: "He isa fool!

CHARACTER

35. Superficially, RUIZ scems to be an easy-going and rather :
simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige and pusition he has
and the stccesses he has had professionally in Spain, We appears oo
to have a strong character and probably iplays the predominant
role in his marriage. He arid his wife scem to get along very well

37, RUIZ almost never discusses women with his colleagues,
except for one off moment, when he mentioned a girl he knew i
in the United States:before, the Revolution, Perhaps RUIZ wisely
remembers that Nilda ‘also works at the Embassy and refrains
from mentioning women 6n her account. In any case, he is not
known to be involved in any extramarital affair. (Still, one
wondérs about the custom of absenting himself by automobile

into the interior of Spain).

38. His habits seem to be simple: he likes movies; he
has read Topaz (but made no comment thercon); and he receives
people at his home for cocktails.

POLITICAL AND. IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS

39, Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ gives much
more the appearance of a man with moderate political views
struggling to justify to himself the actions of his government,
especially in view of the political and economic realities of
his country, It is possible that his feclings might lie
closer to the theory of the "betrayed revolution” ---but not
for strictly ideological reasons. The incompetence of the
Cuban governrental bureaucracy, for example, has sabotaged the

revolution,

40, In the first place, RUIZ definitely does not seem
to be a Marxist and consequently he cannot accept the role of
"robot" (his term) required by Party discipline and vertical
structure,

. a. On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo
DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX cfficizl: "Revolutionaries
should net be coerced by forms of politica] control.”

b. On 11 December 1969 he told a visiting
Agropecuario official from Havana that: " ... if ¥
disagree with orders, I question them because I am
not a robot nor do I have the. mentality of one. As
a human being I express opinions no matter what the
risk that I tay have to accept personally.”



-~10-

to what he thiuke i c 1
they may be on the opposite sid: ef thy political. fence
from him. He once meittioncd how he weat out of his way
to greet a "Kusano" on the street because they had been
friends in Havana, The Cuban exile cvidently turned away
from him, but RUIZ defended his own action in initiating

: the greeting.

to have little comp:

ong od ac

“41, Aside from the constant criticism of Havana's incompe-
tence, Jack of vision, and lack of realism, he is quick to point
out the-dcficiencics of. life in Cuba as reflected in hig directive
to his: Embassy staff not to celebrate Christmas together, because
“there ave tiungry pcople at home, RUIZ has also said that medicine
in general is quite backward in Cuba, ;

42, Although he is probably an athdbst (or likes to think
; of himself as one), -he ‘is kriown to believe that “religion should
not be considered a handicap for persons. trying to return to Cuba."
Ne docs not hide his-views of the American people, cither, for
he deseribes Americans as "frank" and "simple", "They treated
me very well," he told Raul LEON Torres in December 1969. On the
ether hand, he refers to Latin American diplomats as bootlickers
because they use the. English language at parties, and he has
remarkcd that "capitalism is no food

43, Ie seems to have a certain admiration for General
‘Francisco FRANCO, of whom RUIZ has said: "FRANCO is the only
reason that Spain is not Communist." RUIZ also called FRANCO
"one of the few most brilliant politicians of all time." These
seem like strange words for a man as securily-conscious as he.

44, He appears to be well-informed on international matters.
Some of his views are contradictory at times, but they characterize
him as what might, be called an undecided realist:

a. "Cuba is a political power, not a military or
economic power."

b. "The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the
Mediterranean,"

c.. "Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever it chooses
to do so, although the base has lost its strategic value
to the United States.” :

d. "US-China rappronchment should be feared, but
also a Japan-China alliance.”

e. "US power is beginning to crumble, but the
Soviets are revisionists."

f. "The Egyptians harm us when they buy sugar from
Cuba and then rescll to other countries."



-l.

. + "We have to be ow the side of the Soviets

for two reasons: first fromthe military and economic
point of view; secondly, because, whether right or
wrong, they are ‘on the same side fighting those who
are on-the other side." :

h. "Cuba has had and now has major discrepancies
with the USSR, China, -and the US, but we.are on the
side of communism because we .are against capitalism,"

1. The following comrsntsa of the Cuban Minister to
Spain, Guillermo RUIZ Perez, reflect Caban thoughts on the
2 ovakian situation:

The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has been
& disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action
would mean taking sides with the Asericans. A friend
may be criticized in private. bat publicly be should be
defended. (QUDOZE, 19 November.) The Cubans have to
side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons.
and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the
same ideological group. Cubn had aad still has enormous
discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the United
States but weighing the differences Cuba is with Communiss
and epposed to Capitalisu.. (QUDOZE, 3 November.)

NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED DISSEM SECRET

1. On 23 September 1969 the Cuban Minister to Spain,
Guillermo Ru iz Perez, called on Ped: Ss vador +

i
for ring the discussion
Salvador told Ruiz that the one and only question which con-
cerns the Spanish Government is ‘that of Cuban indemnifications
and pensions ‘for Spanish employees, and he asked Ruiz what the
Jatter could say regarding this probiem. (Field Comment: The
-indemnifications refer to property owned by Spanish nationals
which was confiscated by the Cuban Government.) Ruiz claimed
that ke had no instructions on what he could say, adding that
the claims were numerous and that the paperwork involved was
difficult and required a great deal of time.

2. Salvador told Ruiz that the subject of indemnifica-
tions and pensions must be discussed during the forthcoming
negotiations, and that the Cuban Government must provide at
least an approximate figure.of what it is going to pay. He
said that the indemnification figure must be based on the. Hee
value of the expropriated properties; less the amount of any
taxes levied om ‘the properties. (Source Comment: Salvador
did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government failed
to reach some agreement on the question but he implied that
negotiations would be delayed uatil the Spanish Foreign
Ministry received the ‘Cuban Government's reply to this Neer A
question.) (Field Comment: Since the conversation between :
Salvador and Ruiz was held before the recent change of the

c.. Concerning the impending trade negotiations
with Spain, in addition to the economic problem the
Cubans are now faced with another. impediment which
further delays the negotiations: the recent changes

: in the ‘Spanish goverament. It-ds difficilt at this
ae : time for the’Cubans to approach any Spanish official
\ because of the climate of confusion among them. Most
Spanish officials have no idea-as to whether. they will
remain-in-their posts or will be replaced. Therefore, ‘
‘it is’futile for the Cubans to press them for action i
on the negotiations. Tle. most they can do is wait
c ES patiently until the situation is normalized. If the
Y :7' Negotiations are not held within the 30-day expiration
aie period of the agreement, it is possible that the present
agreement. can be extended for two months. This would
be advantageous to -the Cubans because during the first
two months of the year they-will be able to acquire all
the goods they will need for 1970, (QUDOZE,. 19 November).

Since AMAUTO42's separation from AMAUTO-1's housctiold and her
demigration to the United States with her husband, AMAUTO-5,
weno longer: havo, an-oporational interest.in her. As you

sreserae know, AHAUTO-3. was used solely as an intermediary for a warm

+ approach to AMAUTO-2, ‘This was accomplished, and we have had ©

no further contact with her. No Station contact was ever made

with AMAUTO~4.
2. After the departure of AHAUTO-2 from AMAUTO-1's

1 household, the Station soon learned of her replacement and

this information wos pagsed-to the QUSEQUIN’s. It was decided
that the QUSEQUINS would attempt to recruit the new domestic,
but for unknown reasons, contact was never sade. Wo believe
that there is a new domestic now working in the AMAUTO-1

household, but we have no details on her.

be very. useful to us in our relations (with the Spaniards). Before
bis arrival (in-Havana) wo: tried.to probe into the personality of”
ir:Torroba and; in ‘additiom to confirming the good opinion that

and that from this.angle he could be influenced despite his.

(word indistinct) personality. Tho position hé held as Deputy
Director of Consular. Affairs (in the Spanish Foreign Ministry)
was actually that ‘of advisor on-consular matters but he exercised
no authority. The idea of helping him in his work is apt and
could be carried to tho point where sone officer like himself

(of -siailar category) could intimidate him in such a way that

his weakness of character and susceptibility to outside influence
vould serve our purposes. There is no doubt that an attack
against Sr. Torroba in the way of making his task more difficult
would bring as an immediate result a greater influence on the
part of thoso who are interested in having him become a (vord

even in the event that his work shculd not prove to ke the best,
that another officer could be substituted that (word or vords

In order to. resolve the question of handling from this
Babassy the departure of tho (word indistinct), please clarify
the reason why there hag bocn.a aiSinterpretation. iverything
to tho problems of Spain and Cuba through this Babassy will, of
course, redound to our benefit. A clear case is the application
for departure of (word indistinct) and his statenwent that perhaps

4. As'a recruitment target, hovever, AHAUTO-1 seems to ~
present serious difficulties, He is strong-ainded, opinionated,
idealistic, aad apparently committed to the revolution. On, the
other hand, there are certain things about him which could be
converted into recruitment vulnorabilitics. First apc these
“18 bis apparent belsef‘tnat the regime (read: the Revolution)
AS Not makingthe best use of his talents. (Qne cannot tell.
precisely svethér. this is the ¢ause or result of his apparent
basic emotional Anstability.. . During. public appearances he
‘displays polished manners and a pro-regine attitude; .in private
he frequently complains to Hig subordiantes that he did not ask
for a diplomatic position, that he-would prefer an industrial
Job, and’ that he believes his’ position to be more a handicap
than a promotion. Secondly, he obviously desires personal
Prestige and luxutious: Tiving. While these traits do not. mean
“80-Buch fz @ Cuban as compared to'a Soviet or

fact*e Contrast ‘with his basic impulses: Third1 , his

vulnerabilities which further target study could expose,

are fully awate of other operational pressures on|

couments on further development of AMAUTO=1 as an in-place
recruitnient target. ‘The firat need would be the proper access
agent, someone with a-Jesuit-like intellectual training who can
deal with him in the reala of concepts and philoscphy as required.
In any case, we would like continued target reporting on AMAUTO-1,,
