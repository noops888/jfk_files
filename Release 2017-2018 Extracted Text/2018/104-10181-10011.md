a convinced supportor of the Castro

is evidence to dispute this image.

An analysis of available information

indicates that he is not a convinced

discipline, and that his character

is basically incoupatible with the

systen he serves.

His father is reported to be an old

the intermediary must be intelligent

3.

ASAUTO-1 confides in for people.

From our reading

of QUTINID and QUDOZE, there are at least three persons

who could fontral and cilectively fill the sole as an

internediary.

They

are identities d. B, and C.

We can

categorically climinate

Identity A for obvious

rcasons, 1.c.,

lack of

direct access to him.

Because of his

relationship

to Identity.

we can also

te presents " Misk which we are

tentatively climinate Identity B.

not certain should be taken;

however, we would like to

add & comment on him

in a later

paragraph.

Identity C would secm

to be the most logical

choice.

He is intelligent, a professional man,

well-to-do,

joung and one with whom AlAUTo-l frequently

talks and whom

he often sees He know little about his political proclivities

although he gives the impression of being a moderate analyst

of world events and doesn't seem to have a strong affection

or aversion for the PERINEN Government.

He have a good

background on him prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;

however,

as you can well imagine,

the report concentrates on

the economic side of the individual.

We have made a number

of attempts. here in thel

to determine whether he has

any American contacts, but with negative results:

His visa

file does not show where he visited in the United States or

the purpose, except that it was a business trip.

He has an

indefinite visa

and we are fairly certain that,

if necessary,

we could

• use

the question of his visa as an entre to him.

Ne are

currently reviewing with all Station assets their

knowledge of

Identity C.

In addition,

we are also considering

assets such as QUEASH-1 and QUSPOT-1,

sho could, under some

legitimate business pretext, contact

Identity C.

Our objective

is to develop a warm

entree

to Identity C without compromising

any

but we are in need of an assessment of

Identity C by

of our agentder a Station Officer of an asset working

under an officer's instructions.

We will keep you advised of

oui progress.

We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate

cover.

A POA on Identity C was requested separately. There

are no derogatory Station traces.

Ideniity B would be an excellent choice if not for

his relationship with Identity D.

This avenue might be explored

with QUSEQUIN-18 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint

operation.

QUSEQUIN-18 could probably get the necessary

clearances from Identity D directly,

or from one of Identity D's

aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until

we receive your comments.

5.

It is not too early to consider the emoluments we

might want to offer to AMUTO-1 at the time a pitch

is made.

As always they should be divided into two areas . for defection

and for recruitment and work in place.

The PBRUMEN government has approved the construction

of a new office building to be used as an Embasay,

Comercial office and residence for the PBRUMEY Miniates.

The site has been identifled and work is expected to begin

soon, probably aster

the return of AMAUTO»1 from PBRUMEN,

The builders expoct

to

complete the building within eight months.

2.

QUSEQUIN-37 is far nure confident than we are, about

the possibility of getting access to the building during the

construction phase to possibly install various audio devices.

He believe':this operation to be a formidable one and we might

bo challenged by the presence

JOR PBRUMEN security

forces overseeing the construction, the presence of PBRUEN

electricians

and other professions, complicating the accese

to the building.

Wo believe AMAUTO-1 has the

experience well 1a wind and sost likely will do everything

within his pover to overcome the possibility of an audio

penetration of his building.

3.

Fe would be grateful for any information addressees

might have on the general modus operandi of PBRUMEN security

forces in areas where PBRUHEN official installations bave been

constructed.

Have they used PBRUMEN technicians, electricians,

construction engineers,

etc?

Also we would like

to know whether

the PBRUMANS have installed their own telephone system or have

they generally telled on the systen of the host country.

commercial office, the Cubana

Visa delays.

Havana is consistently

late in processing vian requests for foreignora

traveling to Cuba.

Ruiz attributed the delays

to the red tape which involves processing the

requests through two ministries;

The Visa Section

in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the

Directorate of Immigration in the Ministry of

Interior.

Ruiz requested authorization for the

consulate to send its visa requests directly to

the Directorate of Immigration since this is. the

sectton that ultimately determines whether a

a very dangerous game. "

MATOS:

I don't know what you mean, miss.

NILDA: Well, because none of the comrades here is going

to allow himself to be provoked. So, please

do not keep on."

MATOS:

Well, I don't know what you are referring to,

miss, I am completely astonished.'

NILDA:

Well look, don't be astonished, you might end

MATOS: I don't know what you are talling about.

NILDA: Kell, we do.

there has been a misunderstanding.

MATOS:

NILDA: Didn't you make a date with the Charge d'Affaires?

NILDA:

Who are 'they'? To whom do you refer when you say

MATOS: I was called on behalf of the Ambassador of Chile

extremely unusual, miss, because 'I don't know anyone

MATOS: I live with a daughter and you must realize that

I live only for her.

NILDA: Well, look, if you live for her, don't get mixed

Guillermo RUIZ. Pérez

DOB: Late January. or early February 1930.

• POST: Minister Plenipotentiary, accredited

since 12 December 1967.

ADDRESS: Juan de Mena 18, Madrid.

TELEPHONES: 259-5956 (home), 221-7028 (office).

DOI : March 1970.

WIFE: NIlda VECIANA. Probably in her early thirties,

she, is pregnant and was due to have her sixth child

in May 1970. However, her physician recommended

forced labor (reasons unknown), which was scheduled

for 17 April 1970. She has had difficulties with

her pregnancy because of recurring fainting spells

and overweight, which are being treated by Dr. HER-

NANDEZ and DE. MATA ( the latter ordered lab tests

for Diabetes, the results of which are unknown).

Married for 16 yeare to Guillermo, Nilda

is a pleasant woman who has not been known to

quarrel openly with her husband or express

political or religlous opinions, although in

this last respect she has recited the Lord's

Prayer in front of Embassy personnel, which

suggests that she may have been or is a practicing

Catholic.

Mrs. Ruiz 1s a language teacher by profession

( speaks English

fluently), and is active in

the Embassy as secretary to

her husband and book

keeper, but only on an informal basis.

Of rather weak personality L Exception,

family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar [in

to work when he was only 14 years old.

In the fifties he emigrated to the United

States, travelling throughout the East Coast

and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to

work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-

American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a

grocery store on Flagler St. in Miami. He

did so well in attracting Latin-American customers

to the store that he soon began to distribute

meat in the area for SAMKO.

He has said that when he left Miami

Carreras, then another Cuban exile; were in contact

with an American of Cüban descent known as Joe LOUIS

or LUIS, an underworld figure who was competing

with the Icallans in the bolita racket in Tampa.

RUIZ himself has told close associates that LUIS

or LOUIS offered them $800 a month, plus car and

expenses, to supervise "collections", in Miant.

Furthermore, LOUIS or LUIS even asked them

to kill a man named FERNANDEZ, Who was involved

in the numbers game in Miami, for $5000 each.

SAMKO went to Havana, where he stayed for a

EDUCATION : Aside from the statistics course

taken in 1960, RUIZ seems to lack, in the ayes

of some observers, a solid, formal education.

But he makes up for it by being an avid reader

(five newspapers a day, plus books). This impression,

however, may be wrong,

for there are Indications

that he either studied or wanted to be a CrA:

He understands and speaks English and

French (fluency unknown), and has undertaken

to teach grammar to the embassy staff.

Sensitive to art, or so he says, he

frequently complains of the general lack of

culture in Cuba. His vocabulary level is rather

low, cussing quite often in the presence of

others.

RUIZ Is well-versed In world affairs,

and does have an understanding of international

trade.

He has read some of the works of José Marti,

whom he likes to quote. But there is another

book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PRILBY's,

the KGB spy who penetrated MI-6.

He is up-to-date on current intelligence

publications.

RUIZ is known to be suffering from an undisclosed

liver illness for which he takes a medicine called

bilidis. Late in 1969 he was planning to go to

Portugal on vacation following the advice of his

physician, out he did not make the trip. He coughs

should have as Minister Plenipotentiary (relations

He is involved in and kept Informed of

relations, Including trade. He does not permit

commercial attachés to bypass him when they

submit reports to their respective enterprises

In addition, he supervises Cubana Alr.

Madrid for consultations with RUIZ ("

Our relations

Spanish officials or factories, and only 'he,

On another occasion he complained to

Aristides DIAZ that he had received one more

critical report from Havana because the Embassy.

"had not achieved wuch," although they had done

things that were not included in the yearly

plan.

But perhaps the most serious censure of

his activities came in by telex (" Why worry?

The Americans and the Spaniards intercept all

messages anyway") early in October 1969. Havana

questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade

regotiations with the Spanish Government. L The

trade agreement was extended by mutual consent

to 31 December 1972,7

In his reply addressed to Raúl LEON Torras,

first vice-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban

official directly responsible for the talks,

Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed"

and "consulted" in rather strong language.

Therefore, he rejected that his cable number 521

was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade

official who had been the source of the complaint.

In the last paragraph he cold Raúl LEON

Evidently this last cable upset him so

much that he was nervous and particularly

security-conscious.

Less than a week later,

he called Raúl LEON Torras and requested

permission to go to Cuba, ostensively to

settle a "personal problem with my son."

When he returned to Madrid on 29 October

he was a changed man, again fully confident

of himself. Nevertheless, he has told close

friends that he feels very lonely in Spain

and has had the desire to simply board a plane

and return to Cuba abandoning the Embassy.

Late in January 1970 he was again de

pressed,

for he felt like an "exile" to

Spain after two years of service (" Even

though LEON played a part in my appointment

I cannot work for a man that I do not under

stand. Maybe he sent me abroad to get me out

of the way. I feel as 1f I were in Miami.")

He thinks he is "burned" in Spain, and

when he returns to the Island he will definitely

not go back to MINREX, but to MININT. He has

cold close friends his term in Spain is up and

he will be returning to Cuba probably in the

summer. In any event, he does not plan to be in

Spain more than nine months. Nilda, his wife,

has stressed that they are leaving Madrid permanently

in July 1970.

POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS: Although

outwardly a "revolutionary", Guillermo RUIZ

is a man of moderate political views struggling

But the most important revelation of

when he was quoted as telling & visiting DAP

that "religion should not be considered a

handicap for people trying

to return to Cuba."

On the other hand, he refers to Latin-

American diplomats ag "bootlickers" because

they use the English language in parties, and

has remarked that "capttalism is no good".

RUIZ seeme to have certain admiration for

Francisco FRANCO, who, in his view, is the only

reason why Spain has rot turned communist. Of

course, it 1s doubtful that he really believes

this.

He does not hide his favorable opinions

of the American people, who are "'frank" and

"simple".

"'They treated me very well," he

told Raul LEON Torras in December 1969.

On international matters he is up-to-

date and well-informed. Following are some

of his views, which are contradictory at times:

" Cuba la a political power, not a military

or economic power:

* The USSR has neutralized U.S. sea power

In the Mediterranean.

" Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever te

chooses to do so, although the base has lost its

strategic value to the United States.

" US-China rapproachment should be feared,

but also a Japan-China alliance.

economic point of view; secondly, because whether

particularly sensitive in this respect, which

perhaps could be traced to his probable involvement

with the DGI in one way or another.

He is quick

to warn visiting Cubans of the

CIA's efforts ("' La Compañla Sociedad Anónima" )

to compromise them, even before leaving Havana.

"Our Embassy," he says,

"is the primary target

for U.S. operations in Spain."

He keeps control of mail going to and

coming from Havana in the diplomatic pouch,

and states repeatedly that his office is

bugged and telephone tapped (" There are micro-

phones. here the size of olives"). In addition,

he thinks he is followed openly by Seguridad.

For all these reasons he has acked Ravana"

for funds to build a new embassy, where he plans

to have & shielded room free from microphones. ( The

building, which will cost approximately $600.000,

she could "lose her life".

RUIZ l1kes to recall the time when a Cuban

in his staff ( name unknown, but presumably he

is back in Cuba) spread the rumor that RUIZ

and Nilda were not well-liked in Havans, perhaps

to undermine his authority. CURBELO reprimanded

the man by stressing that "when Havana is doubtful

of anybody here in Madrid it uses official channels

to let ua know."

Nevertheless, he does make mistakes, as

evidenced by discussing in his office, with

members of his staff, the possibility of advising

Havana that a Spanish foreign service officer

scheduled for duty there might be open for

recruitment. Recalling his constant warnings

that his office is bugged by Seguridad, such

discussion clearly exposes him to expulsion

his capability in normal circumscances.

Nevertheless, from what can be seen bla

work in Spalo has been effective, and he keeps

a tight control over his scaff. He 1a a man

Precisely because of his privileged

status RUIZ 18 very careful in whatever he does,

avoiding mistakes that would endanger bis

position.

Therefore, he will probably resiat any

Indirect approach, which he will recognize 1a

But this does not mean that he is unapproachable,

for be is not. There is no question that his

personality is Incompatible with the system that

he serves, alchough with profound misgivings as

how and when.

The very fact chat he has made

open remarks

be a trap to compromise him, including a loyalty

test by the DGI..

Consequently, & direct approach has much

It would be proof for

hia that he is walking on firm ground by

dealing directly with Americans. Which leads

to the question of when There

are two key

factors to consider:

a) His recall to Cuba.

b) The 10-million ton sugar harvest, which

is scheduled to end on 15 July 1970.

RUIZ has indicated that he is unhappy in

his post--perhaps not really meaning what he

says--, which he has occupied for over two

years.

As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans

a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest,

he himself may be one of the targets. Assuming

chat bis ideological inconsistencles have been

noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof

regarding his loyalty and considering whatever

support he has in Havana, may request his

recall at an appropriate opportunity: during

a major reorganization of the Cuban Government.

In any event, RUIZ does not expect to

remain in Madrid much longer; and is planning

to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.

If Cuba is successful in harvesting 10

million tons of sugar, and they have already

reached air, the "victory" that Cuban propagandist

will herald

from July on may have a paychological

There secms little doubt that Nüll exercise the full

authority that presucably he should have as Minister Pleni-

remain static because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full

Ambassador to Cuba after LOJENDIO was expelled from the island

by CASTRO in 1959.

In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interesi in

Cubana operations: and he has said that no one may travel to

Havana on Iberia

without his permission.

He insists that Cuban

officials arriving in adrid consult with hin before arranging

visits to Spanish officials or factorics. He seems to have

(The tenor of his conversation secms to

"They think

11. In turn, he has also bech the target of criticism

from Havana,

first from Loila CONEZ (7), who made a critical

cvalu-

ation of the Embass.

RUIZ' reaction is instructive: "I decided

not to answer it.

all about it."

On another occasion

he complained

to Aristides

regarding his program for the Embassy.

that not nuch had

RuIz noted that the Embassy

to answer that particular criticism in detail.

12. Perhaps the most serious criticisn of his activities

characteristically keeping his actions correct, has stressed

to the Spanish that Cuba will not use the transmitter for other

than legitimate commercial purposes:

RUIZ cven offered to allow-

Spanish citizens to opcrate the

his point.

that he was

unhappy there, and RUI% asked on 16 October 1969 to go

to llavana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito.

If there were a problem,

it seens to have becn solved,

because Rule on his return quoted Guillernito as being

very happy in his new school.

Competent experts here guess that the medicine

and was planning to go for his health to the same

Gimnasio as his son, Alejandro.

A July 1968 monorandum for the record stated that RUI?

suffers from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall he had about

12 years ago..

Since then he has had chronic backaches which were

particularly

severc during the time that he

was in the u.s.,

Haiti, and

Santo Domingo.

treated by the Embassy's Spanish doctor VILLALANDA (Inu), who

prescrebed cortisone.

His condition was diagnosed as incurable,

since it was doubied that the injury to his spine could be

corrected by an opcration.

RuIt, was further told that the

condition would continuc to cow worse, and that within six to

en seat's he would have a defcctive walk.

RUIz, planned to send

-the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to

the Cuban specialist WARTINEZ-PAZ for revicw.

TRAVELS

Following

are the trips RUIZ is known to have made during

the last quarter of 1969:

To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car,

on 28 November 1969, returning tro

days later.

b.

To Havana,

to settlc "a personal problem," on

20 October 19G9 via

Iberia (first class), returning to

Madrid on 29 October:

C.

To London on 11 November for consultations

with

Raul LEON Torrcs, retwning two days later by air.

To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December

to pick up an Alla Romero that he bolight for the

CONTACTS IN MADRID

In late October or early Novenber 1969

CARRASCO went to New York.

c. Rosendo CANTO (201-719310) .

CANTO lives at Goya

His friendship with RUIZ is interesting, given

CANTO's background, because their being together could be

very dangerous for RUIZ inless he were using CANTO for

some reason with the approval of llavana.

Cuban Foreign Service.

Referring to CANTO's desire, RUIZ

On the other hand,

there appear to be very decy inconsisiencies in his publie

and private behavior:

A certain dogrce of racisa can be detected. in his

constant refrrence to bincks as

"niches,

a disrespectful

Cuban colloquialis roughly comparable with the pejorative

word,

"nigger."

37.

RUIZ almost never discusses women with his colleagues,

except for one off moment when he mentioned a girl he kncw

in the United States before the Revolution.

Perhaps RUIZ wisely

remembers

that Silda also works at the Embassy and refrains

from mentioning women on her recount. In any case, Stiff, "one

wonders about the custom of absenting himself by automobile

into the interior of Spain).

His habits secm to be simple: he likes movies; he

has read Topaz (but made no comment thercon); and he receives

people at his home for cocktails.

POLITICAL AND. IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS

39. Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ, gives much

more

the appearance of a man with noderate political views

struggling to justify to himself the actions of his govcinment,

especially in view of the political and cconomic realities of

his country:

It is possible

that his feclings might lie

closer to

the theory of the "betrayed revolution"

-=-but not

for strictly ideological reasons.

The incompetence of the

Cuban

governnental bureaucracy, for example, has sabotaged the

revolution.

10. In the first place,

RUIZ definitely does not scen

to be a Martist and consequently he cannot

accept

the role of

"robot" (lis term) required by Party discipline and vertical

structure.

On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo

DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX official:

"Revolutionaries

should not be coerced by forms of political control."

b. On 11 December 1969 he told a visiting

Agropecuario

official from Havana that:

disagiee with orders, I question

... not a robot not do T

the mentality of one.

of possible interest b addressees is a translation of

the following

letter dictated by Guillermo RUIL Perez to his

secretary on 26 December 1969-

The letter was addressed

to &

comrade "OCUZA or LANUZA (fon) in Havana in response to a confi

dental note received by RUIZ from Havana.

"In relation to your confidential note number

7240 about the Spanish prisoners, Joaquin AUVI Casals,

Lazaro GARRIDO Sanchez and Antonio MARQUEZ Pedraza, whose

release was requested in a note from the Spanish Embassy

in Havana, I would like to tell you the following:

Firstly,

Senor Joaquin AUVI Casals was. of interest to

D. Pedro SALVADOR de Vicente; but because of the bad

record and activities of this man, it was understood

that his departure would be denied..... I talked to Pedro

SALVADOR about this matter and upon mentioning

this

man's background he told me that his interest was due

to a phone call he had received from a friend of his in

Miami.

He considers that, given the background in this

case,

his friend

was supposedly an instrument of

"other

interests".

Secondly,

regarding the other spaniards

we have no objection whatsoever to their departing the

country.

Without anything of further consequence,....."

SOURCE

1.

On 23

September 1969 the Cuban Minister to Spain,

Guillermo

Ru i z. Perez, called on Pedro

Salvador

de Vicente, the Special Delegate for Latin American Affairs.

in the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

to discuss the

forthcoming trade

negotiations in Cuba

During the

discussion

Salvador told Ruiz that the one and only question which con

cerns the Spanish Government is that of Cuban indemnifications

and pensions for Spanish

employees, and he asked Ruiz what the

Intter could say regarding this probiem.

(Field Comment:

The

indemnifications refer to property owned by Spanish nationals

which was

confiscated by the Cuban Government.)

Ruiz claimed

that he had no

instructions on what he could say, adding that

the claims were

numerous and that the paperwork involved was

difficult and required i great deal of time.

2.

Salvador told Ruiz that the subject of indemnifica-

tions and pensions must be discussed during the forthcoming

negotiations,

and that the Cuban Government must provide at

least an approximate figure. of what

it

is going to pay.

said

that the indemnification figure must be based on the

value

of

the expropriated properties, less the amount of any

taxes levied

on the properties.

(Source Comment:

Salvador

did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government falled

to reach some agreement on

the question but he implied that

negotiations would be delayed until the Spanish Foreign

Ministry

received the Cuban Government's reply to this

question.)

Salvador

and Ruiz was held

As of IT' November 1969. Salvador was still

Special Delegate for Latin American Affairs.

3.. (Field Comment:

Until recently, the indemnifications

'and"

pinsions problen had not emerged as

i serious factor in

the negotiations for a new trade agreement.

There has been

•a gradual detcrioration of Spanish-Cuban commercial relations

since the conclusion in May of preparatory negotiations for

a new agreement, but this detcrioration ostensibly was the

result of a Spanish Government decision to reduce Cuban sugar

imports over the next three years.

The Cuban Government

apparently: had not considered such decision in its inalysis

of Cuban-Spanish commercial relations, and it was quite.

upset when the decision was revealed during the preparatory

negotiations

Some of the problems. causing the strain in

Spanish-Cuban relations were previously reported in

[MICROFILA

The following comments of AMAUTO-1 reflect Cuban thoughts

on the Czechoslovaquian situation'in the Spanish Government

internal Spanish politics,

and the effects of recent changes

on the impending trade negotiations between Spain and Cuba.

a.:

The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has

been a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action

would mean taking sides with the Americans.

A friend

may be criticized in private but publicly he should be

defended.

(QUDOZE, 19 November.). The Cubans have to

side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons

and because, whether right or wrong,

they belong to

the

same ideological camp.

Cuba had and still has

enormous

discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the

United States but weighing the diffcrences Cuba is with

Communism as opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZE, 3 November.)

b.

AMAUTO-1 was asked by his government to report

on the

new Spanish Government which Havana

calls "Opus

Dei".

To a visiting Cuban official he admitted that

he was at a loss

to understand Spanish politics but

attempted to define them.

It 1s

not

true that the

Spanish Government is in the hands

of the Opus Del.

There are some men

in the

government who lean. toward the

Opus Dei but there are others

of a

very different Icaning

because they come from the Falangist ranks.

These men

(the Falangists) may go along with the Opus Del line

because they allow

themselves to be "carried by the tide"

but they are not of the Opus Dei. (CUDOZE, 19 November.)

C.

Concerning the impending trade negotiations

with Spain, in ardition to the

economic problem

the

Cubans are now faced with another impediment which

further delays the negotiations:

the recent changes

in the Spanish goverament.

It is difficilt at this

time for the Cubans

because:of

to approach any Spanish official

of confusion among

them.

Most

Spanish officials have no idea as to whether they will

remain in their posts or will be replaced.

it is futile

Therefore,

for the Cubans to press them for action

on the negotiations.

The most they can do is wait

patiently until the situation

is normalized.

If the

negotiations are not held within the 30-day expiration

period of the agreement, it is possible that the present.

agreement can be extended. for two months.

This would

be advantageous to the Cubans because during the first

two months of the year they will be able to acquire all

the goods they will need for 1970. (QUDOZE, 19 November).

The study being made öf the activities of Mr. Juin Torroba

on the part of (vord indistinct), give us a direct insight Into

the activities of the Spanish Embassy there (in Cuba) which could

De vory usefül to us in our relations (with the Spanlards).

Before

his arrival (in Havana) we tried to probe into the porsonality of

Ir. Torroba and, in addition to confirming the good opiniou that

Spantards have of his, ve learned that he is voak in character

and that fron this angle he could be influenced despito hia

(vord indistinct) personality.

Tho position be held as Doputy

Director of Consular. Affairs (in the Spanish Foreign Ministry)

was actually that of advisor on consular matters but he exorcised

no authority.

The iden of helpiny him in his work is apt and

could be

carrled to the point where some officer like himself

(of siallar category) could intinidate him in such a way that

his weakness of character and susceptibility to outside influence

vould serve our purposes.

There is no doubt that an attack

would bring as an immediate result a greater influence on the

part of tboso tho are Interested in having him bocone a (word

On the other hand ve do not consider it possible

sabassy the departure of the (word indistinct), please clarily

1: On 23 September 1969 ANAUTO-1 called an unidentified

Spanish woman

who resided in Cuba for many

turning

years before re-

to: Spain. AMAUTO-1 noted that he visited the Spanish

woman's cousin,

identified as Esther CORRIPIO, while he vacationed

in PBRUNEN: and found everyone in good health.

The unidentified

Spanish woman asked AVAUTOl if there was much food available

and the following dialogue began:

AMAUTO-1:

Yes,

everything is being resolved.

But

imagine to be free,

one must pay

a high price and the price must be

paid. There is no other way.

ROMAN:

ALAUTO-1:

What one wants, one must pay:

It is very logical, but look,

when

one

is a servant to the rich, the servant

usually lives relatively

well, but the

servant continues as

servant. However,

when one no longer wants to be a servant

to the rich, one has to begin saving and

the only way there is for the poor to

save is to reduce (the intake) of essential

foods, change the essential and begin

to buy machines and to buy a series of

things (cuestiones) and one day, we will

• become rich together,

We can say we are

rich when we have resolved all the problems,

not only material problems,

but spiritual,

cultural, that is, when everyone can do

and believe as he likes.

"HOLAN:

Oh! I don't do anything but talk of

Cuba

and I adore the

country.

I have

a brother there who is a nurse and he

says he

is fine.

AMAUTO-1:

Cuba gets into your blood.

Then

saw Erther she

was

was a little thin,

but

in good health.

We think the

passion for the good life.

above is another good example of ALAUTO 1'g

. While he appears patriotic and :

openly supports the regime,

we continue to believe that he would

prefer a return to the relative freedoms enjoyed by his country

men before the

start of the revolution,
