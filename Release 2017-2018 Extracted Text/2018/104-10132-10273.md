1. In his book, Give Us This Day ("The Inside Story of

the CIA and the Bay of Pigs Invasion..."), on pages 98-103,

Everett Howard HUNT, JI., gives an account of some of the

activities of Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ who defected from Castro

Cuba in mid-1959 as the first chief of Castro's air force.

HUNT points out that in October 1959 DIAZ LANZ piloted a

snall plane dumping hundreds of anti-Castro leaflets over

Havana.

DIAZ LANZ's copilot on the flight is identified as

Frank FIORINI, aka:

Frank STURGIS. HUNT goes on to describe

what would appear to be personal contacts with DIAZ LANZ in

the Miami area, utilizing the services of Bernard BARKER In

his contacts with DIAZ LANZ and other Cubans•

HUNT further

describes his attempts to involve DIAZ LANZ with the Agency

in the invasion, but HUNT's overtures were not accepted by

Headquarters. The concluding paragraph-of-this account states:

"After the invasion the Kennedy Administration

could not do enough for Manuel RAY. A cozy post

was secured for him in Puerto Rico as Chief of

Munoz Marin's housing projects. I am sure that no

equal effort was

made in behalf of Pedro Luis DIAZ

LaNd, for our national tradition has become one of

Shabby discrinination against known anti-Conmunists."

NOTE: HUNT's contacts with DIAZ LANZ occurred.

during the period circa October 1960 to circa

November 1961 while HUNT was assigned to JMARC,

Miami.

concern Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ but reveal no use of DIAZ LANZ

in the Cusan invasion or other Agency operational matters.

File #202 923 concerns Marcos DIAZ LANZ, the brother of

Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ.

The file reflects that Marcos DIAZ

LANZ was she Deputy Chief of Castro's air force until his

defection in July 1959, effected by this Agency by his

exfiltration from Cuba

clandestinely. For the purposes of

instant nenorandum, it is of note that this file contains an 06, 08

Agency Information

Report stating, "According to Colonel Oscar

MORALES Lopez, Chief of Aviateca--the Guatemalan government-

owned airline-fommandante Pedro Luis DIAZ LAVZ, former inspector

of the Cuban

rebel airforce, Captain Sergio DIAZ, and Captain

Frank FIORINI, also fornerly with the rebel airforce, arrived

in Guatemala on 30 December (1959) and immediately contacted

They had a card from the Guatenalan Ambassador in

Washington and said that they had been in the United States

the first part of December and had talked with important

officials of the governnent.

The three wanted to talk with

President Miguel YDIGORAS Fuentes to obtain moral support for

their anti-Castro activities."

There is information showing

the mutual involvement of Frank FIORINI with the DIAZ LANZ

brothers in anti-Castro activities until at least the summer

of 1963.

Infornation in the file of Frank Anthony STURGIS,

aka:

Frank FIORINI (#353 459), reflects that from circa

May 1960 to at least January 1961, STURGIS was living in the

Miani area training a group of Cuban and American volunteers

for a military invasion of Cuba.

By October 1960, the FBI

had determined that STURGIS's only activities in anti-Castro

matters were in conjunction with the activities of Pedro DIAZ

LANZ, who was one of the leaders of the anti-Castro group,

Reportedly, STURGIS' invasion group

in January 1961 was calling itself, "Brigada Internacionale,"

with variations of "International Anti-Communist Brigade" and

"Anti-Conmunist International Brigade."

One of the sub-units

of the "Brigade" was identified in the press in July 1961 as

being

a paratroop unit called "Intercontinental Penetration

Force' or INTERPEN.

The Commander of INTERPEN was identified

as Gerald Patrick HEMING, JI., (*429 229) • The Office of

Security file of STURGis contains nothing

further until October

1968, when his arrest was announced in October 1968--while still

heading the "International Anti-Connunist Brigade"-- for his

involvenent in a group attempting to enter Guatemala to

"clean out anti-Guatenalan guerrillas." At that time FIORINI

claimed that two men who were sponsoring his operation were

Bob HOWELL, allegedly a friend of the Kennedy family, and a

General BIDDLE, menber of the (John) Birch Society.

To return to the events of the early 1960's, in

July 1952 an article appeared in the New Orleans States Item

by Bill STUCKEY, concerning an anti-Castro training base

the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.

HEMMING, ST.

The article inferred that INTERPEN was still.

part of

Frank FIORINI's (STURGIS) "International Anti-Commnist

Brigade."

This particular unit received nationwide publicity

in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney GARRISON alleged

that INTERPEN was involved in the assassination of President

Johr F. KENNEDY and that INTERPEN members were connected with

CIA.

5.

The above noted Bill STUCKEY who wrote the July 1962

press article about INTERPEN and HEMING is identical with the

William STUCKEY who interviewed Lee Harvey OSWALD

during a public

broadcast in New Orleans

in August 1963:

According to testimony

in the Warren Conmission hearings by William STUCKEY and Carlos

3RINGUIER (Cuban Student Directorate delegate in New Orleans).

in early August 1963, Lee Harvey OSWALD came to BRINGUIER'S

New Orleans clothing

store announcing that he, OSWALD, was a

to join

an anti-Castro

guerrilla group in New Orleans.

and OSWALD and BRINGUIER were arrested. BRINGUIER subse-

quently alerted STUCKEY to OSWALD which resulted in the broadcast

interview.

It is of note that BRINGUIER inferred he was know

ledgeable of the anti-Castro guerrilla group training on the

north shore of Lake Pontchartrain and even collected funds for

the travel of two of the members to Miami when the group was

disbanded.

6. The individual in INTERPEN of most interest to GARRISON

was Loran Eugene HALL, aka: Lorenzo PASCILLO, aka:

GARRISON also alleged that HALl was involved with the

"Minutenen."
