Jo; Ing turned over the

lotter to MIRABAL.

MIRABAl, seemed to feel he had a hot potato on his hands, was very u

comfortable and even a bit scared and

sald, "I'll have to discuss

this with the Ambassador," (L9) notes that MIRABAL 1s cowardly.

timorous, not at all. like his prodecessor AZCUS who was the epitome

of self confidence and control. (LI)finds this Interesting since ALCUE

was not a Cormnist and HIRABAL 13 - the Carunist 1s really the

weakling In spite of all the strength that supposedly comes fron

knowing that Mards-Ieninism 1s right.)
