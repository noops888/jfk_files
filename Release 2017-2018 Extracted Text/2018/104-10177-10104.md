dsted 5 Septezber 1953, vhich was zeceived.in CI/OA on 9 September
1953. “In response to a priority need as expressed vy the Division,

& Provisicnal Operational Approval for operational use was granted
crtlly on the basis of Subject's recent staff and contract employment
with this Agency. Imuedfate approval ves issued also on the basis

of an oral report fro. the Office of Security to the effect that
