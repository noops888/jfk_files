REFERENCE: (A) HNMA-4315, 17 April 1969

(B) HNMA-4324, 1 May 1969

Attached (USC) for the information of Headquarters is a

of a memorandum prepared for the INPURE Chief on 12 May 1969.

copy memorandun sets forth information rece. ved that day by the

JAMBIDDY-1 who is considering going into a dry dock venture

In Corinto with Jose Maria ZELAYA, private secretary to President

Somoza.

ZELAYA has cabinet rank.

He is believed by many to be

pro-Communist although, as in the caze of similar reports about

Francisco J. LAINEZ, no real proof of these arlegations seems to

De produced.

When shown this memorandum,

the LNPURE Chief said he

thought it quite likely that ZELAYA

is strongly anti-American

a reported by AMBIDDY.

3.

AMBIDDY says that for the first time he recently heard

Somoza utter unfavorable words about the United States

and

AMBIDDY "wondered®

TIf ZELAYA could be exerting some

avil influence on Somoza.

will seek to draw AMBIDDY out at length on

thia matter at

The Ambassador

12 May 1969

Political Attaché

Statements of Jose Maria "Chena" ZELAYA

1.

on 12 May I was contacted by

a close friend of mine

who is engagic in negotiations with "Chema" ZELAYA which

may lead to the twe forming a business partnership.

my source is not nurmally a source of intelligence informa-

tion, I have found him to be a good observer and to be

reliable.

He told me that ZELAYA told him the following

at a meeting on 9 May.

? The ROCKEFCLLER vinit is merely a political maneuver

on the part of President NIXON to furnish

an excuse if

anything goes wrong in Latin America.

It is preposterous

to expect Governor

ROCKEFLLER tO

learn anything about a

country in twenty four hours.

ROCKEFELLER Will

go back to

the United States, make his report to VIXON, and then go about

hio. normal duties.

NIXON will adopt those recommendations

Contrary to popular belief, Subject does not own

• piece of the Vizcaya restaurant

in

Miami although he

could have been a partner had he made a $500

investment

when the enterprise began.

The owners are Oscar VILA,

Aramis PINON, and the cook, named Tomás (Inu).

VILA

and PINON were with Subject in the Bay of Pigs invasion

and both are old friends.

VILA has been rumored involved

In narcotics but Subject doesn't think he is.

Some time

ago the Miami Herald sent its lady gourmet reporter to do a

atory on the Vizcaya.

She found it to her liking and wrote

• favorable story but some unidentified character at the

Herald told her that narcotics were pushed at the Vizcaya

und that Subject was one of the owners.

Publisher KNIGHI

of the Herald had an investigation run before allowing the

gourmet reporter's story to be printed.

The restaurant

was given a clean bill of health and the story was run.

10o

One of tha persons most prominently involvad in

blackening Subject's name is Rolando MASFERRER.

Subject

classifies him as the scum of Batista's Cuba.

One gets the

impression that Subject would be unhappy if MASFERRER, who

Subjeot says has been involvad in narcotics trafficking

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Hanuel AS. IHE Buesa

1..

ARTIME comes to Managua frequently, always using

LANICA Airliner

and frequently flying over Cuba.

He is

aware of the possibility of a highjacking and says that he

would never make it nut of the Havana airport alive if

the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him.

2.

He explains his trips as legitimate business.

One of his enterprises lies in obtaining fatigue uniforms,

canteens, web gear,

and similar equipment and supplies

for the Nicaraguan

National Guard®

Another enterprise,

In which he was involved a year or so ago,

Involved lumber

and cabinet woods which he hoped to export from Nicaragua

to the States.

He

dealt with a 'Nicaraguan businessman

named MOLINA in this matter:

It seens to have fallen through.

At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME wae trying

to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in

Germany here.

I have heard no more about this. A more

recent line is Nicaraguan beet. for export to the States.

He says that he has made contact with the top man of the

$ & W restaurants in the States. This man, after checking

amples of Nicaraguan beef, says he will buy all he can get.

the supplier at

thn

end would be CARNIC, a meat packing

interprise owned by President SOMOZA.

(There is no doubt

ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may

be stymied by the import quotas

ARTIME often stays at his

"El Gallego" ABLANEDO now. lives in Managua and makes his

living renting out dump trucks and construction and hauling

equement.

On one occasion ARTIME Came by with a Cuban I

believe was named VILA.

Mirta PADRON, another mutual

Cuban friend (she teaches Spanish at the American Embassy)

tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in Miami but that

ARTIME has no connection with

this enterprise.

A couple

of times ARIIME. has come by with Frank CONDOM, A short,

CONDOM is now pretty well-off financially and is

a good friend and business associate of "Bebe" REBOZO;

In turn, is a close friend

of President NIXON.

belleve CONDOM and, perhaps REBOZO, may be involved in the

nat dead.

4..

ARTIME always comes with sor-sone when he visits

n-not because he feels need for a bodyguard as some

suspect, but simply because he still doesn't know how to

drive a car and I live some distance out of town.. Our

visite are pleasant, involve a scotch or two at most.

The last two times ARTIME has not had anything to drink.

We talk no operations or other such business.

My personal

views on dealing with CASTRO, especially on howwe should

have dealt with him in the past, are rather hawkish and I

think ARTIME finde these views pleasant to his ear although

he is well aware that they are not "policy."

5.

ARTIME told me some months ago--before the electiong-

of meeting with "Bebe" REBOZO.

The meeting was arranged

through CONDOM,

he would do well to get into trim if he hopes to lead in

He is mature and quite objective. Car:

Current Rumors in PBRUMEN Exile Commnity

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

interest

230 10083.253

1.

As usunl the first month of 1969 featured a large number of rumors

making the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile community.

While we normally tend

to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they

relate to GPVALIANT.

2. The first of these rumors deals wich a new group which has pre-

sumably been formed for the purpose of trying to deal through GiVAklaNle

Among those in the group are Carlos Prio,

Lincoln Rodon, Juan . Remos,

Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari-

This group reportedly meets every Thurs-

day at different houses:

The last meeting in January was held at the home

of Lincoln Rodon.

At this meering Prio presumably stated that Burari was

« better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando.

The general

consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business

partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT.

The rumor mill has it that the group intends to pretend that it favors

political and democratic solutions to the PBRUMEN problem but that they

really seek armed intervention. In this same connection Father O'Fartil

has recently told AMPALM-A that AMBIDDY-] is once more connected with WOFIRM

and that ANCORE-2 has joined him.. The rumor mill says. further that AMBIDDY-1

and ANCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit

encouragement of the-above group. According to AMPALM-A O'Farril himself

does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-l and ANCORE-2 wanting to estab-

lish training camps.

O'Farril feels that the solution AMBIDDY-l is looking

for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.

3.

through AMPALM4. He also has reported the existence of this group and

said that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy army

and equipment to ovezuirow ANTHUG-1. According to WIBALDA important mem-

bers of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor, and Ortodoxos are in-

volved even though these organizations themselves are not participating

as groups in the one.

5. The bove information is being forrarded strictly as unfounded

and unconfirmed rumors.

le are passing it along only because it represents

another indication of what the exiles are expecting from GALiAsT.

that it may be an outgroth of the recent report we. have received from

MIAMI, 24 APF11 1967:

DOMI

Pardon my lateien 1a writing to you but I have had to face

many problems and I vanted to be calm then I vrote to you.

I was at Lulla Somosa's funeral and I thial that I mado a good

I-I also think that the Security Corps which continues to function

under the orders of Montiel, o 1s also chief of Staff and almo

cannot dedicate mificient time to

for the job.

#I thint that the only good thing that panorama has 1e the loyalty

mome of the high officials.

"Jon Formandes unde the contact with the Nicaragun sirl Who

roceived the proposition to study on a cholmahip in lumin, ut

with us. I save the contaot to Carlos.

"10 locording to reports fron Pepo Fernandon the "comrades" ure

going to try to intenally their ''Infiltrative Job" ln the Nicaraguan

departmentalit of Blueation and Agrarian reform.

The following is expected after 2 May, the day on which Tacho is

worn in: sabotage, terrorian, and kidnappings. Provocations!

1] I sincerely think, and excuse me, that the United States should

now, due so the paychological stass 1n which Tacho is in, demonstrate

that they have confidence in him Ill and in the success of his

Government. He la grateful to the United States for the help

which the United States sent to iln no that he could save his

brother, therefore take advantage of this.

12-Aocording to the comments whinh I heurd in Tacho's close circles

(Col. Sanchez from Innios, Ges, Cantlo Goalales; eto), Seville Sachsa

1u not in very good standing with Tacho, I think that Waahtngton.

should become friendly with taoho in a direot manner.

1. I was displeased when our Nicaraguan friend discussed

the subject of the implements which we had in Blueffield

with General Somoza before I had discussed anything with

him (Genral Sonoza); above all without even consulting

with me before he went shead and did it, this put me in

& difficult position with the Government. This is what I

discussed witt. Carlos:

me on consulting with the company, and the answer he fave

to (b) was that fill he planted the "other Iriend" in with

Somozs, and nothing else was sald. Thank God tht I did

woll on that Job, and I did pass some unpleasant moments.

2,Dur1ng Somozas' stay in the USA I have seen him frequently

and I have taken American Investors, who wish to put their

cryiral to work in Nicaragus, to see him. He bave conversed

sopiously about his projecte. He wante to do the following:

Iarmers the chance to take their products to big markets,

through the construction of highways, silos to store grains

and favorable legislation for the snall farmers. The

only thing that worries me is the extraordinary influence

that "Che Lainez" has on him in economics. There are

diverse comentaries about this individual on whether he is

& member of the Communist Party or not; but the truth 18

(I know him personally) that he 1s a social outcast, bitter,

Every intelligent and very ambitious. furthermore, when

he tries to please someone he acts like their servant. If

3. Somora has promised me to continue to move the subject

0$ Cuba in the Irternational 'spheres, and in his appearance

In moot the Press" he has already done 1t.

" There 18 a 'GARCIA" who is a syndicate lender of the

wharfs? of New York, who through Adolfo Jimenez told me

"bout a new invasion that was planned for Halti, directed

by me and leaving from Nicaragua.. I responded sogativoly.

It seems that they spoke with others about the project and

• gumor started which said that I was preparing an invasion

01 Halti from Nicaragus; I then went to see the Faitian cons:

In Miams to make 1t clour to him and his Government that 1

was not an adventurer, and that neither I nor the Nicaraguan

Government had the lightest intention of interfering with

Duvalier.

The consul has now told sa trat Duvalier wishes to speak

with me. I told him that I would be glad to speak with him

when he wished and when the interview would be kept secret.

I think that this interview could be useful, for I bave

found that the Haltian Government has a grudge against the

U.S. I do not know what we will speak about but I think

that I can get some good information for you (plural).

5. I think that we can expect violent revolts in Nicaragua,

In Panama, 1n Guatemala, and in Honduras (the opposition 18.

In possession of many arms that have not been found

yot).

This breakout of guerrilla warfare in Bolivia and Brasil

demonstrates Fidel's desperate strategy in trying to

mtart other Vietnans in America whether or not Fussia 18

in reement •

I think that the dismissal of Raul Castro and Vilma Espin

from the key posts in Cuban Communism can cause an internal

revolt in diesgreement between Cuban Communist elements and

we have to be on alert in order to take advantage of the

event no that it will not surprise as the "bloody rebellion

and cultural revolucinn of China" surprised us.

I bellove that propaganda for CUBA should be

centered on

planting distrust in the Arned Forces

and on making Fidel

Cantro appear unstable as a person. If ho has not even

been faithiul to his own "brother," then what can the rent

of then expect 11 they are not even his relatives?

1 think

that we should emphasize the furdamental part that Reul and

Vilma had in consolidation of Castrolm and 1ts xine to power.

I do not think that Almelda has the control nor the

Influence over the Arny that Raul had, and therefore a

conspiracy and revolt of the Armed Forces is easier.

There is no doubt that Fidel la assigning key posts to

men and women who are his personal friends, without

regard to whether they are food or bad Communists. This

In going to bring about probloms with the old guard of the

Communist Party and with the people in the now guard who have

been hastily taught fidel'a dietrine but have received

"ommunist indoctrination (many of them sympathize with Raul).

"It seems that Russia is very displeased with Fidel and

It would not surprise me 11 Russia would try to cause an

ttack on him; we should insinunte this in the propaganda

anainat Castro for we know that his paranoic mentality anc

his disgust for Bussia would most emphatically make him

•tart to purify and take reprisals against Moscow's unconditional

demands; an atmosphere of tension would then be crented

between Russia and Fidel.

The divorce of the Intin American Communist Parties from

thoir obedience to losow, seems to be a reeling of disgust

for Fusela.

I have 200 men rindy, who upon receiving weapons, can be

trier to Cuba 1o mly 18 feuro, In case of a revolt. Their

room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida. The purpose

of the meeting was to formally terminate Artime's association

with the Agency.

This Involved the obtaining of termination

Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover

the final periodical payment through 31 December 1966 and

obtaining outstanding recelpts.

The meeting was cordial and all paper work involved

in the proceedings was accomplished without incident.

There

was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had

done (or tried to do)

for the Agoncy in the past and an un-

doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that he was ready

and willing for any task he might be called upon to do 1n

the future.

3.

Artime made only one request rather passionate

one-for financial asaistance for the immediate fantly membera

of two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR)

members who were executed so the result of operational missions

to Cuba and the wife of another who is serving a 30-year

sentence. (It will be recalled that Artime has been furnishing

receipts for the $3,000 he has been recelving in recent months

claiming that the money goes to the families of MRI members

who have lost their lives or been imprisoned while on MRR

missions.)

We are examining these three cases and if worthy

will arrange for financial benefits under the "survivors and

martyrs" section of the AMBUD activity.

11 he had any items of interest to pass along and was assured

that if ho ever had

any "new" ideas, if he put them in writing,

they would be studied.

It was, however, made very clear to

him that his formal association with the Agency was terminated

and that there was no prospect of any Iinancial assistence i

the foreseeable future.

MARSHAL! paid he did nor care where they

were or what

they cost, he would buy them.

AMBIDDY-1 asked

him why he wanted weapons

so badly, and MARS:All replied that

he was always in the market for weapons.. AYBIDDY-I said he

was aware of that fact, but this did not sound like just

another routine business deal.

He went on

to say that he

would not even consider releasing any of his arms without

knowing where they were going and for what use, and that he

had heard that MARSHALl had sold weapons previously to the

Communists.

He would have nothing to do with sun an opera

regardless of any possible profit in it.

He tried to

but got very little.

MARSHALL said they had a common

which AMBIDDl replied that this was fairly recent as 50..0ZA/

and MARSHAll had been bitter enemies up until about the last

three years.

AMBIDDY-1 said he had to know how rany arus

were wanted, when, where, and for what purpose. MARSHALL said

he wanted all he could yet, as soon as possible, in Costa Rica,

and the reason was that he knew a roup was being prepared and

he wanted to get his own people ready in time.

AMBIDDY-1 said

he would have to think about the proposition and would give

him an ansver in about three weeks.

(He intends to stall and

make no commitments, hoping to drav out more information. He

will not agree to sell any arms.)

" On 7 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked with Daniel

ODUBER at the latter's office.

ODUBER said he was worried

bout all the talk of coup plotting, weapons and other indica

rom of posalble violence.

ODUBER again mentioned to AMBIDDY-1

that he had a fince on the Pacific Coast near the Nicaraguan

border which has an airstrip adequate for a C.46 or 47

type aircraft, and made an effort to feel out AMBIDDY-1 about

the possibility of landing arms on that airstrip. AMBIDDi1

was

noncommital and ODUBER did not press the pointe

AMBIDDY=1 said (as his opinion) that he had gotten

the Impression from talking with MARSHALl and ODUBER that

ODUBER is pushing MARSHAll to stage a coup attempt in the hope

Seria conveniente que Alvarez Tormo pudiera llamar un telefono cada voz que necesito vor al

2-20s agenos de la Embajada cubana temieron una ruptura con Mejieo hace dos semanas y le

comunicaron a Alvarez Torno un sintena de comunicaciones de emergencia, que te envio adjunto

en la propia letra de Alvare: Tormo Antes de venir Alvarez Torno, el cubano lo dijo que la
